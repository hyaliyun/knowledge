These lessons usually teach through the Bible (particularly the New Testament) and through core doctrines of the Church using reading plans and study guides. Programs Lessons can be brief surveys of the Bible or an in-depth historical study of the Old Testament Hebrew and New Testament Greek. Some denominations that have been proponents of the programs include Baptist, Lutheran, Orthodox, Catholic, and Non-denominational. Lessons can vary in form of Bible translation ranging from the King James Version and New King James to the New American Standard Bible and New International Version. When a student completes a study guide, the correspondence course provider corrects the study guide and sends the next lesson. These lessons are unaccredited and provided for free or for a low fee. This makes the courses available to low income students and inmates. These lessons also come in multiple languages such as Spanish, Tagalog, and Portuguese. After completing the course, the student is formally awarded a Certificate of Completion which commonly comes with special privileges within the organization.

The process was originally developed in response to the problem of boot sector viruses on floppy discs. Subsequently, its scope has been expanded to include USB flash drives, portable hard discs, memory cards, CD-ROMs and other removable devices, all of which can potentially carry malware. The name sheep dip is derived from a method of preventing the spread of parasites in a flock of sheep by dipping all of the animals one after another in a trough of pesticide. The term has been in use since at least the early 1990s, though footbath was also used at the time. A sheep dip system can be considered a special case of a sandbox, used to test for malware.  Typical sheep dip system  A sheep dip is normally a stand-alone computer, not connected to any network. It has antivirus software in order to scan removable media and to protect the sheep dip computer itself. The system can be made more effective by having more than one antivirus program, because any single antivirus product will not be able to detect all types of virus.AV-Comparatives independent tests of antivirus sortware It is very important to secure sheep dip computers as strongly as possible against malware, because their role as a first line of defence means that they are particularly likely to be attacked. Software updates should be applied as soon as they become available.getsafeonline.org Software Updates Retrieved on 12 April 2013.

Network connections are avoided for two reasons. Firstly, an Internet connection is a potential attack vector via which the computer could be compromised. Secondly, there is a risk that a worm on a removable device might escape into a local area network if the sheep dip computer is connected to it.  Weaknesses of typical systems  Isolation from networks makes automatic updating impossible, because the sheep dip computer is not able to make contact with the servers from which software updates and antivirus signatures are distributed. It is therefore normal for updates to be applied manually, after they have been downloaded by a separate network-connected computer and copied to a USB flash drive. When a computer's security and antivirus updates are dependent on manual intervention by human beings, the system's security becomes vulnerable to human error. If pressure of work prevents updates from being applied as soon as they become available, a sheep dip computer will gradually become more and more insecure. Absence of network connections also makes it difficult for an organisation to monitor the status of sheep dips if it has deployed them to several different locations. The people with central responsibility for IT security must rely on prompt and accurate reports from those who use the sheep dips. Again, there is a risk of human error.  Active sheep dip system  In an active sheep diphttp://sheepdip.sourceforge.net/ActiveSheepDip.php the antivirus protection is monitored in real time with another program in order to increase security. Antivirus is only effective if it is up-to-date, properly configured, and running. Active sheep dips add an extra layer of security by checking antivirus and intervening if necessary. At the very least, an active sheep dip must disable access to removable media if it detects that its own antivirus signatures are not up-to-date. A more advanced system can be allowed limited network access for automatic updates and remote monitoring, but it must only enable its network connection when there is no immediate malware risk. When the network connection is active all removable media access must be disabled.  References   External links  * -- Open source active sheep dip software.

Over time it has served as a residence of merchants, a tenement house, and later on, in the Soviet Union period, the building was used as Railway Club and afterwards as the Union of Food Workers‚Äô ‚ÄúPalace of Culture‚Äù. After many years of abandonment due to the fire which destroyed most part of the building, it went through major restoration of what was left of the construction, and renovation to open as the one and only hotel under the name of The State Hermitage Museum. History Formation of the quarter between Zagorodny Prospect and Dostoevskogo Street, where the hotel's building is located, dates back to the beginning of the 19th century. Since 1739 Pravda Street was a part of Bolshaya Ofitserskaya Street and in 1829 it was given a name of its own: Cabinetskaya, as His Royal Highness Offices (Cabinet) were located here. It was laid to link Palace Village, located around the Vladimirskaya Church with the Life Guard of the Semenovsky Regiment lodgings. In 1932 Cabinetskaya Street was renamed after the Pravda newspaper, which was published in the area and from then the name remained unchanged.

In the 1830 the ownership was passed to I. Lbov, a merchant of the 1st Guild. The first mentions of the building itself date from 1835, when the initial architectural plans were submitted to the Administrative Board of the City. The initial plan made by architect Kholopov depicted a three-storey building with a front and 2 wings. The main residential section, consisting of two storeys, extended across the courtyard and was abutted by a three-storey wing on the right and a single-storey construction on the left, giving the building the look of a Russian letter ‚Äú–ü‚Äù.Central State Historical Archives of St.Petersburg f. 513, list 102, file 4826 \\"Reconstruction plans 1835-1912\\" The general style of the building and details of design evidently attributed Pravda 10 to the period of strict classicism. The architectural plan of 1835 In June 1835, a new plan was submitted to Administrative Board of the City. The project suggested building of two-storey construction at the back of the courtyard, with a balcony of three windows and chiseled grating, and with the entrance to the garden located under the balcony. Architectural details of the fa√ßade were quite demure: plain window casing, every second window with ledges above.Central State Historical Archives of St.Petersburg f. 513, list 102, file 4826 \\"Reconstruction plans 1835-1912\\" One wing was supposed to be of three storeys with six doors on the ground floor, the other wing ‚Äì one-storey - with four wide openings and a door in the center, most probably to be used as a coach- house. One of the proposals of the project suggested closing of the clear passage to the garden by means of creating an addition to the main building for it to occupy the whole plot. This project was approved, and the addition was built.Central State Historical Archives of St.Petersburg f. 513, list 102, file 4826 \\"Reconstruction plans 1835-1912\\" Yet another project for reconstruction of the building was proposed by architect A. Andrianov in 1837. At that time, two storeys of the house across the plot were already built, with 15 windows on the first floor and a port-cochere on the ground floor of addition of the building. Despite the fact that the mansion was in the ownership of merchants, not a single design cast an impression of provinciality, on the contrary, the designs showed the dynamics of development of existing buildings, their continuous improvement, simplification of architectural forms and details. The ownership of the estate was passed to the son of the honorary citizen, Alexander Ivanovich Lbov on June 25, 1873. Later in the 1870s, Pravda 10 had yet other honorable residents: Brigadier General Peter von Briskorn, Court Councilor A.N. Ladoga, and Ministry of Internal Affairs Officer Court Councilor I.S. Remizov. The mansion did not undergo any alterations until 1889, when it was sold to a new owner ‚Äì noble by birth, bachelor of laws, Theodor Kruse. Six months after he bought the estate, Kruse submitted a proposal, prepared by architect Kovshirya, for reconstruction of the right wing, construction of a cellar and of a stone fence. The new wing was supposed to be made of brick with two gates and entrance in the center.Central State Historical Archives of St.Petersburg f. 513, list 102, file 4826 \\"Reconstruction plans 1835-1912\\"Cental State Historical Archives of St.Petersburg f. 515, list 1, file 2386 \\"The Description of the estate of Theodore Kruze at Cabinetskaya Street 10\\" In October 1890 the mansion with all the additions was mortgaged, and for some time the estate belonged to a retired Captain of Cavalry Ilia Petrovich Larionov and was used as tenement house. The building underwent a thorough overhaul; the courtyard was separated from the street by exuberant metal fence on stony base, a garden was laid out around all the buildings.Central State Historical Archives of St.Petersburg f. 513, list 102, file 4826 \\"Reconstruction plans 1835-1912\\" A few years later the estate was sold to Chief Chamberlain the Adjutant General Nikolai Vasilievich Voeykov. In 1895 architect Bikarukov E.F. prepared a plan for another reconstruction of the building proposing to put up a new coach house with three gates, preserving the architectural details of the opposite construction and adding a storey to the existing wing. The project was taken into consideration and approved by the Head of the Board Nikolai Benoit.Central State Historical Archives of St.Petersburg f. 513, list 102, file 4826 \\"Reconstruction plans 1835-1912\\" In March 1901, the widow of the Adjutant General Varvara Voeykova and her daughter Maria decided to rebuild the house. They submitted a project for reconstruction to the Administrative Board of the City of St. Petersburg. According to this project, a new stone five-storey house with modern style fa√ßade and various architectural details facing Cabinetskaya Street (Pravda nowadays) was to be built. Narrow courtyard was to be surrounded by two six-storey wings with plain fa√ßades. The front of the house was to have two high wooden gates with an archway passage to the yard decorated with a wrought lattice next to the main entrance with glass doors. The project was approved, but, probably never executed.Cental State Historical Archives of St.Petersburg f. 513, list 147, file 39 \\"About the Permission to build 5 storey construction in the yard of Voyekova\\" By 1912 the plot with all the buildings and the garden became in the ownership of Railway Administration. The large-scale reconstruction of the estate was carried out by the architect Alexander Golubkov. The project suggested reconstruction and reworking of the ground and first floors of the main and side wings; the main building was to be extended in order to set up a spectators‚Äô hall with the capacity of 450 people with windows looking out at the garden. Sports and club facilities were located at the wings. Fa√ßades were to be completely reworked and interiors to be decorated with plasterwork to turn the building neo- classism. After the overhaul was carried out, Pravda 10 became the home of Petrogradskiy Railway Club.Central State Archives of St. Petersburg f.192, list 3-1, file 5539 \\"Plans of Union of Food Workers Palace of Culture\\" After the Revolution of 1917, the building, which had been abandoned for quite some time, was used as Union of Food Workers Palace of Culture. In 1936-1937 was rebuilt by the architect V.P. Makashev. In general, fa√ßade had classic proportions and d√©cor; hexastyle porticos with balconies were added to the wings on the first and second floors. Slender columns with Ionic capitals upheld the chiseled gratings balconies of the second floor. All the perimeter of the ground floor was rustic; deep windows of the first floor were separated by pilasters; above-window niches had geometric ornament with rosace in the center. Deep, two-piece windows of the principal fa√ßade, looking out on the spectators‚Äô hall, had semicircle finishing and above-window niches were decorated with floral ornament, semicircle crenelated moldings.Central State Archives of St. Petersburg f.192, list 3-1, file 5539 \\"Plans of Union of Food Workers Palace of Culture\\" On 6 November 1937, a monument dedicated to Vladimir Lenin was put up at the cour d‚Äôhonneur of the Union of Food Workers Palace of Culture. Over the years, a small cafeteria located at the ground floor transformed into ‚ÄúVostok‚Äù - the first club of bard singers in the country. In the 1960s Kukin and Gorodnitskiy, Klyachkin and Okudzhava performed here. It was here where St. Petersburg heard Vladimir Vysotskiy for the first time. This scene has also seen Boris Grebenshikov, Viktor Tsoy, and Sergey Kurekhin, and Yanka Dzyagileva perform. During Soviet Union times, the Beatles fans celebrated John Lennon's birthday here. The spot was also used to hold Alexander Bashlachev, Russian poet and rock singer, commemoration meetings. In 1999, the Palace of Culture was closed down for renovation, which never took place. Abandoned after a destructive fire in 2005, it was bought and restored to its glory days and will open as the one and only luxury hotel under the name of The Official State Hermitage Museum in summer 2013.

Gaspard and John developed France's field artillery, standardising its calibre and switching it from wrought iron to cast iron. This gave the French army a decisive advantage over the English and helped bring an end to the Hundred Years' War. Gaspard took part in the 1450 siege of Bayeux and the battle of Castillon in 1453. On 21 March 1445 he bought the lordship of Villemomble from Francis I, Duke of Brittany for 9,000 livres tournois. He was made marquis of Castillon then a knight in 1464. He finally became captain of Beaut√©, Le Louvre and Poissy between 1463 and 1465. Marriage and issue He first married around 1440, to Guarix Burelle, with whom he had no children. His second marriage was around 1450, to Richarde de V√©rines, with whom he had three daughters: *Jeanne Bureau, married Jean de Marcirion, lord of La Tombe *Marguerite Bureau, married twice 1)Yves de Carnazet; 2) Charles de Buz. *G√©rarde (alias Gasparde) Bureau, lady of Douy and of La Ram√©e, married twice 1) Robert de Ch√¢tillon, lord of Bry-sur-Marne; 2) Pierre de Meaux.

The park is named for its two separate sections: Khao Lampi named for the park section containing Lampi mountain range and Hat Thai Mueang, the beach section of the park. Geography Khao Lampi‚ÄìHat Thai Mueang National Park is located in Thai Mueang district, north of Phuket city and about west of Phang Nga town. The park lies just off Route 4 (Phetkasem Road). The park's total area is and its highest peak is Yot Khao Kanim mountain, in the northern part of the eastern section at . History Previously known as Lampi Waterfall and Lampi Forest Park, Khao Lampi‚ÄìHat Thai Mueang became Thailand's 52nd national park on 14 April 1986. Attractions The park is best known for its large waterfalls located in the mountainous eastern section. The largest of these is Ton Phrai Waterfall, high and best seen during the rainy season. The park's namesake waterfall, Lampi, is of similar height but lesser volume and falls in numerous tiers. The Hat Thai Mueang section consists of a pristine white sand Andaman Sea beach backed by a mangrove forest. A distinguishing feature of the beach (and a prime reason for its protected status) is that it is a sea turtle nesting area. Between November and February sea turtles come to this stretch of beach to lay eggs. In March, a local festival marks when many of the newly hatched baby turtles make their way to the sea. Flora and fauna The park's eastern section is covered in tropical rainforest, including such tree species as Dipterocarpus, Anisoptera costata, Hopea odorata and bullet wood. Bamboo and rattan are found at lower levels. In the park's beach section, mangrove forests are found along brackish canals which feed from higher ground into the sea. The mangroves play a protective ecological role in numerous respects including filtration of water from higher ground and providing a sea life nursery. Additionally, the wave energy of the 2004 tsunami was dissipated somewhat by the mangroves in this area. Further back from the seafront, beach forest is found including such species as Casuarina equisetifolia, Terminalia catappa, Derris indica and Barringtonia. Swamp forest is also present in this area and is one of the few areas on the Andaman sea coast featuring such an ecosystem. Mammals include Sumatran serow, Malayan tapir, lar gibbon and Malayan sun bear. palm civet and sambar deer are also found. Turtle species include leatherback, green and hawksbill. Pythons and Malayan pit vipers are also present. Leatherback sea turtles swim seasonally to lay eggs on Thai Mueang Beach in the park. Thailand was once a sanctuary for leatherback turtles. Monitoring between 2003‚Äì2013 at Thai Mueang Beach found turtles laid 2,678 eggs there and 1,574, or 58.7 percent survived. The species is disappearing. Irresponsible trawler fishing is one of the factors to blame. Property development on the beach has kept the turtles away. Another factor is the traditional belief that consuming turtle eggs boost one's sexual prowess. There have been reports of villagers selling leatherback eggs for up to 150 baht each. Freshwater fish include rare species such as non-local Nile tilapia, saltwater eel and Hemibagrus wyckii species of catfish. Less rare species such as Nieuhof's walking catfish and blue panchax are also found here. Khao Lampi‚ÄìHat Thai Mueang is home to at least 188 bird species, including black-thighed falconet, oriental honey-buzzard, red junglefowl and thick-billed pigeon.

The doctrine of mechanism in philosophy comes in two different flavors. They are both doctrines of metaphysics, but they are different in scope and ambitions: the first is a global doctrine about nature; the second is a local doctrine about humans and their minds, which is hotly contested. For clarity, we might distinguish these two doctrines as universal mechanism and anthropic mechanism.  Universal mechanism  The older doctrine, here called universal mechanism, is the ancient philosophies closely linked with materialism and reductionism, especially that of the atomists and to a large extent, stoic physics. They held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles‚Äîthat is, the motion and collision of matter. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the scientific revolution had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of 'mechanical' laws, natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that implied a thorough going determinism: if all phenomena could be explained entirely through the motion of matter under the laws of classical physics, then even more surely than the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, all phenomena must be completely determined: whether past, present or future. (One of the philosophical implications of modern quantum mechanics is that this view of determinism is not defensible.) The French mechanist and determinist Pierre Simon de Laplace formulated the sweeping implications of this thesis by saying: One of the first and most famous expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes (1651). What is less frequently appreciated is that Ren√© Descartes was a staunch mechanist, though today, in the philosophy of mind, he is remembered for introducing the mind‚Äìbody problem in terms of dualism and physicalism. Descartes was a substance dualist, and argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended matter, on the one hand, and immaterial mind, on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was thoroughly mechanistic in nature: :\\"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine‚Äôs organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels.\\" (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108) His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic automata. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences. Isaac Newton ushered in a much weaker acceptation of mechanism that tolerated the antithetical, and as yet inexplicable, action at a distance of gravity. However, his work seemed to successfully predict the motion of both celestial and terrestrial bodies according to that principle, and the generation of philosophers who were inspired by Newton's example carried the mechanist banner nonetheless. Chief among them were French philosophers such as Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Denis Diderot (see also: French materialism).  Anthropic mechanism  The thesis in anthropic mechanism is not that everything can be completely explained in mechanical terms (although some anthropic mechanists may also believe that), but rather that everything about human beings can be completely explained in mechanical terms, as surely as can everything about clocks or the internal combustion engine. One of the chief obstacles that all mechanistic theories have faced is providing a mechanistic explanation of the human mind; Descartes, for one, endorsed dualism in spite of endorsing a completely mechanistic conception of the material world because he argued that mechanism and the notion of a mind be logically incompatible. Hobbes, on the other hand, conceived of the mind and the will as purely mechanistic, completely explicable in terms of the effects of perception and the pursuit of desire, which in turn he held to be completely explicable in terms of the materialistic operations of the nervous system. Following Hobbes, other mechanists argued for a thoroughly mechanistic explanation of the mind, with one of the most influential and controversial expositions of the doctrine being offered by Julien Offray de La Mettrie in his Man a Machine (1748). The main points of debate between anthropic mechanists and anti-mechanists are mainly occupied with two topics: the mind‚Äîconsciousness, in particular‚Äîand free will. Anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism be incompatible with our commonsense intuitions: in philosophy of mind they argue that if matter is devoid of mental properties, then the phenomenon of consciousness cannot be explained by mechanistic principles acting on matter. In metaphysics anti- mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism implies determinism about human action, which is incompatible with our experience of free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this position include Norman Malcolm and David Chalmers. Anthropic mechanists typically respond in one of two ways. In the first, they agree with anti-mechanists that mechanism conflicts with some of our commonsense intuitions, but go on to argue that our commonsense intuitions are simply mistaken and need to be revised. Down this path lies eliminative materialism in philosophy of mind, and hard determinism on the question of free will. This option is accepted by the eliminative materialist philosopher Paul Churchland. Some have questioned how eliminative materialism is compatible with the freedom of will apparently required for anyone (including its adherents) to make truth claims.Hans Jonas, The Phenomenon of Life: Toward a Philosophical Biology (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2001/1966), p. 175. The second option, common amongst philosophers who adopt anthropic mechanism, is to argue that the arguments given for incompatibility are specious: whatever it is we mean by \\"consciousness\\" and \\"free will,\\" be fully compatible with a mechanistic understanding of the human mind and will. As a result, they tend to argue for one or another non-eliminativist physicalist theories of mind, and for compatibilism on the question of free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this sort of account include J. J. C. Smart and Daniel Dennett. G√∂delian arguments Some scholars have debated over what, if anything, G√∂del's incompleteness theorems imply about anthropic mechanism. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a Turing machine, or by the Church-Turing thesis, any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is consistent, then G√∂del's incompleteness theorems would apply to it. G√∂delian arguments claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent and powerful enough to recognize its own consistency. Since this is impossible for a Turing machine, the G√∂delian concludes that human reasoning must be non-mechanical. However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent \\"idealized version\\" H of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of H (otherwise H is provably inconsistent); and that G√∂del's theorems do not lead to any valid argument against mechanism.Mark Colyvan. An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. Cambridge University Press, 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of G√∂del's incompleteness results': \\"The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail.\\" This consensus that G√∂delian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in Artificial Intelligence: \\"any attempt to utilize [G√∂del's incompleteness results] to attack the computationalist thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis.\\"LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why G√∂del's theorem cannot refute computationalism. Artificial Intelligence, 104:265‚Äì286, 1998. =History= One of the earliest attempts to use incompleteness to reason about human intelligence was by G√∂del himself in his 1951 Gibbs Lecture entitled \\"Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their philosophical implications\\".G√∂del, Kurt, 1951, Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications in Solomon Feferman, ed., 1995. Collected works / Kurt G√∂del, Vol. III. Oxford University Press: 304-23. In this lecture, G√∂del uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist Diophantine equations for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. G√∂del finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a \\"certain fact\\". In subsequent years, more direct anti-mechanist lines of reasoning were apparently floating around the intellectual atmosphere. In 1960, Hilary Putnam published a paper entitled \\"Minds and Machines,\\" in which he points out the flaws of a typical anti-mechanist argument.Putnam, Hilary, 1960, Minds and Machines in Sidney Hook, ed., Dimensions of Mind: A Symposium. New York University Press. Reprinted in Anderson, A. R., ed., 1964. Minds and Machines. Prentice-Hall: 77. Informally, this is the argument that the (alleged) difference between \\"what can be mechanically proven\\" and \\"what can be seen to be true by humans\\" shows that human intelligence is not mechanical in nature. Or, as Putnam puts it: > Let T be a Turing machine which \\"represents\\" me in the sense that T can > prove just the mathematical statements I prove. Then using G√∂del's technique > I can discover a proposition that T cannot prove, and moreover I can prove > this proposition. This refutes the assumption that T \\"represents\\" me, hence > I am not a Turing machine. Hilary Putnam objects that this argument ignores the issue of consistency. G√∂del's technique can only be applied to consistent systems. It is conceivable, argues Putnam, that the human mind is inconsistent. If one is to use G√∂del's technique to prove the proposition that T cannot prove, one must first prove (the mathematical statement representing) the consistency of T, a daunting and perhaps impossible task. Later Putnam suggested that while G√∂del's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. If we are to believe that it is consistent, then either we cannot prove its consistency, or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.The G√∂del Theorem and Human Nature, a talk given by Hilary Putnam in the G√∂del centenary 2006 J. R. Lucas in Minds, Machines and G√∂del (1961), and later in his book The Freedom of the Will (1970), lays out an anti-mechanist argument closely following the one described by Putnam, including reasons for why the human mind can be considered consistent.Lucas, J. R., 1961, \\"Minds, Machines, and G√∂del.\\" Philosophy 36:112-27. Lucas admits that, by G√∂del's second theorem, a human mind cannot formally prove its own consistency, and even says (perhaps facetiously) that women and politicians are inconsistent. Nevertheless, he sets out arguments for why a male non- politician can be considered consistent. These arguments are philosophical in nature and are the subject of much debate; Lucas provides references to responses on his own website. Another work was done by Judson Webb in his 1968 paper \\"Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind\\".Webb, Judson, 1968, \\"Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind,\\" Philosophy of Science 35: 156‚Äì78. Webb claims that previous attempts have glossed over whether one truly can see that the G√∂delian statement p pertaining to oneself, is true. Using a different formulation of G√∂del's theorems, namely, that of Raymond Smullyan and Emil Post, Webb shows one can derive convincing arguments for oneself of both the truth and falsity of p. He furthermore argues that all arguments about the philosophical implications of G√∂del's theorems are really arguments about whether the Church-Turing thesis is true. Later, Roger Penrose entered the fray, providing somewhat novel anti-mechanist arguments in his books, The Emperor's New Mind (1989) [ENM] and Shadows of the Mind (1994) [SM]. These books have proved highly controversial. Martin Davis responded to ENM in his paper \\"Is Mathematical Insight Algorithmic?\\" (ps), where he argues that Penrose ignores the issue of consistency. Solomon Feferman gives a critical examination of SM in his paper \\"Penrose's G√∂delian argument\\" (pdf). The response of the scientific community to Penrose's arguments has been negative, with one group of scholars calling Penrose's repeated attempts to form a persuasive G√∂delian argument \\"a kind of intellectual shell game, in which a precisely defined notion to which a mathematical result applies... is switched for a vaguer notion\\". A G√∂del-based anti-mechanism argument can be found in Douglas Hofstadter's book G√∂del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, though Hofstadter is widely viewed as a known skeptic of such arguments: > Looked at this way, G√∂del's proof suggests ‚Äì though by no means does it > prove! ‚Äì that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mind/brain, > involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level > might have explanatory power that does not exist ‚Äì not even in principle ‚Äì > on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be explained on the > high level quite easily, but not on lower levels at all.

It is analogous to the fact that, if you make > derivation after derivation in Peano arithmetic, no matter how long and > cumbersome you make them, you will never come up with one for G ‚Äì despite > the fact that on a higher level, you can see that the G√∂del sentence is > true.

Biography  Igor Vulokh was born in Kazan on January 3, 1938. His childhood and early youth spanned the war and post-war years. His father Alexander went off to war, and his mother Lidia was left alone. His father died in 1942 and his mother became hospitalized from hunger and exhaustion. Vulokh was not aware that his mother was in hospital and he ended up in a children's home. After the war Lidia searched for Igor and finally found him. From his early youth, Vulokh had a penchant for art. His first sketches, very bright and clear, astonished the teachers of Kazan Art School, where he studied painting from 1953 to 1958. As a student, Vulokh was greatly influenced by his teacher Victor Podursky (professor at the Shanghai Art Academy and a connoisseur of Japanese and Chinese art). His landscape Winter displayed at the All-Soviet Art Exhibition of 1957 at the Moscow Manege, brought him his first recognition: two positives reviews by the classic Soviet sculptor Konenkov and Yuon appeared in international newspaper. Vulokh applied to the Surikov Institute in Moscow but is not admitted. Thanks to the protection of the well- known painter Georgy Nissky, Vulokh enter the Art Department the All-Soviet State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK). The VGIK residence hall is a singular site for encounters. There, Igor Vulokh's roommate was Naum Kleiman, then a student at the Department of Cinematography and now the director of the Museum of Cinema. The writer Vasily Shukshin also became a good friend. At the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Vulokhh meet the young artist Anatoly Zverev. His drawings caught Vulokhh's attention thanks to their unusual and vivid style. A passion for painting brought the notice artists together, and they become good friends. That same year, Vulokh married Kira Viktorova. The VI International Youth Festival in 1957 in Sokolnoki Park U.S. and French Pavilions and personal retrospective of Pablo Picasso. For Vulokhh, studies at VGIK, where students had the unique opportunity to see rare films that were often inaccessible to the public at large, were interesting but also quite burdensome. He had no need for most subjects connected with Soviet dogma, or those having to do with filmmaking. In 1960, he quit the Institute of Cinematography and began to engage in the creative process freely.  The friends of these years  The year 1961 was a landmark in Vulokh's career. He met the poet Gennady Aigi, the ‚Äúfriend of these year‚Äù at the house of Naum Kleiman, who was working at the State Film Foundation in Belye Stolby. Subsequently, they formed a poet-artist duo: Igor made a series of sketchers based on Aigi's remarkably traditional yet innovative poetry. Aigi dedicated a cycle of poems to Vulokh. There was something in the field too: That lived like Jesus in a person: This had been taken out long ago! As ‚Äútwin field‚Äù Vulokh and Aigi understood each other right away. Common intellectual pursuits, artistic tastes, and spiritual kinship drew close together. Later on, both worked as editors of the catalog Mayakovsky Artist published in 1961. Gennady Aigi was closely familiar with the first avant-garde movement and was a great connoisseur of poetry, studying forbidden as well as forgotten works of literature. He worked at the Mayakovsky Museum, whose visitors included Nikolai Khardzhiev and Aleksei Kruchenykh, who organized exhibitions of avant-garde artist of the twenties ‚Äì Tatlin, Malevich, Larionov, Goncharova, Filiniv, etc. (Vulokh was especially close with Khardzhiev and greatly influenced by him) / These were major events, and they that resonated throughout Europe. Among the rare foreigners living in Moscow who took an interest in the Russia avant-garde art of the time was the Danish art historian Troels Andersen (today, the director of Silkebord Art Museum in Denmark). A connoisseur and lover of the Russian avant-garde, Andersen subsequently wrote a four-volume work on Kazimir Malevich and organized a retrospective of his work in New York. Aigi acquainted Vulokh with a circle of people who were capable of understanding and appreciating his art. This was a unique exchange of knowledge, feeling, and artistic explorations ‚Äì similar to the situation depicted in the film ‚ÄúVocal Parallels‚Äù. A reserved person by nature, Vulokh found a friend and new hope in Aigi. The poet and the artist published a dozen books done jointly in Russia and abroad. In 1989, the cycle of poetry ‚ÄúVeronika's Notebook‚Äù (translated by Peter France) was published in England. Dedicated to Aigi's newborn daughter Veronika, the book was illustrated by Igor Vulokh. Subsequently, a series of poems dedicated by Aigi to Vulokh were published as a separate book with the emblematic title ‚ÄúFriend of These Years‚Äù (1998), for which Vulokh also made a series of illustrations. The year 1961 was also marked by Vulokh's first solo exhibition in Moscow at the Exhibition Room of Union of Artists. That year, Vulokh also joined the youth section of the Moscow Union of Artists. Igor Vulokh learned of famous collector George Kostaki, whose apartment walls, according to eyewitnesses, were completely covered by works of Russian avant-garde artists of the Twenties. Vulokh and Kostaki's friendship began in 1968, and Vulokh still retains particular and warm memories of Kostakis remarkable collections.  Divinity school is the center of the universe  In 1968, Vulokh begins to make white minimalist paintings. He will periodically return to the theme of ‚Äúpure white‚Äù over his entire career. These subtle works in pastel hues make up his so-called ‚ÄúWhite Period‚Äù. At that time, his spiritual strivings and study of theological works brought Vulokh to the Divinity School at Trinity-Sergius Monastery. There he became an assistant in the Department of Western Religions. At the same time, Vulokh continued to work actively, experimenting with different areas of painting.  Opposites sometimes meet  Vulokh was admitted to the Moscow Branch of the USSR Union of Artists in 1971. Membership in the Union of Artists allowed Vulokh to focus on his artistic activities and dispose of his time as he saw fit instead of working nine to five. Despite Vulokh's complex artistic process and his reserved personality, which often showed a cool Scandinavian side, there were always people around who understood him and tried to hell. The sculptor Vyacheslav Klykov was utterly different from Igor: a strong man who is incredibly active yet also sensitive. Klykov organized a joint exhibition of their work in 1979 (something that was unthinkable at the time). A catalog with Vulokh's works remains from the show. After the exhibition, several of his works entered the collection of the Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg. At the certain moment, Vulokh understood that his and Klykov's views diverged significantly. A line was draw between the pair, and after have passed they parted ways.  White period  In 1983, Igor met his future wife, the artists Natalya Tukolkina-Okhota, at the house of Vasily Grigoriev (the son of Renita and Yuri Grigoriev), which Igor had been frequenting for some time. She already ‚Äúknew‚Äù Vulokh through his works. In the context of reality of times, they struck her with their novelty, originality, and powerful impact. This encounter opened a new world in art for the young man. In 1985, their daughter Lidia was born. With the appearance of family and stability, the White Period fully formed and began to occupy an ever-greater place in Vulokh's, as a sort of reflection of all the joyous events of his life that took place in those years. In 1988, Troels published in Denmark the first monograph about Vulokh, whose art was still not officially recognized in Russia. The preface to the book contained Gennady Aigi's Twelve Parallels to Igor Vulokh.  Vanishing boundaries  The Moscow Segodnya Gallery was one of the first to exhibit and advertise works of the ‚Äúsixties artists‚Äù. It promoted Russian art abroad, and many works were regularly Russian art abroad, and many works were regularly sent to international art fairs. Igor Vulokh's solo exhibition at Segodnya Gallery was the first time that the broad Russian public could get acquainted with his work. The artworks were purchased by the Tretykov Gallery. In those years there was a lot of interest in Russian art in the West. In 1991, Vulokh went to West Berlin on the occasion of a solo exhibition of his work at the Brauner and PopovGallery. In 1993, Vulokh received a fellowship from Brandenburg and goes with his wife for a residential stay at Wiepersdorf Castle in Germany. This fellowship was awarded by the international community to eminent artists from different countries. This trip gave Igor a lot of experience in communicating with a broad international circle of literary and artistic cultural figures. In 1994, Vulokh made a series of graphic illustrations for the poetry of the major contemporary Swedish poet Tomas Transtremer; this series was subsequently exhibited at the Transtremer Poetry Festival on the Isle of Gotland. Igor Vulokh asked the Brandenburg administration to donate the paintings that he made in Wiepersdorf to the Danish Museum of Art, whose director is Troels Andersen. This led to the organization of Vulokh's solo exhibition and his trip to Denmark. Andrsen's museum had an enormous archive on history of international art. In addition to getting acquainted with very rare works on the history of art, Vulokh got artistic inspiration from this trip. The exhibition was successful, while his works acquired museum status in the West.  Deserved reward  In 1996, the Ministry of Culture nominated Vulokh for the State Prize. In Soviet times, the Prize was awarded only to recognized masters of socialist realism. The gesture was a token of the long-awaited recognition of underground art by the state. Underground artists were nominated for this prize for the first time in Russian history. A few years before, the Swiss banker and collector Urs Haener began to take an interest in Vulokh's work. Together with Swiss gallery owner Nadja Brykina, Haener made a trip to Vulokh's studio, examines his works, and asked about their origins. Haener, an exceptional individual, astounded Igor with his knowledge and understanding of contemporary art. His passionate enthralment and sincere desire to make Vulokh's works know to the world as quickly as possible were truly astonishing. For many years, Urs Haener collected Vulokh's works and give him assistance. At the same time, the Soros Foundation awarded Vulokh a grant in 2001 for the catalog of a successful exhibition at the Fine Art Gallery. A few years later, in 2006, Urs Haener orchestrates the publication of a wonderful book about Vulokh ‚Äì the first and biggest monograph, in several languages simultaneously. The publication of the monograph was followed by another solo exhibition of Vulokh's work, this time at the Nadja Brykina Gallery in Switzerland. Troels Andersen was invited as a special expert in charge of selecting works. He arranged them in groups and wrote a critical review for each group. The exhibition, held in Zuruch in 2006, was a success, receiving rave reviews from Western critics.  Today and always  Igor Vulokh worked until his death. He died on the night of November 28, 2012 in hospital. Today Vulokh's works are sold at all the leading international Auction houses, including Sotheby's and MacDougall's. After George Kostaki's Family transferred part of his collection to Thessaloniki, an exhibition was held in 2006, and a catalog was published with fifteen early works by the artist.

This adaptation means irreversible, long-term physiological responses to high-altitude environments, associated with heritable behavioural and genetic changes. While the rest of the human population would suffer serious health consequences, the indigenous inhabitants of these regions thrive well in the highest parts of the world. These people have undergone extensive physiological and genetic changes, particularly in the regulatory systems of oxygen respiration and blood circulation, when compared to the general lowland population. Around 140 million people, just under 2% of the world's human population, live permanently at altitudes above in South America, East Africa, and South Asia. These populations have done so for millennia without apparent complications. This special adaptation is now recognised as an example of natural selection in action. The adaptation of the Tibetans is the fastest known example of human evolution, as it is estimated to have occurred any time around 1,000 B.C.E. to 7,000 B.C.E. Origin and basis Himalayas, on the southern rim of the Tibetan Plateau Humans are naturally adapted to lowland environment where oxygen is abundant. When people from the general lowlands go to altitudes above they experience altitude sickness, which is a type of hypoxia, a clinical syndrome of severe lack of oxygen. Some people get the illness even at above 1,500 metres (5,000 ft). Complications include fatigue, dizziness, breathlessness, headaches, insomnia, malaise, nausea, vomiting, body pain, loss of appetite, ear-ringing, blistering and purpling of the hands and feet, and dilated veins. The sickness is compounded by related symptoms such as cerebral oedema (swelling of brain) and pulmonary oedema (fluid accumulation in lungs). For several days, they breathe excessively and burn extra energy even when the body is relaxed. The heart rate then gradually decreases. Hypoxia, in fact, is one of the principal causes of death among mountaineers. In women, pregnancy can be severely affected, such as development of high blood pressure, called preeclampsia, which causes premature labour, low birth weight of babies, and often complicated with profuse bleeding, seizures, and death of the mother. More than 140 million people worldwide are estimated to live at an elevation higher than above sea level, of which 13 million are in Ethiopia, 1.7 million in Tibet (total of 78 million in Asia), 35 million in the South American Andes, and 0.3 million in Colorado Rocky Mountains. Certain natives of Tibet, Ethiopia, and the Andes have been living at these high altitudes for generations and are protected from hypoxia as a consequence of genetic adaptation. It is estimated that at , every lungful of air only has 60% of the oxygen molecules that people at sea level have. Highlanders are thus constantly exposed to a low oxygen environment, yet they live without any debilitating problems. One of the best documented effects of high altitude is a progressive reduction in birth weight. It has been known that women of long- resident high-altitude population are not affected. These women are known to give birth to heavier-weight infants than women of lowland inhabitants. This is particularly true among Tibetan babies, whose average birth weight is 294‚Äì650 (~470) g heavier than the surrounding Chinese population; and their blood-oxygen level is considerably higher. The first scientific investigations of high-altitude adaptation was done by A. Roberto Frisancho of the University of Michigan in the late 1960s among the Quechua people of Peru. Paul T. Baker, Penn State University, (in the Department of Anthropology) also conducted a considerable amount of research into human adaptation to high altitudes, and mentored students who continued this research. One of these students, anthropologist Cynthia Beall of Case Western Reserve University, began to conduct research on high altitude adaptation among the Tibetans in the early 1980s, still doing so to this day. Physiological basis Tibetans A Sherpa family Scientists started to notice the extraordinary physical performance of Tibetans since the beginning of Himalayan climbing era in the early 20th century. The hypothesis of a possible evolutionary genetic adaptation makes sense. The Tibetan plateau has an average elevation of above sea level, and covering more than 2.5 million km2, it is the highest and largest plateau in the world. In 1990, it was estimated that 4,594,188 Tibetans live on the plateau, with 53% living at an altitude over . Fairly large numbers (about 600,000) live at an altitude exceeding in the Chantong- Qingnan area. Where the Tibetan highlanders live, the oxygen level is only about 60% of that at sea level. The Tibetans, who have been living in this region for 3,000 years, do not exhibit the elevated haemoglobin concentrations to cope with oxygen deficiency as observed in other populations who have moved temporarily or permanently at high altitudes. Instead, the Tibetans inhale more air with each breath and breathe more rapidly than either sea-level populations or Andeans. Tibetans have better oxygenation at birth, enlarged lung volumes throughout life, and a higher capacity for exercise. They show a sustained increase in cerebral blood flow, lower haemoglobin concentration, and less susceptibility to chronic mountain sickness than other populations, due to their longer history of high-altitude habitation. Individuals can develop short-term tolerance with careful physical preparation and systematic monitoring of movements, but the biological changes are quite temporary and reversible when they return to lowlands. Moreover, unlike lowland people who only experience increased breathing for a few days after entering high altitudes, Tibetans retain this rapid breathing and elevated lung-capacity throughout their lifetime. This enables them to inhale larger amounts of air per unit of time to compensate for low oxygen levels. In addition, they have high levels (mostly double) of nitric oxide in their blood, when compared to lowlanders, and this probably helps their blood vessels dilate for enhanced blood circulation. Further, their haemoglobin level is not significantly different (average 15.6 g/dl in males and 14.2 g/dl in females), from those of people living at low altitude. (Normally, mountaineers experience >2 g/dl increase in Hb level at Mt. Everest base camp in two weeks.) In this way they are able to evade both the effects of hypoxia and mountain sickness throughout life. Even when they climbed the highest summits like Mt. Everest, they showed regular oxygen uptake, greater ventilation, more brisk hypoxic ventilatory responses, larger lung volumes, greater diffusing capacities, constant body weight and a better quality of sleep, compared to people from the lowland. Andeans In contrast to the Tibetans, the Andean highlanders, who have been living at high altitudes for no more than 11,000 years, show different pattern of haemoglobin adaptation. Their haemoglobin concentration is higher compared to those of lowlander population, which also happens to lowlanders moving to high altitude. When they spend some weeks in the lowland their haemoglobin drops to average of other people. This shows only temporary and reversible acclimatisation. However, in contrast to lowland people, they do have increased oxygen level in their haemoglobin, that is, more oxygen per blood volume than other people. This confers an ability to carry more oxygen in each red blood cell, making a more effective transport of oxygen in their body, while their breathing is essentially at the same rate. This enables them to overcome hypoxia and normally reproduce without risk of death for the mother or baby. The Andean highlanders are known from the 16th-century missionaries that their reproduction had always been normal, without any effect in the giving birth or the risk for early pregnancy loss, which are common to hypoxic stress. They have developmentally acquired enlarged residual lung volume and its associated increase in alveolar area, which are supplemented with increased tissue thickness and moderate increase in red blood cells. Though the physical growth in body size is delayed, growth in lung volumes is accelerated. An incomplete adaptation such as elevated haemoglobin levels still leaves them at risk for mountain sickness with old age. Quechua woman with llamas Among the Quechua people of the Altiplano, there is a significant variation in NOS3 (the gene encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase, eNOS), which is associated with higher levels of nitric oxide in high altitude. Nu√±oa children of Quechua ancestry exhibit higher blood- oxygen content (91.3) and lower heart rate (84.8) than their counterpart school children of different ethnicity, who have an average of 89.9 blood- oxygen and 88‚Äì91 heart rate. High-altitude born and bred females of Quechua origins have comparatively enlarged lung volume for increased respiration. Aymara ceremony Blood profile comparisons show that among the Andeans, Aymaran highlanders are better adapted to highlands than the Quechuas. Among the Bolivian Aymara people, the resting ventilation and hypoxic ventilatory response were quite low (roughly 1.5 times lower), in contrast to those of the Tibetans. The intrapopulation genetic variation was relatively less among the Aymara people. Moreover, when compared to Tibetans, the blood haemoglobin level at high altitudes among Aymarans is notably higher, with an average of 19.2 g/dl for males and 17.8 g/dl for females. Among the different native highlander populations, the underlying physiological responses to adaptation are quite different. For example, among four quantitative features, such as are resting ventilation, hypoxic ventilatory response, oxygen saturation, and haemoglobin concentration, the levels of variations are significantly different between the Tibetans and the Aymaras. Ethiopians The peoples of the Ethiopian highlands also live at extremely high altitudes, around to . Highland Ethiopians exhibit elevated haemoglobin levels, like Andeans and lowlander peoples at high altitudes, but do not exhibit the Andeans‚Äô increase in oxygen content of haemoglobin. Among healthy individuals, the average haemoglobin concentrations are 15.9 and 15.0 g/dl for males and females respectively (which is lower than normal, almost similar to the Tibetans), and an average oxygen saturation of haemoglobin is 95.3% (which is higher than average, like the Andeans). Additionally, Ethiopian highlanders do not exhibit any significant change in blood circulation of the brain, which has been observed among the Peruvian highlanders (and attributed to their frequent altitude-related illnesses). Yet, similar to the Andeans and Tibetans, the Ethiopian highlanders are immune to the extreme dangers posed by high-altitude environment, and their pattern of adaptation is definitely unique from that of other highland peoples. Genetic basis The underlying molecular evolution of high-altitude adaptation has been explored and understood fairly recently. Depending on the geographical and environmental pressures, high-altitude adaptation involves different genetic patterns, some of which have evolved quite recently. For example, Tibetan adaptations became prevalent in the past 3,000 years, a rapid example of recent human evolution. At the turn of the 21st century, it was reported that the genetic make-up of the respiratory components of the Tibetan and the Ethiopian populations are significantly different.  Tibetans  Substantial evidence in Tibetan highlanders suggests that variation in haemoglobin and blood-oxygen levels are adaptive as Darwinian fitness. It has been documented that Tibetan women with a high likelihood of possessing one to two alleles for high blood-oxygen content (which is odd for normal women) had more surviving children; the higher the oxygen capacity, the lower the infant mortality. In 2010, for the first time, the genes responsible for the unique adaptive traits were identified following genome sequencing of 50 Tibetans and 40 Han Chinese from Beijing. Initially, the strongest signal of natural selection detected was a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia, called endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (EPAS1). It was found that one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at EPAS1 shows a 78% frequency difference between Tibetan and mainland Chinese samples, representing the fastest genetic change observed in any human gene to date. Hence, Tibetan adaptation to high altitude becomes the fastest process of phenotypically observable evolution in humans, which is estimated to occur a few thousand years ago, when the Tibetans split up from the mainland Chinese population. The time of genetic divergence has been variously estimated as 2,750 (original estimate), 4,725, 8,000, or 9,000 years ago. Mutations in EPAS1, at higher frequency in Tibetans than their Han neighbours, correlate with decreased haemoglobin concentrations among the Tibetans, which is the hallmark of their adaptation to hypoxia. Simultaneously, two genes, egl nine homolog 1 (EGLN1) (which inhibits haemoglobin production under high oxygen concentration) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), were also identified to be positively selected in relation to decreased haemoglobin nature in the Tibetans. Similarly, the Sherpas, known for their Himalayan hardiness, exhibit similar patterns in the EPAS1 gene, which further fortifies that the gene is under selection for adaptation to the high-altitude life of Tibetans. A study in 2014 indicates that the mutant EPAS1 gene could have been inherited from archaic hominins, the Denisovans. EPAS1 and EGLN1 are definitely the major genes for unique adaptive traits when compared with those of the Chinese and Japanese. Comparative genome analysis in 2014 revealed that the Tibetans inherited an equal mixture of genomes from the Nepalese-Sherpas and Hans, and they acquired the adaptive genes from the sherpa-lineage. Further, the population split was estimated to occur around 20,000 to 40,000 years ago, a range of which support archaeological, mitochondria DNA and Y chromosome evidence for an initial colonisation of the Tibetan plateau around 30,000 years ago. The genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) function in concert with another gene named hypoxia inducible factors (HIF), which in turn is a principal regulator of red blood cell production (erythropoiesis) in response to oxygen metabolism. The genes are associated not only with decreased haemoglobin levels, but also in regulating energy metabolism. EPAS1 is significantly associated with increased lactate concentration (the product of anaerobic glycolysis), and PPARA is correlated with decrease in the activity of fatty acid oxidation. EGLN1 codes for an enzyme, prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), involved in erythropoiesis. Among the Tibetans, mutation in EGLN1 (specifically at position 12, where cytosine is replaced with guanine; and at 380, where G is replaced with C) results in mutant PHD2 (aspartic acid at position 4 becomes glutamine, and cysteine at 127 becomes serine) and this mutation inhibits erythropoiesis. The mutation is estimated to occur about 8,000 years ago. Further, the Tibetans are enriched for genes in the disease class of human reproduction (such as genes from the DAZ, BPY2, CDY, and HLA-DQ and HLA-DR gene clusters) and biological process categories of response to DNA damage stimulus and DNA repair (such as RAD51, RAD52, and MRE11A), which are related to the adaptive traits of high infant birth weight and darker skin tone and are most likely due to recent local adaptation. Andeans The patterns of genetic adaptation among the Andeans are largely distinct from those of the Tibetan, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. However, EGLN1 appears to be the principal signature of evolution, as it shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. Even then, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations. Among the Andeans, there are no significant associations between EPAS1 or EGLN1 SNP genotypes and haemoglobin concentration, which has been the characteristic of the Tibetans. The whole genome sequences of 20 Andeans (half of them having chronic mountain sickness) revealed that two genes, SENP1 (an erythropoiesis regulator) and ANP32D (an oncogene) play vital roles in their weak adaptation to hypoxia. Ethiopians The adaptive mechanism of Ethiopian highlanders is quite different. This is probably because their migration to the highland was relatively early; for example, the Amhara have inhabited altitudes above for at least 5,000 years and altitudes around to for more than 70,000 years. Genomic analysis of two ethnic groups, Amhara and Oromo, revealed that gene variations associated with haemoglobin difference among Tibetans or other variants at the same gene location do not influence the adaptation in Ethiopians. Identification of specific genes further reveals that several candidate genes are involved in Ethiopians, including CBARA1, VAV3, ARNT2 and THRB. Two of these genes (THRB and ARNT2) are known to play a role in the HIF-1 pathway, a pathway implicated in previous work reported in Tibetan and Andean studies. This supports the concept that adaptation to high altitude arose independently among different highlanders as a result of convergent evolution.

She served in Sercey's squadron in the Indian Ocean, and in Saint-Domingue. She was captured by the Royal Navy at the end of the Blockade of Saint-Domingue when the island surrendered to the British. After her capture the Navy sailed her to Britain but never commissioned her, and finally sold her in 1810. French career Ordered as Vertu at the heigh of the Reign of Terror, the frigate was commissioned in Lorient. In May 1793, she sailed from Brest to √éle-d'Aix under Captain Montagni√®s-LaroqueFonds Marine, p.126 She took part in the Croisi√®re du Grand Hiver in December 1794, and escorted the 74-gun Redoutable after she broke her cables upon departure.Troude, vol.2, p.366 On 3 February, a violent gust of wind damaged Sercey's naval division, which was readying for a transit to Mauritius and a campaign in the Indian Ocean, damaging Cocarde;Troude, vol.3, p.16 Vertu, under Lhermite, was chosen to replace her. The division departed Rochefort on 4 March 1796, leaving behind Vertu which had yet to complete her preparation and rejoined the division Palma. On 15 May 1796 Forte, Vertu, Seine, and R√©g√©n√©r√©e were cruising between St Helena and the Cape of Good Hope hoping to capture British East Indiamen when they encountered the British whaler on her way to Walvis Bay. The French took off her crew, except for two seamen and a boy, and put Fortes fourth officer and 13-man prize crew aboard Lord Hawkesbury with orders to sail to √éle de France. On her way there one of the British seamen, who was at the helm, succeeded in running her aground on the east coast of Africa a little north of the Cape, wrecking her. There were no casualties, but the prize crew became British prisoners. The division arrived at Port-Louis on 18 June. There, Vertu took part in the various commerce raiding actions of the division, including the Action of 8 September 1796, where she sustained more damage than her fellows;Troude, vol.3, p.39 after the battle, she required a tow from R√©g√©n√©r√©e. In August 1797, she ferried troop from Mauritius to Batavia. With dwindling support from the colony of Mauritius, Sercey had to send R√©g√©n√©r√©e, under Willaumez,Troude, vol.3, p.130 and Vertu back to France.Troude, vol.3, p.55 Vertu departed the Indian Ocean theatre in September, under Captain Magon, sailing from Mauritius to Rochefort and escorting two merchantmen of the Spanish Royal Company of the Philippines to Europe.Fonds Marine, p.215 En route, the two frigates and two merchantmen stopped at √éles de Los to effect repair and gather water; they anchored at Tamara, Vertu disassembling her masts and yards to restore her rigging, while R√©g√©n√©r√©e sailed to the nearby island of Factori. On 24 April, the 32-gun , under Captain James Ballard, attacked Vertu; one hour into the battle, R√©g√©n√©r√©e, attracted by the cannonade, intervened and forced Pearl to flee. R√©g√©n√©r√©e unsuccessfully chased Pearl for 36 hours before abandoning the pursuit.On√©sime-Joachim Troude, claims the ship that chased Pearl was the 40-gun Vertu, while William James, in his book, \\"The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume II, 1797‚Äì1799\\" (p.219), states the 36-gun R√©g√©n√©r√©e was the ship in pursuit. William Clowes on p.510 of his book, \\"The Royal Navy, A History from the Earliest Times to 1900, Volume IV\\", says that both the frigates chased Pearl. Chase between HMS Brilliant and Vertu and R√©g√©n√©r√©e. On 10 May 1798, the ships departed for Europe. Arrived at Tenerife, the merchantmen were put under the care of the governor, as they considerably retarded the travel of the frigates. On 27 July, as the frigates prepared to pursue their journey, the 28-gun , under Henry Blackwood, sighted them. At 6, the French frigates put to sail and started firing on Brilliant; R√©g√©n√©r√©e was closing on her Brilliant when Vertu, which had sailed large, touched the wind; R√©g√©n√©r√©e imitated her manoeuvre, but lost her mizzen and bowsprit, allowing Brilliant to flee. Vertu gave chase, but could not overhaul Brilliant and returned to Tenerife. There, R√©g√©n√©r√©e replaced her rigging, and both frigates eventually arrived in Rochefort on 5 September. In 1803, Vertu, under Commander Gallier-Labrosse, was part of a naval division under Rear-Admiral Jacques Bedout.Fonds Marine, p.284 Under Commander Montalan,Fonds Marine, p.285Troude, vol.3, p.299 she sailed from Rochefort to Genoa, and from there, ferried troops to Saint-Domingue. At the Surrender of Cap Francais on 30 December, Vertu was in the harbour with Clorinde, under Pierre Lebozec. When Captain Barr√©, who commanded the naval forces at Saint-Domingue, informed them that their frigates would be surrendered to the British under the terms of the upcoming capitulation, Lebozec and Montalan attempted the run the British blockade. However the wind was so weak that day that the two frigates found themselves becalmed and threatened by the Haitian revolutionaries, and had to call the British for help. Commodore John Loring ordered Captain Bligh to rescue the French crew with the boats of the blockading ships. Eventually, the wind became more favourable and British prize crew managed to sail Vertu and Clorinde to the sea. British career and fate Vertu arrived at Plymouth on 14 August 1804. The Royal Navy decided not to commission Virtu and never prepared her for sea. Instead, she languished until December 1810 when she was broken up.Winfield (2008), p.175.

The NDF is made of units across various Syrian provinces, each of them consists of local volunteers willing to fight against rebels for various reasons. The NDF has generally positive interaction with the Syrian Democratic Forces. On 20 February 2018, NDF battalions volunteered to support the canton of Afrin against the Turkish-led operation against Afrin.  Formation  By the beginning of 2013, the Syrian government took steps to formalize and professionalize hundreds of Popular Committee militias under a new group dubbed the National Defence Forces.Will Fulton, Joseph Holliday, and Sam Wyer, Iranian Strategy in Syria , Institute for the Study of War, May 2013 The goal was to form an effective, locally based, highly motivated force out of pro-government militias. The NDF, in contrast with the Shabiha forces, received salaries and military equipment from the government. Since the formation of the NDF, Shabiha members have been incorporated into its structure. Young and unemployed men join the NDF, which some view as more attractive than the Syrian Army, considered by many of them to be infiltrated by rebels, overstretched and underfunded. A number of recruits say they joined the group because members of their families had been killed by rebel groups. In some Alawite villages almost every military-age male has joined the National Defence Force. Others, like the Druze people of Al-Suwayda Governorate, join to protect their land from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In late June 2015, the Syrian government began arming citizens of this governorate against ISIL, who were harassing the local population with abductions, executions, and plundering. The locals became a large and powerful NDF contingent in the governorate, including the prominent Golan Regiment. The creation of the NDF was personally overseen by Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Suleimani. Syrian security officials stated that they received assistance from Iran and Hezbollah, who both \\"played a key role in the formalization of the NDF along the model of the Iranian 'Basij' militia\\". The NDF recruits received training in urban guerilla warfare from Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Hezbollah instructors at facilities inside Syria, Lebanon, and Iran, with this partnership remaining in place as of April 2015. Iran has contributed to gathering together existing neighborhood militias into a functioning hierarchy and provided them with better equipment and training. The United States government has also stated that Iran is helping build the group on the model of its own Basij militia, and that some members are being sent for training in Iran.  Role The force acts in an infantry role, directly fighting against rebels on the ground and running counter-insurgency operations in coordination with the Syrian Army, which provides them with logistical and artillery support. The force was reported to be 60,000-strong as of June 2013 and grew to 100,000 by August. The NDF is composed mainly of members of the Alawite and Shia sects of Islam and are loyal to Syrian Government. Units mostly operate in their local areas, although members can also choose to take part in army operations. Others have claimed that the NDF does most of the fighting because NDF members, as locals, have a strong knowledge of the region. Struggling with reliability and issues with defections, officers of the Syrian Army increasingly prefer the part-time volunteer reserves of the NDF, who they regard as more motivated and loyal, over regular army conscripts to conduct infantry operations. An officer in Homs, who asked not to be identified, said the army was increasingly playing a logistical and directive role, while NDF fighters act as combatants on the ground.  Organization and training  According to a report, as of February 2015 the National Defense Forces are organized under provincial commanders, and loosely overseen by a national coordinator who is reported to be Brigadier-General Ghassan Nassour, although later sources report the name of Hawash Mohammed. Local branches are deemed to act with autonomy and to be not cohesive on the provincial level, although there is little uniformity. Provincial branches seem to be commanded by a senior officer each. Since January 2013, the NDF has a 500-strong women's wing called \\"Lionesses of National Defence\\", which operates checkpoints in the Homs area. The women are trained to use Kalashnikovs, heavy machine guns and grenades, and taught to storm and control checkpoints. The period of training can vary from 2 weeks to a month depending on whether an individual is being trained for basic combat, sniping, or intelligence.

It runs on Autodesk Systems certified hardware, as Flame Premium, Flame and Smoke Advanced. It is part of the Flame Premium package. History Development Lustre was originally a 5D product called Colossus, developed by Colorfront. After the demise of 5D in 2002, Autodesk acquired the license to distribute the Lustre software, and later acquired Colorfront entirely. Lustre originated as a plugin for Autodesk's Flame product under the name \\"Colorstar\\" to emulate film type color grading using printer lights controls. It was then developed as a standalone software. It was introduced under the Colossus name in private demonstrations at IBC show in Amsterdam in 2001. Alpha and beta testing were held at Eclair Laboratoires in Paris. During the trials, Colossus was running on the Windows XP operating system, but the same code base was also used on the IRIX operating system. The original creators of Lustre are Mark and Aron Jaszberenyi, Gyula Priskin, Tamas Perlaki, Gabor Forgacs, Ferenc Bechtold. Lustre is now integrated in the Flame Premium package. Version history *Lustre 1.0 was released on Windows XP. It had a \\"Discreet\\" skin to have the buttons look like Flame and Smoke. The hotkeys were also changed from Colossus to match neither Flame nor Smoke. *Lustre 2.5 had the first implementation of wiretap, the way to access Flame and Smoke libraries directly into the application browser. It was read only. *Lustre 2.7 was the first iteration to see the Linux release and the integration of Incinerator, a cluster of render nodes to process pictures. *Lustre 2008 was a Windows only release with the addition of an editing timeline. *Lustre 2009 saw Windows and Linux releases back in sync. *Lustre 2012 ext1 saw the introduction of the Source grading workflow, allowing to see and grade the original source clips in a Flame/Smoke timeline and render them back as individual segments with all effects kept back into a Flame/Smoke timeline. Overview The Lustre architecture uses CPU and GPU optimizations to obtain realtime playback on high resolution files, as required for digital cinema color grading. The original control surface was the Tangent Devices CP100. Later Autodesk developed the Autodesk Control Surface manufactured by Tangent Devices. Since version 2012 Lustre also supports the Tangent Device Element, which is used by many grading applications on the market.

From 2002 to 2013 she wrote regularly on Italian wine for Decanter and from 2004 for The World of Fine Wine. She was also Contributing Editor for The Wine News from 2003 to 2009. Career Kerin O‚ÄôKeefe holds a degree in English literature from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and also studied English and American literature for a year at the University of East Anglia. O'Keefe has a keen interest in fine Italian wine made from autochthonous grape varieties. She has been acknowledged to be \\"one of the great wine commentators on Italy\\" and \\"a critic in the best sense of the word, not shy with her opinions, which she offers without polemics or bluster.\\" She was named Honorary Knight by the Ordine dei Cavalieri del Tartufo e dei Vini di Alba on April 7, 2017.  Books  Her first book was published in Italian by Luigi Veronelli in 2004: Franco Biondi Santi. Il gentleman del Brunello. She authored the English edition of the book in 2005, Franco Biondi Santi. The Gentleman of Brunello, a recipient of a Gourmand Wine Books Award. She also won the Premio Consorzio Brunello di Montalcino in 2008 for her cover article \\"Brunello de-con-structed\\" in the Oct-Nov 2007 issue of The Wine News. Brunello di Montalcino - Understanding and Appreciating One of Italy's Greatest Wines, (University of California Press, 2012), gave Montalcino and its wines the in-depth treatment they deserved. Her latest book, Barolo and Barbaresco - The King and Queen of Italian Wine, (University of California Press, 2014), filled a gap in the wine literature by helping consumers understand the differences among the various sub-zones of Barolo and Barbaresco. Contentions In The Times Literary Supplement Tim Crane put her in the Clive Coates/Michael Broadbent camp of wine critics, rather than in the Robert Parker camp of \\"loud and fruity descriptions\\". Her article \\"Rebels without a cause? The demise of Super-Tuscans\\" was discussed by Eric Asimov in The New York Times and spurred a lively debate on the merits of Super-Tuscans. The Brunellopoli scandal was not a surprise for O'Keefe, as she had been questioning Brunellos which were suspiciously dark and without the typical aromas of pure Sangiovese wines for years. O'Keefe wrote in 2003 that many of 1997 Brunellos she had tasted: \\"were so jammy it was hard to believe they were Brunello\\", in 2006 that: \\"illicit blending with other grapes, to make luminous ruby-garnet color unnaturally darker, is staunchly denied on all official fronts\\" and in 2007 that: \\"Doubts can only remain in the face of some of the darker, impenetrable Brunellos sometimes seen\\". O'Keefe opposes the view held by many about the so-called American Palate, or the preference for highly oaked, sweet and powerful wines. She maintains it is a crass stereotype to believe that an entire nation has a uniform taste with respect to wine. She argued instead that US wine drinkers have shown a growing appetite for more balanced and drinkable wines. Bibliography * Franco Biondi Santi.

Career  After secondary school education in T√¢rgu Mure»ô (), he attended the Teacher Training Institute in Cluj-Napoca (, ) (1900). He then studied at the Natural History Teachers' College in Budapest, graduating from the Faculty of Geography in 1904. He spent the next seven years teaching in the gymnasium of Ke≈æmarok (), then in 1911 moved back to T√¢rgu Mure»ô. Meanwhile, he had begun to publish botanical papers, and in 1922 he was invited by the Romanian botanist Alexandru Borza to be curator of the Cluj-Napoca Botanical Garden, with a remit to expand the herbarium. Between 1940 and 1944 together with Rezs≈ë So√≥ he published his 9-volume Kolozsv√°r √©s k√∂rny√©k√©nek fl√≥r√°ja (Flora of Cluj and its environment). In 1942 he nominally retired, but did not stop his work.

Life and career Roselle Paulino Nava- Tan is a multi-platinum female singer in the Philippines and one of the most in-demand divas during the 90s era. She is tagged as the Philippines' Sentimental Diva and the former supreme songbird of ABS-CBN. Before Sarah Geronimo, it was her. She was formerly dubbed as the 90s Philippine Pop Queen. She started her career as a part of ABS-CBN's defunct youth-oriented show Ang TV (1992-1997) together with Jolina Magdangal, Claudine Barretto, Antoinette Taus, etc. She was also a regular host and performer of ASAP, the Philippines longest variety show, from 1995-2004. She is the singer behind the hits like Bakit Nga Ba Mahal Kita, Maniniwala Ba Ako, Dahil Mahal Na Mahal Kita, Laging Ikaw Parin, Ikaw Pala, Mahal Mo Ba'y Di Na Ako, Huwag Ka Nang Babalik, etc. In 1995, she was hailed as the Best Female Singer of the Year for the song You by Awit Awards. The same year, her very first signature hit, Bakit Nga Ba Mahal Kita (Why Do I Love You?), became the number one charted song in the Philippines and stayed in the radio charts for 8 months. It became the themesong of many Filipinos who went through heart breaks and got lost in love. In 1997, however her commercialised success of Dahil Mahal Na Mahal Kita, her carrier single from her 3rd album (Roselle: On Higher Ground), emerged immediate success and even spanned a film with the same name and even in album registry. To date, Dahil Mahal Na Mahal Kita was also covered four times by different artists: Rachelle Ann Go for The Gulong Ng Palad (2006) Soundtrack and Zsa Zsa Padilla's rendition for the Afternoon Soap theme Magkano Ang Iyong Dangal? in 2010, in 2013 by Vice Ganda for the soundtrack of the Primetime series Huwag Ka Lang Mawawala, and in 2018, Jonalyn Viray (aka Jona), for the teleserye Asintado. In 2000, she revived the Barry Manilow song \\"Somewhere Down The Road\\" for the Blockbuster Film \\"Minsan Minahal Kita\\" which also was included in the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack; and in 2002, her comeback platinum hit with Star Records \\"Huwag Ka Nang Magbabalik for the film Ngayong Nandito Ka and Jologs. In 2002, Roselle was chosen as the interpreter for the song, Free, composed by Gino Torres. The demo version was recorded by Carol Banawa. But the composer chose Roselle to do the final and live version. It became as one of the finalists of ABS-CBN's JAM: Himig Handog sa Makabagong Kabataan. It also became the themesong of ABS-CBN's summer station ID in the same year. Roselle Nava's last album with Star Records (ABS-CBN's recording outfit) All About Love achieved the Platinum Status but was never awarded to her. She moved to Viva Entertainment Agency and signed up for several projects. VIVA did not commercialise her artistry as her recent albums got no awards. The poor sales performance of her albums affected her singing career. In 2010, Bakit Nga Ba Mahal Kita was also re-recorded by Laarni Lozada for the Afternoon Drama \\"Alyna\\"; and Kakai Bautista, Philippines' Dental Diva, as her carrier single for her debut album under Star Music in 2017. Roselle Nava - Tan is now working as the number one councilor of the 1st District of Para√±aque City, Metro Manila, Philippines.  Vocal profile  Roselle's voice can be classified as soprano as her style is very similar with Regine Velasquez's singing prowess. She suffered from a throat virus which affected the brilliance of her voice. She was able to cope up through healing sessions and support of her fans.  Recent trends  In 2009, she was part of the talked-about successful concert entitled \\"Divas of the 90s\\", produced by VIVA Entertainment Company. Her co-performers were Geneva Cruz, Jessa Zaragoza, and Rachel Alejandro. On February 13, 2016, she also had a successful concert with other OPM icons entitled LOVE THROWBACK held in PICC (Philippine International Convention Center). On February 4, 2018, Roselle was given a tribute by ASAP as one of the OPM gems in the country. She sang her signature hits with ABS- CBN's homegrown talents. The tribute showed how she started as a prime diva of ABS-CBN and what's her life now. Roselle was awarded a plaque of recognition with her contribution to OPM. Personal life She married Allen Ford Tan on January 18, 2010 at the Manila Cathedral in Manila. They have two sons (Rafa and Ram).

It is a small molecule inhibitor compound that blocks the activity of the enzyme UDP- N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase, an epimerase enzyme that is called 2-epimerase for short. Mechanism of action 2-Epimerase converts UDP-N- acetyl-D-glucosamine to UDP-N-acetyl-D-mannosamine. Bacterial 2-epimerase differs from its human counterpart in that the bacterial molecule has an allosteric site. For enzymatic activity, the allosteric site needs to be occupied by the substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine; this is the first enzyme described in which the substrate is present in both the catalytic and allosteric sites. Because epimerox targets the allosteric site of the bacterial 2-epimerase, low human toxicity is expected since the human 2-epimerase does not have this site. Although epimerox was originally developed specifically to target Bacillus anthracis, the bacterium that causes anthrax, it was found that it is also effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and many other Gram-positive bacteria. No bacteria could be identified that were resistant to the compound (resistance frequency of <10‚àí11). Thus, epimerox is an antibiotic with low resistance potential. Therefore, 2-epimerase is a new antibiotic target to which resistance is a rare event. 2-Epimerase was discovered as a target because it was one of the enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway for synthesizing an essential neutral polysaccharide in the cell wall of B. anthracis (Glu:Gal- NAc:Man-NAc at a 3:2:1 ratio). This polysaccharide is only found in B. anthracis and is the receptor for a bacteriophage lysin enzyme called PlyG, which is produced by the Œ≥-bacteriophage to release its progeny from infected B. anthracis. For bacteriophage to survive they need to replicate inside a bacterial cell and release their progeny phage when they are assembled using their lysin. Since lysins from bacteriophage that infect Gram-positive bacteria must bind to a cell wall receptor to function, the enzymes have evolved over a billion years to identify substrate receptors in the bacterial cell wall that the bacteria cannot change easily. These substrates are either part of the peptidoglycan or sugars linked to it. Deletion of both 2-epimerase genes in B. anthracis is lethal to the bacterium.  Chemistry  Epimerox is the name of two chemically closely related compounds that were found to block 2-epimerase and act as antibiotics by the described mechanism. Both are thiohydantoin derivatives of the amino acid phenylalanine. They differ in the residue on the thiohydantoin's carbon atom, which is (E)-5-(3,4- _dichloro_ phenyl) _furan_ -2-ylmethylene in one compound and (E)-5-(3- _bromo_ phenyl) _thiophene_ -2-ylmethylene in the other. Synthesis The last step of the epimerox synthesis, a Knoevenagel condensation The substances are prepared via a Knoevenagel condensation of a thiohydantoin‚Äìphenylalanine imine with different aldehydes, which yields a mixture of E and Z isomers. The active compounds are the E forms.

It is characterised by its probability density function, within the support of the distribution, being proportional to the reciprocal of the variable. The reciprocal distribution is an example of an inverse distribution, and the reciprocal (inverse) of a random variable with a reciprocal distribution itself has a reciprocal distribution. Definition The probability density function (pdf) of the reciprocal distribution is : f( x; a,b ) = \\\\frac{ 1 }{ x [ \\\\log_e( b ) - \\\\log_e( a ) ]} \\\\quad \\\\text{ for } a \\\\le x \\\\le b \\\\text{ and } a > 0. Here, a and b are the parameters of the distribution, which are the lower and upper bounds of the support, and \\\\log_e is the natural log function (the logarithm to base e). The cumulative distribution function is : F( x ; a,b) = \\\\frac{ \\\\log_e( x ) - \\\\log_e( a ) }{ \\\\log_e( b ) - \\\\log_e( a ) } \\\\quad \\\\text{ for } a \\\\le x \\\\le b.  Characterization   Relationship to Log- Uniform  Histogram and log-histogram of random deviates from the reciprocal distribution A positive random variable X is log-uniformally distributed if the logarithm of X is uniform distributed, : \\\\ln(X) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal U(\\\\ln(a), \\\\ln(b)). This relationship is true regardless of the base of the logarithmic or exponential function. If \\\\log_a(Y) is uniform distributed, then so is \\\\log_b(Y), for any two positive numbers a,b eq 1. Likewise, if e^X is log- uniform distributed, then so is a^X, where 0 < a eq 1. Applications The reciprocal distribution is of considerable importance in numerical analysis as a computer‚Äôs arithmetic operations transform mantissas with initial arbitrary distributions to the reciprocal distribution as a limiting distribution.Hamming R.

Oratio de laudibus legum, 1499 Biography Born in Bologna in 1419 as the son of Bernardo Garzoni, a physician and rhetoric. Already in his youth, Garzoni's main interest was rhetorics, when he may have been instructed by his father Bernardo Garzoni and by Giovanni Lamola, and met humanists like Leonardo Bruni. When his father became one of the physicians of pope Nicholas V (between 1447 and 1455), Giovanni went along with him to Rome. The earliest extant texts by Barzoni date from this period, including a 300 folio long codex, mainly consisting of the emended Tractatus by Petrus Hispanus; and some poems and other minor works. Here as well, he met other humanists like Theodorus Gaza. He was a student of Guarino da Verona, with whom he studied Juvenal, and of Lorenzo Valla, who was his teacher for four years. In 1455, he worked for cardinal Domenico Capranica, for whom he travelled to Naples. Part of this work was done together with Jacopo Piccolomini-Ammannati, a fellow humanist and later cardinal. In or after 1458, he returned to Bologna, where he became a public speaker, providing orations for official events, something he would later on also do at the university. He also started working as a private teacher of rhetoric, having students from countries and regions like Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia. His most famous pupils were the historian Leandro Alberti, who stayed with Garzoni from when he was ten until he was fourteen, and Girolamo Savonarola, who was a student of Garzoni in 1476 and 1477, when he was a novice in Bologna. Later, he became friends with humanists like Antonio Urceo and Julius Pomponius Laetus. He received his degree in medicine in 1466, and remained a professor of medicine at the University of Bologna for the rest of his life. Works Garzoni wrote 36 lives of saints (or vitae), including those of Agatha, Blasius, Catherina Alex., Cecilia, Christina, Cosmas and Damian, Eustachius, Felix and Felix, George, Gervasius and Protasius, Hippolytus, the apostle Johannes, Laurentius, Lucia, Margarita, some Mauritanian martyrs, Nereus and Achilleus, Primus and Felicianus, Proculus, Sebastian, Vitus and Hippolytus, Simon of Trent, the martyr Peter, Petronius, Theodorus, Symphorianus, and Christopher. Some of his letters have been collected in ten books of epistolae familiares. Other works that survive include histories (mainly Bolognese history), dialogues, treatises, medical texts, and a large number of funerary and other orations, on a wide range of subjects, from religion to military matters, including a pornographic story, Heliogalbalus.

Laura Mandell and Rita Raley state: Manuscript miscellanies are important in the Middle Ages, and are the sources for most surviving shorter medieval vernacular poetry. Medieval miscellanies often include completely different types of text, mixing poetry with legal documents, recipes, music, medical and devotional literature and other types of text, and in medieval contexts a mixture of types of text is often taken as a necessary condition for describing a manuscript as a miscellany. They may have been written as a collection, or represent manuscripts of different origins that were later bound together for convenience. In the early modern period miscellanies remained significant in a more restricted literary context, both in manuscript and printed forms, mainly as a vehicle for collections of shorter pieces of poetry, but also other works. Their numbers increased until their peak of importance in the 18th century, when over 1000 English poetry miscellanies were published,\\"About\\", Digital Miscellanies Index before the rise of anthologies in the early 19th century. The printed miscellany gradually morphed into the format of the regularly published magazine, and many early magazines used the word in their titles.  Manuscript and printed miscellanies before the 18th century  Miniature of Noah's Ark landing on the Mountains of Ararat (fol. 521a), from the 13th century North French Hebrew Miscellany The broadest distinction is between manuscript and printed miscellanies. Manuscript miscellanies were carefully compiled by hand, but also circulated, consumed, and sometimes added to in this organic state ‚Äì they were a prominent feature of 16th and early 17th century literary culture. Printed miscellanies, which evolved in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were compiled by editors and published by booksellers in order to make a profit. While manuscript miscellanies were produced by a small coterie of writers, and so were constructed around their own personal tastes, printed miscellanies were increasingly aimed towards a popular audience, and bear the marks of commercially driven, money making, opportunistic endeavours.Richard Beadle, Colin Burrow (eds.), Manuscript Miscellanies, c. 1450-1700 (London: British Library, 2011).Adam Smyth, ‚Äò‚ÄòProfit and Delight‚Äô‚Äô: Printed Miscellanies in England, 1640‚Äì1682 (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2004). Multi-authored collections are known to exist in many forms ‚Äì such as newspapers, magazines, or journals ‚Äì and the act of commonplacing, of transcribing useful extracts and quotations from multiple sources is also well recorded. However, the formal production of literary miscellanies came into its established form in the 16th and 17th centuries, and reached a highpoint in the 18th century. Although literary miscellanies would often contain critical essays and extracts of prose or drama, their main focus was popular verse, often including songs. At this time poetry was still a dominant literary form, for both low and high literature, and its variety and accessibility further suited it to miscellaneous publication.J.

Medieval miscellanies A patterned page from the Trevelyon Miscellany of 1608 Most medieval miscellanies include some religious texts, and many consist of nothing else. A few examples are given here to illustrate the range of material typically found. The Theological miscellany (British Library, MS Additional 43460) was made in late 8th century Italy with 202 folios of patristic writings in Latin. The 9th-century Irish Book of Armagh is also mostly in Latin but includes some of the earliest surviving Old Irish writing, as well as several texts on Saint Patrick, significant sections of the New Testament, and a 4th-century saint's Life. The Nowell Codex (BL Cotton Vitellius A. xv, ignoring a later volume bound in with it) is an Old English manuscript of about 1000 to 1010. It is famous for the only text of Beowulf but also includes a life of Saint Christopher, Wonders of the East (a description of various far-off lands and their fantastic inhabitants), a translation of a Letter of Alexander to Aristotle, and the poem Judith based on the Old Testament Book of Judith.British Library page on the Nowell Codex. It is one of the four Old English Poetic Codices from which the bulk of surviving Old English poetry comes, all of which can be classed as miscellanies. The Lacnunga is a 10th or 11th century miscellany in Old English, Latin and Old Irish, with health-related texts taking a wide range of approaches, from herbal medicine and other medical procedures, to prayers and charms. The lavishly illuminated late 13th century North French Hebrew Miscellany contains mostly biblical and liturgical texts, but also legal material, over 200 poems, and calendars.British Library catalogue online, North French Miscellany The large 9th-century Chinese text Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang, contains various Chinese and foreign legends and hearsay, reports on natural phenomena, short anecdotes, and tales of the wondrous and mundane, as well as notes on such topics as medicinal herbs and tattoos. The Trevelyon Miscellany of 1608, an oversized illustrated manuscript of 594 pages, depicts a wide range of subjects including herbal cures, biblical stories, a list of the mayors of London, proverbs, calendars, and embroidery patterns.Exhibited at the Folger Shakespeare Library, in 2004  Verse miscellanies  \\"My hope is yow for to obtaine\\". A love poem in a distinctive hand from The Devonshire Manuscript, 57r. Verse miscellanies are collections of poems or poetic extracts that vary in authorship, genre, and subject matter. The earlier tradition of manuscript verse continued to be produced in the 16th century and onwards, and many of these early examples are preserved in national, state, and university libraries, as well as in private collections. The Devonshire Manuscript is a verse miscellany that was produced in the 1530s and early 1540s, and contains a range of works, from original pieces and fragments to translations and medieval verse. Compiled by three eminent women, it is one of the first examples of men and women collaborating on a literary work.Southall, Raymond. ‚ÄúThe Devonshire Manuscript Collection of Early Tudor Poetry, 1532‚Äì41,‚Äù Review of English Studies, n.s. 15 (1964): 142-50. A drawing illustrating the medieval poem \\"Reinbroun\\" from the Auchinleck Manuscript. Also prominent is the Arundel Harington manuscript, containing the writings of Sir Thomas Wyatt, Queen Elizabeth, and Sir Philip Sidney. Into the 17th century, the two Dalhousie Manuscripts are also of literary significance, as they contain the largest sustained contemporary collection of John Donne‚Äôs verse.Joshua Eckhardt, \\"Verse Miscellanies, Manuscript\\" in Garrett A. Sullivan (ed.) The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature, 3 vols. (Oxford: Blackwell, 2012), III, 1002-1006, pp. 1002-1003. Although fewer medieval verse miscellanies have been preserved, the Auchinleck Manuscript survives as a good example: it was produced in London in the 1330s and offers a rare snapshot of pre-Chaucerian Middle English poetry.David Burnley and Alison Wiggins (eds.),The Auchinleck Manuscript, National Library of Scotland (5 July 2003). The Importance of the Auchinleck Manuscript. Retrieved April 18, 2013. However, most surviving manuscript verse miscellanies are from the 17th century: Printed verse miscellanies arose in the latter half of the 16th century, during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558‚Äì1603). One of the most influential English Renaissance verse miscellanies was Richard Tottel‚Äôs Songes and Sonettes, now better known as Tottel's Miscellany. First printed in 1557, it ran into nine further editions before 1587; it was not then printed again until the 18th century.Matthew Zarnowiecki, \\"Verse Miscellanies, Printed\\" in Garrett A. Sullivan (ed.) The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature, 3 vols. (Oxford: Blackwell, 2012), III, 1006-1010, pp. 1006-07. Although few new miscellanies emerged during the insurrectionary years of James I and Charles I (1603‚Äì1649), there was a resurgence of interest during the Restoration period and 18th century, and the vast majority of printed verse miscellanies originate from this latter period.Adam Smyth, \\"An Online Index of Poetry in Printed Miscellanies, 1640-1682.\\" Early Modern Literary Studies 8.1 (May, 2002) 5.1-9. Retrieved April 18, 2013. The poetry in these miscellanies varied widely in genre, form, and subject, and would frequently include: love lyrics, pastorals, odes, ballads, songs, sonnets, satires, hymns, fables, panegyrics, parodies, epistles, elegies, epitaphs, and epigrams, as well as translations into English and prologues and epilogues from plays. The practice of attributing poems in miscellanies was equally varied: sometimes editors would carefully identify authors, but most often the miscellaneous form would allow them to disregard conventions of authorship. Often authors were indicated by a set of initials, a partial name, or by reference to a previous poem \\"by the same hand\\"; equally often there were anonymous or pseudonymous attributions, as well as misattributions to other authors ‚Äì or even made-up or deceased persons. Within a miscellany, editors and booksellers would often exercise considerable freedom in reproducing, altering, and extracting texts. Due to early copyright laws, lesser-known authors would regularly play no part in the printing process, receive no remuneration or royalties, and their works could be freely redistributed (and sometimes even pirated) once in the public domain.Manushag N. Powell, Performing Authorship in Eighteenth-Century English Periodicals (Lewisburg, Pa.: Bucknell University Press, 2012), p. 18.  Development in the 18th century  Frontispiece and title page to The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany,The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany which claimed to include \\"the Lucubrations of the Polite Part of the World, written upon walls, in Bog- Houses\\" such as the one at left of the tavern shown Throughout the 18th century, the miscellany was the customary mode through which popular verse and occasional poetry would be printed, circulated, and consumed. Michael F. Suarez, one of the leading authorities on miscellanies, states: Including songbooks, the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature lists almost 5000 verse miscellanies which were printed between 1701 and 1800.George Watson (ed.), The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, 5 vols. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1971), II, cols. 341‚Äì429. Due to the sheer number and variety of miscellanies printed in the 18th century, there are few generalizations that can be made about them. From the polite (Allan Ramsay‚Äôs The Tea-Table Miscellany, 1724‚Äì27)Google Books The Tea-Table Miscellany to the partly obscene (The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany, 1731‚Äì33)Gutenburg The Merry Thought: or, The Glass- Window and Bog-house Miscellany the central purpose behind nearly all printed verse miscellanies was the reader‚Äôs entertainment. However, they were also marketed with practical purposes in mind: as educative moral guides (Miscellanies, Moral and Instructive, in Prose and Verse, 1787),Google Books Miscellanies, Moral and Instructive, in Prose and Verse as repositories of useful information (A Miscellany of Ingenious Thoughts and Reflections in Verse and Prose, 1721‚Äì30), as elocutionary aids (William Enfield‚Äôs The Speaker, 1774‚Äì1820),Google Books The Speaker and as guides for poetical composition (Edward Bysshe's The Art of English Poetry, 1702‚Äì62).Digital Miscellanies Index, The Art of English Poetry Some miscellanies were even aimed at children, as A Little Pretty Pocket-Book (1744) demonstrates. It consists of rhymes and morals for each letter of the alphabet.  Range of titles and audiences  In a competitive market the title of miscellanies was increasingly important. Without a specific selling-point, more generic complications would use catch-all titles as a tactic to familiarise themselves with a wide range of audiences and to appeal to a breadth of tastes. Titles could evoke the ornamental (The Bouquet: or Blossoms of Fancy, 1796), the medicinal (The Merry Companion: or, A Cure for the Spleen, 1730), the festive or feast (A Banquet of the Muses: or The Miscellany of Miscellanies, 1746), the curious (A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies, 1751‚Äì82),Digital Miscellanies Index, A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies and the curatorial (The Foundling Hospital for Wit, 1743‚Äì64).Digital Miscellanies Index, The Foundling Hospital for Wit  Variety and popularity  Despite these categorizations, miscellanies attempted to appeal to a wide audience by containing a variety of material for different tastes. Although an editor might orient the miscellany towards an intended audience, by nature of the variety of verse a much wider readership would have been possible. One-off, occasional miscellanies might prove popular and warrant further volumes or editions, such as political pamphlets (Poems on Affairs of State, 1689-1705),Google Books Poems on Affairs of State resort-based works (Tunbrigalia: or the Tunbridge Miscellany, 1712‚Äì40), local productions (The Yorkshire Garland, 1788),Google Books The Yorkshire Garland and courtly, coterie or collegiate collections (Thomas Warton‚Äôs The Oxford Sausage: or select poetical pieces written by the most celebrated wits of the University of Oxford, 1764‚Äì80).Google Books The Oxford Sausage  Print trade and piracy  Often the commercial success of a miscellany would stimulate the publication of similarly titled, parasitic, and even entirely pirated works. Dublin booksellers, outside the jurisdiction of the Statute of Anne (1710) which had established copyright in England, could legally reproduce any popular miscellany that they thought would make a profit. Robert Dodsley‚Äôs hugely popular Collection of Poems by Several Hands (1748)Google Books Collection of Poems by Several Hands was copied entirely by Dublin booksellers in 1751, though it also underwent other, more minor piracies in the English literary market ‚Äì such as unauthorized continuations, supplements, or companion texts attempting to exploit the reputation of the original.Michael F. Suarez, ‚ÄòThe Production and Consumption of the Eighteenth-Century Poetic Miscellany‚Äô in Isabel Rivers (ed.) Books and Their Readers in Eighteenth- century England: New Essays (London: Leicester University Press, 2001), 217-251, pp. 227-233.  The decline of verse miscellanies  The famous opening lines of A Tale of Two Cities in the periodical All the Year Round  Changing tastes and technology  Although poetry maintained cultural pre- eminence for most of the 18th century, it was at the same time retreating before the advance of prose, and particularly the rise of the novel, as the new dominant form of literary expression in the West.David Perkins, A History of Modern Poetry from the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode (London: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1976), p. 12. The decline of poetry as the most widely printed format is also partly technological. Lee Erickson argues: Miscellanies however remained popular throughout the 19th century, especially what came to be known as the ‚Äúweekly news miscellany, which typically appeared at the weekend and featured not only a summary of the week‚Äôs intelligence but also a variety of instructive and entertaining matter‚Äù, in other words what we call today a magazine, but poetry was no longer privileged among these publications.Graham Law and Robert L. Patten, ‚ÄòThe Serial Revolution‚Äô in David McKitterick (ed.) The Cambridge History of the Book (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), Volume 6: 1830-1914, 144-171, p. 155. Verse miscellanies slowly died out in the Victorian era, as literary miscellanies made possible the serial publication of novels, such as William Harrison Ainsworth‚Äôs Jack Sheppard (1839-40) or Charles Dickens‚Äô A Tale of Two Cities (1859) which was published in 31 weekly instalments in his literary periodical All the Year Round. There were few, if any, miscellanies devoted to poetry. Instead, verse would be the minority of content, in order to provide variety from the extensive prose: Title page of Alexander Chalmers' Works of the English Poets, volume 18.  Succession of the anthology  In the wake of collections such as Robert Anderson‚Äôs Works of the British Poets (thirteen vols., 1792-95) and Alexander Chalmers‚Äô Works of the English Poets (twenty-one vols., 1810), anthologies were increasingly adopted for the publication of assorted poems. Barbara M. Benedict argues: Printing technologies and the rise of the novel played an important role in reshaping the nature of miscellanies, as did changing ideas about the native literary canon. Attempts to construct a credible canon of English verse had been ongoing since the early 18th century, and with its success the place of poetry was determined by the advent of authoritative anthologies which claimed to represent the very best of the English poetic tradition.Jonathan Brody Kramnick, Making the English Canon: Print-Capitalism and the Cultural Past, 1700‚Äì1770 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 1-14.  Significance and recognition  In contrast to anthologies, whose aim is to give a canonical history of literature, miscellanies tend to reflect the dynamic literary culture of the time in which they were produced. As Michael F. Suarez states: There are modifications to this definition, such as the argument that miscellanies could contain elements that might be considered anthological (the inclusion of classical literary pieces for example) or could be republished years later when their original contents had matured in literary value.Jennifer Batt, ‚ÄòEighteenth-Century Verse Miscellanies‚Äô in Literature Compass 9/6 (2012), 394-405, p. 395. Suarez also notes that eighteenth-century miscellanies often contained ‚Äúextracts from a variety of single-author publications‚Äù and, furthermore, that ‚Äúmany miscellanies appropriated select pieces from earlier poetry collections, thus forming what were essentially anthologies of miscellanies.‚ÄùSuarez, ‚ÄòPoetic Miscellany‚Äô, p. 225.  The literary marketplace  It is generally accepted that miscellanies offer insight into the popular taste of the moment, of what people read and how they read it; yet they also provide information about the aesthetic, social and economic concerns underlying the production and consumption of literature. Miscellanies were assembled, marketed and sold with a contemporary reading audience in mind, and reveal a dynamic between the taste which they played a part in shaping, and the preoccupations of the editors who complied and the publishers who sold them. Indeed, the range of price and format reveals the extent to which poetry was packaged and sold for different readerships. As Jennifer Batt argues: Miscellanies frequently placed emphasis on variety, novelty and fashionability, providing their readers with a range of different pieces by various writers, but also keeping them abreast of the newest developments in the literary market. They are a prime demonstration of early marketing and advertising techniques in literature. The title page and distinctive ornament of Percy's Reliques.  Contemporary importance and influence  Miscellanies were an influential literary form at the time. From the beginning of the 18th century, verse miscellanies were gathering together a selection of poetic works by different authors, past and present, and so played a part in the development of the concept of the English canon. These literary miscellanies might be sold as unique collections, arising from the combinations of writers in a small literary circle; or their function could attempt to be more national and historical, by representing the finest works of British poets to date. The multiple editions of the Dryden-Tonson Miscellany Poems (1684-1708)Digital Miscellanies Index, Miscellany Poems and the Swift-Pope Miscellanies (1727‚Äì32),Google Books Miscellanies as well as The Muses Library (1737)Google BooksThe Muses Library and The British Muse (1738),Google Books The British Muse were from early on attempting to construct a notion of a national literary heritage.Kramnick, Making the English Canon, pp. 20-21. The revival of interest in English balladry is also largely due to miscellanies, most famously Thomas Percy‚Äôs Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (1765).Google Books Reliques of Ancient English Poetry Miscellanies also played a part in the development of other literary forms, particularly the novel. Since so many collections included prose extracts alongside poetry, often from eighteenth-century novels such as Laurence Sterne‚Äôs Tristram Shandy (1759), it is arguable they aided the popularisation of novels. Leah Price‚Äôs The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel (2000), in particular, discusses the relationship between miscellanies and prose fiction in the latter half of the 18th century.  Submerged voices and marginal writing  Because of the variety and novelty they emphasise, as well as the anonymity of authorship they could offer, miscellanies often enabled the inclusion and so expression of more submerged voices, such as those of women, and more marginal forms of writing, such as the comic, the curious, and the crude. As Dustin Griffin has noted: Many miscellanies contained exclusively the writing of women, most famously Poems by Eminent Ladies (1755)Google Books Poems by Eminent Ladies ‚Äì a collection of verse by 18 women poets including Aphra Behn, Elizabeth Carter, Mary Leapor, Anne Finch, Katherine Philips, Margaret Cavendish, Mary Monck, Lady Mary Chudleigh, and Mary Barber ‚Äì and recently critics have brought to light the ways in which such women made a key contribution to the miscellany culture of the 18th century.Chantal Lavoie, Collecting Women: Poetry and Lives 1700‚Äì1780 (Lewisburg, Pa.: Bucknell University Press, 2009).Margaret Ezell, Writing Women‚Äôs Literary History (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993).

Miscellanies also presented themselves as performing an important cultural or curatorial role, by preserving unbound sheets, fragments and ephemera which otherwise would have been lost ‚Äì and thus offering a unique insight into the vibrant literary life of the 18th century. A prime example of such curiosity-shop publications is The fugitive miscellany: a collection of fugitive pieces in prose and verse (1774),Internet Archive The fugitive miscellany.

Late twentieth-century criticism has drawn attention to the cultural and literary importance of these non- canonical, lesser-known and ephemeral kinds of popular verse ‚Äì such as the recent discovery of a poem spuriously attributed to John Milton, ‚ÄúAn Extempore upon a Faggot‚Äù.The Bodliean Library, 'Archive of irreverent miscellanies put online'. 23 September 2010. Retrieved April 18, 2013. As the most prolific source of anonymous or pseudonymous publication, miscellanies provide insight into the unconventional history of English literature. Roger Lonsdale notes in his influential anthology, The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse (1984): ‚ÄúOne of the most interesting poets [from this period] is the ubiquitous ‚ÄòAnonymous‚Äô, whose voice almost never registers in conventional literary history‚Äù. Crucially, he suggests that we would know more about ‚Äúthe landscape of eighteenth-century poetry‚Äù if more attention was paid to ‚Äúthe innumerable miscellanies by several hands‚Äù.Roger Lonsdale (ed.) The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), pp. xxxix, xxv.  Literary criticism and research projects  It is now widely accepted by literary critics that paying attention to forms of access to literature, and to the reception history of individual works and authors, is an important part of the history of literary culture. In this context, the miscellany has grown rapidly in interest in eighteenth-century studies. As Jennifer Batt states: In light of such developments there have arisen projects attempting to make the vast number and array of verse miscellanies more accessible to modern researchers and readers, most prominently through the process of online digitization. In 2012 Verse Miscellanies Online was launched, which offers a searchable critical edition of seven printed verse miscellanies published in the 16th and early 17th centuries. While some projects focus on creating online editions of the most significant verse miscellanies, others have attempted to arrange a corpus of miscellanies produced in set periods, such as Scriptorium: Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts Online (2006-2009), a digital archive of manuscript miscellanies and commonplace books from c. 1450-1720. The largest undertaking by far has been The Digital Miscellanies Index, an ongoing project funded by the Leverhulme Trust. The Index seeks to create a freely available online database of the 1000-plus verse miscellanies published in the 18th century, based on a comprehensive bibliography compiled by Michael F.

Friedkin, Coppola and Bogdanovich were all coming off hit films and Bludhorn wanted to work with them. Friedkin says Bludhorn made the deal with the directors without informing Paramount's Frank Yablans, who was strongly opposed to the idea of the company. Nonetheless in 1972 Yablans announced the Directors Company would make three films, each under $3 million ‚Äì Paper Moon (Bogdanovich), The Conversation (Coppola) and The Bunker Hill Boys (Friedkin); he also said the company aimed to make 12 pictures in all and would possibly move into television.

It was followed by The Conversation, which was a major critical success. It performed moderately well at the box office, but was not as financially successful as Paper Moon. Daisy Miller flopped at the box office and Friedkin did not end up making any movies for the company. Friedkin later said he was proud to be associated with Paper Moon but did not like The Conversation, thinking it was a rip-off of Blow Up. He also says he was strongly opposed to Bogdanovich making Daisy Miller, thinking it was not commercial enough, and felt Yablans encouraged the director to make it in part to end the company. The financial failure of Daisy Miller and internal fighting over The Conversation ended the Directors Company.

Incident The Markomannia (3335 BRT, 1890) was a steamer of the Hamburg America Line on the West Indies-Hamburg route, commanded by Captain Nansen. On 2 September 1902 she was stopped off the Haitian port of Cap-Ha√Øtien by the Haitian gunboat Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot and searched for contraband. The Cr√™te √† Pierrot was under the control of Ant√©nor Firmin's faction, which was rebelling against the provisional government of president Boissond Canal. The commander of the Pierrot was rebel admiral Hammerton Killick. Killick assumed that the Markommania was carrying weapons and supplies to government forces. She was thus searched by a boarding party and, despite protests from Nansen and the German consul in Cap-Ha√Øtien, transferred the weapons and supplies on board to the Pierrot. The Markomannia was then allowed to continue her voyage, delayed but undamaged.  Battle between SMS Panther and Crete-√†-Pierrot  The Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot with her stern on fire during the battle German residents had already been harmed in Haiti's civil war and so after the incident the German minister-resident in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, Francsen, immediately called in a German warship. The Kaiserliche Marine sent the SMS Panther to find the rebel ship. Admiral Killick evacuated his crew and blew up the aft magazines of Cr√™te-√†- Pierrot, which was by then under fire from the Panther commanded by Richard Eckermann. Killick and four members of the crew went down with the ship. There were concerns about how the United States would view the action in the context of the Monroe Doctrine. But despite legal advice describing the sinking as \\"illegal and excessive\\", the US State Department endorsed the action. The New York Times declared that \\"Germany was quite within her rights in doing a little housecleaning on her own account\\".

Mount Ollivier is named after him. Early life Ollivier was born in 1851 in Hammersmith, Middlesex, England. He was the eighth son of John and Elizabeth Ollivier (n√©e Morton). The family with 10 children came to New Zealand on the John Taylor; the ship left London on 10 July 1853 and arrived in Lyttelton on 18 October. He received his education at Christ's College from 1862 to 1865; he was pupil number 179. Sport Cricket Ollivier was a right-hand batsman. In February 1867, he became a representative cricketer at age 15, when he played for Canterbury against Otago at Hagley Oval; the first cricket game ever that was played on that ground. He was also playing when Canterbury first met Auckland in 1873; the year that the Auckland team was founded. He played against England in February 1877, and against Australia in January 1878. Injury forced Ollivier to retire from the game in 1883. He became a trainer, administrator and selector of players. In 1882, Edward Cephas John Stevens and Ollivier initiated the purchase of a parcel of land which became Lancaster Park; this was to overcome the problem of spectators not paying a fee at Hagley Oval. In 1893, he selected the New Zealand team for the match against New South Wales. Mountaineering Mueller Hut and the summit of Mount Ollivier Ollivier was known for his mountaineering exploits and Mount Ollivier is named for him. Other sports Ollivier was a noted sports person in rugby and athletics, especially sprinting. He was a successful chess player, was a founding member of the Canterbury Chess Club in 1877, and was dominion champion in 1888/89. Professional career Ollivier was an accountant by profession. His first employment was with D. Macpherson and Co. (which became Matheson's Agency). His next position was with J. T. Ford and Co. He was in partnership with Trevor Grierson before becoming self-employed. Community involvement Ollivier was a member of many organisations, and he was often on the committee. He was president of the Old Boys' Association of Christ's College from 1895 until his death. He was deeply involved with the administration of cricket. Family, death and commemoration Ollivier married Agnes Thomson (born ca 1849), a daughter of the politician William Thomson, on 20 September 1876 at St Mark's Church in Opawa. They had three children: * Keith Morton Ollivier (2 August 1880 ‚Äì 12 September 1951) * Cecil Claude Morton Ollivier (2 July 1878 ‚Äì 27 July 1935) * Muriel Morton Ollivier (19 April 1883 ‚Äì 20 June 1971) Ollivier was unwell for several months before his death. He went to Castle Hill in the high country for a change of air, but returned even more ill. He died at the early age of 46 on 21 October 1897 at home in the Christchurch suburb of Opawa. He was buried at Woolston Cemetery. It was Frederick Wilding's proposal that resulted in the Canterbury Cricket Association erecting the gravestone for Ollivier; the inscription reads \\"Erected by the Cricketers of New Zealand\\". He was buried on a Saturday (23 October), and out of respect to him, all cricket matches in Canterbury got cancelled on that day. Mount Ollivier near Aoraki / Mount Cook is named after Arthur Ollivier. In 1939, the peak was Edmund Hillary's first major climb. After Hillary's death in 2008, there was a proposal to rename the peak Mount Hillary as a memorial, a suggestion opposed by Arthur Ollivier's family.

He was a committed Nazi and had an influential role in the Nazification of the German P.E.N. from 1933 onwards. He used the pseudonyms Peter Cornelissen and Wilhelm Wolfslast. Life Busch was the son of Alfred Busch, a bank manager, and his wife Eugenie Schick. After completing his secondary education, he spent two semesters at a university. His younger brother, Harald Busch (1904-1983) was an art historian who was in charge of the Hamburg Art Gallery from 1934 to 1935. During the Second World War both brothers served in a propaganda company in which they played down the role of the Wehrmacht on behalf of the Propaganda Ministry and praised the camaraderie of army life. In 1912 Busch joined the Imperial Navy as an officer candidate. During the First World War he took part in the Battle of Jutland as a sub- lieutenant on the battleship SMS Oldenburg. From spring 1917 to summer 1918 he was an artillery officer on the Light Cruiser SMS Regensburg holding the rank of second lieutenant. During this time, from 27 June to 14 July 1918 he also saw service in Flanders. He then saw service on the minelaying light cruiser SMS Bremse, experiencing the 1918 Mutiny and the end of the war. He was awarded the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class and the Friedrich-August Cross. In 1919 he married Ada von dem Knesebeck, Baroness of Bittersdorf. His first son, Ulf was born in 1920, the first of three children. Busch served in the navy of the Weimar Republic until 1928, holding the rank of Korvettenkapit√§n when he left. After the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939 he was recalled to service, and on 4 September 1939 he experienced the first British air attack. Subsequently he was returned to the reserve. Literary and political activities Right from the start of the Weimar Republic Busch was active in spreading propaganda. He was influential in the creation of the myth that the German navy had won the Battle of Jutland. This can also be seen in his article \\"SMS Regensburg in the last sortie of the fleet( 23‚Äì25 April 1918 )\\" which was published in Eberhart von Mante's anthology of propaganda entitled \\"Undefeated at Sea: Thirty Monographs from the War at Sea\\" which was published by the nationalistic, antidemocratic, racist publisher J.F. Lehmann. For a number of his books, Busch used the pseudonym Peter Cornelissen .Michael Epkenhans, J√∂rg Hillmann, Frank N√§gler: Skagerrakschlacht: Vorgeschichte, Ereignis, Verarbeitung. (im Auftrag des Milit√§rgeschichtlichen Forschungsamtes). Oldenbourg Verlag, 2009, S. 318 His book \\"Heut geht es an Bord...!\\" (Today we go on board) was published by the explicitly racist Arman publishing house in 1934. From 1933 onwards, Busch became the most widely read Nazi propaganda author on naval matters. The publishers of his works were all committed Nazis. His involvement in the Destruction of the German PEN At the General Assembly of the German PEN Club on 23 April 1933, Busch became a member, having been proposed in a list prepared by the Militant League for German Culture. By this time the German PEN had been forced into conformity with Nazi principles as its new secretary Johann von Leers commented.http://www.duerr.org/dbfu.pdf accessed on 15/12/2017. In May 1933, as a member of the German delegation, together with Edgar von Schmidt-Pauli and Hans Martin Elster, Busch persuaded the International PEN Congress not to pass a motion against the Nazi book burnings and the persecution of the Jews in Germany. He reported on this in an extensive letter, a copy of which was sent to Joseph Goebbels.Joseph Wulf: Literatur und Dichtung im Dritten Reich: eine Dokumentation, Ullstein 1989, S. 80‚Äì82. When, despite the opposition of the German Delegation, the author Ernst Toller spoke out against the mistreatment and persecution of German authors in Nazi Germany, Busch and his delegation walked out of the Congress. Shortly after this, the German PEN Club withdrew from the international movement and in 1934 it was re-established as the Union of National Writers. Busch was secretary of this organisation .Gerd Simon (Hrsg.): Die philologisch-historischen Wissenschaften in den Planspielen des SD. Verlag der Gesellschaft f√ºr interdisziplin√§re Forschung T√ºbingen (GIFT) First published on 31 January 1998, with minor revision on 1 September 2010 S. 256 online This successful destruction of the German PEN meant that all the authors living in German were forced to leave the international PEN Club. Only Germans living in exile were able to retain their membership. As a Nazi Propagandist Magazine Die Kriegsmarine 14/1940 following the German defeat of France in June 1940 After the Nazis seized power, Busch was made the chief editor of the propaganda magazine \\"The Reichsmarine, Magazine for the Importance of the Sea and Seafaring\\" which was continued after 1934 as \\"The Kriegsmarine - Germany at Sea\\". When the Reichsmarine was renamed the Kriegsmarine on 1 June 1935, the magazine was renamed \\"Kriegsmarine - German Naval Magazine\\" Initially the magazine was published with the support of the High Command of the Navy, while it was later published directly by the High Command. Busch remained the chief editor till the Magazine ended in 1944. In other publications Busch also identified with Nazi propaganda positions. In conjunction with Dr Gerhardt Ramlow(1904-1951), author of propaganda and of literature intended for young people, Busch wrote a book called \\"A History of German Sea Warfare\\"(1940), which starts with the era of the early Germanic peoples. The book argues that the navy was an early centre of Nazi thinking: \\"It is not by chance that National Socialism, its attitudes and ideology found early support among the officers, NCOs and men of the Reichsmarine in numbers which were hardly to be expected by the opponents of the new thinking. While the armed forces had previously grown up to be totally apolitical and uneducated in political thinking, and considered it to be wrong if they should concern themselves with political matters, this changed during the F√ºhrer's relentless struggle for the soul of the Nation.\\" Nach: L√©on Poliakov/Josef Wulf: Das Dritte Reich und seine Diener. Berlin, Wien 1983 (Nachdruck der Erstausgabe von 1953) S. 447. At the start of February 1933 a state funeral for Hans Maikowski, a member of the SA who died of a gunshot wound, took place in Berlin. In the broadcast of the occasion for propaganda purposes, the Nazis claimed that Maikowski was a second Horst Wessel. Among the other speakers, as well as Joseph Goebbels, was Fritz Otto Busch, who contributed a hymn of praise to the German forces. Beschreibung der erhaltenen Rundfunkreportage ¬ªDRA-Info Audio¬´ S. 36. \\"The Vikings\\", a book for young people (1934) In her dissertation, Ingeborg R√∂mer, the student of literature investigates the way in which numerous books for young people written during the Nazi period portray early nordic history. Ingeborg R√∂mer: Ahnen und Helden? Altnordische Literatur in Schul- und Jugendb√ºchern der nationalsozialistischen Zeit. Frankfurt a. M. 2010. One of these is \\"The Vikings\\" written by Busch and published by the Franz Schneider publishing house in Leipzig. For Busch, Vikings are north-Germanic people , bold seafarers, and our blood relatives.R√∂mer 2010, P. 79. The book consists of two main sections: factual descriptions of the construction of Viking ships, and the adventurously portrayed retelling of excerpts from the Vinland sagas. R√∂mer indicates several typical examples of political exploitation and contrivance. Erik the Red and his sons are described as having exemplary attributes (R√∂mer). It is conspicuous that in one single section Busch repeatedly uses the word \\"F√ºhrer\\" for Erik the Red,a word which is not normally used in maritime language, or if so only in the context of the word \\"Schiffsf√ºhrer\\" (ship's master).R√∂mer 2010, P. 140. In addition a dramatic battle with a storm by the crew of the Viking boat, which strengthens this motive has no precedence in the original.R√∂mer 2010, P. 141. Many books for the young dealing with this topic, including the one by Busch, emphasise the discovery of America by the Vikings. In doing so, Busch combines a free description of genuine historical events with the present day. For example, he integrates the flights to America by \\"our fliers, Gronau and Balbo. These had found the same way to the new part of the world as the Vikings, which is illustrated on a map.R√∂mer 2010, S. 40. Busch also builds further \\"bridges\\" (R√∂mer) between the alleged forefathers and the present Nazi state. Thus according to Busch a \\"German\\" called \\"Tyriker\\" was a member of Erik's crew. However \\"German\\" as a nationality was still unheard of in the year 1000. Also the designation in the text \\"su√∞rma√∞r\\" only literally means \\"South man\\" or \\"man from the South\\".R√∂mer 2010, S. 141. It is similar when it comes to other details as well, thus the invocation of a god is modern and not historical. In the book, Erik confirms his intention to sail to the west with Leif calling out: \\"By Thor, and if I wanted to!\\". This acclamation is structured as would be expected from Christian belief, especially of a Catholic nature, and not as a pagan would do. R√∂mer 2010 S. 200. Further details from the Vinland Saga are taken over by Busch uncritically, such as the alleged discovery of wine and grain there.R√∂mer 2010, S. 79. Four booklets from the Thule Collection served as sources for Busch.R√∂mer 2010, S. 79. The Vikings was reprinted several times. In 1938 copies 19-20,000 were printed, followed by 26-35,000 in 1941.R√∂mer 2010, S. 79. Bush continued to publish on the topic after 1945. In 1966 Sponholz in Hannover published Viking Sails off America, the Saga of Gudrid and Freydis.  The best-seller: Narvik, the Heroic Fight of German Destroyers (1940)  In 1940, following the German victory in the Battle of Narvik the Bertelsmann publishing house released this lavishly turned-out book written by Busch. It was a work of \\"war reporting which toed the party line\\", it had an introduction by Grand Admiral Erich Raeder and was recommended by the OKW in the Books of the Armed Forces.Saul Friedl√§nder, Norbert Frei, Trutz Rendtorff, Reinhard Wittmann: Bertelsmann im Dritten Reich. C. Bertelsmann, M√ºnchen 2002, . S. 435. The book was celebrated in the specialist press and after a year 200,000 copies had been sold. In 1941 Busch earned 242,084.47 RM from his writing activities, and in the following years he earned approximately 100,000 RM a year. In doing so, at that time he was among the highest-earning German authors. The Bertelsmann publishing house earned a clear total profit of 650,000 RM from the book.Adam 2010. It reached place 17 in a list of Best sellers of the Third Reich which was published in 2010.NS-Bestseller. Die Lieblingsb√ºcher der Deutschen im Dritten Reich In: Die Welt vom 19. August 2010, aufgerufen am 28. Mai 2012. Kommentierte Liste aufgrund der Studie: Christian Adam: Lesen unter Hitler. Autoren, Bestseller, Leser im Dritten Reich. Galiani, Berlin. Digitalisierte Ausgabe von \\"Narvik\\" 1940 According to Christian Adam, if you ignore the moral aspect, the Narvik book is generally well crafted, although at many places it was \\"quickly cobbled together\\". In a mixture of reporting, fictional elements and documents he describes a part of Operation Weser√ºbung, that is the attack on Norway and the capture of the iron-ore port of Narvik. The war described in the book which is written from the perspective of a field commander is \\"clean\\". Death and suffering are blanked out. Alleged atrocities carried out on German survivors by the Royal Navy are emphasised. The book was a propagandistic success which achieved its desired effect in encouraging young men to go to war. \\"If he shows his characteristic arrogance, the Englishman has to be hit hard in the face. The sons of the island do not react to anything else\\".(Busch)Adam 2010. As a result of a part of the text in the first chapter the book fell foul of several competing censors: the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, the F√ºhrer's official representative for the supervision of the overall spiritual and ideological training and education of the Nazi party, Alfred Rosenberg, and the Navy.Saul Friedl√§nder, Norbert Frei, Trutz Rendtorff, Reinhard Wittmann: Bertelsmann im Dritten Reich. C. Bertelsmann, M√ºnchen 2002, . S. 437. Despite meeting its desired effect as propaganda, Busch was criticised by the SS poet Kurt Eggers because he was not writing from his own experience. He argued that when the time came it was only from the circle of the \\"Narvik travellers\\" that the \\"prophets and singers\\" would be found who could write the conclusive heroic epic of this journey to the north. The book which Busch had written had only immediate value. The book also caused offence because of a description of a German church service which, however, Busch concluded in a contemporary way: \\"We have paid tribute to our fallen comrades who bravely and proudly went to death for our F√ºhrer, our race, and our Fatherland...Long live the F√ºhrer.\\"(Busch)Adam 2010. In autumn 1941 the book was withdrawn from the market, after the publisher had already sold 615,000 copies.c.f. Dietrich M√ºller: Buchbesprechung im politischen Kontext des Nationalsozialismus. Entwicklungslinien im Rezensionswesen in Deutschland vor und nach 1933, Diss. Universit√§t Mainz 2007, S. 180 f. As the book had been favourably budgeted, it provided Bertelsmann with its biggest net profit for a single book during the Third Reich. The publishing of this book was also very lucrative for the author. By to 1945 Busch had written about seventy further works, including the autobiographical novel Cruiser in the Red Tide which he wrote under the pseudonym Peter Cornelissen. In this novel he portrayed the final phase of the First World War and the Revolution of 1918 from the perspective of a young naval officer on board the minelaying light cruiser SMS Bremse. Busch wrote factual books, novels and books for the young, often containing propaganda for the navy. In addition he was also editor of the magazines Imperial German Navy, German Naval Newspaper and Raise the Anchor!. In addition he was also one of the authors who contributed to the series Wartime Library for German Youth.  After 1945  In view of his involvement with National Socialism many of the books written by Busch landed in the list of literature to be withdrawn in the Soviet occupation zone or the GDR between 1939 and 1953. http://www.polunbi.de/bibliothek/1946-nslit-m.html, http://www.polunbi.de/bibliothek/1946-nslit-n.html, http://www.polunbi.de/bibliothek/1953-nslit-b.html After a pause, in 1950 Busch started to write books about sea journeys and the navy. In this respect he also wrote books for the young which were published by Franz Schneider in Munich. He also translated works from English. Using his pseudonym Wilhelm Wolfslast numerous naval history books were published by Moewig in Munich, including two booklets for the war comic series: Soldiers' Stories from Round the World. In the 1950s, together with Otto Mielke he was an author for two story paper series SOS - Fate of German Ships and Anchor Stories: Seafaring around the World. The greater part of the publications of both series was republished from 1978 onwards by Pabel publishers under the title The Landser presents: Ship's fates on the Seas of the World. The German Maritime Search and Rescue Service also published - and frequently republished - a series of booklets Catastrophes at Sea, for which Busch also provided texts. In his work as an author, he worked together with the maritime illustrator Walter Zeeden, who illustrated numerous books, together with the two series by the Moewig publishers. Busch died on 5 July 1971 in Limpsfield in Surrey, where he is buried. From the 1950s he obviously lived for a long time in Viersen; Limpsfield is known to be his final home.

Constable. p.399 History Robert Bruce granted the barony of Plean, or Plane, to John d‚ÄôErth soon after 1314. The castle was probably built by Lord Somerville, who acquired the lands of Plean in 1449, through marriage. An adjoining \\"manor house\\" was built in about 1528. In 1643 James Somervell, 8th Lord of Plane, sold the barony and lands to meet debts. It passed to the Nicholsons and the Elphinstones, but both the tower and the manor fell into disrepair. During the 1745 rebellion the Jacobite troops used the property. Sir David Menzies restored the buildings in 1908, but by the 1930s they were again no longer in use.

The album is credited to Almond and Michael Cashmore, of Current 93 and Nature and Organisation, with both given equal billing. The album was released by Strike Force Entertainment, part of Cherry Red Records, on 30 May 2011. Background Marc Almond first worked with Michael Cashmore when Almond contributed guest vocals to the Current 93 album Black Ships Ate the Sky. They next collaborated as Marc Almond & Michael Cashmore for the EP Gabriel and the Lunatic Lover in 2008 and continued to occasionally work together until they completed Feasting with Panthers. The album is entirely composed of poetry set to music and was produced with both artists separate at all times with music and vocals being sent back and forth. The Guardian describes the album as \\"a sumptuous piano-driven collaboration with Michael Cashmore, featuring songs derived from the poetry of Jean Cocteau, G√©rard de Nerval and Jean Genet\\", which Almond in the same article calls \\"decadent poetry translated by Jeremy Reed\\". The album was released as a gatefold digipak which included a 14-page booklet. Critical reception Feasting with Panthers received mixed reviews from critics.

In December 1917, the 2nd Congress of Rumcherod elected the Bolshevik Executive Committee and adopted a decision on transferring all power to the Soviets. On January 17, 1918 the conference of city factory committees elected the city's military revolutionary committee (the Committee of 15th) which consisted of the Bolsheviks Vladimir Yudovsky (chair), P.Starostin, G.Achkanov, Makar Chizhikov and others. The next day, a conference of representatives of 49 enterprises, soldiers and sailors took place in Odessa, expressing support for the establishment of the Soviet regime. The uprising started on January 27, 1918 and involved formations of local Red Guards, Okhtyrka Hussars Regiment, 40th and 49th reserve regiments, and other units. The insurgents were supported by the battleships \\"Sinop\\", \\"Rhostislav\\" and the cruiser \\"Almaz\\" aboard which was the headquarters of the uprising and military tribunal. The Black Sea Fleet ships along with the armored train \\"Zaamurets\\" were part of the approaching expeditionary force of Muravyov which joined the uprising later. On the first day Red Guards secured the headquarters of the Odessa Military District, rail station, post office, banks and other institutions. The next day on January 28, 1918, the local haidamakas freed the district's headquarters, rail station and post office from the Bolsheviks, but on January 29, the Red Guards and revolutionary soldiers and sailors were able to defeat forces of the Ukrainian People's Republic which completely surrendered on January 30, after which the Soviet regime was established in the city. But after signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty all Bolshevik forces were driven out by 13 March 1918 by the combined armed forces of the Austro-Hungarian Army, providing support to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

There are two species currently recognised in Cylindrococcus, C. casuarinae (the type species) and C. spiniferus, which can be easily differentiated by the appearance of the galls induced by adult females. The galls of C. casuarinae are long, narrow and relatively smooth whereas those of C. spiniferus are broad and have prominent bracts.

Adult females of C. casuarinae have large, bulbous membranous lobes where the mid and hind legs would be, whereas C. spiniferus has only sclerotised patches in these areas. Adult females of the two species can also be separated by the semicircular plates with robust spines near the anus of C. spiniferus that are not present in C. casuarinae.

Adult males have very long thin external genitalia that, it has been argued, allows them to mate with adult females that are deep within galls. Males induce their own galls (7‚Äì17 mm long), which are long and thin bract-like galls on the tip on branchlets.

Biography She was born on May 28, 1985 in Sacramento, California. She graduated from El Camino Fundamental High School in 2003. When Andres was 23 years old, in 2008, she was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma. She was in her senior year at the California College of the Arts where she was studying fashion. While she was in treatment, she wrote about her experience in a blog called Cancer Is Not Funny. For Andres, writing about what she was going through and using humor helped her cope with the experience. Her experiences as a young adult with cancer were chronicled in season two of the MTV series, World of Jenks, and in the comic book, Terminally Illin, published by Last Gasp. As a fashion designer in New York City, Andres worked with Betsey Johnson and Rachel Antonoff. She lived with Melissa Carroll, a painter who also had Ewing's sarcoma. The pair met during cancer treatment. On March 31, 2014, Carroll passed away after a three-year battle with the disease. In 2014, Andres exhibited art at Jenn Singer Gallery in Manhattan, New York City that related to her fight with cancer. \\"Chemosynthesis\\" (2014) dealt with the grief of losing her health and accepting her cancer. Two years later, \\"Viaticum\\" (2016) also dealt with this acceptance. The work was inspired by a spiritual pilgrimage, in which Andres met Joao de Deus, a faith healer, in Brazil. Through the exhibition, Andres explored the connection between art and birth, as well as the physical and spiritual realms. The works in \\"Viaticum\\" are self-portrait photographs printed on silk. Andres died on November 21, 2016 in Manhattan, New York City after an eight-year battle with cancer. She was thirty-one years old. Andres is buried in Sacramento, California.

He won the English Triple Crown on Isinglass in 1892, as well as individual Classics on Donovan (1889 Derby) (for which he was a last-minute booking), Siffleuse (1893 1,000 Guineas) and St. Frusquin (1896 2,000 Guineas). On Isinglass, he also won the 1894 Eclipse and 1895 Ascot Gold Cup and he had another top class win on Desmond in Newmarket's July Stakes in 1898. Life Loates was regarded as the best of a family of four jockey brothers which included fellow Classic- winner, Sam Loates. He was apprenticed to Joseph Cannon at Newmarket and was known as \\"a good lightweight, with very good hands\\". For Donovan's Derby win, he weighed just 6 1/2 stone. Loates once narrowly escaped death when falling in the Liverpool Cup on Lord Derby's race mare Birch Rod. He was also badly injured in a fall at Manchester and later married the nurse who tended him. A low point for Loates came in 1891 when his licence to ride was withdrawn by the Jockey Club for his involvement in betting, but he was reinstated the following year. He died in Brighton, England in 1910, leaving $1,250,000 in property. It was believed he had amassed this phenomenal sum ($31.8 million in 2013 prices) because his later employer was the financier Leopold de Rothschild who looked after his investments.

She spent many years researching enslaved African culture with a special emphasis on the material artifacts of enslaved African women, while earning degrees in history and folklore at Howard University and a PhD at Indiana University. Fry was a Bunting Institute Fellow from 1988-1989 at Radcliffe College, Cambridge, MA, and retired Professor Emerita from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2000. Fry was a frequent lecturer at educational institutions in the United States and abroad. She curated a dozen exhibitions that have been hosted at major institutions. Among them are the Eva and Morris Feld Gallery of the Museum of American Folk Art at Lincoln Square in New York City, the Renwick Gallery and the Anacostia Museum of Art of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., Huntsville Museum of Art, Huntsville, Alabama, Afro-American Museum of Art, Dallas, Texas, and the Art Gallery at the University of Maryland. Fry is famous for the following two seminal folklore works: * Stitched from the Soul: Slave Quilts from the Ante-Bellum South. ** This richly illustrated book offers a glimpse into the lives and creativity of African American quilters during the era of slavery. Originally published in 1989, Stitched from the Soul was the first book to examine the history of quilting in the enslaved community and to place slave-made quilts into historical and cultural context. It remains a beautiful and moving tribute to an African American tradition. Undertaking a national search to locate slave-crafted textiles, Gladys-Marie Fry uncovered a treasure trove of pieces. The 123 color and black and white photographs featured here highlight many of the finest and most interesting examples of the quilts, woven coverlets, counterpanes, rag rugs, and crocheted artifacts attributed to slave women and men. In a new preface, Fry reflects on the inspiration behind her original research‚Äîthe desire to learn more about her enslaved great-great-grandmother, a skilled seamstress‚Äîand on the deep and often emotional chords the book has struck among readers bonded by an interest in African American artistry. * Night Riders in Black Folk History ** During and after the days of slavery in the United States, one way in which slave owners, overseers, and other whites sought to control the black population was to encourage and exploit a fear of the supernatural. By planting rumors of evil spirits, haunted places, body-snatchers, and \\"night doctors--even by masquerading as ghosts themselves--they discouraged the unauthorized movement of blacks, particularly at night, by making them afraid of meeting otherworldly beings. Blacks out after dark also risked encounters with \\"patterollers\\" (mounted surveillance patrols) or, following the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan. Whatever their guise, all of these \\"night riders\\" had one purpose: to manipulate blacks through terror and intimidation. First published in 1975, this book explores the gruesome figure of the night rider in black folk history. Gladys-Marie Fry skillfully draws on oral history sources to show that, quite apart from its veracity, such lore became an important facet of the lived experience of blacks in America. This classic work continues to be a rich source for students and teachers of folklore, African American history, and slavery and post-emancipation studies. She died on November 7, 2015 at the age of 84 from a heart attack. Contributions to American quilt history In 1976, Fry published landmark research about American quilt maker Harriet Powers‚Äô life in Missing Pieces: Georgia Folk Art 1770-1976, an exhibit catalog. This was the first full-scale investigation about the life and Bible- themed quilts of Powers (an African American slave, folk artist and quilt maker from rural Georgia, whose surviving works are on display at the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts.) For her book Stitched from the Soul, she mailed 600 letters to museums in the early 1980s looking for \\"black folk survivals.\\" Her search identified almost 150 previously unknown slave-made quilts (identified on museum accession cards of the time as \\"made by unknown darkey.\\") Fry was one of the early researchers to document African American men quilting. She curated the 1998 exhibit \\"Man Made: African-American Men and Quilting Traditions,\\" which included quilts by enslaved Africans, Paul Buford, Raymond Dobard, David Driskell and eleven others.

Retrieved: 25MAY13  Creation  President Roosevelt declared at the Casablanca Conference in early 1943 that the goal of the war was the unconditional surrender of Germany. To that end, and during the following many months, the leading Allied powers planned and gave form to the task of dividing Germany, and how to govern her after the war. The London Protocol of September 1944, established the division of Germany into zones of occupation, and the city of Berlin into sectors. Additionally, Berlin was to be governed by an Allied Komendatura (sic). The occupied sectors of Berlin The Soviets fought for and captured Berlin by the beginning of May 1945, and set up camp not only their own sector, but took control over the whole of Greater Berlin. The U.S. and British entered Berlin later, on July 1, and July 24, respectively. By that time the Soviets had plundered and pillaged the western sectors of Berlin. They had removed vital industrial infrastructure on a wholesale scale, and had taken most of what was left in the city in terms of agriculture and livestock.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 44-45 The U.S. commandant, Major General Floyd L. Parks, tasked his divisional G5 and later deputy, Colonel Frank L. Howley,Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, page 45 to prepare a general plan for the basis of an Allied Kommandatura, based on a Russian proposal.Berlin Command, Brig.

General Frank Howley, 1950, page 51 By this time the French had also obtained their own sector in the north of Berlin, carved out of the British sector, but were not invited to participate in the initial meetings.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, page 52 In any case, Howley's plan was in preparation for the first high-level post-war meeting between the Allies regarding Berlin, and outlined conditions for quadripartite governance. General Lucius D. Clay, Eisenhower's deputy, Robert Murphy, Eisenhower's political adviser, and others flew in to Berlin for the meeting. Berlin's fate was sealed, however, prior to the July 7 meeting. Clay and others let Parks know, in no uncertain terms, that Berlin was to be governed unanimously in all instances. Howley's plan was carefully worked out and allowed governance on a divided basis when unanimity could not be obtained, but Clay was following orders from Washington. General Clay and the British, including Gen. Sir Ronald Weeks and Sir William Strang, were caught flat-footed at the meeting, and subsequently deferred to the Soviets on so many issues. Their chief representatives were Marshals Zhukov and Sokolovsky, both of whom had great experience in moving a situation to their advantage. Howley indicated that the signed \\"Komandatura agreement put the Soviets in the saddle.\\"Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 52-59 The next meeting on July 11, 1945, represented the first actual meeting of the Allied Kommandatura, where the four-power Council of Commandants began governing the city.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, page 61 One major, initial task remained: where to meet. This was left to the Kommandatura deputies to resolve. The Soviets offered one possible location for Kommandatura headquarters, but it was far removed in a distant Berlin suburb. The British offered several damaged buildings and a hotel in their sector. Howley initially offered a building on Lake Wannsee, but others objected that they would never get any work done in such a beautiful setting. Finally he suggested another site not far distant from the American military headquarters, which was accepted by all on the condition that it was made serviceable.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 62-63  Operation  In theory the Kommandatura would decide issues requiring attention and governance, formulate a response, and issue formal orders to the Lord Mayor and the Berlin Magistrat.A Four Year Report, Office of Military Government U.S. Sector, Berlin, 01JUL45-01SEP49, page 24. Retrieved: 25MAY13 At the July 11, 1945, meeting, the commandants signed the first of their nearly 1,300 such quadripartite orders. That particular order truly put the Soviets in the saddle as it reinforced all preexisting Russian regulations and ordinances put in place throughout the city before the western allies arrived: Structure of the Kommandatura Thereafter, whenever the Western Allies protested against a specific Russian action, they responded that they were simply abiding some statute or regulation that was already in place before the Americans, British, or French arrived. Anytime the Russians were asked to produce the regulation in question, they refused. Of such was the foundation of the newly formed four-power council.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 61-62 At first all Kommandatura meetings were strictly at the highest level, meaning the sector commandants. Out of necessity other meetings grew up, including meetings of deputies and committees, etc. The deputies were able to decide a vast majority of issues and questions at their own meetings, and passed on to their commanders only the most vital of items or when a decision could not be reached.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, page 62 Also, on occasion things were kicked up to the Allied Control Council when a consensus could not be reached on something of crucial importance by the Kommandatura,Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 56, 84, 86, 102, 112, 121, etc and perhaps kicked back down when the zonal commanders didn't want to be bothered by it.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 110, 137 In the beginning meetings were informal, and rules of procedure grew as they went along. The chairmanship changed every two weeks, but later it was monthly. The Russians won a coin toss at the suggestion of General Parks, and they filled the first chair. The Americans and British followed in rotation, along with the French after about three months.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 63-64 Even the position of the flags on the poles out in front of the Kommandatura headquarters rotated along with the chairmanship. Inside the Kommandatura the four commandants met in the main conference room, and sat at a large rectangular table with the chairman at the head. If the Union Jack was flying out front, the British commandant was at the head of the table, with the French commander to his right, and across the table the Russian representative, and next to him the American. Adjacent to each commandant was his deputy and political adviser. Groups of experts on divers topics rounded out much of the remainder of the personnel in the room, along with translators and clerical staff.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, page 157 Allied Commandants of Berlin, 1949. From left, Gen. Bourne (Brit.), Gen. Howley (U.S.) Gen. Kotikov (USSR), Gen. Ganeval (Fr.). The myriad committees met in many of the other rooms in the Kommandatura building, and handled routine work, issued orders to the city government, and worked through items not yet agreed upon. All such work was sent to the deputies at their respective meetings twice a month in the main conference room. Many such items were scrutinized for presentation at the commandants' meetings. There was so much work to get through, they had to develop a streamlined procedure to reduce everything to the bare essentials, else they \\"would have been swamped by bitter international wranglings,\\" Howley states.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 157-158 Language translation itself was cumbersome, but obviously necessary. Each commandant had translators selected for him by the respective Chiefs of Staff to handle the various parts of the discussion. These stood behind each respective commandant. When the American spoke, it was translated into French by the Frenchman's translator, and into Russian from the French by the Soviet commandant's translator. The Russian translator didn't understand English, but spoke excellent Russian and French. Each commandant would speak in staccato fashion to make easier work for the translators. Notes flowed constantly from the myriad advisers in the room to the commandants. Howley intimated he likely would have never lasted without those notes. They clarified, and probed, and shattered the arguments of others.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 158-159  Soviet walkout  As time passed, the quadripartite meetings of the Kommandatura got more and more heated and cantankerous. The western allied representatives were more or less unified in their view of how Berlin was to be governed, which often starkly contrasted with the Soviet point of view, not surprisingly so. Issues would be debated for weeks, and even months. One such issue was Kotikov's Fourteen Points regarding the legal and material position of the workers of Berlin. For eight months the Kommandatura debated this topic making no real headway. Without Kommandatura approval, the Soviet Military Administration issued Order No. 20 in their own sector, making all fourteen points law. This did not sit well with the others, nor did it abide the spirit of quadripartite and unanimous city governance.Breakup of the Allied Kommandatura. Retrieved: 15APR13 NCOs ready to hoist their national flags at the Kommandatura. During the Kommandatura meeting of June 16, 1948, the current chairman, French commandant General Ganeval, proposed that the Soviets rescind Order No. 20, so that the fourteen points could be individually reviewed and discussed. Up until that time the Soviets insisted on an all or nothing approach. They refused to rescind the order unless all other delegations agreed to the fourteen points unanimously and issued a quadripartite agreement to the effect of the same for the whole of Berlin. Discussions on this and other issues had dragged on for over thirteen hours at that point, and it was nearing midnight. That's when the American commandant, Colonel Howley, asked to be excused, as he had a heavy schedule planned for the following day. Chairman Ganeval gave permission, and Howley left his deputy, Colonel Babcock, in charge, just as he had done in times past when the situation required it.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 180-181 After Howley's departure, reports state that Colonel Yelizarov, Kotikov's deputy filling in for the supposedly ill Soviet commandant, held an excited, whispered exchange with their political commissar, L. M. Maximov. Yelizarov then stood and took offense at Howley's departure, and labeled it a \\"hooligan action.\\" (Howley and Yelizarov already had a history. Howely described him as a \\"big, powerful, bruiser,\\" who hunted wild boar with a machine gun in the woods outside Berlin. \\"He and I always kept one hand on the trigger.\\")Tales from Spandau: Nazi Criminals and the Cold War, Norman J. W. Goda, 2006, pages 41-42 At that point Ganeval proposed to close the meeting, but Yelizarov would have none of it. For eight minutes he berated an absent Howley, and offered that the Soviet delegation could no longer remain unless Howley return and apologize to all. Yelizarov headed for the door with Maximov closely in tow, whilst Ganeval reminded them that Howley had been properly excused. The French chairman indicated that it was indeed Yelizarov who was out of order and not Howley. The Russians departed in a maelstrom of confusion, but the record shows Ganeval closed the meeting due to the departure of the Soviet delegation and not Howley's excused absence.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 181-182 There were likely many things that contributed to the breakup. There was a rumored currency reform for the western zones of Germany, which actually did happen later.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, page 184 But unbeknownst to the western allies at the time, the Soviets had planned to blockade Berlin in mere days. In the end, the breakup of the Allied Kommandatura had been a planned work in progress for quite some time, according to Howley,Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 176 as it suited the purposes of the Soviets, period. It followed the pattern of the breakup of the Allied Control Council, when three months earlier Marshal Sokolovsky staged the walkout then.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, pages 177-178 For the balance of June, the Soviets did participate in limited quadripartite sub-committee meetings, and their clerical staff remained through July. But as of August 1, 1948, they lowered the red flag, removed their files, and the Soviets were gone for good. After that the three western sectors operated independently and unilaterally for a time. They resumed official Kommandatura meetings on November 8, 1948, but then only ever on a tripartite basis.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, page 257  Accomplishments  The differences in goals and methods of the East and the West, which came face to face in Kommandatura counsels so frequently, and which usually clashed, have their roots elsewhere.

It was founded by Alexandre Grendene Bartelle and his twin brother Pedro Grendene Bartelle.https://www.forbes.com/profile/alexandre-grendene- bartelle/  History  In 1971, the Bartelle brothers, Alexandre and Pedro, began to create plastic basket holders for wine that was produced in the mountains of Rio Grande do Sul. 5 years later, the company began producing plastic parts for farm machinery, eventually evolving to producing soles and heels for shoes. In 1979, Grendene produced their first sandal, the Melissa Aranha, after Pedro noticed the strip-sandals of fishermen from the French Riviera. A year later, the first Grendene plant specifically made for shoe mold manufacturing was opened in Carlos Barbosa. The company would go on to form partnerships with designers like Jean-Paul Gaultier and Thierry Mugler. In 1984, the company started producing shoes for kids and 1986 saw the first men's shoe released. In 1990, the first Grendle shoe manufacturing plant was built in Fortaleza, with a second one opening in 1993 in Sobral, and a third in 1997 in Crato. Grendene would start creating new brands, with the Grendha line in 1994, the Melissa line in 1996. 2002 saw the shoe take stage at Sao Paulo Fashion Week, and partner with models like Gisele B√ºndchen, along with becoming the number 1 shoe manufacturer within Brazil, by number of pairs. On October 29, 2004, Grendene began trading shares on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange. A new plant was open in Teixeira de Freitas in 2007. Grendene partnered with Vivienne Westwood and Zaha Hadid in 2008, as well as the launch of the Zaxy brand. More brands were created in 2009, with the launch of Cartago, the first line targeted to men. 2009 also marked the first time the company produced 150 million pairs of shoes. Today, Grendene has stores throughout the world, in London, New York City, Rio de Janeiro, and Milan. The company also partners with brands such as Mattel and Cartoon Network. In 2018, Grendene sold 173 million pairs of shoes and had 11 manufacturing plants, all located in Brazil.

Municipally it is incorporated as Rakhyinskoye Urban Settlement, one of the eight urban settlements in the district. Population: History In the end of the 19th century, Pavel Korf bought lands which currently belong to the settlement, for peat production. The closest village was Irinovka. In 1892, the first narrow-gauge railroad in Russia was constructed to transport peat. Torfyanaya railway station was open in the current area of the settlement (the name Torfyanaya originates from Russian torf, for peat). The settlement around the station for a long time did not have any name and was known as the Settlement No. 1. In 1911, the production stopped, and in 1913 Korf died. The station was located in Shlisselburgsky Uyezd of Saint Petersburg Governorate (since 1913, Petrograd Governorate). The peat production resumed in the 1920s. In 1922, Torfyanaya railway station was renamed Rakhya railway station, to commemorate Jukka Rahja. On February 14, 1923 Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was merged into Petrogradsky Uyezd. In January, 1924 the uyezd and the governorate were renamed Leningradsky. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Leninsky District, with the administrative center in the settlement of Vsevolozhskoye, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On August 19, 1930 Leninsky District was abolished and merged into newly established Leningradsky Prigorodny District with the administrative center in the city of Leningrad. On August 19, 1936 Leningradsky Prigorodny District was abolished, and Vsevolozhsky District, with the administrative center in Vsevolozhskoye, was established. In 1946, the settlement around Rakhya railway station was made an urban-type settlement and officially received the name of Rakhya. Economy Industry Currently, the main industrial enterprise in Rakhya is a paint- producing plant. The peat production has been discontinued. Transportation Rakhya is located on the railway connecting Saint Petersburg with Ladozhskoye Ozero railway station via Vsevolozhsk. There is suburban service to the Finland Station in Saint Petersburg. Rakhya is connected by road with Vsevolozhsk and Kirovsk and has access to the M18 highway connecting Saint Petersburg and Murmansk. Culture and recreation Rakhya contains four objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. They commemorate events of the World War II. Many monuments in the localities administratively subordinated to Rakhya, such as Kokkorevo or Osinovets, commemorate the Road of Life, which during the Siege of Leningrad connected Leningrad with the rest of the Soviet Union.

He pioneered research on Archaea, the third domain of life, in the USSR and in 1986-1991 was a head of the department of Molecular Biology of Archaea at the Georgian Academy of Sciences, Tbilisi. In 1991-2004 he has worked in Germany, at Max-Planck Institute for Biochemistry and at Regensburg University. Since 2004 he is working at the Pasteur Institute of Paris. David Prangishvili received a prize of Council of Ministers of the USSR for Excellence in Science and Technology in 1979. David Prangishvili has been elected Member of the Academia Europaea (2018), Member of the European Academy of Microbiology (2015), Foreign Member of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences (2011), visiting professor of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2015).

He is an author of more than 170 publications in scientific journals and books. Prangishvili‚Äôs studies have helped to reveal that DNA viruses of Archaea constitute a distinctive part of the viral world and that Archaea can be infected by viruses with a variety of unusual morphologies which have not been observed among viruses from the other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukarya. The results of his research provide new perspectives concerning the diversity and evolution of viruses and virus-host interactions. (12-14)  Publications  1\\\\.

In 1847, Imgard cut a blue spruce tree from a woods outside town, had the village tinsmith construct a star, and placed the tree in his house, decorating it with paper ornaments, gilded nuts and Kuchen.

After Mary Memorial picture showing Jane Kennedy as a background figure to the right of Mary, (Royal Collection) At the funeral of Queen Mary at Peterborough Cathedral on 1 August 1587, her ladies joined the procession in this order; Barbara Moubray, Christine Hog (the wife of Bastian Pagez), Ren√©e du Raullay, Marie Pagez, Jane Kennedy, and Susannah Kirkcaldy.La Morte de la Royne D'Escosse (1589), quoted in Memoirs of John Napier (Edinburgh, 1834), p. 144: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1915), p. 462, these six ladies are described as \\"eight Scottish women\\" who were penultimate in the funeral procession, followed by 166 black clad yeoman. Jane Kennedy collected two beds from Mary's belongings, one for the Duchess of Guise, the other for Madame de Ch√¢lons. She told the Spanish ambassador Bernardino de Mendoza that she had blindfolded Mary at the execution, as she had precedence of birth before Elizabeth Curle. Mendoza was considering if she should have a pension from Spain. He wrote that her ship was driven back to Portsmouth by a storm.Martin Hume, Calendar State Papers Simancas, vol. 4 (London, 1892), p. 177 Jane returned to Scotland and married Andrew Melville of Garvock. Garvock is east of the centre of Dunfermline. Andrew was a brother of the diplomats James Melville of Halhill and Robert Melville. In 1568 he brought a gold chain to Mary when she was imprisoned in Lochleven Castle, which she had left with the goldsmith John Mossman to make into a necklace.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 616. He baecame the master of Mary's household in England. Andrew and Jane were placed in joint custody of Mary's remaining jewels and silver plate.Letter Book of Amias Paulet(1874), p. 367: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1915), p. 304. Mary had asked Andrew to take some of her belongings back to Scotland and her son King James VI after her execution, including portraits of her ancestors and a piece of unicorn horn.Labanoff, A., ed., Lettres de Marie Stuart, vol. 7 (London, 1842), p. 254. Andrew Melville was detained in England for a time after Mary's execution, and James VI asked his ambassador Archibald Douglas to secure his release. Douglas found that Melville was already free.HMC Laing Manuscripts at the University of Edinburgh, vol. 1 (London, 1914), pp. 67-8. Loss of the ferry boat Jane and her servant Susannah Kirkcaldy were drowned on the 7 or 8 September 1589 crossing the river Forth between Burntisland, where the Melvilles held Rossend Castle, and Leith. The ferry boat was \\"midway under sail, and the tempest growing great carried the boat with such force upon a ship which was under sail as the boat sank presently.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 165-6, letters of William Ashby to Walsingham and William Cecil. Jane had been summoned by James VI to await the arrival of Anne of Denmark, who was then expected to arrive at Leith. The ferry boat sank after colliding with another vessel during the storm, and the sailors of the other boat, William Downie, Robert Linkhop, and John Watson of Leith were put on trial for the deaths of sixty passengers in January 1590. The outcome of the trial is not recorded.Robert Pitcairn, Ancient Criminal Trials (Edinburgh, 1833), pp. 185-186. The loss of the ferry boat in stormy weather with all but two of the passengers was subsequently blamed on witchcraft.Thomson, Thomas, ed., Memoirs of his own life by James Melville (Edinburgh, 1827), pp. 369-70. In the following year people from North Berwick were made to confess to raising the storms and incriminate Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell. According to the account of the witch trials in the tract Newes from Scotland, Agnes Sampson confessed to causing the storm by sinking a dead cat into the sea near Leith.Newes from Scotland (Roxburghe Club: London, 1816), sig. B3. In later years the disaster came to be blamed on an error of the sailors, said to be drunk in calm weather by a writer in 1636, who added that ¬£10,000 of goods and jewels were lost.William Fraser, Melvilles, Earls of Melville, and the Leslies, Earls of Leven (Edinburgh, 1890), p. 167: HMC 9th Report: Traquair House, (London, 1884), p. 252.

Cherokees first began to receive formal education around 1804 from missionary groups in northern Georgia. During the Cherokees forced removal to Oklahoma in 1838 education became virtually non-existent. For the remaining Cherokees in Western North Carolina education was provided by the Quakers through contract until the late 1800s. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians gained federal recognition by the U.S. Congress in 1868 and North Carolina state recognition just a few years prior. In 1890 the Bureau of Indian Affairs then known as the U.S. Indian Service provided boarding schools throughout Cherokee. The boarding schools became Cherokee day school in 1954 and in 1962 these community day schools were closed with the opening of a central elementary school.\\"Press Packet.\\" Cherokee Central Schools. 6 (7/11).

An allotment of .60% of the total gaming revenue received by the EBCI Tribal Government is placed aside for the Kituwah initiative. KPEP, in its efforts to further the language, has formed the Kituwah Language Revitalization Initiative. The purpose of this program is to improve the overall quality of life for Eastern Band of Cherokee members through increased fluency and cultural awareness by garnering community support, developing language programs for all community members, as well as reestablishing a public life for the language in which Cherokee is commonly heard and spoken. Currently there are two total immersion programs; early childhood education and elementary education. Five preschool classrooms are dedicated to educating children ages two to five years old, which accounts for 24 students currently. In 2010 the New Kituwah Academy became an independent of the Cherokee Central Schools of which it was a satellite the previous year. All students that attend the New Kituwah Academy are enrolled members of the EBCI. The school currently has a four-star license through the North Carolina Department of Child Development. Student who attend the school learn all the same curriculum material that students in other schools learn, the only difference is that the instruction at the New Kituwah Academy is in the Cherokee language. The elementary portion of the academy is guided by the North Carolina standard course of study and the No Child Left Behind Act. This is primarily accomplished by pairing teachers and fluent speakers within each classroom. Understanding the need to be bi-literate, and to score well on standardized testing, the academy teaches English language arts at the end of each school day.} To provide feed back to KPEP, the Cherokee Preservation Foundation (the Schools largest granting agency) concluded by saying this, \\"The Cherokee Language Revitalization initiative of the EBCI is not only unique, it is exceptional. It is to date, in the experience of this consultant incomparable to other tribal efforts. Acknowledgment needs to be give to the stakeholders themselves, all of whom are brilliant, courageous, passionate and committed people.

The duration required for an illness to be defined as chronic is generally greater than 12 months, but this can vary, and some organizations define it by limitation of function rather than a length of time. Regardless of the exact length of duration, these types of conditions are different than acute, or short-lived, illnesses which resolve or can be cured. There are many definitions for what counts as a chronic condition. However, children with chronic illnesses will typically experience at least one of the following: limitation of functions relative to their age, disfigurement, dependency on medical technologies or medications, increased medical attention, and a need for modified educational arrangements. There are many different diseases affecting children that have a prolonged course and can lead to disability or impairment including asthma, sickle cell anemia, congenital heart disease, obesity, neurodevelopmental conditions, and epilepsy. Due to improvements in public health and health infrastructure, infant and child mortality especially from infectious causes has decreased in most areas of the world. Therefore, children are living longer with chronic illnesses.  Epidemiology  It is difficult to know the exact number of children who have a chronic illness worldwide. Given that there is no agreement on the definition for a chronic illness and that quality data from every country is not guaranteed, there is a wide range of estimates of prevalence and incidence. In the United States, one study noted the prevalence of chronic conditions among youth more than doubled from 12.8% in 1994 to 26.6% in 2006. One important trend to consider is that the overall amount of children with chronic illnesses is increasing. This rise is likely due to decreased infant and child mortality from previously lethal diseases due to innovations in medication and other treatment as well as increased ability to diagnose and therefore discover chronic conditions.  Impact   Family  The presence of a child with a chronic illness in the home has multiple effects on the family's life as it may affect daily routines. One potential consequence is the physical space inside the home being altered by the need for home health or medical equipment. As such children typically require frequent appointments, caregivers can feel strain to participate in their other children's lives equally and may develop increased levels of stress and family discord. The time requirements could also increase social isolation from extended family members. Given the cost associated with the greater need for specialized treatments as well as decreased time to work, these families may also experience economic difficulties.  Development  Chronic illness can affect a child‚Äôs development at any stage. During infancy and childhood chronic illness can be detrimental to the development of secure attachment, interpersonal trust, self-regulation, and/or peer relation skills. During middle adolescence, chronic illness can prevent a child from being in school on a regular basis. This can affect a child's academic and social competence. During adolescence, chronic illness can affect the development of autonomy and self-image. It can also interfere with peer and romantic relationships, and the desire for independence can lead to poor treatment compliance. In terms of education, one study found that children in Australia with at least one chronic illness scored lower in five domains of educational readiness including social competence, emotional maturity and communication skills.  Management  In general, taking care of a child with a chronic illness will require not one provider, but a team that may include medical providers, therapists and educators, and other caregivers. Coping with a chronic illness can challenge many aspects of life, and there are some therapies that can help children and their families adjust to their condition. Programs that focus specifically on parenting include increasing positive interaction between parent and child and better communication about emotions.  Behavior Therapy  Behavior therapy in the setting of chronic illnesses aims to change learned behaviors that are problematic using classical conditioning and operant techniques. Some examples of behavioral therapy for children with asthma include stress management techniques and contingency coping exercises. In one study, the asthma patients randomized to such therapies demonstrated fewer behavioral adjustment problems. Additionally, systematic desensitization can be applied to children with illness to decrease the fear associated with some medical treatments that could be required of their condition such as imaging or invasive procedures.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one of the most common techniques used to build resilience in children suffering from chronic illnesses. CBT includes the practice of breathing exercises, relaxation training, imagery, distraction methods, coping models, cognitive coping skills, reinforcement for compliance, behavioral rehearsal, role-play and direct coaching. Another intervention that is gaining popularity is the PASS Theory of Intelligence. The PASS Model combines a multitude of interventions to create a well-rounded program to foster resiliency in not only the children but the families affected as well. The goals of the pass model are to minimize trauma symptoms, develop adaptive coping skills, strengthen resiliency, and connect families to support networks. References Kerig, P., Wenar, C. (2005).

The southern part of the street is surrounded by large green spaces and attractive residential neighbourhoods while its northern part, which enters the N√∏rrebro and North- West districts of Copenhagen, is dominated by former industry. The street takes its name after Fasang√•rden, a former royal pheasantry, in Frederiksberg Park. Location S√∏ndre Fasanvej begins at Valby Langgade and continues along the western margin of S√∏ndermarken and Frederiksberg Gardens to Smallegade, passing Roskildevej on the way. It then continues as Nordre Fasanvej, passing several major arteries, including Nylandsvej, Godth√•bsvej, Borups All√© and Hiller√∏dgade, before reaching Frederikssundsvej. History The oldest part of S√∏ndre Fasanvej, north of Roskildevej, was established in 1682 as an access road to the royal pheasantry behind Frederiksberg Gardens. The road was later extended northwards to Smallegade. The southern part of present-day S√∏ndre Fasanvej, between Valby Langgade and Roskildevej, was created in about 1870 as a driveway to a small cluster of nurseries. It was first known as Bag S√∏ndermarken (literally \\"Behind S√∏ndermarken\\") but was incorporated in S√∏ndre Fasanvej in about 1900. Nordre Fasanvej was established between 1883 and 1908 as a direct extension of S√∏ndre Fasanvej as the old part of the street was now called. The section north of Godth√•bsvej was until 1920 called √òstre Fasanvej (East Pheasant Road). A new Frederiksberg Hospital was built at the street in 1903, replacing the old hospital at Howitzvej. Notable buildings and residents Frederiksberg Hospital The west side of S√∏ndre Fasanvej, opposite the big parks, is dominated by areas of Single- family detached home, apartment buildings from the 1880s. Diakonissestiftelsen's development, located on the corner with Peter Bangs Vej, dates from the same time. Across the street from Diakonissestiftelsen is the former industrial site of the Royal Copenhagen porcelain manufactury, which has been transformed into a mixed-use neighbourhood now known as Porcel√¶nshaven (literally \\"The Porcelain Garden\\").

He is known for his attempt to establish an America's first college for African Americans, in New Haven, and for his role in the Amistad affair. Abolitionism Jocelyn served as the first pastor of the black congregation at the new Temple Street Church in New Haven, Connecticut. A former student of Yale College, Jocelyn was also the leading advocate for the establishment of an African-American college in New Haven. At the time there was no such college in the country, or anywhere else in the English-speaking world. Save a few exceptional cases, no college accepted African Americans as students. (Only a few years later, the short-lived Oneida Institute and the Oberlin Collegiate Institute, predecessor of Oberlin College, decided to. The short-lived New-York Central College was the first to accept, from its opening day, both negroes and women.) New Haven excitement Working closely with both William Lloyd Garrison and Arthur Tappan, he introduced his plan to create an African-American college to the New Haven community on September 7, 1831. Unfortunately, this coincided with the news of Nat Turner's slave revolt of late August ‚Äî some newspapers put stories of the proposed college and the revolt side-by-side ‚Äî hightening the fear of blacks nationwide. Jocelyn's project was met with overwhelming opposition ‚Äî the vote against it in New Haven was 700 to 4 ‚Äî and he eventually was forced to resign from his position as pastor of the African-American church. Jocelyn's plan was so controversial that his house was later attacked by a white mob. The mob also destroyed a black-owned hotel, a black-owned property, and Arthur Tappan's summer home. There was no college for African Americans in the country until the black-owned Wilberforce University opened in Ohio in 1856. Even still, these events did not prevent Jocelyn from continuing to work as a conductor of the Underground Railroad. In addition, Jocelyn also helped build a racially-integrated neighborhood in New Haven. Amistad affair In 1839, several Cuban slave traders were transporting a group of 53 African captives to a Caribbean plantation. The Africans had been illegally abducted and traded by Portuguese slave hunters. En route to the Caribbean, the Africans rebelled against the captain of their ship and killed several of the kidnappers. The ship was eventually seized by the United States off the coast of Long Island, New York, and the Africans were imprisoned in New Haven. Although they were acquitted of murder, a controversy erupted over the Africans' status: were they free, according to U.S. law, which did not permit the importation of slaves? Or should they be forcibly transported back to their owners in the Spanish colony of Cuba? This debate immediately attracted the attention of prominent abolitionists. Along with Lewis Tappan and Joshua Leavitt, Samuel Jocelyn founded the Amistad Committee. The goals of the committee were to endorse the freedom of the Africans and to fund the Africans' legal and living expenses. With the help of Jocelyn, the Africans won the case, with the Supreme Court ruling that the United States government must allow the Africans to return to their homeland.

One of the longest trips the robot has done is Brest- DouarnenezBrest-Douarnenez where Vaimos has done more than 100 km in an autonomous mode. Since Vaimos has made trips more than 350 km long. In 2013, Vaimos participated in the World Robotic Sailing Championship (WRSC) 2013 in Brest, France . Control The robot follows a desired trajectory which is a sequence of lines. When following a line, the robot has two modes. # the direct mode: the direction to be followed is consistent with the direction of the wind and the distance between the robot and its line corresponds to the GPS error (approx. 10 meters), # the tack mode: the direction to be followed is in the no-go zone and the distance to the line is less than 70 meters. Two nested control loops are implemented in the computer of Vaimos. The first loop corresponds to a low level controller which tunes the rudder and the sail provided in order to have a desired heading. The second loop generates the desired heading to make the line to follow attractive. With this two loop control strategy, we have the guarantee that the robot will always stay inside the required corridor.

The Holocaust in Belgium was the systematic dispossession, deportation, and murder of Jews and Roma in German-occupied Belgium during World War II. Out of about 75,000 Jews in the country in 1940, around 24,000 were murdered during the Holocaust. At the start of the war, the population of Belgium was overwhelmingly Catholic. Jews made up the largest non-Christian population in the country, numbering between 70‚Äì75,000 out of a population of 8 million. Most lived in the cities of Antwerp, Brussels, Charleroi and Li√®ge. The vast majority were recent immigrants to Belgium who had fled persecution in Germany and Eastern Europe, and, as a result, only a small minority actually possessed Belgian citizenship. Shortly after the invasion of Belgium, the Military Government passed a series of anti-Jewish laws in October 1940. The Belgian Committee of Secretary-Generals refused from the start to co- operate on passing any anti-Jewish measures and the Military Government seemed unwilling to pass further legislation. The German government began to seize Jewish-owned businesses and forced Jews out of positions in the civil service. In April 1941, without orders from the German authorities, Flemish collaborators pillaged two synagogues in Antwerp and burned the house of the chief rabbi of the town in the Antwerp Pogrom. The Germans created a in the country, the (AJB; \\"Association of Jews in Belgium\\"), which all Jews were required to join. As part of the Final Solution from 1942, the persecution of Belgian Jews escalated. From May 1942, Jews were forced to wear yellow Star of David badges to mark them out in public. Using the registers compiled by the AJB, the Germans began deporting Jews to concentration camps in Poland. Jews chosen from the registration lists were required to turn up at the newly established Mechelen transit camp; they were then deported by train to concentration camps, mostly to Auschwitz. Between August 1942 and July 1944, around 25,000 Jews and 350 Roma were deported from Belgium; more than 24,000 were killed before the camps were liberated by the Allies. From 1942, opposition among the general population to the treatment of the Jews in Belgium grew. By the end of the occupation, more than 40 per cent of all Jews in Belgium were in hiding; many of them were hidden by Gentiles, particularly by Catholic priests and nuns. Some were helped by the organized resistance, such as the (CDJ; \\"Committee of Jewish Defense\\"), which provided food and refuge to hiding Jews. Many of the Jews in hiding joined the armed resistance. In April 1943, members of the CDJ attacked the twentieth rail convoy to Auschwitz and succeeded in rescuing some of those being deported. Background Religion and Anti-Semitism The Great Synagogue of Brussels, built in 1875. Before the war, the population of Belgium was overwhelmingly Catholic. Around 98 per cent of the population was baptized and around 80 per cent of marriage ceremonies were held with traditional Catholic services, while politically the country was dominated by the Catholic Party. The Jewish population of Belgium was comparatively small. Out of a population of around 8 million, there were only 10,000 Jews in the country before World War I. The interwar period saw substantial Jewish immigration to Belgium. By 1930, the population rose to 50,000, and by 1940 it was between 70,000‚Äì75,000. Most of the new Jewish immigrants came from Eastern Europe and Nazi Germany, escaping anti-Semitism and poverty in their native countries. The Roma population of Belgium at the same time was approximately 530. Few of the Jewish migrants claimed Belgian citizenship, and many did not speak French or Dutch. Jewish communities developed in Charleroi, Li√®ge, Brussels and, above all, Antwerp, where more than half of the Jews in Belgium lived. The Interwar period also saw the rise in popularity of Fascist New Order parties in Belgium. These were chiefly represented by the (VNV; \\"Flemish National Union\\") and in Flanders, and in Wallonia. Both Flemish parties supported the creation of an ethnically Germanic \\"\\" (\\"Greater Dutch State\\") from which Jews would be excluded. , whose ideology was based on Christian Fascism, was particularly anti-Semitic, but both VNV and campaigned under anti-Semitic slogans for the 1938 elections. Their stance was officially condemned by the Belgian authorities, but prominent figures, including King Leopold III, were suspected of holding anti-Semitic attitudes. From June 1938, Jewish illegal immigrants arrested by the Belgian police were deported to Germany, until public condemnation halted the practice after in November 1938. Between 1938 and the start of the war, with the influence of Fascist parties declining in Belgium, the country began accepting more Jewish refugees, including 215 from the who had been refused visas elsewhere. German invasion and occupation In the interwar period, Belgium followed a strict policy of political neutrality. Though the Belgian Army was mobilized in 1939, the country only became involved in the war on 10 May 1940, when it was invaded by Nazi Germany. After a campaign lasting 18 days, the Belgian military, along with its commander-in- chief Leopold III, surrendered on 28 May. Belgium, together with the French province of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, were grouped together under the German Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France (Milit√§rverwaltung in Belgien und Nordfrankreich). Because the country was under military occupation, it initially fell under the control of the rather than Nazi Party or Schutzstaffel (SS) authorities. In July 1944, the Milit√§rverwaltung was replaced with a civilian administration (Zivilverwaltung), greatly increasing the power of the more radical Nazi Party and SS organisations until the Allied liberation in September 1944. The Holocaust Early discrimination and persecution, 1940‚Äì41 Trilingual (German-Dutch-French) signs used to mark Jewish-owned shops and businesses in Belgium from October 1940 On 23 October 1940, the German Military Administration adopted anti-Jewish legislation for the first time. The new laws, similar to the Nuremberg Laws adopted in Germany in 1935, coincided with the adoption of similar legislation in the Netherlands and in France. The laws of 28 October forbade Jews to practice certain professions (including the civil service) and forced Jews to register with their local municipality. On the same date, the German administration announced a definition of who was regarded as Jewish. Jewish-owned shops or businesses had to be marked by a sign in the window, and Jewish-owned economic assets had to be registered. From June 1940, a list of Jewish businesses had already been drawn up in Li√®ge. 1939 Belgium ID card issued to a Polish Jewish woman with over-tamp for JUIVE. In 1940, the German government began to liquidate Jewish businesses. Some were transferred to German ownership in a process termed Aryanization. Some 6,300 Jewish-owned businesses were liquidated before 1942, and 600 were Aryanized. Around 600 million Belgian francs was raised from the seizures, much less than anticipated. In total, between 28 October 1940 and 21 September 1942, 17 anti-Jewish ordinances were proclaimed by the Military Administration. =Association des Juifs en Belgique= The \\"Association of Jews in Belgium\\" (AJB) was a created by the Germans to administer the Jewish population of Belgium from November 1941. Though directed by the Germans, the AJB was run by Jews and acted as an \\"organizational ghetto\\", allowing the Nazis to deal with Belgian Jews as a unit. The AJB played a major role in registering Jews in the country. In total, 43,000 Jews were registered with the AJB. This number represents only half of the total Jewish population, reflecting the community's mistrust of the organization, but it was the figure that Adolf Eichmann presented as the total number of Jews in Belgium at the Wannsee Conference in January 1942. During the deportations, around 10,000 Jews were arrested based on their affiliation to the AJB. The AJB, closely supervised by the (Sicherheitspolizei und Sicherheitsdienst; \\"Security Police and Intelligence Service\\"), was also responsible for the administration of the transit camp at Mechelen. The AJB played a major role in persuading Jews to turn up voluntarily for deportation, though whether they knew the fate awaiting the deportees is disputed. From 1942, following the assassination by the Resistance of Robert Holzinger, an AJB leader, confidence in the association declined and it was regarded with increasing suspicion. After the war, the leaders of the AJB were tried and acquitted of complicity in the Holocaust. Radicalisation, 1941‚Äì42 =Antwerp Pogrom and Yellow Badge= The Belgian version of the Yellow Badge, compulsory from 1942 On 14 April 1941, after watching the German propaganda film , Flemish paramilitaries from the , VNV and began a pogrom in the city of Antwerp. The mob, armed with iron bars, attacked and burned two synagogues in the city and threw the Torah scrolls onto the street. They then attacked the home of Marcus Rottenburg, the town's chief rabbi. The police and fire brigade were summoned, but they were forbidden to intervene by the German authorities. As in the rest of occupied Europe, compulsory wearing of the yellow badge was enforced from 27 May 1942. The Belgian version of the badge depicted a black letter \\"J\\" (standing for \\"Juif\\" in French and \\"Jood\\" in Dutch) in the centre of a yellow star of David. The star had to be displayed prominently on all outer clothing when in public and there were harsh penalties for non-compliance. The decree sparked public outrage in Belgium. At great personal risk, the Belgian civil authorities in Brussels and Li√®ge refused to distribute the badge, buying time for many Jews to go into hiding. The German authorities in Antwerp attempted to enforce the wearing of badges in 1940, but the policy was dropped when non-Jewish citizens protested and wore the armbands themselves. Deportation and extermination, 1942‚Äì44 From August 1942, the Germans began deporting Jews, using (\\"recruitment for work\\") in German factories as a pretext. Around half of the Jews turned up voluntarily (though coerced by the German authorities) for transportation although round-ups were begun in late July. Later in the war, the Germans increasingly relied on the police to arrest or round up Jews by force. A modern view of Dossin Barracks in Mechelen which housed Mechelen transit camp during the occupation The first convoy from Belgium, carrying stateless Jews, left Mechelen transit camp for Auschwitz on 4 August 1942 and was soon followed by others. These trains left for extermination camps in Eastern Europe. Between October 1942 and January 1943, deportations were temporarily halted; by this time 16,600 people have been deported on 17 rail convoys. As the result of Queen Elisabeth's intervention with the German authorities, all of those deported in this first wave were not Belgian citizens. In 1943, the deportations resumed. By the time that deportations to extermination camps had begun, however, nearly 2,250 Belgian Jews had already been deported as forced laborers for , a civil and military engineering group, which was working on the construction of the Atlantic Wall in Northern France. In September, armed (DSK; \\"Currency protection command\\") units raided homes to seize valuables and personal belongings as the occupants were preparing to report to the transit camp, and in the same month, Jews with Belgian citizenship were deported for the first time. DSK units relied on networks of informants, who were paid between 100 and 200 Belgian francs for each person they betrayed. After the war, the collaborator Felix Lauterborn stated in his trial that 80 per cent of arrests in Antwerp used information from paid informants. In total, 6,000 Jews were deported in 1943, with another 2,700 in 1944. Transports were halted by the deteriorating situation in occupied Belgium before the liberation. The percentages of Jews which were deported varied by location. It was highest in Antwerp, with 67 per cent deported, but lower in Brussels (37 per cent), Li√®ge (35 per cent) and Charleroi (42 per cent). The main destination for the convoys was Auschwitz in German-occupied Poland. Smaller numbers were sent to Buchenwald and Ravensbr√ºck concentration camps, as well as Vittel concentration camp in France. In total, 25,437 Jews were deported from Belgium. Only 1,207 of these survived the war. Amongst those deported and killed was the surrealist artist Felix Nussbaum in 1944. Belgian collaboration in the Holocaust Internal civil service circular outlining the anti-Jewish laws of October 1940 Political collaboration Some assistance was provided to the German authorities in the persecution of Belgian Jews by members of collaborationist political groups, either out of overt anti-Semitic sentiment or the desire to demonstrate their loyalty to the German authorities. The deportations were encouraged by the VNV and the in Flanders and both, like Rex, published anti-Semitic articles in their party newspapers. An association known as / (\\"The People's Defence\\") was specially formed to bring together Belgian anti-Semites and to assist in the deportations. During the early stages of the occupation, they campaigned for harsher anti-Jewish laws. Administrative collaboration The German occupation authorities made use of the surviving infrastructure of the pre-war state including the Belgian civil service, police and Gendarmerie. These were officially forbidden by their superiors to assist the German authorities in anything other than routine maintenance of law and order. However, there were numerous incidents in which individual policemen or local sections assisted in the German arrest of Jews in breach of their orders. In Antwerp, the Belgian authorities facilitated the conscription of Jews for forced labour in France in 1941 and aided in the rounding up of Jews in August 1942 after the threatened to imprison local officials in Fort Breendonk. Outside Antwerp, the Germans used coercion to force the Belgian police to intervene, and in Brussels at least three police officers disobeyed orders and helped arrest Jews. The historian Insa Meinen argued that around a fifth of the Jews arrested in Belgium were rounded up by the Belgian policemen. Nevertheless, the general refusal of the Belgian police to assist in the Holocaust has been cited as a reason for the comparatively high survival rate of Belgian Jews during the Holocaust. Belgian opposition to Jewish persecution Belgian resistance to the treatment of Jews crystallised between August‚ÄìSeptember 1942, following the passing of legislation regarding wearing yellow badges and the start of the deportations. When deportations began, Jewish partisans destroyed records of Jews compiled by the AJB. The first organization specifically devoted to hiding Jews, the (CDJ-JVD), was formed in the summer of 1942. The CDJ, a left- wing organization, may have saved up to 4,000 children and 10,000 adults by finding them safe hiding places. It produced two Yiddish language underground newspapers, Unzer Wort (, \\"Our Word\\", with a Labour-Zionist stance) and Unzer Kamf (, \\"Our Fight\\", with a Communist one). The CDJ was only one of dozens of organised resistance groups that provided support to hidden Jews. Other groups and individual resistance members were responsible for finding hiding places and providing food and forged papers. Many Jews in hiding went on to join organised resistance groups. Groups from left wing backgrounds, like the (FI- OF), were particularly popular with Belgian Jews. The Communist-inspired (PA) had a particularly large Jewish section in Brussels. The resistance was responsible for the assassination of Robert Holzinger, the head of the deportation program, in 1942. Holzinger, an active collaborator, was an Austrian Jew selected by the Germans for the role. The assassination led to a change in leadership of the AJB. Five Jewish leaders, including the head of the AJB, were arrested and interned in Breendonk, but were released after public outcry. A sixth was deported directly to Auschwitz. The Belgian resistance was unusually well informed on the fate of the deported Jews. In August 1942 (two months after the start of the Belgian deportations), the underground newspaper reported that \\"They [the deported Jews] are being killed in groups by gas, and others are killed by salvos of machinegun fire.\\" In early 1943, the sent Victor Martin, an academic economist at the Catholic University of Louvain, to gather information on the fate of deported Belgian Jews using the cover of his research post at the University of Cologne. Martin visited Auschwitz and witnessed the crematoria. Arrested by the Germans, he escaped, and was able to report his findings to the CDJ in May 1943. Attack on the 20th transport A cattle truck used for the transport of Belgian Jews to camps in Eastern Europe. The openings were covered in barbed wire. This example is preserved at Fort Breendonk. The best-known Belgian resistance action during the Holocaust was the attack on the 20th rail convoy to Auschwitz. In the evening of 19 April 1943, three poorly armed members of the resistance attacked the railway convoy as it passed near Haacht in Flemish Brabant. The train, containing over 1,600 Jews, was guarded by 16 Germans from the . Resistance members used a lantern covered with red paper (a danger signal) to stop the train, and freed 17 prisoners from one wagon before they were discovered by the Germans. A further 200 managed to jump from the train later in the journey, as the train's Belgian driver deliberately kept his speed low to allow others to escape. All three resistance members responsible for the attack were arrested before the end of the occupation. Youra Livchitz was executed and Jean Franklemon and Robert Maistriau were deported to concentration camps but survived the war. The attack on the 20th train was the only attack on a Holocaust train from Belgium during the war, as well as the only transport from Belgium to experience a mass breakout. Passive resistance The treatment of Jews by the Germans led to public resistance in Belgium. In June 1942, the representative of the German Foreign Ministry in Brussels, Werner von Bargen, complained the Belgians did not exhibit \\"sufficient understanding\\" of Nazi racial policy. The Belgian underground newspaper called for Belgian citizens to make small gestures to show their disgust at the Nazi racial policy. In August 1942, the paper called for Belgians to \\"Greet them [the Jews] in passing! Offer them your seat on the tram! Protest against the barbaric measures that are being applied to them. That'll make the Boches furious!\\" Discrimination against Jews was condemned by many high-profile figures in the occupied country. As early as October 1940, the senior Catholic clergyman in Belgium, Cardinal Jozef-Ernest van Roey, condemned the German policy and particularly the legislation from 1942. Van Roey made many of the church's resources available for hiding Jews, but was prevented from publicly condemning the treatment of the Jews by his peers, who feared a Nazi repression of the Church. German attempts to involve the Belgian authorities and local government in its implementation began to arouse protest from 1942. The Committee of Secretary-Generals, a panel of Belgian senior civil servants tasked with implementing German demands, refused from the outset to enforce anti-Jewish legislation. In June 1942, a conference of the 19 mayors of the Greater Brussels region refused to allow its officials to distribute yellow badges to Jews in their districts. At great personal risk, the mayors, led by Joseph Van De Meulebroeck, sent a letter protesting the decree to the German authorities on 5 June. The refusal of Brussels' council, and later that of the city of Li√®ge, to distribute badges allowed many Jews to go into hiding before the deportations began. In the same year, members of the AJB met with Queen Elisabeth to appeal for her support against the deportations. She appealed to the Military Governor of Belgium, General Alexander von Falkenhausen, who sent Eggert Reeder, his deputy and head of the non-military aspects of the administration, to Berlin to clarify the policy with Heinrich Himmler. The (RSHA; \\"Reich Main Security Office\\") made concessions to Elisabeth, allowing Jews with Belgian citizenship to be exempt from deportation, and Jewish families would not be broken up. The RSHA also agreed not to deport Jewish men over the age of 65 and women over 60, after Belgian protests that they would be too old to be used as forced labor. Legacy and remembrance In the aftermath of the war, emigration to Israel further decreased the Jewish population of Belgium, which as of 2011 was estimated at between 30,000 and 40,000. The population is still concentrated in Brussels and Antwerp, but new smaller communities (such as those in Ghent, Knokke, Waterloo and Arlon) have developed since 1945. Notable Belgian Holocaust survivors include Fran√ßois Englert, a joint recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013, and Paul L√©vy, a well-known journalist (who converted to Christianity) who was also responsible for the design of the European flag. Stolperstein memorial to a victim of the Holocaust in Schaerbeek, Brussels Since the passing of the Holocaust denial law in 1995, it is illegal to deny or attempt to justify the Holocaust. The act follows the Belgian Anti-Racism Law, passed in 1981, which led to the establishment of the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism, which researches racism and anti-Semitism in Belgium as well as aiding victims of discrimination. Breendonk and Dossin Barracks (at the site of the former Mechelen transit camp) are preserved as museums to the Holocaust and to German repression in Belgium during the occupation. In 2004, the Belgian Senate commissioned the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (Cegesoma) to produce a definitive historical report on Belgian collaboration in the Holocaust. The report, entitled \\"Docile Belgium\\" (/), was published in 2007. It generated significant public interest in Belgium and abroad. The report's findings were controversial, as they emphasised the extent to which the Belgian police and authorities had collaborated in the deportation of Jews. As of 2013, a total of 1,612 Belgians have been awarded the distinction of Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel for risking their lives to save Jews from persecution during the occupation. Relatives of the victims have sought compensation from the state owned rail company SNCB after compensation was paid by the similar companies in France and the Netherlands. Between 1942 and 1943, SCNB chartered 28 convoys to transport prisoners from the Mechelen transit camp to Auschwitz. The director of the SCNB at the time was Narcisse Rulot who gave the explanation \\"I carry everything that comes, I do not look what is in the closed cars.\\" His lackadaisical attitude and permissive complacency is seen to have contributed to the suffering and deaths of thousands. Though the company has apologized, the families of the victims continue to insist on compensation.

The type species, Jaxtasuchus salomoni, was named in 2013 on the basis of several incomplete skeletons and other isolated remains. Like other doswelliids, members of the genus were heavily armored, with four longitudinal rows of bony plates called osteoderms covering the body. Jaxtasuchus is the first doswelliid known from Europe and is most closely related to Doswellia from the Late Triassic of the eastern United States. However, it was not as specialized as Doswellia, retaining several generalized archosauriform characteristics and having less armor. Jaxtasuchus fossils have been found in aquatic mudstones alongside fossils of temnospondyl amphibians, crustaceans, and mollusks, suggesting that Jaxtasuchus was semiaquatic like modern crocodilians. Discovery Fossils of Jaxtasuchus have been found in the Lower Keuper of southern Germany, which dates back to the end of the Middle Triassic. The osteoderms of Jaxtasuchus were originally interpreted as the dermal bones of temnospondyl amphibians and later as the plates of aetosaur reptiles. The only other archosauriforms currently known from the Lower Keuper are Zanclodon laevis, which is known from a jaw fragment and several teeth, and Batrachotomus kupferzellensis, a large pseudosuchian archosaur that is known from several skeletons. Jaxtasuchus is the most abundant archosauriform reptile in the Lower Keuper. Its remains have been uncovered in six fossil localities: Limestone quarries at Rielingshausen, Zwingelhausen, and Vellberg (which has two quarries: Schumann and Ummenhofen), as well as roadcuts at Kupferzell and Wolpertshausen. The holotype specimen, SMNS 91352, is a mostly complete skeleton missing the head and neck, which was found at the Schumann quarry of Eschenau (part of Vellberg). Another specimen from the same quarry, SMNS 91083, preserves an incomplete skull and neck. A third specimen from the quarry, SMNS 90500, preserves a forelimb, osteoderms, and a femur (thigh bone). Other more fragmentary specimens include vertebrae and osteoderms recovered from various other quarries and strata unearthed during highway construction. At some sites Jaxtasuchus is known only by its osteoderms. Jaxtasuchus is named after Jagst, a tributary of the Neckar river in the region where fossils were found. The type species J. salomoni is named after Hans Michael Salomon, who discovered the holotype specimen and donated it to the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Stuttgart where it is now housed.  Description   Skull  The maxilla was long and low, with 15 tooth sockets. It was covered with irregular pits and had an incision at its rear edge, likely representing the antorbital fenestra. Fragments of premaxilla and nasal bones were also preserved, with a similar texturing to the maxilla. The teeth were sharp and slightly curved. They were oval shaped in cross-section, and uniquely lacked serrations while also having pronounced longitudinal ridges along their labial and lingual (cheek- and tongue-facing) sides. A three-pronged bone has been identified as the postorbital. Its structure is similar to that of most diapsid reptiles, indicating that Jaxtasuchus likely retained a lower temporal fenestra like other diapsids. This contrasts with Doswellia, which has a smaller and stouter postorbital bone and a lower temporal fenestra which has been completely closed up, giving it a euryapsid skull. Braincase bones have also been preserved in one specimen. The occipital condyle, which was formed by the basioccipital bone, projected from the rest of the skull (in contrast with Archeopelta), and the paired exoccipital bones which lied upon it did not contact each other (similar to other doswelliids). While Doswellia had a pronounced peg-like extension on the rear surface of the supraoccipital bone, Jaxtasuchus only had a vertical ridge. The only preserved bone of the lower jaw is the angular, which has a concave upper edge that may have formed the base of a mandibular fenestra (a hole in the jaw common to most archosauriforms but absent in Doswellia).  Postcranial skeleton  The cervical (neck) vertebrae of Jaxtasuchus were characteristically longer than they were high, increasing in size towards the base of the neck. The neural spines were low and rectanglular, but were slightly taller at the base of the neck. The dorsal (torso) vertebrae, on the other hand, had wide neural spines with a roughly textured upper surface. This rough texturing signified where the vertebrae attached to the overlying osteoderms. The dorsal vertebrae were also longer than they were high, and some (but not all) had keels on their lower surface. Much like Doswellia, the ribs of Jaxtasuchus had an unusual shape, that being a long, slender rod bent at a 90 degree angle. Also like Doswellia, the \\"corner\\" of the bend has a rough ridge at the front. Nevertheless, the ribs of Jaxtasuchus did not extend outwards to the same extent as those of Doswellia. Caudal (tail) vertebrae were also elongated. Jaxtasuchus was covered with armor plates known as osteoderms. The osteoderms lay on the body in four longitudinal rows: two inner rows of paramedian osteoderms (i.e. ones which were adjacent to the midline of the body) and a single row on each side placed lateral to these paramedian rows. Most of the osteoderms were roughly textured by a radiating web of ridges and pits, although they also had a flat, smooth front edge which was thinner than the rest of the plate. The middle of each osteoderm plate had a mound-like prominence covered with small pits. The paramedian osteoderms were generally wider than the lateral ones, and had a higher prominence. The osteoderms at the level of the axis vertebra (second cervical) were trapezoidal, while those at the third cervical were broad. The rest of the cervicals had elongated and rectangular osteoderms, with the paramedians being twice as long as they were wide and the lateral osteoderms being three times as long. The dorsal osteoderms were flexed, rather than perfectly flat, and were slightly longer than wide. However, dorsal osteoderms directly in front of the hip were wider than they were long. At the base of the tail, the square-shaped paramedian osteoderms gradually lose their texture while the lateral osteoderms keep theirs. Further down the tail, the paramedian osteoderms become longer and finely pitted, while the lateral osteoderms shrink into triangular structures and then disappear. Small, keeled osteoderms were present on the limbs. Based on the flexed paramedian osteoderms, Jaxtasuchus likely had a more tall and narrow torso than Doswellia, which possessed six medial rows of osteoderms before flexure started to occur. Despite the heavy armor of the torso, the limb bones of Jaxtasuchus were fairly small and slender, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. The bones of the forelimb were slender and unspecialized, similar to those of Euparkeria rather than the robust structures of Erythrosuchus. The metacarpals were long and slender, but the hand was not complete enough to come to specific conclusions on its structure. The hindlimbs were also typical of generalized early archosauriforms, and the femur (thigh bone) had an apparent fourth trochanter. The metatarsals were also similar to those of Euparkeria. Phylogeny Cladogram after Schoch & Sues, 2013:  Paleobiology  Fossils of Jaxtasuchus in Vellberg come from mudstones that were most likely deposited in brackish-water lakes or marshes. Because its fossils are common, they were probably not swept into aquatic environments from terrestrial areas. Jaxtasuchus was probably semiaquatic like modern crocodilians and resembled them in having heavy armor, short limbs, and a long tail. Sharp teeth suggest that Jaxtasuchus was most likely carnivorous. Aquatic temnospondyl amphibians such as Callistomordax, Kupferzellia, and Mastodonsaurus are common components of the fossil assemblage. Fossils of bivalves and ostracode crustaceans in these deposits provide evidence of fluctuating salinity levels over time, with most fossil vertebrates are found in layers corresponding to low salinity.

Nicholas Brend's two unmarried sisters, Anne and Judith, both died in 1599, Judith having made her last will at the house of her uncle, John Collet, on 20 April of that year.. Shortly after Thomas Brend's death, by an agreement dated 17 November 1598, Nicholas Brend purchased for ¬£1150 the properties which Thomas Brend had left Anne and Judith in his will, including Judith's properties called the Pomegranate in Bridge Street and the Peacock in Candlewick Street.Conveyance by bargain and sale from Judith Brend to Nicholas Brend Retrieved 29 March 2013. As Berry notes, this purchase put a strain on Nicholas Brend's finances.. By October 1601, when he fell mortally ill, Nicholas Brend was considerably in debt. At the time he estimated that he owed ¬£1478. In fact his debts eventually amounted to ¬£1715, and considering that several of his properties required repairs, the shortfall was in reality closer to ¬£2150. To meet current expenses he had borrowed ¬£105 from his sister, Mary Maylard, and had sold a small property in West Molesey for ¬£340 to one of the Queen's Ladies of the Privy Chamber, Dorothy Edmonds.Wife of Sir Christopher Edmonds (d.1596). Faced with these financial difficulties, in his final days he entered into a series of complicated transactions with his half brother, John Bodley of Streatham, his uncle, John Collet, and his friend, Sir Matthew Browne of Betchworth Castle, Surrey, under which Collet and Browne would act as his trustees,. and under which: > Bodley would pay the debts and in return take a mortgage on the properties > in Bread Street and Southwark, including, now, the Globe...So on October 7, > Bodley, Collet, and Browne agreed in writing to pay the debts and Collet to > give Nicholas ¬£250 in cash.

The aim of the site is to document examples of sexism from around the world. Entries may be submitted directly to the site, or by email or tweet. The accounts of abuse are collated by a small group of volunteers. The launch of this website is considered to be the beginning of fourth-wave feminism.  History  After graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in English Literature, Bates worked as a nanny and found that the young girls she looked after were already preoccupied with their body image. She set up the Everyday Sexism Project in April 2012 after finding it difficult to speak out about sexism. Nearly a year after beginning the website, Bates reflected on the common response she had received. \\"Again and again, people told me sexism is no longer a problem ‚Äì that women are equal now, more or less, and if you can‚Äôt take a joke or take a compliment, then you need to stop being so 'frigid' and get a sense of humor\\", she told Anna Klassen of The Daily Beast website in April 2013. \\"Even if I couldn‚Äôt solve the problem right away, I was determined that nobody should be able to tell us we couldn‚Äôt talk about it anymore.\\" At the time of the 2012 foundation of Everyday Sexism website, Bates had \\"hoped to gather 100 women's stories\\", but a year after the launch she wrote in The Guardian that it had grown very rapidly \\"as more and more women began to add their experiences ‚Äì women of all ages and backgrounds, from all over the world\\", and was then \\"about to spread to 15 countries\\". The Financial Times journalist Lucy Kellaway wrote about Bates and the project in the summer of 2014: \\"I have undergone an unsettling change of heart, and dumped almost all my beliefs on what it is to be a woman in Britain.\\" The project affected Kellaway \\"in a way that the writings of Camille Paglia, Natasha Walter or Naomi Wolf never have. For the first time since the 1970s, I find myself cross on behalf of women, and rather inclined to take up cudgels. What has swayed me are not statistics or arguments but real stories of sexism. So far she has collected more than 60,000 of them, which sit there online, hard to ignore or dismiss.\\" One feminist critic has been uncomplimentary. \\"Simply coughing up outrage into a blog will get us nowhere\\", wrote Germaine Greer in the New Statesman when she reviewed Bates' book Everyday Sexism in May 2014. In April 2014, Bates was named as one of Britain's most influential women in the BBC Woman's Hour Power List 2014.  Campaign outcomes  In January 2014, Everyday Sexism successfully campaigned for the removal of the mobile app Plastic Surgery & Plastic Doctor & Plastic Hospital Office for Barbie Version from the App Store and Google Play, for its promotion of a poor perspective on the concept of body image to those of a young age. The Everyday Sexism Project has advised British Transport Police on the training of their officers to respond to complaints of unwanted sexual behaviour as part of Project Guardian, an initiative to increase reporting of sexual offences on public transport in London. Bates told Brogan Driscoll of The Huffington Post in April 2015: \\"The entries have been used to work on policy with ministers and members of parliament in multiple countries, to start conversations about consent in schools and universities, to tackle sexual harassment in businesses and workplaces and to help police forces raise the reporting and detection rates on sexual offences.\\"  Further reading  * See also * Everyday Lesbophobia, website about the negativity and discrimination faced by lesbians References External links * *Everyday Sexism on Twitter *Women Under Siege Category:Feminist websites Category:Sexism Category:Fourth-wave feminism ","title":"Everyday Sexism Project"},{"id":"39129800","text":"John Arthur Lewis (called John;Jesus College, Cambridge ‚Äì Donor Report 2009‚Äì10 \\"List of Donors 2009‚Äì10\\" (Accessed 19 April 2013) born 4 October 1934) was Archdeacon of Cheltenham from 1988 to 1998.Church news The Times (London, England), Monday, April 27, 1998; pg. 25; Issue 66186 Lewis was educated at Jesus College, Oxford and ordained after a period of study at Ripon College Cuddesdon in 1960.Crockford's Clerical Directory 1975-76 p588 London: Oxford University Press, 1976 After curacies in Prestbury and Wimborne Minster he held incumbencies in Nailsworth and Cirencester ‚ÄòLEWIS, Ven.

The first 6 locomotives were ordered in 1956. They entered service between 1959 and 1963. The locomotives were built by 2 manufacturers, Valmet and Lokomo, both based in Tampere. All Hr12 class locomotives with even numbers were produced by Valmet, while all odd numbers were produced by Lokomo. The locomotives were withdrawn in the early 1990s. Features  When it was introduced, the Dr12 gave drivers a new experience of comfort and forward visibility compared to steam locomotives, but compared to the newer VR Class Dr13, the Dr12 had a heavy axle load and slow acceleration with a top speed of only 120 km/h. The reason for this was that the locomotive turned out to be underpowered. The problem of the top speed was corrected in the last 10 locomotives by changing the transmission in such a way that the technical top speed was increased to 140 km/h, but this feature was never used. As a result, the entire locomotive series had a maximum permissible speed restricted to 120 km/h. However, due to the high axle weight, the Dr12 had good adhesion properties and it was considered to be a reliable and robust locomotive. It was well-suited to heavy trains with relatively low speed requirements. In addition to the underpowered engine, the second problem of the Dr12 was the heavy axle load, which could damage lightly laid tracks. In practice it could only be used on Western Finland's heavily laid lines.  Technology  Dr12 consisted of two three-axle bogies each of which had one driving motor per axle, on which rested a very rigid steel body with the hardware and the cabins. The locomotive had one large 182-liter 1,800 hp V16 diesel engine mounted in its centre, which was directly connected to the main and auxiliary generator sets. Cabins had safety zones in both ends which were designed to protect the driver and equipment in a collision. Two locomotives could be connected to be controlled by one set of controls, but this feature was used very rarely. Use  Dr12 was intended for use on heavy passenger and freight trains. As the timetables got tighter, the acceleration of the Dr12 turned out to be insufficient for passenger trains. Both the locomotive numbers 2200 (made by Valmet) and 2201 (made by Lokomo) started their careers in April 1959. The locomotives were based at Tampere depot, where they initially pulled express trains and heavy freight trains between Helsinki and Sein√§joki and between Riihim√§ki and Kouvola. The electrification of the main lines and the upgrade of the tracks allowed the operating area of the Dr12s to expand to unelectrified lines in the East and North, where they replaced the VR Class Hr1 and VR Class Tr1 locomotives. By 1980 Finland's major railway lines had been electrified, which drastically reduced the need for diesel traction. In the end Dr12 locomotives were used in Turku and Tampere areas, including the Turku‚ÄìTampere line. The last Dr12 locomotive (no. 2216) was withdrawn after pulling a timber train from Salo, Finland to Turku on 19 December 1990. This same locomotive is now preserved and it was used at the VR Group's 150th anniversary in August 2012 on the Hanko‚ÄìHyvink√§√§ line.

On Halloween in 1977, he received a written warning from BBC management in Bristol after he had ended the closedown routine at 1.20 am (following a Vincent Price horror film, The Tomb of Ligeia) by using a 500 watt uplight to cast spectral shadows across his face as he warned any viewers with black cats to keep a close eye on them that night in case they were abducted by witches. Today was Sykes' first break into national media. He was hired by the programme soon after covering the 1978 sleeper-train fire in Taunton, Somerset, in which 12 people died. Sykes had interviewed a seriously burned survivor, who said from his hospital bed that many passengers had been unable to escape the flames and smoke because the carriage doors were locked and there was nothing available with which to break the sealed double-glazed windows.[Source: Sykes himself] On Today, Sykes worked as a reporter and as frequent presenter along with Brian Redhead and John Timpson. In 1987 Sykes moved to the PM programme as a presenter. In 1995 he went back on the road as a reporter for PM and its sister programmes The World at One, The World this Weekend and Broadcasting House. Assignments Over the course of his career, Sykes has reported from many countries across the world. Whilst working for Today he reported the 1980 Carter-Reagan US Presidential election and covered the 1984 miners' strike. In recent times Sykes has particularly focused on reporting from the Middle East including the Iraq War, the presidential election in Iran in 2009, and the rise, decline and fall of the 'Arab Spring' in Egypt between 2011 and 2013. Sykes has reported regularly from Iraq, Pakistan, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, the occupied Palestinian Territories, South Africa, Germany, Turkey and Northern Ireland. He has also been on assignment in India, China, Syria, Russia, France, Italy, Spain, Mozambique, Tanzania, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Ethiopia, Yemen and South Sudan. Sykes has survived a roadside bomb during the 2005 elections in Iraq, a death threat in Northern Ireland, and an assault by striking coal miners in Wigan who tried to throw him into a canal. Awards In 2004 and 2005, Sykes was awarded the Gold and Silver Sony Radio Academy awards as Journalist of the Year. He also won Deuxi√®me Prix at the Bayeux war correspondents' awards, les prix Bayeux-Calvados des correspondants de guerre, three times.

Afr. (8 June 1852 ‚Äì 30 November 1917) was a priest of the White Fathers missionary society who was Vicar Apostolic of Tanganyika from 1891 until his death in 1917, in what is now Tanzania. He took responsibility for the vicariate at a time of great danger, when the missions were insecure havens for people fleeing slavers. As the country settled down, he oversaw expansion in the number of missions and schools. He was the author of a book on the ethnography of the local people that won a prize from the French Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie. Early career Adolphe Lechaptois was born at Cuill√©, Mayenne, France on 6 June 1852. He attended the seminary of Laval. In October 1872 he joined the White Fathers (Missionary Society of Africa), and taught for two years at the junior seminary at Algiers since the newly formed society was short of staff. He began his theological studies in November 1875. He was ordained a priest of the White Fathers on 6 October 1878 by Cardinal Charles Lavigerie, the founder of the society. He taught at the junior seminary and was assistant to the master of novices at the society's mother house at Maison Carr√©e, Algeria. In 1884 he was appointed master of novices. In 1886, he was made regional superior of Kabylie, Algeria. In this position he encouraged the establishment of villages where Christian converts would settle. Nyasa East Africa Cardinal Lavigerie was concerned that the campaign to suppress slavery would cut off the missions around Lake Tanganyika from communication with the coast. He was interested in opening a new supply route from the port of Quelimane in the Portuguese colony of Mozambique via the Zambezi and Shire rivers to Lake Malawi and then on to Lake Tanganyika. At the same time, the Portuguese wanted to gain international recognition of their claim to the territory to the south and west of Lake Nyasa. In June 1889 the White Fathers signed an agreement with the crown of Portugal to set up a mission at the village of chief Mponda, at the southern end of the lake. Lechaptois was chosen to lead the mission, assisted by two other priests, two lay brothers and two African assistants. One of the lay brothers died in an accident at Zanzibar. The other missionaries reached Quelimane in September 1889, where they learned that the British were claiming jurisdiction over the region to the west and south of the lake. With considerable difficulty, the missionaries made their way north, reaching Mponda's village on 28 December 1889. The Portuguese withdrew their troops from the Shire and Kololo districts in January 1890, but the White Fathers went ahead with their mission beside Mponda's compound. They had difficulty with Mponda, who was Muslim and a heavy drinker, and used force to maintain his power. The missionary Robert Laws had also had trouble with Mponda. The missionaries provided medical services and taught the local Yao people in their own language, with some success. However, in August 1891 British control over the region was confirmed by an agreement with Portugal. Lavigerie ordered the missionaries to move north towards Tanganyika. Traveling by lake steamer, to the Protestant mission of Livingstonia, then continuing on foot, they eventually reached the village of Nsokolo Chitambi, paramount leader of the Mambwe people, where they rested. Lachaptois continued north alone to the mission of Karema on the east shore of Lake Tanganyika to ask Bishop L√©once Bridoux for permission to set up a mission with the Mambe of Bembaland. Congo and Tanganyika Bishop Bridoux died on 20 October 1890. On 19 June 1891 Lechaptois was appointed his successor as Vicar Apostolic of Tanganyika and Titular Bishop of Utica. He made his base at Karema, which he reached on 8 September 1891. From there he visited the missions of Mpala, Mrumbi and Kibanga on the west shore. The Swahili-Arab slave traders were active in the region, causing great insecurity. The missions could do little except defend themselves, their orphanages and the refugees from the slavers. The Apostolic Vicariate of Upper Congo was separated from Tanganyika in 1892, led by Bishop Victor Roelens. Lechaptois returned to France where he took part in the general chapter of the society. He was consecrated bishop on 20 May 1895 by Archbishop Prosper Auguste Dusserre. He returned to Karema in 1895 with the first members of the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa to work in the region. The Apostolic Vicariate of Nyassa was separated from Tanganyika on 12 February 1897, led by Joseph Dupont. Lechaptois founded the missions of Kala, Zimba, Utinta, Mkulwe and Galula between 1895 and 1901. The German colonial authorities in what was then German East Africa generally supported his efforts, although there were some disputes over the demarcation of areas assigned to the Catholic and Moravian missions. During the first part of the 20th century Lechaptois opened many schools, as well as five orphanages. The training center for catechist- teachers moved several times. eventually settling at Zimba. The center at Karema became a junior seminary, and a major seminary was opened at Utinta. In 1913 Lechaptois published a set of studies of the people of the region based on his observations during twenty years. With obvious sympathy he described the history of the Fipa and Bende people, their politics, family structure, crafts, traditions, art, science and music. The Geographical Society of Paris awarded him their silver medal for the book. Lechaptois died on 30 November 1917 at Karema. Father Avon administered the vicariate until Joseph-Marie Birraux was named the new Vicar Apostolic.

It consists of a series of live jams recorded at Klaus Dinger's studio near Kamperland in the Dutch province of Zeeland. The album was produced and released quickly in comparison with its prequel D√ºsseldorf, which evolved over a period of two years. Zeeland was released on the Japanese record label Captain Trip Records, which released all of La! Neu?'s work.  Recording, release and reception  After the recording and release of D√ºsseldorf, Dinger was anxious to continue his work with Andreas Reihse and Victoria Wehrmeister, and so travelled with them to his Dutch studios. Here they began an intensive period of \\"spontaneous and relatively unprepared\\" jamming, quickly constructing songs from riffs and drones.

It hangs under the glass rotunda at the entrance to the Victoria and Albert Museum in South Kensington, London. Considered to be an artwork as much as a source of light, it was installed in 1999 and then substantially altered and enlarged to its current size in 2001, coinciding with a V&A; exhibition of the artist's work.  Description  The chandelier has dimensions of and is made of blown glass. The original name was Ice Blue and Spring Green Chandelier. It was created with blue, green, and yellow glass composed of fused, relatively small swirling tendrils and sharp protruding edges that extend outward from every side. The top and the bottom are composed of a more rounded shape, while a smaller round arrangement of glass hangs in the middle. The top has a notable protrusion, mainly of light blue glass, which then develops into shades of yellow and green as the viewer's eye moves downwards. Detail of the chandelier The first chandelier was installed in 1999 and was more modest, however, Chihuly decided it needed to be bigger and enlarged it so that it now fills the central rotunda at the entrance to the museum. Commenting in The Daily Telegraph, art critic Richard Dorment noted: \\"The V&A; chandelier isn't exactly 'finished' ‚Äì Chihuly just stopped adding baubles and curlicues and wiggly bits to it. Because its shape is so amorphous, there is no aesthetic reason that I can see why the glass-maker should not continue to ornament the work for the rest of his life, or for as long as the laws of physics allow him to\\". While referred to as a chandelier, technically this is a hanging sculpture, a concept Chihuly has favored throughout his career. His technique is to let the glass naturally shape itself. This approach, in combination with his use of vibrant colors, has been described by curator Tina Oldknow as creating: \\"vessels that communicate a range of aesthetic experience from the ephemeral moods‚Ä¶to the highly emotional, transformational environments realized in large-scale installations\\".Tina Oldknow, \\"Dale Chihuly: A Selective Biography,\\" Glass Art Society Journal (2003), 12-15. Like most of Chihuly's works, the chandelier does not light up on its own. In some instances, lights were placed on the piece after the fact or external spotlights were directed towards the structure to illuminate them.William Warmus, The Essential Dale Chihuly Book, (New York: Wonderland Press, 2000), 78.  Care and maintenance  The massive size of the chandelier and the delicate nature of the glass meant the museum had had to make special accommodations to house and maintain it. Before the chandelier could even be installed, the V&A; had to reinforce the ceiling. Cleaning the chandelier requires specialist techniques. It is cleaned piece by piece by a technician on a raised platform. The technician moves slowly around the chandelier cleaning each individual spike and tendril of glass with an antistatic wand made of plastic filaments. This has to be carried out before the museum opens, a process that takes several days.  Critics' response  The critical response was generally positive, if somewhat uncertain. The London Evening Standard reported: \\"Whether it attracts you or appals you, Chihuly‚Äôs work is certainly breathtaking\\". Another critic, writing in a home- interest magazine, said: \\"Wriggling like a large and glowing creature of the sea, this spectacularly weird glass chandelier‚Ä¶[is] the first time Dale‚Äôs work has been seen on this scale in the UK and he seems to gather a few more admirers as a result\\".Jennifer Hawkins Opie, Editor., Chihuly at the V&A; (Portland: Portland Press, 2001), 28.  Duplicates  A similar Dale Chihuly chandelier hangs at Scotts Square, Singapore A duplicate of the 1999 version of the chandelier can be seen at Scotts Square, a shopping centre and residential complex in Singapore. As with the V&A; Rotunda Chandelier, its location in the entrance atrium means natural light shines down onto the glass structure creating additional interplay of light.

F1 locomotives used in Helsinki, Tampere, Turku and Viipuri for local traffic, which they could easily handle. When the local transport in the early 1900s increased the F1 locomotives proved no longer sufficiently powerful, and they were replaced by more powerful Vk1 / I1 locomotives. They were employed moving lightweight mixed trains short distances, a task for which they were well suited. The F1s were withdrawn in the 1930s.

Snowboard racing can be done against the clock, or by two or more competitors racing in a head-to-head format. The current Olympic snowboarding racing events are parallel giant slalom, parallel slalom and snowboard cross.  Governing body  World tour events in snowboard racing are hosted by the FIS (Federation International De Ski). The FIS currently organises both a world cup tour and a world championship for each of the Olympic snowboard racing events (parallel giant slalom, parallel slalom and snowboard cross). The International Snowboard Federation was the former governing body. The struggling International Snowboard Federation does not currently host a world tour in any snowboard racing format, but it is possible that it may host a tour for banked slalom in coming years.  Events The major racing events are as follows:  Parallel giant slalom  (PGS): The parallel giant slalom event includes two evenly spaced courses (10‚Äì15 meters apart) with vertical distances of 20‚Äì27 meters between turning gates, allowing speeds up to 70 km/h. Once qualifications are complete, racers are placed in a head to head knockout format, starting with 16 athletes and moving to a final race for 1st and 2nd. It uses a much longer course than parallel slalom with gates set further apart (spaced 20‚Äì27 meters apart), resulting in even higher speeds, while racing against an opponent on a similar course place parallel to the other course. Parallel giant slalom is an Olympic event, and the FIS organises a world tour and world cup for this event.  Giant slalom  (GS): The original Olympic discipline for snowboard racing was giant slalom, but it featured in only one Winter Olympics (Nagano 1998). It uses a much longer course than slalom, with gates set further apart (spaced 25‚Äì32 meters apart), resulting in even higher speeds. This event is still staged at Continental Cup and Regional level, but the last giant slalom world cup was held in 2000 at Mt. Ste Anne, Quebec, Canada, with Jasey-Jay Anderson (CAN) and Karine Ruby (FRA)] winning.  Parallel slalom  (PSL): Parallel slalom debuted at the Olympics in 2014 in Sochi, Russia. Boarders race downhill through sets of gates that force extremely tight and quick turns (spaced 8‚Äì15 meters apart), requiring plenty of technical skill while racing against an opponent in the other course.  Triple slalom  (TS): The triple slalom is a concept event that has been tested as a North American cup event in November 2011 at Copper Mountain. It was spearheaded by the Canadian team, as FIS had discussed it as a world cup event and possibly an Olympic format for slalom, but it had not been tested till that point. Once it was tested, it was realized it may have potential but was not the right fit for an Olympic discipline.  Slalom  (SL): In slalom, boarders race downhill through sets of gates that force extremely tight and quick turns, (spaced 8‚Äì15 meters apart) requiring plenty of technical skill while racing against the clock. The winner of this event is based on 2 runs combined time.  Super-G  (SG): Boarders competing in a Super G event travel through sets of gates spaced 30‚Äì40 meters apart, requiring plenty of courage and speed while testing the endurance of the racer at speeds of up to 100 km/h. This has not been a world cup event since 1999 at Mt. Bachelor, Oregon.  Snowboard cross  (SBX): In snowboard cross, four snowboard racers start simultaneously atop an inclined course. The racers go over a series of features while trying to reach the finish line first. Snowboard cross became an Olympic sport in 2006.  Team snowboard cross  Team snowboard cross is a relatively new event. US Snowboard requested it be a part of the Winter Olympics starting in 2018. It will be confirmed in Fall 2014. --MJB 18:06, 29 June 2014 (UTC)FIS Snowboard .  Banked slalom  Banked slalom is a loosely organized group of events, primarily in the Pacific Northwest, but now seen increasingly across Western North America and the rest of the Snowboard world. Well established and iconic Banked Slalom events include Mt. Baker Banked Slalom, Neil Edgeworth Banked Slalom (NEBS) at Big White, BC and Dicks Ditch Classic (Jackson Hole, Wy). It consists of a gully run that is left largely unprepared by machines, safety fencing on the turns and in spill zones and an open relaxed format that promotes a fun spirited friendship among competitors and volunteers. It is a rite of passage to win the Baker Banked Slalom, including many of the strongest Snowboard racers and freestylers in the world including Ross Rebagliati, Terje Haakonsen and Maelle Ricker.

The fund manager seeks to invest in start-up companies which contribute to the UK Government target of reducing waste sent to landfill and places emphasis on strong management teams.  History  The Company was established by Nick Ross and Mike Dunn in 2011 with a focus on renewable energy infrastructure projects. Since its conception, the Iona Capital Ltd has been making financially driven investments primarily in the Anaerobic Digestion (AD) plants. Mike Dunn brought 20 years of waste management and investment infrastructure experience to the company. Nick Ross has a broad range of investment experience having sat on a number of investee company boards. The company moved into their new offices at 123 Pall Mall, in March 2019.  Funds under management   Iona Environmental Infrastructure LP (IEILP)  IEILP was established in 2011 to attract institutional investors to invest in Anaerobic Digestion (AD) or In-vessel composting (IVC) plant operations, or companies demonstrating similar investment characteristics  Iona Environmental Infrastructure 2 LP (IEILP 2)  IEILP 2 was established in 2013 with a similar investment mandate to IEILP 1. It closed at ¬£120m and has subsequently been fully invested in large electrical anaerobic digestion plants and biomass combined heat and power infrastructure, often in partnership with commercial power offtakers. The build out of the IEILP 2 assets has been completed, and these assets are now contributing to the decarbonisation of the UK electricity grid.  Iona North West Environmental Infrastructure LP (IEILP NW)  In parallel with the raise of IEILP 2, Iona Capital also raised a ¬£25m regional fund for investment in environmental infrastructure to support the economy of North West England. This fund has invested in anaerobic digestion, biomass cogeneration assets, and advanced bio waste treatment technologies.  Iona Environmental Infrastructure 3 LP (IEILP 3)  IEILP 3 is being raised with a similar investment mandate and strategy to the previous funds. It carried out a soft close of ¬£90m in Autumn 2016, and will close out at ¬£250m in the next 12 to 18 months. Whilst decarbonising the gas grid through the injection of biomethane remains a cornerstone of the investment strategy, the majority of the fund will be invested in energy from waste projects to promote efficient resource recovery and divert waste from UK land fill.  Strategic Areas of Investment Focus   What is Climate Change?  The issue of climate change is one that has rapidly gained traction in the last ten years as there has been an unprecedented increase in the Earth's temperature. Scientist's argue that the reason behind this involves the trapping of the sun's heat in the Earth's lower atmosphere, due to greenhouse gases in the upper atmosphere re- reflecting heat energy back onto the earth.  Two Degrees of Climate Change  The UK has specific targets which need to be met if the country is going to meet its commitments under the Paris Accords. Whilst the decarbonisation of the UK electricity grid is notable success story, there is still a significant increase in renewable electricity generation capacity required over the next two decades. Much more investment and innovation is required to decarbonise the provision of heat and transport. Iona Capital aims to support these national objectives by investing in environmental infrastructure such as heat networks, energy from waste and anaerobic digestion projects whilst closely monitoring the changing commercial viability of nascent technologies such geothermal heat and power, hydrogen and tidal energy conversion.  Integrated Energy Service Solutions  The integration of renewable technologies and bridging technologies such as natural gas cogeneration provides energy users with cost effective solutions to significantly reduce the carbon intensity of goods and services.  Resource Efficiency and the Circular Economy  A key part of meeting the requirements of the Paris Accords is promoting the move from a linear to a circular economy where resources and energy is reused, recycled and remains within the economic system to a far greater extent. Infrastructure which promotes resource efficiency and the circular economy has the potential to significantly contribute to limiting climate change to Two Degrees.

It is in direct contrast to fixed speed wind turbine where the rotor speed is approximately constant. The reason to vary the rotor speed is to capture the maximum aerodynamic power in the wind, as the wind speed varies. The aerodynamic efficiency, or coefficient of power, C_p for a fixed blade pitch angle is obtained by operating the wind turbine at the optimal tip-speed ratio as shown in the following graph. center Tip-speed ratio is given by the following expression, \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{\\\\omega R}{v} where \\\\omega is the rotor speed (in radians per second), R is the radius of the rotor, and v is the wind speed. As the wind speed varies, the rotor speed must be varied to maintain peak efficiency.  Background  Before the need to connect wind turbines to the grid, turbines were fixed-speed. This was not a problem because turbines did not have to be synchronized with the frequency of the grid. All grid-connected wind turbines, from the first one in 1939 until the development of variable-speed grid-connected wind turbines in the 1970s, were fixed-speed wind turbines. As of 2003, nearly all grid-connected wind turbines operate at an exactly constant speed (synchronous generators) or within a few percents of constant speed (induction generators). P. W. Carlin, A. S. Laxson, and E. B. Muljadi. \\"The History and State of the Art of Variable-Speed Wind Turbine Technology\\". 2003\\\\. p. 130-131.  Torque Rotor- speed diagrams  For a wind turbine, the power harvested is given by the following formula: P = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho\\\\pi R^2 v^3 C_p(\\\\lambda) where P is the aerodynamic power and \\\\rho is the density of the air. The power coefficient is a representation of how much of the available power in the wind is captured by the wind turbine and can be looked up in the graph above. The torque, Q, on the rotor shaft is given by the ratio of the power extracted to the rotor speed: Q = \\\\frac{P}{\\\\omega} Thus we can get the following expressions for torque and power: P = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\lambda^3}\\\\rho\\\\pi R^5 \\\\omega^3 C_p(\\\\lambda) and Q = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\lambda^3}\\\\rho\\\\pi R^5 \\\\omega^2 C_p(\\\\lambda) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\lambda}\\\\rho\\\\pi R^3 v^2 C_p(\\\\lambda) From the above equation, we can construct a torque-speed diagram for a wind turbine. This consists of multiple curves: a constant power curve which plots the relationship between torque and rotor speed for constant power (green curve); constant wind speed curves, which plot the relationship between torque and rotor speed for constant wind speeds (dashed grey curves); and constant efficiency curves, which plot the relationship between torque and rotor speed for constant efficiencies, C_p.https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9781846284922-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-436805-p172423327 This diagram is presented below: center = Notes = Green curve: Plot of power = rated power so that P = Q\\\\omega Grey curve: Wind speed is assumed constant so that Q \\\\propto \\\\omega^2 C_p(\\\\lambda) Blue curve: Constant C_p(\\\\lambda) so that Q \\\\propto \\\\omega^2  Blade forces  For further details, see Blade Element Momentum Theory Consider the following figure: center This is the depiction of the apparent wind speed, as seen by a blade (left of figure). The apparent wind speed is influenced by both the free- stream velocity of the air, and the rotor speed. From this figure, we can see that both the angle \\\\theta and the apparent wind speed W are functions of the rotor speed, \\\\omega. By extension, the lift and drag forces will also be functions of \\\\omega. This means that the axial and tangential forces that act on the blade vary with rotor speed. The force in the axial direction is given by the following formula:  Operating strategies for variable speed wind turbines   Stall regulated  As discussed earlier, a wind turbine would ideally operate at its maximum efficiency for below rated power. Once rated power has been hit, the power is limited. This is for two reasons: ratings on the drivetrain equipment, such as the generator; and second to reduce the loads on the blades. An operating strategy for a wind turbine can thus be divided into a sub-rated-power component, and a rated-power component. = Below rated power = Below rated power, the wind turbine will ideally operate in such a way that C_p = C_{p~max}. On a Torque-rotor speed diagram, this looks as follows: 500px where the black line represents the initial section of the operating strategy for a variable speed stall-regulated wind turbine. Ideally, we would want to stay on the maximum efficiency curve until rated power is hit. However, as the rotor speed increases, the noise levels increase. To counter this, the rotor speed is not allowed to increase above a certain value. This is illustrated in the figure below: 500px = Rated power and above = Once the wind speed has reached a certain level, called rated wind speed, the turbine should not be able to produce any greater levels of power for higher wind speeds. A stall-regulated variable speed wind turbine has no pitching mechanism. However, the rotor speed is variable. The rotor speed can either be increased or decreased by an appropriately designed controller. In reference to the figure illustrated in the blade forces section, it is evident that the angle between the apparent wind speed and the plane of rotation is dependent upon the rotor speed. This angle is termed the angle of attack. The lift and drag co-efficients for an airfoil are related to the angle of attack. Specifically, for high angles of attack, an airfoil stalls. That is, the drag substantially increases. The lift and drag forces influence the power production of a wind turbine. This can be seen from an analysis of the forces acting on a blade as air interacts with the blade (see the following link). Thus, forcing the airfoil to stall can result in power limiting. So it can be established that if the angle of attack needs to be increased to limit the power production of the wind turbine, the rotor speed must be reduced. Again, this can be seen from the figure in the blade forces section. It can also be seen from considering the torque-rotor speed diagram. In reference to the above torque-rotor speed diagram, by reducing the rotor speed at high wind speeds, the turbine enters the stall region, thus bringing some limiting to the power output. 500px  Pitch regulated  Pitch regulation thus allows the wind turbine to actively change the angle of attack of the air on the blades. This is preferred over a stall-regulated wind turbine as it enables far greater control of the power output. = Below rated power = Identical to the stall-regulated variable-speed wind turbine, the initial operating strategy is to operate on the C_{p~max} curve. However, due to constraints such as noise levels, this is not possible for the full range of sub-rated wind speeds. Below the rated wind speed, the following operating strategy is employed: 500px = Above rated power = Above the rated wind speed, the pitching mechanism is employed. This allows a good level of control over the angle of attack, thus control over the torque. The previous torque rotor-speed diagrams are all plots when the pitch angle, \\\\beta, is zero. A three dimensional plot can be produced which includes variations in pitch angle. Ultimately, in the 2D plot, above rated wind speed, the turbine will operate at the point marked 'x' on the diagram below. 500px  Gearboxes  A variable speed may or may not have a gearbox, depending on the manufacturer's desires. Wind turbines without gearboxes are called direct- drive wind turbines. An advantage of a gearbox is that generators are typically designed to have the rotor rotating at a high speed within the stator. Direct drive wind turbines do not exhibit this feature. A disadvantage of a gearbox is reliability and failure rates.http://mragheb.com/Wind%20Power%20Gearbox%20Technologies.pdf An example of a wind turbine without a gearbox is the Enercon E82.http://www.enercon.de/en-en/64.htm  Generators  For variable speed wind turbines, one of two types of generators can be used: a DFIG (doubly fed induction generator) or an FRC (fully rated converter). A DFIG generator draws reactive power from the transmission system; this can increase the vulnerability of a transmission system in the event of a failure. A DFIG configuration will require the generator to be a wound rotor;http://www.4thintegrationconference.com/second/downloads/Anaya%20Trans%20Tutorial%20Talk.pdf squirrel cage rotors cannot be used for such a configuration. A fully rated converter can either be an induction generator or a permanent magnet generator. Unlike the DFIG, the FRC can employ a squirrel cage rotor in the generator; an example of this is the Siemens SWT 3.6-107, which is termed the industry workhorse.http://www.energy.siemens.com/nl/pool/hq/power- generation/renewables/wind- power/wind%20turbines/E50001-W310-A103-V6-4A00_WS_SWT_3_6_107_US.pdf An example of a permanent magnet generator is the Siemens SWT-2.3-113.http://www.energy.siemens.com/us/pool/hq/power-generation/wind- power/E50001-W310-A174-X-4A00_WS_SWT-2.3-113_US.pdf A disadvantage of a permanent magnet generator is the cost of materials that need to be included.http://www.rechargenews.com/wind/article1292870.ece  Grid Connections  Consider a variable speed wind turbine with a permanent magnet synchronous generator. The generator produces AC electricity. The frequency of the AC voltage generated by the wind turbine is a function of the speed of the rotor within the generator: N = \\\\frac{120f}{P} where N is the rotor speed, P is the number of poles in the generator, and f is the frequency of the output Voltage. That is, as the wind speed varies, the rotor speed varies, and so the frequency of the Voltage varies. This form of electricity cannot be directly connected to a transmission system. Instead, it must be corrected such that its frequency is constant. For this, power converters are employed, which results in the de-coupling of the wind turbine from the transmission system. As more wind turbines are included in a national power system, the inertia is decreased. This means that the frequency of the transmission system is more strongly affected by the loss of a single generating unit. = Power converters = As already mentioned, the voltage generated by a variable speed wind turbine is non-grid compliant. In order to supply the transmission network with power from these turbines, the signal must be passed through a power converter, which ensures that the frequency of the voltage of the electricity being generated by the wind turbine is the frequency of the transmission system when it is transferred onto the transmission system. Power converters first convert the signal to DC, and then convert the DC signal to an AC signal. Techniques used include pulse width modulation.

He was a prominent African American abolitionist. Personal life Beman was born in Colchester, Connecticut and later moved to Middletown, Connecticut. His grandfather, Cesar, earned his right to freedom by fighting in the Revolutionary War in place of his master. With his freedom, he took the name Beman, claiming his right to \\"be a man.\\" Cesar was a shoemaker, a trade he passed down to his son Jehiel, who then passed this on to Jehiel's eldest son Leverett. Unlike Leverett, Amos followed a path of study, enrolling in the Oneida Institute, and was destined to enter the ministry. Jehiel Beman, Amos' father, was the first pastor of the Cross Street AME Zion Church in Middletown, CT, and was later pastor of the Boston AME Zion Church. Amos Beman was tutored for a short time by Wesleyan University student Samuel Dole, but was driven from the university by a letter from \\"The Twelve of Us,\\" which threatened his safety. Following this, Beman moved to Hartford, Connecticut to begin his professional career. Throughout his life, Beman followed in the footsteps of his father, Jehiel Beman. In addition to serving as pastor of an African-American church in Connecticut, Jehiel Beman was heavily involved in several social activist movements. His son would lead a similar life. Beman was originally married to a woman named Eunice, with whom he had three sons and two daughters: Mary, Amos, Fannie, Charles, and Emma. However, in 1856, his family was decimated by typhoid fever, which killed his wife and three of his children. A year after these tragedies, Beman remarried Eliza Kennedy, a white woman ‚Äî a decision that drastically undermined his image as pastor of the Temple Street Church. After his second wife died of cancer, Beman married a third time to an African American named Mary Allen,Ancestry.com but for most of his acquaintances, it was too late for Beman to atone for his decision to marry a white woman. Pastoral life In 1841, Beman fulfilled his childhood dream and became pastor of the Temple Street African Church in New Haven, Connecticut. The Temple Street Church was the oldest and most respected African Church in New Haven. Unfortunately, financial difficulties plagued Beman throughout the 17 years that he served the Temple Street Church. Many years, he was unable to take a salary, and he considered resigning from his post on several occasions. Yet, despite these tribulations, Beman's church grew considerably during his time as pastor, adding well over a hundred members to the congregation. Beman was widely recognized as a highly capable pastor, and his followers praised him for his leadership and selflessness. Beman decided to resign as pastor shortly after his second marriage. As pastor of the Temple Street African Church, Beman was a Temperance lecturer, anti-slavery supporter, member of the underground railroad, and an advocate for negro suffrage in Connecticut. Abolitionism and social activism Beman served on multiple conventions and councils that promoted anti-slavery causes and African American civil rights. Notably, Beman was a leading advocate of the African American suffrage movement in Connecticut. Yet, his efforts to grant African Americans the right to vote failed, and he subsequently increased his activity writing for Frederick Douglass' North Star and other African American publications. Beman was known for opening up his church to fugitive slaves, but as the Civil War neared, Beman began traveling around the country, lecturing on the anti- slavery movement. His speeches can be found in many newspapers, including the Emancipator, the Weekly Anglo-African, and the anti-slavery Bugle. Additionally, Beman was a moral activist, highly involved in the temperance movement. He served as president of the Connecticut Society of the Negro Temperance Movement. Beman was also the President of the 1855 Colored National Convention in Philadelphia, held to discuss slavery, suffrage, and moral reform. Beman kept four scrapbooks of articles documenting important moments and ideas he valued. They can be viewed at the Yale library. References  External Links  * Amos Gerry Beman Scrapbooks.

German chronicle of Johann von Posilge and Polish historian Jan D≈Çugosz asserted that Ivan was murdered so that widowed Uliana could marry Vytautas.

However, Anna was sister of Agripina, who was wife of Ivan and mother of Uliana. That made Vytautas uncle-in-law of Uliana. Piotr Krakowczyk, Bishop of Vilnius, refused to perform the wedding ceremony due to this relationship and demanded they seek approval from the pope. Jan Kropid≈Ço, Bishop of W≈Çoc≈Çawek, performed the ceremony before Christmas 1418 and, eventually, Vytautas obtained a matrimonial dispensation from Pope Martin V.

Bax at the UvA Album Academicum website. is a Dutch emeritus (retired in 2002) endowed professor in political anthropology at the Vrije Universiteit (VU University), Amsterdam, the Netherlands. After his retirement he came into prominence to a wider public in the Netherlands in 2012 because of serious suspicions of scientific misconduct. In September 2013 these suspicions were confirmed in an official report. Biography He wrote his dissertation (cum laudeAlbum Academicum Amsterdam University; the Baud-report pag. 31 states erroneously that he received not a cum laude but a ‚Äòwith merit‚Äô) for the University of Amsterdam in 1973 about the anonymized Irish town \\"Patricksville\\".Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by Richard de Boer in Volkskrant April 13 page V3 He further wrote about an anonymized pilgrimage center, called \\"Neerdonk\\" in the Dutch province of North Brabant. He also wrote extensively about the pilgrimage center Medjugorje in the former Yugoslavia. Scientific misconduct The presentation by Bax of the town of \\"Patricksville\\" (presumably Buttevant) as having extensive corruption, bribery, and clientelism is considered controversial among experts.Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by Richard de Boer in Volkskrant April 13 page V5 He claimed in his scientific publications there had been an estimated 140 killings, 60 people missing and 600 refugees from the pilgrimage village Medjugorje, in Bosnia during the Bosnian War (1992‚Äì1995). Bax wrote that he had based his observations on extensive local field research. He called these killing the \\"small war\\". The reason for the killings in 1991/1992 were according to Bax not ethnic conflict but a vendetta between clans. Apart from very local writings near Medjugorje these claims were first criticized in journalistic writings in 2008. In April 2013 at latest both the existence of the mass killing, missing people, and refugees turned to out to be false beyond reasonable doubt.http://www.vu.nl/nl/nieuws-agenda/nieuws/2013/jan-mrt/VU- onderzoekt-werk-emeritus-hoogleraar-Mart-Bax.asp In October 2012 the Dutch book Ontspoorde Wetenschap (Engl.: \\"Derailed science\\") by the science journalist Frank van Kolfschooten was published. In the book Van Kolfschooten pointed to the lack of confirmation for the vendetta. Bax had published anonymized results about field research that he stated to have done in a monastery in the province of North Brabant, the Netherlands. Van Kolfschooten had doubts about the existence of the monastery, because the existence of the monastery could not be confirmed by experts and because Bax refused to tell anyone in confidence the name and the location of the monastery. The writings by Van Kolfschooten were largely based on the unpublished work of Dr. Peter Jan Margry of the Meertens institute.'Ik kon begin jaren negentig al geen chocola van Bax' verhaal maken' by Patrick Meershoek in Het Parool September 24, 2013 page 4http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Nederland/article/detail/3337170/2012/10/25/Hoogleraar- Politieke-Antropologie-VU-verzon-mogelijk-klooster.dhtml The Free University, Amsterdam, reacted by announcing an investigation to Bax's works.http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2012/10/25/academici-frauderen-vaker-dan- instituten-meldden/ The Dutch Volkskrant newspaper wrote in April 2013 that Bax's scientific writings about the Bosnian pilgrimage site Medjugorje contained many important incorrect citations to local writings or to non- existing local writings.Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by Richard de Boer in Volkskrant April 13 page V5 Bax also incorrectly stated that the resident register was destroyed during the Bosnian war.Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by Richard de Boer in Volkskrant April 13 page V2 The Volkskrant also wrote in the same lengthy article that approximately one third of the scientific publications that Bax had submitted in the internal database, called Metis, of the university does not exist.Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by Richard de Boer in Volkskrant April 13 page V5 The Volkskrant accuses him of fraud.Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by Richard de Boer in Volkskrant April 13 page V5 A commission to investigate this possible scientific misconduct was chaired by Michiel Baud and published its findings in a report dated September 9, 2013, and made public September 23, 2013.\\"Commissie-Baud onderzoekt beschuldiging wetenschapsfraude\\".

Bax\\" .\\"College van Bestuur VU onderschrijft conclusies onderzoekscommissie Baud\\". VU nieuws, September 23, 2013. The commission confirmed serious misconduct: *Both in the Neerdonk case as well as in Medjugorje, Bax stated to have relied on one single local informant who told him improbable stories about public events that were not confirmed by anyone else. And Bax did not do any effort to check these stories. Bax wrote down the stories of these two alleged informants with certainty and in detail as if these they were historical facts. The commission considered this methodology scientifically irresponsible and a case of serious scientific misconduct. The commission considered these stories likely to be invented either by Bax or the informants. The commission was unable to interview these two informants, because one has died and the other one could not be found. So the most serious scientific misconduct accusation i.e. data fabrication by Bax could not be proved. * Of the 161 publications claimed by Bax, 64 are non-existent. He signed off his yearly publication list, so this makes it a crime of written misrepresentation. This is fraud against his employer.Michiel Baud, Susan Leg√™ne, and Peter Pels (September 9, 2013). \\"Draaien om de werkelijkheid: Rapport over het antropologisch werk van prof. em. M.M.G.

Margry contacted Bax and received replies from Bax that did not remove his doubts.Meershoek, Patrick in Parool newspaper, 24 Sept 2013 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BU9DgvBCAAEwbZB.jpg:large https://www.meertens.knaw.nl/cms/files/Schermafbeelding%202013-09-27%20om%2016_58_05.png In 2008 the Frankfurter Rundschau did not receive a reply from Bax about the fact that he could not have observed in Medjugorje what he claimed to have observed. In 2012 Van Kolfschooten did not receive a reply to the letters that he sent to Bax. In April 2013 Bax wrote to the Volkskrant the following.Het Kaartenhuis van hoogleraar Bax by Richard de Boer in Volkskrant April 13 page V3 *Regarding the vendetta between clans in Medjugorje that Bax called \\"little war\\". This was due to a mistake that close colleagues warned him about in 1995 in which he confused Yugoslavia during World War II (1941‚Äì1945) with the Bosnian war (1991‚Äì1995). He stated that he had tried in vain to correct his mistake with a rectification in a second edition. The second edition never came however. He did not explain why he kept publishing about the \\"little war\\" for years after the end of the Bosnian war in 1995.Door: Richard de Boer en Maarten Keulemans ‚àí 13/04/13, 05:56 Veldstudie VU-antropoloog Bax zit vol onwaarheden. See also the complete letter from Bax linked to in that article. *Bax had written that the resident register had been destroyed during the Bosnian war. This is untrue. Bax explained this by stating that a key informant had told him that he did not need to do any effort to check the killings in the \\"little war\\". Bax admitted that in hindsight, he should have done more. *Bax referred in his writings to a newspaper Mostarski List which never existed. According to Bax, this was not a newspaper but a secret pamphlet. *Regarding the missing inhabitants due to the little war, Bax stated that he had seen vacated homes. In 2013 the Baud committee spoke three times with Bax. In addition to the explanations to the Volkskrant, Bax said that he had written down improbable alleged historical events with certainty to make his articles accessible to readers. He stated that he had followed in this respect the example of Norbert Elias. In September 2013 Bax did not reply to the report of the Baud committee.http://www.advalvas.vu.nl/nieuws/%E2%80%98ernstig-wetenschappelijk- wangedrag%E2%80%99-van-antropoloog-bax Bax's selected 'scientific' publications * Harpstrings and confessions : an anthropological study of politics in rural Ireland, 1973, dissertation * Figurational Analysis: A Better Perspective for Networkers.

He won nine of his thirteen races in a racing career which lasted from October 1836 until October 1838. Mango was well-beaten in his only race as a two-year-old and finished unplaced in The Derby but won three races at Royal Ascot in June. In September he won an exceptionally rough race for the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse and then won the Newmarket equivalent a month later. Mango won twice in the following year, but became increasingly temperamental and difficult to manage. He was retired to stud at the end of 1838 but proved a failure as a sire. Background Mango was a powerfully-built, dark-coated brown horse with a small white star who stood 15 hands, three and a half inches high. According to the New Sporting Magazine he was an honest, but lazy horse who required \\"considerable exertion on the part of his jockey\\" to show his best form. According to the General Stud Book he was bred by Charles Greville although other sources state that he was bred by Thomas Thornhill and then sold to Greville. Mango's sire, Emilius, won the Derby in 1823 and went on to become a successful stallion at the Riddlesworth stud which was owned and run by Thomas Thornhill. Apart from Preserve, Emilius‚Äôs best winners included Priam, Plenipotentiary, Oxygen, Riddlesworth (2000 Guineas) and Preserve: he was British Champion sire in 1830 and 1831. Mango's dam Mustard, a daughter of the Oaks winner Morel was bred and owned by Thornhill. She showed some racing ability, finishing third in the Prendergast Stakes as a two-year-old, before becoming a successful broodmare. In addition to Mango, her fifth foal, she produced his full-sister Preserve, and is regarded as the Foundation mare of Thoroughbred family 1-c. Mango was originally trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by Richard Prince, but later moved to the stable of Montgomery Dilly. Racing career 1836: two-year-old season Mango made his first racecourse appearance in the Clearwell Stakes at Newmarket on 18 October. He was not among the favourites and finished unplaced behind Colonel Peel's chestnut filly who won from the future 1000 Guineas winner Chapeau d'Espagne. 1837: three-year-old season On 11 April 1837, Mango was scheduled to begin his second season in a sweepstakes over Newmarket's Ditch Mile course. When the other horses were withdrawn by their owners however, Mango was allowed to walk over the course to claim the prize. On 25 May, Mango was one of seventeen runners to contest the fifty-eighth running of the Derby Stakes at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Despite the fact that he had finished unplaced in his only competitive race, Mango was strongly supported in the betting and started the 11/2 third favourite but finished unplaced behind the 40/1 outsider Phosphorus. On 6 June Mango was matched against Chapeau d'Espagne in the Ascot Derby. He started the 6/4 favourite, took the lead after a mile and won by a length won from Edgar, with the 1000 Guineas winner in third place. Later the same day, Mango won a plate donated by the King when he defeated Velure, a filly owned by Lord Exeter Two days later, Mango won his third race of the meeting when he beat Rat-Trap in a sweepstakes over the Old Mile course. On 30 June he appeared at Stockbridge Racecourse where he defeated Wisdom in a one and a half mile match. On 19 September Mango, ridden by the teenager Sam Day, was one of thirteen three-year-olds to contest the Great St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. He started the 13/2 fourth choice in the betting behind Epirus, Mahometan and Cardinal Puff. The race appears to have been an eventful one. Shortly after the start Epirus slipped and fell into a ditch at the side of the course, seriously injuring his jockey Bill Scott, who suffered a compound fracture of the collar bone. Sam Day tracked the leaders on Mango, but approaching the final furlong he seemed unlikely to figure in the finish when a greyhound ran onto the course, impeding two of the leaders. In the closing stages, Mango was driven through a gap in the leading rank, settled the race in three strides and won by a length Mr Fairlie's colt Abraham Newland. The result was enthusiastically received by the large and unruly crowd. Both Greville and his associate Lord George Bentinck were reported to have won ¬£10,000 on the race. Fifteen days after his classic victory, Mango (having returned from Yorkshire in a horse-drawn \\"van\\") started 4/6 favourite for Newmarket's version of the St Leger, despite having sustained a minor injury a few days before the race. Ridden by John Barham Day he appeared beaten in the closing stages but produced a strong finish to win by half a length from Troilus, with Rat-trap third and Dardanelles fourth. The forty- four-year-old Day was reported to be \\"dreadfully exhausted by his exertions\\" on the winner. After the race there were insinuations that Mango's connections had exaggerated the severity of his injury in order to obtain better odds, but nothing was proved. Mango's run of six consecutive wins came to an end at the next Newmarket meeting when he failed to concede fourteen pounds to Velure in the Garden Stakes. On the same day, Greville received a forfeit when Mr Greatrex's colt failed to appear for a 300 guinea match against Mango over the five furlongs. 1838: four-year-old season Mango began his four-year-old season at the Craven meeting in April when his owner received a 100 guinea forfeit as George Osbaldeston's Mahometan failed to appear for a two-mile match. Three days later at the same meeting Mango won the Claret Stakes, easily beating Hibiscus, his only opponent, by three lengths. At the next Newmarket meeting Mango won a sweepstakes over the four-mile Beacon Course, but again gave John Barham Day a difficult time, dodging, swerving and \\"rebeling\\" against the jockey before winning by two lengths. Later at the same meering he failed to appear for a match against Velure, leaving Greville to pay a 150 guinea forfeit. After a break of five months, Mango returned to action at the First October meeting but he failed to add to his successes, being beaten by Lord Suffield's mare Arsenic in a five furlong match. He was entered in a match against Lord Suffield's Caravan at the Second October meeting, but was withdrawn by Greville and retired to stud. Stud record Mango began his career as a breeding stallion at Hampton Court Paddocks where he stood at a fee of 11 guineas a mare. Mango's stud record was very disappointing as he sired no major winners and few horses of any consequence. One of his sons, Portumnus, won three races for Greville at Newmarket in 1843, but two of these were walkovers.

In 1815, he wrote a journal of his travels through the trans- Mississippi West in the early 19th century. Researchers have discovered that the Maley journal that has been housed at Yale University for nearly 200 years is the second half of a larger work. The first half was found in a rare book shop in Philadelphia and acquired in 2012 by Southern Methodist University.

The story is continued and completed in the volume at the Yale library. Maley's work is not entirely unknown to historians, due to the partial journal in Yale's Silliman papers and a better- known journal (also part of the Silliman collection) on the Texas Iron, the largest collected meteorite in the world for most of the 19th century and still the largest preserved find from Texas.Flores, Dan L. \\"Texas Iron,\\" Handbook of Texas Online. Retrieved April 22, 2013. However, scholarly opinion has been divided on the Yale journal's authenticity due to the lack of knowledge about Maley himself. William H. Goetzmann writes in Exploration and Empire: ‚ÄúMy account of Maley‚Äôs incredible and hitherto unknown adventures is based on his own manuscript journal, purchased for Yale by Professor Benjamin Silliman. So obscure a figure is Maley that it has been impossible to check the veracity of his account on all points. The reader is therefore warned to accept his story only on the most tentative basis, subject to confirmation or denial by further detailed research.\\"Goetzmann, William H. Exploration and Empire: The Explorer and the Scientist in the Winning of the American West, pp. 54-55 Some of the mystery surrounding Maley can be explained by his own solitary nature. Michael Brown writes: \\"Maley was a classic loner, often traveling by himself, or at most with one other person. His solo travels across the remotest portions of America were greeted with incredulity by scholars; now teenagers sailing alone around the world are almost commonplace. A wanderer, he was often out in the wilderness when census or other records were being compiled. There is a paucity of documentary evidence concerning Maley‚Äôs travels. However when checking such records for people Maley encountered on his travels, census records confirm Maley‚Äôs often detailed accounts of exactly how many individuals were in a given household or establishment.\\" The Maley journal represents the four millionth volume added to the SMU libraries. The university chose 2013 as \\"The Year of the Library\\" to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1913 creation of SMU's first library, the hiring of its first librarian and the acquisition of its first book.

Etymology Cagliari, west walls and tower at dawn Cagliari was known to the Phoenicians and Carthaginians as Karaly (, ). This was Latinized variously as Carales, Karales, Caralis, and Calares (grammatically plural). Around the 16th century Roderigo Hunno Baeza, a Sardinian humanist, stated that the name \\"Caralis\\" had derived from the Greek k√°rs (, \\"head\\"), as Cagliari was the main centre of the island. The Semitist William Gesenius said the name came from Kar Baalis, which in Phoenician meant \\"city of God.\\" This version was, albeit with some differences, accepted by Giovanni Spano, who claimed that Cagliari derived from the Phoenician name Kar-El,[32] which also means \\"city of God.\\" Max Leopold WagnerM. L. Wagner, La lingua sarda, storia, spirito e forma, A. Francke, Bern, 1951, again published by Ilisso, Nuoro, 1997 traced the term to Protosardinian Karalis, reflecting the Sardinian place names of Carale (Austis), Carallai (Sorradile), Karhalis or Karhallis (Carallia) of Pamphylia and Karhalleia of Pisidia (Turkey). The toponym Karalis was connected with such words as cacarallai, criallei, crielle, chirelle, ghirelle (wild chrysanthemum [33] and Macerone) and garuleu, galureu, Galileu (pollen deposited in honey, which is yellow gold), which has affinity with the Etruscan garouleou (wild chrysanthemum). Francesco Artizzu noticed that the root \\"kar\\" in the languages of the Mediterranean peoples meant \\"stone/rock\\" and the suffix \\"al/ar\\" gave collective value, so the word Karali could be translated as \\"place of the rock community\\" or simply \\"rocky place.\\" As for the plural, Kalares, Artizzu explained that an initial settlement core was joined by other neighboring nuclei, thus increasing the extent of the city. In conclusion, Karalis/Caralis originally most likely had the meaning of \\"place of community on the rock/yellow or white rock\\". Cagliari map 1858 Over time the judicial city became the center of what is now the neighborhood of Santa Gilla or Stampace, and in medieval Sardinian was thus called Santa Igia. With the arrival of Pisans the city was identified in the documents as Kastrum Karalis and later by the Catalan-Aragonese as Castell de Caller in Catalan. Then on adoption of the Spanish language during Spanish rule the name became Callari and finally in the Savoy period the name was simply transliterated into Italian, obtaining the current Cagliari. In the Sardinian language the current name Casteddu identifies the city with the city's fortified castle built during the rule of Pisa. Other scholars think that the name Casteddu is much older, going back to the very beginnings of Roman rule, and is nothing but the translation into Latin of popular Karalis. The two place names survived, the one as the official name of the Municipium (municipality) until today, the other as a literal translation of the Latin which became prevalent in common parlance when pre-Latin languages became extinctin the city and throughout the whole island. An extant fragment by Varro Atacinus, a Latin poet of the 1st century BC mentions: munitus Vicus Caralis, meaning \\"fortified town of Caralis\\", Castellum in popular Latin. In any case, the word Casteddu is the direct descendant of the Latin castellum and not a loan from the dialect of Pisa as might suggest the \\"refounding\\" of the fortified medieval city. Furthermore, at that time the hill of the castle was named Monti Castru; castru is a Sardinian word that descends from Latin Castrum (military encampment, fort or castle) and means \\"jagged mountaintop\\". A local Renaissance writer, Roderigo Hunno Baeza, describes the Roman city, from the ruins that still remained in his time, as an Arx on the hill, from which the Via Sacra descended to the port.Roderigo Hunno Baeza, Caralys Panegyricus, manuscript in Cagliari University Library (16th century)F. Barreca, La civilt√† fenicio punica in Sardegna, Carlo Delfino Editore, Sassari 1988Dionogi Scano, Forma Karalis, edizioni 3T, 1989Mauro Podda, La Sardegna e il faggio- Sardegna Antica n¬∞ 30 In conclusion, having no certain etymology for the name Cagliari, it probably refers to the naturally fortified hill overlooking the harbor, the main outlet of the southern Campidano plain. The Greek geographer Ptolemy, who lived in the second century A.D., wrote ŒöŒ¨œÅŒ±ŒªŒπœÇ œÄœåŒªŒπœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÑŒ∫œÅŒ±, literally \\"town and fortress of Caralis\\". The very reason for the existence of this ancient city lies in its being both a powerful military structure to defend the main port of southern Sardinia and a basis for control of the western Mediterranean, as well as the outlet for the grain-growing region and livestock products (cheese, leather), iron, lead, copper and zinc mining from the inland, and of course, the salt that was produced at the great saltworks that surround it. Prehistory Monte Claro civilization cruise Some Domus de Janas and the remains of huts of the IV - III millennium B.C. discovered in Saint Bartholomew zone on the hill of St. Elias, confirm that the area where the city today stands has been inhabited since Neolithic times. The resources of the sea, ponds, and partly rocky land suitable for cereal and some horticultural crops ensured the livelihood of the people during the peaceful pre-nuraghic period. Artefacts from the Monte Claro culture go back to the Copper Age and spread throughout the island, which takes its name from the eponymous hill of Cagliari.Giovanni Lilliu, La civilt√† dei Sardi dal Paleolitico all'et√† dei Nuraghi \\"Nuoro\\" 2003- Archaeological finds from the Bronze Age, such as Aegean pottery found in the nuraghes of Antigori Sarroch, inspired the hypothesis that the Nuragicals settled in Cagliari, entertained intense commercial and cultural ties with the Mycenaeans, and are a testimony that their ports were already vital and busy. Inside the urban area no nuraghic building was found until 2012, when in Monte Claro some ruins of a sacred well were discovered. All around the city, east and west, there are nuraghes, giants' graves and sacred wells. Phoenician colony and Punic era Necropolis of Tuvixeddu National Archeological Museum Krly or Karel started as a store or trading post around the tenth century BC when the Phoenicians began to frequent the area of the Gulf of the Angels. A passage in the De Bello Gildonico of Claudian, who described it in the fourth century AD, says that Cagliari was founded by powerful Tyre, a city of the Lebanon, which in the early centuries of the first millennium BC experienced its most prosperous period as a commercial power between the eastern and western Mediterranean, and also founded the city of Carthage. That was the thalassocracy of Tyre.Sextus Pompeius Festus, De verborum significatu, (Tyria maria) The first nucleus of Phoenician Cagliari seems to have been near the pond of Santa Gilla, but gradually the city center moved more and more to the east until it reached approximately the point where today's Piazza del Carmine is located. During the Punic era, from the end of the 6th century B.C., the city took on the appearance of an authentic urban center and many temples were built, including one dedicated to the goddess Astarte, near the promontory of St. Elias. The town had two cemeteries, a northwestern one corresponding to the necropolis of Tuvixeddu, considered the largest Phoenician necropolis in the Mediterranean, and a southeastern one located on the hill of Bonaria, while the Tophet, the cremation necropolis where the urns of children were deposited, was in an area now called Campo Scipione-San Paolo. Roman era Is centu scalas, (\\"a hundred steps\\"), the Roman amphitheatre of Cagliari Saint Eulalia church Roman Orpheus mosaic from Cagliari Bacchus statue find in a western city part villa Caralis on the ancient Roman map Tabula Peutingeriana Having become the island's now completely punicized main town, Krly became Roman in 238 BC when Sardinia and Corsica were occupied by the army of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus in 238 BC, in the aftermath of the First Punic War. The appearance of the town does not seem to have changed much during the long first period of Roman domination. In the following centuries Roman Karalis retained its role as a Sardinian metropolis. On the death of Caesar citizens remained faithful to his name and sided with his adopted son Octavian Augustus, first against Sextus Pompey, then against Antonio. After the victory of Octavian there was a long period of political calm and economic boom. Caralis (or Karales) was the capital of the Roman province of Sardinia and Corsica and was elevated to the rank of Municipium, a result of the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey when Caesar himself granted this status in gratitude to the city for its fidelity during the bloody war. All Caralitani obtained Roman citizenship and were enrolled in the tribe Quirina. The territory of the city included the campidano plain, likely becoming Sanluri.Attilio Mastino (a cura di), Storia della Sardegna antica, Il Maestrale, Nuoro,2005 Karalitan ship owners and traders, on a mosaic found in Ostia (the port of ancient Rome) Salt pans, the oldest resource-exploiting industry of Cagliari With about 20,000 inhabitants Caralis was the largest and most populous city of the island and the most important of the western Mediterranean basin of the Republic, and later of the Roman Empire. The city was equipped with important road links to the main towns of the island such as Sulki, with the coastal road and with that running through the valley of the Cixerri, Olbia and Tibula along the east coast, and Turris and Tibula along the road modeled on the current Carlo Felice, and finally a road through the centre of the island to the north coast.Itinerarium provinciarum Antonini Augusti, edited by Peter Wesseling, Amsterdam, 1735, pag.84 The town was also equipped with an amphitheater capable of seating approximately 10,000 spectators, temples, villas and aqueducts that supplied water, sourcing maybe from Domusnovas and Caput Aquas, near Iglesias. But the city was also endowed since the Punic time with numerous and large cisterns dug into the rock to collect rainwater and which can be seen today in various parts of the city. There were at least three cemeteries, one that was the same Punic necropolis of Tuvixeddu, another in the area around the churches of St. Lucifer and San Saturn, and Bonaria hill, and a third along the current Viale Regina Margherita, the burial site of the classiari or detachment of sailors of the fleet of Misenum, which was based at the city port. Along the main road out of the city to Turris, near the Punic necropolis, a mausoleum tomb dedicated to Attilia Pomptilla was built by her husband, Philip Cassio. Known as Viper's Cave, it is decorated with an impressive cycle of Greek and Latin CARMINA that can be considered the first literary work produced in Sardinia and surviving to the present day, the beginning of the literary history of the island. Among the main economic activities, a primary industry was salt mining from brine at a site between Caralis and Quartu, still undertaken today. This salt as well as grain, leather (tanned in establishments found near the port) and other products made in Sardinia were exported to other provinces of the empire. In the Roman period, although administered by the prefect of the province, the city maintained institutions of Carthaginian origin, such as the Sufeti, magistrates that were elected annually until the time of the granting of the \\"municipium\\" status. On that occasion, according to some researchers,Piero Meloni, La Sardegna romana, Chiarella, Sassari, 1990 a coin was minted with the names of the last two sufeti of the city. For the historian Florus, who lived between the first and second century AD, Caralis was already the city of cities of SardiniaLucius Annaeus Florus, De Chorographia Bellorum omnium annorum DCC, Libri II, Epit. XXII, 35urbemque urbium Caralim in times of Punic Wars, and for the geographer Pomponius Mela, who lived in the first century, it was already a very old town.Pomponius Mela, De Chorographia, Liber II, 108, urbium antiquissimae Caralis Claudian described the City of Caralis in the fourth century AD: > Caralis, extends in length and flows among the waves on a small hill that > breaks the opposing wind. In the middle of the sea as a port and a large > shelter, protected from all winds, calm down the lagoon watersUrbs Lybiam > contra Tyrio fundata potenti/Tenditur in longum Caralis, tenuemque per > undas/Obvia dimittit fracturum flamina collem./Efficitur portus medium mare: > tutaque ventis/Omnibus, ingenti mansuescunt stagna recessu.(Claudius > Claudianus, I, 520, 4th century) Claudian describes the ancient city as extending to a considerable length towards the promontory or headland, the projection of which sheltered its port; the latter affords good anchorage for large vessels. But besides this, which is only a well-sheltered roadstead, a large saltwater lake adjoins the city. This lagoon, called the Stagno di Cagliari, communicates with the bay by a narrow channel, and appears according to Claudian to have been used in ancient times as an inner harbor or basin.Claud. B. Gild. 520-24. The promontory adjoining the city is evidently that noticed by Ptolemy (), but the Caralitanum Promontorium of Pliny can be no other than the headland, now called Capo Carbonara, which forms the eastern boundary of the Gulf of Cagliari and the southeast point of the whole island. Immediately off it lay the little island of Ficaria,Pliny l. c.; Ptolemy iii. 3. ¬ß 8. now called the Isola dei Cavoli. A Christian community is attested in Cagliari at least as early as the 3rd century, and by the end of that century the city had a Christian bishop. In the middle decades of the 4th century bishop Lucifer of Cagliari was exiled because of his opposition to the Arian belief. He was banished to the desert of Thebais by the emperor Constantius.Sozomen, Ecclesiastical History, 3.15 and 5.12 Vandal domination In 456 the city fell under the occupation of the Vandals of Africa, led by Genseric. Caralis was part of the kingdom of the Vandals for about eighty years, and became for a short time the capital of an independent Sardinian kingdom proclaimed by the Visigoth noble and Vandal governor of Sardinia, Godas. Byzantine era Saint Saturnus Basilica Sardinia was conquered by the Romans of the East under Emperor Justinian I in 534 AD. An expedition led by Belisarius defeated the Vandals and Cagliari entered the Byzantine administrative system as the seat of the ·ºÑœÅœáœâŒΩ (archon), the provincial governor, an imperial official in charge of the whole of Sardinia (Œ£Œ±œÅŒ¥Œ∑ŒΩŒØŒ±) and subject to the Exarchate of Africa. During the Gothic War, which raged in the peninsula, Goths occupied the city for a short time before it was given back into Byzantine hands. In 599 AD, the fleet of the Lombard Agilulfo raided and plundered the coasts of Cagliari, but was finally repulsed by local militias. In the year 753 AD, Arab sources report the imposition of the jizya, a tax for those not converted to Islam, the dhimmi, on the Sardinians. This presumes the occupation of the land on which it is imposed, but the lack of further sources suggests ephemeral occupation and control confined to some coastal regions. On this occasion, however, the Arabs could have imposed the dismantling of the defenses of the city. When in 827 the Muslim conquest of Sicily began, contacts with Constantinople became extremely difficult. The few available sources suggest that the richest and most influential family of the island began to take over the local government. Although a vassal of the Byzantines, so that even at the beginning of the eleventh century its rulers still boasted the title of imperial protospatharios, Sardinia was in fact independent. Cagliari became the capital of this independent kingdom or giudicato, ruled by a judice (literally \\"judge\\" or magistrate). However, there is some evidence that during this period of independence from external rule the city was reduced to a small port community because it was too exposed to attacks from the sea by Moorish pirates. Apparently many people left Caralis and founded a new town (named Santa Igia) in an area close to the Santa Gilla swamp to the west of Cagliari, but relatively distant from the sea. At the present state of research, the site of historic Santa Gilla has not yet been identified, because it was completely destroyed by the Pisans in the thirteenth century. The walls were dismantled, as well as the cathedral and the palace of the judice. After the failed attempt at conquest of Sardinia by the Spanish Muslim MujƒÅhid al- øƒÄmirƒ´ in about 1016, the kingdom was divided into four giudicati, one of which was named Callaris, in reference to its capital, now modern Cagliari. The Judicatus of Cagliari comprised a large area of the Campidano plain, the mineral resources of the Sulcis region, and the mountain region of Ogliastra. There were three other independent and autonomous giudicati in Sardinia: the Logudoro (or Torres) in the northwest, the Gallura in the northeast, and in the east the most famous, the long-lived Giudicato of Arborea, with Oristano as its capital. Judicatus of Cagliari Cresia de Santu Perdu de is Piscadoris - Saint Peter of Fishermen church of Santa Gilla city in Cagliari Casteddu de Santu Miali - Saint Michael Castle In 1089, Constantine Salusio de Lacon appeared with the title of rex et iudex Caralitanus (\\"King and Judge of Cagliari\\"). During the 11th century, the Republic of Pisa began to extend its political influence over the Giudicato of Cagliari. Pisa and the maritime republic of Genoa had a keen interest in Sardinia because it was a perfect strategic base for controlling the commercial routes between Italy and North Africa. In 1215 the Pisan Lamberto Visconti, giudice of Gallura, obtained by force from the Torchitorio IV of Cagliari and his wife Benedetta the mountain located east of Santa Igia. Soon (1216/1217) Pisan merchants founded on this mount a new fortified city to be known as \\"Castel di Castro\\", which can be considered the ancestor of the modern city of Cagliari. Some of the fortifications that still surround the current district of Castello (Casteddu 'e susu in the Sardinian language) were built by the Pisans, most notably the two remaining white limestone towers designed by the architect Giovanni Capula (originally there were three towers guarding the three gates that gave access to the district). Together with the district of Castello, Castel di Castro comprised the districts of Marina (which included the port) and the later Stampace and Villanova. Marina and Stampace were guarded by walls, while Villanova, which mainly hosted peasants, was not. The location of the capital of the Judicatus, Santa Igia, is still unknown. A hypothesis identifies it in a place now called Fangario on the far outskirts of the modern city, but the most recent hypothesis locates it around the modern Corso Vittorio Emanuele, significantly referred to in the Sardinian language as \\"Su Brugu,\\" the burg. The only building of the era that still exists is near the Corso: the church of Saint Peter Fisherman. All the other buildings, the palace, churches, houses and walls were demolished by the Pisans and their foundations are now below the modern city, as are the Punic, Roman and Byzantine ruins that appear here and there under the modern houses. Pisan domination The impressive mediaeval Elephant Tower Pisan lion in the cathedral In 1258 after the defeat of William III, the last giudice of Cagliari, the Pisans and their Sardinian allies (Arborea, Gallura and Logudoro) destroyed the old capital of Santa Igia. The Giudicato of Cagliari was divided into three parts: the northwest third went to Gallura; the centre was incorporated into Arborea; the region of Sulcis and Iglesiente in the south-west was given to the Pisan della Gherardesca family, while the Republic of Pisa maintained the control over its colony of Castel di Castro. But after the battle of Meloria (1284), won by Genoa, the power of Pisa began to decline: Pisa lost Corsica, and although the republic kept control of a large part of Sardinia, its pro-imperial policy placed it in opposition to the Pope, who decided to give the island to the Aragonese kings in 1298, granting them the title of King of Sardinia and Corsica. Pisa responded by assuming direct control of the territories controlled as manor by Pisan citizens and increasingly reinforced the defenses of the island and in particular those of the Castle of Cagliari. In fact, only in 1324 did the Aragonese organized the invasion of Pisan Sardinia. With a large fleet coming from Barcelona and Valencia they landed in the south-west of the island and poceeded to besiege Cagliari. After a few months the Pisans capitulated and surrendered to the King of Aragon. At that time the Kingdom of Sardinia was born and Cagliari became its capital. Conquest by the King of Aragon  Gothic Aragonese chapel in the cathedral Bars of Aragon In 1324 the Kingdom of Aragon conquered Cagliari (Castel di Castro) after a battle against the Pisans. When Sardinia was finally conquered by the Catalan- Aragonese army, Cagliari (Castel de C√†ller or simply C√†ller in Catalan) became the administrative capital of the newborn Kingdom of Sardinia, one of the many kingdoms forming the Crown of Aragon, which later came under the rule of the Spanish Empire. Since 1326, the city, having expelled the Pisans and been repopulated by Catalans, Valencians and Aragonese, began a new period of development, soon interrupted by the war between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Judicatus of Arborea. The war lasted, with ups and downs, from the mid-14th century to 1420, with the Judicatus full debellatio. During this long period, the city, along with the city of Alghero, was often the Aragonese monarchs' only garrison on the island and it never fell into the hands of Arborences. The kings of Aragon, and later the kings of Spain (who were also Kings of Sardinia), were represented in Cagliari by a viceroy. The city was enclosed in strong fortifications and its architecture was oriented towards the late Catalan Gothic style. Spanish Habsburg era Old Baroque fa√ßade of Cagliari Cathedral El Forastero View of ancient Cagliari With the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, Cagliari and the whole of Sardinia were bound more and more to the nascent Spanish state. The Catalan language was the official language of the Cortes of the Kingdom, but its active use gradually died out in the city, overwhelmed by Sardinian in everyday use in every social class, even in the nobility, and it was replaced by Spanish as the language of culture and government. The city remained the capital of the kingdom and the most wealthy and populous city, with its status of royal and autonomous city. In it the Viceroy lived, the Cortes, the Parliament, was called every ten years, the Royal Audience, the supreme judiciary, met. Besides being the main export centre for Sardinian goods, its port was an inevitable staging point in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean routes to the Iberian peninsula. It was equipped with a powerful defense system of ramparts and bastions, which transformed it into the key stronghold for controlling the western Mediterranean. In 1535 it received the visit of Emperor Charles V, right in the town harbor, where he gathered an impressive fleet with the aim to win over Tunisia. Cultural life was vibrant, far from provincial, perfectly integrated in the cultural atmosphere of Habsburg Europe. Here were born or lived people of high caliber such as Sigismund Arquer, scholar, theologian, jurist and geographer, who died at the stake in Toledo, charged with being a Lutheran;Sardiniae brevis historia et descriptio.

XXXI There was also a renowned school of painting known as \\"Stampace\\" from the name of the urban district where the shops were, which had its major representatives in Peter Cavaro, the son of Michael, Peter Raxis the elder, and Antiochus Mainas. In 1607 the University was established, as was the first public hospital. But the decadence that the Spanish Empire experienced in the second half of the seventeenth century also damaged the city and exposed it to a serious outbreak of plague in 1656, from which came by municipal vow the Feast of Sant'Efisio, still the most important religious event of the island. 18th century Entrance of the Royal Palace 18th century Saint Anne church In 1718, after the brief rule of the Austrian Habsburgs, the Savoy dynasty obtained the Kingdom of Sardinia, which remained an autonomous institution in relation to the mainland states of the dynasty and solemnly swore to respect the ancient customs and privileges. But the eighteenth century was the era of absolute monarchies, and the new ruling house gradually transformed the old kingdom created by the medieval Aragonese kings into one best suited to the needs of the new times. In order not to convene the parliament, the rulers did not increase the donativo, the taxes collected for the sovereign. For half a century Spanish remained the official language. The formal capital was Cagliari, but now all decisions were made at the court of Turin, residence of the monarchs. Nevertheless, the city slowly grew and benefitted from the Age of Enlightenment, with the reorganization of the university, the strengthening of the defense system, the restructuring of the Royal Palace, and access to the markets of central and northern Italy and Europe. In the late 18th century during the Napoleonic wars France tried to conquer Cagliari because of its strategic role in the Mediterranean Sea. A French army landed on Poetto Beach and advanced towards Cagliari, but was defeated by Sardinians who defended themselves against the revolutionary army. People from Cagliari hoped to receive some concession from the Savoys in return for their defense of the town. For example, aristocrats from Cagliari asked for a Sardinian representative in the parliament of the kingdom. When the Savoys refused any concession to the Sardinians, inhabitants of Cagliari rose up against the Savoys and expelled all representatives of the kingdom and people from Piedmont. This insurgence is celebrated in Cagliari during the \\"Die de sa Sardigna\\" (Sardinian Day) on the last weekend of April. However, the Savoys regained control of the town after a brief period of autonomous rule. Modern era Triumphal Arch King Umberto I, better known as the Bastione of St Remy Neo-gothic city hall Via Roma porched avenue Fascist era tribunal palace From the 1870s, with the unification of Italy, the city experienced a century of rapid growth. The ancient medieval and 16th century walls were dismantled, wide avenues were opened and a rational urban plan was designed. Many outstanding buildings were erected by the end of the 19th century during the office of Mayor Ottone Bacaredda. Many of these buildings combined influences from Art Nouveau together with the traditional Sardinian taste for floral decoration; an example is the white marble City Hall near the port. Ottone Bacaredda is also famous for the violent repression of one of the earliest worker strikes in the beginning of the 20th century. In 1807 the first lanterns were installed for public urban lighting. In 1868 gas lighting began, and electric lighting in 1913. In 1867 a dam was built in the locality of Corongiu under Mount Serpedd√¨ to provide the city with a water supply service; until that time the city had been served by brackish well water. In 1871 the first stretch of railway to connect Cagliari to Sassari and Porto Torres was inaugurated. The project was completed in 1881. In 1893 a suburban steam tram service was started, connecting the city center with the towns that are now part of the metropolitan area, Monserrato, Selargius, Quartucciu, and Quartu Sant'Elena. In 1913 another steam tram line connected downtown with Poetto Beach. In 1915 the first two electric urban tram lines were inaugurated. During the Fascist period the city experienced rapid population and economic growth and a monumental building policy inspired by the ideology of the regime. Fascist architecture and urbanism, such as the tribunal palace and the Carabinieri brigade commander palace, still constitute the main reference points of the modern city. From 1861 to 1936, the population grew to about 88,000 inhabitants, an increase of 237%. World War II German Army parade in Via Roma 1943 bombing effects in Piazza Garibaldi During World War II Cagliari was heavily bombed by the Allies in February 1943. There was a strategic bombing plan to destroy the Axis powers' military capability but also to terrorize their population and sabotage the economic war effort. The fascist war caused the destruction or serious damage of 80% of the city's housing and the death of almost 2,000 civilians, due mostly to cluster bombs. The town was coventrated,from the name of the British city of Coventry, destroyed by the bombing of the Luftwaffe as was said at that time. In order to escape the bombardments and the misery of the destroyed town, almost everyone left Cagliari and moved to the countryside or rural villages, often living with friends and relatives in overcrowded houses. This flight from the town was known as \\"sfollamento\\" (deserting). After the Italian armistice with the Allies in September 1943, the German Army took control of Cagliari and the island, but soon retreated peacefully in order to reinforce its positions in mainland Italy. The US Army then took control of Cagliari. Cagliari was strategically important during the war because of its location in the Mediterranean Sea. Many airports were near Cagliari: (Elmas, Monserrato, Decimomannu, the latter currently a NATO airbase) from which airplanes can fly to Northern Africa or mainland Italy and Sicily. Rebirth Via Roma Regional Parliament palace After the war, the population of Cagliari rebounded. The city was so quickly rebuilt that there was talk of the Cagliari miracle, and many apartment blocks were erected in new residential districts, often created with poor planning as to recreational areas. The wounds of war are still not completely healed. Some medieval churches, such as St. Dominic, St. Catherine and Saint Lucia, were demolished, as well as several buildings in the historic center. In their place there are still ruins or the emptiness of the urban fabric. In the city's most important cemetery there is a memorial on graves where nameless victims were buried. The Constitution of the Italian Republic, born from the ruins of war declared by Mussolini and the Savoy Monarchy, reconstituted the political unity of the island, begun with the Perfect Fusion in 1847, creating the Autonomous Region of Sardinia. Cagliari was declared the capital of the new autonomous institution. The offices of the region were concentrated in the city, which became the goal of a massive urban migration from other parts of the island. The population of all the municipalities of the metropolitan area increased by 205% between 1951 (221,734) and 2011 (453,728). Nowadays Cagliari is the hub of a modern metropolitan area of about half a million inhabitants, with a vibrant and differentiated economy, which makes it the largest and richest community of Sardinia with a standard of living equal to that of the cities of northern Italy and well away from the degradation of those in the south. In addition to being the center of administration of the Autonomous Region and peripheral administrations of the Italian State in Sardinia, it has a major port with a large container terminal, remarkable industrial development in particular with one of the largest oil refineries of Europe, a large university and research centers, high-standard medical facilities, a wide network of large and small commercial assets, a considerable amount of touristic traffic, and one of the most important Italian airports. Cagliari is the metropolis of Sardinia, a role it has continuously maintained for 2500 years. See also * Timeline of Cagliari References Citations Bibliography * .

She was the daughter of former Illinois governor Joseph W. Fifer and was the first female senator in the Illinois General Assembly. She served for two terms from 1924 to 1932. Early life Florence Fifer was the youngest of three children born to Gertrude and Joseph Fifer in Bloomington, Illinois. She lived on Franklin Square until her father was elected as Illinois governor in 1889. That year, the family moved to Springfield, Illinois. Florence first became interested in politics after listening to her father's discussions with fellow politicians, such as Richard J. Oglesby, David Davis and Jesse W. Fell. When she was 15 years old, Florence attended the Hillside Home School in Spring Green, Wisconsin (incorrectly titled the Unitarian Hillside School by her in a later article). After graduating in 1895, she returned to Bloomington. Shortly after coming home, she met Jacob Bohrer, who taught Latin, Greek and German languages at Illinois State University while studying law at Illinois Wesleyan University. They married on May 5, 1898. Their first child, Joseph, was born in 1899 and their second child, Gertrude, was born in 1901. After marrying, Florence became an active member of the community. She was on the committee that founded the Bloomington Country Club and was a member of the Amateur Musical Club. She also formed the \\"Mother's Club,\\" which eventually merged with the national Parent-Teacher Association. In 1910, Florence's daughter contracted tuberculosis. Seeing the need for a local sanitarium, she formed the McLean County Tuberculosis Association with four other community members. Florence began traveling across McLean County, educating citizens on the symptoms of tuberculosis and checking children's health with the help of a nurse. Florence was successful in her efforts, and a sanitarium opened on August 17, 1919. Additionally, in response to concerns about children's health, the county initiated a hot lunch program in rural schools. Florence continued her involvement in the community, serving as chairman on the committee to create a new Girls Industrial Home in 1917, as well as chairman for the Home Service Committee for the Red Cross during World War I. Political life During Florence's sanitarium lobbying, she became acquainted with numerous citizens of McLean County. In 1924, four years after the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment, a few friends suggested she run for the Illinois Senate because she was well known in the community and was the most qualified woman to run. Her candidacy was announced on January 25, 1924. Her platform included progressive welfare work, balancing power between Chicago and downstate, and lessening taxation. Florence's friend, Sara Forsyth, became her campaign manager, and women in the county formed the Florence Fifer Bohrer Club to support her campaign. She succeeded in defeating the current Senator Frank Hanson in the primary election. In the fall elections, Florence's campaign focused on increasing law enforcement, the protection of agricultural interests, and the reduction of taxes. She won the election by a two to one margin. Before leaving home for Springfield, her father advised her, \\"Never forget that the welfare of the state is more important that the welfare of your political party.\\" The day Florence was officially seated in the senate, sixty members of the Florence Fifer Bohrer Club and approximately 600 other women from across the state traveled to Springfield to witness the event. Florence served on numerous committees in the senate, including ones related to charity, civil service, the economy, and public safety. She introduced and sponsored multiple bills, such as the Dance Hall Bill, which limited the operation of dance halls, a bill that opened the way for a state park system in Illinois, and a bill that made \\"Illinois\\" the official state song. Florence also introduced the Midwife Bill, which would have provided training and state licensing for midwives. It was not voted into law. She also sponsored 20 bills related to child welfare, half of which became law. In 1932, Florence ran for senate for a third time. The recent death of her husband and mother hindered her ability to campaign, and support for the Republican Party was waning. Florence was not reelected. She returned to Bloomington, and became chairman of the McLean County Emergency Relief Office. Additionally, the Florence Fifer Bohrer Club was converted into a League of Women Voters chapter, and Florence served as president. She was elected to the National League Board in 1936. In 1934, Florence was awarded the Bloomington Community Service Award and in 1945 the Illinois Welfare Association recognized her for her service in social action and justice.

It is a concept album with the track titles referencing, in descending fashion, the oceanic depth zones. Musically, the concept is explored by sequencing the music such that it is increasingly dark and claustrophobic in emulation of the diminishing light and increasing pressure that comes with oceanic descent. The album was initially conceived as an instrumental release, although vocals were subsequently added; the band has made both versions available. Pelagial was released in Germany on April 26, 2013, in Europe on April 29, and in North America on April 30. The album entered the German Album Chart at #68 and is the band's first charting album. Concept The concept of Pelagial is multi-dimensional. The first, most literal, level involves a journey from the surface to the lowest depth zone of the ocean, with the album's movements getting progressively darker and more claustrophobic to mimic the diminishing light and increasing atmospheric pressure. However, at a second, allegorical level, the ocean layers serve as an extended metaphor for a journey into the inner depths of the psyche. Guitarist and songwriter Robin Staps described this aspect of Pelagial as a movement \\"towards the essence and origins of our desires, wishes, dreams, and all the fucked up attributes inside of our own inner selves that generate and shape them\\" and said that there are \\"a lot of Freud-like references\\" in the lyrics and song titles. Pelagial was written as a single piece of music in order to fit the concept of a journey through the depth zones of the ocean. However, according to Staps, it was separated into 11 tracks to \\"make certain sections accessible\\". The concept was further elaborated musically through the use of samples from old submarine movies, which The Ocean used to imbue the songs with a similar \\"claustrophobic atmosphere\\". Staps, referencing the German film Das Boot as exemplary of the genre, said of the old submarine movies: Staps described the sampling technique used on Pelagial as \\"very subliminal\\" and suggested that the instrumental version of the album will make the samples more apparent due to the absence of vocals and the alternate mix. The lyrics are inspired by and make reference to Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 science fiction film Stalker. Vocals Pelagial was initially conceived as an instrumental album. Robin Staps explained in September 2012, while the album was still under development, that Pelagial would be largely or entirely instrumental. \\"The reasons are manifold, but there simply is no space on this album, both from a musical as well as from a conceptual point of view, for lyrics and vocals. Lo√Øc [Rossetti] is going to continue to be our vocalist, but the time is now right for instrumental metal. We need more of this.\\" Subsequent to the band recording the instrumental album, it was announced that Rossetti had recently recovered from a disorder affecting his voice and would indeed contribute vocals to Pelagial.http://plattentests.de/rezi.php?show=10265 Some editions of the album include a second disc featuring the all-instrumental version of Pelagial with an alternate mix. Guitarist Jona Nido later explained the band's reversal: \\"Lo√Øc is the frontman of this band and we all felt that The Ocean and this album needed him... I'm glad we decided to record vocals in the end, because it really adds a new dimension to the album that was not there before.\\" Staps later said that Rossetti's vocal health was \\"part of the reason we decided to have it instrumental originally\\". He confirmed that part of the logic for releasing both the vocal and instrumental versions of the album was that the band can shift to an instrumental configuration for live performances if Rossetti's health problems return. Video The limited edition version of Pelagial comes with a DVD movie made by Craig Murray, which Staps described as \\"basically a massive video clip.\\" The video was designed to enhance the experience of the Dolby 5.1 surround sound mix included with the limited edition version. The movie, which will also be incorporated into the visuals for the band's live show, features a female protagonist who embodies the psychological aspects of the lyrics for Pelagial. Reception Pelagial has received universal acclaim, with About.com describing it as \\"a stunning collection of ideas and emotions\\" and Axis of Metal predicting that it would be a contender for album of the year in 2013. The Monolith added that the album represented a marked progression from the band's previous releases, Heliocentric and Anthropocentric. However, the album has also garnered some criticism. CraveOnline.com described the album as lacking in soul and incapable of making an emotional connection with the listener. Blabbermouth took a contrary position and described the album as an \\"emotional leviathan\\". Some publications wrote of a disjunction between the vocals and the instruments due to the nature of the recording. Scratch the Surface praised the band's decision to include both the vocal and instrumental versions of the album so as to offer both experiences to the audience.

In 1984, Anton√≠n J. Liehm founded the European culture magazine Lettre International. The French version ceased publication in 1993, but some of its many offspring remain in publication. Notably, the German version of the magazine has come out continuously since its foundation in 1988. Biography Anton√≠n J. Liehm studied political sciences at Charles University in Prague, graduating in 1949.  Kulturn√≠ politika  In 1945, Liehm, along with Emil Franti≈°ek Burian, founded a weekly magazine, titled Kulturn√≠ politika (Cultural politics). The magazine was pro-communist and would eventually be taken over and kept in publication by the Czech Writers' Association. Foreign minister Vladim√≠r Clementis offered Liehm a position in the ministry's press department. Clementis was hanged in 1952, after the Stalinist Sl√°nsk√Ω trial. Subsequently Liehm himself was fired from his position at the ministry and at the magazine. In 1956 Liehm was hired back, then finally let go again in 1960. Liter√°rn√≠ noviny In 1960, Liehm started work at the literary magazine Liter√°rn√≠ noviny. Liehm took over as editor in 1960/1961. The magazine's circulation went up to 130,000 copies per issue. Among those working close to Liehm at the time were Ludv√≠k Vacul√≠k, Milan Kundera, Jan Proch√°zka, Pavel Kohout und Ivan Kl√≠ma. Publication and further development of the magazine ceased, along with the Prague Spring after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Emigration and Lettre International In 1969 Liehm emigrated to Paris with his wife Drahom√≠ra N. Liehm. After temporarily accepting a teaching position at Richmond College-CUNY in the USA, Liehm and his wife returned to Paris in 1982, where he held a post at the Paris Diderot University and later at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales. Liehm taught at the University of Pennsylvania from 1979 until 1983. In 1984 Liehm founded the magazine Lettre International, along with writer Paul Noirot. Liehm described the magazine's concept in these words: \\"If we had a good text, whether German, American, Russian, then we sought out a context for it. Other texts that would surround it, provide commentary, even if they were not written for that purpose at all. [‚Ä¶] Our goals was to produce a play of mirrors around a text.\\" Bibliography *Louis Aragon, Anton√≠n J. Liehm: Cestuj√≠c√≠ z imperi√°lu: rom√°n. Spisy (Louis Aragon).

The provision is found in G.S. 105-164.3(28) and reads as follows: *28) Prepared food. ‚Äì Food that meets at least one of the conditions of this subdivision. Prepared food does not include food the retailer sliced, repackaged, or pasteurized but did not heat, mix, or sell with eating utensils. **a. It is sold in a heated state or it is heated by the retailer. **b. It consists of two or more foods mixed or combined by the retailer for sale as a single item. This subdivision does not include foods containing raw eggs, fish, meat, or poultry that require cooking by the consumer as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration to prevent food borne illnesses. **c. It is sold with eating utensils provided by the retailer, such as plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, and straws. Currently this legislation is only approved for use by fourteen local jurisdictions throughout North Carolina. Legislative approval The prepared food tax proceeds are restricted by county and local jurisdictions. A portion of the revenue that is generated is earmarked for tourism or programs designed to increase visitor services. Enacted jurisdictions Charlotte and Mecklenburg County are proposing a 1% increase to the already existing 1% tax on food and beverage sold within the county.http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/queen_city_agenda/2013/01/food- fight-in-carolina-panthers.html?page=all The request is being made in an effort to fund a renovation project for the Carolina Panthers, the National Football League team located within the city limits. This one percent increase will equate to approximately 23 million dollars in additional revenue for the city. This proposal has not been decided on by the General Assembly. Prospective funds The Meals Tax Predictor projected positive revenues for 71 counties and negative revenues for eight counties.http://www.mpa.unc.edu/sites/www.mpa.unc.edu/files/DAnnaWade- forwebposting.pdf The projected Meals Tax revenue was divided into the amount the county would generate by increasing its property tax by one cent. This produced the one cent Meals Tax equivalent for property tax. Fifty-one of the seventy-one counties' Meals Tax equivalents generated more than one cent of property tax. For 20 counties, the Meals Tax equivalent generated less than one cent on the property tax. Therefore, for a majority of North Carolina counties, implementing a one cent Meals Tax could produce more revenue than a one cent property tax increase. Restrictions governing use The use of the Prepared Food Tax must be specifically earmarked by the jurisdiction for use on tourism or cultural projects. The implementation of this tax would benefit the vast majority of counties and municipalities within North Carolina, but only if they are able to show a need for funds in accordance with the restrictions of the tax. The effects felt The financial data of revenue, collected by the State Treasurer's Office, on each respective county provides for an insight into the expected funds that could be generated by implementing such a tax.https://www.nctreasurer.com/Pages/default.aspx This tax would affect everyone when \\"eating out\\" within each county, but may prove more beneficial to the resident as well as the jurisdiction. The jurisdictions within the state that implement this tax can show a high level of tourism, which will generate a larger number of food sales. The residents within the jurisdiction will also find themselves subject to this tax, but if it were implemented in lieu of a property tax increase it may prove more fiscally prudent for the individual taxpayer. The amount of tax each household pays when eating out, may be far less than an increase in property taxes. The household can also control the amount of tax they pay by not eating out, opposed to a hike in a required property tax.

Physical properties The Gemological Institute of America characterizes the Princie Diamond as fancy intense pink, natural color, VS2 clarity, Type IIa. The Princie diamond is at this time the largest Golconda-type fancy intense pink diamond ever to be graded at the Gemological Institute of America. The Princie also has the property that when exposed to ultraviolet light it displays bright orangey-red fluorescence. According to the Gemological Institute of America this kind of reaction to ultraviolet light is typical of diamonds of Indian origin. Of more than 7 million diamonds that have gone through the Gemological Institute of America's laboratory, no more than 40 exhibited this phenomenon and the Princie is the largest pink diamond that possesses it.Among those diamonds that have gone through the G.I.A.'s lab History The diamond was discovered about 300 years ago in the Golconda mines. Long before it was known as the \\"Princie\\" or by any other name it belonged to the royal family (Nizams) of Hyderabad, its first known owners. The then Nizam of Hyderabad had it auctioned in 1960 at Sotheby's. It was bought by the London branch of the jewelers Van Cleef & Arpels for 46,000 British pounds. It was then sent to their Paris store where it was named \\"Princie\\" by Pierre Arpels in honor of the fourteen-year-old son of Sita Devi, the Maharanee of Baroda, Sayajirao Gaekwad (1945‚Äì1985). The diamond has not gone to auction or been seen in public since 1960. 2013 auction It was auctioned by Christie's in New York on 16 April 2013 for what was a record-breaking price and was expected to sell for more than 45 million dollars. In the event it only fetched 39.3 million dollars which is still a record breaking price. It sets the record for being the most valuable Golconda mine diamond ever sold at auction and the highest price for any jewel sold at Christie's, surpassing the previous house record of 24.4 million dollar set in December 2008 with the sale of the Wittelsbach Diamond. It was purchased by an anonymous collector bidding by phone.

The story involves a Union gold shipment, which is stolen and buried in the desert. Both Union and rebel forces struggle to find it while threatened by the Comanche. A romance complicates the action. Plot At the end of the American Civil War, a group of Southern rebels steal a Union shipment of gold and bury it in a cave near an area known as Phantom Hill, Texas. After they are captured by Union forces, their leader secretly makes a deal with the army to reveal the gold's location in return for his release; a release based on a pardon promised him by the Confederate States of America at the beginning of the Civil War. An army captain and four other men are given the job of accompanying the rebel on the journey to locate the gold. As the men are getting ready to leave, they are compelled to take with them a woman who is essentially being ordered out of town. She and the captain are attracted to each other, though initially the relationship is not warm. Phantom Hill is located on land newly-assigned to the Comanche and the group must deal with hostilities from them. Eventually, after the gold is located, the rebel gets one of the group drunk, kills him and steals his gun. He kills another man, then escapes with the group's weaponry, the wagon filled with the gold, and the woman. The remaining men, without guns, must again face the Comanche. After this confrontation, only the captain and one other remain alive. The set off in pursuit of the rebel.

In it she outlines her theory of neurosis. In Horney's view, the key difference between neurosis and healthy growth is the difference between compulsive actions fueled by anxiety and spontaneous actions fueled by one's full range of emotions. If a person grows up able to maintain his or her spontaneity, that person grows up by a process which Horney calls self-realization. Horney describes self-realization as the development of a person's given potentialities, and compares it with the process of an acorn growing, given fertile soil, into a tree. The principal subject of the book, however, is what happens when a person's spontaneity is crushed in early life. The person will slowly lose touch with that spontaneity or \\"real self\\" and develop, instead, a reactive self which is constructed to respond to dangers of various kinds. If a child's early environment is such that the child grows up seeing the world as basically hostile, compulsive actions will predominate and the child will grow up devoted to allaying anxiety. This development and its consequences for the adult personality are what Horney calls neurosis. Horney devotes thirteen chapters to an analysis of the neurotic development in all its nuances and the various forms it can take as a person grows into adulthood, one chapter to the process of overcoming neurosis in therapy, and one chapter to how her theory compares and contrasts with classical psychoanalytic theory.  Influence  This book was the inspiration for Robert C.

The attacks came just days before the provincial elections which was held on 20 April. Background Violence in Iraq has decreased since its peak in 2006‚Äì07, but attacks remain common. Deaths rose in 2012 for the first time in three years. In the months leading up to the 20 April provincial elections, the first since the withdrawal of US forces in 2011, tensions were high in Iraq as Sunni groups claimed they were being marginalized by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Shiite dominated government. A number of large scale attacks linked to the Sunni umbrella group Islamic State of Iraq were carried out in early 2013 in an attempt to destabilize the country ahead of the elections. At least fourteen election candidates have been murdered, while Anbar and Nineveh provinces have postponed elections because of security concerns. Four other provinces are not scheduled to hold elections on 20 April. Attacks The series of attacks began during the morning early rush hour and encompassed more than 40 incidents in and around 20 cities, the majority of them being car bombings. Both Sunni and Shia areas were targeted in the attacks. Initially no group claimed responsibility for the wave of violence. In the capital Baghdad, two car bombs exploded at a heavily guarded checkpoint at the entrance to Baghdad International Airport, killing 3 and injuring 16 others. A blast in Kamaliyah killed 4 and injured 13, while a bombing at a market and a bus station in Umm al-Maalif killed 4 and injured 15. Twin blasts in Habibiya and Karrada killed 4 and injured 24 others, while a car bomb in Shurta killed 2 and injured 9. A roadside bombing wounded 5 policemen in Baladiyat. In the ethnically divided city of Kirkuk, a series of six car bombs left 9 people dead and 79 others injured. The attacks took place in three different neighborhoods in the center of the city ‚Äì one predominantly Arab, one Kurdish, and one Turkmen. Militants also shot and injured a local doctor. At least three car bombs exploded in Tuz Khurmatu, a city at north of Baghdad, killing six and leaving 67 others injured. In Mosul, unidentified gunmen shot and killed a married couple and another civilian. A soldier was killed in another shootout with suspected insurgents, while 3 police officers and 2 civilians were injured in roadside bombings. An additional bombing inside the city resulted in no casualties. A bombing at a local political office in Tikrit killed 4 and wounded 3 others, while a later blast at a checkpoint injured 13 policemen. A blast in Ad-Dawr also injured 13 people, while 7 others were wounded after a bombing at a politician's home in a village in Saladin Governorate. In the town of Tarmiyah, north of Baghdad, gunmen shot and killed a police officer. Another officer was killed by a sticky bomb in Buhriz. A roadside bombing in Al Khalis killed a young child and injured 8 others. A car bombing in Muqdadiyah injured seven people. Five people were wounded in two separate blasts in Baqubah, including two policemen. A roadside bomb injured a civilian on a rural road outside Khan Bani Saad. A bombing in Tal Abta killed a police officer and injured two others. Unidentified gunmen killed a captain and injured 2 soldiers in Sabeen, as well as a young man in Shirqat. In Fallujah, a suicide car bomber killed 2 policemen and injured 6 others at a checkpoint, while a sticky bomb killed 2 civilians. Unidentified gunmen shot dead another civilian, while a bombing south of the city resulted in no casualties. A blast in Ramadi targeted a local Sunni cleric, killing 2 of his bodyguards and injuring another. At least 19 civilians were injured in two car bombs that struck near Hillah in Iraq's Babil Governorate. In the southern city of Nasiriyah a car bomb was detonated near a market, killing 2 and injuring 14 others. On 16 April police officials in Kirkuk announced they had arrested a group of five individuals who were involved in the bombings in that city. Another eight people suspected of involvement were arrested by a joint army and police force in Diyala Governorate. Elsewhere, the violence continued. In Aziziyah, a city south of Baghdad a car bomb killed at least four people on 16 April, and left 15 others injured. In Mussayib, another southern city, a roadside bomb killed a soldier and injured two other people. Another bomb killed a civilian and wounded two others north of Baghdad. Three injuries were also reported in Tarmiyah.

Pressure cooker bombs have been used in a number of attacks in the 21st century. Among them have been the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, 2010 Stockholm bombings (failed to explode), the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt (failed to explode), the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, and the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. Description Pressure cooker Pressure cooker bombs are relatively easy to construct. Most of the materials required can be easily obtained. The bomb can be triggered using a simple electronic device such as a digital watch, garage door opener, cell phone, pager, kitchen timer, or alarm clock. The power of the explosion depends on the size of the pressure cooker and the amount and type of explosives used. Similar to a pipe bomb, the containment provided by the pressure cooker means that the energy from the explosion is confined until the pressure cooker itself explodes. This in turn creates a relatively large explosion using low explosives and generating potentially lethal fragmentation. History 2000‚Äì09 French police prevented a terrorist attack in Strasbourg, France, on New Year's Eve 2000. Ten Islamic militants were convicted for the plot. From 2002‚Äì04, pressure cooker bombs were widely used in terror and IED attacks in Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. In 2003, a terrorist from Chechnya named Abudullah, carrying a pressure cooker bomb detonated explosives and killed six people before being arrested near Kabul International Airport in Afghanistan. The Taliban claimed responsibility. In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security issued a warning to US agencies about pressure cookers being converted to IEDs. In July 2006, in Mumbai, India, 209 people were killed and 714 injured by pressure cooker bombs in the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. According to Mumbai Police, the bombings were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba and Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). 2010‚Äìpresent Step-by-step instructions for making pressure cooker bombs were published in an article titled \\"Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom\\" in the Al-Qaeda-linked Inspire magazine in the summer of 2010, by \\"The AQ chef\\". The article describes the technique as a simple way to make a highly effective bomb. Analysts believe the work was the brainchild of Anwar al-Awlaki, and edited by him and by Samir Khan. Inspire's goal is to encourage \\"lone wolf\\" Jihadis to attack what they view as the enemies of Jihad, including the United States and its allies. Justice Department diagram showing positioning of pressure cooker in Faisal Shahzad's vehicle in New York‚Äôs Times Square bombing Several Islamic radical terrorist attempts in the 2010s involved pressure cooker bombs. The unsuccessful Times Square car bombing attempt in May 2010, in New York City, included a pressure cooker bomb which failed to detonate. The bomb-maker, Faisal Shahzad, was sentenced to life in prison. In the December 2010 Stockholm bombings, a suicide bomber with extreme views on Islam set up a pressure cooker bomb, which failed to detonate. In July 2011, Naser Jason Abdo, a U.S. Army private at Fort Hood, Texas, who took pressure cooker bomb-making tips from the Al-Qaeda magazine article, was arrested for planning to blow up a restaurant frequented by U.S. soldiers. Two pressure cookers and bomb-making materials were found in his hotel room. He was sentenced to life in prison. In Pakistan, in March 2010, six employees of World Vision International were killed by a remotely detonated pressure cooker bomb. In October 2012, French police found a makeshift pressure cooker with bomb-making materials near Paris as part of an investigation into an attack on a kosher grocery store. Two pressure cooker bombs were used in the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013. The pressure cookers were filled with nails, ball bearings, and black powder. Initially, it was believed the devices were triggered by kitchen-type egg timers, however, subsequent evidence indicated a remote device was used to trigger the bombs. One of the bombers, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, told investigators that he learned the technique from an article in Inspire magazine. On Canada Day 2013, pressure cooker bombs failed to explode at the Parliament Building in Victoria, British Columbia. On May 19, 2016, passengers on a bus in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, alerted the driver to a suspicious package. The driver removed the package from the bus. Shortly later it exploded with no fatalities but did injure one woman slightly. Authorities believed it was a three liter pressure cooker packed with nails and nitrate explosive.Gregor Gowans, \\"No Fatalities Following Explosion Involving Bus 145\\", Wroclaw Uncut, 19 May 2016. On September 17, 2016, an explosion occurred in Lower Manhattan, New York, wounding 29 civilians. The origin of the explosion was found to be a pressure cooker bomb. At least one other bomb was found unexploded. A suspect for that explosion and others in New Jersey, Ahmad Khan Rahami, was captured two days later. Both the 2010 Stockholm bombings and the foiled 2016 Sweden terrorism plot involved pressure-cooker bombs.

He was brother of conductor and singer Oleksa Chupryna- Chekhivsky. Biography Early years Chekhivsky was born on July 19, 1876 to the family of a clergyman in a village of Horokhuvatka, in the Kievsky Uyezd of Kiev Governorate (today in Kaharlyk Raion). In 1900 he graduated from the Kiev Theological Academy and the University of Odessa, from 1905 he was a Doctor of Theology. From 1897 he was a member of the student club of Drahomanov's Socialist-Democrats. From 1901 to 1905 Cherkhivsky worked as Deputy Inspector of the seminaries of Kiev and Kamyanets-Podilsky. Because of his activity and interest in Ukrainian nationalism at the seminaries, Chekhivsky was dismissed and transferred to the Cherkassy Province. From 1905 to 1906 he was a teacher of Russian language as well as of the History of Literature and the Theory of Philology at the Cherkassy Theology College. Between 1902-1904 Chekhivsky was a member of the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party, after which he switched to the Ukrainian Social Democratic Labor Party (USDLP) until 1919. In 1906, he was elected to the Imperial Duma, however the Russian government exiled him, as a Ukrainian to Vologda in Russia. However, through the efforts of his electors to the Imperial Duma, he was returned from exile after one year. From 1908 to 1917 Chekhivsky lived in Odessa where he taught in a gymnasium as well as commercial and technical colleges. During that time he was under open police surveillance. Nonetheless, Chekhivsky participated in the activities of a local Ukrainian Hromada and Prosvita association. Since 1915 he was a member of a masonic lodge \\"Star of the East\\" that existed in Odessa and was part of the Great East of Peoples of Russia. Revolutionary years After the February Revolution Chekhivsky became editor of the \\"Ukrayinske Slovo\\" newspaper that was published in Odessa. From April 1917 he headed the Odessa committee of the USDLP and the Ukrainian council of Odessa. From May 1917 Cherkhivsky was a district inspector of the Odessa School Council and headed the Odessa branch of All-Ukrainian Teachers Union. From June 1917 he was a deputy () in the Odessa city duma from the Ukrainian parties, and headed the Kherson Governorate Council of united public organization. In October‚ÄìNovember 1917 Chekhivsky was a member of the Revolutionary committee (revkom). In November 1917 he became a political commissar of Odessa and an education commissar of the Kherson Governorate. At that time Chekhivsky was also elected to the Russian Constituent Assembly (from the Ukrainian Social-Democrats of Odessa). In the beginning of 1918 he became a member of Central Committee of the USDLP and from April 1918 ‚Äî appointed as director of confessions as a minister in government of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Under the administration of Pavlo Skoropadsky, Chekhivsky continued to work in the Ministry of Confessions (director of General Affairs department), yet continuing to be a member of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Labor Party. During that time he joined the Ukrainian National Union which was in opposition to the Hetman of Ukraine. From Directorate to its opposition Chekhivsky headed the Ukrainian revkom during the anti-Hetman uprising. From December 26, 1918 to February 11, 1919 Chekhivsky was President of the Council of People's Ministers and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ukrainian People's Republic. During that time was proclaimed the Unification Act of two Ukraines on January 22, 1919. On January 1, 1919 the government approved laws about the state language of Ukraine (Ukrainian) and about the autocephaly of Ukrainian Orthodox Church that were adopted by the Directorate of Ukraine. On January 5, 1919 the government approved the Land law that was adopted by the Directorate on January 8. Chekhivsky followed leftist political views, advocated compromise with Bolsheviks, opposed the treaty with Entente. On those issues his position was similar to the point of view of Volodymyr Vynnychenko. Chekhivsky had a little influence on the army of Ukraine. After failing to reach an agreement with Bolsheviks, successful offensive of the Red Army and willingness of the Ukrainian leadership to negotiate with French led to resignation of Chekhivsky in February 1919. After that was in opposition to the government of Symon Petliura. In spring of 1919 participated in organization of the Labor Congress of Ukraine in Kamyanets-Podilsky. Cooperation with the Soviets and arrest After the occupation by the Red Army Chekhivsky stayed in Ukraine and in 1920 joined the Ukrainian Communist Party. In October 1921 he participated in the 1st All-Ukrainian Church Assembly that confirmed autocephaly of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) and was an adviser to Metropolitan Vasyl Lypkivsky, organized pastoral courses in Kiev. Chekhivsky was one of the main ideologists of the Ukrainian Church autocephaly and supporter of Christian socialism. In October 1927 he became a chairman of the 2nd All-Ukrainian Assembly of UAOC. During that time Chekhivsky also worked in the All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences at its history-philology department, was a professor of medical and polytechnic institutes in Kiev, lectured at social-economical courses. On July 29, 1929 Chekhivsky was arrested in connection with the Union for the Freedom of Ukraine process and on April 19, 1930 sentenced to death through shooting, changed to 10 years of imprisonment. He was confined to the Khabarovsk and Yaroslavl political prisons, from 1933 - in Solovki prison camp. In 1936 Chekhivsky was additionally sentenced to three years of imprisonment.

She was married into the princely family of Eristavi, former Ducal House of Ksani.  Biography  Princess Anastasia was born at the village of Martkopi in Kakheti in 1763 as the twelfth child into the family of Heraclius and Darejan. On 12 November 1797, at the age of 34, she married Prince Revaz (Roman) Eristavi (c. 1757‚Äì1813), a son of Giorgi, Duke of Ksani, who had been dispossessed by Heraclius II of his hereditary duchy in the Ksani valley. Revaz's sister Ana was married to Anastasia's younger brother Parnaoz. The union was effected to the chagrin of King Heraclius. As she did not receive a dowry from her father, at the time of the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, Anastasia's possessions were limited to a garden near Tiflis granted by her half-brother, the late king George XII. In 1802, she was suspected by the Russians of being involved in facilitating the communication between her mother Queen Dowager Darejan in Tiflis and her fugitive anti-Russian brothers, Iulon and Parnaoz, in Imereti. After the establishment of the Russian rule, Anastasia's husband entered the imperial civil service as a Collegiate Counsellor. Already a widow, Anastasia moved to St. Petersburg in 1825, bringing her younger son, Giorgi, for further education in the imperial capital. She died there of pneumonia in 1838, at the age of 75. She was buried at the Church of the Holy Spirit, Alexander Nevsky Lavra.  Children  Princess Anastasia had five children with Revaz Eristavi. # Prince Iese Eristavi (died 1811) # Prince Shalva Eristavi (1798 ‚Äì 12 August 1849), a Titular Counsellor in the Russian service. He was murdered by a peasant, Biba Dodashvili. He was married to Princess Ekaterine Orbeliani, with issue. # Prince Bidzina Eristavi (1800‚Äì1876), podporuchik of the Russian army. He took part in the 1832 conspiracy of the Georgian nobles against the Russian rule and spent eight months in prison. He was married to Princess Tamar Melikishvili, with issue. # Prince Giorgi Eristavi (12 February 1802 ‚Äì 5 November 1891), Lieutenant-general of the Russian army.

Apotex Inc., [1992] 3 SCR 120, is a Supreme Court of Canada judgment on trademark law and more specifically the issue of passing off. Ciba-Geigy brought an action against Apotex and Novopharm, alleging that their versions of the prescription drug metoprolol were causing confusion to the public due to their similar appearance to Ciba-Geigy's version of the drug Lopresor. On appeal to the SCC, the issue was whether a plaintiff is required to establish that the public affected by the risk of confusion includes not only health care professionals but also the patients who consume the drugs in a passing off action involving prescription drugs of a similar appearance. The Supreme Court held affirmatively on this question.  Background  Ciba-Geigy is a pharmaceutical laboratory which has manufactured and sold metoprolol tablets in Canada under the trade name \\"Lopresor\\" since 1977. Metoprolol is a prescription drug generally prescribed for hypertension. After Apotex obtained licenses to manufacture and sell metoprolol in Canada, its version of the tablets have had the same get-up (shape, size and colour) as those of Ciba- Geigy since 1986. Novopharm, another respondent joined in the action also manufactured tablets with the same get-up. The three drugs have been designated interchangeable pharmaceutical products by Ontario law, which means that a pharmacist may give a patient any one of them as long as the prescription does not specify no substitution.Ciba-Geigy Canada Ltd. v. Apotex Inc., [1992] 3 SCR 120 at paras 2-6. In June 1986 the Ciba-Geigy brought passing-off actions against Apotex and Novopharm, alleging that its metoprolol tablets have a unique get-up by reason of their size, shape and colour and that this get-up has become associated with its product.Ciba-Geigy at paras 7-9. In order to establish that Apotex and Novopharm were engaged in passing off by confusing the public with their products, Ciba-Geigy needed to prove that the customers of these drugs were likely to be misled by the similarity of the products. At the trial level, Ciba-Geigy failed to establish that the customers, namely physicians and pharmacists that prescribe or dispense metoprolol, were confused in choosing the brand of metoprolol to give to patients due to the similar appearance of the tablets. For this reason, the Supreme Court of Ontario refused to issue an interlocutory injunction because Ciba-Geigy failed to show that there was a \\"serious issue\\" to be tried.Ciba- Geigy at para 13. At the Court of Appeal, Ciba-Geigy argued that the customers affected by the passing-off should include ultimate consumer of the prescribed drug as they are likely to be confused by the similar appearance of the products in question. The Court of Appeal rejected its argument and dismissed the appeal.Ciba-Geigy at paras 17-19.  Reasons of the court  The unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court was delivered by Justice Gonthier. The Court allowed the appeal and held that a plaintiff in an action for the alleged passing-off of a prescription drug must establish that the conduct complained of is likely to result in the confusion of physicians, pharmacists or patients/customers in choosing whether to prescribe, dispense or request either the plaintiff's or the defendant's product. Therefore, patients are considered to be part of the relevant public in a passing-off action as they are the ultimate consumes of the drugs.Christopher Wadlow, The Law of Passing- off: Unfair Competition by Misrepresentation (UK: Sweet & Maxwell, 2011) at 770.  General principles of passing off  The Court concluded three necessary components of a passing-off action from previous case law: the existence of goodwill, deception of the public due to a misrepresentation and actual or potential damage to the plaintiff. In order for a manufacturer to succeed in a passing off action, he or she had to show that its product had acquired a secondary meaning with its customers and that the competing product was likely to create a risk of confusion in the public mind.Ciba-Geigy at paras 33-36; Theresa M Corneau, ed, Trade-Mark Practice in Canada (Canada: Borden Ladner Gervais LLP, 2011) at 102. The confusion can arise from both wilful as well as negligent or careless misrepresentation by the manufacturer.Ysolde Gendreau, An Emerging Intellectual Property Paradigm: Perspectives from Canada (UK: Edward Elgar Publishing, 2009) at 59; Emir Crowne & Sepideh NassabiÔºå \\"Parsing off the Elements of Passing Off in Canada\\" (2012) 39 Adv Q 452 at 455.  Purposes of the passing off action  The Court stated that the purpose of a passing-off action is to protect all persons affected by the product, which include the persons who manufacture or market the products, on the one hand (\\"the manufacturers\\"), and on the other to those for whom the products are intended, the persons who buy, use or consume them (\\"the customers\\").Ciba-Geigy at paras 38-39. = Protection of manufacturers = In determining the purpose of a passing off action, the Court cited Consumers Distributing Co. v. Seiko Time Canada Ltd.:Consumers Distributing Co v Seiko Time Canada Ltd, [1984] 1 SCR 583. \\"The courts have wavered between two conceptions of a passing-off action -- as a remedy for the invasion of a quasi-proprietary right in a trade name or trade mark, and as a remedy, analogous to the action on the case for deceit, for invasion of the personal right not to be injured by fraudulent competition.\\" The Court decided that the true basis of a passing off action is the latter, or that it injures a property right in the plaintiff, which is the owner's right to the goodwill of his or her business.Ciba-Geigy at para 43. It further concluded that the purpose of passing off is also to prevent unfair competition and loss of profit for the manufacturer injured by the misrepresentation.Ciba-Geigy at paras 46-47. = Protection of customers = The SCC has long recognized trademark laws as being enacted primarily in the interest and for the protection of the public.David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2011) at 427. The Court in this case also emphasizes that the purpose of a passing off action is to protect the public from misrepresentation by manufacturers. Because the product's appearance or its packaging, in terms of shape, size or colour, may be characteristic of a particular manufacturer, consumer may associate the appearance with either a brand or trademark in his or her mind, or rely on the appearance to indicate the use of the product without knowing the name of the product or manufacturer.Ciba-Geigy at paras 54-55. The question that needed to be addressed by the Court was that who are the consumers that must be protected from being confused by manufacturers when their products are of a similar appearance. Based on previous cases outside the field of pharmaceutical products, the Court observed that the \\"clientele\\" in whose minds confusion must be avoided includes all customers, whether direct (for example retailers) or indirect (consumers).Ciba-Geigy at paras 62-65.  Affected customers in the pharmaceutical field  An important precedent considered in this appeal is the case of Ayerst, McKenna & Harrison, Inc. v. Apotex Inc.(1983),Ayerst, McKenna & Harrison, Inc v Apotex Inc (1983), 41 OR (2d) 366 (ONCA). which addressed similar issues associated with drugs with similar appearance. In the Court of Appeal decision, Cory J.A. commented that for the purposes of a passing-off action the customers of pharmaceutical laboratories consist exclusively of health care professionals and not the patients who use the product.Ciba-Geigy at paras 70-72. This decision was subsequently followed by a number of cases.Ciba-Geigy at para 107. The Court declined to follow the opinion in Ayerst, McKenna & Harrison. One of the reasons is that the field of prescription drugs is just like any other market, where the ultimate consumer should be taken into account in a tort of passing off, and there is no reason for the Court to adopt a different rule when the manufacturer is a pharmaceutical laboratory.Ciba-Geigy at para 98. In addressing Ciba-Geigy's argument, the Court also observed that despite the regulatory restriction on public advertising of prescription drugs, patients can still gain knowledge about the products through pharmaceutical advertising directed at health care professionals, and therefore risk being affected by confusion.Ciba-Geigy at paras 94-97. Another important consideration by the Court is that the Prescription Drug Cost Regulation Act which later came into force gave patients increased control over the brand of drug he or she wishes to obtain where the product is interchangeable. The Court found that patients do have the opportunity to exercise their choice over the product brand in the prescription process, therefore patients should be included in the customers covered by the passing-off action as they are also exposed to the risk of confusion.Ciba-Geigy at paras 83-92.

Biography Fay initially worked as a clerk for his father, an attorney. His father died in 1825, and he continued long enough in law to be admitted to the bar in 1828, but he quickly left the legal profession for periodical journalism, where he made a name for himself for some years. To this period belongs his book Dreams and Reveries of a Quiet Man (2 vols., 1832), which contained papers he had written for the New York Mirror, where he was an editor beginning in 1828. He married Laura Gardenier in 1833, and went traveling in Europe for three years, while sending back articles to the Mirror. He served with ability in the United States diplomatic service, first as secretary of the legation at London briefly (1837), then at Berlin (1837‚Äì53), and next (1853‚Äì61) as Minister at Berne, Switzerland. He retired from his diplomatic career in 1861. He then moved to Berlin. His first wife died while he was at Berne, and he later married a German woman. Works Other works include: *Views in New-York and its environs, from accurate, characteristic & picturesque drawings, taken on the spot, expressly for this work (New York: Peabody & Co., 1831).

In addition to the estimation tools in LIMDEP, NLOGIT provides programs for estimation, model simulation and analysis of multinomial choice data, such as brand choice, transportation mode and for survey and market data in which consumers choose among a set of competing alternatives. In addition to the economic sciences, NLOGIT has applications in biostatistics, noneconomic social sciences, physical sciences, and health outcomes research. History Econometric Software, Inc. was founded in the early 1980s by William H. Greene. NLOGIT was released in 1996 with the development of the FIML nested logit estimator, originally an extension of the multinomial logit model in LIMDEP. The program derives its name from the Nested LOGIT model. With the additions of the multinomial probit model and the mixed logit model among several others, NLOGIT became a self standing superset of LIMDEP. Models NLOGIT is a full information maximum likelihood estimator for a variety of multinomial choice models. NLOGIT includes the discrete estimators in LIMDEP plus model extensions for multinomial logit (many specifications), random parameters mixed logit, random regret logit, WTP space specifications in mixed logit, scaled multinomial logit, nested logit, multinomial probit, heteroscedastic extreme value, error components, heteroscedastic logit and latent class models. Data Analysis NLOGIT is typically used to analyze individual, cross section data on consumer choices and decisions from multiple alternatives. Analysis may also include market shares or frequency data, data on rankings of alternatives, and panel data from repeated observation of choice situations. The inference tools for hypothesis testing include the Wald, likelihood ratio and Lagrange multiplier tests and tools for discrete choice analysis, including built-in procedures for testing the IIA assumption of the multinomial logit model. The models estimated by NLOGIT can be used in ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô analyses using the model simulation package. The base case model produces fitted probabilities data that aggregate to a prediction of the sample shares for the alternatives in the choice set. The simulator is then used, with the estimation data set or any other compatible data set, to recompute these shares under specified scenarios, such as a change in the price of a particular alternative or a change in household incomes.

What kind of persons they wrong and what these persons are like. * Chapter 11: \\"Topics about Pleasure\\" categorizes pleasure as natural, not compulsive, and can be the cause of crime: gaining revenge, winning, or restoring honor. * Chapter 12: \\"Topics about Wrongdoers and Those Wronged\\" includes many features of both the wrongdoers and the wronged that relate to criminalities: **Wrongdoers: believe they will not be detected or punished, are likely to go unsuspected if their appearance is inconsistent with the charges (a weak man charged with assault), have either no enemy or many enemies. **Those who are wronged: have something the wrongdoer lacks, do not live cautiously, have never been wronged, or have been often wronged with no retaliation. * Chapter 13: \\"Topics about Justice and Injustice\\" discusses the law in two ways: specific (that which has been defined for each person) and common (that which is based on nature or common principle). * Chapter 14: \\"The Koinon of Degree of Magnitude\\" proposes: \\"A wrong is greater insofar as it is caused by greater injustice. Thus the least wrong can sometimes be the greatest.\\"Aristotle, On Rhetoric, 1.3.14. Aristotle asserts that varying degrees of wrong exist based on the accessibility of retribution from the wronged and punishment for the wrongdoer. * Chapter 15: \\"Atechnic Pisteis in Judicial Rhetoric: Laws, Witnesses, Contracts, Tortures, Oaths\\" summarizes the objects listed in its title, including evidence that supports or refutes a case. These summaries and guidelines are very practical in law both in Aristotle's and in modern times. Aristotle also focuses on fairness and introduces the possibility that the defendant could be legally guilty yet morally justified.Kennedy 1991, 87‚Äì118. Early connection between law and rhetoric According to George A. Kennedy, rhetoric emerged as a response to legal freedoms introduced in Greece around 467BC. \\"Citizens found themselves involved in litigation... and were forced to take up their own cases before the courts. A few clever Sicilians developed simple techniques for effective presentation and argumentation in the law courts and taught them to others.\\"James Jasinski, \\"Forensic Discourse,\\" Sourcebook on Rhetoric (2001). Thus, trained capacity in speech-making and the theory about such speech- making exists because of legal exigencies. The Stasis Doctrine, proposed by Hermagoras, is an approach to systematically analyze legal cases, which many scholars include in their treatises of rhetoric, most famously in Cicero's \\"De Inventione.\\"Jakes Jasinski, \\"Stasis,\\" Sourcebook on Rhetoric (2001). Encyclopedia author James Jasinski describes this doctrine as taxonomy to classify relevant questions in a debate and the existence or nonexistence of a fact in law.Jasinski 2001, 530. The Stasis Doctrine is incorporated in rhetoric handbooks today. Traditional connection between law and rhetoric Since forensic rhetoric's original purpose was to win courtroom cases, legal aids have been trained in it since legal freedoms emerged. Because in early law courts, citizens were expected to represent themselves and training in forensic rhetoric was very beneficial.George A. Kennedy, Classical Rhetoric & its Christian and Secular Tradition from Ancient to Modern Times, (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1999), 20‚Äì21. In ancient Athens, litigants in a private law suit and defendants in a criminal prosecution were expected to handle their own case before the court ‚Äì a practice that Aristotle approved of. The hearings would consist of questions addressed to the litigant/defendant and were asked by a member of the Court, or the litigants could ask one another; these circumstances did not call for legal or oratorical talent ‚Äì therefore oratory or legalism was not expected, encouraged, or appreciated. After the time of Solon, the Court of Areopagus was replaced and the litigant/defendant would deliver a prepared speech before the courts to try and sway the jury; they expected dramatic and brilliant oratorical displays. Now, listeners appreciated oratorical and even legalistic niceties, such as appeals to passion, piety, and prejudice. It was at this point in Athens history where the forensic speech-writer made his first appearance. The speech-writer would prepare an address which the litigant/defendant memorized and delivered before the court. Forensic speech- writing and oratory soon became an essential part of general rhetoric.Anton- Hermann Chroust, Legal Profession in Ancient Athens, 29 Notre Dame L. Rev. 339 (1954). After the nineteenth century, forensic rhetoric \\"became the exclusive province of lawyers,‚Äù as it essentially remains today.Kennedy 1999, 28. These people were experts in the court system and dominated forensic rhetoric, since it is tied to past events‚Äîthus the relationship between law and rhetoric was solidified.Laurent Pernot, Rhetoric in Antiquity, (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 2005), 190. Contemporary connection between law and rhetoric The critical legal studies movement occurred because as John L. Lucaites, a prominent author on the subject, concluded both legal studies and rhetorical scholars desire to demystify complex law discourse.J. L. Lucaites, \\"Between Rhetoric and \\"The Law\\": Power, Legitimacy, and Social Change,\\"Quarterly Journal, 76 (1990): 379‚Äì96. His task was to \\"explore how 'the law'‚Äîconceptualized as a series of institutional procedures and relationships‚Äîfunctions within a larger 'rhetorical culture'.\\" Author James Boyd White cultivated the law and literature movement, promoting the relationship between law and rhetoric at the constitutive level of discourse.Jasinski 2001, 262. The name law and literature relates to both the study of law in literature (such as legal fiction) and law as literature (the community built from a discourse community).Steven Mailloux, Rhetorical Power, (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1989). This movement asserts that the process of interpretation, both in law and literature, is rhetorical: \\"interpretation is a process of constructing arguments and the meaning of a text emerges through rhetorical interaction.\\" References Category:Rhetoric Category:Philosophy of law ","title":"Forensic rhetoric"},{"id":"39131959","text":"\\"I Remember You\\" is the twenty-fifth and penultimate episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series Adventure Time. The episode was written and storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on October 15, 2012. The episode later re-aired on March 25, 2013, together with the fifth season episode \\"Simon & Marcy,\\" and as such was advertised as a half-hour special. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Marceline the Vampire Queen (voiced by Olivia Olson) collaborates with the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny) to write a song, and Marceline tries to get the Ice King to remember who he really is. This episode reveals that Marceline and the Ice King previously knew each other from the aftermath of the Mushroom War, a cataclysmic event that occurred a thousand years before the beginning of the series. Formerly titled \\"Help,\\" \\"I Remember You\\" helped expand upon and explore the Ice King's previous life. The episode features four songs‚Äî\\"The Fry Song,\\" \\"Oh Bubblegum,\\" \\"Nuts,\\" and \\"Remember You\\"‚Äîall of which were written by Sugar, although Sanchez co-wrote the lyrics on \\"Oh Bubblegum.\\" Sugar used an omnichord for the demo of the eponymous song, and her playing ended up as part of the episode. \\"I Remember You\\" was watched by 2.535 million people and received universal acclaim, with many critics praising the story's depth and its exploration of mental disorders, memory, and loss. Plot Background In the context of the series, Marceline the Vampire Queen is a thousand-year-old vampire. The Ice King is a recurring antagonist of the series, and frequently steals princesses throughout Ooo; although he is often at odds with Finn and Jake, he is generally not a serious threat. He was formerly a human archaeologist named Simon Petrikov who discovered a magic crown that gives him magical ice powers but eroded his memory and made him go insane. In addition, throughout the series, various character and events hint at the mysterious Mushroom War, a cataclysmic war that destroyed modern human society. Events The Ice King decides that he wants to enlist Marceline's help in writing a song to woo princesses, taking pages randomly torn from an old scrapbook with him for later inspiration. He flies to her cave, and after a minor scuffle that involves Finn and Jake, Marceline finally relents and helps him write a song. At first, the Ice King simply sings a song he wrote about Princess Bubblegum, before breaking down, crying about his loneliness and damaging Marceline's living room with his ice magic. Marceline tells him to \\"stop acting crazy\\", and he pushes her, before timidly retreating to the top of her refrigerator. Marceline begins to lament, via the song \\"Nuts,\\" and notes that, despite his instability, she is glad to see him. The Ice King is surprised to find out that she \\"likes\\" him and asks for a hug. However, when he misinterprets her feelings and tries to kiss her, Marceline angrily confronts him and asks if he remembers his past by calling him by his actual name: Simon. The Ice King is oblivious to his former self, and Marceline begins looking through the Ice King's scrapbook pages to show him evidence of his former life. Among the pages is a picture of a young Marceline, with a message to her from a thousand years ago scrawled on the back. The message, written by Simon before his mind was completely consumed by the magic of the crown, asks Marceline to forgive him for whatever he does under the crown's influence. The Ice King fails to understand the context, and believes that he has written not a note of apology but lyrics, and attempts to add music to his \\"song\\". Overcome by emotion, Marceline cries and begins singing along while the Ice King plays drums, oblivious as to what is actually going on. As they sing, a flabbergasted Finn and Jake watch the pair from outside Marceline's house, not knowing what exactly is going on. While the eponymous song \\"Remember You\\" is being sung, the episode flashes back almost a thousand years before the events of the episode. A young Marceline is seen crying in the wreckage of a city, presumably after the cataclysmic Mushroom War. Simon Petrikov sees her from a distance and runs over. In an attempt to comfort her, he gives her Hambo, a teddy bear, that he finds in the ruins of a toy store. Marceline takes the stuffed animal, stops crying, and looks up in happiness. Production Storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar used an omnichord for the eponymous song \\"Remember You\\". \\"I Remember You\\" was storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. The episode was directed by Larry Leichliter, with Adam Muto serving as creative director and Nick Jennings serving as art director. The original working title for the episode was \\"Help\\". Former storyboard artist and creative director for the series Adam Muto joked that the change was made due to the famous Beatles song of the same name. The idea to create an episode based on a shared history between Marceline and the Ice King was Ward's idea. Sugar had also been pushing for a Marceline and Ice King musical episode. Sugar was responsible for designing Marceline's look in the episode. According to her, the shirt that Marceline wears was \\"loosely based off a stretched out old D.A.R.E. shirt.\\" The episode features three new songs: \\"Oh Bubblegum\\", \\"Nuts\\", and the titular \\"Remember You\\". Sugar composed the music for all four, and wrote the lyrics (Sanchez co-wrote the lyrics for \\"Oh Bubblegum\\"). Sugar recorded demos for the songs and Rob Sugar, Rebecca's father, released the three new demos on his official YouTube account. For the demo for \\"I Remember You\\", Sugar recorded vocals over a separate track of her playing an omnichord; Sugar's ominchord playing was eventually worked directly into the episode. While Sugar was pitching the song, she played her songs but her omnichord started to lose power. Sugar and the crew realized that the sound of the omnichord losing power fit with the mood of the episode. According to Rob, the \\"off-key notes were accidents of running out of power‚Äîit took a lot of tries to make it happen on cue.\\" For the eponymous song, Sugar wrote on her personal Tumblr that it \\"was so amazing to work with Olivia Olson and Tom Kenny on the songs for this episode, they had so much chemistry in the booth together!\\" She wrote that she constructed the episode to \\"do them justice.\\" Olson noted that, despite the sad themes featured in the installment, recording the dialogue with Kenny and music for the episode was a fun experience. While the two were recording, Olson had to sing Kenny his melodies; Kenny would then parrot the lines back in the voice of the Ice King. In addition to the three new songs, the episode also features a modified version of \\"The Fry Song\\", which had originally appeared in the second season episode \\"It Came from the Nightosphere\\". During the recording of the aforementioned episode, Tom Kenny recorded his own version of the \\"Fry Song\\" for fun, which was later included in the third season episode \\"Holly Jolly Secrets\\". This version later inspired Ice King's alternate \\"Gunter\\" version in \\"I Remember You\\". Reception \\"I Remember You\\" aired on October 15, 2012. It was viewed by 2.535 million people, and received a 0.5 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 0.5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds at the time of the broadcast. The episode later re-aired on March 25, 2013, together with the fifth season episode \\"Simon & Marcy,\\" and was advertised by Cartoon Network as a \\"half hour special.\\" This special was watched by 2.6 million viewers. The episode received glowing critical acclaim. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 called the episode \\"one of the most intense things I've seen in ages.\\" She specifically cited the final flashback as noteworthy, noting that \\"The final scene, where Marceline and Ice King have this weird duet, made me lose my shit and keeps popping into my head. It's rare that any television show gets its hooks into your brain like that, but especially a kid's cartoon.\\" She concluded that the main reason that the ending was so powerful was that it showed the viewers the \\"immediate aftermath of the Mushroom War\\" and allowed the viewers to see \\"the way Marceline's personal loss mirrors the wider loss of the end of the entire world\\" following the war. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club wrote that \\"never has an Adventure Time episode triggered waterworks like 'I Remember You'.\\" He called it \\"one of the most touching stories this series has ever told,\\" and praised the way it took Marceline and the Ice King‚Äîwhom he called two of the show's most tragic characters‚Äîand put \\"them together in a way that hits like a sledgehammer.\\" He felt that the episode also served as a way to tell \\"a heartbreaking story about how mental illness can tear people apart,\\" noting that the Ice King's condition is similar to how people with bipolar disorder behave. Eric Kohn of IndieWire, in an article explaining why \\"Adventure Time is the best sci-fi show on TV right now\\" following the airing of \\"Simon & Marcy,\\" wrote that \\"I Remember You\\" was \\"the finest entry in the series' history.\\" He further complimented the titular song, describing it as \\"heartbreaking\\" and \\"show-stopping.\\" Steven Aoun of PopMatters applauded the way the episode \\"focuses on two popular supporting characters, and foregrounds the relation between memory and identity.\\" Furthermore, the site noted that \\"the sound that takes you by surprise may be your own crying.\\" Novelist Lev Grossman, in an interview with NPR, praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition, noting that his origin is \\"psychologically plausible.\\" Grossman praised the way the series was able to tackle the issues of mental illness, saying: \\"It's very affecting. My dad has been going through having Alzheimer's, and he's forgotten so much about who he used to be. And I look at him and think this cartoon is about my father dying.\\" Media release The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 Jake the Dad DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' fourth and fifth seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. In addition, the 2015 limited edition 12\\" vinyl record release Marceline the Vampire Queen Rock the Nightosphere included both \\"Nuts\\" and \\"I Remember You\\" alongside other songs sung by Marceline.

It has been nicknamed \\"Spur's Defeat\\", which is thought to refer to the spurs used by the soldiers to drive their horses away from the battle as quickly as possible. The campaign is sometimes referred to as the Second Battle of Tippecanoe.Dyer ‚Äì link below Second Tippecanoe campaign Following several defeats and massacres in 1812, notably the Fort Dearborn Massacre and the Pigeon Roost Massacre, a joint punitive campaign was sent to Illinois Territory under the commands of Major General Samuel Hopkins and Colonel William Russell. Russell, coming from the Siege of Fort Harrison, led a force of Illinois militia and Indiana Rangers, and was successful in destroying a hostile Kickapoo village on Peoria Lake. Russell had to retreat to Cahokia, however, when he could not locate the forces under Hopkins. Hopkins could not get his Kentucky militia to engage, and had been driven back to Vincennes when the Kickapoo started a prairie grass fire.Allison, 192 Hopkins was humiliated by his loss, and discharged the Kentucky militia under his command. He then raised a new army, consisting of three regiments of Kentucky Infantry, one company of the 7th Infantry under Major Zachary Taylor, a troop of Indiana Rangers, and a company of scouts.Allison, 193 Hopkins left Vincennes on 11 November 1812 and marched north, following the same route William Henry Harrison had taken in 1811. When the army reached the site of the Battle of Tippecanoe, they found that some of the United States' dead had been exhumed and scalped. The bodies were reburied before the army proceeded to Prophetstown, which it reached on 19 November. Prophetstown had been destroyed in the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe, but was now partially rebuilt, with an even larger Kickapoo village nearby. All residents and provisions had been evacuated as the army approached. The army burned the villages to the ground. A Winnebago village was found nearby, on Wildcat Creek, and Hopkins decided to attack it. Colonel Miller led 300 men and destroyed the evacuated village.Allison, 194 On November 21, as a scouting party explored the creek, they were fired upon, and the entire force retreated to rejoin the main army, leaving behind the body of a soldier named Dunn. The next day, 22 November, Colonels Miller and Wilcox accompanied Captain Beckes and sixty Indiana Rangers to recover Dunn's body. After riding about six miles up Wildcat Creek, they found a dead comrade's head stuck on a pole and a Native standing beside the head taunting them. Thirteen Indiana Rangers were outraged by this and chased the rider, but he managed to stay ahead of them, and led them into a narrow canyon. Here, Kickapoo, Winnebago, and Shawnee warriors ambushed the Rangers. Within two minutes, twelve men and several horses were dead or dying. Many of the officers were killed, and the Rangers fled. One man who escaped did so by spurring his horse to gallop faster, hence the naming of the battle \\"Spur's Defeat\\". One man, Benoit Besayon, had been a long-time trader with the Indian villages in the area, and was captured alive in the canyon. He was judged to be a traitor, and sentenced to be burned at the stake. As the fire was lit, however, a friend took pity on him and shot him. The American losses on November 21‚Äì22 were seventeen killed and three wounded. Scouts learned that a large force of Native Americans were gathering to fight Hopkins' army, and they prepared to do battle as soon as possible. Bitter cold set in, however, and a snowstorm threatened the expedition. When the Indian camp was reached on 24 November, it was deserted. Hopkins turned back, stopping at Fort Harrison to recover from the weather before proceeding to Vincennes. By the time they reached Fort Knox, two hundred men were suffering from sickness or frostbite.Allison, 195 Hopkins became so depressed from his successive losses that he resigned. Hopkins was brought before a Court of Inquiry for his actions in the Illinois Territory and Prophetstown. He was cleared of any wrongdoing by the military tribunal and later ran for the Senate. Modern investigations Although it has been claimed there was no significant importance to this battle, General William Henry Harrison's military operational plan reflects the overall importance of the expedition. Hopkin's mission was twofold. First, he wanted to drive the hostile Kickapoos to Canada in response to the Fort Dearborn Massacre. Second, he wanted to burn Prophetstown again to drive the Aboriginal Confederacy also towards Canada and out of the Northwest Territories. Hopkin's men encountered 200 mounted Indian warriors which they had never experienced before. This and the weather were the two factors that drove Hopkin's expedition back to Fort Harrison. The actual site of this esoteric American defeat is unknown. The Carroll County Historical Association has erected a historic marker at the intersection of W 550 S Rd. and S 800 W Rd. in the town of Pyrmont (40.4673532, -86.6800204) noting that the site is \\"in a nearby ravine\\". Purdue University and Indiana State archaeologists and historians suggest that there is little scholarly interest in the site and the event because of its lack of importance. Local amateur reenactment groups have taken an interest in commemorating the event. However, the found site has been verified by archeologists donating their time to have found the skirmish site and possible burial location of the 18 men.

Exhibitions PCVA This exhibition, the first ever show about the history of PCVA, and was largely a display of archival documents and ephemera. Founded in 1971 by artists Jay Backstrand, Mel Katz, and Michele Russo, PCVA brought seminal contemporary art to 117 NW Fifth Avenue between 1972-1987. Mary Beebe became the director in 1973 and during her prolific tenure exhibited Michael Asher, Allan Kaprow, John Baldessari, Vito Acconci, William Wegman, Joan Jonas, Dan Flavin, Robert Smithson, Terry Riley, Eleanor Antin, Phil Niblock, Nam Jun Paik, Robert Irwin, Meredith Monk, and Bruce Nauman, along with numerous Northwest artists. Many of the works, epistles, and internal documents are lent by the Portland Art Museum's Crumpacker Family Library, which has housed the PCVA archive since 1988. The opening reception included a screening of Richard Serra's Railroad Turnbridge (1976), which was filmed at the St. Johns Railroad Bridge in Portland. Saul Steinberg This exhibition collected some two hundred of Saul Steinberg's one thousand published contributions to the New Yorker and other publications of note. During his lifetime, Steinberg's work was shown at the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Smithsonian Institution. The exhibition program included a talk by Stuart Bailey of Dexter Sinister; a screening of Modern Times by Charlie Chaplin; a lecture by the exhibition coordinators Robert Snowden and Scott Ponik; a screening of The Right Way by Fischli and Weiss. The exhibition travelled in September 2012 to ARTSPACE, a non-profit institution in Auckland, New Zealand. Marianne Wex From 1972 to 1977, Wex compiled an archive consisting of thousands of banal and clandestine photographs of women and men in the streets of Hamburg. She re-photographed magazines and newspapers, advertisements, art-historical reproductions, her television, whatever was in reach. She arranged the results and collaged them into large paste-up panels and a book, titled, \\"Let's Take Back Our Space: 'Female' and 'Male' Body Language as a Result of Patriarchal Structures (1979).\\" At the center of both the panels and the book is a wide disputation about how we create and present ourselves, and the degree to which gender-specific conditioning and hierarchies are reflected through everyday pose, gesture, and pre-verbal communication. Marianne Wex was born in 1937 in Hamburg, and now lives in H√∂hr-Grenzhausen, Germany. She studied at the University of Fine Arts in Hamburg and taught there from 1963 to 1980. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she showed her work in national and international solo and group exhibitions (including at NGBK Berlin, Frankfurter Kunstverein, Bonner Kunstverein, and ICA London). Wex's photo panels were shown in 2009 at Focal Point Gallery in London and in 2012 at the Badischer Kunstverein in Karlsruhe, Germany. Yale Union presents the work of Marianne Wex for the first time in the United States. The program included a screening of Helke Sander's film The All-Around Reduced Personality (1978); a reading by Chris Kraus; a screening of Chantal Akerman's film Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975); and a talk by Avigail Moss. Angie Keefer On January 18, February 9, February 22, March 8, and March 22, 2013, Angie Keefer gave five different talks to a live audience. Angie Keefer (b. 1977) graduated from Yale University in 1999. Her work has taken place at the 2012 S√£o Paulo Biennial; MoMA, NY; Artist Space, NY; and the Kunsthal Charlottenborg, among others. In 2011, she co-founded, with David Reinfurt and Stuart Bailey, The Serving Library. The Serving Library is a long-term project that looks at how the role of the library has changed over time, from fixed archive through circulating collection to a disseminating pimple on the internet. Of course, that description is not quite right, but expression is always a compromise. Anderson & Fisher This exhibition consisted of a survey of films from 1964 to 2013. On March 30 and 31, 2013, Andersen and Fisher visited Portland to discuss their working relationship. On March 30, 2013, Fisher introduced a new state of Screening Room, (1968/2013), a film that can only be shown in the auditorium for which it was made. Thom Andersen (born 1943, Chicago) is a filmmaker, film critic, and teacher. He currently teaches film theory and history at the California Institute of the Arts. He made his first film in 1964 and his latest in 2012. His films were most recently shown in the 2012 Whitney Biennial. Morgan Fisher (born in 1942, Washington, DC) teaches film at the European Graduate School. He made his first film in 1968, and his most recent in 2003. Fisher has had solo exhibitions at Portikus, Frankfurt; Raven Row, London; and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Lucy Skaer In July 2013, Lucy Skaer opened a show titled, \\"Monday 8.4.13.. Monday 22.4.13.\\" Materials used in the exhibition included archival newsprint and twenty-two tons of lithographic limestone extracted from a site in Iowa for use in the show. Lucy Skaer was born in Cambridge in 1975. She attended the Glasgow School of Art, receiving her BA in 1997. She has had solo exhibitions at the Chisenhale Gallery, London; Kunsthalle Basel; Kunsthalle Wien; and Location One, New York. She represented Scotland in the 52nd Venice Biennale, and she was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 2009. Skaer lives and works in Glasgow, Scotland. Susan Howe For this exhibition a poem was commissioned, printed, and exhibited in its printed form. The work, titled, \\"TTT,\\" was also performed by the artist, and accompanied by a lecture. Susan Howe was born in 1937. This is her first solo exhibition. Apart from her poetry, she is the author of two landmark books of literary criticism, My Emily Dickinson and The Birth-mark: Unsettling the Wilderness in American Literary History, and three records with David Grubbs. Howe received the 2011 Bollingen Prize for American Poetry and a Guggenheim Fellowship. She has been a Stanford Institute for Humanities Distinguished Fellow, as well as an Anna- Maria Kellen Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin. She taught for many years at the State University of New York-Buffalo. She lives in Guilford, Connecticut. Tom Tit Tot was co-curated by Robert Snowden and Andrea Andersson. Andersson has taught at Columbia, Barnard, and New York University. A curator, she writes primarily on 20th and early 21st century experimental writing with a particular focus on the relationship between visual, sound, and language arts. Most recently she arranged a survey exhibition entitled Postscript: Writing After Conceptual Art. George Kuchar George Kuchar was an American Video_art and underground film Film director, known for his \\"low-fi\\" aesthetic. Yale Union has been showing Kuchar's films and videos since 2008. \\"Although Kuchar was unknown to Susan Sontag at the time she wrote Notes on \\"Camp\\" (1964), she could have been referring to his no-budget pictures with her general description of camp as being 'serious about the frivolous, frivolous about the serious. The essence of camp is its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration. Camp sees everything in quotation marks. The ultimate camp statement is it's good because it's awful.'\\" In an interview from 2009 George Kuchar said, \\"Makin' pictures, see, sometimes you see a very beautiful person. And the first thing that comes to my mind is, I want to make a movie of that person. 'Cause I like puttin' gauzes‚Äîah, cheap, black cloth on the lens with a rubber band‚Äîand creating these, what look like 1940s movies, or movies of a beautiful Hollywood style, and blowing these people up bigger than life and making them into gods and goddesses. And I think in the movies that's a wonderful way of pushing them on the public, and infusing the public with great objects of desire, and dreams, and things of great beauty‚Ä¶ living human beings of beauty.\\" Terry Atkinson This exhibition consisted of multiple material, formal, and textual elements. Sometimes these elements appeared autonomously, assuming the familiar form of a didactic, painting, drawing, or even minimal sculpture, and in other instances these elements were combined on one surface, or appended to each other. Terry Atkinson was born in 1939. He lives in Leamington Spa, England with his wife, artist Sue Atkinson, with whom he has frequently collaborated. The exhibition was curated by Richard Birkett. Birkett is curator at Artists Space, NY. It is Atkinson's first institutional solo show in the United States.

(16 May 1947 in Budapest, Hungary) is an Australian social psychologist, currently Scientia Professor at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. He was born in Hungary and emigrated to Australia at the age of 22. He is married with two children, and lives in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. Biography He obtained a First Class Honours degree from Macquarie University, and then received scholarships for study in West Germany, and at the University of Oxford, where he obtained his doctorate. Prof. Forgas has been a consistently active and productive researcher, investigating the influence of cognitive and affective processes on interpersonal behaviours. He was among the first to apply multidimensional scaling to the study of cognitive representations of social interaction episodes in memory. Subsequently, he pioneered the systematic exploration of affective influences on social perceptions and judgments, mapping the boundary conditions for affect priming phenomena. He developed the first integrative theory of affective influences, the Affect infusion model (AIM). His experiments have made an important contribution to our understanding of affective influences on many important real-life judgments and behaviours, including survey responses, stereotyping and prejudice, social influence processes, organisational behaviours, bargaining and negotiation, verbal communication and consumer decisions. His work received support from the Australian Research Council (ARC), including an ARC Professorial Fellowship, the ARC's Special Investigator Award, as well as international funding from the German Research Foundation, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, and the National Institutes of Mental Health, USA. Joseph Forgas has published some 26 books, and over 200 articles and book chapters, and his work receives a high rate of citations and references. He received the prestigious Doctor of Science (DSC) degree from the University of Oxford, and was awarded the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award by the Australian Psychological Society. He was elected for an inaugural Scientia Professorship by UNSW, and to Fellowships by the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia, as well as the Association for Psychological Science, the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He also received the Research Prize from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, and a Rockefeller Fellowship for work in the Bellagio Centre. In recognition of his scientific and social contributions, in 2012 he was awarded the Order of Australia (AM). Joseph Paul Forgas has initiated, and continues to organise and run an annual international social psychology symposium in Sydney, the Sydney Symposium of Social Psychology (SSSP), now in its 15th year. These meetings are held every year on a different topic, and bring together leading international researchers in a major field of social psychologyThe Sydney Symposium of Social Psychology The proceedings of each meeting are published annually by Psychology Press, New York, as the Sydney Symposium of Social Psychology Series. Forgas is also co-editor of an international book series, 'Frontiers of Social Psychology' (Psychology Press, New York). He has been Associate Editor of Cognition and Emotion, and the Australian Journal of Psychology, and has been invited to the Editorial Boards of numerous leading journals. Prof. Forgas was Australia's Keynote Speaker at the International Congress of Psychology (Stockholm, 2000), and at the Conference of Italian Social Psychologists (Bari, 2003). His work is featured in many key reference books, textbooks and handbooks. Prof. Forgas is fluent in several languages (English, Hungarian, German, French), and he also maintains highly productive collaborative research links with leading overseas laboratories (Stanford, Heidelberg, British Columbia, Mannheim, etc.).

French for the Future envisions a Canada in which all young people value our French heritage, appreciate francophone cultures and endeavour to excel in the French language.https://www.french-future.org/about-us/our-mission/  History  French for the Future was founded by John Ralston Saul and Lisa Balfour Bowen as a national program for students who are completing their last years of high school in French immersion, or in French-as-a-first-language, mainly outside of Quebec. Originally, French for the Future was a conference ‚Äì a two-day event that brought together students from the Greater Toronto Area. In 2000, the conference expanded and took place in Toronto, Halifax, Vancouver, and Calgary. Each event was connected with one another by satellite-powered radio diffusion technology. In 2001, French for the Future opened its national headquarters in Toronto. The number of cities that organized conferences kept increasing that in 2003, French for the Future introduced 2 new programs: The Horizon Project, which brought students to Montreal to participate in excursions and cultural events; and the Jeunes Franco-Nord project, which united students living in the North to Whitehorse for a French for the Future like conference. In 2004, the Horizon Project transformed to the National Ambassador Youth Forum (FNJA), which took place in Calgary. The last edition of the Jeunes Franco-Nord project occurred in 2005. That same year, the National Essay Contest was launched, originally to select FNJA participants. The French for the Future conferences were renamed Local Forums in 2006, and the amount of participating cities continued to grow. In September 2011, the Franconnexion Sessions were introduced. Later in 2018, French for the Future established its own youth committee: Bilingual Young Leaders. Shortly thereafter in February 2019, faced with growing demands to organize Local Forums in smaller communities, X-Forum was created.  Programs   National Ambassador Youth Forum (NAYF)  Dating back to 2004, this program brings together 30 students from across Canada for an intensive week of learning and appreciating Canada's diverse and ever-changing Francophone culture. The NAYF program focuses on building skills such as leadership, communication and team spirit, with the ultimate goal of creating ambassadors for Canada's bilingualism. Over a week filled with interactive workshops and activities, the ambassadors will learn about the advantages of official- language bilingualism, its major issues and challenges, and to celebrate the Francophone culture. With each participant being selected for their passion and commitment towards bilingualism, the NAYF is a very special experience for these students - the future faces of bilingualism in Canada, and leaders of tomorrow.https://www.french-future.org/programs/nayf/  National Essay Contest  Since 2005, students from across Canada write an essay in French, that adheres to a different theme every year. Contest winners and finalists are awarded exceptional scholarships in order to pursue post-secondary education completely or partially in French.https://www.french- future.org/programs/essay-contest/ In partnership with: * University of Ottawa https://www.uottawa.ca/en * Universit√© Sainte Anne https://www.usainteanne.ca/en/ * Universit√© de Montr√©al https://www.umontreal.ca/en/ * Universit√© de Moncton https://www.umoncton.ca/english/ * Universit√© de Saint-Boniface https://ustboniface.ca/en * Glendon College ‚Äì University of York https://www.glendon.yorku.ca/ * University of Alberta ‚Äì Campus Saint-Jean https://www.ualberta.ca/campus-saint-jean/ * University of Lethbridge https://www.uleth.ca/ * La Cit√© Universitaire francophone ‚Äì University of Regina https://lacite.uregina.ca/en * Coll√®ge Bor√©al http://www.collegeboreal.ca/home/ * The University of British Columbia https://www.ubc.ca/ * Coll√®ge de l‚Äô√éle https://www.collegedelile.ca/en/ In 2018-2019, the National Essay Contest had 12 partnerships with post-secondary institutions and offered a total of $267,000 in scholarships.  Local Forums  Hosted in over 15 cities across Canada, French for the Future's Local Forums unite FSL (French Second Language) and FFL (French First Language) high school students for the opportunity to discover and experience the cultural and professional value of continuing a bilingual education. By participating in a Local Forum, students attend creative and informative workshops, engage in discussions, and take part in exciting cultural events and activities. While also meeting bilingual professionals and sharing ideas and perspectives on French learning, these students become part of the dynamic bilingual community in their region.https://www.french-future.org/programs/local-forums/  x-Forums  x-Forums are local events that bring together students from Grade 7 to 12 enrolled in French as a second language, and French as a first language programs. Their main objective is the promotion of bilingualism and/or linguistic duality. They are independently organized by volunteers, and come from local initiatives in the communities. The x-Forums are unique in their programs and formats, but share the following intentions: * Deliver an inspiring and motivational message about Canadian bilingualism * Give youth an opportunity to play an active role * Create a positive environment in which every student feels at ease speaking French https://www.french- future.org/programs/x-forums/  Franconnexion Sessions  Franconnexion Sessions help students connect the French learnt in the classroom with the real-life benefits of being bilingual. A Franconnexion Session is an event that is organized for students enrolled in any French program (Core, Extended, Immersion, French as a First Language). This one-hour, half-day, or full-day event takes places within a school or school board, and gives students the opportunity to participate in workshops and cultural activities oriented towards the benefits of speaking French, in a fun atmosphere.https://www.french-future.org/programs/franconnexion-sessions/  Bilingual Young Leaders  The Bilingual Young Leaders are a Youth committee founded by French for the Future. It is made up of 7 young committed bilingual Canadians between 16 and 22, who want to develop projects to promote bilingualism. The Committee serves as a springboard for implementing local initiatives that will help promote Canada's official bilingualism via French learning, led by and for youth. The committee represents an expansion of French for the Future's actions, raising awareness among more young people, while allowing a group of qualified young persons to receive training in governance and project management. The Youth Committee also acts as an advisory committee for French for the Future, while aiming to maintain a continual dialogue with young people, in order to keep offering them relevant programs. https://www.french-future.org/programs/bilingual-young- leaders/bilingual-young-leaders-rules/ References Category:Educational organizations based in Canada Category:1997 establishments in Ontario Category:Organizations established in 1997 Category:Non-profit organizations based in Toronto ","title":"French for the Future"},{"id":"39132181","text":"Jinyu may refer to: * Jinyu, the Chinese name for Jin Chinese, a subdivision of spoken Chinese * Jinyu (given name), a Chinese given name * Jinyu Hutong, Beijing, China * Jinyu Station, Chongqing, China ","title":"Jinyu"},{"id":"39132201","title":"1827 Maine's 1st congressional district special election"},{"id":"39132203","text":"Friends Family Forever is the second studio album by Boston hardcore punk band Death Before Dishonor.

Some definitions include rolling about in dust, however, in ethology this is usually referred to as dust bathing. Wallowing is often combined with other behaviours to fulfill its purpose; for example, elephants will often blow dirt over themselves after wallowing to create a thicker \\"coating\\", or pigs will allow the mud to dry before rubbing themselves on a tree or rock to remove ectoparasites stuck in the mud.

To thermoregulate, they rely on wallowing in water or mud to cool the body. Adult pigs under natural or free-range conditions can often be seen to wallow when air temperature exceeds 20 ¬∞C. Mud is the preferred substrate; after wallowing, the wet mud provides a cooling, and probably protecting, layer on the body. When pigs enter a wallow, they normally dig and root in the mud before entering with the fore-body first. They then wriggle the body back and forth, and rub their faces in the mud so all of the body surface is covered. Before they leave the wallow, they often shake their heads and body, often finishing with rubbing against a tree or a stone next to the wallow. When indoors and hot, domestic pigs often attempt to wallow on wet floor surfaces and in the dunging areas. Although temperature regulation seems to be the main motivation for wallowing in pigs, they will still wallow in colder weather. While many have suggested that pigs wallow in mud because of a lack of sweat glands, pigs and other wallowing animals may have not evolved functional sweat glands because wallowing was a part of their behavioural repertoire.Bracke, M. (2011). Review of wallowing in pigs: Description of the behaviour and its motivational basis. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 132: 1-13 Pigs are genetically related to animals such as hippopotamus and whales. It has been argued that wallowing behaviour and the desire to be in shallow, murky water could have been a step to the evolution of whales and other marine mammals from land-dwelling mammals. Sumatran rhinoceros Sumatran rhinoceros wallowing The Sumatran rhino (Dicerorhinus Sumatrensis) spends a large part of its day wallowing. When mud holes are unavailable, the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns. One 20-month study of wallowing behaviour found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time. After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow, the rhino will abandon it. Typically, the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before foraging for food. Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day, the study of wild animals found 80‚Äì300 minutes per day spent in wallows. Captive individuals deprived of adequate wallowing have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins, suppurations, eye problems, inflamed nails, hair loss and have eventually died. Deer A deer wallow Many deer perform wallowing, creating wallow sites in wet depressions in the ground, eventually forming quite large sites (2‚Äì3 m across and up to 1 m deep). However, it has been claimed that only some species of deer wallow; red deer (Cervus elaphus) particularly like to wallow but fallow deer (Dama dama), for example, do not wallow. Even within the red deer species, there is variation between sub-species and breeds in wallowing behaviour. For example, although wapiti do wallow, they and crossbreds are less inclined to wallow than European red deer.

He worked as a member of the Botany Department in the British Forestry Commission until 1951, when he accepted a position as a senior microbiologist in the Department of Plant Pathology at the then Waite Agricultural Research Institute, University of Adelaide where he worked until his retirement in 1986. In 1996 he was honoured by the British Mycological Society, becoming a Centenary Fellow. Warcup published over 70 papers in international peer-reviewed journals and was best known for his work with orchid mycorrhizal fungi, along with Aspergillus and Penicillium species. He was the patron of the Australasian Mycological Society, and two monotypic genera of fungi: Warcupia (family Pyronemataceae) and Warcupiella (family Trichocomaceae) are named in his honour.

He has lived and worked in Bratislava, New York City and Warsaw.  Biography  Raised in Bratislava, Slovakia, Simon began playing the guitar at the age of ten. He started to gain recognition after winning the \\"New Faces of Slovak Jazz\\" young talent jazz competition as a leader of the group Jazzva in 1996. He later moved to New York City in 1998. After receiving a travel/study grant he attended Brooklyn College Conservatory of Music where he received his master's degree. He was trained in composition by Tania Le√≥n, and performance and interactive media arts by John J.A. Jannone and Miroslaw Rogala. His guitar mentors included Matus Jakabcic, Stanislav Pocaji, Fernando Correa, and Daniela Kukumbergova. From 2003 to 2006, Simon taught electronic music composition for film and animation at Pratt Institute in New York. His avant- garde musical concepts were shown in Europe and USA, including the International Society for Improvised Music, International festival and conference on Improvised Music, and published by the University Press of America. Simon has combined in his music the classical and electric guitar sound with modern jazz, rock, acoustic and classical music, free improvisation and other world elements. He has used avant-garde concepts in some of his experimental works, electronic music and multimedia interactive art projects. His body of work has been compared to the work of acoustic guitar virtuoso Don Ross and the experimentation of multi-instrumentalist George Koller. This alliance of music aesthetics is found both in his early compositions (1995‚Äì1998)‚Äîjazz fusion works in which jazz fundaments are treated with synthesizer sounds and electric instruments creating juxtapositions of intense jazz-rock sonic materials with harmonically rich, sometimes almost esoteric material ‚Äîand in later pieces (2000‚Äì2006), in which the integration of opposites, inherent performance complexities and game-like attitude creates the opportunity for free interaction, fusion of singled sounds or even whole ensembles. These compositions are examples of \\"conversational music\\", a term he uses to describe a musical language constructed from processes governing a verbal conversation, that are handled in a musical way. Simon's most recent compositions draw inspiration from Central European folkloric traditions placed in context with jazz, classical music and contemporary influences. Simon's guitar duet with Spanish/Honduran guitarist Astor Escoto resulted in an album Escoto & Simon ‚ÄúCollage‚Äù described as \\"one of the best contemporary world guitar albums of the decade\\". Simon's composition ‚ÄúVision of Seven Keystones‚Äù received a semi-finalist award in the instrumental category of the 2011 International Songwriting Competition ISC after receiving over 16,000 entries. Simon has performed with a world mix of musicians from Western and Eastern Europe, North & South America, Asia, Africa, New Zealand such as David Watson (John Zorn), Paul Steven Ray (Vernon Reid), Salim Washington (Kenny Garret, Anthony Braxton), Chris Bacas (Buddy Rich), Jorge Amorim (Baden Powell, Al Foster), Arturo Martinez (Jos√© Greco), Alfonso Cid (Pilar Rioja), Carlos Hayre, Micha≈Ç Urbaniak, Wojciech Karolak among others. He was member of the New York Mandolin Orchestra and BC Electro-acoustic Music Ensemble. He has collaborated with award-winning film and digital media artists like Miroslaw Rogala, John J.A. Jannone, Ronaldo Kiel, Anat Inbar, and SangHee Ann. He is a founding member of groups Escoto & Simon, Jazzva, Areito, BTY Orchestra, Astro Project, and Slavicada. He has participaded in improvised music events along with masters of free improvisation including Oliver Lake, Art Lande, Mazen Kerbaj, Stephen Nachmanovitch, Pauline Oliveros, Michael Zerang, Anto Pett, Mark Dresser, Jane Ira Bloom, AACM and others.

Riding career Riding style Mellor was an intelligent jockey, rather than a physical one. He once bemoaned the effect this had on public perception of him: \\"If you win with strength people see it, and if you win with style people see it, but if you win with guile people don't see it.\\" He rode at a weight of 8 st 10 lb, not much more than a modern flat jockey. Victory against Arkle Mellor was one of the few jockeys to experience beating Arkle, often regarded as the greatest steeplechaser of all time. His victory against Arkle came in the 1966 Hennessy Gold Cup on 25-1 outsider Stalbridge Colonist. Because of the handicapping system, Arkle was regularly forced to compete conceding huge amounts of weight to other horses, and his defeat is often attributed to that. Mellor himself, however, maintains that Stalbridge Colonist beat him with a \\"turn of foot\\"  1,000 Winners  On 10 December 1971, Mellor rode his 999th winner at Cheltenham. Despite another six rides there the next day, he couldn't add to it. Mellor spent another week trying to pass the landmark, racking up seven more losers in the process. His wife travelled with him every day so as not to miss the celebrations. Finally, at Nottingham on 18 December 1971, he piloted grey gelding Ouzo to victory in the otherwise unremarkable Christmas Spirit Novices' Chase, thus becoming the first jump jockey to ride 1,000 winners. Dismounting from Ouzo, Mellor proclaimed it \\"a great relief\\" and was presented with an inscribed silver salver by his wife on behalf of the racecourse.  Falls and injuries  It is believed that Mellor had 750 falls during his riding career. One especially bad fall coming down the hill at Cheltenham caused his riding cap to slip off and spin away causing his wife, watching in the stands, to scream, \\"Oh my God, his head has come off\\". His worst fall, however, was in the 1963 Schweppes Gold Trophy when his lower face was smashed so badly it was almost completely detached. At the time, he was 20 wins clear of Josh Gifford in pursuit of a fourth successive jockey's title. The injury therefore probably cost him the championship. Training and retirement When Mellor retired as a jockey, he was awarded an MBE in recognition of his achievements. He was also offered an appearance on This Is Your Life, which he turned down. Mellor was originally based at Linkslade Stables in Lambourn. On selling the property, to Sheikh Mohamed Al Sabah of Kuwait, a deal he regards as the best deal he ever did, he was able to buy a yard twenty times the size near Swindon, which was named Pollardstown after his 1979 Triumph Hurdle winner. Mellor was a successful trainer, though not as successful as his time in the saddle. He won a Stewards Cup, two Whitbread Gold Cups and four races at the Cheltenham Festival, including a 1-2 in the 1983 Triumph Hurdle with Saxon Farm and Tenth Of October. His horses Royal Mail and Lean Ar Aghaidh were both placed in the Grand National. He was amongst those who pioneered the import of New Zealand bred horses (such as Royal Mail) and was known as \\"an excellent judge of a racehorse\\". Mellor himself, however, regards his training career as a disappointment, claiming he was too \\"laid-back\\" to succeed. With horse numbers dwindling, he sold Pollardstown in 2001 and retired to Ashbury, near Lambourn. He had trained over 700 winners. Personal life Mellor had a wife Elaine, and two daughters, Dana and Linz, all of whom have ridden winners under Rules. Stan Mellor died on 1 August 2020, aged 83.

The club won the FA Women's Premier League Northern Division in 2014‚Äì15 and the following promotion play-off and is the first club to earn promotion to the FA WSL 2. The teams was founded in 2003 and started at the lowest level of the league pyramid back then. History Sheffield FC Ladies was formed in 2003 when previous team Norton Ladies affiliated with the oldest football club in the world, Sheffield FC. In 2009‚Äì10, Sheffield lived up to their pre-season billing as title contenders and ultimately won the Division One East of the Yorkshire & Humberside League, the bottom level of the women's pyramid of football at the time until the formation of the County Leagues, thanks to a 3‚Äì2 victory in a title-deciding night match against runners up Barnsley at home in front of 150 supporters. The experience of losing a similar contest the season before proved invaluable as the team showed great experience to get the result they needed to lift their second League trophy. The team also reached the semi-finals of the Sheffield & Hallamshire County Cup for the second time, losing in extra time to Rotherham United. And so onto the Northern Combination WFL for the 2010‚Äì11 season which proved to be Sheffield's finest yet as they recorded 18 wins and just two defeats on their way to winning the league title at the first attempt, finishing 11 points clear of runners up Sheffield Wednesday. A third league title in four years meant Sheffield FC Ladies were promoted to the FA Women's Premier League for 2011‚Äì12, a milestone that few could have predicted given the team's humble beginnings. Sheffield LFC in August 2015 Sheffield's debut season at FA WPL level could hardly have gone much better as Sheffield finished the year as runners up, five points behind champions Manchester City. The team picked up silverware for the third season running, this time courtesy of a first win in the Sheffield & Hallamshire County Cup. The team also enjoyed their best run in the FA Women's Cup, reaching the Fourth Round Proper. The first team went one better in 2012‚Äì13 as they lifted the FA WPL Northern Division title for the first time, crowning an incredible rise through the ranks of the women's game. Sheffield were front runners from the start of the season, losing just one league match in total, and finishing nine points clear of Nottingham Forest. They also repeated their success in the County Cup, beating Rotherham United in the final. In 2014‚Äì15, the team won the FA WPL Northern Division for a third year in a row. Because the FA WSL introduced promotion, a play-off between both division champions was held. Sheffield beat Portsmouth 1‚Äì0 and became the first team to earn promotion to the WSL 2. After the 2017‚Äì18 season the club had to withdraw from the second level league for financial reasons.http://sheffield.fawsl.com/news/club_statement.html#bHyQfGqyeh8xIZPV.97 Stadium Sheffield Ladies are based at the Home of Football in Dronfield, Derbyshire.

He was tried at the Majdanek Trials and executed on 3 December 1944 along with five other war criminals near the gas chambers and the Majdanek crematorium. War crimes Thernes was married with six children in Trier before the Nazi German invasion of Poland. A member of the SS, Thernes served as the last administrative chief of KL Lublin / Majdanek. He was also in charge of food and slave labour administration, starvation rationing, and the maintenance of camp structures including the storage depot for property and valuables stolen from the Holocaust victims at the killing centers in Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka.. Thernes was given the task of destroying the evidence of crimes against humanity and genocide, but ran out of time due to his ineptitude and lethargy. Instead of blowing up the chimneys and torching his city of death, the SS actually brought an additional 500 prisoners from Lublin for the last timely kill, while the T-34 tanks were already at the gates. Thernes was caught by the Soviets and tried at the Majdanek Trials together with his assistant SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Wilhelm Gerstenmeier. He denied knowing anything, but the proceedings were swamped with testimonial proofs offered by eyewitnesses. He was executed on 3 December 1944 along with five other war criminals, close to the gas chambers and the Majdanek crematorium. Harvest Festival During the mere 34 months of camp operation, more than 79,000 people were murdered at the main camp alone (59,000 of them Polish Jews). Some 18,000 Jews were killed at Majdanek on 3 November 1943 during the largest single-day, single-camp massacre of the Holocaust, named Harvest Festival (totalling 43,000 with subcamps).

Distributors and makers in each industry submit entries to be judged by a panel of experts. History The competitive event got its start shortly after the repeal of Prohibition in the late 1930s and is one of the longest running of its kind. Originally known as the Los Angeles International Wine & Spirits Competition, the event now includes entries in the categories of wine, spirits, beer and extra virgin olive oil. The competition was created as part of the L.A. County Fair. Local guests could submit their wines and receive medals for their entries. The competition began accepting entries from other parts of the nation and allowed international submissions in 2002. The competition now runs separately from the L.A. County Fair, although award-winning submissions are featured for the duration of the Fair. Competitions Wine, spirits, commercial beer and extra virgin olive oil are the four individual categories in the international competitions. The wine competition receives the most submissions. Categories include champagne, bordeaux, dessert wines, organic wines and others that are typical to similar events. Wine submissions are judged by a panel of 75 wine experts using a blind-tasting method. The wine competition is also the foundation for the wine education program at the L.A. County Fair. The spirits competition was introduced in correlation with the wine competition in 2007. During the inaugural event, entries were limited to Blue Agave Tequilas. The competition was opened to all spirits and mixers in 2010. The judging panel consists of pub and bar owners, distillers and journalists with experience in the field. The extra virgin olive oil category was added in 2002. The competition is open to international entries with oils coming from Italy, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and France. Currently the competition consists of two parts. The Northern Hemisphere Competition invites entries from Croatia, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Palestine, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey and the United States. The Southern Hemisphere Competition includes entries from Argentina, Australia, Chile, New Zealand, Peru, South Africa and Uruguay. The competition was originally created to improve the breed of California extra virgin olive oils There are three categories in the competition: delicate, medium and robust. A number of awards are given at the end of the competition including 6 Best of Show awards. One domestic and one international Best of Show award is given per category. The beer component was introduced in 2000 and falls under the same blind-tasting method as the other competitions. The competition is the least popular of the event but also hosts international and domestic entries annually. Awards Awards are handed out in the form of gold, silver and bronze medals. In order to receive a gold medal, an entry needs a minimum of 90 points. Entries are judged based on the character and style of the wine using elements such as taste, texture and quality of ingredients. In addition to medals, a Best of Show and Best of Division are given per category in each competition. An award for best packaging design is also part of the competition.

The Nova Scotia Museum has listed the site as a Special Place under the Special Places Protection Act. The site acquired its special status when it was discovered as the only and oldest archaeological site in Nova Scotia. The Debert site is significant to North American archaeology because it is the most North-easterly Palaeo-Indian site discovered to date. It also provides evidence for the earliest human settlements in eastern North America, which have been dated to 10,500‚Äì11,000 years ago. Additionally, this archaeological site remains one of the few Palaeo-Indian settlements to be identified within the region of North America that was once glaciated.  History  During the Second World War, a major air base and staging area for men and convoy material being shipped from Halifax to Britain was established in the Debert area. In 1943, construction began to expand parking facilities for military divisions stationed at the site. The parking lot expansion and mortar range activity near the end of the war subsequently decapitated the deposit and left only a small portion of the ancient site to be investigated. Excavations at the site covered approximately seven acres, however further test excavations would reveal that the original occupation covered at least twenty acres. The site was first discovered on August 29, 1948, by E.S. Eaton and his wife who noticed an abundance of blueberries growing in the area. Wind erosion had exposed a small number of artifacts on the bulldozed surface of the parking lot. Eaton, who worked at the Truro Agricultural College and also incorporated archaeology into his agricultural investigations, collected artifacts from the site for several years after he and his wife first discovered the site. In 1955, Eaton contacted R.S. MacNeish to inform him about the site in Debert. MacNeish, who then served as the chief archaeologist at the National Museum of Canada, recorded the location of the site for further investigation after examining some of the specimens. E.S. Eaton would later sell his collection of specimens from multiple sites in eastern Canada to a collector from Kentville, Nova Scotia named W.A. Dennis. The collection was later stored at Mt. St.Vincent University following the death of Dennis, who left the collection to the university in his will. After reading Dennis‚Äôs note in the American Antiquity, Nova Scotia provincial archaeologist J.S. Erksine visited the site with E.S. Eaton to obtain additional material. The collection was later allocated to the Nova Scotia Museum of Science in Halifax Nova Scotia. In September 1962, D.S. Byers, the director of the R.S. Peabody Foundation for archaeology in Andover, Massachusetts, conducted a thorough test excavation that revealed undisturbed areas of the deposit. Following the thorough archaeological testing, Byers developed plans for a full scale excavation project in the summer of 1963 and again in the summer of 1964 with a larger group of excavators. These full scale excavations were directed by George Macdonald from the National Museum of Man. The Debert Paleo-Indian site eventually became listed as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1972. In late autumn of 1989, employees at the Department of Lands and Forests Tree Breeding Center in Debert noticed that their stumping operations could have been disturbing archaeological remains. Archaeologists from the Nova Scotia Museum and Saint Mary‚Äôs University checked the area following the concerns expressed about possible disturbance. During this check they discovered two new Paleo-Indian sites, which are now named Belmont I and Belmont II. Further excavations directed by Dr. Stephen Davis of Saint Mary‚Äôs University were performed at the new Belmont sites in 1990, where an undisturbed living floor was uncovered along with over 700 artifacts. These testings recovered the first fluted points within a buried context in Nova Scotia since 1964. The majority of artifacts discovered at the Belmont sites were virtually identical to those found at the Debert site, which suggests that the sites had possibly been occupied during the same time period.  Evidence of Palaeo-Indian Settlement  Evidence of First Peoples settlement at the Debert Palaeo Indian site has been found through examination of stone tools that are distinctive to Palaeo-Indian tool kits. Radiocarbon dating has determined that these distinctive stone tools existed approximately 10,600 years ago. Excavations recovered 4500 artifacts over 22 acres of land and found channel flutes that were consistent with the characteristics of hafted tools present on many Paleo-Indian sites. Channel fluting was a tool constructing method used by the Palaeo-Indians, which involved thinning the base of a tool by removing channel flakes so that stone tools like spear points could be attached to wood or bone shafts. Large stone knives that were possibly used to butcher caribou were also documented as strong evidence for Palaeo-Indian occupation at the Debert site, along with the small pointed or spurred end scrapers unique to the Palaeo-Indians. These end scrapers were likely used to cleanse animal hides. Further archaeological evidence suggests that the site served as a small seasonal hunting camp, possibly re-occupied over several generations. Due to the decomposition of organic materials, stone artifacts that have survived over many decades are recognized as the most frequently documented forms of evidence at the Debert site. Evidence of organic material has also been recovered from blood residue on hunting tools that archaeologists have identified as caribou.  Palaeo-Indian Migration Path and Life at the Site  The First Peoples are thought to have migrated into the Debert area just prior to the Younger Dryas stadial. The Palaeo- Indians possibly crossed the Bering Strait during and following the Wisconsinian Glacial Stage, where they then migrated to the southern regions of North America. Next, the Palaeo-Indians are thought to have gradually migrated east and north into what is now the Canadian Maritimes. Archaeologists have hypothesized that these early settlers were nomadic big game hunters who relied on migrating herds of caribou for survival. Small game such as fish and fowl would have also been an important food resource for the Palaeo-Indians. To survive the freezing cold climatic conditions, the early settlers likely wore tailored clothing and constructed skin covered tents with wooden frames for shelter.

He died after being attached to a cannon that was loaded with shrapnel and fired when the French fleet bombarded Algiers. Early years Jean Le Vacher was born on 15 March 1619 in √âcouen, France. His parents Philippe Le Vacher and Catherine Butefer had four boys and three girls by their marriage. Jean was the eldest. His younger brother Philippe was to also enter the Congregation of the Mission, commonly known as the Lazarites, and his youngest sister became a nun at the convent of Sainte-Marie. Jean Le Vacher was placed with a priest near Rouen who taught him the elements of Latin and instructed him in religion. He was then sent to Paris for his further studies. Le Vacher became engaged to marry, but the two families could not agree on the terms of the marriage contract. He met Vincent de Paul, who persuaded him to join the Lazarites. Le Vacher spent three years with his brother Philippe at Bons-Enfants studying ecclesiastical sciences. On 5 October 1643 both brothers offered themselves to Vincent de Paul, and were accepted. They both took holy vows in 1646. Tunis At the time, the Barbary states held many Christian slaves. Some converted to Islam, but others held onto their religion. A treaty was concluded by France with the Ottoman Porte that allowed the French to send a priest with their consuls. In November 1645 the priest Louis Gu√©rin was sent to Tunis, and began providing spiritual comfort to the slaves. Vincent de Paul sent Jean Le Vacher to Tunis in November 1647 to assist Gu√©rin. He arrived during an epidemic of the plague. He did much to comfort people of all classes, including slaves, merchants and Turks, who held him in great esteem. He fell sick himself and was expected to die, but recovered. In July 1648 the consul, L'Ange de Martin, became seriously ill. He sent for Le Vacher and asked him to take his place if he should die. Le Vacher refused, and the consul proposed to nominate one of the French merchants. However, they could not agree on a candidate. When the Bey was told of the problem, he also said that Le Vacher should become consul, and on the death of Martin he accepted this position. He was consul for five years while also acting as a missionary. Exhausted, Le Vacher won permission in 1653 to be relieved of his duties as consul and devoted himself solely to missionary work first in Tunis and then in Bizerte. He returned to Tunis, where he was again made consul, and where the Holy See named him Vicar Apostolic. Le Vacher was consul from 1648 until 1667, when he was succeeded by Jean Ambrozin. Algiers 1698 Dutch engraving of Le Vacher's death Bombardment of Algiers in 1682 Le Vacher returned to France and stayed for a while at the Priory of Saint-Lazare. In 1668 he was sent to Algiers, where he again had the dual roles of consul and missionary. He was appointed Consul of France at Algiers in 1676. On 4 September 1682 Admiral Abraham Duquesne arrived at Algiers to obtain the release of the French slaves held there. Le Vacher went on board the vice-admiral's ship, where he found Duquesne. He said he had been sent by the powers of the land, the Dey Mehemet Hadgi and the military chief Baba-Hassan, to find what Duquesne wanted. However, Dusquesne insisted on talking to a personal representative of the Dey. Duquesne continued to bombard Algiers from his galleys until 12 September 1682, when he judged that the sea would soon no longer be safe for galleys and decided to return to Toulon. In July 1683 Admiral Duquesne again bombarded the town. The French fire destroyed houses, mosques and ships. There was a palace revolution. The people seized any remaining Frenchmen. Le Vacher was falsely accused of treason, and was attached to the mouth of a cannon called Baba Merzoug. He died on 26 July 1683. On the orders of the usurper, known as Mezzomorto, he was tied to the mouth of a cannon, with twenty-two other French residents, and destroyed by shrapnel.Father Jean Le Vacher: Hero and Missionary, Blasted to Death by Muslims.

Nearly all of their production was for domestic use by their military, the police forces, and government-appointed agents. Founding (1888‚Äì1939) In 1888 the Colonial Ammunition Company of New Zealand founded an ammunition factory in Footscray, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. During World War One from 1915 to 1918 the plant made over 2 million rounds of rifle ammunition a year. It was purchased by the Australian government in 1927.Mayne, p. 58 The Defence Explosive Factory Maribyrnong opened in 1908. A factory annexe was built in 1912 to supply Footscray with domestically-produced cordite. It also had an ordnance annexe that produced artillery pieces, mortars, and shells. During World War One, the phrase \\"Made in Maribyrnong\\" referred to how central the town and its industries were to the Australian war effort. The Footscray plant's headstamp was originally CAC from 1888 to 1918 and ->CAC<\\\\- (the letters between two horizontal \\"Government Property\\" arrowheads) from 1918 to 1920. The headstamp was changed to ->SAAF<\\\\- (for \\"Small Arms Ammunition Factory\\") from 1921 to 1923 and one lot in March 1924, A‚ÜëF (\\"AF\\" for \\"Ammunition Factory\\", the letters flanking a vertical arrowhead) during 1924 to 1925, \\"‚ÜëF\\" (vertical arrowhead to the left of the F) from 1925 to 1926, and MF (for \\"Military Factory\\") from 1926 to 1945. Australian SAA Military Headstamp Codes, John Kindred World War Two production (1939‚Äì1945) In August, 1939, a plan was created to expand native ordnance production in case a war cut Australia off from the rest of the Commonwealth. The antiquated ammunition plant at Footscray was to be abandoned as soon as a more modern and efficient factory was built nearby. To differentiate between them, in 1940 the old factory briefly received the designation of Munitions Factory No.1 (MF1) and the new factory was designated Munitions Factory No.2 (MF2). Demand forced the old factory (later redesignated SAAF No.1) to remain open until the war's end. The new factory (now designated SAAF No. 2) would be the only one to remain open after the war. The plans to make one factory at Hendon was expanded to two factories (designated SAAFs No. 3 & No. 4) that were built only a few hundred metres apart. Conversely, the original plans to make two small factories at Rocklea (originally designated SAAFs No. 5 & No. 6) was abandoned and one large facility was made instead (SAAF No. 5). The sixth and last factory at Welshpool (originally to be designated SAAF No. 7) received the designation of SAAF No. 6. In 1940 the workforce at Footscray grew from a few hundred men to 6,000 men and women at its peak. Employees worked 12-hour shifts for six days a week. A women's hostel was opened across the street to house the female workforce and ensure continuous operation of the production lines. The Maribyrnong complex employed 20,000 men and women at its peak, with women making up 52% of the workforce. :Note: The acronym in parentheses following the factory's name is the facility's contractor code and headstamp. For example, a rifle cartridge with the headstamp \\"MH\\" was made at SAAF No.3 at Hendon. A 25-pounder shell casing with an \\"MR\\" headstamp was made at GAF Rutherford. Headstamp is the facility's code letters at 10 o'clock, the two- digit year of production at 2 o'clock, and the type and mark of cartridge at 6 o'clock.

The second Footscray facility was later redesignated from MG to MF in 1949. In 1986 Albion Explosives Factory was closed due to suburban encroachment. Production was moved to Mulwala Explosives Factory (MEF), New South Wales in 1988. Mulwala Explosives Factory was privatised in 2011 and then bought out by Thales Australia Ltd. In 1989 the Australian government nationalised munitions manufacture under a government-owned company called Australian Defence Industries (Ltd.).Mayne, p. 132 Its first round of business was to consolidate and regulate ordnance production. The Explosives Factory Maribyrnong complex was closed during restructuring later that year. Production at Ammunition Factory Footscray (AFF) was slowly wound down beginning in 1991 until it was closed in 1994.Mayne, pp. 132‚Äì133 A new factory run by Australian Defence Industries was opened elsewhere at Benalla, Victoria. When ADI was bought out by Thales in 2006, ADI was renamed Thales Australia Ltd. In 2012 Thales Australia spun off its factories at Benalla and Mulwalla to form the Australian Munitions group. It is also responsible for managing any Australian military logistical functions involving munitions.Thales Australia creates munitions group United Press International / Defense News Sept. 6, 2012 / 6:30 AM Benalla still uses the ADI headstamp from 1994 to as recently as 2014. Production of 5.56mm NATO F1 Ball resumed in 1995 and F1A1 Ball began in c.2010. Both cartridges are similar, but the F1A1 ammo has a green meplat tip and the headstamp has dimples at the 3 and 9 o'clock position (a peculiarity of the electric bunter used by the new cartridge-making machinery). 5.56mm NATO F3 Blank production began in 1998 and is produced in batches every three years. Production of .50 BMG M33 Ball began in 1999 and 7.62mm NATO F4 Ball began in 2008. Since they now only produce Ball ammunition, headstamps since 1995 only include the contractor code at 12 o'clock and the two-digit production year at 6 o'clock.

He won 13 British classics as a jockey, becoming champion in 1872. As a trainer, he trained classic winners, as well as winners over jumps, including the 1888 Grand National. He was the father of four jockey sons, including the six-times champion, Morny Cannon, and the great-grandfather of eleven-times champion, Lester Piggott. Early life Cannon was born in Eton, Berkshire in April 1846. His parents were Thomas H. Cannon and his wife, Harriett from Windsor. Thomas H. has been described variously as a livery stable keeper, horse dealer and keeper of the George Hotel in Eton. The young Cannon was a slight boy, lightweight and graceful. Career Jockey At 13, he was apprenticed to a trainer called Mr Sextie. His first race ride, aged 14, was in the Saltrom Handicap at Plymouth on Mavourneen, a four-year- old mare. That race ended in a fall, but within the week, he had had his first winner, a horse called My Uncle, owned by Lord Portsmouth in a six furlong heats race, also at Plymouth. After dead-heating in the second heat, he won the decider by a head. At this time, his race riding weight was a mere 3 st 12 lb (24.5 kg). For most of his career, Cannon was attached to the yard of John Day Jr., at Danebury by the side of Stockbridge Racecourse in Hampshire. There he was mentored by the jockey George Fordham, who was nine years his senior. Day provided Cannon with first classic win in the 1866 1,000 Guineas aboard a filly called Repulse. He also rode for his younger brother, Joseph Cannon and was associated with the stables of John Porter and James Ryan. Being a contemporary of both his mentor George Fordham and Fred Archer, who between them dominated the jockeys' championship for over 30 years, Cannon's own championship ambitions were limited. Nevertheless, he took the title in 1872 with a total of 87 wins. In fact, despite the feats of Fordham and Archer, it was said of Cannon that \\"for 35 years he had no superior as a horseman\\". In terms of classic wins, he could also hold his head up amongst those rivals. Most notably, he won the 2,000 Guineas and Derby, traditionally races for colts, on the fillies Pilgrimage and Shotover respectively, further enhancing his reputation as a master handler of fillies. He also won many of the major races in France. In 1887, after Archer's death, trainer John Porter turned to Cannon to take the ride on \\"horse of the century\\", Ormonde. Cannon thus took his part in one of racing's most memorable races, the 1887 Hardwicke Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. In what Lord Arthur Grosvenor called \\"the most splendid finish ever seen on a racecourse\\", Ormonde beat Minting by a neck with Bendigo further back. In the twilight of his riding career, he became retained jockey for Scottish millionaire, George Alexander Baird. Cannon's reputation was such that he was able to refuse the single year contract on offer and instead negotiate a three-year contract at ¬£3,000 per season, paid upfront. The best horse he rode for Baird was Busybody, who he also trained. In total, he rode 1,544 winners in his career as a jockey. Trainer Danebury Down, Hampshire, close to where Tom Cannon trained Cannon started dabbling in training while he was still a jockey. He worked from Day's stable, initially sharing, before taking over the running of it completely in 1879. After Day's death, he came to own the yard. In 1884, he recorded the remarkable feat of both training and riding Busybody to a Guineas/Oaks double. Cannon was also a dual purpose trainer, and trained the 1888 Grand National winner Playfair. He never matched his Derby wins as a jockey with similar wins as a trainer, but went close with Reminder, third in 1894, and Curzon, one place better the following year. He also dabbled in selling horses like his father had, selling Cesarewitch winner Humewood to Lord Rodney. Cannon garnered quite a reputation as a trainer of jockeys. In fact, it has been remarked that he was better at training jockeys than training horses. He tutored his sons - Tom Jr., Charles, Kempton (named after the racecourse) and Mornington (named after one of his mounts, and known as Morny) - in race-riding. Morny went on surpass even his father's achievements, winning the jockey's championship six times, whilst Kempton too won classics. Other riders to benefit from Cannon's tutelage included Sam Loates, John Watts, Jack Robinson, George Lambton and amateur rider Arthur Coventry. He rode against two of his sons - Tom Jr. and Morny before his retirement in 1891. His last race was on 11 August at Kempton, in the Hanworth Park Maiden Plate, where he finished third on Benedetto. The race was won by his son, Morny, on Sheldrake, the 3/1 favourite.The Yorkshire Herald, and The York Herald (York, England), 12 August 1891; pg. 8 After giving up training in 1892, he passed the stables over to his son, Tom Cannon Jr. In later life, Cannon became Clerk of the Course at Stockbridge. However, the demise of that venue, which closed when part of the land it lay on passed to a lady who disagreed with horse racing, also spelt the end of his training career, given Danebury's proximity to the course. He then purchased the Grosvenor Hotel, Stockbridge, Hampshire, where he lived out the remaining years of his life. The last horse that turned out in his silks was in 1913, long after he had retired from training. By then, Cannon was seriously ill, suffering from dropsy and heart trouble. He died on 13 July 1917 at the Grosvenor and left estate worth ¬£5,306 gross. Riding style Cannon has been described as \\"a beautiful horseman with the lightest of hands\\" and \\"imperturbable, a shrewd technician and a wonderful judge of pace.\\" Amongst his colleagues, he was regarded as a \\"polished\\" performer, and a peerless handler of young horses and, as he demonstrated with his multiple Oaks and 1,000 Guineas victories, of fillies. In 1887, it was said of Cannon: Conversely, what some saw as perfect finishing, other saw as the main fault in his riding - his habit of trying to win races by a narrow margin to protect a horse's handicap mark, which, when he got it wrong, was known to cost him winners. In contrast with some of the racing characters of the time, Cannon himself was a man of \\"irreproachable character\\" and, unlike his contemporaries, he was sparing with his use of the whip. Personal life Cannon first married Catherine, known as Kate, the daughter of his trainer John Day. When Kate died in 1891, he remarried. Besides his famous jockey sons, Cannon also had a daughter, Margaret. She married another jockey, Ernest Piggott, and became the grandmother of multiple Champion Jockey Lester Piggott.

Built in 1895, the house was designed in the Queen Anne style; it has been called \\"one of the largest and finest\\" houses in the style in Calaveras County. The front of the house has a raised central entrance with a porch; the porch's frieze is made up of turned spindles. A slanted bay with a large circular window is situated next to the entrance. The house has a gablet roof with a smaller gable over the front bay; the small gable includes a fan-shaped window surrounded by a roughcast infill decorated with colored glass and stones. John J. Snyder, the house's first owner, was an early settler of San Andreas who later became a district attorney in the area. Snyder lived in the house until his 1899 death. Snyder's wife Elizabeth lived in the house until 1938, after which the house became a rental property. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 2, 1984.
