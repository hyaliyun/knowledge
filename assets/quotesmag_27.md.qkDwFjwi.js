History Earthen Grave was founded late in 2008, as Jason Muxlow was working on a new album for The Living Fields, listening to a lot of Saint Vitus (an '80s doom metal band) and writing down various doom metal guitar riffs. Looking for who might be able to play this style of music with him, Muxlow reached out to drummer Scott Davidson, General Manager of Chicago's WPJX 'Rebel Radio' heavy metal radio station, and \\"things just snowballed.‚Äù They then enlisted bassist Ron Holzner, formerly of Trouble, to help with this new project. Muxlow says of the first jam as a trio, ‚ÄúThe first rehearsal was tough, but after we sorted out some issues with downtuning, things really jelled.‚Äù The trio put out a classified ad on craigslist.org looking for a vocalist, and Mark Weiner responded the very next day. Davidson, who had known violin virtuoso Rachel Barton Pine for many years through the Chicago metal scene, invited her to a rehearsal. Until this point in her career, Barton Pine had played only on a traditional acoustic violin, but participated in the band rehearsal using her new amplified six-string \\"Viper\\", an extended-range instrument related to the electric violin invented by Mark Wood. The band invited Barton Pine to join them shortly thereafter. Tony Spillman was the final member to join Earthen Grave, having previously worked with such bands as Ministry, Prong, and Trouble. In early June 2009, the band spent a weekend Farview Recording in St. Charles, IL and recorded their first demo, Dismal Times. On the evening of July 11, 2010, Earthen Grave performed at Chicago's Millennium Park as part of the Great Performers of Illinois celebration. In January 2011, the band was named the \\"2010 Best New Entertainer\\" at the Chicago Music Awards. On September 22, 2014 it was announced that Earthen Grave had disbanded. Media / Attention After releasing their demo EP, the band received promising attention from even mainstream media, and performed live on NBC's \\"Today\\" program on September 25, 2009 following a profile segment focusing on Barton Pine. The band also received a short profile on the Chicago Reader's The List (\\"Critics' Choices and other notable concerts\\") by local music critic Monica Kendrick, specifically noting the unique sound brought to the group by Barton Pine's violin. The band was also broadcast live December 16, 2009, on WGN-TV's \\"Midday News\\" program. Besides the level of media coverage unusual for the genre, the young Earthen Grave had, as of January 2010, already opened for some big names of metal, such as Megadeth, Pentagram and Anvil.

The graves of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn (right) and Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (left), the sixth and seventh Lubavitcher Rebbes, are piled with kvitelach left by visitors. Kvitel (, \\"little note\\"; plural ◊ß◊ï◊ï◊ô◊ò◊ú◊¢◊ö, kvitelach) refers to a practice developed by Hasidic Judaism in which a Hasid (a follower of Hasidic Judaism) writes a note with a petitionary prayer and gives it to a Rebbe (Hasidic Jewish leader) in order to receive the latter's blessing. This prayer may be a general request for health, livelihood, or success, or a specific request such as recovery from illness, the ability to bear children, a wedding match, etc. The writing, giving and reading of a kvitel is treated very seriously by Hasid and Rebbe alike, and is executed according to specific protocols. Because of their inherent sanctity, kvitelach may not be thrown away after use; they are either burned or buried. The practice of giving kvitelach continues today in all the Hasidic courts. Kvitelach are also placed on the graves of Rebbes and tzadikim (plural of \\"tzadik,\\" or Jewish holy man) with the hope that the soul of the deceased will intercede for the petitioner in Heaven. It is a centuries-old custom for Jews to place kvitelach containing personal prayers to God between the stones of the Western Wall in Jerusalem. This practice has been also adopted by Christian pilgrims and foreign dignitaries as well. More than a million prayer notes are placed in the Western Wall each year. Origin It is unclear when the practice of writing and giving kvitelach began. This practice is not mentioned in the writings of the early kabbalists, nor in the works of the school of Isaac Luria (1534‚Äì1572), the father of modern Kabbalah. The first time it is mentioned is during the time of the Baal Shem Tov (1698‚Äì1762), founder of Hasidism. Some scholars have suggested that the practice is based on Biblical commentator Nahmanides's (1194‚Äì1270) interpretation of the scriptural verse \\"And all those that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel\\" (). In his commentary on the Torah (the Five Books of Moses), Nahmanides contends that Moses asked each Jew to come before him to be counted. This personal appearance of the Jew before Moses, the tzadik (Jewish holy man), foreshadowed the ceremony of the giving of a kvitel by the Hasid to his Rebbe. Once the practice of giving kvitelach was established in Hasidic courts, it was treated very seriously. There were cases where Hasidic Jews hired a non-Jew to ride or travel to the Rebbe on Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath) to deliver a kvitel for a Jew who was ill, a clear violation of the Shabbat laws. Rabbi Sholom Mordechai Schwadron (1835‚Äì1911) once responded to a questioner who asked whether a Jew could send a telegram on behalf of a sick person on Shabbat: \\"In my hometown of Zlatshev, there was a desperately sick person. When the Belzer Rebbe (the Rebbe of the Belz Hasidic dynasty, Rabbi Sholom Rokeach) was in Brod for Shabbat, the local rabbi allowed the Jews to have a gentile write the name of the sick person and his mother's name and send this kvitel to Brod.\\" This action was vehemently protested by Rabbi Shlomo Kluger as well as by the Belzer Rebbe, and the rabbi was removed from his post. Procedure=Writing the kvitel In Hasidic courts, the kvitel is inscribed with the names of the petitioner and his family members, along with their specific requests. The form of the name is the person's full Hebrew name and his mother's Hebrew name (e.g. Shmuel ben Chana, \\"Shmuel the son of Chana\\"), even if the Rebbe already knows who he is. It is customary to write the kvitel on a blank, unlined piece of paper. Customs differ as to who writes the kvitel. In some courts, the Rebbe's attendant writes the kvitel on behalf of the petitioner; in others, a specific person is paid to write the kvitelach. Alternately, the petitioner himself writes the kvitel. Various customs arose around the writing of a kvitel. It is considered a bad omen if a kvitel falls on the ground, or if sand is placed on it. (Sand was commonly used as a drying agent for ink on paper.) Care is taken to write the kvitel without any mistakes, as Hasidic Jews believe that kvitelach contain deep secrets. Giving the kvitel The kvitel is either sent to the Rebbe by messenger or mail, or given personally by the Hasid during his private audience with the Rebbe. The kvitel is usually given together with a sum of money known as a pidyon (redemption), which is used by the Rebbe for the upkeep of his court or for distribution to charity. Some Rebbes requested from the Hasid a sum of money equal to twice the numerical value of the Hebrew word Chai (life), which equals 18. Others took an amount of money equal to the numerical value of the letters of the Hebrew names of the Hasid or his wife. Women are also welcome to visit a Rebbe and present their kvitelach to him. However, the Rebbe does not look at the woman directly while giving his blessing. The giving of the first kvitel cements the status of a newly appointed Hasidic Rebbe. In Belz tradition, the first kvitel to a new Rebbe is proffered by a follower of the Ropshitz Hasidic dynasty. Thus, when Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach assumed the mantle of leadership in 1894 after the death of his father, Rabbi Yehoshua Rokeach, he was given his first kvitel by Rabbi Yissachar Dov of Bisk, a follower of the Ropshitz dynasty. Thirty-three years later, following the funeral of Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, Rokeach's son and successor, Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, received his first kvitelach from Rabbi Yissachar Dov of Bisk and two other followers of the Ropshitz dynasty. The followers of the Ger Hasidic dynasty have in their possession the Kotzer Kvitel, a long note written by an elderly Hasid who had attended the courts of Rabbi Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter (the Sefas Emes), Rabbi Chanoch Henoch of Alexander, Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter (the Chiddushei Harim) and Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk. This Hasid presented the kvitel, containing his memories of these former Rebbes of the Ger dynasty, to Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter (the Imrei Emes) upon the latter's appointment as Rebbe of the Ger dynasty. Reading the kvitel If the kvitel is delivered by mail or messenger, the Rebbe's attendant reads it to the Rebbe. If the Hasid is present, the Rebbe reads the kvitel during their audience. Afterwards, the Rebbe blesses the petitioner. Rebbes traditionally devote their utmost attention to reading kvitelach. It was said of the Bohusher Rebbe, Rabbi Yitzchok Friedman, that when he read a kvitel, he put his whole being into the piece of paper before bestowing his blessing. The Satmar Rebbe, Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum, was known to scrutinize each kvitel and point out errors in the writing of names of people he had never met. Stories are told about Rebbes who were able to read into a kvitel the situations of those who were named in it. Once a bride-to-be and her mother visited the Bohusher Rebbe, Rabbi Yitzchok Friedman, for a blessing. The Rebbe's attendant wrote the kvitel hastily, noting next to the mother's name that she was about to marry. The Rebbe glanced at the kvitel and said, \\"She is already married.\\" When Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, the Belzer Rebbe, was hiding from the Nazis in the Krak√≥w Ghetto in 1942, he accepted a kvitel from one of the men who was assigned to protect him. As the names of the man's children were read aloud, the Rebbe continually stopped the reader when he reached a certain child's name and asked him to begin reading the kvitel again. This happened several times. Later the man learned that this son had died suddenly during the war, but the rest of his family survived.Israel, Yosef (2005), p. 221. It was said of \\"great Rebbes\\" that in their presence, petitioners would be struck with awe and would accidentally hand over a blank piece of paper instead of the kvitel. The Rebbe would read the blank page and understand exactly what the person wanted. In the court of Vizhnitz, it was known that if the Rebbe asked for a cigarette to smoke in the middle of reading a kvitel, it was a sign that the petitioner's request had been accepted. Rabbi Eliezer Dovid Friedman, a follower of the fourth Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager, witnessed this in 1965 when he delivered a kvitel to the Rebbe on behalf of a Melbourne Jew stricken with cancer and the Rebbe asked for a cigarette while reading the kvitel. The man recovered completely. However, in 1972, immediately after the death of the Rebbe, the Melbourne Jew fell ill with the same disease and succumbed to it.Freund, Rabbi Tuvia. The Imrei Chaim of Vizhnitz: Harav Chaim Meir Hager, zy\\"a. Hamodia Magazine, 24 March 2010, p. 6. At a grave Kvitelach left on the grave of the Baal Shem Tov in Medzhybizh, Ukraine. It is a common practice for Hasidic Jews to place kvitelach on the gravesite of a Rebbe or tzadik with the belief that the soul of the deceased will pray for them in Heaven.David M. Gitlitz & Linda Kay Davidson ‚Äò‚ÄôPilgrimage and the Jews‚Äô‚Äô (Westport: CT: Praeger, 2006), 107-109. The visitor usually sits beside the grave to write his kvitel and meditate on his request, and then tears the kvitel and throws it on top of the grave. Many graves of Jewish holy men are constructed with special apertures for the insertion of kvitelach. At the Western Wall A woman places a prayer note in the Wall. The kvitelach placed in the Western Wall differ from the kvitelach given in Hasidic courts, as they contain prayers, requests or messages written directly to God. These prayer notes are folded and wedged into the cracks and crevices of the Wall. The rationale for this practice has been traced to the Midrashic teaching that the Divine Presence has never moved from the Western Wall,Exodus Rabbah 2:2. and the Kabbalistic teaching that all prayers ascend to Heaven through the Temple Mount, which the Western Wall abuts.Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer 35: \\"Anyone who prays in this place in Jerusalem, it is as if he prayed before the Throne of Glory, for the gate of heaven is there, open to hear all prayers\\". More than a million prayer notes are placed in the Western Wall each year. Kvitelach wedged between the cracks of the Western Wall. The practice of placing prayer notes in the Western Wall has also been adopted by Christian pilgrims and people of other faiths. Foreign dignitaries who have publicly placed a kvitel in the Western Wall include Pope John Paul II in 2000, U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton in 2005, Pope Benedict XVI in 2008, U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama in 2008, and U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann in 2012. Pope Francis inserted a handwritten Spanish language text of the Lord's Prayer in the Wall during his visit in 2014. On May 22, 2017, Donald Trump became the first sitting U.S. President to visit the Wall; he also inserted a note. Based on the 11th century French rabbi Rabbeinu Gershom's ban against reading another person's mail, Jewish law forbids the reading of notes that have been inserted in the Western Wall.Shevet HaKehusi 1:315:1, quoted in Lebovits, Rabbi Moishe Dovid, \\"Reading Another Person's Mail\\", Hamodia Features, 6 January 2010, p. C3. Disposal Kvitelach may not be thrown away; there is a difference of opinion as to whether they should be burned or buried. According to Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch, Rabbi of the Western Wall and author of Minhagei HaKotel, a book of laws regarding the Western Wall, burning is a \\"pure\\" way to deal with the notes, but burying them is more honorable. Twice a year, Rabbi Rabinovitch and his assistants collect the hundreds of thousands of kvitelach left in the Wall and bury them in the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives. Kvitelach left at gravesites are traditionally burned. The gravesite of the sixth and seventh Lubavitcher Rebbes, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn and Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, includes a fax machine which receives over 700 faxes a day, and a computer which receives 400 emails daily. These kvitelach are all printed and then taken to the graves, where they are torn into shreds and placed atop the graves. When the pile grows too high, the shredded notes are burned. Electronic versions In today's electronic age, many online services offer petitioners the chance to send their kvitel to the Western Wall via email, fax, text messaging and Internet; the kvitel is then printed out and inserted in the cracks of the Wall. The \\"Send a Kvitel Service\\" of kevarim.com receives kvitelach via Internet and then dispatches them to the gravesites of tzadikim in North America with people who travel to these gravesites. The Nikolsburger Rebbe himself accepts kvitelach and pidyonos via Internet. Sending kvitelach to the grave of a Rebbe or tzadik has also become a fund-raising tool. Mosdos Kever Rachel (Kever Rachel Foundation) encourages donors to send messages and prayers which will be read out at Rachel's Tomb. Similarly, the Breslov Research Institute website offers donors the opportunity to send a \\"digital kvitel\\" to be read by the grave of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov in Uman, Ukraine.

It is one of the most common grasshoppers found in Mexico, the United States, and Canada.Red-legged grasshopper, USDA This grasshopper is frequently used as a model organism in scientific studies, due to their abundance throughout North America and behavioral response to changes in climate.  Identification  M. femurrubrum is a medium-sized grasshopper, in which males can range in length from - , whereas females can range from - long. This grasshopper has a reddish-brown back, a greenish-yellow belly, and red hind tibiae, hence its specific name femurrubrum (femur = thigh, rubrum = red). Wings of M. femurrubrum typically extend beyond the tip of the abdomen. Males have an enlarged abdomen, with a U-shaped sub-genital plate. Habitat M. femurrubrum can be found in a variety of habitats found throughout most of North America, but prefer grasslands and areas of thick vegetation. They are commonly found in disturbed habitats and old fields. Life Cycle Ottawa, Ontario M. femurrubrum, like other Orthoptera, undergo incomplete metamorphosis. This includes going through three stages of metamorphosis: egg, nymph, and adult. Adult female M. femurrubrum deposit eggs throughout autumn in the top 2 cm of the soil, where the eggs will develop until entering winter diapause. As the soil temperature increases during spring, the eggs will finish development and first instar nymphs will dig to the surface of the soil. M. femurrubrum nymphs will molt 5-7 times before its final molt, in which they will be considered adults, having fully functioning wings and sexual organs. This species of grasshopper is univoltine, meaning they have one generation per growing season; however, in their southern distribution, adults and nymphs can be found throughout the year and may have more than one generation throughout the year.  Diet  Melanoplus femurrubrum is a mixed-feeding herbivore, which means they can consume a variety of shrubs, forbs, and grasses to meet nutritional needs. This species dietary nutritional intake can vary depending on both abiotic and biotic factors. Consumption of plant macronutrient ratios of protein- carbohydrates fluctuate throughout the year to optimize available resources, and allows M. femurrubrum to compete with similar mix-feeding herbivores. Slight increases in temperature can increase food consumption, digestive efficiency, and metabolic rate of M. femurrubrum, which results in increased growth rates. In addition, M. femurrubrum will increase their plant carbohydrate intake and metabolic rate in the presence of predators, such as spiders. At high densities, M. femurrubrum can be considered a pest of gardens and agricultural crops. This grasshopper can become a pest of grains, and includes soybeans, alfalfa, wheat, and barley, among others. Melanoplus species eat grasses of all kinds, as well as leafy and grassy agricultural crops and garden plants. They feed on the leaves, and sometimes fruit, flowers, and buds, as well as tree bark.  Latitudinal gradient influence body size  With a higher latitude, the body size of Melanoplus Femurrubrum decreases. In the colder region, there is a shorter growing season which requires individuals to reach maturity at smaller sizes and develop faster so that they can reach the reproductive stage in one season, however, Melanoplus Femurrubrum has more time to complete the development stage at larger body size in the warmer site.

Style and structure \\"Ariel\\" is composed of ten three-line stanzas with an additional single line at the end, and follows an unusual slanted rhyme scheme. Literary commentator William V.

Context It has been speculated that, being written on her birthday as well as using the general theme of rebirth, \\"Ariel\\" acted as a sort of psychic rebirth for the poet. The poem, written just five months before her eventual suicide, thus, not surprisingly given its name as well, is one of her Ariel poems. \\"Ariel\\" was the name of the horse Plath rode at a riding school on Dartmoor in Devon.

Literary critic Kathleen Lant argues this routine is outlined in the second half of \\"Ariel\\", beginning with these lines: > White > Godiva, I unpeel -- > Dead hands, dead stringencies. This stanza, she argues, outlines her pre-dawn poetry writing, for in the poem these actions take place before the sun has risen, and because she is interpreting Plath's poetic \\"undressing\\" as an erotic metaphor for her undressing the structure to which she adhered before Ariel and The Colossus. This is seemingly further supported by another critic who argues that by \\"unpeeling\\" these dead \\"stringencies\\" she is taking off the Latinate diction which she had previously characterized much of her oeuvre of poetry, which some have argued as an earlier attempt to define herself a poetic identity. Thus, in this stanza she begins to undress her poetry, and then, as she continues, Plath begins to reach her climax, and undergo a sort of poetic orgasm in the next lines: > And now I > Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas. As she begins to fully thrust all this power and all of herself into these words and begin to form her new identity she becomes interrupted by her waking children, as portrayed in the next lines: \\"The child's cry/Melts in the wall.\\" and from then on she begins to fly \\"Suicidal\\" into the chores and drudgery that consumed the rest of her day, the \\"red/Eye, the cauldron of morning(/mourning).\\" Feminist The series of transformations she undergoes in this poem, as well as the actions she takes lend serious ground for feminist discussion. In the finale of the poem, as she builds up speed and tries to form herself a new identity, the i sound is repeated to represent the \\"I\\" of her identity: > The child's cry > > Melts in the wall. > And I > Am the arrow, > > The dew that flies > Suicidal, at one with the drive > Into the red > > Eye, the cauldron of morning. The words containing the i sound, cry, I, flies, suicidal, drive, Eye, all represent her thrusting her 'I'dentity into reality. From a feminist view point though, this poem is troubled. Earlier in the poem her \\"I\\"ness is repressed, for the \\"Nigger-eye\\" represents her \\"Nigger-\\"I\\"\\", for she is still repressed by her father or male dominance in general, as espoused in \\"Daddy\\". As the poem progresses, she begins a series of transformations out of this repressed self. First in the poem she becomes a stallion, a masculine image, the image of her repressor. Then as she picks up speed she becomes an arrow, a penetrating force which alongside her becoming \\"one with the drive\\" suggests she is becoming her rapist (her father) in order to prevent her submission and kill her father. Finally though, she loses this identity and breaks down into water, which Freud (who she was read up on) defines as a feminine symbol, as well as being a purifying substance. Ariel (left and right) enslaved to Prospero (centre) Psychological As stated above, the final \\"I\\"'s of the poem represent her \\"I\\"ness building up speed and force as she attempts to create herself a new identity through her Ariel poems. You can take all the lenses, the autobiographical, the feminist, the Freudian, and all others, and put them together, and view them as her attempt to take all the parts of her, her repression, her anger, her femininity, her creativity, and all else and forcefully drive them into existence with this poem in an attempt at \\"psychological reintegration\\". The subject itself, Ariel, can be seen as representing several different things, all symbolizing a different side of her, besides Ariel, her horse, which she rode every week and which had become a part of her, they are: *Ariel, Shakespeare's \\"airy spirit\\" an enslaved, creative spirit, representing her repression and creativity, *As literary essayist William Davis argues \\"I refer to \\"Ariel\\" as the symbolic name for Jerusalem.\\" for \\"Ariel\\" in Hebrew means \\"lion of God.\\" She begins the second stanza of the poem with the line \\"God‚Äôs lioness,\\" which seems to be a direct reference to the Hebrew or Jewish \\"Ariel.\\"\\", the Judaic inclusion representing her \\"obsession with Judaism and the Jewish people\\" * a stallion, as her attempt to become a masculine force further supported by a diary entry from the memoir of Laurie Levy, an associate editor of Plath's at Mademoiselle, which reads \\"S.[ylvia] thinks Ariel--animal power, fiery depths.\\" All these different Ariels representing different sides of her, the autobiographical references, as well as the feminist actions she describes, all are carried by the powerful \\"i\\" sound thrusting itself in the second half, driven into the dawn, into the sunlight, to try to create a new, unique identity, but ultimately fail to do so as she both evaporates into the sun as her final transformation, water, flies suicidal into it, and as the \\"cauldron of morning\\" represents all her specific identifiable parts all melting together into a uniform, homogeneous mixture in the cauldron of \\"morning\\". Critical reception Literary essayist William Davis describes \\"Ariel\\" as one of Plath's \\"most highly regarded, most often criticized, and most complicated poems\\". The poem has been critiqued by numerous literary figures and remains immortalized as the title poem to her most famous collection Ariel.

Torasan Meets his School-Mates and Tora-san's Heart of Gold is a 1976 Japanese comedy film directed by Yoji Yamada. It stars Kiyoshi Atsumi as Torajir≈ç Kuruma (Tora-san), and Machiko Ky≈ç as his love interest or \\"Madonna\\". (official site) Tora's Pure Love is the eighteenth entry in the popular, long- running Otoko wa Tsurai yo series, and was Machiko Ky≈ç's penultimate film appearance. Plot When Tora-san's infatuation with his nephew's school teacher causes family turmoil, he leaves on his travels again. When he returns, he falls in love with the teacher's mother, who has a terminal illness.

However, Stuart Galbraith IV writes that the film is disappointing in comparison with the previous Tora-san's Sunrise and Sunset (also 1976), more sentimental and less well-plotted than the earlier film. Galbraith judges Tora's Pure Love nevertheless to be funny, and enjoyable for the scenes between series star Kiyoshi Atsumi and actress Machiko Ky≈ç in one of her last appearances. The German-language site molodezhnaja gives Tora's Pure Love three and a half out of five stars. Availability Tora's Pure Love was released theatrically on December 25, 1976.

Peter Andreas Munch. Ludvig Kristensen Daa. The theory on immigration to Norway () refers to a theory on the origin of the Norwegian people. The theory is mainly associated with Rudolf Keyser, and developed by Peter Andreas Munch. Theory Following studies in Iceland from 1825 to 1827, Rudolf Keyser was appointed as a docent at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania, Norway in 1828. From the same year he worked with, and held lectures on, his theory on immigration to Norway. This theory was inspired by the works of Gerhard Sch√∏ning, who had released Afhandling om de Norskes og endeel andre Nordiske Folkes Oprindelse in 1769, and was first published in 1839 under the name Om Nordm√¶ndenes Herkomst og Folke-Sl√¶gtskab. In short, his theory stated that Norway as well as Northern Sweden had been populated by indigenous people from the north, whereas Denmark and Southern Sweden (south of G√∂taland) had been populated from the south. In other words, Norway was especially influenced by \\"Norse\\" people and culture, whereas parts of Sweden and particularly Denmark were influenced by \\"Gothic\\" peoples and culture. Norse people had, according to Keyser, drifted south towards Denmark as well, but here they had been mixed with Goths. He later supplemented the theory with a series of lectures in literary studies, printed posthumously, under the name Nordm√¶ndenes Videnskabelighed og Literatur i Middelalderen. Here, he stated that Norse literature was not Nordic, but Norwegian. Both the Norse and Gothic groups were taken to be Germanic peoples, having migrated from somewhere in the region of Ural and the Volga River. Peter Andreas Munch was a student of Keyser, and fellow proponent of the theory. He remarked that Gothic people inhabited some of South Norway as well. He too based the theory partly on linguistic traits, and also stated that the two groups had different approaches to liberty versus hierarchy. Reaction The theory was ill- received by many historians, especially those who did not subscribe to any form of Norwegian nationalistic agenda. The Danish historian Christian Molbech dubbed Keyser and Munch's viewpoint as \\"The Norwegian Historical School\\". The theory was also denounced by Norwegian historians. A lecture held by Ludvig Kristensen Daa on a Scandinavian conference in 1868 has been called \\"the graveside speech for the immigration theory\\". He released the work Have Germanerne indvandret til Skandinavien fra nord eller syd? in 1869.

A fullback who can also play on the wing, Prydie is the youngest player ever to represent the Wales national team and the youngest player in the history of Europe's top rugby union club competition, the Heineken Cup. Early life Born in Porthcawl, a seaside resort near Bridgend, Prydie primarily played football in his early childhood. However, Prydie represented his primary school, Nottage at under 11s rugby, within the Bridgend and District Schools' RU. He played for West Wales A (Under 11s) in their victory over East Wales at Virginia Park, Caerphilly RFC, on 10 April 2003. Prydie made his first ever appearance at the Millennium Stadium on 3 May 2003, when he represented Bridgend Schools' Under 11s v. Cardiff Schools' Under 11s, in the final of the DCThomas Cup. Ospreys His rise to prominence began in summer 2009, when he was noticed by Scott Johnson, the director of coaching for the Ospreys regional team. Prydie was then fast-tracked through the Ospreys age-grade system, and by the end of the year was in the senior side. He made his Ospreys senior debut on 12 December 2009 as a second-half replacement in their Heineken Cup match against Viadana. This made him the youngest player in Heineken Cup history at age , beating the previous record of Leicester Tigers' Richard Governley by 16 days.The Guardian.co.uk article incorrectly gives Prydie's age at the time of the match as 17 years, 293 days. London Wasps In January 2012 it was announced he along with Leicester's Lee Robinson would be joining London Wasps until the end of the season to cover injured duo Christian Wade and Tom Varndell Newport Gwent Dragons In May 2012 Prydie joined Newport Gwent DragonsPrydie joins Dragons He was released at the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season. International career On 18 January 2010 Prydie, aged 17, was a surprise inclusion in the 35-man Wales national squad named for the 2010 Six Nations despite playing just seven minutes for the Welsh region the Ospreys. Despite media speculation that Prydie would be named in the squad, he was still shocked at his selection. He was notified by a text message from Wales national coach Warren Gatland only 20 minutes before the public announcement of the squad; he initially thought that the message was part of an elaborate practical joke by some of his Ospreys teammates. At the time of his selection, Prydie had never met or spoken to Gatland. Prydie was named on the wing in the starting team for Wales' final 2010 Six Nations match against Italy and became the youngest cap in Wales' rugby history. The previous youngest to play for Wales was Norman Biggs, who was 18 years, 49 days old when he made his debut in 1888 against the New Zealand Natives. Prydie was old at the time of the Italy match on 20 March. Prydie, who by the time of the Italy match had made only two starts and played 167 minutes for the Ospreys senior side, also surpassed Mathew Tait of England as the youngest ever to play in the Six Nations. In June 2010 Prydie became Wales youngest try scorer at 18 years and 102 days against South Africa, overtaking the record set by Tom Pearson in 1891. In 2012 Prydie made his debut for the Wales under-20 team in the Junior World Championships, two years after making his debut for the Wales senior team. In May 2013 he was selected in the Wales national rugby union team 32-man training squad for the summer 2013 tour to Japan.Wales squad His appearance in the second test that year would be his last international appearance for Wales for five years before a surprise recall into the squad in for the 2018 June rugby union testsWales Summer Tour where he made a further two appearances against South Africa and Argentina.

A glider or sailplane is a type of glider aircraft used in the leisure activity and sport of gliding (also called soaring).FAA Glider handbookDefinition of gliders used for sporting purposes in FAI Sporting Code This unpowered aircraft can use naturally occurring currents of rising air in the atmosphere to gain altitude. Sailplanes are aerodynamically streamlined and so can fly a significant distance forward for a small decrease in altitude. In North America the term 'sailplane' is also used to describe this type of aircraft. In other parts of the English-speaking world, the word 'glider' is more common. Types of gliders ASH25M‚Äîa self-launching two-seater glider Sailplanes benefit from producing the least drag for any given amount of lift, and this is best achieved with long, thin wings, a fully faired narrow cockpit and a slender fuselage. Aircraft with these features are able to soar - climb efficiently in rising air produced by thermals or hills. In still air, sailplanes can glide long distances at high speed with a minimum loss of height in between. Sailplanes have rigid wings and either skids or undercarriage. In contrast hang gliders and paragliders use the pilot's feet for the start of the launch and for the landing. These latter types are described in separate articles, though their differences from sailplanes are covered below. Sailplanes are usually launched by winch or aerotow, though other methods, auto tow and bungee, are occasionally used. These days almost all gliders are sailplanes, but in the past many gliders were not. These types did not soar. They were simply engine-less aircraft towed by another aircraft to a desired destination and then cast off for landing. The prime example of non-soaring gliders were military gliders (such as those used in the Second World War). They were often used just once and then usually abandoned after landing, having served their purpose. Motor gliders are gliders with engines which can be used for extending a flight and even, in some cases, for take-off. Some high- performance motor gliders (known as \\"self-sustaining\\" gliders) may have an engine-driven retractable propeller which can be used to sustain flight. Other motor gliders have enough thrust to launch themselves before the engine is retracted and are known as \\"self-launching\\" gliders. Another type is the self- launching \\"touring motor glider\\", where the pilot can switch the engine on and off in flight without retracting the propeller. History HAWA Vampyr 1921 Sir George Cayley's gliders achieved brief wing-borne hops from around 1849.Flight magazine 1954 In the 1890s, Otto Lilienthal built gliders using weight shift for control. In the early 1900s, the Wright Brothers built gliders using movable surfaces for control. In 1903, they successfully added an engine. After World War I gliders were first built for sporting purposes in Germany. Germany's strong links to gliding were to a large degree due to post- WWI regulations forbidding the construction and flight of motorised planes in Germany, so the country's aircraft enthusiasts often turned to gliders and were actively encouraged by the German government, particularly at flying sites suited to gliding flight like the Wasserkuppe. The sporting use of gliders rapidly evolved in the 1930s and is now their main application. As their performance improved, gliders began to be used for cross-country flying and now regularly fly hundreds or even thousands of kilometres in a dayOn-line contest web page if the weather is suitable. Glider design Early gliders had no cockpit and the pilot sat on a small seat located just ahead of the wing. These were known as \\"primary gliders\\" and they were usually launched from the tops of hills, though they are also capable of short hops across the ground while being towed behind a vehicle. To enable gliders to soar more effectively than primary gliders, the designs minimized drag. Gliders now have very smooth, narrow fuselages and very long, narrow wings with a high aspect ratio and winglets. De-rigged glider in its trailer for storage and road transport The early gliders were made mainly of wood with metal fastenings, stays and control cables. Later fuselages made of fabric-covered steel tube were married to wood and fabric wings for lightness and strength. New materials such as carbon-fiber, fiber glass and Kevlar have since been used with computer-aided design to increase performance. The first glider to use glass-fiber extensively was the Akaflieg Stuttgart FS-24 Ph√∂nix which first flew in 1957. This material is still used because of its high strength to weight ratio and its ability to give a smooth exterior finish to reduce drag. Drag has also been minimized by more aerodynamic shapes and retractable undercarriages. Flaps are fitted to the trailing edges of the wings on some gliders to optimise lift and drag at a wide range of speeds. With each generation of materials and with the improvements in aerodynamics, the performance of gliders has increased. One measure of performance is the glide ratio. A ratio of 30:1 means that in smooth air a glider can travel forward 30 meters while losing only 1 meter of altitude. Comparing some typical gliders that might be found in the fleet of a gliding club ‚Äì the Grunau Baby from the 1930s had a glide ratio of just 17:1, the glass-fiber Libelle of the 1960s increased that to 36:1, and modern flapped 18 meter gliders such as the ASG29 have a glide ratio of over 50:1. The largest open-class glider, the eta, has a span of 30.9 meters and has a glide ratio over 70:1. Compare this to the Gimli Glider, a Boeing 767 which ran out of fuel mid-flight and was found to have a glide ratio of 12:1, or to the Space Shuttle with a glide ratio of 4.5:1.Space Shuttle Technical Conference pg 258 Left wing spar being inserted during rigging High aerodynamic efficiency is essential to achieve a good gliding performance, and so gliders often have aerodynamic features seldom found in other aircraft. The wings of a modern racing glider are designed by computers to create a low-drag laminar flow airfoil. After the wings' surfaces have been shaped by a mould to great accuracy, they are then highly polished. Vertical winglets at the ends of the wings decrease drag and so improve wing efficiency. Special aerodynamic seals are used at the ailerons, rudder and elevator to prevent the flow of air through control surface gaps. Turbulator devices in the form of a zig-zag tape or multiple blow holes positioned in a span-wise line along the wing are used to trip laminar flow air into turbulent flow at a desired location on the wing. This flow control prevents the formation of laminar flow bubbles and ensures the absolute minimum drag. Bug- wipers may be installed to wipe the wings while in flight and remove insects that are disturbing the smooth flow of air over the wing. Modern competition gliders carry jettisonable water ballast (in the wings and sometimes in the vertical stabilizer). The extra weight provided by the water ballast is advantageous if the lift is likely to be strong, and may also be used to adjust the glider's center of mass. Moving the center of mass toward the rear by carrying water in the vertical stabilizer reduces the required down-force from the horizontal stabilizer and the resultant drag from that down-force. Although heavier gliders have a slight disadvantage when climbing in rising air, they achieve a higher speed at any given glide angle. This is an advantage in strong conditions when the gliders spend only a small amount of time climbing in thermals. The pilot can jettison the water ballast before it becomes a disadvantage in weaker thermal conditions. Another use of water ballast is to dampen air turbulence such as might be encountered during ridge soaring. To avoid undue stress on the airframe, gliders must jettison any water ballast before landing. Most gliders are built in Europe and are designed to EASA Certification Specification CS-22 (previously Joint Aviation Requirements-22). These define minimum standards for safety in a wide range of characteristics such as controllability and strength. For example, gliders must have design features to minimize the possibility of incorrect assembly (gliders are often stowed in disassembled configuration, with at least the wings being detached). Automatic connection of the controls during rigging is the common method of achieving this. Double aerotow Winch-launch of glider ASK 13 Airport Albstadt-Degerfeld airfield Launch and flight The two most common methods of launching sailplanes are by aerotow and by winch. When aerotowed, the sailplane is towed behind a powered aircraft using a rope about 60 meters (about 200 ft) long. The sailplane pilot releases the rope after reaching the desired altitude. However, the rope can be released by the towplane also in case of emergency. Winch launching uses a powerful stationary engine located on the ground at the far end of the launch area. The sailplane is attached to one end of 800‚Äì1200 metres (about 2,500‚Äì4,000 ft) of cable and the winch rapidly winds it in. The sailplane can gain about 900‚Äì3000 feet (about 300‚Äì900 metres) of height with a winch launch, depending on the headwind. Less often, automobiles are used to pull sailplanes into the air, either by pulling them directly or through the use of a reverse pulley in a similar manner to the winch launch. Elastic ropes (known as bungees) are occasionally used at some sites to launch gliders from slopes, if there is sufficient wind blowing up the hill. Bungee launching was the predominant method of launching early gliders. Some modern gliders can self-launch with the use of retractable engines and/or propellers, which can also be used to sustain flight once airborne (see motor glider). Once launched, gliders try to gain height using thermals, ridge lift, lee waves or convergence zones and can remain airborne for hours. This is known as \\"soaring\\". By finding lift sufficiently often, experienced pilots fly cross-country, often on pre- declared tasks of hundreds of kilometers, usually back to the original launch site. Cross-country flying and aerobatics are the two forms of competitive gliding. For information about the forces in gliding flight, see lift-to-drag ratio. Glide slope control Pilots need some form of control over the glide slope to land the glider. In powered aircraft, this is done by reducing engine thrust. In gliders, other methods are used to either reduce the lift generated by the wing, increase the drag of the entire glider, or both. Glide slope is the distance traveled for each unit of height lost. In a steady wings-level glide with no wind, glide slope is the same as the lift/drag ratio (L/D) of the glider, called \\"L-over-D\\". Reducing lift from the wings and/or increasing drag will reduce the L/D allowing the glider to descend at a steeper angle with no increase in airspeed. Simply pointing the nose downwards only converts altitude into a higher airspeed with a minimal initial reduction in total energy. Gliders, because of their long low wings, create a high ground effect which can significantly increase the glide angle and make it difficult to bring the glider to Earth in a short distance. ;Sideslipping: A slip is performed by crossing the controls (rudder to right with ailerons to left, for example) so that the glider is no longer flying aligned with the air flow. This will present one side of the fuselage to the air-flow significantly increasing drag. Early gliders primarily used slipping for glide slope control. ;Spoilers: Spoilers are movable control surfaces in the top of the wing, usually located mid-chord or near the spar which are raised into the air-flow to eliminate (spoil) the lift from the wing area behind the spoiler, disrupting the spanwise distribution of lift and increasing lift-induced drag. Spoilers significantly increase drag. ;Air brakes: Air brakes, also known as dive brakes, are devices whose primary purpose is to increase drag. On gliders, the spoilers act as air brakes. They are positioned on top of the wing and below the wing also. When slightly opened the upper brakes will spoil the lift, but when fully opened will present a large surface and so can provide significant drag. Some gliders have terminal velocity dive brakes, which provide enough drag to keep its speed below maximum permitted speed, even if the glider were pointing straight down. This capability is considered a safer way to descend without instruments through cloud than the only alternative which is an intentional spin. ;Flaps: Flaps are movable surfaces on the trailing edge of the wing, inboard of the ailerons. The primary purpose of flaps is to increase the camber of the wing and so increase the maximum lift coefficient and reduce the stall speed. Another feature that some flapped gliders possess is negative flaps that are also able to deflect the trailing edge upward a small amount. This feature is included on some competition gliders in order to reduce the pitching moment acting on the wing and so reduce the downwards force that must be provided by the horizontal stabiliser; this reduces the induced drag acting on the stabilizer. On some types the flaps and ailerons are linked, known a 'flaperons'. Simultaneous movement of these allows a greater rate of roll. ;Parachute: Some high performance gliders from the 1960s and 1970s were designed to carry a small drogue parachute because their air brakes were not particularly effective. This was stored in the tail-cone of the glider during flight. When deployed, a parachute causes a large increase in drag, but has a significant disadvantage over the other methods of controlling the glide slope. This is because a parachute does not allow the pilot to finely adjust the glide slope. Consequently, a pilot may have to jettison the parachute entirely, if the glider is not going to reach the desired landing area. Landing Early glider designs used skids for landing, but modern types generally land on wheels. Some of the earliest gliders used a dolly with wheels for taking off and the dolly was jettisoned as the glider left the ground, leaving just the skid for landing. A glider may be designed so the center of gravity (CG) is behind the main wheel so the glider sits nose high on the ground. Other designs may have the CG forward of the main wheel so the nose rests on a nose-wheel or skid when stopped. Skids are now mainly used only on training gliders such as the Schweizer SGS 2‚Äì33. Skids are around 100mm (3 inches) wide by 900mm (3 feet) long and run from the nose to the main wheel. Skids help with braking after landing by allowing the pilot to put forward pressure on the control stick, thus creating friction between the skid and the ground. The wing tips also have small skids or wheels to protect the wing tips from ground contact. In most high performance gliders the undercarriage can be raised to reduce drag in flight and lowered for landing. Wheel brakes are provided to allow stopping once on the ground. These may be engaged by fully extending the spoilers/air-brakes or by using a separate control. Although there is only a single main wheel, the glider's wing can be kept level by using the flight controls until it is almost stationary. Pilots usually land back at the airfield from which they took off, but a landing is possible in any flat field about 250 metres long. Ideally, should circumstances permit, a glider would fly a standard pattern, or circuit, in preparation for landing, typically starting at a height of 300 metres (1,000 feet). Glide slope control devices are then used to adjust the height to assure landing at the desired point. The ideal landing pattern positions the glider on final approach so that a deployment of 30‚Äì60% of the spoilers/dive brakes/flaps brings it to the desired touchdown point. In this way the pilot has the option of opening or closing the spoilers/air-brakes to extend or steepen the descent to reach the touchdown point. This gives the pilot wide safety margins should unexpected events occur. If such control devices are not sufficient, the pilot may utilize manouvours such as a forward slip to further steepening the glider slope. Auxiliary engines Most gliders require assistance to launch, though some have an engine powerful enough to launch unaided. In addition, a high proportion of new gliders have an engine which will sustain the glider in the air, but is insufficiently powerful to launch the glider. Compared with self-launchers these lower powered engines have advantages in weight, lower costs and pilot licensing. The engines can be electric, jet, two-stroke gasoline.

Click on image to see a detailed description (Schempp-Hirth Ventus 3) Gliders in continental Europe use metric units, like km/h for airspeed and m/s for lift and sink rate. In the USA, UK, Australia and some other countries gliders to use knots and ft/min in common with commercial aviation worldwide. In addition to an altimeter, compass, and an airspeed indicator, gliders are often equipped with a variometer and an airband radio (transceiver), each of which may be required in some countries. A transponder may be installed to assist controllers when the glider is crossing busy or controlled airspace. This may be supplemented by ADS-B. Without these devices access to some airspace may become increasing restricted in some countries. In countries where cloud-flying is allowed an artificial horizon or a turn and slip indicator are used when there is zero visibility. Increasingly anti-collision warning systems such as FLARM are also used and are even mandatory in some European countries. An Emergency Position- Indicating Radio Beacon (ELT) may also be fitted into the glider to reduce search and rescue time in case of an accident. Much more than in other types of aviation, glider pilots depend on the variometer, which is a very sensitive vertical speed indicator, to measure the climb or sink rate of the plane. This enables the pilot to detect minute changes caused when the glider enters rising or sinking air masses. Most often electronic 'varios' are fitted to a glider, though mechanical varios are often installed as back-up. The electronic variometers produce a modulated sound of varying amplitude and frequency depending on the strength of the lift or sink, so that the pilot can concentrate on centering a thermal, watching for other traffic, on navigation, and weather conditions. Rising air is announced to the pilot as a rising tone, with increasing pitch as the lift increases. Conversely, descending air is announced with a lowering tone, which advises the pilot to escape the sink area as soon as possible. (Refer to the variometer article for more information). Variometers are sometimes fitted with mechanical or electronic devices to indicate the optimal speed to fly for given conditions. The MacCready setting can be input electronically or adjusted using a ring surrounding the dial. These devices are based on the mathematical theory attributed to Paul MacCready though it was first described by Wolfgang Sp√§te in 1938. MacCready theory solves the problem of how fast a pilot should cruise between thermals, given both the average lift the pilot expects in the next thermal climb, as well as the amount of lift or sink encountered in cruise mode. Electronic variometers make the same calculations automatically, after allowing for factors such as the glider's theoretical performance, water ballast, headwinds/tailwinds and insects on the leading edges of the wings. Soaring flight computers running specialized soaring software, have been designed for use in gliders. Using GPS technology in conjunction with a barometric device these tools can: * Provide the glider's position in 3 dimensions by a moving map display * Alert the pilot to nearby airspace restrictions * Indicate position along track and remaining distance and course direction * Show airports within theoretical gliding distance * Determine wind direction and speed at current altitude * Show historical lift information * Create a GPS log of the flight to provide proof for contests and gliding badges * Provide \\"final\\" glide information (i.e., showing if the glider can reach the finish without additional lift). * Indicate the best speed to fly under current conditions After the flight the GPS data may be replayed on computer software for analysis and to follow the trace of one or more gliders against a backdrop of a map, an aerial photograph or the airspace. Swift S-1 of the UK Swift Aerobatic Display Team at Kemble 2009 Markings So that ground-based observers may identify gliders in flight or in gliding competition, registration marks (\\"insignias\\" or \\"competition numbers\\" or \\"contest ID\\") are displayed in large characters on the underside of a single wing, and also on the fin and rudder. Registration marks are assigned by gliding associations such as the US Soaring Society of America, and are unrelated to national registrations issued by entities such as the US Federal Aviation Administration.Reference to competition numbers on FAI web site This need for visual ID has somewhat been supplanted by GPS position recording. Insignias are useful in two ways: First, they are used in radio communications between gliders, as pilots use their competition number as their call signs. Secondly, to easily tell a glider's contest ID when flying in close proximity to one another to alert them of potential dangers. For example, during gatherings of multiple gliders within thermals (known as \\"gaggles\\"), one pilot might report \\"Six-Seven-Romeo I am right below you\\". Fibreglass gliders are invariably painted white to minimise their skin temperature in sunlight. Fibreglass resin loses strength as its temperature rises into the range achievable in direct sun on a hot day. Color is not used except for a few small bright patches on wing tips; these patches (typically orange or red) improving a glider's visibility to pilots while in flight. Such patches are obligatory for mountain flying in France.Gliding In France Non-fibreglass gliders made of aluminum and wood are not so subject to deterioration at higher temperatures and are often quite brightly painted.  Comparison of sailplanes with hang gliders and paragliders  There is sometimes confusion about gliders, hang gliders and paragliders. In particular, paragliders and hang gliders are both foot-launched. The main differences between the types are: Competition classes of glider DG Flugzeugbau DG-1000 of the Two Seater Class Eight competition classes of glider have been defined by the FAI.Competition classes as defined by FAI They are: * Standard Class (No flaps, 15 m wing-span, water ballast allowed) * 15 metre Class (Flaps allowed, 15 m wing-span, water ballast allowed) * 18 metre Class (Flaps allowed, 18 m wing-span, water ballast allowed) * Open Class (No restrictions except a limit of 850 kg for the maximum all-up weight) * Two Seater Class (maximum wing-span of 20 m), also known by the German name \\"Doppelsitzer\\" * Club Class (This class allows a wide range of older small gliders with different performance, so the scores have to be adjusted by handicapping. Water ballast is not allowed). * World Class (The FAI Gliding Commission which is part of the FAI and an associated body called Organisation Scientifique et Technique du Vol √† Voile (OSTIV) announced a competition in 1989 for a low-cost glider, which had moderate performance, was easy to assemble and to handle, and was safe for low hours pilots to fly. The winning design was announced in 1993 as the Warsaw Polytechnic PW-5. This allows competitions to be run with only one type of glider. * Ultralight Class, for gliders with a maximum mass less than 220 kg. Major manufacturers of gliders A large proportion of gliders have been and are still made in Germany, the birthplace of the sport. In Germany there are several manufacturers but the three principal companies are: * DG Flugzeugbau GmbH * Schempp-Hirth GmbH * Alexander Schleicher GmbH & Co Germany also has Stemme and Lange Aviation. Elsewhere in the world, there are other manufacturers such as Jonker Sailplanes in South Africa, Sportinƒó Aviacija in Lithuania, Allstar PZL in Poland, HpH in the Czech Republic and AMS Flight in Slovenia.

Its formation occurred after a series of diving fatalities in waterfilled caves and sinkholes in the Mount Gambier region between 1969 and 1973 and in parallel to a South Australian Government inquiry into these deaths. The CDAA's major achievement has been the dramatic reduction of fatalities via the introduction of a site rating scheme and an associated testing system which was brought in during the mid-1970s. While its major area of operation is in the Limestone Coast region of SA, it administers and supports cave diving activity in other parts of Australia including the Nullarbor Plain and Wellington, New South Wales. Organisation and purpose The CDAA is a nationally based organisation without state or territory branches and which is managed on a day-to-day basis by the National Committee ‚Äì an executive consisting of five directors who are elected bi-annually. It is incorporated in SA as an incorporated association. Its purpose is concerned with fostering ‚Äòthe development, advancement, promotion, mapping, education, exploration, conservation, safety and research of underwater caves and related features.‚Äô As dive sites are on either controlled Government or private property, one of the CDAA's key functions is to liaise with landowners to organise access for its members to enter and dive. The CDAA also owns a cave diving site, Tank Cave, which is located near Tantanoola and which was purchased in 2011. Origins=Background From the late 1950s onwards, the Lower South East of SA became a popular destination for recreational scuba diving due to the presence of very clear water and easy access to deep water. However, this activity was completely unregulated. From 1969 to 1974, 11 people died at the following four cave diving sites: Kilsbys Sinkhole (two fatalities), Piccaninnie Ponds (two fatalities), Alleyns Cave (three fatalities) and The Shaft (four fatalities). The 1973 South Australian Government inquiry  Immediately following the multiple fatality in The Shaft on 28 May 1973, Des Corcoran, the SA Deputy Premier, announced the appointment of a committee to ‚Äòinvestigate safety precautions for Scuba Divers in Fresh water Sinkholes and Underwater Caves‚Äô and which consisted of three government officers ‚Äì L.D. Draper (Chair), R.J. Wight (Secretary), G .C. Cornwall, and three representatives from the SA recreational diving community ‚Äì D.G. Burchell, P.G. Christopher and R.C. Pulford. In January 1974, the Committee offered five recommendations. Firstly, the creation of a government advisory body to essentially encourage a higher standard of cave diving practice by the recreational diving community; secondly, the publication and distribution of educational material to improve the awareness of cave diving safety; thirdly, the installation of warning signs at sinkhole and cave sites; fourthly, the sealing of Alleyns Cave (also known as the Death Cave) to prevent access and finally, in the case of the failure of the first three recommendations to reduce fatalities, consideration of control by legislative measures. The fifth recommendation suggested measures such as the licensing of instructors, an access permit system and the use of patrol officers to manage sites. In April 1974, the SA Government announced that it would proceed with the recommendations of the committee including the creation of an advisory body. Foundation of the CDAA On 11 July 1973, after giving evidence to the Committee, a group of divers from the Lower South East, other parts of SA, Victoria and New South Wales met in Mount Gambier to agree to form the Cave Divers Association of Australia. At a subsequent meeting in Mount Gambier on 29 September 1973, the organisation was officially formed. Its formation is attributed to a desire amongst divers to have a ‚Äòunified voice‚Äô in order to defend cave diving and to demonstrate to both the landowners and the public a willingness and an ability to regulate their own affairs to achieve safer cave diving practice. In a letter dated 21 October 1973 to the Committee, the CDAA officially announced its existence, that it was formed by divers experienced in sinkhole and cave diving who all agreed that \\"all members should be safety conscious and fully conversant in the use of scuba‚Ä¶\\" and that \\"inexperienced divers must not be permitted to dive without tuition under the guidance of an experienced cave diver\\". It also advised that it intended to incorporate in SA, create an instructor body, create a permit system for access and to approach all landowners (including government) to seek their support for exclusive access by CDAA members. Certification of divers=The testing system In 1974, the newly formed CDAA devised a testing system that was intended to gain the confidence of the owners of the land on which most popular sinkholes and caves sites were located. This system assessed the ability of a diver to safely dive in cave sites against a rating system that divided these sites into three levels of difficulty. Firstly, popular cave diving sites were assessed against a rating system that divided these sites into the following three levels of difficulty: Category 1, i.e. open, deep- water caverns or sinkholes with minimal if any overhang or ceiling, Category 2, i.e. similar deep holes with considerable overhangs and Category 3, i.e. with a lot more penetration under flooded ceilings, and more severe silting potential. Secondly, divers with a minimum level of certification and minimum experience were qualified by attending a theory and a practical examination. A successful result in both examinations resulted in the awarding of a combined membership and certification card for either Category 1, 2 or 3. A fourth category known as Advanced Category 3 (subsequently renamed Category 4) was introduced to include cave sites which were almost entirely flooded or which had areas that were unsuitable for two divers to negotiate at the same time. During the years of the testing system's operation, there were only three deaths which all occurred as part of two accidents in Piccaninnie Ponds during the years 1974 and 1984. The relative success of the system showed that CDAA had been very successful in ensuring that prospective cave divers have met minimum standards of training for cave diving. The training system In 1989, the CDAA replaced its testing system with a training and qualification system based on four new site categories as part of a restructure of its overall operation. The CDAA training system=The 1989 system The training system which was introduced in 1989 was based on the following four new site categories. Cavern ‚Äì a Cavern is defined as body of water which has a maximum depth of 20 metres and may contain overhangs or near vertical ascents where daylight is always visible (i.e. limestone caverns, dams, flooded quarries, lakes etc.). The maximum linear penetration allowed is 40m from the surface. This replaced the Category 1 rating.CDAA Deep Cavern Training, Cave Divers Association of Australia Website, \\" \\" Sinkhole ‚Äì a Sinkhole is defined as a body of fresh water which can have large passages (no restrictions too small for two divers to swim adjacent to each other) and which exceeds 20m in depth. The maximum linear penetration allowed is 60m from the surface. The CDAA recommends a maximum depth of 40m on air. This replaced the Category 2 rating.CDAA Deep Cavern Training, Cave Divers Association of Australia Website, \\" \\" Cave ‚Äì a Cave is defined as an enclosed body of water containing overhangs, silt, darkness zones and passages that are still large enough for two divers to swim adjacent to each other. Cave sites allow a maximum penetration of 1/3 of a twin cylinder gas supply. This replaced the Category 3 rating.

This replaced the Category 4 rating.CDAA Advance Training, Cave Divers Association of Australia Website, \\" \\" 2007 changes The Cavern and Sinkhole qualifications were merged in 2007 to create a new qualification called Deep Cavern while the Penetration qualification was substantially revised in 2009 and renamed as Advanced Cave. 2017 changes In December 2017, the Deep Cavern qualification was replaced with a new qualification called Basic Cave as part of the following changes to the training system: *The Basic Cave syllabus does not include the requirement for a maximum depth of during training in order to encourage the use of this level of cave diving training in other parts of Australia where depths of cannot be achieved. A diver with a Basic Cave is limited to the maximum depth achieved during training and may need to do additional deep diving training if they wish to dive in sites with depths greater than those dived during training. *The expansion of an existing recognition system of training by organisations other than the CDAA (known as an \\"endorsement\\") from nitrox, trimix & rebreather to include training such as deep diving, side-mount and scooters to both meet the needs of Basic Cave divers and the operators of cave diving sites in other parts of the world requesting evidence of training appropriate to their sites *The ability to do CDAA Advanced Cave training at sites outside of Australia using a network of cave diving instructors approved by the CDAA. The effectiveness of the training system Since the advent of the training system in 1989, three divers have died while diving in CDAA-rated sites in the Limestone Coast. The three fatalities occurred in Kilsby Sinkhole during March 2010, and in Tank Cave during February 2011 and October 2011. As of March 2013, the Coroner's Court of South Australia had not reported on these deaths. Recognition of other training As of October 2013, most inland cave sites in Australia can only be accessed by CDAA members because the access negotiated by the CDAA usually includes the obligation to indemnify the landowner via waiver and insurance. The CDAA does recognise training provided by other organisations that is comparable to its own and will permit access via the following avenues. For divers visiting from outside of Australia, the CDAA may grant a visitor's pass which is effectively a temporary CDAA membership, for the purpose of accessing dive sites under the CDAA's authority. For individuals wishing to cross over and become a permanent member, the CDAA will recognise training from certain other organisations and individuals can apply for CDAA membership including receipt of qualification at a level comparable to their current level of training. Sites Diving in Piccaninnie Ponds The sites rated by the CDAA are located in the Limestone Coast region of SA, New South Wales, the Northern Territory and the Nullarbor Plain in Western Australia.

He also invested in and organized transportation and utility companies in the Houston area. He was a veteran of the Texas Revolution and provided financial assistance to the Confederacy during the American Civil War. He was mayor of Houston, Texas in 1862. Revised. Family life House was born on March 4, 1814 in Stoke St Gregory, Somerset, England. His family are of Anglo-Saxon, possibly Norse, origin (from the Old English and Old Norse h≈´s). In 1840, House married Mary Elizabeth Shearn, the daughter of his business partner, Charles Shearn. One of their sons, Edward Mandell House, served President Woodrow Wilson's administration. Early business life In May 1835, House emigrated to New York City. There, he became a successful pastry maker. In 1836, House accepted an invitation from the owner of the St. Charles Hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana to run the bakery at the hotel. In 1836, he moved to Texas to fight in the Revolution against Mexico. He was rewarded with a land grant in Coryell County. In 1838, he opened his own store, House and Loveridge, a bakery and confectionary in Houston, Texas. The next year he formed a new partnership with Charles Shearn, later the chief justice of Harris County. The store produced and sold Houston's first ice cream. The new firm sold candy and dry goods, while buying and selling wholesale with people from the Texas hinterlands. House started offering factoring service around this time, exchanging store goods in exchange for cotton. The store took orders for staples, such as flour and sugar, but also iron castings and percussion caps. House imported goods from Boston, New Orleans, and New York, but made direct cotton shipments to Liverpool, England.McComb (1981), pp. 1920. Transportation In 1850, House was one of the founders of the Houston Plank Road Company, an early attempt to improve wagon transportation to and from the interior. The company raised $150,000 in capital, but it scuttled plans for building oaken-plank roads as the feasibility of railroads emerged. In 1851, House helped to organize the steamboat company Houston and Galveston Navigation Company. Their steamboats carried not only freight, but also passengers and U.S. mail. Other companies he worked with included the Texas Transportation Company, the Houston Direct Navigation Company, and the Buffalo Bayou Ship Channel Company. All of these companies contributed to Houston's development. Mid-life and Civil War era For a brief time, he had a second partnership with his father-in-law Shearn. Later, in 1853, House bought the cotton jobbing business of James H. Stevens and Company, a dealer in dry goods and groceries. He paid $40,000 for it. At the time, it was the largest sum of money to change hands in Houston's history. House renamed the company T.W. House and Company, and began extending loans to cotton planters. Edward Mather, an employee since 1841, was his \\"company\\". However, when Mather left in 1862, House was alone in business again. During the time they were together, T.W. House and Company became Texas's largest wholesaler. House prospered selling commodities ranging from hides to syrup and from guns to blacksmithing tools. Ox wagons would wait 12 hours for their goods to be loaded into his store. Out of his store, he built his great private bank. An ardent supporter of the Confederacy, House supplied the army of Confederacy. When the Houston Light Guard marched off to battle in Virginia, it was nicknamed the Kid Glove Gentry because of the kid gloves House had outfitted each soldier with. His cotton wagons would go to the Mexican border and back, returning with loads of vital supplies. General John B. Magruder was one of many Confederates to recognize the value of House and his business. From his home in Galveston, House would survey the blockading Union fleet on stormy nights. The next morning, he surveyed them again. If one ship was gone, they were usually chasing his blockade runners. The ships would head off to Havana with a load of cotton, and then on to London, where they would return with arms for the Confederacy. During the war, in 1862, House served one term as the Mayor of Houston. Later years House did not stop developing Houston after the Civil War. In 1866, he organized the Houston Gas Company, Houston's first public utility. House erected the plant and the mains at a time when the general public was indifferent. Gas first came to hotels and public places. Slowly, it came to private homes, and eventually gas street lamps were erected on the streets of Houston. He also helped organize the first street railway, the Board of Trade and Cotton Exchange, the Houston and Texas Central Railroad, along with many other railroads. In 1870, his wife of thirty years died. In 1872, House purchased an extensive sugar plantation in Arcola. He also grew cotton. In La Salle County, he had a ranch. However, his health was failing. After seeking medical attention, House died on January 17, 1880, in San Antonio. His estate was valued at over $500,000, which made him the third richest man in Texas. His will directed that his estate be held together for five years. His mercantile and banking business was also to be operated in his name. One of his sons, Edward M. House, became an adviser to Woodrow Wilson. ReferencesExternal links * A Guide to the Thomas William House Papers, 1838-1872.

As part of the Emerald Necklace park system mainly designed by Frederick Law Olmsted in the late 19th century, Park Drive, along with the Back Bay Fens and the Fenway, connects the Commonwealth Avenue Mall and Boylston Street to Beacon Street and the Riverway. For a portion of its length, the parkway runs along the Muddy River and is part of the Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston's Muddy River Reservation. Like others in the park system, it is maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. Route description Park Drive begins near the intersection of Boylston Street and Ipswich Street and heads south with two one-way lanes to Peterborough Street. From there an additional one-way road begins with parallel parking on both sides. It runs on the north side of the flowing traffic and is separated by a grassy tree-lined median. The road continues in this fashion until it reaches the end of the Fens where the parking side merges into the main roadway along with traffic entering from the Fenway on the other side of the Muddy River. A parking lane is created on the right and the road travels with two one-way lanes towards Brookline Avenue. Two more lanes are added as it crosses Brookline Avenue and passes the Landmark Center in Audubon Circle. The two left lanes become left- turn-only and facilitate access to the Riverway and the reverse direction towards the Fenway. The right two lanes continue straight through the intersection and two lanes in the opposite direction join it. After its intersection with Beacon Street, Park Drive loses a lane in each direction and continues for two more blocks as part of Massachusetts Route 2 before ending at Mountfort Street near the Massachusetts Turnpike. Park Drive runs alongside the Muddy River from its beginning at Boylston Street to its intersection with Brookline Avenue. The Fenway, which is located on the other side of the Back Bay Fens, allows for continuous travel in the opposite direction of Park Drive. It is accessible from where Park Drive becomes two-way at Brookline Avenue and ends on Boylston Street near where Park Drive begins. History Park Drive with median separating main road (left) and service road (right). Easternmost end of Park Drive near Boylston Street. In 1875, the voters of the City of Boston and the Massachusetts legislature approved the creation of a park commission in order to promote the creation of public parks in the city. Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscape architect of New York City's Central Park, began to spend an increasing amount of time in the area and was asked by the park commission in the mid-to-late 1870s to be the judge of a 23-entry design competition to build a new park. Olmsted felt that all of the submitted plans were subpar and either did not take into account flood control or focused too much on it and neglected the public park aspect. The Muddy River and Stony Brook flowed through the Back Bay Fens (an artificial marshland commonly referred to as the Fens) which were at the time subject to tidal flow, storm flooding, and sewage discharge. The disappointed park commission then asked Olmsted to be its professional adviser and main landscape architect. Under his direction, what is now called the Emerald Necklace took shape. He directed the Fens to be dredged, graded, planted, and turned into a seemingly natural salt marsh to absorb and clean the flowing waters. He then built a series of parks stretching from the Fens near the existing Commonwealth Avenue greenway to Franklin Park some miles away. The parks were connected to each other by scenic parkways, one of which is Park Drive around the northern and western sides of the Back Bay Fens. Originally Park Drive was named Audubon Road in conjunction with the adjoining Audubon Circle, at the intersection with Beacon Street, in honor of the Audubon Society and the vast avian population within the Olmsted designed Fens. Nearby Hemenway Street was also named after Harriet Hemenway one of the founders of the Massachusetts Audubon Society The parkway was renamed Park Drive sometime between 1928 and 1938 when alterations to the Fens resulted in a large part of the artificial marshland being filled for more formal parkland . As part of the Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston, Park Drive is maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), rather than the City of Boston. The roadway from Boylston Street to Brookline Avenue opened to traffic on January 3, 1892, while surfacing of the remainder of the parkway to Mountfort Street was finished by 1895. Mountfort Street runs adjacent to the Boston and Albany Railroad right of way that the reference refers to. Major intersections The entire route is in the Fenway‚ÄìKenmore neighborhood of Boston, Suffolk County.

Although podium showings in 2001 and 2002 in the Strongest Man in Flanders contests showed Jimmy's potential as a strongman, he concentrated on powerlifting until 2005. From that point forward he began to compete in the Benelux strongman circuit consistently being in the top four in almost every contest he entered, winning 3 of the 8 contests he entered in 2005, predominantly in the Netherlands, with similar success in 2006. His competitive nature led to his nickname in Belgium and Holland becoming 'the Belgian Beast'. By 2008 he had become Belgian's Strongest Man and he repeated this feat in 2009. 2008 also saw his career graduate to the full international status, with an invitation to compete in the Strongman Champions League. He impressed enough to be invited back in 2009 where he was more consistent, and his improvement was such that he achieved a third-place finish in the Spanish leg of the League in October behind Ervin Katona and eventual League Champion Andrus Murumets. In 2009, in what was described as the strongest field for many years, Laureys was invited to the World's Strongest Man, being the first Belgian to have the honour. He was drawn in the same group as two previous title holders, Phil Pfister and five times winner Mariusz Pudzianowski. They finished in the top two spots and Laureys failed to qualify for the final. In 2010 he once again was the strongest man of Belgium. Jimmy has been dominating the Belgian competition since the first Belgium's Strongest Man, and is expected to continue doing so for the next couple of years.

They are fully identified, both by their geological origin as by the components of the relief, the constituent rocks and the geological structure. The Venezuelan Andean system represents the terminal bifurcation of the Cordillera Oriental de Colombia, which in Venezuelan territory consists of two mountainous branches: the Sierra de Perij√°, smaller, slightly displaced from southwest to northeast with 7,500 km2 in Venezuela; and a larger, frankly oriented Southwest to northeast with about 40,000 km2, the Cordillera de M√©rida, commonly known as the proper Venezuelan Andes. The highest point in Venezuela is located in this natural region.P√©rez et al (Sep. 2005): \\"Alturas del Pico Bol√≠var y otras cimas andinas venezolanas a partir de observaciones Gps.\\" INCI v.30, n.4, Caracas sep. 2005. Retrieved 2012-09-27. It covers around 5.2% of the national territory, being the 4th largest natural region in Venezuela. Geography Venezuelan Andes can be divided in two sections: * Cordillera de M√©rida: covering almost all the territory of T√°chira, M√©rida and Trujillo states, the southern area of Lara, and portions of higher areas on the western side of Barinas, Apure and Portuguesa states. It can be divided in three subregions: # Western Venezuelan Andes (Macizo del Tama, P√°ramos Batall√≥n y La Negra). # Central Venezuelan Andes (Macizo del Sur, Sierra Nevada de M√©rida, Sierra de La Culata, Sierra de Santo Domingo). # North-Eastern Venezuelan Andes (Sierra de Trujillo, Sierra de Portuguesa, Lara Andes) * Sierra de Perija: located at the western extreme of Venezuela in Zulia state, bordering Colombia. Geology They have a common geological origin, which dates back to the Eocene period of the early Tertiary era, about 40-50 million years ago, coincides with the beginning of the contact of the three tectonic plates (Nazca, Caribbean and South American) that began their orographic rise. Before the rise of the current Venezuelan Andes, between the Cambrian and Silurian periods, the so-called primitive Andes emerged, which already for the Triassic period (Mesozoic Era) had been almost completely flattened because of the intense erosive process to which were subjected. Quaternary tectonics It's characterized by the interaction of the three most important lithosperic plates in the region: Nazca, Caribbean and South American. A northwest-southwest oriented direction of compression produces vertical and horizontal deformation components, with the formation of thrusts align the Andean borders, and strike-slip faults. The split of Venezuelan Andes apparently began in the Late Eocene, and its present height was probably attained before the Quaternary. During the Quaternary. the main active structures are the strike-slip faults. the principal one being the Bocon√≥ Fault Zone, with a measured dextral displacement of several millimeters per year. In the field this displacement is shown by the existence of fault trenches, fault depressions, sag ponds, offset ridges and lateral moraines. Glacial geology Like all tropical mountain ranges with altitudes above 3,000 m, the Venezuelan Andes were affected by Pleistocene glaciations. =Late Pleistocene Glaciation= Two morainic complexes have been recognized in the Cordillera de M√©rida: one between 2,600 and 2,800 m altitude, and another one between 2,900 and 3,500 m. These two levels have been considered as Early and Late Stades, respectively, of the M√©rida Glaciation. The moraines of the Late Stade are topographically well represented, and several superposed moraines, or morainic complexes, are found. The glaciated area in Cordillera de M√©rida during the Last Glacial Maximum was approximately 600 km2 In the Sierra de Perija, the existence of moraines has been mentioned at altitudes between 2,700 and 3,100 m. In the absecence of more detailed data, these have been tentatively assigned to the Late Stade of the M√©rida Glaciation. =Late Holocene Glaciation= Evidence of Late Holocene morainic sedimentation are based on palynological and radiocarbon analyses, which established a cold phase between the 15th and middle-19th centuries, which can be correlate with the Little Ice Age. The moraines associated with this phase are most probably those located at an altitude of approximately 4,700 m between 100 and 200 below the terminal zone of present-day glaciers.

The player controls Terry, a green bouncing sphere, on a quest to recover his magic crystals that have been stolen by Baron von Bonsai. To do so, he must travel through the eponymous Cloud Kingdoms, avoiding enemies and hazards while collecting all of the crystals within the game's time limit. The game was developed by Dene Carter at Logotron, with sounds and music composed by David Whittaker. Most editions were priced at ¬£24.99 upon their release, except for the Commodore 64 ports, which were less expensive. Reception for the Amiga version was generally positive, but was more mixed for the Commodore 64 port. Most reviews, however, praised the graphics and gameplay and criticized the difficulty and the amount of content that was available for the price. A less expensive re-release for Amiga computers a year later, at ¬£7.99, also received mixed reviews. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot from the Commodore 64 version of Cloud Kingdoms Cloud Kingdoms is an arcade puzzle game where the player controls the character of Terry, a green bouncing sphere with eyes, in his quest to recover his magic crystals that were stolen by the game's antagonist, Baron von Bonsai. The crystals have been scattered across a series of levels, the eponymous Cloud Kingdoms, which Terry must conquer in order to win the game. The player navigates Terry through each Kingdom from a top-down perspective and can move in eight directions, as well as jump over enemies, obstacles, and holes. Enemies include fairies that have been transformed into insects and by Baron von Bonsai. There are 15 Kingdoms in the Commodore 64 version and 32 in all others. Players begin the game with a preset choice of four Kingdoms to begin with, with each leading to four other kingdoms that are opened up once the level is won. The objective in each Kingdom is to collect all of the crystals and maneuver through hazards such as trap doors, slippery floors, magnet floors that prevent Terry from jumping, and pinball bumpers. The game overall has a time limit of 99 \\"Manukas\\", each of which is equivalent to approximately four seconds. Contact with lava fields or enemies drains the player's energy and, if all energy is lost, the level is reset and ten Manukas are subtracted from the remaining total. The level can also be restarted voluntarily, at the cost of five Manukas. When the Manuka counter reaches zero, the game ends. Collecting clocks will add five Manukas to the timer, while successfully completing a Kingdom will add twenty. Energy can be restored by collecting soda bottles, while shields will make Terry invincible to enemies for a short period. Other items include wings, which allow Terry to fly over all obstacles, paint cans, which allow him to fill in holes and trap doors, and alcohol bottles that temporarily make the gameplay more difficult by altering some of the mechanics. Development and release Cloud Kingdoms was developed at Logotron by Dene Carter, who had previously worked on Druid and its sequel Enlightenment for the Commodore 64, as well as Dragon Lord. It was published under Logotron's publishing arm Millennium Interactive Ltd. The game contains a small assortment of sound effects, as well as music on the title screen, and tunes that play when particular items are collected, all composed by David Whittaker. Upon its release in 1990, Cloud Kingdoms was priced at ¬£24.99 for the Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS versions, and ¬£9.99 and ¬£14.99 for a Commodore 64 cassette and disk respectively. In addition to having fewer levels, the Commodore 64 version also omitted several styles of the enemies. The MS-DOS edition came out a week after the others and supported EGA and VGA graphics. It also featured fewer sounds than the other versions. Reception and legacy Reviews for Cloud Kingdom on Amiga computers were positive. Writing for Computer and Video Games, Paul Rand praised the graphics and gameplay over similar games such as Quedex, and enjoyed its \\"stimulating and addictive\\" challenge, rating it at 80%, while Australian Commodore and Amiga Review offered a higher estimation of 83%, with praise overall for the game. ACE magazine gave the Amiga version a score of 730 out of 1000, claiming that it was \\"taxing enough to provide a good few hours of solid entertainment\\", while Amiga Action gave it a similar overall score of 72%. Carsten Borgmeier of the German publication Amiga Joker gave the game 71%, docking points primarily for the game's high level of difficulty, while Kati Hamza's 78% for The One was based on concerns that the price might be too high for the amount of content offered. Mark Caswell of The Games Machine held Cloud Kingdoms in high esteem, praising the sound, graphics, and gameplay with an overall 86% rating. Conversely, finding the game average all-around, Magnus Friskytt of the Swedish Datormagazin scored it 5 out of 10. Similarly mixed reviews were produced for the Commodore 64 version. On the high end, The Games Machine's Mark Caswell again lauded the game, scoring it at 89% and commenting that it was even more playable than the Amiga edition. Stewart C. Russell, writing for Amiga Computing, held the game in lower esteem with a 78% rating, subtracting points for the graphics in particular. Zzap!64 gave the port a rating of 80%, calling it \\"a well presented and addictive arcade-puzzle game\\" and feeling that the gameplay was somewhat easier than the Amiga version, which it gave a lower score of 72% for its difficulty and price. Paul Rand of Computer and Video Games also scored the Commodore 64 version at 80%, claiming that it was just as good as the Amiga version despite the reduced number of levels. He gave the same rating to the Atari ST version, noting that the only differences were \\"cosmetic\\", an assessment that Katai Hamza agreed with for his Atari ST review in The One. Hamza also looked at the MS-DOS version and claimed that the reduced graphics and sound \\"in no way serve[] to detriment the proceedings\\". Datormagazins Pontus Linberg, on the other hand, gave the Commodore 64 version 5 out of 10, the same as the magazine would give the Amiga version in its following issue. Anatol Locker of the German Power Play magazine felt that the Atari ST version was too easy and, despite its impressive graphics, borrowed too heavily from games such as Quedex, Puffy's Saga, and Rock 'n' Roll. His final verdict was 43%. Cloud Kingdoms was re- released for Amiga computers in mid-1991 by GBH at the budget price of ¬£7.99. The One for Amiga Games, which had rated the game 78% upon its initial release, lowered its score for the re-release to 3 out of 5, but still admitted that it was \\"eminently playable and will keep you amused long enough to easily justify the price tag\\". The Amiga Format review was more negative, giving the game 56% after praising its aesthetic appeal but noting that its \\"strangely remote joystick response [...] makes a tough design harder to play than it really should be\\".

Johannes \\"Jan\\" Heyns (14?? in Brugge - 1516 in 's-Hertogenbosch) was a Flemish-Brabantic architect. Originally from Brugge, Jan Heyns was active in 's-Hertogenbosch from 1495. There he became the architect in charge of building the St. John's Cathedral. The construction of the cathedral was then in full force. Under Jan Heyns' direction the chapel of the Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady, a society from 's-Hertogenbosch that was dedicated to the veneration of Saint Mary, was completed in 1496, and in 1505 the entire preceding Roman church of St. John, excluding the tower, was demolished to make room for the nave of the new cathedral. As a reward for his service, Heyns was admitted to the Illustrious Brotherhood as a sworn-in brother. Only persons from the highest levels of society or persons that distinguished themselves were allowed to be sworn into the brotherhood. Heyns' membership of the brotherhood meant that he belonged to the laity - though in the lowest rank - and he was thereby required to organize meals at his home for his fellow brothers. He also carried out other services for the Brotherhood; In this capacity he, along with fellow Brother Jeroen Bosch, advised the sculptor on the size of the altarpiece for the Brotherhood that the sculptor was to make in 1508-1509. Jan Heyns did not live to see the completion of the Sint-Jan, as he died during a pleurisy epidemic that struck 's-Hertogenbosch from 1515 to 1516. He was.

Background Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Nemec spent most of his adolescence in Bay Village, Ohio. In his senior year of high school he was named the first winner of the prestigious Ed Bang scholarship, created to honor the \\"Dean of American Sports Writers.\\" Nemec subsequently played outfield and first base for Ohio State University while earning a BA in English (graduating in 1960). After serving in the army, he taught and coached in Cleveland public schools while working on a novel about the Sam Sheppard murder case, which occurred in his hometown of Bay Village. Sheppard had been Nemec's family physician prior to his 1954 conviction for his wife's slaying, which was later overturned. Nemec moved to New York City with his first wife, the visual artist Vernita Nemec (aka Vernita N‚ÄôCognita) in 1965. In 1967 he won a Transatlantic Review award for his first published story, \\"On the Produce Dock\\". Early days Throughout the 1970s Nemec worked as a parole officer in the Youthful Offender Bureau with the New York State Division of Parole while he continued to publish stories, two of which gained citations in The Best American Short Stories. The parole experience later provided the backdrop for Nemec's second novel, Mad Blood, based loosely on the 1963 Wylie- Hoffert murder case. In August 1973, Nemec was awarded the first of several residencies he was to spend at Yaddo, the artists‚Äô and writers‚Äô colony in Saratoga Springs, New York. Following his second Yaddo stay in 1975, Nemec drew on his vast knowledge of baseball history to create The Absolutely Most Challenging Baseball Quiz Book, Ever (Macmillan, 1977), it launched a series of popular Nemec baseball quiz books. Toward the end of the 1970s, Nemec returned to fiction, publishing his first novel, Bright Lights, Dark Rooms. He has since published seven more novels. 1980s to Present During the 1990s, Nemec expanded on the research he had done for his historical baseball novel, Early Dreams, to become a scholar on baseball's infancy as a professional sport. Since 1987, Nemec has authored or co-authored over 20 books on baseball, many focusing on the game's embryonic years. In 1994, Lyons & Burford published The Rules of Baseball, Nemec's anecdotal look at the evolution of the rules of the game. The following year the same publisher brought out his The Beer and Whisky League, a history of the American Association during its ten-year existence (1882‚Äì1891) as a rebel major league. In 1997, Donald I. Fine Books published Nemec's The Great Encyclopedia of Nineteenth Century Major League Baseball. The book was updated and expanded and reissued in 2006 by the University of Alabama. Nemec has received The Sporting News Research Award, the McFarland Baseball Research Award, playwriting grants from The Impossible Ragtime Theater and the Huntington Playhouse, fellowships in creative writing and numerous residency fellowships at the Corporation of Yaddo, the MacDowell Colony, the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts and the Edward Albee Foundation. He has taught writing at the College of Marin, St. Mark's Church in the Bowery and prisons in the San Francisco Bay Area. Nemec is a member of SABR, [the Society for American Baseball Research] and a recipient of a lifetime Henry Chadwick Award, which was established in 2009 to honor baseball's greatest researchers. Among his most recent baseball books are, Major League Baseball Profiles: 1871-1900, vols. 1 & 2; \\"The Rank and File of 19th Century Major League Baseball, a trilogy of biographies of every 19th century player, major owner, manager, league official and regular umpire; and \\"Forfeits and Successfully Protested Major League Games: A Complete Record 1871-2013\\".

According to the Book of Han, the school was one of the Nine Schools of Thought (). Background According to the Han Feizi, a contemporary work on Legalist Philosophy, supporters of \\"Vertical Alliance\\" encourage the weak multitude to attack the one strong side whilst the Horizontal Alliance promote the one strong side attacking the weak multitude. They are all fickle and capricious, change sides frequently and are unable to decide who their master is. Both Su Qin of the Vertical Alliance clique and Zhang Yi of the Horizontal Alliance clique issue many plans and schemes that are politically subjective.' The origins of the terms \\"Vertical\\" and \\"Horizontal\\" are geographic and are based on either a North-South axis (i.e. vertical) or an East-West axis (i.e. horizontal). Thus the six states allied on the North-South axis were known as the \\"Vertical Alliance\\" whilst those on the East-West axis aligned with the State of Qin were termed the \\"Horizontal Alliance\\". \\"Zong\\" indicates the \\"He Zong\\", or Vertical Alliance, the \\"weak multitude against the one strong side\\", made up of the six states of Qi, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao and Wei united against Qin. \\"Heng\\" indicates the \\"Lian Heng\\", or Horizontal Alliance, the \\"one strong side to smash the weak multitude\\", thus illustrating the different diplomatic policies of the two sides. The School of Diplomacy was one of the nine styles of the ten Schools of Thought of the Warring States period and starts with an objective point of view to reach the required goal. The school‚Äôs adherents were always an active group on the political stage during the Warring States period. Moreover, they played a decisive role and were described as extremely powerful and capable, constantly struggling to manipulate the situation. Originated by Guiguzi, the School of Diplomacy‚Äôs main adherents were Su Qin, Zhang Yi (Su‚Äôs disciple), Gan Mao, Sima Cuo, Yue Yi, Fan Sui, Cai Ze, Zou Ji, Mao Sui, Li Yiji and Kuai Tong as detailed in the Annals of the Warring States. The few principal written records of the School of Diplomacy that exist today are the thirteenth chapter of the Book of Gui or Guiguzi, the thirty-third chapter of Annals of the Warring States (not about the School of Diplomacy‚Äôs followers but primarily the words and actions of its advisors as well as actual combat case studies), the thirty-first chapter of Su Zi and the tenth chapter of Zhang Zi. The seventh chapter of the \\"Benjing Yifu\\" appendix to the Guiguzi describes the mental and moral cultivation methods used by the School of Diplomacy; the \\"Benjing\\" covers the ideas behind the basic guiding principles whilst the \\"Yinfu\\" consists of very mysterious concealed writings. The reader can comprehend these but is unable to discover their essential meaning. The Guiguzi is a book of theory that is complete in every detail and very subtly written, making its ideas hard to express. More importantly the work requires study and use in order to understand the nuances of its meaning. The Annals of the Warring States is a well-written rhetorical compendium the words and actions of the strategists of the School of Diplomacy who were all resourceful, intelligent, aware of the actual situation and gifted in the use of language.

She is best known as the wife of Malcolm Lowry and for her support of the author while he wrote his best known novel, Under the Volcano, considered one of the finest novels of the 20th century. Biography=Acting career The younger sister of silent screen star Priscilla Bonner, she also appeared in several films (spelling her first name Marjorie), among them Cecil B. DeMille's The King of Kings (1927), The Sign of the Cross (1932), and the talkie Cleopatra (1934). By the late 1930s her movie career was over and she was working as a personal assistant to the actress Penny Singleton. Relationship with Malcolm Lowry and writing career On June 7, 1939, she met British author Malcolm Lowry on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue at the time he had had begun the second draft of Under the Volcano. They married in 1940 and settled in a beach shack in Dollarton, a small town near Vancouver, British Columbia. Bonner wrote scripts for CBC Radio and worked with Lowry on a screenplay for the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel Tender Is the Night. She wrote three novels during the 1940s. Two were mystery novels, The Shapes That Creep (1944) and The Last Twist of the Knife (1946) (both \\"in the vein of Agatha Christie\\"); a third was \\"a more ambitious novel about human passions, dreams, and failure\\", Horse in the Sky (1947). A fourth novel, The Castle of Malatesta, was a psychological novel that remained in manuscript. She is chiefly remembered for her unsung role in the creation of Lowry's masterpiece, Under the Volcano (1947). Not only did she provide the supportive environment her husband needed in order to write, she meticulously edited the novel's manuscript while various passages were rewritten at her suggestion.National Film Board of Canada (NFB) interview - 1976 film on Lowry's life Since Lowry had a tendency toward verbosity, her most frequent editorial comment was \\"cut\\". She is widely ‚Äúconsidered to be the model for its central female character, the consul's wife, Yvonne.\\" After Lowry's death in 1957, Margerie Bonner returned to Los Angeles and co-edited with Douglas Day the unfinished novel Dark as the Grave Wherein My Friend Is Laid in 1968, and edited his Psalms and Songs in 1975. =Lowry's death= In 1955 Lowry was persuaded by her to return to Ripe, a small village in Sussex, England, where he died two years later \\"after a fatal mixture of gin and sodium amytol: the coroner's verdict was 'Death by misadventure.'\\"Bradbrook (1974), 19. \\"Foul play at White Cottage\\", an article by biographer Gordon Bowker published in the Times Literary Supplement on 20 February 2004, outlined inconsistencies in the various different accounts of Lowry's death offered by Margerie.Bowker(2004) A 2007 collection of texts by Lowry suggests \\"he either committed suicide or was in fact murdered by his wife.\\"The Voyage that Never Ends: Malcolm Lowry in His Own Words, ed.

It is the name given by the tourism industry to Praia de Augas Santas (translated from Galician: 'Beach of the Holy Waters'). The beach is located in the Ribadeo municipality, in the province of Lugo (Galicia), on the Cantabric coast, and it lies about ten kilometres to the west of the town of Ribadeo. Its name is derived from it's cliff formations. It has been declared a Natural Monument by the regional Ministry for the Environment of the Xunta de Galicia. Overview The characteristic features of the beach are its natural arches and caves, which can be seen only at low tide. During high tide, the beach appears small, but still suitable for swimming. During low tide the size of its cliffs and sea caves is more apparent, ranging from small cracks on the rock to big caves whose roofs have collapsed due to the erosion of the waves. At low tide, there is access to a sand deposit delimited by a rocky wall made from slate and schist forming 30 meters arches resembling cathedral flying buttresses, large caves, sand corridors between rocky blocks, and other geological features. Particularly low tides create access to nearby beaches through the sand extension. As the coast stretch is almost horizontal, the water covers the beach again very quickly.

Academics argue over the actual impact of the bill, but general consensus is that it made the idea that the House of Commons should be consulted on all matters of general interest. The Statute is seen as \\"the end of a period of revolutionary experiments in English government\\", with no Ordinances ever attempted again. Background The Ordinances of 1311 were provisions imposed upon King Edward II by the peerage and clergy of the Kingdom of England to restrict the power of the king. Edward's victory against his political opposition at the Battle of Boroughbridge on 16 March 1322, and the execution of the Earl of Lancaster 6 days later, gave him a large amount of freedom, and Parliament was summoned to meet at York on 2 May 1322 with a writ backdated to 2 days before Boroughbridge. Edward's first matter was \\"the statute on the repeal of the ordinances\\",Lapsey (January 1941) p.22 though with the proviso of \\"putting of the good points of the Ordinances into a statute\\".Royal memo, quoted in J. R. Tanner ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol vii (Cambridge 1932) p. 425 Draft copies discovered in the Public Record Office indicate that the Statute was originally only meant to repeal the Ordinances of 1311, with no additional provisions.Haskins (1937) p.76 The second draft, however, completely vindicated the idea of the royal prerogative, and prevented any similar Ordinances from being enacted, saying that \\"the Matters which are to be established for the Estate of our Lord the King and of his Heirs and for the Estate of the Realm and the People shall be treated accorded and established in Parliaments ... according as it hath been heretofore accustomed\\".Haskins (1937) p.77 As a result of the Statute, the Ordinances were repealed, and no attempt was ever made to reintroduce them; this has been seen as \\"the end of a period of revolutionary experiments in English government\\".Strayer (1941) p.1 Constitutional implications The House of Lords committee that discussed the Statute concluded that it meant to formalise what had previously been custom in regards to the rights of peers and the monarch, and that any previous statute made without regard for this was void.Lapsey (1913) p.118 Henry Hallam concluded that, although seeming to advance the rights of the people by confirming previous custom (which included requiring the Monarch to consult the House of Commons when passing a Statute), the enactment \\"seems rather to limit than to enhance the supreme power of parliament, if it were meant to prohibit any future enactment of the kind by its sole authority\\", since the Lords Ordainers had been elected by the people; nonetheless, most historians believe it extended the Commons' rights.Lapsey (1913) p.119 Those historians who do agree that it recognised the right of the Commons do not agree what it recognised; some say that it required the consent of the Commons when significant constitutional changes were to be made,Strayer (1941) p.2 some that it merely recognised the right of the Commons to be consulted in financial matters,Strayer (1941) p.3 and some that it recognised the right of the Commons to be consulted on all matters of general interest; the third theory is the most commonly accepted one. As stated, \\"the matters to be established for the estate of the king and of his heirs, and for the estate of the realm and of the people, should be treated, accorded, and established in parliament, by the king, and by the assent of the prelates, earls, and barons, and the commonalty of the realm, according as had been before accustomed\\"Strayer (1941) p.4 Further remedies While the Ordinances themselves had been repealed, many of the administrative points they had contained - regarding in particular sheriffs, the Statute of Merchants, and two grievances over legal appeals (Ordinances 17, 33, 35 and 36) - were taken over almost word for word in the new legislation,J.

S., and J. Denavit. Kinematic Synthesis of Linkages. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1964. on-line through KMODDL. It was introduced by Ludwig Burmester (1840‚Äì1927). His approach was to compute the geometric constraints of the linkage directly from the inventor's desired movement for a floating link. From this point of view a four-bar linkage is a floating link that has two points constrained to lie on two circles. Burmester began with a set of locations, often called poses, for the floating link, which are viewed as snapshots of the constrained movement of this floating link in the device that is to be designed. The design of a crank for the linkage now becomes finding a point in the moving floating link that when viewed in each of these specified positions has a trajectory that lies on a circle. The dimension of the crank is the distance from the point in the floating link, called the circling point, to the center of the circle it travels on, called the center point.Burmester, L. Lehrbuch der Kinematik. Leipzig: Verlag von Arthur Felix, 1886. Two cranks designed in this way form the desired four-bar linkage. This formulation of the mathematical synthesis of a four-bar linkage and the solution to the resulting equations is known as Burmester Theory.Suh, C. H., and Radcliffe, C. W. Kinematics and Mechanism Design. New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1978.Sandor, G. N., and Erdman, A. G. Advanced Mechanism Design: Analysis and Synthesis. Vol. 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1984.Hunt, K. H. Kinematic Geometry of Mechanisms. Oxford Engineering Science Series, 1979. The approach has been generalized to the synthesis of spherical and spatial mechanisms. J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh. Geometric Design of Linkages. 2nd Edition, Springer, 2010.  Finite position synthesis =Geometric formulation Burmester theory seeks points in a moving body that have trajectories that lie on a circle called circling points. The designer approximates the desired movement with a finite number of task positions; and Burmester showed that circling points exist for as many as five task positions. Finding these circling points requires solving five quadratic equations in five unknowns, which he did using techniques in descriptive geometry. Burmester's graphical constructions still appear in machine theory textbooks to this day. P is the pole of the displacement of A1B1 to A2B2 Two positions: As an example consider a task defined by two positions of the coupler link, as shown in the figure. Choose two points A and B in the body, so its two positions define the segments A1B1 and A2B2. It is easy to see that A is a circling point with a center that is on the perpendicular bisector of the segment A1A2. Similarly, B is a circling point with a center that is any point on the perpendicular bisector of B1B2. A four- bar linkage can be constructed from any point on the two perpendicular bisectors as the fixed pivots and A and B as the moving pivots. The point P is clearly special, because it is a hinge that allows pure rotational movement of A1B1 to A2B2. It is called the relative displacement pole. Three positions: If the designer specifies three task positions, then points A and B in the moving body are circling points each with a unique center point. The center point for A is the center of the circle that passes through A1, A2 and A3 in the three positions. Similarly, the center point for B is the center of the circle that passes through B1, B2 and B3. Thus for three task positions, a four-bar linkage is obtained for every pair of points A and B chosen as moving pivots. Four positions: Graphical solution to the synthesis problem becomes more interesting in the case of four task positions, because not every point in the body is a circling point. Four task positions yield six relative displacement poles, and Burmester selected four to form the opposite pole quadrilateral, which he then used to graphically generate the circling point curve (Kreispunktcurven). Burmester also showed that the circling point curve was a circular cubic curve in the moving body. Five positions: To reach five task positions, Burmester intersects the circling point curve generated by the opposite pole quadrilateral for a set of four of the five task positions, with the circling point curve generated by the opposite pole quadrilateral for different set of four task positions. Five poses imply ten relative displacement poles, which yields four different opposite pole quadrilaterals each having its own circling point curve. Burmester shows that these curves will intersect in as many as four points, called the Burmester points, each of which will trace five points on a circle around a center point. Because two circling points define a four-bar linkage, these four points can yield as many as six four-bar linkages that guide the coupler link through the five specified task positions. Algebraic formulation Burmester's approach to the synthesis of a four-bar linkage can be formulated mathematically by introducing coordinate transformations [Ti] = [Ai, di], i = 1, ..., 5, where [A] is a 2√ó2 rotation matrix and d is a 2√ó1 translation vector, that define task positions of a moving frame M specified by the designer. The goal of the synthesis procedure is to compute the coordinates w = (wx, wy) of a moving pivot attached to the moving frame M and the coordinates of a fixed pivot G = (u, v) in the fixed frame F that have the property that w travels on a circle of radius R about G. The trajectory of w is defined by the five task positions, such that :\\\\mathbf{W}^i = [T_i]\\\\mathbf{w} = [A_i]\\\\mathbf{w}+\\\\mathbf{d}_i,\\\\quad i=1,\\\\ldots, 5. Thus, the coordinates w and G must satisfy the five equations, :(\\\\mathbf{W}^i -\\\\mathbf{G})\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{W}^i -\\\\mathbf{G})=R^2,\\\\quad i=1,\\\\ldots, 5. Eliminate the unknown radius R by subtracting the first equation from the rest to obtain the four quadratic equations in four unknowns, :(\\\\mathbf{W}^i -\\\\mathbf{G})\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{W}^i -\\\\mathbf{G}) - (\\\\mathbf{W}^1 -\\\\mathbf{G})\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{W}^1 -\\\\mathbf{G}) =0,\\\\quad i=2,\\\\ldots, 5. These synthesis equations can be solved numerically to obtain the coordinates w = (wx, wy) and G = (u, v) that locate the fixed and moving pivots of a crank that can be used as part of a four-bar linkage. Burmester proved that there are at most four of these cranks, which can be combined to yield at most six four-bar linkages that guide the coupler through the five specified task positions. It is useful to notice that the synthesis equations can be manipulated into the form, :(\\\\mathbf{W}^i -\\\\mathbf{W}^1) \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{W}^i +\\\\mathbf{W}^1}{2} - \\\\mathbf{G}\\\\right) =0,\\\\quad i=2,\\\\ldots, 5, which is the algebraic equivalent of the condition that the fixed pivot G lies on the perpendicular bisectors of each of the four segments Wi ‚àí W1, i = 2, ..., 5\\\\. Input-output synthesis One of the more common applications of a four-bar linkage appears as a rod that connects two levers, so that rotation of the first lever drives the rotation of the second lever. The levers are hinged to a ground frame and are called the input and output cranks, and the connecting rod is the called the coupler link. Burmester's approach to the design of a four-bar linkage can be used to locate the coupler so that five specified angles of the input crank result in five specified angles of the output crank. Let Œ∏i, i = 1, ..., 5 be the angular positions of the input crank, and let œài, i = 1, ..., 5 be the corresponding angles of the output crank. For convenience locate the fixed pivot of the input crank at the origin of the fixed frame, O = (0, 0), and let the fixed pivot of the output crank be located at C = (cx, cy), which is chosen by the designer. The unknowns in this synthesis problem are the coordinates g = (gx, gy) of the coupler attachment to the input crank and the coordinates w = (wx, wy) of the attachment to the output crank, measured in their respective reference frames. While the coordinates of w and g are not known their trajectories in the fixed frame are given by, : \\\\mathbf{G}^i=[A(\\\\theta_i)]\\\\mathbf{g},\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{W}^i=[A(\\\\psi_i)]\\\\mathbf{w} + \\\\mathbf{C},\\\\quad i=1, \\\\ldots, 5, where [A(‚Ä¢)] denotes the rotation by the given angle. The coordinates of w and g must satisfy the five constraint equations, :(\\\\mathbf{W}^i -\\\\mathbf{G}^i)\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{W}^i -\\\\mathbf{G}^i)=R^2,\\\\quad i=1,\\\\ldots, 5. Eliminate the unknown coupler length R by subtracting the first equation from the rest to obtain the four quadratic equations in four unknowns, :(\\\\mathbf{W}^i -\\\\mathbf{G}^i)\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{W}^i -\\\\mathbf{G}^i) - (\\\\mathbf{W}^1 -\\\\mathbf{G}^1)\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{W}^1 -\\\\mathbf{G}^1) =0,\\\\quad i=2,\\\\ldots, 5. These synthesis equations can be solved numerically to obtain the coordinates w = (wx, wy) and g = (gx, gy) that locate the coupler of the four-bar linkage. This formulation of the input-output synthesis of a four-bar linkage is an inversion of finite-position synthesis, where the movement of the output crank relative to the input crank is specified by the designer. From this viewpoint the ground link OC is a crank that satisfies the specified finite positions of the movement of the output crank relative to the input crank, and Burmester's results show that its existence guarantees the presence of at least one coupler link. Furthermore, Burmester's results show that there may be as many as three of these coupler links that provide the desired input-output relationship.  References  Further reading  * Ian R.

He is best remembered for his victory in the inaugural Monte Carlo Rally when he drove his Turcat- M√©ry from Paris to Monte Carlo, but he was also a regular competitor in both 'City to City' and Grand Prix races. On 18 November 1909 he was awarded Aviator's Certificate number 11 by the A√©ro-Club de France. Throughout 1909 and 1910 he was a very successful competitor at Air shows and Grands Prix throughout Europe. Rougier was a successful entrepreneur, owning the Paris agency for Turcat-M√©ry motor cars, and using his motor racing and rallying prowess to garner publicity. After World War I he manufactured a limited number of Rougier motor cars, based on Turcat-M√©ry chassis but with mechanical design improvements and exclusive coach-built bodies. Rougier was appointed Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur, plus being awarded the Croix de guerre and the 'Medal of Aeronautics'. Family life Rougier was born in Marseille, on 28 October 1876. Motoring=Motor racing 1903 Paris-Madrid race. Henri Rougier driving his Turcat-M√©ry 45-hp finished 11th overall, and 9th in the heavy car class Henri Rougier was the main dealer for Turcat-M√©ry motor vehicles, and like most other manufacturers he used racing and competition as both a technical development and publicity aid for marketing. In May 1903 Rougier finished 11th overall in the Paris-Madrid race driving a 45-hp Turcat- M√©ry. He was also classified 9th in the heavy car class. On 17 June 1904 Rougier competed in the Gordon Bennett Cup race in Germany driving a 45-hp Turcat-M√©ry. Kaiser Wilhelm II had decreed that the race start from Bad Homburg in the Taunus mountains. He finished in third place, taking 6 hours 46 minutes 31 seconds to complete the . In 1905 Rougier competed in the Circuit des Ardennes at Bastogne. His Lorraine-Dietrich set the fastest lap of 68.51 mph. In 1906 Rougier finished third in the Circuit des Ardennes at Bastogne, driving a Lorraine-Dietrich. His time was 5 hours 50 minutes 11 seconds. At the inaugural 1906 French Grand Prix he was unclassified, over 1 lap behind the winner. In 1907 Rougier competed in the French Grand Prix at Dieppe, driving a Lorraine-Dietrich but retired on lap 5. On 19 May 1908 Rougier competed in the Saint Petersburg-Moscow race driving a Lorraine-Dietrich but retired early. In the 1908 French Grand Prix at Dieppe, he retired on the first lap with magneto problems on his Lorraine-Dietrich. In 1923 Rougier competed in the French Grand Prix at Tours, driving a 'Voisin Laboratoire' he retired after 19 laps. In the 1923 Italian Grand Prix at Monza he retired after 28 laps. Monte Carlo rally In 1909 the Automobile Club de Monaco (Sport Automobile Velocipedique Mon√©gasque) started planning a car rally at the behest of Albert I, Prince of Monaco. The Monte Carlo Rally was to start at points all over Europe and converge on Monte Carlo. In January 1911 23 cars set out from 11 different locations and Rougier was among the nine who left Paris to cover a route. The event was won by Henri Rougier in a Turcat-M√©ry 25 Hp. The rally comprised both driving and then somewhat arbitrary judging based on the elegance of the car, passenger comfort and the condition in which it arrived in the principality. The outcry of scandal when the results were published changed nothing, so Rougier was proclaimed the first winner. Motor manufacture 1906 Turcat-M√©ry The Turcat-M√©ry motor manufacturing business began in 1895 when Alphonse M√©ry of Marseille bought a Panhard- Levassor and a Peugeot. His younger brother Simon M√©ry and his brother in law L√©on Turcat, both engineers, decided to improve on both models with their own design, a 2.6-litre, four cylinder, five speed car with electric ignition, radiators at each end of the engine and two speeds in reverse. Thus in 1899, when the car was ready for sale, they founded Turcat-M√©ry & Cie. They then established a partnership with Baron Adrien de Turckheim :fr:Adrien de Turckheim of the De Dietrich and Lorraine-Dietrich company, and produced cars whose slogan was The Car of the Connoisseur. Rougier became the Paris agent and chief publicist for both Turcat-M√©ry and Lorraine-Dietrich. The liaison with Lorraine-Dietrich lasted until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Turcat-M√©ry ceased production in 1928. After World War I Rougier purchased a limited number of completed 1913/14 Turcat-M√©ry chassis which he then had reworked to improve the engines and four-wheel brakes using Henri Perrot's latest drum/shoe brake design. The chassis were then bodied by coach-builders such as Million Guillet in Levallois-Perret Paris and the exclusive finished models were badged and registered as 'Rougier'. Aviation Anvers Aviation Meeting in 1909. Henri Rougier flying a Voisin biplane powered by a Gn√¥me Om√©ga engine In 1909, Rougier learned to fly in a Voisin powered by a Gnome Omega engine. On 18 November 1909 he was awarded Aviator's Certificate number 11 by the A√©ro-Club de France. In September 1909 he won the prizes for distance and altitude at the Grand Prix of Berlin, while fellow Frenchman Hubert Latham won the prize for speed. The Grand Prix was the first aviation tournament held in Germany, having been triggered by the public enthusiasm for Orville Wright's demonstration flights at Templehoff and Potsdam in August 1909. At the 1909 Air Show in Brescia, Italy in September Rougier again won the altitude prize, beating Glen Curtiss in the Curtiss No. 2. He also competed in the 1909 Air meetings at Frankfurt, Germany and Blackpool, England where he finished in second place. Then in Antwerp (Anvers) he won all the races. At the Air Show in Heliopolis in Egypt, he won first prize for 'aggregate distance' and second prize for 'longest distance without stopping'. In January 1910 in Monaco he became renowned for his exploits over both the Mediterranean Sea and Mount Agel. He described one particularly dangerous trip from Monaco to Nice in high, changeable winds: In 1910 he is reported to have competed in California with the Voisin; this is presumed to be the California horse racing course outside Nice. Endurance flying In an age when endurance flights were a considerable achievement and of sufficient risk to be publicly noteworthy, Rougier's performances were included in the tables of Flight International magazine. * 12 Sept 1909: Voisin: Brescia: 1 hour 9 minutes * 28 Sept 1909: Voisin: Johannisthal Air Field: 1 hour 20 minutes * 29 Sept 1909: Voisin: Johannisthal Air Field: 1 hour 37 minutes * 28 Oct 1909: Voisin: Antwerp: 1 hour 3 minutes * 6 Feb 1910: Voisin: Heliopolis in Egypt: * 11 Feb 1910: Voisin: Heliopolis: Aircraft manufacture In 1910 Rougier became a partner of Antoine Odier and Raoul Vend√¥me in the Odier-Vend√¥me aeroplane company, building the Odier-Vend√¥me biplane. Rougier flew the aircraft at locations such as Issy-les-Moulineaux and Terni and Ghedi in Italy. Rougier may also have been involved in the independent construction of a 'Rougier' biplane, although there is only a single, hard to identify, photograph which may show a standard Voisin that was owned by Rougier.

It was active between 1926 and 1929. During its short-lived history, it was one of the most important political parties in Slovenia. The party was founded in May 1926 out of the fusion of the liberal agrarian Independent Agrarian Party and the left wing federalist Slovenian Labour Agrarian Republican Party. The new party adopted a federalist and progressivist program, and became one of the most vocal advocates of Slovenian autonomy within Yugoslavia. The Slovene Peasant Party allied itself with the Croatian Peasant Party, which largely served as its ideological model. However, the Slovene Peasant Party never gained the popularity of its Croatian counterpart. Although it gained substantial support in some areas in Slovenia (especially in parts of Slovenian Styria and in Lower Carniola), it remained far behind the conservative Slovene People's Party, its main political adversary. The Slovene Peasant Party only participated in the parliamentary elections of 1927. Between 1927 and 1929, it formed a united opposition front together with the Croatian Peasant Party and the Independent Democratic Party against the coalition government between the Serbian Radicals and the Slovene People's Party.  Aftermath  After the establishment of the January 6th Dictatorship in 1929, the Slovene Peasant Party was dissolved. Many of its former members, mostly from the Independent Agrarian Party, later joined the pro-regime Yugoslav National Party. Its left wing, on the other hand, re-organized itself around the youth movement known as Union of Peasant Boys and Girls, which was one of the strongest youth movements in Slovenia in the 1930s. In many areas, they formed the core of the Slovenian partisan resistance during World War II.

Exhibit design (or exhibition design) is the process of developing an exhibit‚Äîfrom a concept through to a physical, three-dimensional exhibition. It is a continually evolving field, drawing on innovative, creative, and practical solutions to the challenge of developing communicative environments that ‚Äòtell a story‚Äô in a three-dimensional space.MA Design for Exhibition and Museum, University of Lincoln, UK. Description Display stands for statues Showcase containing two stone tools from the Lower Paleolithic cave site of Darband, Exhibition, National Museum of Iran. Exhibit designers (or exhibition designers) use a wide range of technologies and techniques to develop experiences that will resonate with diverse audiences‚Äìenabling these targeted audiences to access the messages, stories and objects of an exhibit. There are many different types of exhibit, ranging from museum exhibitions, to retail and trades show spaces, to themed attractions, zoos, and visitor centers. All types of exhibits aim to communicate a message through engaging their audiences in meaningful and compelling interactions. Exhibit design is a collaborative process, integrating the disciplines of architecture, landscape architecture, graphic design, audiovisual engineering, digital media, lighting, interior design, and content development to develop an audience experience that interprets information, involves and engages a user and influences their understanding of a subject.Lee Skolnick, Jan Lorenc, and Craig Berger, What is Exhibition Design? 2007. Throughout the planning and design process, exhibit designers work closely with graphic designers, content specialists, architects, fabricators, technical specialists, audiovisual experts, and, in the case of museums and other mission-based institutions, stakeholders like community members, government agencies, and other partner organizations. The exhibit design process builds on a conceptual or interpretive plan for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. The first phases establish a thematic direction and develop creative and appropriate design solutions to achieve the interpretive and communication goals of the exhibit. The latter phases employ technical expertise in translating the visual language of the designs into detailed documents that provide all the specifications required to fabricate and install an exhibit. Exhibition design in different parts of the world are influenced by the local culture as well as the availability of materials. Exhibition design in Europe is considered as a meeting place for relationship building while in North America energy is spent on creating a sense of place and building community. One of the major shifts in museum and exhibit design in the last decade has been a focus on visitor experience. By identifying the five types of museum visitors and their needs and expectations, museums can design their exhibits to give a positive visitor experience. Participatory activities are also becoming more popular, Nina Simon has done research describing and identifying themes and trends in museums that will attract visitors and educate them in fun and engaging ways.

Plumas is roughly 70 km northwest of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, and about 150 km northwest of the provincial capital, Winnipeg. Geography In perspective, the elevation of Plumas is lower than Neepawa, but quite a bit higher than Portage la Prairie or Winnipeg. Despite the community's proximity to the Arden Ridge (a higher rise in the landscape located about 15 km west of Plumas, consisting of a series of hills and valleys, where the elevation rises 50 metres), Plumas is quite flat. Riding Mountain National Park is located about 35 km northwest of Plumas, where the land rises significantly to an elevation of almost 700 metres. Just 30 km east of Plumas lies Lake Manitoba, where the elevation is about 35 metres lower. The Jordan Creek flows through Plumas, and empties into the Big Grass Marsh (east of Plumas), one of North America's largest and well-regarded areas of marshland. The Whitemud River runs south of the village along Provincial Hwy 16. Farmland, meadows, forest, bush, and marsh surround the area. Jackfish Lake, also part of a protected wildlife/waterfowl area, is situated 16 km northeast of Plumas; the lake is a major gathering spot for thousands of migrating sandhill cranes passing through each year. Government The community is officially designated as a local urban district (LUD) within the Rural Municipality (RM) of Westbourne. David Single is currently the reeve of this RM. Though not a municipality of its own, Plumas has a committee as the local governing body that more or less plans community events and development, regards local issues within the community itself, and forms general decisions and recommendations that are intended to help resolve these issues. The committee consists of the chair, who is the councillor of Ward 4 of the RM (The LUD of Plumas is located within this ward), and three other committee members, elected by the community. Approximately 40% of the population voted in the October 2010 elections. The designated boundaries of the LUD do not include the houses on the north side of Queens Road, which are located in another ward, but are still counted as part of Plumas' urban population. History Plumas' history dates back to about 1872, when English settlers came to the area to farm. The land was fertile enough for growing crops, although not the best, yet affordable. In 1873, the community was originally named Jordan, named after the Jordan River located in Israel (Plumas also has a creek running through it still named the \\"Jordan Creek\\" today). Jordan School, one of the earliest schools in the district, was located in the northeast corner of the community, built sometime around 1873. Later on, as many as nine one-room schools existed within the Plumas School District. In 1879, the first post office was constructed. Jordan's name was later changed to Richmond in 1882. Again, sometime later, the community's name was changed to Plumas, after a man who had been in contact with Plumas County, California, came to settle here (The name \\"Plumas\\" is derived from the Spanish word \\"pluma,\\" meaning \\"feather.\\"). More immigrants, mainly of English, Irish, or Scottish descent, came to settle in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when they discovered that the land was fertile and cheap. In 1896, following the arrival of the Canadian National Railway (CNR), the already striving community began to really \\"take-off\\"; after a ten-year delay in the construction of this particular railway branch. The railway was quite important, as it transported freight, supplies, and passengers to and from Plumas. Throughout the years after 1900, the community's population was on a steady climb, when agriculture was a very prosperous industry. Where there were people, there was business. Plumas was a hub for the Westbourne Agricultural Region, offering many services and facilities to its surrounding residents. In 1925, when the Presbyterian, Methodist and Congregational Churches amalgamated to form the United Church of Canada, the Methodist and Presbyterian Churches in Plumas were physically joined together to form the community's own United Church; with one building being used for Sunday School and Fellowship, and the other a church sanctuary. During the Great Depression and World War II, Plumas wasn't hit as hard as some places, but farmers were very busy managing crops during those economically tough times. In 1951, Plumas' main street was paved. Around that time, the community also got electricity; however, in the 1940s Plumas had a generator which provided electricity to the community itself. Ukrainian and German populations increased in and around Plumas during the 1940s and 1950s. By the mid-20th century, Plumas had three hardware stores, three grain elevators, a clothing store, bowling alley and community hall, a local newspaper, four churches, two grocery stores, one grand hotel, two restaurants, a movie theatre, farm equipment and supplies outfits, a high school, and an elementary school. By this time, Plumas' population peaked at about 400 residents. After 1960, however, the striving community was near the end of its peak, as the agricultural industry began to slowly decline. Economy Agriculture still plays a role in keeping the community's economy strong, including trucking and transportation, and farming, although the three grain elevators that once stood, as well as the train station, are now gone. The main crop grown in the area is wheat. The primary type of livestock raised in the area is beef cattle. Beans, sunflowers, and feed crops (including oats and barley) are also farmed in the area. About 30 km southwest of Plumas, Neepawa is home to a large hog operation, currently employing over 1,000 people. Renegade Transport is currently based in Plumas, providing semi- trailer transportation of crops and fertilizer to communities across the province. Small retail outfits also play a role in the community's economy. Today, the community is experiencing a steady, but increasing population. The future expansion of the hog operation in Neepawa could possibly triple the employment at the plant, having a positive effect on the growth of the local area, including the community of Plumas. Many residents living in Plumas in other larger urban centres including Gladstone, Neepawa and Portage la Prairie, and commute on a regular basis. Climate Since Plumas is at a relatively higher elevation than Portage la Prairie or Gladstone, it usually sees frost and below zero temperatures before the rest of Southern Manitoba, in early to mid-autumn. Noting the proximity of Plumas to Lake Manitoba, intense weather systems are more likely to develop in this region, producing greater amounts of precipitation than in other locales further away from the lake, particularly during storms. Although Plumas is further away from Dauphin than Portage la Prairie, the community experiences more similar weather patterns to that of Dauphin. The Riding Mountains (a high escarpment of hilly terrain) also have an effect on the climate of the area. Here is an Environment Canada Weather Chart displaying climate data in McCreary, 50 km northwest. Attractions Plumas' motto was chosen to be \\"Proud to be Prairie,\\" which clearly matches the community's character and location. In the centre of the community (at intersection of Anderson Street and Burrows Avenue), stands a tower, which was formerly the town streetlight and fire/tornado siren. The KickAss Country Store, located on Burrows Avenue, is a quilting and fabric specialty store unique to Manitoba, offering material that cannot be found in Brandon, or even in downtown Winnipeg. Hunting is a popular outdoor activity in autumn around the Plumas area, attracting bird and game hunters from across Canada and the United States. The area is abundant with open landscapes, bush, marsh, and wildlife, mainly to the north and east of the community. Plumas is also home to the Plumas Memorial Community Gardens located downtown, designated a public site in 2005, and Lions Park, an open green area including a playground and a scenic area along Jordan Creek. The Plumas Fairgrounds located on Jordan Street, are home to the annual Plumas Agricultural Fair held every July, which hosts a display of market/garden items and homestyle crafts in the skating rink, 4-H cattle and horse shows, a midway, children's activities, a Show N' Shine Classic Car Display, catered meals, live entertainment, and a community parade & pancake breakfast to kick off the weekend. The fairgrounds also provide a baseball diamond, and livestock stables. The Plumas Pirates are the local junior baseball team, playing in tournaments across the province. The team practices and hosts home games right at the Plumas fairgrounds. In the spring, Plumas hosts a community-wide garage sale; in the fall, the Plumas Craft Sale and United Church fall supper are held; and in the winter, the citizens of Plumas organize an annual poker derby, where snowmobilers compete to complete a designated circuit before anyone else (collecting cards along the way at different waypoints along the trail), which starts and ends at the Plumas Inn. Cash prizes can be won. There are also old time dances and occasional live concerts or performances held at the Plumas Community Hall. February is the month where a few fun bonspiels take place at the curling rink. Outside the community, there are cairns, or dedication plaques, indicating the former locations of old school houses in the historic \\"Plumas School District,\\" which can be found down mile roads within a nine-mile radius of the community. \\"Heritage & Conservation\\" Driving Tours (created by local historical committees and conservation boards) are also a great way to visit and experience local historical sites and natural landmarks, scattered throughout the RM of Westbourne, Langford, and Lansdowne. Services and facilities The community currently has two churches, a skating rink and arena, curling rink, post office, the Austin Credit Union, a grocery store, community hall, senior's centre, senior's apartments, fire hall, service station, and many other local businesses. The Plumas Inn is located downtown as well, and includes a four-room motel, lounge, and family restaurant featuring Chinese food. The community is home to a very active \\"Services for Seniors\\" organization, which provides \\"Meals On Wheels\\" services to the seniors of Plumas, as well as other services. A recent program, developed by Plumas residents in May 2012, called \\"Let No One Be Alone\\" is designed to help seniors emotionally and physically, by providing them with support services and personal care in a number of ways. Currently, Plumas is up to date on local events through the Plumas website and a monthly \\"newspaper\\" calendar of events. There is a local Lions' Club in the community; also the Plumas Branch of the Royal Canadian Legion. Education Plumas Elementary School only has a student body of about 40, but houses four full classrooms ranging from grades K-8. Plumas High School was closed in the 1970s. High school students residing in Plumas now shuttle to Gladstone. Transportation Passenger rail service is provided by Via Rail at the Plumas railway station, only if previously arranged. Plumas is also situated at the corner of Provincial Roads 260 & 265\\\\. Provincial Highway 16, which runs east and west from Manitoba to British Columbia, lies 18 km south of Plumas.

They produce a basal rosette of evergreen leaves, from the center of which emerges a flowering scape. The scape produces a spike of many small white flowers. The flowers are zygomorphic in shape, and when perfect have six tepals, one pistil, and six stamens. However, not all individuals have perfect flowers. Many populations feature gynodioecy, and more rarely, androdioecy. They are native to China, Japan, and Korea, and typically grow in moist places in the temperate forests' understory. ; species * Chionographis chinensis K.Krause \\\\- Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan * Chionographis hisauchiana (Okuyama) N.Tanaka \\\\- Japan * Chionographis japonica (Willd.)

He was the second eldest son of Prince Albert of Prussia and his wife Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg. He is notable for composing music, in particular military waltzes. Family and early life Prince Joachim's paternal grandparents were Prince Albert of Prussia and Princess Marianne of the Netherlands. His maternal grandparents were Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg and Agnes of Anhalt-Dessau. Joachim had two brothers: Friedrich Heinrich Albrecht (1874‚Äì1940) and Friedrich Wilhelm (1880‚Äì1925). In 1885, Joachim's father Prince Albert was chosen as regent for the Duchy of Brunswick. Like all male Hohenzollerns, Joachim and his brothers entered the army and became officers. Music always appealed to him however, and he soon made a name for himself composing. In 1898, he presented a military waltz he wrote to a family gathering at the Neues Palais in Potsdam. An orchestra played it, while Emperor Wilhelm (another Hohenzollern lover and composer of music) conducted it with his baton. In 1905, he wrote the libretto and pantomime for \\"The Apple of Paris\\", which was well received in Berlin. He also composed ballets and symphonies, and wrote a volume of poetry and painted. During World War I, Joachim served with distinction until he received a war wound. This wound effectively ended his military career and allowed him to completely focus on his music. Marriages On 3 September 1909, Joachim married Marie Blich-Sulzer, divorced Baroness of Liebenberg, in Ischl, Austria. The marriage was never recognized by the family, and he had many public clashes with ex-Emperor Wilhelm. According to some sources, a previous marriage had led to Wilhelm banishing him by stationing him with the German colonial army in Africa; it is also believed that his resignation was demanded. His inheritance was also dramatically reduced. He married secondly to Karoline Kornelia Stockhammer on 9 October 1920 in Vienna. He and Karoline divorced in 1936. Joachim died three years later, on 24 October 1939. Music Like many of his family, Prince Joachim had a great love of music. Unlike the rest of them however, he spent his whole life playing and performing in different cities around the world. He also was an accomplished violin and cello player. He described himself as old-fashioned, especially in relation to music. He stated in 1927 that he was old-fashioned \\"because I am a thoroughly healthy individual. Much modern music is unnatural and discordant because composers and audiences have jaded nerves which need stirring up. I want my hearers to leave my concerts with the feeling that I have furnished them with esthetic [sic] delight and instilled harmony and beauty into their souls\\". In 1920, Joachim was ordered under arrest by the German Minister of Defense Gustav Noske after he got into a fight with some French military officers. The dispute apparently began after a few of the aforementioned officers failed to stand up when musicians in a nightclub began to play the national anthem \\"Deutschland Uber Alles\\". The fight soon escalated, so that many bystanders joined in to defend both sides. Although he later denied his actions, enough scorn emerged against him among most of Europe's newspapers to merit the event's impact on his reputation. In 1926, Joachim accepted an invitation to present his compositions in a series of concerts in leading American cities. He received this invite after playing in a number of welfare concerts in Berlin, and conducting his own works throughout the previous summer in Central Germany. One such concert was planned for Newark, in which Joachim would be conducting an orchestra to music written by himself. All of these concerts would have been done for various charitable organizations. After his arrival in the United States however, it soon emerged that he would do no performing while in the country.

Built in 1922 by the Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Company (a division of Alexander & Baldwin), which ran the community, it was erected on of land donated by the company in 1913. Upon completion, it replaced an earlier four-room school on the site that was built to hold 350 students. The Classical Revival 1922 two-story concrete building became Maui's largest elementary school with about 1000 students. In the 1950s the area went into decline, and the building was used for special education classes. In 1979 it became an administrative annex for the Department of Education. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hawaii on August 22, 2000. In 1937 Puunene School science teacher Soichi Sakamoto began training boys in a Three Year Swim Club to compete for the 1940 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to be held in Tokyo, Japan. Jose Balmores, Keo Nakama, \\"Bunny\\" Nakama, \\"Halo\\" Hirose, and Bill Smith swam 50-yd sprints against the 15 mph current (much clearer in those days) and went on to compete nationally but were never able to participate in the canceled 1940 and 1944 Olympics.

The one-cent sales tax initiative began in April 2010 and ended in December 2017. The structure of MAPS 3 is in the pay-as-you-go format of a Metropolitan Area Projects Plan including a temporary sales tax, multiple projects, and volunteer citizens oversight committee. History Following the passage of the original Metropolitan Area Projects Plan in December 1993 and the MAPS-for-Kids in 2001, and short term tax in 2008 for improvements at the Ford Center to secure the new NBA team, Oklahoma City Thunder the sales tax was set to expire. Mayor Mick Cornett solicited for public input on what projects should be included in a MAPS3 proposal. Prior to that time, the City had conducted various planning studies that ultimately impacted projects that were included in MAPS 3. Core to Shore Interstate 40 (I-40) is a major east-west transportation route, stretching from Wilmington, North Carolina to Barstow, California. The Oklahoma City Crosstown Expressway was an elevated four mile (6 km) stretch of Interstate 40 that dissected downtown Oklahoma City. Its original design in the 1960s was unique, but by the 1970s the design was recognized to be deficient. In 1996 the first of many public meetings were held to determine a plan of action. By 2006 the Crosstown Expressway was being used by just under twice the number of vehicles as was originally designed, and the bridge was declared to be \\"deteriorating.\\" Plans were made to relocate the interstate and demolish the Crosstown Expressway. In 2002 Federal funds were secured to relocate the interstate about five blocks south of the original location. The new route was through one of the city's original industrial areas, much of the land for the highway was subsequently found to have significant pollution from industrial waste. The interstate realignment, which followed the north shore of the Oklahoma River, in effect, opened significant land south of downtown Oklahoma City to redevelopment. In 2006, mayor Mick Cornett appointed to the 'Core to Shore' steering committee, a citizens advisory group tasked with developing a long term plan for redevelopment of the land between the original Crosstown Expressway route, which was the then southern border of the downtown core, to the shore of the Oklahoma River. The steering committee members and several ad hoc committees spent 13 months in a planning process that also included two public meetings to gather public input. The resulting Core to Shore Plan was a redevelopment blueprint that included a new 40-acre park along with a new convention center. Fixed Guideway Study The Association of Central Oklahoma Governments (ACOG) is one of Oklahoma's seven regional planning organizations; it is a voluntary association of city, town and county governments in the counties of Oklahoma, Cleveland, Canadian and Logan. In 2005 the Central Oklahoma Fixed Guideway Study (FGS) was completed and recommended feasible corridors for further investigation of commuter rail transit, bus rapid transit, a downtown Oklahoma City streetcar system, and an improved bus system to enhance connections among all public transportation services. Later, the City of Oklahoma City refined the study with its Greater Downtown Circulator Alternative Analysis, which was first planning step toward carrying out the metro area's Fixed Guideway Plan, and focused only on downtown and health center mobility. The Alternative Analysis recommended modern streetcar as the best overall transit technology and a 7.6 mile route. Leading up to the MAPS 3 Election The City conducted several public planning meetings when trying to determine the projects that might be contained in a third MAPS program. The Fixed Guideway and Core to Shore studies figured prominently in deliberations. Public transportation was popular as well as upgrades in parks and trails. The final proposal also included a $280 million convention center which was not publicly popular. The MAPS3 proposal faced fiercer opposition than both the earlier MAPS and MAPS- for-Kids proposals. Both Police and Fire Unions publicly opposed the plan because they felt it would strain resources needed for public safety. On December 8, 2009 the MAPS3 proposal passed by a 54-46 margin, the same margin as the original MAPS election. Citizens Advisory Board The MAPS 3 Citizens Advisory Board is an arm of City Government, subject to the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act and Open Records Act. The Board, with 11 volunteer members, generally holds televised public meetings on a monthly basis, and was created to review proposed MAPS 3 projects and submit recommendations to City Council. The board is the primary interface with the Program Architect that is in charge of coordinating the various projects, assuring that funding is available before a project starts, etc. Each of the eight projects of MAPS 3 has a citizen subcommittees, together consisting of more than 60 members that are appointed to provide additional input to the Citizens Advisory Board. Two members of the Advisory Board serve as the chair and vice-chair of each subcommittee. The subcommittees are the primary interface with a project's architect, and provide recommendations on site selections where necessary. Projects The projects all have a basic theme of enhancing the city's quality of life and include: *Convention Center ‚Äì Based on the current budget($252 million), the facility will be approximately square feet. This reflects approximately sf of sellable space, including exhibition halls, meeting rooms and ballrooms, that were originally described in the city's Core to Shore redevelopment plan. *Public Park ‚Äì current budget $132 million for a downtown park similar to Houston's Discovery Green. A previous design concept, developed for the City's Core to Shore redevelopment plan, may influence the final design of the Downtown Public Park. The recently renovated Myriad Botanical Gardens could also influence the types of facilities and programs included in the Downtown Public Park. The park will be constructed in two phases, a 40 acre phase I north of I-40 and a 30 acres phase II between I-40 and the river, connected by the SkyDance pedestrian bridge. *Modern Streetcar/Transit ‚Äì current budget $129 million. Based on the Fixed Guideway Study, streetcars provide flexibility and relative low cost compared to other rail alternatives and the city's \\"Alternative Analysis\\" recommended a route. Based on available funds, the MAPS 3 Transportation subcommittee recommended a route connects the St. Anthony Hospital Complex, the Downtown Bus Transit Center, Oklahoma City (Amtrak station), the future MAPS 3 Convention Center and Chesapeake Energy Arena, along with the Downtown Oklahoma City districts of Automobile Alley, Bricktown, Midtown, and runs a block from the future MAPS 3 Downtown Public Park. The construction will be in two phases; the second phase route has not been determined. Additional federal matching funds are expected to be available. Significant high density housing will need to be developed along the route for stable ridership. *$57 million for improvements to the Oklahoma River Boathouse District, (headquarters for USA Canoe/Kayak and a training center for USRowing). There will be a new whitewater facility will offer rafting, kayaking and canoeing for all skill levels. Also included will be a Lighting and windscreens for the first 1,000 meters of the racecourse, and a starting system for the race facility, housed in the Chesapeake Finish Line Tower. *$58 million for improvements at the Oklahoma State Fair, including a new expo building. The projects funded were initially identified in the Oklahoma State Fair Master Plan *$39 million to extend about of bicycle and running trails that would connect major city parks and other public spaces, to be constructed in three phases. The need for additional trails was initially established in the 1997 Oklahoma City Trails Master Plan and the 2008 Bicycle Transportation Plan *$9 million to build between and of sidewalks around the city, to be constructed in two phases. It has been known for several years that there is a need for additional sidewalks in Oklahoma City, both from the standpoint of Walkability and making the city more accessible. *$50 million for four health and wellness aquatic centers to be located throughout the city, with each center designed to meet the needs of the surrounding community. The Wellness Centers would be operated by an independent contractor who would help design the facility. In many ways, the Health and Wellness, while one of the more popular projects, is also one of the more contentious of the projects. There were no previous studies to lay the groundwork for defining the project. It is also the project that has the most direct involvement of the City Council because, according to Councilperson Meg Salyer, \\"Everybody seems to have a slightly different understanding of what Wellness means\\". As of the middle of 2014, multiple Requests For Proposals had been issued to potential operators and locations, but only two of the proposed four had been selected. Recognizing that the city's economy may fluctuate during the time of the sales tax collection, and that there may be unforeseen project contingencies, the program also has a significant Infrastructure/Contingency component. Included is a $47 million contingency, originally intended to be used to relocate a power station near the original convention center site next to the 'Core to Shore' neighborhood and the new 'Oklahoma Boulevard' to replace the old Crosstown Expressway space. However, since a new site was selected by the Maps III Convention Center committee that is closer to the central business district, the funds will remain in contingency to be used as needed for any of the main projects.

Background The town of Ramla lay on the road from Jerusalem to Ascalon, the latter of which was the largest Fatimid fortress in Palestine. From Ascalon the Fatimid vizier, Al-Afdal Shahanshah, launched almost annual attacks into the newly founded Crusader kingdom from 1099 to 1107. It was thrice the case that the two armies met each other at Ramla. Egyptian armies of the period relied on masses of Sudanese bowmen supported by Arab and Berber cavalry. Since the archers were on foot and the horsemen awaited attack with lance and sword, an Egyptian army provided exactly the sort of immobile target that the Frankish heavy cavalry excelled in attacking. Whereas the Crusaders developed a healthy respect for the harass and surround tactics of the Turkish horse archers, they tended to discount the effectiveness of the Egyptian armies. While overconfidence led to a Crusader disaster at the second battle of Ramla, the more frequent result was a Fatimid defeat. \\"The Franks never, until the reign of Saladin, feared the Egyptian as they did the armies from Muslim Syria and Mesopotamia.\\"Smail, p. 87 Battle Despite defeat to the crusaders at the first Battle of Ramla the previous year, al-Afdal was soon ready to strike at the crusaders once again and dispatched around 20,000 troops under the command of his son Sharaf al-Ma'ali. Baldwin I of Jerusalem was in Jaffa seeing off survivors of the defeated Crusade of 1101, when news reached him of the Fatimid invasion force. William of Aquitaine had already departed, but many others such as Stephen of Blois and Count Stephen of Burgundy had been forced back due to unfavorable winds and consequently joined Baldwin's force in order to help in the battle. Due to faulty reconnaissance Baldwin severely underestimated the size of the Egyptian army, believing it to be no more than a minor expeditionary force, and rode to face an army of several thousand with only two hundred mounted knights and no infantry. Realizing his error too late and already cut off from escape, Baldwin and his army were charged by the Egyptian forces and many were quickly slaughtered, although Baldwin and a handful of others managed to barricade themselves in Ramla's single tower. Baldwin was left with no other option than to flee and escaped the tower under the cover of night with just his scribe and a single knight, Hugh of Brulis, who is never mentioned in any source afterwards. Baldwin spent the next two days evading Fatimid search parties until he arrived exhausted, starved, and parched in the reasonably safe haven of Arsuf on May 19. The situation of the remaining knights in Ramla deteriorated when Fatimid forces stormed the town on the morning after Baldwin's escape, with only the tower remaining under Crusader control. The Fatimids ruthlessly attacked the tower, undermining walls and setting fires to smoke out the desperate defenders. After a day of desperately holding their ground the remaining knights, all but abandoned by their king, decided to launch a suicidal last stand and charged the besiegers. Almost all of the meagre force was immediately slain including Stephen of Blois, who finally restored the honour that he lost when he deserted the Siege of Antioch four years previously. However, Conrad of Germany, the constable of Henry IV who had previously led a contingent at the Crusade of 1101, fought so valiantly that even after everyone around him was dead he still fought on, holding off the Fatimids to the point that his awestruck foe offered to spare his life if he surrendered. Siege of Jaffa and Aftermath Having recuperated in Arsuf, Baldwin commandeered an English pirate ship to break through the Egyptian blockade of Jaffa while a force of eighty knights under Hugh of Falchenburg attempted to break in by land. The victorious Sharaf al- Ma'ali had surrounded the city and, with their king missing and the army presumed destroyed, capitulation seemed inevitable. In order to coax the city into surrender, the Fatimids made the corpse of Gerbod of Scheldewindeke, a knight who had fallen in battle previously,http://www.medievalgenealogy.org.uk/families/gundred/gundocs.shtml#1102 Plurimis deinde diebus evolutis et conventu Christianorum de die in diem comminuto, aliis redeuntibus navigio, aliis per diversas regiones in reditu suo dispersis [a list of names, including] Gerbodo de castello Winthinc[1] ...

Gerbod had apparently held a resemblance to Baldwin and the crusaders fell for the ruse, with preparations to flee the city underway when Baldwin arrived just in time. Baldwin's arrival disheartened and Sharaf withdrew, allowing Baldwin time to organize a counterattack. With Baldwin's forces strengthened by the arrival of a fleet of French and German Crusaders, he was able to assemble an army of eight thousand menDupuy, p. 316 and surprised the unprepared Egyptians. Discontent was already arising from Sharaf's indecisive leadership and the Fatimids quickly retreated back to Ascalon. Although Baldwin succeeded in defending his kingdom, his miscalculation had cost the lives of a number of prominent knights which the nascent Kingdom of Jerusalem could ill afford to lose. Further Fatimid incursions continued, with the two nations meeting in battle at Ramla for a third time in 1105. CitationsBibliography *Dupuy, R. E. and T. N. Dupuy, eds.

Baldwin had only 260 cavalry and 900 foot soldiers under his command, leaving him severely outnumbered by the Egyptian army, which was estimated at 32,000 men by Fulcher of Chartres, and downgraded to 3,000‚Äì5,000 by modern historians. Upon sighting the Fatimid army, Baldwin arrayed his force in six divisions, commanding the reserve force himself. In the initial attack, the first two Crusader divisions were wiped out while the vanguard took heavy casualties too, with Geldemar Carpinel among the slain. The battle seemed to be lost, but when the third division was pursued after being routed by the Egyptians, Baldwin ordered a counter-attack and committed his reserve. In vicious close-quarter combat, the Crusaders repulsed the Egyptian forces, who retreated in panic as rank after rank buckled under the force of Baldwin's attack. After pursuing the fleeing Fatimids to Ascalon, Baldwin returned to Ramla to plunder the Egyptian camp. This success secured the Kingdom of Jerusalem against the Fatimid Caliphate's advances for the campaigning season. According to Fulcher of Chartres, who was present at the battle, the Fatimids lost around 5,000 men in the battle, including their general Saad al-Daulah. However, Crusader losses were heavy too, losing 80 knights and a large amount of infantry. Aftermath The battle had so nearly been a defeat for the Crusaders, and while the Fatimid survivors fled to Ascalon the remnants of the vanguard that was crushed earlier in the battle themselves fled to Jaffa. So great was the confusion after the battle that around 500 Fatimid troops advanced to the walls of Jaffa, where survivors of the Latin vanguard informed Baldwin's wife Arda that the king and all his men were dead. A letter was immediately sent north to Antioch to ask Tancred, regent of Antioch in the place of Bohemond of Antioch, for assistance. Jaffa did not immediately capitulate, and when Baldwin returned victorious the following day the remaining Egyptian forces quickly scattered. Ascalon remained in Fatimid hands, however, and a miscalculation would prove very costly to Baldwin when the two sides once again met at Ramla the following year. Fatimid armies Egyptian armies of the period relied on masses of Sudanese bowmen supported by Arab and Berber cavalry. Since the archers were on foot and the horsemen awaited attack with lance and sword, an Egyptian army provided exactly the sort of immobile target that the Frankish heavy cavalry excelled in attacking. Except for the third battle of Ramla in 1105, when Toghtekin of Damascus sent a contingent of Turks to help the Egyptians, the Fatimids did not use horse archers. Whereas the Crusaders developed a healthy respect for the harass and surround tactics of the Turkish horse archers, they tended to discount the effectiveness of the Egyptian armies. While overconfidence led to a Crusader disaster at the second battle of Ramla, the more frequent result was a Fatimid defeat. \\"The Franks never, until the reign of Saladin, feared the Egyptian as they did the armies from Muslim Syria and Mesopotamia.\\"Smail, p. 87 CitationsBibliography *Dupuy, R.

Born in a small town in the state of Sinaloa, Torres F√©lix began working for the Sinaloa Cartel in the 1990s and later ascended to the apex of the cartel after his brother Javier Torres F√©lix was arrested in 2004. He then began to work with Ovidio Guzm√°n L√≥pez, the son of Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera, Mexico's most-wanted man, and oversaw drug trafficking shipments coming in from South America into Mexico under the tutelage of Ismael Zambada Garc√≠a. When his son was killed by rival gang members of the Beltr√°n-Leyva Cartel in 2008, Torres F√©lix reportedly lost his mind and went on a killing spree, torturing the perpetrators at his home in Culiac√°n. This earned him the nickname of \\"El Ondeado\\" ('The Crazy One') for his emotional instability and explosive personality. Torres F√©lix was gunned down and killed in a clash with the Mexican Army on 13 October 2012. Criminal career Jos√© Manuel Torres F√©lix was born on 28 February 1958 in the town of Llanos del Refugio in Cosal√°, Sinaloa. He had worked for the Sinaloa Cartel since 1990, but ascended to a high-ranking position after the capture of his brother Javier Torres F√©lix in 2004. Along with Ovidio Guzm√°n L√≥pez, the son of Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera, Torres F√©lix oversaw drug shipments coming in from South America into the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. In September 2008 under the Operation Sinaloa, the Mexican military located a safe house owned by Torres F√©lix, where they confiscated several firearms, narcotics, radio communications equipment, and an armored vehicle. The Mexican military also found a photo of Torres F√©lix accompanied by Misael Torres Urrea, nicknamed El M2, his nephew and son of Javier Torres F√©lix. Torres F√©lix was placed on the most-wanted drug traffickers list under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act by the U.S. government on 1 June 2011, along with Gonzalo Inzunza Inzunza (a.k.a. El Macho Prieto), another high-ranking lieutenant of the Sinaloa cartel. The PGR offers up to $3 million Mexican pesos for information leading to their arrests. Manuel reportedly lived in the hills and valleys of Sinaloa, rarely frequenting urban areas. He would often go two or three days without sleep, always in alert. Death of his son According to the United States Department of the Treasury, Torres F√©lix got public attention on 18 April 2008 when rival members of the Beltr√°n-Leyva Cartel assassinated his son Atanasio Torres Acosta in an ambush attack, injuring his daughter Alondra (aged 4) and sister-in-law Sandra Rivas Heredia (aged 24). At the crime scene, the gunmen left a written message on the behalf of Arturo Beltr√°n Leyva: With the death of his son, Torres F√©lix reportedly \\"went crazy\\" and took revenge of the perpetrators by torturing them in his home. According to police reports, the death of Anastasio marked the beginning of the cartel war in the state of Sinaloa. Torres F√©lix became one of the most dangerous drug traffickers in Sinaloa; hundreds of deaths were attributed to the commandos led by Torres F√©lix, who earned the pseudonym of \\"El Ondeado\\" ('The Crazy One') for his emotional instability that started after the death of Atanasio. Death Torres F√©lix was killed in a gunbattle in the community of Oso Viejo in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa early in the morning on 13 October 2012. His body was sent to the forensic center and was guarded by the military in order to prevent his henchmen from snatching the body. After the shootout, the military confiscated several stashes of weapons, ammunition, and other materials. Prior to his death, Torres F√©lix was a key figure and major drug trafficker for Ismael Zambada Garc√≠a and Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera, Mexico's most wanted man. Funeral After his death, Torres F√©lix's corpse was sent to the San Mart√≠n funeral house in Culiac√°n, where family members and friends visited to pay their respects. Outside the parlor, the Mexican Army guarded the area and established checkpoints in the nearby streets. Torres F√©lix was then buried in Jardines Del Humaya, a cemetery outside the city of Culiac√°n where the remains of his son Anastasio lie too. Aftermath The Mexican Armed Forces increased their presence in the state of Sinaloa to prevent any violent reprisals from organized crime for Torres F√©lix's death. A Facebook page was set up just hours after his death, which include personal photos. As of November 2012 the page has nearly 40,000 fans. On the morning of 16 October 2012, three days after the death of Torres F√©lix, at least three \\"narcomantas\\" ('narcobanners') appeared throughout the city of Culiac√°n denouncing Ismael Zambada Garc√≠a of betraying and setting up Torres F√©lix to be killed by the Mexican Army. Analysis of repercussions According to the Mexican Army, the death of Torres F√©lix dealt a huge blow against the internal structure of the Sinaloa Cartel because he was the right-hand man of Zambada Garc√≠a and a major administrative figure in the organization. InSight Crime, on the other hand, believes that it is unclear exactly how much impact Torres F√©lix's absence will have on the cartel. Given the organization's immense size and influence, the agency alleges that Torres F√©lix will not affect the overall drug trafficking logistics of the Sinaloa Cartel. His death, however, can serve as a reminder that the Mexican government is willing to take down top leaders in the Sinaloa Cartel in their home turf. If what the authorities say is true about Torres F√©lix's importance, Zambada Garc√≠a is probably uneasy by the news. At the same time, however, InSight Crime points out that Zambada Garc√≠a may have purposely set up Torres F√©lix to get killed. Family Manuel is brother of Javier Torres F√©lix (a.k.a. El JT), a close associate and leader of a group of hitmen headed by Ismael Zambada, a drug lord of the Sinaloa cartel; Javier was arrested in 2004 and extradited to the United States in December 2006. The son of Javier is Misael Torres Urrea, M-2. Ra√∫l Meza Ontiveros, El M-6, was the brother-in-law of Manuel; he was killed by gunfire in March 2007. His sons were C√©sar Ra√∫l Meza Torres El Mini-6, and Arturo Meza Torres, and his brother was Faustino Meza Ontiveros, killed on 8 January 2009. On 18 April 2008, Atanacio Torres Acosta, the 20-year-old son of Manuel, was shot dead in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa. His daughter Alondra (aged 4) was injured in the attack and subsequently lost her forearm. The next day, Manuel responded by killing two gunmen allegedly responsible for killing his son. Joel Torres Jim√©nez, the son of Javier and nephew of Manuel, was shot in Culiac√°n with three other people on 28 February 2010. Joel Torres is still alive today though being attacked 3 occasions and surviving. His nephew, and son of Ra√∫l Meza Ontiveros, was Ra√∫l Meza Torres, El Mini 6, who was killed in Zapopan, Jalisco, on 25 April 2010 after a shootout with the police. Arturo Salazar Aispuro, alias El Tury and a nephew of Manuel, was killed with four other gunmen on 24 January 2011 in Mexicali. The son-in-law of Manuel, Onorio F√©lix Guti√©rrez, was ambushed and killed by a group of gunmen in Culiac√°n on 18 March 2011. He was married to Yazira Torres, the daughter of Manuel, and the couple had a male before divorcing. His nephew Francisco Torres, alias El 50, was killed in a gunfight with the Mexican Army in Culiac√°n on 3 July 2013. Francisco was a main operator of the Sinaloa Cartel in that city, responsible for carrying out several violent acts and overseeing the retail drug sales.

He studied composition with Professor Tadeusz Paciorkiewicz at the Fryderyk Chopin Academy of Music in Warsaw. He also holds a degree in oboe. In 1986 he received two awards in composition: the first one, at the Young Composers' Competition, for his Wind Quintet; and, the second one, at the G. Fitelberg Competition for his A tre for a large symphony orchestra. In 1992-93, having been awarded a grant by the French Government, he studied at the √âcole Normale de Musique in Paris. In his compositions, Stradomski seeks new solutions in the domain of construction rather than new effects in sound. In some works, he employs serialist or dodecaphonic techniques, though not treating them rigoristically. He draws on the experience of aleatorism and uses elements of jazz, combining them with different composing techniques that he invented (often for the use of a single work). In 1984-2001, he organised concerts (of contemporary music as well) at the Warsaw Music Society. He is also a performing artist, playing old and contemporary music on the oboe and, in more recent times, on the piano. Literary works In 1995, he debuted as a writer. He wrote six books: The Sexual Life of Moomintrolls, The View From a Room Without Windows, Russian Watch or Eternal Love, All President‚Äôs Girl-Friends, The President‚Äôs Return, The President‚Äôs Secret and four theater plays: The Lawn, The Godfather‚Äôs son, The Dolt and The Contrabassoonist.

The caves are inside Sierra del Fraile mountain and protected area. The easiest way to reach the entrance to the caves is by taking a five-minute ride on the aerial tramway, but there is a steep path that can be taken to reach the caves. History The caves are thought to have formed between 50 and 60 million years ago. During the prehistoric era, the caves were submerged in sea water, and that is the reason marine fossils like sea shells and snail shells can be seen on the cave walls. Grutas de Garc√≠a remained hidden for thousands of years until 1843. Priest Juan Antonio Sobrevilla discovered the caves during a casual excursion through the mountains. Structure The caves inside look like a rocky desert landscape with a longitude of 300 meters and 105 meters deep. From the entrance two different paths emerge descending 105 meters: one is about 2.5 kilometers and has 16 different chambers; the other is 1 kilometer long with 11 chambers. Like most caves these maintain a temperature around 18 ¬∞C (65 ¬∞F). Inside the caves impressive rock formations are observed that fill the space in the large chambers. There are many interesting stalagmites and stalactites. One of the most spectacular chambers is known as ‚ÄúEl sal√≥n de la luz‚Äù (The Light Chamber) named because of the natural clarity of the rock on the ceiling allowing light from outside to filter through. ‚ÄúLa octava maravilla‚Äù (The Eighth Wonder) is a formation in the cave where a stalagmite connected with a stalactite to form a column. ‚ÄúEl sal√≥n del aire‚Äù (The Air Chamber) exhibits a balcony that is 40 meters high. ‚ÄúEl mirador de la mano‚Äù, is a stalagmite that formed a shape that resembles a human hand. There are numerous other formations that are fascinating like: ‚ÄúEl Nacimiento‚Äù (The Nativity), ‚ÄúLa Fuente Congelada‚Äù (The Frozen Fountain), \\"La Torre China‚Äù (The Chinese Tower), ‚ÄúEl teatro‚Äù (The Theatre), and ‚ÄúEl √Årbol de Navidad‚Äù (The Christmas Tree).

The British objective was to capture supplies and equipment from the U.S. military store depot at Black Rock, New York. The raid was a success but the British force suffered substantial casualties as they returned to their landing-point. The Raid Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Bisshopp set out in the early hours of 11 July 1813, with 20 men of the Royal Artillery, 40 of the 1st Battalion, 8th (King's) Regiment, 100 of the 1st Battalion, 41st Regiment, 40 of the 49th Regiment and 40 of the 2nd and 3rd Regiments of Lincoln Militia.James, p. 228, for composition of force.

One hundred and fifty New York Militia under the command of Major Parmenio Adams, who had been stationed at Fort Gibson to defend Black Rock, fledCruikshank, p. 223 and volume index for Major Adams' first name. and Bisshopp's men set to work. They spiked two 12-pounder and two 6-pounder guns at the batteries and made off with another 12-pounder, two 9-pounders, 177 muskets, several kegs of ammunition, quantities of round shot and canister shot, a large amount of army clothing and seven large bateaux and a scow which were loaded with 180 barrels of provisions. They burned the blockhouse and barracks at both the batteries and the navy yard, and also a schooner.James, p. 229 Meanwhile, Brigadier General Peter B. Porter of the New York Militia, whose own house was nearby, had gathered a force to oppose the invaders. Porter's force was composed of Captain Cummings' company of U.S. regulars, 80‚Äì90 men rallied from Major Adams' garrison, 50 Buffalo Militia under Captain Bell, 30 Seneca warriors allied to the United States, and a field-piece. The American force ambushed Bisshopp's column in the dark as they marched along the beach. The British force re-crossed to Canada with all of their plunder but not without significant casualties.Cruikshank, pp. 224‚Äì225 The worst loss for the British was the \\"able and enterprising\\" Lieutenant Colonel Bisshopp, who later died of his wounds.Quimby, p. 302 It was said that the British withdrawal was unduly delayed to secure several hundred prized bags of salt.Hitsman, p.164 Casualties The British official casualty return gave 13 killed, 25 wounded, 4 \\"wounded and missing\\" and 2 missing. Captain Saunders of the 41st Regiment was returned as \\"wounded\\", although he was also taken prisoner. However, the Americans captured 17 prisoners, 4 of them wounded, which would indicate that 10 of the men who were thought to have been killed were in fact captured. The fact that the American report detailed only 4 wounded prisoners, including Captain Saunders, would indicate that one of the men returned as \\"wounded and missing\\" was captured unwounded. This gives a revised British casualty total of 3 killed, 24 wounded, 4 wounded prisoners and 13 other prisoners. The American loss was 3 militiamen killed, 4 militiamen and 2 Seneca warriors wounded.

It is formulated in combination with dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide (DHPA; algestone acetophenide), a progestin, and is used specifically as a combined injectable contraceptive. Estradiol enantate is not available for medical use alone. The medication, in combination with DHPA, is given by injection into muscle once a month. Side effects of estradiol enantate include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, nausea, headache, and fluid retention. Estradiol enantate is a synthetic estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is an estrogen ester and a long-lasting prodrug of estradiol in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. Estradiol enantate was first described by 1954, and was first studied in combination with DHPA as a combined injectable contraceptive in 1964. The combination was introduced for clinical use by the mid-1970s. Estradiol enantate is not available as a standalone medication (i.e., by itself without DHPA). The combination is available in Latin America and Hong Kong, and was also previously marketed in Spain and Portugal. Medical uses Estradiol enantate is used in combination with the progestin DHPA as a once-monthly combined injectable contraceptive for women in Latin America and Hong Kong. Estradiol enantate has been studied in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women as well. The combination of estradiol enantate and DHPA has likewise been used by transgender women (referred to as \\"travestis\\" in some cultures, especially in South America) for such purposes. Available forms The following forms of estradiol enantate are or have been available for use: * Estradiol enantate 10 mg and DHPA 150 mg (brand names Perlutal, Topasel, many others) * Estradiol enantate 5 mg and DHPA 75 mg (brand names Anafertin, Patector NF, Yectames) * Estradiol enantate 10 mg and DHPA 120 mg (brand names Unalmes, Yectuna) * Estradiol enantate 10 mg and DHPA 75 mg (brand name Ova Repos; discontinued) A 6 mg estradiol enantate and 90 mg DHPA formulation was also studied, but was never marketed. The combination of estradiol enantate and DHPA has also been studied at other doses ranging from 5 to 50 mg estradiol enantate and 75 to 200 mg DHPA. The combination of estradiol enantate and DHPA is provided in ampoules at estradiol enantate concentrations of 5 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL. Contraindications Contraindications of estrogens include coagulation problems, cardiovascular diseases, liver disease, and certain hormone- sensitive cancers such as breast cancer and endometrial cancer, among others. Side effects The side effects of estradiol enantate are the same as those of estradiol. Examples of such side effects include breast tenderness and enlargement, nausea, bloating, edema, headache, and melasma. The combination of estradiol enantate and DHPA as a combined injectable contraceptive has shown no adverse effects on liver function, lipid metabolism, or coagulation. A case report of a prolactinoma in a transgender women treated with 10 mg estradiol enantate every 2 weeks exists.Camara, V. L., Zanardi, U. V., Glezer, A., Paraiba, D. B., Bronstein, M.

Symptoms of estrogen overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, bloating, increased weight, water retention, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, heavy legs, and leg cramps. These side effects can be diminished by reducing the estrogen dosage. Interactions Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 may influence the metabolism of estradiol and by extension circulating estradiol levels. Pharmacology Estradiol, the active form of estradiol enantate. Pharmacodynamics Estradiol enantate is an estradiol ester, or a prodrug of estradiol. As such, it is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors. Estradiol enantate is of about 41% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C17Œ≤ enantate ester. Because estradiol enantate is a prodrug of estradiol, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. The combination of 10 mg estradiol enantate and 150 mg DHPA as a once-monthly combined injectable contraceptive (which achieves levels of estradiol of around 350 pg/mL) has been found to have little to no effect on many markers of estrogen-modulated liver protein synthesis, including circulating levels of HDL and LDL cholesterol, copper, ceruloplasmin, total and free cortisol, corticosteroid- binding globulin, and sex hormone-binding globulin. However, it was found to significantly increase levels of triglycerides and to significantly decrease levels of total and free testosterone. In contrast to the estradiol enantate- containing combined injectable contraceptive, low-dose ethinylestradiol- containing birth control pills produce highly significant changes in all of the preceding parameters. Studies in women and female capuchin monkeys have found that injections of estradiol enantate and DHPA significantly alter levels of coagulation factors.Oliva Filho, W. M., & Santos, N. da C. (1992). Efeitos na coagula√ß√£o sanguinea em usu√°rias da associa√ß√£o acetofenido de dihidroxiprogesterona 150mg e enantato de estradiol 10mg como metodo anticoncepcional injetavel. Universidade de S√£o Paulo, S√£o Paulo. https://bdpi.usp.br/item/000736190 The clinical estrogenic effects of estradiol enantate and ethinylestradiol have been compared in other studies as well. Pharmacokinetics When estradiol enantate is administered in an oil solution by intramuscular injection, a depot effect occurs, and this results in it having a long duration of action. The duration of action of estradiol enantate is considerably longer than that of various other estradiol esters, such as estradiol benzoate, estradiol valerate, and estradiol cypionate, whereas its duration is shorter than that of estradiol undecylate. In general, the longer the fatty acid ester chain, the more lipophilic the estradiol ester, the more slowly it is released from the depot and absorbed into the circulation, and the longer its duration of action. The pharmacokinetics of estradiol enantate have been assessed in a number of studies. It has usually been studied in combination with DHPA. Following an intramuscular injection of estradiol enantate, levels of estradiol have been found to peak after 3 to 8 days. Maximal levels of estradiol after a 5 mg injection of estradiol enantate have been found to be about 163 to 209 pg/mL and after a 10 mg injection of estradiol enantate have been found to be about 283 to 445 pg/mL. However, one outlying study reported peak estradiol levels of 850 pg/mL after an intramuscular injection of 10 mg estradiol enantate in three postmenopausal women. It used radioimmunoassay for the determinations, with no mention of chromatographic separation. Estradiol levels following an intramuscular injection of 10 mg estradiol enantate have been found to return to baseline levels of around 50 pg/mL after about 20 to 30 days. However, a metabolic study found that traces of radiolabeled estradiol enantate remained detectable in blood for at least 30 to 40 days and for as long as 60 days. Studies have reported that the elimination half-life of estradiol enantate after a single 10 mg intramuscular injection was 5.6 to 7.5 days. The volume of distribution of estradiol enantate has been reported to be 5.087 L. Estradiol enantate is excreted preferentially in urine. There were concerns about possible accumulation of estradiol enantate and consequent estrogenic overexposure with once-monthly combined injectable contraceptives containing the medication due its long duration, and this may have limited the use of such combined injectable contraceptives. Subsequent clinical studies have found that there is very limited or no accumulation of estradiol enantate when it is used in once-a-month injectable contraceptives. Chemistry Estradiol enantate, also known as estradiol 17Œ≤-enantate or estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17Œ≤-diol 17Œ≤-heptanoate, is a synthetic estrane steroid and the C17Œ≤ enantate (heptanoate) fatty acid ester of estradiol. Other common esters of estradiol used clinically include estradiol benzoate, estradiol cypionate, estradiol undecylate, and estradiol valerate. Estradiol dienantate (component of Climacteron), or estradiol 3,17Œ≤-dienantate, has also been used. The experimental octanol/water partition coefficient (logP) of estradiol enanthate is 6.7 to 7.3.http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.19815.html History Estradiol enantate was first described, along with a variety of other estradiol esters, by Karl Junkmann of Schering AG in 1953. The first clinical study of estradiol enantate and DHPA as a combined injectable contraceptive was conducted in 1964. The combination was marketed by the mid-1970s. Society and culture=Generic names Estradiol enantate is the British English generic name of the medication and its and , while estradiol enanthate is its and American English generic name. Its generic names in other languages are as follows: * French: enantate d'estradiol and estradiol enantate * German: estradiol enantat * Italian: estradiolo enantato * Portuguese and Spanish: enantato de estradiol and estradiol enantato Estradiol enantate is also known by its former developmental code name SQ-16150.

They released their first self-titled EP in late spring of 2005. Soon after, they invited bassist Dave Sunderland and keyboardist Susan Gager to join the live act. The trio continued to write and record and in February 2007 they released Copper Street Performer produced by John McEntire. In April 2008, the now five-piece began recording what would become their first full-length album Passenger with Brian McTear of Miner Street Studios. During this time the band experienced inner turmoil as Blair and Guceri ended their relationship. This in turn fueled a surge of material and Passenger was completed and self- released in January 2009. The group continued to tour and write throughout 2010 and recorded a five-song EP in early 2011 at The Studio in Philadelphia, PA. The Spells EP was released in June 2011.

Located in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts, and founded in 1977, \\"GUS\\" is named after the Urquhart Clan in Scotland, ancestors of the founders David and Lynne Warren.  History  Established in 1977 as North Shore Middle School, in a local church, Glen Urquhart School took residence on the former 23-acre Orchidvale Estate in Beverly Farms in 1982. The campus location is where Albert Burrage had raised thousands of varieties of orchids in 28 greenhouses. When the school moved to the former Orchidvale property, it adopted its present name, Glen Urquhart School. The school chose the Scottish surname of Urquhart and combined it with \\"glen,\\" the word for a green,shady place (replacing the word \\"vale\\" in the property's former name), creating the name Glen Urquhart. The school's motto, \\"Meane Weil. Speak Weil. Doe Weil.,\\" is taken from the Urquhart Clan in Scotland. \\"Trust and go forward\\" is the Urquhart clan battle cry. Both phrases appear in the GUS school song, written by Georgia Bills. Today, Glen Urquhart, known as \\"GUS,\\" has approximately 200 students from 25 towns and cities on the North Shore of Boston. Curriculum and programming continues to be informed by a commitment to knowledge, creativity, and character.  Academics  GUS offers an academic program beginning with pre-k through 8th grade. The school enrolls approximately 200 students across lower school (K-5) classrooms and upper school (6-8) grades. An experiential- and theme-based curriculum unfolds year by year, with kindergarten students studying \\"The World Around Us,\\" then progressing through \\"Who Am I?' (First Grade), \\"Where Do I Live?\\" (Second Grade), \\"Where Am I Going?\\" (Third Grade), \\"The Sea\\" (Fourth Grade), \\"The Land\\" (Fifth Grade), \\"The People\\" (Sixth Grade) and returning to \\"Who Am I?\\" (Seventh Grade) and \\"Where Do I Live? Where Am I Going?\\" (Eighth Grade). These themes are based in child development theory such as the work of Jean Piaget and John Dewey and are enhanced by Harvard's Project Zero, which all GUS teachers participate in as part of their professional development. All students take a course of study including math, English/Language Arts, science, social studies, and Spanish. Spanish culture and language instruction is offered in all grades, beginning in kindergarten. Service learning projects beginning in kindergarten and culminating in an eighth grade work week teach students about their community and global responsibilities. Partners include The Food Project and Beverly Bootstraps. An outdoor classroom, nature trail, and 7,000 square foot greenhouse provide settings for hands-on environmental and science study.  Arts + Athletics  From their earliest days at GUS, students take classes in the visual arts, in both vocal and instrumental music, in dance, and in drama. In the lower grades, kindergarten through five, students take regular classes in art, music, and dance. In the sixth grade, dance evolves into drama, where their dance skills translate into choreography for their dramatic productions and musicals. By the time they are in eighth grade, the arts curriculum culminates in a student art show that includes oral presentations about their art, a dance recital involving individual and group choreography, and the performance of a Broadway musical involving all eighth grade students. Physical education and interscholastic sports are also vital to fostering well-being, collaboration, and a readiness for competition. GUS students compete in soccer, cross-country, track and field, basketball, and lacrosse, acquiring the physical and mental foundation to become valuable players, captains, and All-Americans on high school and college teams.  Campus Resources  The GUS campus includes seven buildings and spreads over 23 acres of woodland, marsh, and glen in the North Shore neighborhood of Beverly Farms.

The explicatures of a sentence are what is explicitly said, often supplemented with contextual information. They contrast with implicatures, the information that the speaker conveys without actually stating it. The truth value of a sentence is determined using its explicature. For example: Imagine Jim and Raoul are driving across America from New York City to Seattle, Washington. Raoul is driving, and Jim falls asleep. When Jim wakes up, he asks Raoul, \\"Where are we?\\" Raoul replies, \\"We aren't there yet, but we've passed Chicago.\\" If Jim and Raoul's car is in fact five minutes outside Seattle and Raoul knows this, he may be accused of lying, since \\"We aren't there yet, but we've passed Chicago\\" in that context has the implicature \\"We are not too far past Chicago and still not near Seattle.\\" Technically, however, Raoul's statement was true, because the explicature ‚Äî at the time of utterance, Jim and Raoul had passed Chicago and were not yet there (supplement: in Seattle) ‚Äî was true. Definition Explicature was introduced by Sperber and Wilson as a concept in relevance theory. Carston gives a formal definition in accord with their reasoning: > [An explicature is an] ostensively communicated assumption that is > inferentially developed from one of the incomplete conceptual > representations (logical forms) encoded by the utterance. Thus, only meanings of an utterance that are communicated can be explicatures. Information that can be inferred, but was not intended to be inferred by the communicator, is neither an explicature nor an implicature. Conversely, something that is communicated but not believed by the addressee is an explicature, as the responsibility for explicatures lies with the communicator. Developing explicatures The definition also implies that the logical form (intuitively, the literal meaning) of an utterance is incomplete. In order to turn it into a complete proposition that is either true or false, enough context must be known to be able to infer additional information: to * assign referents to indexical expressions (such as proper names and pronouns), * disambiguate ambiguous expressions, * \\"enrich\\" logical forms containing words and grammatical structures that are semantically or grammatically incomplete (e.g. genitive constructions, the degree adverb \\"too\\", or ellipses). For example, if Peter says \\"Susan told me that her kiwis were too sour\\", the hearer has to determine which Susan he is referring to, whether \\"her\\" refers to Susan, whether \\"kiwis\\" means the fruit or the birds, in what relation the kiwis stand to her, and by what standard they were too sour. The hearer bases his decisions on the concept of relevance, which basically says that the resulting interpretation should have many effects on his knowledge and beliefs at a low cost for his speech processing system. So, depending on the context, the first explicature of the utterance might be one of the following: : (1a) Peter has said that Susan told him that the kiwifruit she, Susan, ate were too sour for her taste. : (1b) Peter has said that Susan told him that the kiwifruit she, Susan, grew were too sour for the judges at the fruit grower‚Äôs contest. Let us assume it follows from context that (1a) is the correct explicature. Now if Peter is speaking literally (as opposed to, say, ironically), the utterance also communicates : (2) Peter believes that Susan told him that the kiwifruit she ate were too sour for her taste. If Peter has reason to think that his utterance will convince the hearer, it further communicates : (3) Susan told Peter that the kiwifruit she ate were too sour for her taste. This is called the basic explicature of the utterance, while (1a), (1b) and (2) are higher-level explicatures. Explicature (2) communicates a propositional attitude of the speaker, namely that he believes the proposition expressed by the utterance. Additional attitudes can be expressed by further higher-level explicatures, for example : (4a) Peter is annoyed that Susan told him that the kiwifruit she ate were too sour for her taste. : (4b) Peter is bewildered that Susan told him that the kiwifruit she ate were too sour for her taste. or, if the statement is ironic, : (5) It is ridiculous to say that Susan told Peter that the kiwifruit she ate were too sour for her taste. The speaker can give the addressee various linguistic cues to indicate propositional attitudes, such as grammatical mood, and paralinguistic cues, such as tone of voice. Often such cues do not determine the attitude, and the addressee again has to take the context into account. Regarding grammatical mood, the first higher-level explicature of an imperative utterance is \\"The speaker is telling the hearer to ‚Ä¶\\". Depending on other cues and context, further explicatures could be \\"The speaker is ordering the hearer to ‚Ä¶\\", \\"It is moderately desirable to the speaker that ‚Ä¶\\", or \\"It would be desirable to the hearer that ‚Ä¶\\", as in this example: : (6) A: Could you tell me the way to the station? :: B: Turn right at the traffic lights and keep straight on. (explicature: I would be desirable to A to turn right at the traffic lights and keep straight on.) The first higher-level explicature of a question is \\"The speaker is asking whether/what/who ‚Ä¶\\". Neither imperatives nor questions have a basic explicature in the above sense. Inferences that aren't logically compelling are defeasible: they can be \\"defeated\\" (cancelled) by explicit information without sounding self-contradictory. Thus Peter could cancel much of the above by continuing the original sentence with \\"Susan made the birds Chinese style, sweet-sour, but used way too much lime juice for my taste.\\" Disputed cases=Expansion Is France hexagonal? Often an utterance that already is a complete proposition needs further expansion to arrive at the proposition the communicator intended to convey. This can involve * adding missing constituents (This is a difficult task ‚Üí for me / for a schoolchild / for the scientific community), * specifying the scope of certain elements such as negators (Everyone isn't hungry ‚Üí Not everyone is hungry or No one is hungry), * strengthening of expressions (This will take time ‚Üí This will take more time than you might expect; I have had breakfast ‚Üí I have had breakfast today; He drank a bottle of vodka and fell into a stupor ‚Üí He drank a bottle of vodka and consequently fell into a stupor; Mr Prescott is busy ‚Üí Mr Prescott is so busy that he cannot see you), * weakening of expressions (France is hexagonal ‚Üí France is approximately hexagonal; The room was silent ‚Üí The room was nearly silent) There is little consensus which of these, if any, is part of what is explicitly said, i.e. which are explicatures. Carston has argued that an utterance's implicatures cannot entail any of its explicatures; hence, the above should be explicatures. Another test for explicatures is that they can be embedded in negations and if clauses, which is supposedly impossible for implicatures. However, neither of these tests is generally accepted. Impliciture Kent Bach has argued against viewing enrichment as a form of explicature. He has coined the term implic _i_ ture to refer to completions of the logical form to a proposition, minus assignment of referents and disambiguation, and also to expansions in the above sense. This is to distinguish what is explicitly said in a narrow sense, i.e. the literal meaning, from what goes beyond the linguistic material actually present in the sentence. Metaphor and other figures of speech Relevance theory originally described loose talk, hyperbole, metaphor, and other figures of speech as conveying information solely via implicatures. The argument goes that a metaphorical utterance such as \\"Your room is a pigsty\\" would have the basic explicature \\"Your room is an enclosure where pigs are kept\\", but that cannot be an explicature at all because it is certainly not communicated. What is actually communicated, approximately \\"Your room is very filthy and untidy\\", must therefore be an implicature. Carston noted that the mentioned embedding tests classify metaphors and other figures of speech as explicatures, not implicatures. To resolve this issue, she has proposed that the meaning of words and phrases is adapted depending on the circumstances of an utterance. Thus, \\"pigsty\\" acquires the sense \\"a very filthy and untidy place\\", so that the meaning of the utterance can be accommodated by an explicature.

According to some sources the monastery was built in the end of the 4th century and the beginning of the 5th century. In 989 and 1845 the monastery was reconstructed. The monastery rose during the reign of bishop Gabriel Harutunyan. During his reign, many people from near villages help monastery. The new rose of monastery was during the reign of Stepanos Balyants, in the 1830s. It is known that in 1839, monk Grigor Ter- Hovhannesyants three times served as a priest. In 1849 archimandrite Sargis had followed archimandrite Hovhannes. In northeast of the monastery is located a vaulted barn.

The hall is located north of the church, which probably served as a place of worship - sacristy.  The cells  At 5 meters to the east of the church, there are cells of the monks, looking west. The cells are 6 vaulted rooms, each has an entrance and a window looking west. To the south-east of cells from north to south stretches dining. From the south to the dining room adjoins a similar room, most likely served as a kitchen. The cells of the monks built in the same style as the whole church, were built in 1630 from.

He grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, where he began his artistic career as a professional stage actor, and is a graduate of Rhode Island School of Design. Langan's films typically involve technical experimentation, particularly the manipulation of time. Surreal sequences appear frequently in his films. He is known for his use of the experimental animation technique, pixilation, and his adaptation of the historical photographic technique, chronophotography. His artistic influences include singer/composer Bobby McFerrin and filmmakers Norman McLaren, Zbigniew Rybczy≈Ñski, Steven X. Arthur, and Jan ≈†vankmajer. Notable awards include a Student Academy Award nomination, Most Promising Filmmaker at Ann Arbor Film Festival, and Best Experimental Short at Slamdance Film Festival. Short Films Langan's first student film, Snail, premiered at Ann Arbor Film Festival in March 2007. His undergraduate thesis film, Doxology, has received widespread acclaim, winning fourteen awards at over eighty film festivals worldwide. Slamdance Film Festival commissioned Langan to complete a short film in 2008. The resulting film, Dahlia, which premiered at the festival the following year, has since screened at film festivals around the world and appeared on Showtime. The film is a three-minute portrait of San Francisco, Langan's home at the time, featuring a musical score composed by the filmmaker. In 2010, Langan collaborated with author Brian Christian on a short film adaptation of Christian's poem, Heliotropes. The film was featured at twenty film festivals in 2011 and premiered online with The Atlantic on September 1, 2011. Heliotropes later appeared in the final edition of Wholphin (DVD) in February 2012. Langan collaborated with Harvard lecturer Terah Maher on the 2011 dance film, Choros, building on the chronophotography work of Eadweard Muybridge, Etienne Jules Marey, and Norman McLaren. The film is scored with the 1976 composition Music for 18 Musicians by minimalist composer Steve Reich. Langan returned to pixilation with his 2013 short film, Butler, Woman, Man (L'homme, la femme et le majordome), a French co-production of Paprika Films and Arte. The film premiered on French and German television broadcast in March, 2013. Music videos In March 2014, Skrillex's OWSLA record label released Hundred Waters - Cavity, a music video for the single by indie band Hundred Waters, directed by Michael Langan. The music video was premiered by NPR's Jacob Ganz, and subsequently covered by Pitchfork Media and The Huffington Post.

Yoji Yamada was also nominated for Best Director for these two films. Stuart Galbraith IV writes that Stage-Struck Tora-san is one of the weaker entries in the Otoko wa Tsurai yo series. He notes that co-star Tetsuya Takeda, a popular comic actor in Japan at the time, comes across as hammy in western eyes. According to Galbraith, the film works best as a nostalgic look at late-1970s popular culture. The opening dream segment is a spoof of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), and there are references to Pink Lady as well as glimpses into Japan's economic situation of the era. The German-language site molodezhnaja gives Stage-Struck Tora-san three out of five stars. Availability Stage-Struck Tora-san was released theatrically on August 5, 1978.

M√°laga's Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Telmo (\\"San Telmo Royal Academy of Fine Arts\\") had long wished to create such and institution. The Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes was founded 3 February 1915 and opened its doors in a temporary location in the Calle Pedro de Toledo 17 August 1916.

The latter came from digs that had occurred in the province since the 1930s, including digs in the Alcazaba of M√°laga, where the new museum opened in 1949. In 1996, rehabilitation of the Alcazaba required a move. The collection was temporarily housed in the 16th-century Convento de la Trinidad until 1999, when it moved to the former provincial historical archive in the Avenida de Europa, which it shares with the Biblioteca P√∫blica del Estado (\\"State Public Library\\").

History Formally, the Department of Chemistry has been created as a separate entity of Saint Petersburg State University (then Leningrad State University) in 1929. However, the history of chemistry at Saint Petersburg State University began much earlier. First chemistry laboratory and lectures in chemistry were introduced at the University in 1833. One of the first professors of chemistry was Alexander Voskresensky, a doctoral student of Justus von Liebig. Voskresensky largely contributed to the growth of chemistry classes at the University. He initiated lectures in organic chemistry (1843) and promoted first scientific projects. Later, in 1868, the chemistry division hosted then by the Department of Physics and Mathematics was split into three to form the division of organic chemistry led by Aleksandr Butlerov, the division of inorganic chemistry led by Dmitri Mendeleev and the division of analytical chemistry led by Nikolai Menshutkin. Since then, the University of Saint-Petersburg became home to one of the most elite chemistry schools in the country. Many prominent Russian chemists began their career and/or worked there. Among them are Nikolay Zinin, Alexey Favorsky, Lev Aleksandrovich Chugaev, Dmitry Konovalov, Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev, Vyacheslav Tishchenko, Vladimir Ipatieff, Nikolay Semyonov, Boris Nikolsky, Mikhail Shultz. In the Soviet era, the Department of Chemistry continued to grow with new divisions: colloid chemistry (1939), electrochemistry (1940), chemistry of macromolecular compounds (1944), radiochemistry (1945), physical organic chemistry (1946), theory of solutions (1950), chemistry of natural compounds (1963), quantum chemistry (1967), solid state chemistry (1978). Campuses Historically, some of the first chemistry offices were located in the main building of Saint Petersburg State University called Twelve Collegia. The remainder of these is the Mendeleev museum located on the first floor of the central part of this enormous building. In the 20th century, the Department of Chemistry was headquartered at 41/43 Sredniy prospekt on Vasilievsky Island, about one mile west of Twelve Collegia.

Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on June 2, 1951, and stars Tweety and Sylvester the Cat. This is one of five Warner Bros. Cartoons that had Music Scores provided by Eugene Poddany in the early 1950‚Äôs, as the studios regular Musical Director, Carl Stalling, was recovering from a brain injury during the cartoons production. Milt Franklyn was also credited for Orchestrations. Plot Two elderly ladies (one of which is Granny), the owners of Sylvester and Tweety, sneak their pets into a hotel where no pets are allowed. Sylvester, hearing Tweety's singing in the room next to his, writes a letter to the canary from his \\"Ardent Admirer\\". Tweety shortly discovers who his \\"admirer\\" is, and a chase ensues, which is cut short by the doorman, forcing both Tweety and Sylvester to run back into their rooms and the latter to disguise himself (as a lady in bed screaming for help from the policemen) causing the doorman after he entered his room without knocking to apologize and flee. Sylvester then sneaks into Tweety's room and tries to get him in his cage; this backfires and he is knocked out by the spring-loaded cage and is dragged back to his room by Tweety. Sylvester then phones Tweety that his owner has a surprise for him; Tweety goes downstairs to receive it, but instead goes down Sylvester's throat, returning with a mouse from the time of Thomas Jefferson, explaining he is dead. The chase then goes outside, and into the room of Hector (how his owner got him past the doorman is unknown). Sylvester doesn't realize until after he's captured Tweety again that the dog is there. Another chase ensues, involving dog, cat and bird, which is also cut short by the doorman, forcing the three to form a truce long enough to disguise themselves (as an angry old lady with Tweety's head). The chase resumes again with the three animals running from room to room, making the doorman suspicious. Finally, cat, dog, and bird noises are heard behind a door (or he sees the trio off-screen), prompting the frustrated doorman to finally head back to the lobby and make an announcement over the intercom evicting all pets. Unfortunately for him, a veritable zoo calls the hotel home, and comes stampeding over him. Getting up, the doorman dizzily says Tweety's catch phrase: \\"I tawt I taw a putty tat!\\" Tweety, popping out of hiding, delivers the final punchline by replying, \\"You did! You did! You taw a putty tat, a moo-moo tow, a big dowiwwa, a diddy-up hortey, and a wittle monkey!\\" (A busker's monkey was the last animal to run over the doorman) ReferencesExternal links * Category:Short films directed by Friz Freleng Category:Films set in hotels Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:American films Category:1951 animated films Category:1950s American animated films Category:1951 films Category:American animated short films Category:Animated films about cats Category:Animated films about birds Category:Animated films about dogs Category:Warner Bros. animated short films, 1950s ","title":"Room and Bird"},{"id":"25858529","text":"You might be looking for: * Pure (programming language) * Language purism * Adamic language ","title":"Pure (language)"},{"id":"25858615","text":"Rodger Dean Duncan (born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma) is an American author and business consultant whose focus is leadership, human performance, and the strategic management of change.

Growing up, Cho recounted that life was financially difficult as an undocumented immigrant, stating, \\"My parents left for work before I woke up and came back home after I went to sleep. We had financial difficulties and there were times when we had no water or electricity for a few days because we weren't able to pay the bills. Other daily activities that others take for granted such as having a drivers‚Äô license was difficult for my father\\". Due to a display of skill in speed skating, his parents sold their business and spent their savings to move to Salt Lake City to train Cho for the sport after he graduated from junior high school. Simon Cho now resides in Rockville, Maryland and when he is not coaching, he enjoys watching sports, documentaries and attending concerts. Career Cho began skating at the age of 3. He trained in Salt Lake City but moved back to Upper Marlboro, Maryland a year before the U.S. Olympic Trials, initially quit speed skating after failing to qualify for performance grants from the U.S. Olympic Committee and U.S. Speedskating which would have offset the unaffordable costs of $40,000 for training. About his chances of making the Olympic team, Cho said, \\"When I say nobody thought I would make the team, literally nobody thought I would make it...Not even me\\". However, at the age of 18, Cho qualified for the 2010 U.S. Olympic team. Apolo Ohno noted that Cho \\"basically made this team training on his own\\". Cho cites Ohno and Shani Davis as mentors who helped him face challenges as being a person of color in the sport. At the Vancouver Olympics, he competed in the 500 meter and 5000 meter relay events. Cho earned a bronze medal in the relay after skating in the semifinals. In August 27, 2013, Cho received a two-year suspension from competitions after he admitted having sabotaged his Canadian rival's Olivier Jean's equipment during the 2011 World Team Championships. Cho claimed that he acted on an order from his coach Jae-Su Chun. The suspension ran through October 4, 2014, which means Cho missed the chance to qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. He is now the coach of his home club, the Potomac Speedskating Club, now based in Wheaton, MD.http://www.potomacspeedskating.org/coaching/ ReferencesExternal links * ISU profile * Simon Cho at the United States Olympic Committee * * http://www.potomacspeedskating.org Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:American male short track speed skaters Category:Olympic short track speed skaters of the United States Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States in short track speed skating Category:Short track speed skaters at the 2010 Winter Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2010 Winter Olympics Category:American sportspeople of Korean descent Category:South Korean emigrants to the United States Category:World Short Track Speed Skating Championships medalists Category:Undocumented immigrants to the United States ","title":"Simon Cho"},{"id":"25858806","text":"Lodewijk Petrus Alfons, Baron Campo (25 December 1926 ‚Äì 29 July 2009) was a Belgian business executive.

The reticle image in this sight is produced by an optical collimator bounced off a beam splitter. The dot remains on the target even though the viewer's head is moved side to side A reflector sight or reflex sight is an optical device that allows the user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an aiming point or some other image superimposed on the field of view. These sights work on the simple optical principle that anything at the focus of a lens or curved mirror (such as an illuminated reticle) will appear to be sitting in front of the viewer at infinity. Reflector sights employ some sort of \\"reflector\\" to allow the viewer to see the infinity image and the field of view at the same time, either by bouncing the image created by lens off a slanted glass plate, or by using a mostly clear curved glass reflector that images the reticle while the viewer looks through the reflector. Since the reticle is at infinity it stays in alignment with the device the sight is attached to regardless of the viewer's eye position, removing most of the parallax and other sighting errors found in simple sighting devices. Since their invention in 1900, reflector sights have come to be used as gun sights on all kinds of weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited capacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base component in many types of modern head-up displays. They have been used in other types of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft gun sights, anti tank gun sights, and any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view, and the sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight, with a red light-emitting diode (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time. Reflector sights are also used in civilian applications such as sights on surveying equipment, optical telescope pointing aids, and camera viewfinders.  Design  Diagram of three types of reflector sights. The top uses a collimating lens (CL) and a beam splitter (B) to create a virtual image at infinity (V) of a reticle (R). The bottom two use half silvered curved mirrors (CM) as the collimating optics Reflector sights work by using a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a luminous or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at the focus of the collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.American rifleman: Volume 93, National Rifle Association of America - THE REFLECTOR SIGHT By JOHN B. BUTLER, page 31 A common type (used in applications such as aircraft gun sights) uses a collimating lens and a beam splitter. This type tends to be bulky since it requires at least two optical components, the lens and the beam splitter/glass plate. The reticle collimation optics are situated at 90¬∞ to the optical path making lighting difficult, usually needing additional electric illumination, condensing lenses, etc. A more compact type replaces the lens/beam splitter configuration with a half silvered or dichroic curved collimating mirror set at an angle that performs both tasks of focusing and combining the image of an offset reticle. This type is most often seen as the red dot type used on small arms. It is also possible to place the reticle between the viewer and the curved mirror at the mirror's focus. The reticle itself is too close to the eye to be in focus but the curved mirror presents the viewer with an image of the reticle at infinity. This type was invented by Dutch optical engineer Lieuwe Van Albada in 1932, originally as a camera viewfinder, and was also used as a gunsight on World War II bazookas: the US M9 and M9A1 \\"Bazooka\\" featured the D7161556 folding \\"Reflecting Sight Assembly\\". The viewing portion of a reflector sight does not use any refractive optical elements, it is simply a projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A reflector sight also does not have the field of view and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of eye relief. Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief. The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.American rifleman: Volume 93, National Rifle Association of America - THE REFLECTOR SIGHT By JOHN B. BUTLER, page 29  History  1901 diagram of a version of Howard Grubb's collimating reflector sight designed to make a compact version suitable for firearms and small devices. Ambient lighting of the reticle was improved by placing it facing up and bouncing it off a relay mirror then off a concave collimating mirror The idea of a reflector sight originated in 1900 with Irish optical designer and telescope maker Howard Grubb in patent No.12108. Grubb conceived of his \\"Gun Sight for large and small Ordnance\\" as a better alternative to the difficult to use iron sight while avoiding the telescopic sight's limited field of view, greater apparent target speed, parallax errors, and the danger of keeping the eye against an eye stop. In the 1901 the Scientific Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society he described his invention as: Prototype of the Grubb reflector sight attached to a rifle It was noted soon after its invention that the sight could be a good alternative to iron sights and also had uses in surveying and measuring equipment. The reflector sight was first used on German fighter aircraft in 1918British Aircraft Armament Vol.2: Guns and Gunsights\\", by R Wallace Clarke, page 134 and widely adopted on all kinds of fighter and bomber aircraft in the 1930s. By World War II the reflector sight was being used on many types of weapons besides aircraft, including anti-aircraft guns, naval guns, anti-tank weapons, and many other weapons where the user needed the simplicity and quick target acquisition nature of the sight. Through its development in the 1930s and into World War II the sight was also being referred to in some applications by the abbreviation \\"reflex sight\\".Applied physics Chauncey Guy Suits, George Russell Harrison, Louis Jordan - 1948, page 222 - \\"One of the most important types of gun sights used by the Army and Navy during the war was the reflex, or reflector, sight.\\"  Weapon sights  FlaK 38 anti- aircraft gun (1944), one of the more sophisticated sights at the time Reflector sights were invented as an improved gun-sight and since their invention they have been adapted to many types of weapons. When used with different types of guns, reflector sights are considered an improvement over simple iron sights (sights composed of two spaced metal aiming points that have to be aligned).Applied optics and optical engineering, Volume 5, Part 2 - Page 198 Rudolf Kingslake, Robert Rennie Shannon, James C. Wyant Applied optics and optical engineering, Volume 5, Part 2 - Page 198 Iron sights take considerable experience and skill in the user who has to hold a proper eye position and focus exclusively on the front sight, keeping it centered on the (unfocused) rear sight, while keeping the whole centered on a target at different distances, requiring alignment of all three planes of focus to achieve a hit.Transactions, Volume 23 By Institution of Mining Engineers (Great Britain), Federated Institution of Mining Engineers, page 125 The reflector sight's single, parallax-free virtual image, in focus with the target, removes this aiming problem, helping poor, average, and expert shooters alike. Since the collimated image produced by the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to the diameter of the collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle in the middle of the optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards). Compared to standard telescopic sights, a reflector sight can be held at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting the image of the target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically- convenient mounting position on a weapon.  Aircraft  Longitudinal cross- section of a basic reflector sight for pre-WWII German fighter planes (1937 German Revi C12/A) The earliest record of the reflector sight being used with fighter aircraft was in 1918. The optical firm of Optische Anstalt Oigee of Berlin, working from the Grubb patents, developed two versions what came to be known as the Oigee Reflector Sight. Both used a 45 degree angle glass beam splitter and electrical illumination and were used to aim the plane's machine guns. One version was used in operational trials on the biplane Albatros D.Va and triplane Fokker Dr.1 fighters. There was some interest in this sight after World War I but reflector sights in general were not widely adopted for fighter and bomber aircraft until the 1930s, first by the French, then by most other major airforces. These sights were not only used for aiming fighter aircraft, they were used with aircraft defensive guns and in bombsights. Reflector sights as aircraft gun-sights have many advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely as they did in two-point mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator, mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens. The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting. HUD inside the cockpit of a fighter jet The optical nature of the reflector sight meant it was possible to feed other information into field of view, such as modifications of the aiming point due to deflection determined by input from a gyroscope.Lon O. Nordeen, Air warfare in the missile age, page 265 1939 saw the development by the British of the first of these gyro gunsights, reflector sights adjusted by gyroscope for the aircraft's speed and rate of turn, enabling the display of a lead-adjusted sighting reticle that lagged the actual \\"boresight\\" of the weapon(s), allowing the boresight to lead the target in a turn by the proper amount for an effective strike As reflector sight designs advanced after World War II, giving the pilot more and more information, they eventually evolved into the head-up display (HUD). The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at the focus of the collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and airspeed indicators), facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.  Firearms  A US Marine looking through an ITL MARS reflex sight on his M16A4 rifle The idea of attaching a reflector sight to a firearm has been around since its invention in 1900. Soon after World War II models appeared for rifles and shotguns including the Nydar shotgun sight (1945),Game breeder and sportsman: Volumes 50-52, 1945 which used a curved semi-reflective mirror to reflect an ambient lit reticle, and the Giese electric gunsight (1947), which had a battery-powered illuminated reticle.\\"Stock Up For the Outdoors\\", Popular Science - Dec 1946- Vol. 149, No. 6 - page 150 Later types included the Qwik-Point (1970) and the Thompson Insta-Sight. Both were beam-splitter type reflector sights that used ambient light: illuminating a green crosshair in the Insta-Sight, and a red plastic rod \\"light pipe\\" that produced a red aiming spot reticle in the Qwik- Point.Popular Science - Sep 1971 - Page 56 A view through a Tasco ProPoint red dot sight The mid- to late 1970s saw the introduction of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point.Invention intelligence: Volume 11, Inventions Promotion Board, National Research Development Corporation of India, 1976, page 12 The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light-emitting diode (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight: there is no need for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours. Reflector sights for military firearms (usually referred to as reflex sights) took a long time to be adopted. The US House Committee on Armed Services noted as far back as 1975 on the suitability of the use of reflex sight for the M16 rifle,\\"Hearings before and special reports made by Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives on subjects affecting the naval and military establishments\\", Volume 980 - Page 3002 United States. Congress. House. Committee on Armed Services - Political Science, 1975 but the US military did not widely introduce reflector sights until the early 2000s with the Aimpoint CompM2 red dot sight, designated the \\"M68 Close Combat Optic\\". = Reticle types = Many reticle illumination and pattern options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights are specifically designed to be visible when viewed through night vision devices. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns. Sights that use dot reticles are almost invariably measured in minutes of arc, sometimes called \\"minutes of angle\\" or \\"moa\\". Moa is a convenient measure for shooters using [Imperial or US customary units, since 1 moa subtends approximately at a distance of , which makes moa a convenient unit to use in ballistics calculations. A 5 moa (1.5 milliradian) dot is small enough not to obscure most targets, and large enough to quickly acquire a proper \\"sight picture\\". For many types of action shooting, a larger dot has traditionally been preferred; 7, 10, 15 or even 20 moa (2, 3, 4.5 or 6 mil) have been used; often these will be combined with horizontal and/or vertical lines to provide a level reference. Most sights have either active or passive adjustments for the reticle brightness, which help the shooter adapt to different lighting conditions. A very dim reticle will help prevent loss of night vision in low-light conditions, while a brighter reticle will display more clearly in full sunlight. = Configurations = Modern optical reflector sights designed for firearms and other uses fall into two housing- configurations: \\"tubed\\" and \\"open\\". * Tube sights look similar to standard telescopic sights, with a cylindrical tube containing the optics. Many tube sights offer the option of interchangeable filters (such as polarizing or haze-reducing filters), glare-reducing sunshades, and conveniently protective \\"flip-up\\" lens covers. * Open sights (also known as \\"mini reflex sights\\" and \\"mini red dots\\") take advantage of the fact that the reflector sight's only optical element, the optical window, doesn't need any housing at all. This configuration consists of a base with just the necessary reflective surface for collimating the reticle mounted on it. Due to their diminished profile, open sights do not usually accommodate filters and other accessory options typically supported by tube designs.  Other uses  The Telrad, a reflector sight for astronomical telescopes introduced in the late 1970s Reflector sights have been used over the years in nautical navigation devices and surveying equipment. Albada type sights were used on early large format cameras, \\"Point and shoot\\" type cameras, and on simple disposable cameras. These sights are also used on astronomical telescopes as finderscopes, to help aim the telescope at the desired object. There are many commercial models, the first of which was the Telrad, invented by amateur astronomer Steve Kufeld in the late 1970s. Others are now available from companies such as Apogee, Celestron, Photon, Rigel, and Televue. Reflector sights are also used in the entertainment industry in productions such as live theater on \\"Follow Spot\\" spotlights. Sights such as Telrad's adapted for use and the purpose built Spot DotLighting dimensions, Volume 19, Page 114, Lighting Dimensions Associates, 1995 allow the spotlight operator to aim the light without turning it on.  Similar types  * Collimator sights (also called collimatingWilliam C Farmer, Ordnance field guide, page 279 or \\"occluded eye gunsight\\" (OEG))Jan Kay, International Defense Directory, 1991-92, page 241 are simply the optical collimator focusing a reticle without any optical window. The viewer cannot see through them and only sees an image of the reticle. They are used either with both eyes open while one looks into the sight, with one eye open and moving the head to alternately see the sight and then at the target, or using one eye to partially see the sight and target at the same time. The reticle is illuminated by an electric, radioluminescent or passive ambient light source. The Armson OEG and the Normark Corp. Singlepoint are two examples of commercially available ambient lit collimator sights. These sights have the advantage of requiring less illumination for the reticle for the same level of usability, due to the high contrast black background behind the reticle. For this reason occluded eye gunsights were more practical for use on small arms before low power consumption illumination sources such as LEDs became commonplace. * Holographic weapon sights are similar in layout to reflector sights but do not use a projected reticle system. Instead, a representative reticle is recorded in three-dimensional space onto holographic film at the time of manufacture. This image is part of the optical viewing window. The recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated laser built into the sight. The sight can be adjusted for range and windage by simply tilting or pivoting the optical window.

These spiders have been known to grow in excess of 9 inches (23 cm) across. The legs are an intense blue with a brown or gold carapace. The male is usually not as vibrant, the species exhibiting sexual dimorphism. The generic placement of the species has been questioned, and specimens identified as males of this species may actually be from a different species. Taxonomy Omothymus violaceopes was first described by H. C. Abraham in 1924, under the name Lampropelma violaceopedes. However, specific names under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature cannot be plural, so violaceopedes was corrected to violaceopes. In August 2019, the species was transferred to the genus Omothymus.  Food  Diet consists primarily of large beetles, cockroaches, large crickets, mantids, and other large arthropods. Occasionally, young mice, birds and other small vertebrates are taken. During feeding, the abdomen (opisthosoma) will often increase its size two-fold.  In captivity  Singapore blues are commonly kept as pets because of their beautiful colours. Caution should be taken, as Singapore blues are a relatively aggressive species and tend to bite as the first line of defense. Recommended feeding includes four to six live crickets every few weeks. Gut loading, or providing prey with vitamins and other nutrients, provides tarantulas with a healthy meal. Uneaten prey should be removed after one day. Fasting, or not eating, for days or weeks at a time is sometimes an indication of an upcoming moult.

He was a professor at Sayre Female Institute in Lexington, Kentucky for 35 years after the war. Early life Henry Brainerd McClellan was born at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on October 17, 1840.Krick, Robert E. L. Staff Officers in Gray: A Biographical Register of the Staff Officers in the Army of Northern Virginia. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003. . p. 206.Trout, Robert J. They Followed the Plume: The Story of J.E.B. Stuart and His Staff. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 1993. . p. 200. His family had come from Connecticut where his great- grandfather, Samuel McClellan, was a general of Connecticut troops in the American Revolutionary War. He was a son of surgeon and oculist Samuel McClellan. He had four brothers who fought for the Union during the Civil War.Wittenberg, Eric J., and J. David Petruzzi. Plenty of Blame to Go Around: Jeb Stuart's Controversial Ride to Gettysburg. New York: Savas Beatie, 2006. . p. 8. One of them, Carswell (born 1836) was a lieutenant and assistant adjutant general to Union Army Major General Andrew A. Humphreys. Henry was a first cousin of Union Major General George B. McClellan, who twice commanded the Army of the Potomac. After studying for the ministry at Williams College, from which he graduated in 1858 aged 17, McClellan moved to Stony Point Mills in Cumberland County, Virginia where he became a schoolteacher. Henry McClellan married Catherine Macon Matthews of Cumberland County, Virginia on December 12, 1863.Trout, 1993, p. 203. They had nine children, although only five survived Henry. American Civil War service Shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War, on June 14, 1861, Henry McClellan enlisted in Company G, 3rd Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment in Ashland, Virginia.Trout, 1993, p. 201. He became a lieutenant and adjutant general of the regiment on May 18, 1862. McClellan was promoted to major on April 15, 1863 and on May 2, 1863 was appointed adjutant-general to Major General J.E.B. Stuart after the death of Stuart's previous adjutant general, Channing Price, at the Battle of Chancellorsville.* Wert, Jeffry D. Cavalryman of the Lost Cause: A Biography of J.E.B. Stuart. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2008. . p. 221. On June 9, 1863, McClellan's quick action as Stuart went to another part of the field helped the Confederates save the key position of Fleetwood Hill at the Battle of Brandy Station, Virginia.Trout, 1993, p. 202. After the surprise appearance of a large Union force near Brandy Station in the early morning Stuart left McClellan and a few others, mainly couriers, at Fleetwood Hill while he went to organize and lead his forces.Wert, 2008, p. 242. As the battle progressed, Union troops led by the 1st New Jersey Cavalry began to climb Fleetwood Hill.Wert, 2008, p. 247. McClellan ordered the crew of the sole available artillery piece, commanded by Lieutenant John W. Carter, to fire their last few shells of ammunition, which had been set aside as defective, to stall the approaching Union regiment. The New Jersey cavalrymen held back long enough to allow the 12th Virginia Cavalry Regiment to charge over the top of the hill and engage them. Additional regiments from both armies joined the fight for the hill and Stuart brought up more artillery pieces.Wert, 2008, pp. 247-248. Eventually the Confederates secured possession of the hill.Wert, 2008, p. 248. As Stuart's chief of staff, McClellan accompanied and greatly assisted Stuart during the Gettysburg Campaign. Soon after the start of the Stuart's ride around the Union Army of the Potomac, McClellan, other staff officers Andrew Reid Venable, Jr. and John Esten Cooke and a courier, were eating breakfast at the home of a blacksmith while the blacksmith shoed their horses. The Confederate officers were about a half mile from the main body of Brigadier General Wade Hampton III's cavalry division when advance riders from the 11th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry rode by in pursuit of the advance guard of Hampton's division during the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1863). McClellan, Venables and the courier quickly fled toward their main body but Cooke was intent on finishing his breakfast and having his horse shoed. He barely escaped when a second group of Union riders became suspicious of the nature of activity at the farm and rode up to check.Wittenberg, 2006, p. 11. In the winter of 1863-1864, one of Henry's brothers, a captain on the staff of Union Major General George Meade, passed through the lines near Orange Court House, Virginia so that they might commiserate upon the death of a sister in Philadelphia.Trout, 1993, pp. 197-200. When Stuart was mortally wounded at the Battle of Yellow Tavern, Virginia on May 11, 1864, he passed command to Major General Fitzhugh Lee and ordered McClellan to assist Lee while other staff members accompanied him on list last journey to Richmond.Wert, 2008, p. 358. After the battle, McClellan traveled to Stuart's bedside and was there when he died. Stuart gave his bay horse to McClellan and asked him to perform a few final tasks, showing his feelings and trust in his adjutant. After Stuart‚Äôs death, McClellan served for three months on the staff of General Robert E. Lee. On August 11, 1864, he was appointed major and assistant adjutant general to Major General Wade Hampton III Henry McClellan was paroled at Greensboro, North Carolina on April 26, 1865. Post-war McClellan was in Cumberland County for three years after the war but sources do not show what work he did during this time.Trout, 1993, p. 204. In 1869, McClellan moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where he accepted a position at Sayre Female Institute as a professor. He became principal in 1870. He was a professor at Sayre until his death in 1904. He also was active in Confederate veteran activities. In 1885, Henry McClellan published The Life and Campaigns of Major General J. E. B. Stuart. Henry Brainerd McClellan died of a stroke in Lexington, Kentucky. He is buried in Lexington Cemetery at Lexington, Kentucky. NotesReferences * Krick, Robert E. L.

The Tale of Zatoichi Continues is the second entry in the popular, long-running Zatoichi series. Plot One year after the first film, Zat≈çichi travels back to the town near the Joshoji Temple, to pay respects at the grave of Hirate, the samurai he killed. Three brigands attack Zat≈çichi while he dries his clothes, and are despatched by a one-armed swordsman. Later that day, Zat≈çichi is hired to massage a powerful lord who, unbeknownst to all but the lord's highest retainers, is insane. Zat≈çichi observes the nobleman's unstable mental condition, and the retainers decide to kill him. Zat≈çichi defeats the first three attackers, and retires to a restaurant. The attack having failed, the lord's men hire local yakuza (gangsters) to finish the job. Learning of this, Zatoichi remarks to himself that he would have kept quiet if they had just asked him to do so. Three prostitutes in the restaurant discuss how many men are now looking for Zat≈çichi, and how they will have no business. One of them, Setsu, grows very fond of Zat≈çichi very quickly, asking him to spend the night with her, and saying that her own father was blind and yet married three women. While Zat≈çichi sits in a back room the one-armed swordsman, Yoshiro, and his companion enter the same restaurant. The companion remarks how Setsu looks exactly like Chiyo, a woman Yoshiro once loved. Yoshiro demands that Setsu spend the night with him. Setsu refuses, and Zat≈çichi re-enters the room. Yoshiro tells a short story of how Chiyo left him after he became a cripple. Zat≈çichi says that he too loved a woman named Chiyo but that she, upon discovering he was blind, left him for the man she hated most in the world. In his rage, Zat≈çichi says, he sought out this man and attacked him. Zat≈çichi leaves with Setsu. In the morning, she remarks that it is as if they were married. Learning that he is to be killed, she urges Zat≈çichi to leave, but he awaits the attackers. Sukegoro, the yakuza boss with whom Yoshiro has been staying, returns from his travels, having learned that Yoshiro is a wanted criminal, only posing as a samurai. He confronts Yoshiro and tells him it is time for him to leave. Yoshiro, on his way out of town, hears that Zat≈çichi is planning on going to the temple to pay respects. He decides to go there too, but he is followed and the constabulary are alerted. Otane, who is to be married, hears of Zat≈çichi's return, and races to the temple, too. On his own way to the temple, Zat≈çichi stops by the stream where he once fished with Hirate (in the previous film), and laments the loss of the only man he could call friend. He also regrets his failure to understand Otane's desire to marry him (also in the previous film), and recalls his love for Chiyo, who was stolen from him by his brother: Yoshiro. At the temple, Otane meets Zat≈çichi. Yoshiro arrives and says he wants to kill his younger brother in revenge for crippling him. Zat≈çichi questions the necessity of this, since Yoshiro has already stolen Chiyo from him. Yoshiro responds that he has killed Chiyo. Yoshiro disarms Zat≈çichi but the latter stabs him with his own wakizashi. The constabulary arrive and Zat≈çichi flees with the stricken Yoshiro. Otane brings food to them in hiding, and overhears Zat≈çichi saying that he is happy Otane is getting married, and hopes she is happy in her life. Despite Zatoichi's care, Yoshiro dies, but only after revealing that Chiyo is not dead: she left him, he says, after he became crippled, and he doesn't know where she is. Zat≈çichi seeks out Sukegoro, and tells him that two men have died for him in his petty crime wars, and because of this he too must die. The film ends abruptly with Zat≈çichi having just delivered what is presumably the killing cut. Cast * Shintar≈ç Katsu as Zat≈çichi * Yoshie Mizutani (Yaeko Mizutani) as Osetsu * Masayo Banri as Otane * Tomisabur≈ç Wakayama (credited as J≈ç Kenzabur≈ç) as Nagisa no Yoshir≈ç * Yutaka Nakamura as Kagami no Sanz≈ç * S≈çnosuke Sawamura as Seki no Kanbei * Eijir≈ç Yanagi as Sukegor≈ç Hanoka * Sabur≈ç Date as Morisuke Critical response DVD Talk's review judges The Tale of Zatoichi Continues to be less interesting in plot than the previous film, The Tale of Zatoichi, but more quickly-paced than the first film. According to the review, the musical score by Ichir≈ç Sait≈ç is more melodramatic than Akira Ifukube's score for the first film, though melodrama is not out of character for the series. The casting of Tomisaburo Wakayama‚Äîlead actor Shintaro Katsu's older brother‚Äîin the role of Yoshir≈ç, the one-armed swordsman, lends the film more interest. In Stray Dogs & Lone Wolves: The Samurai Film Handbook (2005), Patrick Galloway also judges the pacing of this second film in the series to be tighter than the first. He notes that this film has the first large-scale battle in the series, with Zat≈çichi taking on fifty to sixty opponents at once. Galloway praises Katsu's ability to move quickly in a way that obscures the choreography in the fights. Availability The Tale of Zatoichi Continues was released theatrically on October 12, 1962. In Japan, the film has been released on videotape in 1984 and 1992, and in DVD format in 2003. Home Vision Entertainment released it in the US on DVD on May 14, 2002.

Biography Andrews was born in Houston. He was educated at Princeton University, graduating in 1927. He then worked for a number of years in the cotton business before enrolling at the South Texas College of Law, from which he received his law degree in 1934. Andrews joined the United States Navy in 1942 as a lieutenant. He was quickly promoted to lieutenant commander, commander, and captain. He became responsible for purchasing airplanes, engines, and ships for the Navy. In 1946, he became chief of Navy procurement, and in the same year was awarded the Navy's Legion of Merit. At this time, Andrews was responsible for drafting the Armed Services Procurement Act. President of the United States Harry S. Truman nominated Andrews as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1948, and Andrews served in that position from January 21, 1948 to February 15, 1949. As Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Andrews was responsible for procurement, supplies, civilian personnel, shipyards, oil reserves, budgeting and expenditures. Upon retiring from the United States Department of the Navy, Andrews bought and reorganized an oil equipment company, Dixel Manufacturing. He also became an independent oil producer, and went on to be president of two textile companies, Westmoreland Manufacturing and Andrews, Loop & Company. Finally, Andrews founded Ancon Oil & Gas and served as Ancon's president for 35 years. In addition to his work as a businessman, Andrews served as a part- time law school instructor; as a director of the English-Speaking Union; as advisory chairman of the Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens; and as a trustee of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts. He purchased Knappogue Castle and its surrounding lands in County Clare, Ireland in 1966, and together with his wife Lavonne (a prominent American architect), in collaboration with what was then Shannon Free Airport Development Company (today Shannon Heritage) and Bord Failte Eireann, carried out an extensive restoration of the area around 1969. In 1965, he published a book, Law vs. Equity in the \\"Merchant of Venice\\". He also authored books on his experiences with the Navy and on the oil business. Following a stroke, Andrews died at his home on Houston on August 22, 1992. He was 88 years old. References * Bruce Lambert, \\"Mark E.

The resolution therefore allowed 21,000 police and domestic and international troops to remain the country. The resolution assigned the mission with three main tasks, to: :(a) ensure the effective protection of civilians, humanitarian and UN personnel and facilities; :(b) carry out disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of foreign and Congolese troops; :(c) support government efforts to improve security and stability in the country. The Council also reiterated its concern about continued violations of human rights in the conflict zones, urging the Congolese government \\"to effectively protect the civilian population, to develop sustainable security sector institutions which fully respect the rule of law and to ensure respect for human rights and the fight against impunity.\\" It called upon the Lord's Resistance Army and Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda in particular to cease all forms of violence. The Council requested the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to conduct a strategic review of the situation in the DR Congo and MONUC's progress towards achieving its mandate, taking into account the Integrated Strategic Framework for the United Nations presence in the country by 1 April 2010. With this in mind, the Council proposed to extend MONUC in the future, once it had found ways for it to better protect civilians.

It is considered the wild ancestor of the domestic zebu cattle, which is mainly found in the Indian subcontinent and has been introduced in many other parts of the world, like Africa and South America. In contrast, the domesticated taurine cattle breeds, which are native to Europe, the Near East, and other parts of the world, are descendants of the Eurasian aurochs (Bos primigenius primigenius). According to IUCN, the Indian aurochs disappeared before the 13th century AD, leaving only the Bos primigenius primigenius, whose range was by then restricted to Europe. The wild population of Indian aurochs was likely extinct millennia earlier than that; the most recent skeletal remains, from Uttar Pradesh, date from around 1,800 BC.Chen et al., 2010: \\"Zebu cattle are an exclusive legacy of the South Asia Neolithic.\\" Molecular biology and evolution, 27(1), 1-6.  Description  The Indian aurochs is known from fossil and subfossil remains. These show relatively slight differences to the Eurasian aurochs (B. p. primigenius).Raphael Pumpelly: Explorations in Turkestan: Expedition of 1904 : vol.2, p. 361 The Indian aurochs was probably smaller than its Eurasian counterpart but had proportionally larger horns.Cis van Vuure: Retracing the Aurochs - History, Morphology and Ecology of an extinct wild Ox. 2005, . Because the range of the aurochs probably was continuous from Portugal to India, it is uncertain whether there was a clear distinction or a continuum between the Eurasian and Indian subspecies. Engraving from the Bhimbetka rock shelters, which might show an Indian aurochs from the Pleistocene The Indian aurochs diverged from the Eurasian aurochs (B. p. primigenius) about 100,000‚Äì200,000 years ago. This has been shown by comparison of DNA from zebus and taurine cattle breeds, the living descendants of these two aurochs forms.Verkaar, Nijman, Beeke, Hanekamp & Lenstra: Maternal and Paternal Lineages in Cross-breeding bovine species. Has Wisent a Hybrid Origin?. 2004.

Abstract  Range  The aurochs originated about 2 million years ago in India and spread westwards. The Indian aurochs roamed in the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs throughout the Indian subcontinent from Baluchistan, the Indus valley and the Ganges valley to south India. Most remains are from the north of India, on the Kathiawar Peninsula, along the Ganges, and from the area of the Narmada River. However, bone remains of the Indian aurochs are present in the south as well, such as the Deccan area and along the Krishna area. The wild Indian aurochs survived into neolithic times, when it was domesticated around 9,000 YBP, and co-existed with human pastoralism spreading throughout India around 5,500‚Äì4,000 YBP. The youngest known remains from southern India, which clearly belong to wild Indian aurochs are from Banahalli in Karnataka, with an age of about 4200 years old. In northern India, the most recent remains date from 1,800 BC, from Koldihwa/Mahagara, Uttar Pradesh. Possible predators preying on the wild type of the zebu were big cats such as lions, leopards and tigers, as well as other predatory mammals such as dholes and even giant hyenas during prehistoric times. Feral zebu cattle roaming free at Keoladeo Ghana National Park, India  Domestication  The Indian aurochs was domesticated in northern India, producing zebu or indicine cattle. The primary centre of the Indian aurochs' domestication was most probably the Indus River valley, now the Baluchistan region in Pakistan. The domestication process seems to have been prompted by the arrival of new crop species from the Near East around 9,000 YBP. Human pastoralism, enabled by domestic cattle, spread throughout the subcontinent around 5,500‚Äì4,000 YBP. Secondary domestication events - instances of additional genetic diversity acquired from interbreeding domesticated proto- indicine stock with wild aurochs cows - occurred very frequently in the Ganges basin but less so in southern India. It was in the Ganges valley, in Uttar Pradesh, that the most recent evidence of wild aurochs was found. Domestic zebu are recorded from the Indus region since 6000 BC and from south India, the middle Ganges region, and Gujarat since 2000‚Äì3500 BC. Domestic cattle seem to have been absent in southern China and southeast Asia until 2000‚Äì1000 BC, when indicine cattle first appeared there.

Films=FrackNation FrackNation is a feature documentary that claims to address misinformation about the process of hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. It premiered in 2013 on Mark Cuban's AXS TV and was distributed by Magnolia Pictures in 2014. FrackNation was inspired by a confrontation between Josh Fox, the director of the 2010 documentary Gasland, and McAleer. While Fox was promoting his film project McAleer confronted him about the historical records of people being able to ignite natural gas in water at \\"Burning Springs\\" long before fracking started. McAleer told the Los Angeles Times that Fox did not include that information in his film because he did not think it was relevant towards the current drilling impacts of certain areas.Los Angeles Times, Pro-fracking movie gets $22K in two days on Kickstarter, 8 February 2012 McAleer told Politico he was motivated to make the film by the \\"one-sided approach taken by the media, 'outsiders' and 'urban elites'\\" on the fracking process. McAleer said there has been no real debate on the issue, with the environmental lobby relying on emotion and scare tactics to condemn fracking.Politico, New film in defense of fracking, 2 February 2012 In an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette McAleer stressed the film is trying to show both sides of the fracking discussion. \\"We're definitely covering the contamination\\" in the film, McAleer said. \\"We feature both sides.\\" McAleer makes this claim of featuring both sides yet does not address air pollution caused by fracking at all in his documentary. Additionally, McAleer only visits the towns of Dish, TX and Dimock, PA to investigate water contamination, his documentary does not address the numerous other claims of water contamination around the US.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Industry gets cast in 'FrackNation,' the latest documentary on the drilling debate, 4 March 2012 In 2013, a sequel to Gasland titled Gasland Part II premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City on 21 April 2013. A group of farmers, who were featured in FrackNation, along with McAleer and McElhinney, were not admitted into the premiere and claimed that it was because they asked difficult questions; organizers said that after guests who had purchased advance tickets and waited in line had been admitted, the screening was full.Fox News, 'FrackNation' filmmaker claims group of farmers was barred from 'Gasland Part II' screening at Tribeca, 23 April 2013 Not Evil Just Wrong Not Evil Just Wrong is a film McElhinney and McAleer directed and produced to challenge Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. It suggests that the evidence for human-caused global warming is inconclusive, and that the impact of suggested legislation for mitigating climate change would be much more harmful to humans than beneficial. The movie was filmed in 2008, and was screened at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam and at the Right Online conference in 2009. In 2010, the directors cooperated with the Independent Women's Forum to create a program, Balanced Education for Everyone (B.E.E.) that seeks to place Not Evil Just Wrong in schools.

The film looked at how the lives of the poor people in the area would have been affected if the mine had been built. McAleer agreed to film the documentary, funded by the Canadian Mining Company featured in the movie, after the company guaranteed that he and wife would retain creative control over its content.Guardian Unlimited, Rory Carroll on Mind Your Own Business, 1 November 2006 McAleer said of his findings during the shoot: > It was surprising that environmentalists would lie, but the most shocking > part was yet to come.

In the documentary, McAleer films Mark Fenn from the World Wildlife Fund, who is shown living in luxurious conditions, at one point showing off his $35,000 sailboat to the cameras, all the while advocating the value of living a simplistic, village life. The Search for Tristan's Mum McElhinney and McAleer directed and co-produced \\"The Search for Tristan's Mum,\\" which highlights the case of a toddler Tristan Dowse who was adopted by an Irish couple at birth‚Äîand then abandoned in an Indonesian orphanage two years later. It broadcast on RT√â 1, the Irish state television station, in 2005.The Search for Tristan's Mum, RT√â Tristan Dowse was an Indonesian boy adopted by an Irish man, Joe Dowse, and his Azerbaijani wife, Lala. After two years, Tristan was abandoned at the Indonesian orphanage from where he had been originally adopted, when, according to the Dowses, the adoption \\"hadn't worked out.\\" At that stage, his adoption had been recognised by the Irish Adoption Board and he had been granted Irish citizenship. He could only speak English. In 2005, McAleer and McElhinney reunited the young boy with his natural mother, Suryani. In 2006, an Irish court ordered the Dowses to pay an immediate lump sum of ‚Ç¨20,000 to Tristan, maintenance of ‚Ç¨350 per month until he is 18 years of age, and a further lump sum of ‚Ç¨25,000 when he reaches the age of 18. In addition, Tristan would remain an Irish citizen and enjoy all the rights to the Dowses' estate. Tristan's adoption was struck off the Register of Foreign Adoptions held by the Irish Adoption Board and Suryani was appointed his sole legal guardian. This film was selected to be part of Input 2006, a showcase for programs representing national public broadcasters from around the world, and was duly screened for industry professionals at the film festival that year in Taiwan in May.

Her work often focuses on conflicts and human rights issues, especially the role of women in traditional societies. Life and work Lynsey Addario was born and raised in Westport, Connecticut to parents Camille and Phillip Addario, both Italian-American hairdressers. She graduated from Staples High School, in Westport, Connecticut in 1991 and from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1995.[4] She also holds two Honorary Doctorate Degrees, one from the University Of Wisconsin-Madison in Humanities, and another from Bates College in Maine. Addario began photographing professionally with Buenos Aires Herald in Argentina in 1996 with, as she says, \\"no previous photographic training‚Äù. In the late 1990s, she moved back to the United States and freelanced for the Associated Press in New York City, only to move back to South America less than one year later. Focusing on Cuba and the effect of communism on the public, Addario made a name for herself. She moved to India a few years later to photograph under the Associated Press, leaving the United States. While living in India, Addario traveled through Nepal, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, focusing on humanitarian and women's issues. After the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, Addario resolved to photograph Afghanistan and Pakistan under the Taliban. While in Pakistan, Addario was given her big break and put on rotation for The New York Times. During this time, she ‚Äúused her gender to get inside the women‚Äôs Madrases to interview and photograph the most devout Pakistani women.‚Äù Addario spoke at length with her subjects, inspiring her to use photography to ‚Äúdispel stereotypes or misconceptions; of presenting the counterintuitive.‚Äù In 2003 and 2004, Addario photographed the Iraq war in Baghdad for The New York Times. She has since covered conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Darfur, Republic of the Congo, and Haiti. She has covered stories throughout the Middle East and Africa. In August 2004 she turned her attention to Africa, focusing on Chad and Sudan. She has photographed for The New York Times, The New York Times Magazine, Time, Newsweek, and National Geographic. In Pakistan on May 9, 2009, Addario was involved in an automobile accident while returning to Islamabad from an assignment at a refugee camp. Her collar bone was broken, another journalist was injured, and the driver was killed. Addario was one of four New York Times journalists who were missing in Libya from March 16‚Äì21, 2011. The New York Times reported on March 18, 2011 that Libya had agreed to free her and three colleagues: Anthony Shadid, Stephen Farrell and Tyler Hicks. The Libyan government released the four journalists on March 21, 2011. She reports that she was threatened with death and repeatedly groped during her captivity by the Libyan Army. In November 2011, The New York Times wrote a letter of complaint on behalf of Addario to the Israeli government, after allegations that Israeli soldiers at the Erez Crossing had strip-searched and mocked her and forced her to go through an X-ray scanner three times despite knowing that she was pregnant.\\"Israel apologizes to American journalist for overly intrusive search\\", Haaretz, November 28, 2011. Addario reported that she had \\"never, ever been treated with such blatant cruelty.\\"\\"Defence Ministry apologizes to NY Times\\", Jerusalem Post, November 28, 2011. The Israeli Defence ministry subsequently issued an apology to both Addario and The New York Times. The extensive exhibition In Afghanistan at the Nobel Peace Center in Oslo, Norway has her photos of Afghan women juxtaposed with Tim Hetherington's photographs from American soldiers in the Korangal Valley. Addario's recent bodies of work include \\"Finding Home\\" a year-long documentary following three Syrian refugee families and their stateless newborns over the course of one year as they await asylum in Europe for Time, The Changing Face of Saudi Women for National Geographic and \\"The Displaced\\" for The New York Times Magazine, a reportage documenting the lives of three children displaced from war in Syria, Ukraine, and South Sudan. Addario has spent the last four years documenting the plight of Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq for The New York Times, and she has covered the civil war in South Sudan, and Maternal Mortality in Assam, India, and Sierra Leone for Time. In 2015, Addario published her memoir It's What I Do: A Photographer's Life of Love and War and Warner Bros bought the rights to a movie based on the memoir, to be directed by Steven Spielberg and to star Jennifer Lawrence as Addario. She also released a photography book in October 2018 titled ‚ÄúOf Love and War‚Äù. Family Addario is married to Paul de Bendern, a journalist with Reuters. They married in July 2009.

Early life Peress was born in the Bronx on July 31, 1917. The son of a tailor, he was raised in Manhattan and attended George Washington High School. He graduated from the City College of New York, where he was a member of the Reserve Officer Training Corps. He graduated from the New York University College of Dentistry in 1940 and established a practice in New York City.Army Personnel Actions Relating to Irving Peress He became involved in politics after marrying Elaine Gittelson, an English teacher who became a therapist and psychiatric social worker. In the 1940s, he indicated the American Labor Party (ALP) as the party choice on his voter registration form. (New York voter registration and elections include party enrollment and closed primaries.) As a liberal third party, the ALP was a frequent target of anti-Communists who viewed it as a Communist front.Mark Hamilton Lytle, America's Uncivil Wars : The Sixties Era from Elvis to the Fall of Richard Nixon (Oxford University Press), p. 21 Military service Peress applied for a commission as an Army dentist during World War II, but failed his physical because of a hernia and did not serve.David M. Oshinsky, A Conspiracy so Immense: The World of Joe McCarthy (2005), p. 365 Peress was maintaining a thriving practice by the early 1950s when doctors and dentists were being drafted for the Korean War. He gained weight in an effort to aggravate his high blood pressure, fail his physical, and avoid induction into the military. After passing the physical, he applied for and received a commission as a captain in the Army Dental Corps. He was inducted into the Army Reserve on October 5, 1952, and reported for active duty on January 3, 1953.Arthur Herman, Joseph McCarthy: Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator (NY: The Free Press, 2000), pp. 247-8 Originally slated for assignment to Japan, Peress asked for and received a compassionate reassignment based on his wife's and daughter's illnesses. He was reassigned to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.Thomas C. Reeves, The Life and Times of Joe McCarthy: A Biography (1982), p. 537 As part of his application for his commission, Peress signed an oath indicating that he had never been a member of an organization that sought to overthrow the U.S. government by unconstitutional means.Scott Heidepriem, A Fair Chance for a Free People: A Biography of Karl E. Mundt (1988), p. 168 When he later completed a more detailed questionnaire, Peress responded to queries about membership in the Communist party or affiliated organizations with the phrase \\"federal constitutional privilege\\", an allusion to the Fifth Amendment. The chief dental surgeon at Camp Kilmer later testified that Peress had no access to sensitive information there and that he and his assistant had, at the request of the camp's intelligence officer, monitored Peress' activities without discovering anything at all suspicious. Although this monitoring failed to uncover any wrongdoing by Peress, he still received fitness reports that called him a \\"very disloyal and untrustworthy type of officer\\" and stated that he was devoting himself to \\"the seeding of dissatisfaction\\". Target of McCarthy In October 1953, Peress was promoted to Major, even though his commanding officer had recommended that Peress be separated from the military because of suspicions stemming from his questionnaire answers. The Army later described it as a \\"readjustment in rank\\" made to comply with the Doctors' Draft Act, a recent law that required that the rank of military medical professionals reflect their level of experience. Soon after Peress was promoted, the Senate Government Operations Committee received an anonymous complaint stating that Peress had been promoted even though he was under surveillance for communist activities. As a result of the complaint and subsequent inquiries, Army leaders decided in January 1954 that an honorable discharge was the quickest way to remove Peress from the military and resolve the issue. Senator Joseph McCarthy, Chairman of the Government Operations Committee and its Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, decided to hold hearings on Peress' promotion and pending discharge to illustrate McCarthy's claim that the Army was \\"soft on communism\\" because it tolerated an inefficient bureaucracy that failed to maintain security standards. Peress appeared before McCarthy's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on January 30, 1954, and invoked the Fifth Amendment dozens of times in his testimony. He said he had and would continue to oppose any group that sought a violent or unconstitutional overthrow of the U.S. government. McCarthy called Peress \\"the key to the deliberate Communist infiltration of our Armed Forces\\" and a \\"Fifth Amendment Communist.\\" Peress upbraided his questioners by saying that anyone, even a senator, who equated the invoking of the Fifth Amendment with guilt was himself guilty of subversion. McCarthy wrote a letter to Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens calling for Peress to be court-martialed. He called for an investigation into the Army's handling of Peress' commissioning and promotion.Dwight D. Eisenhower, The White House Years:A Personal Account, volume 1: Mandate For Change 1953-1956 (1965), p. 322 Stevens believed that Peress' refusals to answer the Committee's questions did not provide grounds for court-martial and approved Peress' discharge on February 2. On February 18, 1954, Brigadier General Ralph W. Zwicker, who had been in command at Camp Kilmer, was recalled from Japan to testify, and refused to say who had authorized Peress' promotion to Major or honorable discharge. McCarthy told Zwicker he was \\"not fit to wear that uniform.\\" An FBI witness named Ruth Eagle, an undercover member of the New York City Police Department, testified on February 18, 1954, that Peress and his wife had been involved with the Communist party in the 1930s and 1940s and that Peress had been a leader of the American Labor Party.Haynes Johnson The Age of Anxiety: McCarthyism to Terrorism (2006), p. 351 McCarthy said that Peress' promotion had been ordered by a \\"silent master who decreed special treatment for Communists\\". During confrontational testimony interrupted by several shouting matches with McCarthy, Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens told the committee on March 24, 1955, that \\"some very bad mistakes\\" had allowed Peress' promotion. The Army granted Peress an honorable discharge on March 31, 1954. In June 1954, the Army delivered the Subcommittee on Investigations a report on the Peress case that detailed those responsible for approving his promotion and discharge. It admitted to procedural \\"blunders\\" that had resulted in the rewriting of regulations to avoid similar cases and said those responsible had been disciplined. McCarthy, defending his pursuit of the Peress case when faced with censure, told a Senate committee that his own investigation contradicted Army witnesses and showed that Peress had been considered for \\"sensitive work\\" in May 1953. McCarthy's confrontational approach, coupled with his pressure on the Army for preferential treatment of committee staff member G. David Schine, was looked on in retrospect as the beginning of McCarthy's downfall, leading to the Senate's censure of McCarthy.Lawrence N. Stout, Covering McCarthyism: How the Christian Science Monitor Handled Joseph R. McCarthy (1999), p. 123Barry M. Goldwater, With No Apologies: The Personal and Political Memoirs of United States Senator Barry M. Goldwater (1979), p. 60Arthur V. Watkins, Enough Rope: the Inside Story of the Censure of Senator Joe McCarthy (1969), p. 21 Later events Following the hearings, Peress reported receiving anti-Semitic hate mail and the Peress home in Queens was stoned in late February 1954. He commented: Peress was persuaded to remove his name from the door of his dental practice. His wife was pressured to resign as editor of the Parent-Teachers Association monthly bulletin at their local public school. In 1976, he reflected on his experience: In an interview in 2005, he repeatedly declined to say whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party. Asked if he agreed with Communism, he replied: He said that if he had explained his political beliefs at the Army-McCarthy hearings: Retirement and death Peress maintained his dental practice until 1980 and retired in 1982. He was still residing in the New York City area when he gave an interview in 2005. Peress died at his home in Queens on November 13, 2014. According to one of his sons, Peress had suffered complications and declining health after breaking a leg in a fall, but was determined to live long enough to watch Major League Baseball's 2014 World Series. Peress' son stated that afterwards, Peress intentionally stopped taking his thyroid medication. ReferencesExternal links * *Army Personnel Actions Relating to Irving Peress.

They first appear in history during the late Republic, remaining on the periphery of the Roman aristocracy until the time of Nero. Another family of Caesonii attained the consulship several times beginning in the late second century; it is not clear how or whether they were related to the earlier Caesonii. Origin The nomen Caesonius is a patronymic surname, based on the praenomen Caeso, which must have belonged to the ancestor of the gens.Chase, p. 119. The Caesonii of the second and third centuries appear to have been an unremarkable family, of senatorial or equestrian rank, which eventually was elevated to the patriciate, holding many of the most important offices in the Roman state. This branch of the family may have originated in Latium or the surrounding region, perhaps the town of Antium.Mennen, pp. 55, 56, 63.

A student of the painter Karl Zerbe at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Gibran first received acclaim as a magic realist painter in the late 1940s when he exhibited with other emerging artists later known as the \\"Boston Expressionists\\".Boston Expressionism Called a \\"master of materials\\", as both artist and restorer, Gibran turned to sculpture in the mid-fifties. In 1972, in an effort to separate his identity from his famous relative and namesake, the author of The Prophet, Gibran Kahlil Gibran, who was cousin both to his father Nicholas Gibran and his mother Rose Gibran, the sculptor co-authored with his wife Jean a biography of the poet entitled Kahlil Gibran His Life And World. Gibran is known for multiple skills, including painting; wood, wax, and stone carving; welding; and instrument making.  Early years = Childhood  Gibran aspired to be an artist since he was seven. The third of five children, he was inspired by his namesake cousin and godfather, the poet Gibran Kahlil Gibran. Related to the author on both sides of his family, he was nurtured by his Lebanese immigrant family in Boston. Gibran spent hours in his father's woodworking workshop. From his cabinet-maker father, he learned about instrument making and helped fashion stringed instruments, including a miniature violin that he treasured all his life. Gibran lived in what is now Chinatown, Boston, and attended local public schools. As a boy, he frequented the Denison House where he occasionally would see social worker Amelia Earhart drive up in her famous yellow roadster. He regularly visited the local public library and enjoyed crafting exotic objects like the scimitar in Edgar Allan Poe's The Pit and the Pendulum or the guillotine from Tale of Two Cities. At eleven, he received Honorable Mention in a national soap-carving contest, and during his senior year at English High School, was awarded the Lawrence Prize for Art.  Studying  Gibran entered the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1940. He was offered a full scholarship if he concentrated on sculpture. However, he chose a partial scholarship given by the painting department where he studied with Karl Zerbe. The experience shaped his career. ‚ÄúIt was an atelier\\", he recalled. ‚ÄúThey let us develop our own vision while grounding us in the fundamentals ‚Äì drawing, anatomy, techniques, and materials\\". Winner of The Boit Summer Competition in 1942, the young artist soon was recognized as a master of diverse materials. He was known as jittery Gibran for prodigious production fueled by an abundance of nervous energy and for his deep concern that he not be a burden to his family. In 1943, shortly after his study for a mural Entr√©e √° Paradis was awarded the Karl Zerbe prize, he left school in order to apprentice at several craft-related organizations. For a period during World War II, he served as draftsman at Harvard's Underwater Sound Laboratory. Later his carving skills led him to work for Martin Heiligmann, a gilder of fine objects and frames. Finding a Joy Street studio on Beacon Hill, he also started to work for Boris Mirski whose Charles Street Gallery was attracting Boston artists and collectors. Word of the young artist's talent spread, and Gibran briefly honed his skills at the Conservation Laboratory of Harvard University's Fogg Museum. He finally located a studio at 15 Fayette Street in Boston's Bay Village, where he settled in as a freelancer, restoring and repairing fine art objects during the day, and painting at night. Shortly after moving, he met sculptor and conservator Morton C. Bradley. The two would maintain a lifelong friendship.  Early career = Painting  Gibran first displayed original creative work at Boris Mirski's Charles Street Gallery in 1944. A January 1946 review of his pictures at the Stuart Art Gallery, introduced him to Boston's art world: ‚ÄúMr. Gibran is in his early twenties. ... He is a mystic and seeks a symbolism which can convey transcendent ideas... a romantic of the artistic clan of Redon.Dorothy Adlow, ‚ÄúFrancis Criss, Kahlil Gibran Show Works\\", Christian Science Monitor (January 18, 1946), p. 9 In another Stuart Art Gallery exhibit, Study of a Head by Kahlil Gibran was described as ‚Äúthe tenuous enterprise of another young Boston mystic\\".Dorothy Adlow, ‚ÄúBack From War Seen in Show at Stuart Gallery\\", Christian Science Monitor (July 15, 1946), p. 4 Soon his paintings appeared at Symphony Hall, along with panels by his mentor Karl Zerbe in a selection of work by contemporary artists titled Fantasy in Art. One reviewer wrote: ‚ÄúThere are also among these fantasts, visionary artists who perceive images in tenuous dreamlike mists... The portrait for example by Kahlil Gibran\\".Dorothy Adlow, ‚ÄúContemporary Painters Seen in Display at Symphony Hall\\", The Christian Science Monitor (December 16, 1946), unpaged clipping. By June 1947, a New York Times review of paintings he exhibited at Jacques Seligmann's gallery in the group show, Artists Under 25, acknowledged his efforts with the brief but laudatory comment, ‚ÄúKahlil Gibran works subtly and effectively in encaustic\\".Edward Alden Jewell, ‚Äú New Group Twenty-Five and Under\\", New York Times (June 8, 1947), unpaged clipping. Five months later, Boston's Institute of Modern Art (now Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston) featured works ‚Äúcarefully chosen from the recent production of notable artists in Massachusetts\\".Portrait of the Art World: A Century of ART news, photographs. Deidre Enterprises Publishers in association with National Portrait Gallery Smithsonian Institution and Yale University Press, 2002, pose variant from John Brook photo, Plate 29 Exhibitors included Karl Knaths, Edward Hopper and Edwin Dickinson along with younger Boston artists. ART news published a John Brook portrait of eleven Boston painters including Karl Zerbe, Reed Champion, Ture Bengtz, Giglio Dante, Maud Morgan, and Lawrence Kupferman. The photograph shows a serious and pensive Gibran in profile seated on a ladder near the painter Esther Geller. In her review of this seminal show, Dorothy Adlow, wrote in the Christian Science Monitor: ‚ÄúKahlil Gibran, who like Mr.David Aronson is 24 years old, paints a Piet√† in oil with remarkable technical adaptation of pigment\\".Dorothy Adlow, ‚ÄúMassachusetts Painters in 1947\\", Christian Science Monitor (November 10, 1947), unpaged clipping. And later, when the Piet√† was exhibited in a March, 1948 Artists‚Äô Equity show, this critic heralded it as ‚Äúone of the more distinguished pictures painted in Boston in recent years\\".Dorothy Adlow, ‚ÄúArtists‚Äô Equity Exhibition\\", Christian Science Monitor (March 22, 1948, p. 4 Within a year, his identity as a ‚Äúvisionary‚Äù with great technique was spreading. Reviewing contemporary New England painters at the Fitchburg Art Center, Ms. Adlow reinforced this image: ‚ÄúThe Old Fashioned Bouque‚Äô by Kahlil Gibran sets forth once again the sensitive gift of that young visionary. Mr. Gibran employs his wax technique most effectively. He works with consistency, grace, and poetry\\".Dorothy Adlow, ‚ÄúVaried Styles Displayed at Fitchburg Art Center\\", Christian Science Monitor: (June 7, 1947), unpaged clipping, Gibran continued to exhibit in group shows at the Niveau Gallery, and made his New York solo debut at the Mortimer Levitt Gallery, April 1948. In The Artists Speaks, Adlow again introduced him:Dorothy Adlow, ‚ÄúThe Artist Speaks\\", Christian Science Monitor (April 9, 1949) p, 6 \\"Gibran is one of the exceptional group of talented artists who have come to the fore in Boston in the last few years. He has a rare capacity of envisioning intangibles, for conjuring the immaterial in tenuousness and exiguousness of concrete image... the most recent painting Joseph‚Äôs Cloak discards the subdued chromatic scheme for a rich palette of colors that sing out movingly\\".  Time in Provincetown  By June 1949, then married to Eleanor ‚ÄúElly‚Äù Mott a fellow student at Museum School, Gibran began working for the sculptor Ken Campbell during a summer in Provincetown. With his growing reputation as a magic realist, he formed close friendships with several Provincetown artists, including Varujan Boghosian, Mischa Richter, Giglio Dante, poet Cecil Hemley, and painter/poet Weldon Kees. For editor Hemley's The Noonday Presshttps://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat;=19630505&id;=UmkUAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=OgEEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5430,6181460 he designed that publishing house's first colophon. He also became involved with Forum 49, founded by Hemley and Kees a pivotal event in American 20th century culture. Jules Aarons brilliant physicist and photographer of Provincetown's artistic community documented Gibran, his wife, and colleagues during that fecund period. Notable is a portrait of the artist with his fish skeleton painting On the Beach shown at Gallery 200 during the original exhibit of Forum 49, and then again, at the Provincetown Art Association's fiftieth anniversary memorial show in 1999. Spending summers in Provincetown, Gibran and his wife opened a boutique called Paraphernalia. It became known for its fanciful signs, innovative displays and handsome mannequins, all crafted by Gibran. But soon, railing at life as shopkeeper, he explored other avenues professionally and personally. The couple agreed to separate, Gibran returning to Boston and Elly taking over the shop.  Innovation  During the early fifties, Gibran, with the young Boston painter William Georgenes, spent two summers in Nantucket, working on new paintings and exploring new techniques. Always experimenting with the latest in materials, he and artist Alfred Duca, also living at the 15 Fayette Street studio, made major media breakthroughs. New Plastic Medium Used by Painter was Dorothy Adlow's response to Gibran's innovative technique shown at the Margaret Brown Gallery, during the winter of 1952.Dorothy Adlow, ‚ÄúNew Plastic Medium Used By Painter\\", Christian Science Monitor (February 28, 1952) p, 6 At 30, Gibran turned to a completely new art form. ‚ÄúMy marriage was breaking up..\\"., he told the Globe in 1967. \\"I had too much energy.... After my divorce, psychiatry made me understand I had to sculpt\\".Gregory Mcdonald ‚Äúthe second Kahlil Gibran: Boston sculptor who has emerged from the shadow of the poet\\", Boston Sunday Globe Magazine (January 1, 1967) p. 7 Crediting Dr. Clemens Benda, with pointing his way to sculpture and, in some ways, transforming his entire persona, even his approach to art, Gibran developed a strong bond with that Jungian psychiatrist. He had learned of him from Hyman Bloom< who, like many Boston artists of the period, were searching for spirituality in non-traditional ways.  Instrument-building  Vihuela built by Kahlil Gibran Throughout the 1940s, Gibran's friendship with Bloom was, in part, due to their mutual devotion to the music of what was then called ‚Äúthe Orient\\". The young Gibran had always searched for recordings of early 20th century Arabic singers and instrumentalists, and soon joined a group of devotees of Middle Eastern and Indian music that included Bloom, composer Alan Hovhaness, painter Hermon Di Giovanno, sculptors Frank and Jean Teddy Tock, Dr. Betty Gregory, and, later on, James Rubin, founder of Boston's Pan Orient Arts Foundation. As Gibran's reputation for building instruments grew, he also repaired instruments for players from local nightclubs as well as creating and restoring instruments for the Museum of Fine Arts Boston] and folk musicians. Self-taught luthier, he began constructing ouds, sazes, Renaissance-type lutes, and even bows. His vihuela, a 15th-16th century Spanish forerunner of today's guitar, was admired and played by many classical guitarists, and featured in a 1954 concert Court Music Of The Spanish Renaissance at the Museum of Fine Arts. Throughout his life, he continued to indulge his passion for building violins as well as other exotic instruments. In the early 90s he took time to self-publish his deeply researched theory illuminating the mystery of the brilliant tonal quality of Stradivarius and other Cremonese fiddle-makers. Observations On The Reasons For The Cremona Tone appeared in the January 1994 bulletin of the Southern California Violin Makers, with the convincing and tested argument that burnishing the wood face of instruments prior to varnishing created a compressed, non-spongy, and more resonant soundboard, and consequent tonal brilliance and richness.  Middle years = Sculpting  For the next 6 decades, Gibran mostly concentrated on sculpture. Experimenting with metal, he constructed his initial figures from wire found while beachcombing in Nantucket; soon he was combining this technique with thermal metal spraying. By the mid-fifties, Gibran enrolled in Boston's Wentworth Institute of Technology where he learned the oxy-acetylene welding process. Within months, he had begun work on his first major welded figure John the Baptist voted \\"Most Popular\\" in the 1956 Boston Arts Festival and named ‚Äúa show stopper and crowd-collector‚Äù Edgar J. Driscoll JR. ‚ÄúThe 1956 Arts Festival ‚Äì Hail and Farewell‚Äù, The Boston Globe, (June 25, 1956) unpaged clipping by the Boston Globe‚Äôs Edgar Driscoll. Gibran explained the process of creating John the Baptist years later in Sculpture Review in a paragraph reminiscent of Michelangelo's statement that a sculpture was simply waiting to be released from within the block of marble:Kahlil Gibran, ‚ÄúSculpture in Process‚Äù National Sculpture Review, V. 19 1970‚Äì71 pp. 23-25 \\"John the Baptist, my first welded figure grew out of a fascination for a jumble of baling wire discovered on a Boston wharf. [n.b.: The same wharf where today‚Äôs Institute of Contemporary Art is located]. His staff ‚Äì a tie rod for piers ‚Äì was eroded by the sea into a most beautifully organic and tactile iron length. The figure was already there. All that was required was order. It was all there, the conceptual and the technical ‚Äì the raw and primal qualities of John in the desert reflected through nature‚Äôs brutalization of man‚Äôs objects\\". Voice in the Wilderness, a welded iron rod 7-foot figure received the George D. Widener Gold medal at the Pennsylvania Academy Annual in 1958. A year later, Pieta exhibited at the eighth Boston Arts Festival received acclaim as articulated by The New York Times critic Stuart Preston: ‚ÄúThis year‚Äôs Grand Prize in art was awarded to ... Gilbert Franklins‚Äô Beach Figure ... but it must have been a close thing deciding between it and Kahlil Gibran's noble and expressive Pieta\\".Stuart Preston, ‚ÄúSummer Art Activity In Boston‚Äù, New York Times (June 14, 1959) p. 9 Concurrent with his welded figures, Gibran was accepting commissions for decorative works that at times were combinations of wood carving or of metal abstract extruded welded metal wall hangings. For one Chestnut Hill mansion designed by Walter Bogner and its adjacent pool house designed by Saltonstall and Morton, now included in a list of National Historic Buildings, Gibran executed a 100-foot welded Corten steel fence surrounding the swimming pool, doorknobs and other hand wrought architectural features throughout the home, culminating with his sculpture Javelier.  Publications  Sculpture/Kahlil Gibran published by The Bartlett Press in 1970, focused on the artist's welded iron and hammered steel works. Once more, Gibran, turned to a completely different art form. With his second wife, Jean English Gibran, he spent three years co-authoring the definitive biography of his relative, Gibran Kahlil Gibran, the author of The Prophet. Kahlil Gibran His Life and World, published first by New York Graphic Society in 1974, and by Interlink in 1991, was an effort not only to separate his and the poet's identities, but also to present a well researched, accurate story of the adolescent's immersion in Boston's cultural life shortly after his arrival in 1895, and his meteoric rise in the world of arts and letters.  Commissions and monuments  Immediately after the appearance of the biography of his famous relative, Gibran abandoned welding, but branched out to several fields that had fascinated him.Sculptor‚Äôs Statement, St. Botolph Club Announcement 125th Anniversary Event 'Unveiling of Kahlil Gibran‚Äôs Sculpture The Greeter ' January, 2005 A long time admirer and collector of medals, by 1977, Gibran's first significant effort relating to that medium was a bas relief portrait of his cousin for a monument sited in Copley Square across from the main branch of the Boston Public Library. Sculpting in wax led to several commissions, including bas reliefs Cardinal Richard Cushing, Amy Beach, Elliot Norton medal and portrait heads Karon, Najwa, Nureyev, Self Portrait. Finally he had the time and, as always, the passion to fulfill a childhood promise to honor his parents Rose Gibran (her maiden name) and Nicholas Gibran. In 1981, Gibran's monumental sculpture the 12 foot bronze Lady of the Cedars of Lebanon was placed on a high Jamaica Plain hill on a Roxbury puddingstone ledge, at the site of the Maronite Church to which the family belonged.  Later years = Inventing  The eighties and nineties brought more exposure to Gibran as a multi-faceted creator. Returning to drawing, his mixed media works were featured in several Boston- area galleries including the Cambridge Arts Association, Obelisk Gallery, Pierce Galleries, and the Copley Society where he became a Copley Master. By 1989, during a solo exhibit at Esthetix Gallery on Boston's State Street, the Boston Sunday Globe‚Äôs Mark Wilson characterized him as:Mark Wilson, ‚ÄúThe Tale of a Tripod\\", Boston Sunday Globe (May 7, 1989), p. 123 \\"A drawer, a painter, a collector, a photographer, a lens maker (he made his own 600 mm f/4.5 telephoto lens for his Nikon), a restorer of musical instruments, a craftsman, an inventor (he has new designs for a furnace, a shotgun shell and a screw driver) and an avid pool player. ‚ÄòI go to bed making pool shots in my head,‚Äô he says. ‚ÄòI play for the inner game.‚Äô ‚Äù Although he neglected to mention Gibran as jewelry maker and furniture designer, Wilson did describe the Gibran Tripod that he and Chris Casgrande began to manufacture and distribute to institutions, including The Museum of Modern Art gift shop. Like the pool cues he made, the leather belts he fashioned, Gibran‚Äôs design for this object was sleek and described as ‚Äúone brilliant new American product‚Äù that during its display at the German Photokina exhibit ‚Äúhad the French, the Germans, and the Italians slavering\\".Roger W. Hicks. ‚ÄúFinds for Photojournalists\\", Shutterbug, (December 1990) Vol. 20, No. 2, Issue 243, pp. 34, 36  Forest Hills Cemetery and donations  It was also during the late nineties that Gibran more or less left the competitive art world. Just steps away from his South End studio, West Canton Street Child presided over Hayes Park. For the first time in his life, he deliberately avoided publicity, explaining to one neighbor who successfully interviewed him: ‚ÄúI live in a world here that‚Äôs very different. When we bought this house I created sort of a haven, I equipped it with all the tools that I need, and it takes up all my time\\".Lee Dunn. ‚ÄúThe Expression of Experience: An Interview with Kahlil Gibran\\", The South End Historical Society Newsletter V. 25 no 2, (Spring 1996) pp 4-6 Within the vibrant South End art world, Gibran formed close ties with local artists including his Museum School classmate and member of the Boston art group Direct Vision Francesco Carbone, painter Steven Trefonides, and photographers Morton Bartlett, Marie Cosindas and David Robinson. Along with his studio, Boston's Forest Hills Cemetery had symbolized escape for Gibran ever since he was a boy roaming its rural paths. In Susan Wilson's Garden of Memories, he recalled how meaningful the space was: ‚ÄúForest Hills had a quiet solitude and magic...I walked through the gates, and it was MINE, all mine\\".Susan Wilson, Garden of Memories A Guide to Historic Forest Hills, Boston: Forest Hills Educational Trust, 1998, p. 109 At the turn of the 21st century shortly after the creation of his double-figure, Into the Millennium, Gibran became involved in the Forest Hills Educational Trust. His Seated Ceres joined other contemporary art on its Sculpture Path. Gibran gave Seated Ceres to the cemetery. It was featured in a New York Times slide show in January 2008, and its presence, seated on the shore of Lake Hibiscus, became a beloved icon.  Last years  Gibran's last four years were spent giving back to the community. The Jean and Kahlil Gibran Collection was shown at Framingham's Danforth Museum of Art in 2002. The exhibit included Gibran's many Boston colleagues ‚Äì often under-represented painters, photographers, and sculptors ‚Äì whom he and his wife had collected throughout the decades. The donation of these works to Danforth, a local museum that respects and continues to show neglected Boston artists, was soon followed by the couple's quest to find an eventual permanent home for their Gibran Kahlil Gibran archive of paintings, correspondence, and documents that they had carefully collected and nurtured. Helping and supporting this plan were long time friends, art historians, dealers, and writers Stuart and Beverly Denenberg. Publishing a confidential digital catalog of the Gibran Kahlil Gibran Collection, the Gibrans and Denenbergs determined that among the several institutions interested in acquiring the collection was Mexico City's Museo Soumaya, This institute provided the space, security, curatorial staff, scholars, and passion to care for the works and possessions of the poet. On October 21, 2007, the archive was placed in that museum's care. Shortly after, Jean and Kahlil Gibran made another special donation when their vast collection of European and American medals was accepted by the Los Angeles County Museum. A major exhibition of Gibran's work was shown at Boston's St. Botolph Club during September and October 2007. The curators of this retrospective As a Man/ Kahlil Gibran, selected forty-five examples, including paintings, musical instruments, sculpture, drawings, inventions, and books. With a stunning catalog, champagne toasts, and the violinist Joo-Mee Lee playing Gibran's violins, the opening reception resounded with applause. Stuart Denenberg read This Kahlil Gibran a praise poem honoring his friend of more than forty years.  Death and legacy  On April 13, 2008, at the age of 85, Gibran died suddenly of congestive heart failure at Massachusetts General Hospital. Obituaries also paid tribute. His final resting place at Forest Hills Cemetery was marked by Boy with a Dove the young figure from Into the Millennium. Exactly three months after his death, Seated Ceres was stolen from her Forest Hills site. Though stunned and horrified by this act of vandalism, Gibran's family and Forest Hills Educational Trust administrators collaborated to replace this figure with a Standing Ceres that was installed and dedicated on August 15, 2008 at a spot in the cemetery park that Gibran loved best. On April 26, 2014 Gibran's bronze sculpture Ad Astra was dedicated at Childe Hassam Park located on the corner of Columbus Avenue and Chandler Street in Boston's historic South End Neighborhood. Love Made Visible by Jean Gibran, with a foreword by critic Charles Giuliano and an afterword by Katherine French Director of the Danforth Museum, tells the story of Scenes from a Mostly Happy Marriage while paying tribute to the exciting Boston art scene that flourished in that city during last half of the 20th century. In January 2017, Interlink Press published Gibran's & his wife's revision of their biography of Gibran Kahlil Gibran. Kahlil Gibran Beyond Borders features more than 200 black and white and color illustrations related to the poet's life and received positive reviews including one by Magda Abu-Fadi from the Huffington Post. Articles about the sculptor still reveal his reputation as ‚ÄúGolden Hands.‚Äù Echoing the 2007 St. Botolph Catalogue that recorded his close friends‚Äô tributes to him is an essay by Joseph Steinfield published in July 2017.

The Boston Globe magazine featured him in 1967 when author Gregory McDonald concluded: ‚ÄúRemoving the confusion, the mysticism from the name Kahlil Gibran, leaves in this generation, a sculptor of extraordinary poetic power, utterly concerned with his art, with the double nature that is utterly human, as paradoxical as himself, and, a man with a singular future\\".Evan H.

Strong hopes based on a 5‚Äì0 start and a #6 ranking were dashed by a 36‚Äì3 blowout loss to Florida State and a third-place finish in the ACC. The Champs Sports Bowl typically took the fourth-place bowl eligible ACC team, but Virginia declined the bid as the game (played on December 21) would have conflicted with final exams. For a time the Independence Bowl was a possibility, as the Southeastern Conference (SEC) failed to produce enough bowl-eligible teams, but this was contingent on the MPC Computers Bowl getting a Big East school‚Äîeither Boston College, Connecticut or Syracuse‚Äîto replace an ACC team. The MPC Computers bowl normally had the sixth choice of ACC teams, which would have been Georgia Tech or Clemson. Clemson declined all bowl invitations after a season-ending brawl, while Georgia Tech took Virginia's place at the Champs Sports Bowl. The Big East declined to send a team to the MPC Computers Bowl, so on December 1 Virginia accepted the bid. Fresno State accepted a bid on December 1 as well, after finishing third in the Western Athletic Conference.

It was released in 2003. The film was shown in Indian Panorama section of IFFI during October 2002 in Delhi and Mumbai International Festival in 2003. It is the last instalment of his trilogy, the other two being Xagoroloi Bohu Door (1995) and Pokhi (1998). Konikar Ramdhenu depicts the horrors that happen in a juvenile home. Plot The story revolves around an imaginative and intelligent 11-year-old boy Kukoi (played by Ronik) who runs away from his village home and starts working in a motor garage in a city. One day the owner attempts to molest Kukoi. In self-defence, Kokoi hits the owner with an iron rod killing him on the spot. Kukoi is produced before court and then sent to state juvenile home where he is traumatized. Biswa Boro, the warden of the home, is an understanding man. He coaxes the boy into a confession of the true circumstances of the painful event. Kukoi is brought before the magistrate who orders his release and custody to his parents or any authorised guardian. Biswa goes to Kukoi's village where he discovers that the boy's mother died years ago and his stepfather has disowned him. Biswa, who is now retired and does not have children, decides to adopt Kukoi. Research Director Jahnu Barua visited 12 juvenile homes before making the film. He observed that out of 100 cases, more than 80 end up in \\"negative situations\\", much below expectations.

It arises in computer vision or robotics where the pose or transformation of an object can be used for alignment of a Computer-Aided Design models, identification, grasping, or manipulation of the object. From an uncalibrated 2D camera It is possible to estimate the 3D rotation and translation of a 3D object from a single 2D photo, if an approximate 3D model of the object is known and the corresponding points in the 2D image are known. A common technique for solving this has recently been \\"POSIT\\", where the 3D pose is estimated directly from the 3D model points and the 2D image points, and corrects the errors iteratively until a good estimate is found from a single image. Most implementations of POSIT only work on non-coplanar points (in other words, it won't work with flat objects or planes). Another approach is to register a 3D CAD model over the photograph of a known object by optimizing a suitable distance measure with respect to the pose parameters. The distance measure is computed between the object in the photograph and the 3D CAD model projection at a given pose. Perspective projection or orthogonal projection is possible depending on the pose representation used. This approach is appropriate for applications where a 3D CAD model of a known object (or object category) is available. From a calibrated 2D camera Given a 2D image of an object, and the camera that is calibrated with respect to a world coordinate system, it is also possible to find the pose which gives the 3D object in its object coordinate system. This works as follows.  Extracting 3D from 2D  Starting with a 2D image, image points are extracted which correspond to corners in an image. The projection rays from the image points are reconstructed from the 2D points so that the 3D points, which must be incident with the reconstructed rays, can be determined. Pseudocode The algorithm for determining pose estimation is based on the iterative closest point algorithm. The main idea is to determine the correspondences between 2D image features and points on the 3D model curve. (a) Reconstruct projection rays from the image points (b) Estimate the nearest point of each projection ray to a point on the 3D contour (c) Estimate the pose of the contour with the use of this correspondence set (d) goto (b) The above algorithm does not account for images containing an object that is partially occluded. The following algorithm assumes that all contours are rigidly coupled, meaning the pose of one contour defines the pose of another contour. (a) Reconstruct projection rays from the image points (b) For each projection ray R: (c) For each 3D contour: (c1) Estimate the nearest point P1 of ray R to a point on the contour (c2) if (n  1) choose P1 as actual P for the point-line correspondence (c3) else compare P1 with P: if dist(P1, R) is smaller than dist(P, R) then choose P1 as new P (d) Use (P, R) as correspondence set. (e) Estimate pose with this correspondence set (f) Transform contours, goto (b)  Estimating pose through comparison  Systems exist which use a database of an object at different rotations and translations to compare an input image against to estimate pose. These systems accuracy is limited to situations which are represented in their database of images, however the goal is to recognize a pose, rather than determine it.

Chuck is assigned to handle his first asset by General Beckman, while at the same time training new Nerd Herd employee Hannah. Plot summary=Main Plot While training Hannah on Nerd Herd procedures, Chuck is called away by Casey to attend a briefing in Castle. Beckman announces to the team that the Ring has transferred a sizable amount of money to a computer engineer named Manoosh (Fahim Anwar) and orders Chuck to gain his confidence to determine the nature of his work with the Ring. She has made arrangements that will force Manoosh to come to the Burbank Buy More, where Chuck is to make contact. Sarah has misgivings over whether Chuck is ready, but Casey is confident. Chuck, however, overplays his effort and botches the contact. The team makes a second attempt later that night at a local Mexican restaurant, where Chuck arranges an \\"accidental\\" meeting at the bar. After being coached through how to ingratiate himself with the asset by Sarah and Casey, Chuck manages to get Manoosh to divulge that he is working on a weapon. During the conversation, Manoosh is contacted on a Ring Communicator by his Ring handlers, who are closing in. Sarah takes over to accelerate things and tranquilizes him. Back at Castle, Chuck, Sarah and Casey examine Manoosh's briefcase, and find a suspicious object within. While Casey examines it, Chuck returns the briefcase to Manoosh‚Äîwho was earlier carefully released by the team to hide his actual whereabouts and is now waiting at the Buy More‚Äîso he can be on his way. Chuck is recalled to Castle in time to see Casey successfully break into the device, only to discover it is a decoy. Meanwhile, several Ring agents corner Manoosh near the Buy More's loading dock. Chuck and the team watch in surprise as he takes out a pair of sunglasses and flashes on advanced kung-fu. He quickly defeats his assailants and flees. Casey, Sarah, and Chuck conclude that the Ring contracted Manoosh to rebuild the Intersect from burned out components that they stole from a CIA facility. Manoosh is tracked to Weap-Con, the world's largest weapons convention, in Dubai and the team follows him. They watch from the audience as Manoosh demonstrates his Intersect device for several dignitaries and high-ranking military officers, then corner him backstage before an auction can be held for the technology. Chuck warns him not to proceed, and reveals his identity as a spy. However, before Manoosh can flee or the team can take action, several Ring agents intervene and capture the four. Chuck, Sarah and Casey are imprisoned, and Manoosh is threatened to turn over the device, but destroys his prototype thinking they will have to keep him alive. Before he can be killed, the team breaks out and confront Manoosh and the Ring agents, who are defeated. Chuck initially allows Manoosh to leave, but as his asset is walking out, tranquilizes him instead when he sees Casey about to do so for him. To protect him, Chuck turns Manoosh over to the custody of the government once they are back in Burbank. Casey acknowledges Chuck is becoming a spy but Sarah wonders aloud whether it's truly a good thing, while back at home Chuck turns to alcohol after being forced to \\"burn\\" his asset. Sarah has a flashback to the first day she met Chuck, she thought he would be a \\"piece of cake\\". Buy More and Family Chuck is attempting to train Hannah for her new job with the Nerd Herd. Jeff and Lester immediately take a liking to her and begin making advances, until Chuck and later Morgan, who has his own interest in Hannah, warn them to back off. Morgan later convinces Jeff and Lester into stalking her to learn as much about her as they can so he can make himself look better to her. Morgan is crushed when Hannah mentions Chuck's trip to Paris, as she believes it was an install and is unaware that no one else knows about it. Meanwhile, Devon is still recovering from his experience as a prisoner of the Ring. He is jumpy and hasn't been interested in exercising, and his relationship with Ellie is suffering due to his difficulties in lying to her, especially when Ellie finds a luggage claim ticket from Chuck's mission in Paris. Devon confronts Chuck about the situation, but hides when Ellie arrives as well to complain that Chuck didn't tell her about his trip. Devon is shocked and outraged at the ease with which Chuck lies to her about his trip being an install for a Buy More customer. Chuck also tells Ellie that he is sending her and Devon to Paris for a proper honeymoon, but Devon doesn't accept Chuck's explanation that he has to lie to keep them from witness protection. When Chuck later has tickets to Paris delivered to Ellie, Devon gets angry and demands Ellie refuse them as they \\"come with strings attached\\" before storming out again. Ellie runs into Morgan on the way out, and both lament about Chuck and Devon's strange behavior. Morgan promises to find out what's going on, and taps Jeff and Lester to spy on Chuck. Themes and Character Development The episode begins with a flashback to Chuck and Sarah's first meeting in \\"Chuck Versus the Intersect\\". From this point forward, much of the main plot centers around Sarah and Casey training Chuck on how to contact, manipulate, and handle an asset by using his likes and dislikes to ingratiate himself for whatever information they need. Once no longer needed, the asset is subsequently \\"burned\\". Dialogue throughout the episode notes the similarity of Manoosh to the place in his life where Chuck was prior to receiving the Intersect. A parallel is developed comparing Chuck's handling of Manoosh as an asset to Sarah's handling of Chuck as an asset at the beginning of the series. The lengths to which an agent goes to use their asset are highlighted by Chuck taking advantage of his knowledge of Manoosh's interests, and Sarah playing to Chuck's loneliness. The episode ends on a second flashback to Chuck and Sarah's first meeting, this time from Sarah's perspective upon first entering the store as she is briefed on Chuck by another agent over the phone, reinforcing the artificial nature of the asset-handler relationship. Production=Flashes *Manoosh flashes twice on advanced kung-fu using his glasses: Once to defend himself from Ring agents in the Buy More parking lot, and the second during a demonstration of the device. *Chuck uses a knife-pen as a throwing knife after flashing on a shuriken display during the fight at Weap-Con. *After another flash during the fight, Chuck uses a plate of nachos provided for Manoosh as a discus to save Sarah from a Ring agent. References to popular culture *The restaurant where Chuck attempts to receive information from Manoosh is called \\"Two and a Half Amigos\\", a reference to Two and a Half Men and Three Amigos *In the restaurant, Chuck is shown to be reading a copy of Y: The Last Man. Actor Zachary Levi who plays Chuck has been openly petitioning with strong fan support to play the lead character Yorick in the film adaptation. *In the restaurant where Chuck meets Manoosh, Sarah walks in and pretends to flirt with Manoosh. In the scene Sarah is wearing a shirt that says \\"frak off\\" which is a reference to the television show Battlestar Galactica, where the word \\"frak\\" is used as a curse in place of the word \\"fuck\\". *During the weapons convention, the team passes a salesman talking about the effectiveness of the \\"EM-50\\" mobile interrogation unit. This is a reference to the film Stripes, in which the EM-50 Urban Assault Vehicle was a military weapon disguised as an average camper van, just as Chuck is a weapon hidden within an ordinary person. *The weapons convention also features bikini-clad girls posing with guns and a PA announcement about a \\"Peacemaker demonstration\\". These are references to the cold-war comedy Deal of the Century. *When Casey says \\"Just like Bartowski. Bring a knife to a gun fight,\\" it is a reference to the film The Untouchables.

Whiting and with lyrics by Raymond B. Egan. The song was first popularized on Vaudeville by Nora Bayes, and then sold millions of copies as the B-side for the song \\"Whispering\\". Content The song is about a sandman from Japan, who exchanges yesterdays for tomorrows. The number has a very Oriental atmosphere, and is similar to many other songs from the interwar period that sing about a dreamy, exotic setting. Nora Bayes made a popular recording of the song in 1920. The song was Paul Whiteman's first record and sold over two million copies. It has been subsequently performed by several musical artists like Art Hickman, Benny Goodman, Bix Beiderbecke, Artie Shaw, Earl Hines, Paul Young, Django Reinhardt, the Andrews Sisters, Freddy Gardner, Freddy Sunder, and in 2010, a high-fidelity recording of Whiteman's historic arrangement, by Vince Giordano and his Nighthawks Orchestra. Additionally, the song was recorded by the Nazi German propaganda band Charlie and his Orchestra. For propaganda reasons, the lyrics were changed through references to the Japanese Empire. In popular culture *The song was often used in American cartoons from the 1930s to the 1940s, such as 1942's The Ducktators, usually to mock Japanese characters, due to the ongoing war between the United States and Imperial Japan. *An orchestral version is heard in the musical film Rose of Washington Square (1939), starring Alice Faye.\\"The Japanese Sandman\\" orchestral recording, audio file only, from Rose of Washington Square (1939) on YouTube *In the 1947 Disney cartoon \\"Cat Nap Pluto,\\" both Pluto and Figaro are visited by figurative \\"sandman\\" likenesses of themselves in coolie hats, seeking to bring on sleep.

Technology=General trends Technology began to outpace North American standards with Japanese vehicles often getting more miles per gallon than their North American rivals. People in Japan as well as the other oil-dependent nations of the world began to be dependent on high- speed rail networks (and other forms of mass transit like buses) as the price of gasoline began to skyrocket. The average price of gasoline at the end of the next decade would rise to $8/gallon on a national level; making it unaffordable for most Japanese people to drive long distances unless necessary. Since gasoline prices have risen significantly since the 1990s worldwide, it will be inevitable for gasoline prices to go up to $20/gallon within the course of the 21st century.When Gas Hits $20 Per Gallon After the 1990s ended and the 21st century began, Japanese residents (in addition to other people) will experience a return to local produce (through local farmers' markets instead of expensive grocery stores), increased use of renewable energy like wind energy and solar energy, the exodus from the exurbs to urban centers, more electric car sales, and a major shakeup of the airline industry. Video games While new gaming consoles like the Super Famicom and the Sony PlayStation flooded the market, most young people began to move in with their parents, and read manga.

Many video games were released during this decade (especially for the Super Famicom). Popular American titles like SimCity and SimEarth gained popularity for Japanese video gamers. The 1990s was also the era for Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy VI, and Final Fantasy VII. These games became multimillion-dollar blockbusters in Japan, Europe, and North America. However, the Famicom went into decline and most game companies halved their production of new 8-bit games by 1994. Even the Nintendo Game Boy acquired popularity in Japan (spawning a lineup of Japan-exclusive video games) and eventually the Japanese release of the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Nintendo Power wrote an expos√© about Japanese video games (using one of its first 50 issues). The expos√© stated that Japanese video games were less censored than their North American counterparts. Video games that were released in Japan employed some form of sexual content, brought forth the invocation of religious symbols, utilized a level of violence never seen in North American games (until the release of Doom in the mid-1990s), and mentioning tobacco in addition to alcohol so that the story could have more flavor. These uncensored Japanese games even used vulgar language. The Sega CD (known as the Sega Mega CD in Japan) first started to offer full motion video outside of the personal computer scene. It became trendy in the 1990s (and in the 2000s) for players to create their own role-playing video games. Game creation software like RPG Tsuk≈´ru: Super Dante and RPG Tsuk≈´ru 2 made it possible for players to create role-playing games on their Super Famicom systems. While these games were not as graphically enhanced as Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VI which dominated this decade for role-playing video games, these \\"game creation tools\\" would allow the gamers of the 1990s to become the game designers of the 2000s and beyond. Sequels like RPG Maker 2000 and RPG Maker XP provided that the original two software in the series were highly successful. Entertainment=Sports Ichiro Suzuki Professional wrestling continued to decline well into the 1990s like it did in the 1980s. Races often took place at either Suzuka Circuit or at Fuji Speedway. A NASCAR exhibition race was held in Motegi, Japan during the late 1990s in the hopes of getting people interested in stock car racing. During the 1990s, it became increasingly rare for Japanese businessmen to be able to play golf alongside their employers. Golf courses began closing up by the bundles and many young men (who would otherwise enter the workforce under a more ideal economy) began only to have golf experience from their years as a student. Besides the sporting aspect, golf was used in Japan in order to adapt to corporate culture. Hidetoshi Nakata The 1990s was also the decade that the American film Mr. Baseball was released; introducing an American audience to Japanese baseball. The Chunichi Dragons and the Yomiuri Giants became popular teams after the Mr. Baseball movie made mention of them. Nippon Professional Baseball was one of the sports to watch in Japan in addition to Formula One (featuring Japan's Satoru Nakajima who retired early in the 1990s but gained respect worldwide). The only perfect game of the 1990s for the Nippon Professional Baseball league came on May 18, 1994, with the Yomiuri Giants shutting out the Hiroshima Toyo Carp by a score of 6-0. Television and movies Mr. Children Anime like Dragon Ball Z (sh≈çnen) and Pok√©mon (sh≈çnen) developed an international audience after being created in Japan. Girl- oriented (sh≈çjo) anime like Sailor Moon also became of age during the 1990s. This show would be the inspiration for the 2000s anime Tokyo Mew Mew (known in North America as Mew Mew Power). J-Pop continued to be popular among Japanese female teenagers. Social Japanese Zodiac. Changes in the population of Japan Employment While people were losing their jobs, technology still was advancing at an exponential rate‚Äîmaking more jobs obsolete as new technologies replaced the old. Manufacturing jobs were being replaced with service sector jobs just like they were doing in the Western countries‚Äîleading to people being underemployed in either minimum wage or near-minimum wage jobs. There was some economic recovery after this decade; but the spending on cars and whiskey had not returned to the levels that were reached during the Japanese economic boom of the 1980s. Japan made up for the labor shortages in the 1990s by hiring temporary workers without security or job benefits. As of March 2010, the unemployment rate in Japan was 4.9%;https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100301/ap_on_bi_ge/as_japan_economy Japan's Unemployment Rate - March 2010 a very low number compared to the unemployment rate during the height of the Lost Decade. Population decline The 1990s would be the final decade where the birth rate in Japan would exceed the death rate. This is despite consistent attempts of government agencies throughout this decade to encourage procreation through targeted seductive advertising and media campaigns. However, the rest of the world's population will increase slowly until 2040 reaching 9 billion people.World Population Clock ‚Äî Worldometers The population of the world will eventually reach 9,202,458,484 people by the year 2050.Data from U.S. Census Bureau, International Data Base Estimates updated December 2009. Retrieved on January 21, 2010 This would become the world's highest population ever in recorded history; It has been suggested that the population of Japan will fall from over 100 million in the 1990s to a mere 50 million by the year 2090. However, the most recent rise in the national birth rate of Japan happened on February 2007. Japan will see a 0.9% decline of their population after the year 2025‚Äîlowering their labor force while countries like Canada will see a rise in their labor force by that same year. Terrorism Anti-Aum Shinrikyo protest in Japan. The Tokyo subway sarin attack, usually referred to in the Japanese media as the Subway Sarin Incident (Âú∞‰∏ãÈâÑ„Çµ„É™„É≥‰∫ã‰ª∂ Chikatetsu Sarin Jiken?), was an act of domestic terrorism perpetrated on March 20, 1995, in Tokyo, Japan by members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult. In five coordinated attacks, the perpetrators released sarin on several lines of the Tokyo subway, killing 13 people, severely injuring 50 and causing temporary vision problems for nearly 1,000 others. The attack was directed against trains passing through Kasumigaseki and Nagatach≈ç, home to the Japanese government. It was the most serious attack to occur in Japan since the end of World War II.

The film is notable for helping to establish the then-nascent French language production unit at the National Film Board of Canada, and more importantly, the development of a uniquely Quebec style of direct cinema. The film incorporates agile camera work and a largely synchronous soundtrack, uninterrupted by any narration, in keeping with the ethos of direct cinema to avoid any imposed \\"truth\\" on events onscreen. Production Grant McLean, then head of production for the NFB, had been angry that what was to have been a three- minute vignette had quadrupled in length and ordered the film to be used for stock footage.

This film is the remake of 2007 Tamil movie Sivi (film) which is itself a remake of 2004 Thai horror film Shutter. Plot Avinash ‚ÄúAvi‚Äù Mehra is an ace photographer who is in a live-in relationship with Sonia, a model. One night while returning from a party, the couple accidentally hit a young girl with their speeding car. As Sonia was driving the car, to avoid further complications, Avi insists on them fleeing from the accident scene. But trouble starts for the couple soon after. While strange white marks begin to appear in Avi's photos, Sonia starts having spooky experiences. Avi also develops a severe neck pain and even though he does not appear to be overweight, a scale reveals that he weighs 120 kilograms (264.6 pounds). Avi, too, starts having experiences similar to Sonia's. The couple is petrified when all of Avi's best friends commit suicide in a similar manner. It then comes to light that the spirit haunting them all has a connection to Avi's college life. Meanwhile, Sonia finds out that Avi was friends with a girl named Aarti Kaushik during his college days. As Avi and Sonia are still being haunted by Aarti they go and visit her, but realize that Aarti is dead, having apparently committed suicide by using a knife. Aarti's mother believes that she is still alive, thinking that she is merely ill and will recover. On the way home Aarti continues to haunt Avi and Sonia, and again during the night at the hotel she also haunts Avi in his sleep, ending up with him being thrown off the fire escape. Later Avi is in the hospital and Sonia tells him that Aarti will be cremated, and they visit her funeral before returning to their home town. Sonia finds some photos of Aarti, where she is crawling to get something. As she follows the pattern indicated by Aarti, Sonia discovers that Avi's best friends (who later committed suicide) are raping Aarti. When Sonia talks to Avi about this dark secret, he tells her that he only wanted Aarti to understand his feelings, but that when his best friends tried to talk to her, Aarti hurt Avi's friend Tarun, who became angry and with his friends raped her. Avi claims that when he entered the room he was shocked at the scene and tried to help her, but that Tarun then said that Avi had asked them to rape her as a way of avoiding jail, and accused Avi of planning to do this to her and having one of Avi's friends taking the pictures. Avi then tells Sonia that the reason he kept the photos was to remind him that he failed to protect Aarti and say he is the guilty one. But Sonia leaves him and wishes him that Aarti may forgive him. Later on Avi attempts to kill himself in the same way his best friends did, but as a Polaroid camera clicks towards him, he sees Aarti sitting on his shoulders. Avi is suddenly thrown through the window, and ends up in hospital, where it is revealed that the reason why she was sitting on his shoulders was that Aarti had still loved Avi. As Sonia makes another photograph of Avi, she speaks to Aarti, asserting that one day she will let go as the reflection in the mirror shows Aarti still leaning on Avi's back.

There is a row of dark and/or pale spots along the midbody and commonly a series of short, pale bar-like marking extending down from the top of the dorsal fin. The first spine of the anal fin is large and grooved like a fountain pen point. It has a continuous dorsal, tail and anal fins, but no ventral fins. The tail is defined by slightly longer rays. The anal fin is about half the length of the dorsal fin. The penpoint gunnel is mainly found in intertidal areas at depths of . It can sometimes be seen in tide pools, also in eelgrass beds, sea lettuce beds, and in stands of kelp. It commonly takes on the color of the vegetation it inhabits. If there is no vegetation (in winter, for example), it can also inhabit rocky areas, lurking under rocks and in protective crevices. However, it can also remain out of the water under rocks or seaweeds. The penpoint gunnel can breathe air when out of water. Penpoint gunnels feed on small crustaceans and mollusks. Pairs are found coiled around egg masses.

In May 1998 Gentians service as a black-hull buoy tender ended. She was temporarily decommissioned, repainted white and refurbished to facilitate longer periods of time at sea. Then in September 1999 she was recommissioned as WIX-290, and assigned to Miami, Florida where she trained sailors from all over the world.

Her current research is focused on understanding the mechanism that miR-34 plays in tumor suppression. Her lab is also studying the miR-17/92 family. Differential expression of this microRNA cluster has been observed in B-cell lymphomas, suggesting that miR-17/92 members are potential human oncogenes. Her work has appeared in Nature, Nature Genetics, and Science. Awards Lin He received the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship in 2009.

In addition to Rancho Lompoc, the More brothers owned the adjacent Rancho Mission Vieja de la Purisma and Rancho Santa Paula y Saticoy, Santa Rosa Island and Rancho Sespe.

The building was proposed by Manuel Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez in 1787 and approved by Charles III of Spain. Work began in 1791 under the direction of administrador general of Customs Pedro Ortega Monroy and architects Miguel del Castillo and Ildefonso Valc√°rcel, who designed the principal fa√ßade and floor plans. Work was still under way in 1810 when the building was sacked during the occupation of M√°laga by French forces during the Peninsular War; after the war, damage was repaired and construction continued. Architect Pedro Nolasco Ventura made various modifications to the plans, and the building was completed in 1829.

As of 2004, it was being used by the Subdelegation, and the Polic√≠a Nacional, and to store the collection of the Fine Arts section of the Museo de M√°laga, which lost its previous site in the Buenavista Palace when that was taken over by the Museo Picasso M√°laga. The original roof was destroyed by a fire in the tobacco factory era. On 25‚Äì26 April 1922, while functioning as the seat of the government, the building experienced a terrible fire. The wooden staircases to the top floor caught fire; at the time, there were 70 government functionaries living on that floor. 28 people died, and years of archives were destroyed. The building is currently (as of February, 2012) being rehabilitated for permanent museum use by the Museo de M√°laga.

Since 2010, she can not participate in any official exhibitions in Uzbekistan. Work As a photographer she has participated in exhibitions addressing urban and rural issues and has collaborated on film and book projects including the presentation of the short film The Burden of Virginity. As an Associated Press photographer, her images have been published in the photography sections of the online editions of The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and The Globe and Mail. As a photojournalist and artist she has worked onprojects dedicated to exploring issues of human rights. In the course of her work she has documented the traditions, disparate cultures and everyday events in the modern borders of Uzbekistan. Umida Akhmedova is one of the most prominent representatives of the Uzbek photography. Arrest and criminal charges On November 17, 2009 she was summoned by Nodir Akhmadzhan, investigator of the Tashkent city police department and accused of defamation and of \\"insult and slander of the Uzbek nation.\\" These charges against her and others are due in part to participation on a project sponsored by the Swiss Embassy Gender Program. One of the works, Women and men: from dawn till dusk documents aspects of life in rural Uzbekistan. On December 16, 2009, criminal charges were filed against her due to her involvement in the aforementioned project as well as other gender and human rights media projects including The Burden of Virginity, about difficulties faced by women in Uzbekistan. The criminal charges carry a possible sentence of prison for up to six months, or 2‚Äì3 years of forced labor and she is currently banned from leaving the country. In January 2010 she was accused of slander, allegedly \\"insulting the Uzbek people\\" after she produced her book portraying rural Uzbekistan and Uzbek traditions. She was charged on January 13, after an expert panel of 'specialists in the fields of religious affairs, spirituality, and psychology' found that her images portrayed Uzbekistan in a negative light to Western audiences: \\"a foreigner who has never been to Uzbekistan, but who is familiar with this album, would reach the conclusion that [Uzbekistan] is a country where people live in the Middle Ages\\"\\"Uzbek photographer 'slanders' her people, government says\\" In February 2010 she was found guilty of slandering and insulting the Uzbek people, but could walk away free.

The tips of young flowering shoots wilt before they flower. Fruit that forms on the plant can then be infected by the asexual spores traveling through the plant, causing the berries to harden, turn cottony on the inside, and dry out instead of maturing. The berries are filled with a cotton-like fungus and are generally yellowish with tan stripes or blotches at maturity, making them unmarketable. It results in important economic impacts on many cranberry marshes, particularly in Wisconsin. Distribution Cottonball occurs on cranberry marshes in the Pacific Northwest and southeastern Canada, but is more common in Wisconsin. The disease has become much more problematic in Wisconsin since the 1970s ‚Äúfor reasons that are not known.‚Äù Typically 2 to 10% of fruit in diseased beds is infected; if left unchecked the amount can exceed 40%. Cottonball has been observed on all of the popular cranberry varieties in Wisconsin. Signs and symptoms When young cranberry shoots become infected, they show ‚Äútip blight‚Äù symptoms: shoot tips shrivel and a tan discoloration spreads from the tip of the shoot down the stem and into leaves. Cottonball tip blight differs from other shoot diebacks, in that tan V- or U-shaped lesions can be observed centered on the leaf midvein. Also, white, powdery conidia (asexual spores) appear on diseased shoots just before and during bloom. Tip blight of cottonball is often inconspicuous and is easily overlooked. Immature diseased berries show no external symptoms, but are filled with white, cotton-like fungus. While healthy berries turn red as they mature, diseased berries may acquire a red blush but are generally yellowish with tan stripes or botches. Diseased fruit are unfit for fresh or processing markets. Dried-up remains of diseased fruit contain sclerotia and are commonly called ‚Äúmummies.‚Äù The ‚Äúmummies‚Äù are roughly spherical and about ¬Ω inch in diameter. In the spring, tan or brown mushroom-like structures (apothecia) about 1-2 inches tall grow from the mummies. ‚Äú'Mummies' and apothecia are difficult to spot.\\" Disease cycle Monilinia species attack various Ericaceae hosts. M. oxycocci on cranberry exhibits a disease cycle similar to other species and is characterized by two distinct phases: infection of shoots (tip blight), and secondary infection of flowers (leading to fruit rot). Fruit rot only results from the infection of flowers during bloom. About the time of budbreak in the spring, apothecia develop from overwintered pseudosclerotia‚Äîthe hardened, dried-out ‚Äúmummified‚Äù remains of previously diseased fruit. Mummies are typically spherical and approximately 0.5 inches in diameter. Apothecia are generally 1 to 2 inches tall. These apothecia discharge ascospores over 10‚Äì14 days. Ascospores infect succulent young developing shoots (0.5 ‚Äì 1.5 inches long), causing tip blight. This is the primary infection. Come bloom (about 3‚Äì4 weeks after primary infection), conidia are produced on the infected shoots and are dispersed to infect open flowers. Conidia borne either by wind or insect deposition may land on the flower stigma, germinate, grow down the style, and colonize the ovary. This is the secondary infection. Within the ovary, fungal mycelia form a white cottony mass in each of the four locules, or fruit seed cavities, and grow into the fleshy fruit tissue. The infected berry itself remains firm, categorizing this type of rot as a hard rot (a soft rot is characterized by total tissue maceration and seepage). Eventually, the fungus consumes the fruit pericarp and a hard black pseudosclerotium (mummy) develops from 25 ‚Äì 50% of the diseased fruit. Mature pseudosclerotia often float and may be dispersed by harvest or cold protection floods. The fungus will overwinter in these mummies‚Äîwhich can be difficult to detect‚Äîat or near the soil surface. Wet conditions in the spring stimulate apothecia growth and the cycle moves forward. Berries without pseudosclerotia decompose by the next spring. Environment Fruit rot fungi thrive in extended wet conditions. It has been suggested that incidence of disease is greatest when there are prolonged wet periods during the maturing apothecia phase, rainy spells during bloom, and an abundance of mummified berries. Ditches where dense moss is growing and areas where recently applied sand is saturated for an extended time are ideal sites for more severe cases of tip blight. Further studies have shown that the temperature of the duff and upper canopy within the bed, in addition to relative humidity, correlate best with the constant presence of airborne ascospores during peak dispersal time. These variables (temperature and moisture) along with wind speed are factors in the constant presence of airborne conidia during peak dispersal time. The intensity of conidia showers directly relates to the percentage of bloom and shoots with primary infection symptoms. However, no clear pattern of environmental events has been noted to account for the initiation of peak spore dispersal periods. Management Many cottonball-infected fruit and mummies are removed during harvest. Because they float, some growers have found that reflooding beds after harvest is a good way to remove cottonball mummies and other pests. Good drainage is another important tool for limiting the spread of the disease by limiting the ability of spores to travel in water on the soil surface. Fungicides have been used since the 1990s to control cottonball. Orbit (propiconazole) is the most effective fungicide available. Spray recommendations depend on the previous year's disease pressure. \\"If disease pressure was low to moderate (fewer than 15 % of berries infected), two fungicide applications are recommended: one at 10 - 20% bloom and again 7 - 10 days later. If disease pressure was high in the previous year (greater than 15% of berries infected), two additional fungicide applications are recommended: one when about half the shoots have started to elongate and the second 7 - 10 days later.\\" Experiments have shown that bloom sprays are especially important, and unless disease pressure is high, spraying during shoot elongation appears to be unnecessary. No negative impacts on bees, yield, berry size, or berry color have been observed when Orbit was applied during bloom. Control of cottonball is the main reason for fungicide use in cranberry production. Economic impact Typically 2-10% of fruit in diseased beds is infected and becomes unmarketable. Wisconsin is the largest producer of cranberries in the United States (it is Wisconsin's state fruit). In 2010, Wisconsin produced 3.96 million barrels of cranberries, representing nearly 60% of the nation's crop. Cranberries contribute nearly $300 million annually in Wisconsin, and support approximately 3,400 jobs in the state. Even relatively small amounts of cottonball infections can have a dramatic effect on producers' incomes.

After all, no one understood his language (III. 11. 9‚Äì10, III. 14. 37‚Äì40, V. 10. 35‚Äì36), and when they heard Latin words they laugh (10. 37‚Äì38). Ovid also complains about constant wars (III. 10. 53‚Äì70, V. 10. 21‚Äì26; Ep. I. 2. 13‚Äì14) and the harsh climate, with cold, snow and ice (III. 8. 27‚Äì32, V. 2. 63‚Äì66; Ep.

However, with its cultured man standing before barbarous people, the 1859 picture show the Scythians treating the poet with sympathy and curiosity, and is a fine treatment of the theme of civilisation confronted with barbarity.Gilles N√©ret, Eug√®ne Delacroix, 1798‚Äì1863: the prince of romanticism (Taschen, 2000), p.81-82. , Henri Loyrette wrote: The first version was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1859, the last in which Delacroix participated. The composition reinterprets ideas that Delacroix had previously used in decorative compositions such as The Massacre at Chios, Death of Sardanapalus and Entry of the Crusaders in Constantinople. At the time of its exhibition, the landscape with its mountains was \\"universally\\" praised, while the mare in the foreground was thought strange by some.L. Jourdan: Les Peintres fran√ßais, Salon de 1859, Paris [1859], p.35.

Astrug: Les 14 statins de Salon ‚Äì 1859, Paris [1859], pp.260‚Äì61.

Also quoted by Alexander Sturgis, Rebels and martyrs: the image of the artist in the nineteenth century (Yale University Press, 2006), p.18. , The wildness and the misunderstood genius were key concepts in Romanticism and are very well portrayed in these two paintings by Delacroix.Matt Cartmill, A View to a Death in the Morning: Hunting and Nature Through History, Harvard University Press, 1996, p.118-19. The second version, contrary to what one might think, is not an oil sketch but a completed version which develops many elements of the London work. Delacroix painted it with more vivid colors, replaced the barbarian with a shield on the back by a woman bringing food, and also closely integrated the figures and landscape in a manner that is more in keeping with a historical landscape.Barth√©l√©my Jobert, Delacroix, Paris, 1997, p.268.

Inadine is produced by Systagenix. It was previously made by Johnson & Johnson. It is a thin dressing that comes sandwiched between backing papers. It is applied directly to a recently cleaned wound or even over necrotic tissue with no underlying treatment. The dressing itself does not have adherent properties apart from the ability to absorb some moisture or blood, and is typically held in place using gauze and then bandage material. The dressing is a topical wound dressing containing an ointment of 10% povidone-iodine or PVP-I. The dressing contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and purified water as inactive components. The povidone polymer provides a sustained release of iodine. The polyethylene glycol provides a moist environment allowing the iodine to reach the bacteria in the wound. PVP-I is the broadest spectrum antiseptic for human use and has no reported cases of acquired resistance and is therefore a very effective bactericide. The dressing may be quite difficult to apply to areas such as fingers as it has a tendency not to adhere easily by itself by design, and will require incisions and shaping. Once applied, it will conform to the shape correctly when dressed over. It is very effective at preventing bacterial infection. After a few days the dressing has a tendency to dry out, and must be changed often. Left on too long, it can engage with wound tissue and wound secretions when drier, and be more difficult to remove. A few drops of saline will normally free this up as with most dressings.

He was involved in an unsuccessful plot to assassinate his cousin the Emperor Commodus, which led to his execution afterwards. Offices Quadratus Annianus held included legate to the proconsul of Africa, and consul ordinarius in 167 with the emperor Lucius Aurelius Verus.Syme, \\"The Ummidii\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 17 (1968), pp. 99-102  Life  Quadratus Annianus was the son of Marcus Aurelius‚Äô sister, Annia Cornificia Faustina and an unnamed Senator. Ronald Syme identifies him with one of the suffect consuls in 146, recorded in the Fasti Ostienses as Gaius Annianus Verus, but having the full name of Gaius Ummidius Quadratus Annianus Verus. He was descended from one of the leading aristocratic and political influential families in Rome and was a direct descendant of the late suffect consul Gaius Ummidius Durmius Quadratus.Syme, \\"The Ummidii\\", pp. 98f Through his mother, Quadratus Annianus was related to the ruling Nerva‚ÄìAntonine dynasty. His sister was Ummidia Cornificia Faustina. His mother had died sometime between 152 and 158. At her death, Quadratus Annianus and Cornificia Faustina divided their mother‚Äôs property, making them both very wealthy.Sigrid Mratschek-Halfmann, Divites et praepotentes. Reichtum und soziale Stellung in der Literatur der Prinzipatszeit (Dissertation, Historia Einzelschriften, Bd. 70). Steiner, Stuttgart 1993, , p. 110 After his mother‚Äôs death, Quadratus took a mistress, a Greek freedwoman named Marcia, who would later become the emperor Commodus' mistress. Following his consulship, Quadratus adopted the first son of the Senator and philosopher Gnaeus Claudius Severus, who then assumed the name Marcus Claudius Ummidius Quadratus. The reason for the adoption is unknown. When Marcus Aurelius died in 180, Quadratus' maternal cousin Commodus succeeded him as emperor. Commodus‚Äô sister Lucilla was not happy living as a quiet, private citizen in Rome and became jealous of her brother and her sister-in-law. Further, she became very concerned at Commodus' erratic behavior. In 182, Lucilla, her daughter Plautia, and her nephew-in-marriage Quintianus, along with Quadratus, his adopted son, and Cornificia Faustina, planned to assassinate Commodus and replace him with Lucilla and her second husband, the consul Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus Quintianus. The involvement of Quadratus, his adopted son and his sister can be explained by a possible dynastic dispute with Commodus, or a possible romantic relationship between Quadratus and Lucilla. Quintianus burst from his place of hiding with a dagger, trying to stab Commodus. He said to him, \\"Here is the dagger the senate sends to you\\", giving away his intentions before he had the chance to act. The guards were faster than he was, and overpowered him. The conspirators were soon revealed; the emperor ordered the deaths of Quadratus Annianus, his adopted son and Quintianus. Commodus may have confiscated Quadratus Annianus‚Äô property and fortune. Lucilla, her daughter, and Cornificia Faustina were banished to the Italian island of Capri. Later that year the Emperor sent a centurion to Capri to execute the three women.

The oldest examples of carbon-based tattooing discovered to date appear as 61 marks on the body of the 5,300 year old Tyrolean ice mummy known as √ñtzi, discovered in 1991 near Similaun mountain and Hauslabjoch on the border between Austria and Italy. This is also believed to be the oldest example of all human tattooing. Skin samples from several of the Iceman's tattoos were examined by researchers using optical microscopes, bright field transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS), energy filtering TEM (EFTEM) and electron diffraction. This work determined that √ñtzi's tattoos were created using carbon-base pigments derived from soot and ash. Microscopic quartz crystals identified among the carbon particles are believed to have originated from stones around the fireplace where the carbon was collected.

It was intended to be used for home movie making. History The first prototype was a leather covered rectangular wooden box, which evolved into a final cast aluminum box approximately 8.5\\" by 5\\" by 3\\", and was cranked by hand at two turns per second to achieve the necessary 16 frames per second. Hand cranking meant that a tripod was essential to achieve a steady image. The camera was equipped with a fixed 1-inch (25mm) lens. Early in 1924 a battery-powered electric motor attachment was introduced, but discontinued in 1926, at which time an improved version of the camera with an interchangeable Kodak Anastigmat f/1.9 lens was introduced. The lens focal range was 2 to 50 feet and INF (infinity).Instructions for use of Cine-Kodak Model B f.1.9 (10-1927) The only additional lens offered was a 78mm f/4.5 telephoto. With the discontinuation of the motor, additional crank accessories were introduced: one for single frames, and one with a 4:1 gear ratio for slow motion work. In 1925, Kodak followed with a spring motor-driven Cin√©-Kodak Model B, at which time the original Cin√©-Kodak was re-designated as Model A, though that designation was not added to the camera nameplate until November 1929. A full winding of the spring would run the motor for about fifteen to twenty feet of film.Instructions for use of Cine-Kodak Model B f.1.9 (10-1927) Special Editions of the Model B were released with ostrich leather covering the camera body and carrying case. Production of Model A ceased in 1930; the Model B in 1931. In 1929, a Model BB for 50-ft reels and an additional 8 frames/second speed was introduced, followed by the Model K in 1930, which was an enlarged BB for 100-ft reels. The Model K was joined briefly by a stripped-down Model M, but the latter camera did not sell well since it lacked some of the very features that made the Model K appealing. In 1933, the Cin√©-Kodak Special was introduced for advanced amateur and semi-professional work, and quickly became popular with professionals for its vast range of capabilities. Later in the 1930s a new universal Kodak S-mount was introduced with this camera. The Cin√©- Kodak Special II was introduced in 1948 with a diverging turret to allow for mounting a longer second lens without interfering with the field of view of the shorter focal length, but was otherwise unchanged from the Special. The Special was discontinued in the early 1960s, although a Reflex Special was available until late in the decade. In 1937, the Model E was introduced with a shape similar to the later Path√© Webo camera and provided slow motion speeds and an internal viewfinder instead of the open frame types used hitherto. The final 16mm spool loading Cin√©-Kodak, the K100, arrived in 1956 with both turret and non-turret versions. The mid-1930s saw the beginning of a line of magazine-loading cameras, the Magazine Cin√©-Kodaks, made initially in Kodak's Nagel Works in Germany. The 16mm Cin√©-Kodaks were well-made, long-lived cameras. Most have double claws and double sprockets and hence require double perf (2R) film in unmodified form. The exceptions are both the Specials and K100 models that were designed for single perf (1R) film, which allowed for the addition of sound tracks. 8mm Cameras The Cin√©-Kodak brand was also applied to the double run 8mm cameras introduced by Kodak in 1932 beginning with the Eight Twenty model.

In June 1914, a Huertista gunboat sank a Constitutionalist gunboat off Topolobampo, Sinaloa in the Gulf of California. Background After the Third Battle of Topolobampo and the first sinking of the Constitutionalist gunboat Tampico, rebel sailors under Captain Hilario Malpica raised their ship, which had been partially submerged behind Shell Point, at the mouth of Topolobampo Bay. Several United States Navy ships were in the area, observing the campaign. Flagship USS California, , and were all present and were under the Pacific Fleet commander Rear Admiral Thomas B. Howard in California. was also in the area. Much of the campaign is remembered by Rear Admiral Howard's and his officer's reports of the battles. On June 11, 1914, Tampico was sighted by Howard when off Mazatl√°n while commanding his flagship. On Sunday, June 14, 1914, Howard received a report that Tampico was steaming away from Topolobampo to Altata. He ordered the destroyer USS Preble, under Lieutenant Junior Grade Vance Duncan Chapline, to find Tampico and follow her. Preble immediately got underway at about 3:30 pm. From Mazatl√°n, she steamed north toward Topolobampo. The destroyer Perry, which was off La Paz, was ordered to head for Topolobampo and report to Preble for further instructions with her radio. Prebles commander, did not know what course or speed Tampico was making, so he slowly proceeded to Topolobampo, hoping to sight the ship at around daylight the next morning. At roughly 7:30 am on June 15, Tampico was sighted to the west at latitude 25¬∞ 14' north, longitude 109¬∞ 01' west. Preble approached to within two miles of Tampico and stopped. Tampicos crew spotted Preble and also stopped. A few moments later, a lifeboat was dropped and a Mexican officer named Rebatet boarded Preble and presented the compliments of Captain Malpica. Rebatet also told Lieutenant Chapline how Tampico had been underwater for two months as result of the third action off Topolobampo. On June 14, Tampico left Topolobampo under one boiler and proceeded to sea en route to Altata, Mexico. There Captain Malpica expected to retube Tampicos boilers and improve the quality of her machinery. A map of Topolobampo Bay and surroundings. From there, Malpica's mission would be to attack the Huerista gunboat Guerrero, operating out of Guaymas. After destroying the Guerrero, Tampico would begin a commerce raiding campaign against targets along the west coast of Mexico. Tampico had steamed only thirty miles when her one remaining boiler had burned out of action, rendering the Constitutionalist saliors stranded with no means of propulsion. Repairs to the boiler were attempted, but proved fruitless, eventually Captain Malpica requested that the American destroyer tow Tampico into Altata, eighty miles away. By this time, USS Perry had arrived, so Lieutenant Chapline was forced to deny Malpica's request, as doing so would have violated American neutrality. The Mexicans then asked Chapline to send a radio message to Rear Admiral Howard. Captain Malpica also asked if Prebles commander would come to see him. Prebles radioman sent the message as requested. At about 5:30 pm, Chapline boarded Tampico. At the time, Malpica's leg was covered in bandages; a week or so earlier, he had accidentally fired his revolver into his foot and could barely walk during the final battle. The captain was happy to learn that a message had been sent to Rear Admiral Howard and invited the Americans to inspect the poor condition Tampico was in. The U.S. Navy officers inspected the Mexican gunboat, which was armed with two guns, two guns and one machine gun on the bridge. Tampico had a raised deck forward and aft, each of which mounted one of the 4-inch rapid-fire guns. Four other 6-pounder guns were originally part of Tampicos armament, but they had been removed before the campaign. The rebels expected trouble with the 4-inch guns; upon examination, the Americans discovered that their breech block hinges were loose, the rifling badly eroded, and much movement was lost as a result of the training- and elevating-gears, being covered in filth from being underwater. Furthermore, the rear gun sights could not be lined up with the front sights. The two 6-pounders appeared to be in fine condition. About 100 to 200 4-inch armor-piercing, blind and shrapnel shells were available, but most were weathered though due to exposure to the elements or from being submerged in Topolobampo Bay. The 6-pounders had plenty of ammunition, but again the shells were in bad shape and dangerous to fire. Crates of small arms ammunition littered the vessel, some whole and filled with ammo, others splintered to pieces. The whole crates were stacked on the bridge and inside the captain's quarters. Among the debris, three cows roamed the hold, adding to the mess. The engines were in a bad state, covered in rust. The generator had been destroyed by salt water, meaning no lights could be used and Tampicos crew had to use lanterns at night. The two boilers were \\"dead\\"; the fronts of the casings were missing, along with the hand-hole plates. Tubes inside the boilers were visible; salt crystals hung from them - the steam piping, the fresh-water piping, and the gauges. About 500 tubes needed plugging, according to the Mexican engineers. The rebels improvised with wooden table legs to plug the holes. Many of Tampicos crew wore bandages over their wounds from previous engagements. Beside Captain Malpica, the crew consisted an executive officer, a chief engineer, and an assistant engineer with three machinists. Twenty-nine sailors were aboard, with a reinforcement of twenty-five rebel soldiers, to make up for the missing Tampico crew members, for a total of sixty-one men. The American captain informed Malpica that a radio response from Howard was not likely to happen that day, so the U.S. sailors went back to their ship. Tampico would be sunk before the Americans received a response. Guerrero was armed with six 4-inch guns and had an unknown number of crewmen. She was commanded by Captain Navio Torres of the Mexican Navy. When the American commander asked Malpica what he would do when he encountered Guerrero, he replied, \\"I'll fight her and sink her if she will only come within range of my guns.\\" At 8:00 pm that night, Chapline intercepted a radio communique from USS New Orleans, under Commander Noble E. Irwin, to Rear Admiral Howard. The message stated that New Orleans was shadowing Guerrero as she headed south from Guaymas straight for Tampico. With this information, the Americans were able to estimate when Guerrero and New Orleans would arrive: around 7:00 am the following morning. Tampico was in terrible shape for her last battle; also, sometime during the same night of June 15, she drifted over a shoal and ran aground. It was at this position, latitude 25¬∞ 28' 30\\" north, longitude 109¬∞ 18' west, that Guerrero would sink Tampico for a final time. Perry and Prebbles commanders were ordered to simply wait for Guerrero and New Orleans and to report every event of the battle, but assist neither side. This meant that the Americans were not able to warn Tampico of the incoming Guerrero, as it apparently would violate their neutrality. Battle Just before daylight, June 16, 1914, the two American destroyers and Tampico sighted two fast- approaching vessels to the north. The weather was well, clear skies and warm air with just a slight breeze; the California Gulf was very calm. At around 5:30 am the two ships were identified as Guerrero and USS New Orleans. Guerrero came to a halt and cleared for action and at about 7:00 am, began her advance towards Tampico. Tampicos Mexican National Ensign was hoisted and life boats lowered on the unengaged starboard side, reportedly the only preparations the rebels made before the action. The Huerista gunboat raised her flag, which was identical to Tampicos but a little smaller. Tampico commenced the action at 7:47 am by firing her 4-inch guns at the now stationary Guerrero. Tampicos shots fell short and Guerrero fired back with one gun; her shots hit the water over Tampico. A gunnery battle at a range of continued for many moments. The crews of the American vessels were very excited according to Lieutenant Chapline and predominantly in favor of Tampico, not because of the political situation but because the Americans knew of Tampicos poor condition. The Americans covered the decks of their ships and climbed onto the rigging to observe with binoculars. Whenever one of Tampicos shells fell near Guerrero, the Americans would cheer and whenever Tampico was hit they would groan and criticize the bad gunnery of both Tampico and Guerrero. The battle initially continued for about an hour before either side made any hits. The American quartermaster aboard Preble joked by saying that \\"Those boobs on the Tampico will starve to death before the Guerrero hits her.\\" Tampico in 1908 Throughout the engagement, Preble steamed back and forth, in between the two fighting Mexican gunboats. Whenever the Guerrero came about the Americans would follow each of her movements but never interfered as they remained one to two miles away from Guerrero at all times. Eventually most of Tampicos guns were in action, her two 4-inch guns and starboard 6-pounder. The machine gun mounted on the bridge was never used, as was the same for the portside 6-pounder. Guerrero never came within range of small arms and never maneuvered to Tampicos port; she used all of her 4-inch guns. Lieutenant Chapline ordered a yeoman to stand near him during the action, with a stopwatch, pad and pencil. The yeoman's orders were to write down every event and the times in which they occurred. The gunnery of both Mexican gunboats was reported as being very \\"erratic\\". Later during the battle, while observing Tampico, the crew of Preble discovered that the Constitutionalist gunners would actually line up for a shot on Guerrero, then lie down and pull the firing lanyard, making no attempt to properly aim the guns. The same procedure was used by the gunners of Guerrero according to Prebles crew but this was contradicted by the Lieutenant Chapline's, who said he could see the gun pointers just before Guerrero fired. At 7:51 am the range reduced a little so the Guerrero changed course to starboard and away from the Tampico. At 8:02 Guerrero stopped for a moment with her starboard broadside aimed at Tampico and fired; the range was around ; still neither Mexican gunboat inflicted a hit on the other. Many of Tampicos shells were falling about in front of Guerrero, the Americans deemed this as result of water- damaged ammunition or the dirty elevating gears on the 4-inch guns. When at 8:20 am, Guerrero came about again, presented her port broadside to Tampico before firing another. The Americans reported that the rate of firing increased at that time but all shells were falling short of target. At 8:22 am Guerrero began advancing towards Tampico slowly, at 8:24 am she made her first hit after well over a half an hour of fighting. The round hit the main deck between the poop and the main mast. A big cloud of white smoke confirmed the hit, but Tampico appeared to have suffered no serious damage. This shell was shrapnel, after the sea action, the Americans learned that Guerrero fired primarily shrapnel rounds during the combat. The rate of fire decreased a little at this point and no further hits were made by either side for some moments. At 8:34 one of the lifeboats, attached to Tampicos starboard, came loose and went adrift. A minute later, Guerrero advanced to a range of and then changed course to port, away from Tampico. This was the closest the two warships came to each other; it is believed that at this range, Tampico scored two hits on Guerrero. Both hits inflicted no major damage though. Guerrero came about once more at 8:40 am and a few minutes later, scored her second hit. This shell struck Tampicos gafif which pulled down the large Mexican flag. Again there was no major damage to the ship but morale was indeed hurt aboard Tampico. Two minutes later, at 8:50 am, Guerrero turned around, away from Tampico, then came back around and presented her portside battery at a range of . Guerrero fired and from this point on, several additional rounds struck Tampico. The Americans noted that at this time Guerrero was firing at the rate of two shots per minutes with her 4-guns and Tampico fired at the rate of one shot every two minutes with three of her guns. As Tampico only had 100 to 200 4-inch rounds at the start of hostilities, they concluded that Captain Malpica may have been preserving his armour piercing shells for when Guerrero came within close range. Two additional lifeboats went adrift at 9:01 am, a few minutes later Guerrero began to fire salvos. One of the salvos was sighted as hitting the water over Tampico, another over and a final, over target. None of the shots hit. Guerrero was still heading for Tampico at 9:14 am when she slowed down and fired some more before coming about to port again at 9:17 am. Lieutenant Chapline, after the action, discovered that Tampico was hit more often than what he and his crew were able to observe. One hit at the starboard bow, close to the unused 6-pounder gun, and exploded within the forecastle. Another struck near the portside 4-inch gun, which apparently damaged the weapon as it was not fired again after about 9:10. When 9:18 am came, a shrapnel shell exploded just in front of Tampico. This shell did not seem to harm Malpica's gunboat but the metal fragments killed some of the crew members, standing on deck. USS Preble A few minutes later smoke and fire was seen on Tampicos quarterdeck. No attempt was made to extinguish the flames, Tampicos boilers were broken so no pressure was available to push water out of the fire-mains. At 9:42, Captain Malpica ordered his crew to abandon ship. At 9:45 the flames on Tampicos quarterdeck grew larger and much smoke began to cover Tampico. Men aboard the rebel gunboat continued to fire the remaining 4-inch gun as the others left their ship. One of the gunners took up the large Mexican ensign and held it up with his hand until all of the other crew members were safely in life boats. Guerrero continued shooting until 9:50 am when the battle ended.Tampicos crew, in their boats, began to head for shore so Guerrero proceeded at full speed for the lifeboats in order to capture the rebels before they could reach shoal water and escape. Preble took the time to proceed to Tampico to give aid to the crewmen that remained aboard the ship. Preble came within of Tampico, there her crew witnessed several Mexicans running around on deck waving white rags as a sign of surrender. The men climbed all the way down the anchor cable but refused to jump into the water in order to swim to the American destroyer. During all of this, the fire was spreading aboard Tampico and began to start setting off the crates of small arms ammunition. A moment after that the fire reached the powder magazine; a large explosion ensued and 4-inch shells were launched in \\"every direction\\" according to Lieutenant Chapline. Some of the shots passed through Prebles rigging. USS New Orleans lowered two boats and sent them to pick up the rest of Tampicos crew, six men. The last man rescued was Tampicos paymaster, Rebatet, who was found by Guerrero, severely wounded and holding onto a wooden plank of wreckage. Aftermath After about thirty minutes of pursuit, Guerrero caught up with the two boats filled with Tampicos crew. There were no more chances to escape so Captain Malpica ordered his boats to Guerreros side for a surrender. While the rebel sailors were climbing up Guerreros ladder, Captain Hilario Malpica, stood up within his launch, removed his revolver from his side, placed it calmly to his head and fired. Immediately Captain Torres of Guerrero ordered his flag at half mast to honor the now dead Captain Malpica, the American vessels did the same. When the fighting was well over, Lieutenant Chapline learned from Captain Torres that Malpica was a well- respected man, despite his mutiny months earlier. Malpica had served with many of Guerreros crew members, prior to his mutiny. Captain Torres sent a radio message to Commander Irwin of New Orleans, thanking the United States Navy warships for half-masting their colors for the sake of Malpica. After taking an unknown number of prisoners, Guerrero returned to a position south of the burning Tampico. Guerrero anchored and boats were sent to Tampico with the intention of investigating her condition. USS New Orleans A tow-line was passed from the stern of Guerrero to Tampicos bow but Tampico was in no condition to be salvaged so the tow-line was later cut and Tampico finished sinking to the bottom. By 12:00 am, Tampico was fully submerged under of water. A U.S. Navy medic helped tend to an unknown number of wounded crewmen aboard Guerrero; two shot-holes were also observed by the Americans when they went aboard Guerrero. Captain Torres also informed Lieutenant Chapline that he ordered his crew to fire high, in hopes of killing Tampicos crew without damaging the gunboat. Tampico was hit a total of twelve times during the fight, five shells struck above the waterline and seven underneath. Five men were killed during the battle, excluding Captain Malpica, and another died the following day. Around thirty rebel sailors were wounded, twelve of them seriously. Captain Torres did not request that New Orleans surrender the six men she picked up; they were later transported to the United States and escaped becoming prisoners of war.

Formerly employed by Hit Radio X105,http://www.x105.co.nz/Shows.html he was a regular on the station's night weekend shifts, before the station's closure on Tuesday 14 September 2010. Slow gained notoriety because of a stunt that he undertook for the X105 radio station in which he managed to gatecrash a royal barbecue which was being held for Prince William, at Premier House in Wellington.https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/01/18/prince- william-security-alert-after-radio-dj-prank-115875-21976810/ His goal was to provide the visiting prince with 'Sizzlers', an iconic New Zealand sausage, and buttered bread, however Slow mistimed his entrance and was removed by police before Prince William arrived.  Early life  Warwick, born an MCFL, grew up in Wellington, notably living in Titahi Bay and Tawa during most of his childhood, which may have had an influence on his later life. He attended Onslow College, and went on to attend the New Zealand Radio Training School, from which he graduated. He then began an internship with a new Wellington- based radio station named Hit Radio X105 in late 2009.  Royal barbecue and controversy  On the 18th of January 2010, Slow attempted to provide Prince William with sausages and bread at an official royal barbecue, which took place at Premier House in Wellington. After attempting, and failing, to enter the Prime Minister's residence through the main entrance, Slow climbed over a fence and proceeded through the foliage to the main party area, posing as catering staff and asking several guests where he should put the sausages and bread that he was carrying. The entire event was broadcast live on X105 via Slow's cellphone. After entering the ministerial residence, he was spotted and apprehended by New Zealand police and was escorted off the premises for questioning. The packet of 'Sizzler' sausages used in the incident were later auctioned off on New Zealand auction website TradeMe.http://www.trademe.co.nz/Browse/Listing.aspx?id=266567873 Although Prince William had not yet arrived at the venue, and Slow posed no perceivable threat to the future monarch, the incident left the New Zealand Police embarrassed that such a major breach of security was possible, especially considering the high stature of persons present at the barbecue. New Zealand police chose not to lay charges on Slow for the incident, saying that they accept he did not intend to commit any criminal acts whilst on the property, though he has been issued with a trespass notice barring him from Premier House for two years. A review of security procedures was conducted which also concerned future royal visits. Wellington Police Area Commander Pete Cowan stated that: \\"Future royal visits to this country will see increased security, increased personal protection\\".

The headquarters for Operation Hestia were established in the city of Jacmel.CTV National News, airdate 27 January 2010  Force composition  The Canadian Forces deployed approximately 2,000 personnel, including the Air Component under the Command of Colonel Scott Clancy, and with a Naval Task Group from CFB Halifax, Nova Scotia, under the command of Maritime Command Captain Art McDonald, comprising: * the destroyer , carrying a CH-124 Sea King * the frigate ; * six CH-146 Griffon helicopters from 1 Wing Kingston squadrons; * a CC-177 Globemaster; * a CC-130 Hercules for airlift support; * the Disaster Assistance Response Team with three reverse osmosis water purification units; * an urban rescue and recovery team made up of search-and-rescue technicians and firefighters from across Canada; * a detachment of military police; and * a Land Force group drawn mostly from Canadian Forces Base Valcartier in Quebec, mainly due to French-speaking Haiti, comprising: ** the Task Force Headquarters, including the Task Force Commander's staff; ** a signals squadron, ** a light infantry battalion drawn from the 3rd Battalion, Royal 22e R√©giment, with two rifle companies, one service support company, one headquarters company, and a field engineer element; plus ** a Joint Task Force Support Element, drawn primarily from 5 Service Battalion, offering combat service support, Military Police and construction engineering support. The battalion of the Royal 22e R√©giment deployed to Haiti can only remain on station until late-March, as they will need to deploy to California, for training, prior to deployment to Afghanistan. Withdrawal is expected to be complete by April. Mission timeline Athabaskan was deployed to the city of L√©og√¢ne and Halifax was deployed to the city of Jacmel (Governor-General Micha√´lle Jean's hometownCTV National News, 18 January 2010), arriving at their respective locations off Haiti on 18 January 2010. Both naval vessels deployed their ship's companies as light engineering platoons, with the use of light equipment such as chainsaws, for relief operations in Haiti. They comprised approximately 500 sailors, and the ship's boarding parties were tasked with providing security to the sailors on shore.CBC News, The National, 18 January 2010 Athabaskan and Halifax had departed CFB Halifax for Haiti on 14 January 2010. Relief flights using CC-130 Hercules into Jacmel Airport started on 19 January, after having previously been scouted by CH-146 Griffons on 14 January. The identification of Jacmel Airport as a possible site for use and the decision to use Jacmel was made by Major-General Yvan Blondin. 8 Air Communications and Control Squadron installed runway lighting on 19 January at Jacmel Airport, enabling aircraft to land at night, with radar control of the airspace provided by the nearby . Opening the Jacmel airfield 24 hours-a-day was intended to help relieve congestion at Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport in Port-au- Prince. As of 20 January 2010, 1,504 people were evacuated from Haiti to Canada on 17 flights. 1,727 Canadians have been located while 479 were still unaccounted for. On 22 January, the DART facility in Jacmel moved from next to the Saint-Michel Hospital to the harbour. The DART field hospital was set up on the pier and was operating at capacity. The DART's Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit, which produces potable water from whatever source is available, including sea water, was set up on a jetty in Jacmel. Air traffic control was established at Jacmel Airport and, as of 22 January, the airport could accommodate a mix of 160 military and civilian fixed-wing and helicopter flights a day. The 1st Canadian Field Hospital was deployed to L√©og√¢ne. The Van Doos, have been deployed to L√©og√¢ne, to help with recovery efforts. As of 24 January in Jacmel, the organization of refugee camps continued, with the start of construction of proper latrines. Food distribution was being delivered by the UN, with Canadian soldiers providing security, and Haitian Girl Guides and Boy Scouts handling crowd control and organization. Canadian military firefighters were inspecting buildings in Jacmel to ascertain which were structurally sound and usable. A Canadian military clinic had been set up on the beach, with the Forces also establishing a tent city for those residents who had lost their homes. Canadian soldiers were providing security for food distribution points in L√©og√¢ne. On 28 January, Jacmel's first post- quake baby was born at the DART clinic. Late in January, plans were made with the U.S. to shift military flights from Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince to Jacmel Airport, to allow civilian flights into the capital's airport. It was expected that approximately 100 flights would be shifted to Jacmel. Canadian Forces were preparing for the increase in traffic, and were already dealing with degradation of the airstrip surface due to its current overuse. The Canadian Forces also started to monitor Jacmel-area orphanages to help protect against orphan-trafficking. After three weeks of operations, the Canadian Forces were \\"everywhere\\" in the Leogane-Jacmel Corridor. On 19 February, finished its operational tour, and left Jacmel. As of 22 February, military evacuation flights ended, Canadians that desired to leave were required to depart via commercial flights via Port-au-Prince International Airport, which had resumed operations. Over 4600 Canadians were evacuated on 48 flights. 50 Canadians were still listed as missing, while 34 were confirmed as killed. 1,681 members of the Canadian Forces remained in Haiti. On 22 February, Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon announced the start of a progressive drawdown of deployed Canadian Forces in Haiti. On 2 March, HMCS Halifax returned to CFB Halifax. On 5 March, it was announced that the 850 soldiers from CFB Valcartier of Joint Task Force Haiti (JTF Haiti, JTFH) would start gradually returning. As of 7 March 90 members of the Van Doos had returned home. It was announced that HMCS Athabaskan would end its mission on 10 March. On 9 March, the Jacmel dockside Canadian walk-in medical clinic closed, after treating more than 10,000 patients. As of 16 March, the Canadian military vacated Jacmel. Athabaskan returned to CFB Halifax on 17 March 2010. On 1 April 2010, the Joint Task Force Support Element closed the mission and the last remaining Canadian military forces left the theatre from the Port-au-Prince International Airport.  Reactions  After a fortnight of operations, a survey showed significant approval of the operation as a fitting Canadian response. The UN also expressed approval of the mission by Canada, but stated that the Canadian troops would not stay long. After three weeks of operations, the Haitians of Jacmel were happy with the help the Canadian Forces were providing. After five weeks, morale was high amongst Canadian Forces personnel deployed to Haiti. After two months, the Haitian government expressed its gratitude for Canada's help. Many groups charge that the Canadian Forces departed Jacmel abruptly, leaving it in no condition to continue on as a receiving and distribution hub. After the pullout, the airport could no longer process international flights, as no equipment remained to operate the control tower, nor heavy equipment to process the planes, or security to police supplies at the airport. The seaport was left without heavy equipment to handle cargo on ships, and without security to secure the port. An internal governmental report on the operation after its conclusion noted that the DART team was not given priority in aid flights, and were left without equipment supplies or security that it needed to function at full capacity. It further stated that various media groups and special interest groups were bumping supplies and personnel for the operation off the flights into Haiti from Canada. Other less critical supplies from aid groups were bumping critical supplies and equipment. It also noted that although DART should be at full readiness, all the time, it was given byes on preparedness.

Course  The river rises in Thuringia south of the Harz mountains in the district of Eichsfeld. Its source lies amongst the northern foothills of the Ohm Hills between Wei√üenborn-L√ºderode and St√∂ckey by the Helmspring. The Helme flows eastwards through the municipalities of Hohenstein and Werther to Nordhausen. Near Heringen the river is joined by the waters of the Zorge from the Harz. Northwest of the Kyffh√§user hills it is impounded into a reservoir and a flood retention basin by the Kelbra Dam in the Goldene Aue. From there the Helme ‚Äì now in the state of Saxony-Anhalt ‚Äì continues eastwards flowing through Ro√üla towards Allstedt, where it then swings south and enters Thuringia again. Near Kalbsrieth, southeast of Artern, it discharges into the Unstrut.  Helme watershed  The Helme watershed (German river index: 5648) together with the Kleine Helme (German river index: 5647.6) has a catchment of approximately 1,364 km2, whereby the watershed determination was recorded using the following topographical data: QGIS 3.4 with OSM Topo Map in the date WGS84, pseudo mercator (https://opentopomap.org). Wikipedia only mentions 1318.1 km2 for the Helme watershed. It is located in central Germany between the southern slopes of Harz and northern slopes of the Kyffh√§user hills on the lowlands of the Goldene Aue. The main flow is from west-north-west to east-south-east, the northernmost section is part of the Unstrut watershed (German river index 564), which in turn is part of the Saale (German River Index 56) and this in turn is part of the Elbe (German River index 5) watershed. The catchment of the Helme encompasses the entire southern Harz region in the north and the Goldene Aue in the middle; while the southern part is fed from a number of smaller hill ranges: in the southwest there are the northern slopes of the hill region south of the towns of Epschenrode - Trebra - Bliedungen - Fronderode, a little further east are the north and east slopes of the Butterberg southwest of Gro√üwerther. The central south of the watershed is formed by the north slope of the Windleite, the Numburg and Kyffh√§user hills. The south-south-east encompasses the north and east slopes of the Hutberg and Weinberg near Artern. The western limit of the Helme catchment area forms the main Elbe-Weser watershed: in the Harz between the St√∂berhai mountain and the village of Osterhagen, then through the village of Osterhagen, the Mackenr√∂de Forest and eastern crests of the Silkerode hill country west of Limlingerode, St√∂ckey and Epschenrode. The far east of the Helme catchment area is formed by the southwest slope of the Hornburg Saddle and heights northeast of the village of Bornstedt (near Eisleben) and Sittichenbach and the north and west slopes of the Ziegelroda Forest. The villages of Osterhagen (in the northwest) and Blankenheim (Mansfeld-S√ºdharz district) (in the northeast) lie directly on the watershed. The easternmost point is between Rothenschirmbach (inside) and Hornburg (already outside the catchment area), both south of Eisleben. The most important towns are the two county towns of Nordhausen and Sangerhausen, the former county town of Artern, the small towns of Bad Sachsa, Ellrich, Heringen/Helme, Kelbra (Kyffhaeuser), Stolberg (Harz) and Allstedt, greater villages like Steina, Walkenried, Ilfeld, Neustadt/Harz, Uthleben, Auleben, Rottleberode, Rossla, Tilleda, Wallhausen (Helme) and Kalbsrieth, and numerous smaller villages. Actually is divided and same time forms the outskirt of the German federal States of Niedersachsen (upper watershed), Th√ºringen (middle and extreme lower part), and Sachsen-Anhalt (lower part). Most of the local population speak the northern Thuringian dialect.  Current issues with the Helme watershed  (1) Political fragmentation of 3 states, any of them are managing their own natural resources, which means (2) Impossibility of an sound multidisciplinary integrated Watershed management and so an harmonious regional development; that means (3) powerful soil erosion and accelerate degradation of once fertile agricultural land, (4) silting and contamination of very important lakes and multiuse dams, shortening their live span, (5) Brain-drain, emigration of well educated creative young people, because of high unemployment levels, because is outskirt of places where decisions are made (in the 3 \\"far away\\" federal states), because of the creation of artificial superfluous borders between federal states that nobody wants.

It aims to improve the range and quality of mental health services by increasing the involvement of the voluntary sector in delivering them, working in partnership with the wider sector and government agencies. Specific projects include the promotion of innovation in the sector, evidencing best practice to achieve the best outcomes for individuals and supporting recovery. The Association leads a collaboration of voluntary mental health organisations including the Centre for Mental Health, National Survivor User Network for Mental Health (NSUN), the Mental Health Foundation, Mind and Rethink Mental Illness in the VCSE Health and Wellbeing Alliance with the Department of Health, NHS England and Public Health England. The Association's membership consists of voluntary sector organisations providing mental health services in England. The current Chief Executive (since April 2012) is Kathy Roberts, who has a background in health and social care and the voluntary and community sector. She succeeded Dr Ian McPherson, previously Director of the National Mental Health Development Unit. The first Chief Executive of the Forum was Judy Weleminsky who led the organisation from December 2005 to January 2011. The Association has increased its work to bring the views of mental health service providers into national policy and strategy discussions, working closely with members to inform and implement the 2011 No health without mental health cross-government mental health strategy. An area of focus from 2014 has been housing provision for people with mental health needs. In September 2014 AMHP published a report outlining successful housing models and a national forum is now established. Mental Health Recovery Star In 2008 the Association, with Triangle Consulting, worked with service users and the Association's members to develop the Mental Health Recovery Star, which was recommended by the Department of Health New Horizons programme and has been developed for use in adult mental health services. The Recovery Star is a key-working tool that enables staff to support individuals they work with to understand their recovery and plot their progress. It is also an outcomes tool that enables organisations to measure and assess the effectiveness of the services they deliver. It is now being used by many mental health trusts in England and has also been adopted for use by the Mental Health Recovery Service in Queensland, Australia.

He is known for his role in a successful lawsuit brought against the federal government of the United States which alleged that portions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act violated the United States Constitution. He is a former lobbyist for Gun Owners of America (GOA) and a two-time candidate for United States Congress. Mack is also the founder of Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA), and established the \\"County Sheriff Project\\" movement, both of whom reaffirm what they claim is the constitutional power to refuse to enforce federal laws. Mack v. United States Mack served as Graham County Sheriff from 1988 to 1996. In 1994 he was recruited by the National Rifle Association as a plaintiff in one of nine lawsuits against the Clinton administration over the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Mack v. United States (later restyled to Printz v. United States), a lawsuit against the federal government which alleged that portions of the Act violated the United States Constitution, because they comprised a congressional action that compelled state officers to execute Federal law. These portions were interim provisions until a national instant background check system for gun purchasers could be implemented. In a 5‚Äì4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the provisions of the Brady Act in question were, in fact, unconstitutional. Political views Mack is involved in the patriot movement through his role in the Oath Keepers organization and as founder of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA). Mack opposes all gun control laws, telling the program News21, \\"I studied what the Founding Fathers meant about the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms, and the conclusion is inescapable. There's no way around it. Gun control in America is against the law.\\" Oath Keepers and Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association In 2011 Mack founded the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA). The organization has a mission similar to Oath Keepers, encouraging members to refuse to enforce laws that they believe are unconstitutional. Mack is also on the board of Oath Keepers, a far-right patriot organisation known for its controversial presence during the Ferguson unrest and for supporting Cliven Bundy in his standoff against the federal government. In April, 2014, Mack asserted that as part of the citizen response to the Bundy standoff that the Oath Keepers were \\"...actually strategizing to put all the women up at the front. If they're gonna start shooting, it's going to be women that are gonna be televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center included both CSPOA and Oath Keepers on its list of 1,096 anti-government \\"patriot\\" groups active in 2013. =Bundy standoff= Mack was a lead figure in the 2014 Bundy standoff. Part of Mack's involvement was strategizing the standoff. Campaigns for Congress Mack ran as a Libertarian candidate for United States Senate in Arizona in 2006 against incumbent Jon Kyl, a Republican, but finished in the general election with 3% of the votes. In 2012, Mack opposed 13-term Representative Lamar Smith, who introduced and sponsored the controversial Stop Online Piracy Act legislation, in the House election Republican primary for Texas's 21st Congressional district. The primary was held on May 29. Mack lost, receiving 14.78% (10,111) of the votes. Campaign for Navajo County (Arizona) Sheriff 2016 On December 13, 2014, Mack announced his candidacy for Navajo County Sheriff. In his announcement, he said, \\"We‚Äôre gonna make it a constitutional county and show everybody the blueprint for freedom. And there‚Äôs a lot more people running for other offices than me. I just said I‚Äôd run for sheriff. We‚Äôre going to give this one more try. The election is in 2016. I‚Äôm going to be moving there in spring of 2015 so I can start getting ready for this. You have about a year and a half to decide. And I‚Äôm dead serious about this. If I can move there, so can you.\\"\\"Richard Mack Announces Plan for 'Constitutional' Takeover of Arizona's Navajo County.\\" YouTube. YouTube, 16 Dec. 2014. Web. 14 Aug. 2015. YouTube He lost that election to Democratic incumbent Kelly Clarke by around a 10-point margin. Law enforcement career Mack spent eleven years with the police department of Provo, Utah, and then moved back to Arizona to run for Graham County Sheriff in 1988. While serving as sheriff, he attended the FBI National Academy and graduated in 1992. Personal life Mack was born in 1952 in Arizona. He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and attended Brigham Young University, earning a degree in Latin American studies. In January 2015 he suffered a heart attack and his wife became ill in late 2014. Because he and his wife are self-employed they do not have insurance to pay for their medical bills. As a result, friends of the Macks have started a GoFundMe site on their behalf, asking to donate money to help pay for their medical expenses.

International Journal of Human‚ÄìComputer Studies 67(11) (Nov. 2009): 905‚Äì906. Sonic interaction design is at the intersection of interaction design and sound and music computing. If interaction design is about designing objects people interact with, and such interactions are facilitated by computational means, in sonic interaction design, sound is mediating interaction either as a display of processes or as an input medium.  Research areas = Perceptual, cognitive, and emotional study of sonic interactions  Research in this area focuses on experimental scientific findings about human sound reception in interactive contexts.Guillaume Lemaitre, Olivier Houix, Yon Visell, Karmen Franinoviƒá, Nicolas Misdariis, and Patrick Susini, (2009). \\"Toward the design and evaluation of continuous sound in tangible interfaces: The Spinotron\\". International Journal of Human‚ÄìComputer Studies 67(11) (Nov. 2009): 976‚Äì993. During closed-loop interactions, the users manipulate an interface that produces sound, and the sonic feedback affects in turn the users‚Äô manipulation. In other words, there is a tight coupling between auditory perception and action.Salvatore M. Aglioti and Mariella Pazzaglia (2010). \\"Representing actions through their sound\\". \\"Experimental Brain Research\\" 206(2): 141‚Äì151. Listening to sounds might not only activate a representation of how the sound was made: it might also prepare the listener to react to the sound. Cognitive representations of sounds might be associated with action-planning schemas, and sounds can also unconsciously cue a further reaction on the part of the listener.Marzia De Lucia, Christian Camen, Stephanie Clarke, and Micah M. Murray (2009). \\"The role of actions in auditory ob ject discrimination\\". \\"Neuroimage\\" 48(2): 475‚Äì485. Sonic interactions have the potential to influence the users‚Äô emotions: the quality of the sounds affects the pleasantness of the interaction, and the difficulty of the manipulation influences whether the user feels in control or not.Guillaume Lemaitre, Olivier Houix, Karmen Franinoviƒá, Yon Visell, and Patrick Susini (2009). \\"The Flops glass: a device to study the emotional reactions arising from sonic interactions\\".

Interactive art and music  In the context of sonic interaction design, interactive art and music projects are designing and researching aesthetic experiences where sonic interaction is in the focus. The creative and expressive aspects ‚Äì the aesthetics ‚Äì are more important than conveying information through sound. Practices include installations, performances, public art and interactions between humans through digitally-augmented objects/environments. These often integrate elements such as embedded technology, gesture-sensitive devices, speakers or context-aware systems. The experience is in the focus, addressing how humans are affected by the sound, and vice versa. Interactive art and music allows researchers to question existing paradigms and models of how humans interact with technology and sound, going beyond paradigms of control (human controlling a machine). Users are part of a loop which includes action and perception. Interactive art and music projects invite explorative actions and playful engagement. There is also a multi-sensory aspect, especially haptic-audioThe fifth International Workshop on Haptic and Audio Interaction Design (HAID) on September 16‚Äì17, 2010 in Copenhagen, Denmark. http://media.aau.dk/haid10/?page_id=46 and audio- visual projects are popular. Amongst many other influences, this field is informed by the development of the roles of instrument-maker, composer and performer merging.International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression http://www.nime.org/ Artistic research in sonic interaction design is about productions in the interactive arts and performing arts, exploiting the role of enactive engagement with sound‚Äìaugmented interactive objects.John Thompson, JoAnn Kuchera-Morin, Marcos Novak, Dan Overholt, Lance Putnam, Graham Wakefield, and Wesley Smith, (2009). \\"The Allobrain: An interactive, stereographic, 3D audio, immersive virtual world\\". International Journal of Human-Computer Studies 67(11) (Nov. 2009): 934‚Äì946.  Sonification  Sonification is the data-dependent generation of sound, if the transformation is systematic, objective and reproducible, so that it can be used as scientific method.Sonification ‚Äì A Definition http://sonification.de/son/definition For sonic interaction design, sonification provides a set of methods to create interaction sounds that encode relevant data, so that the user can perceive or interpret the conveyed information. Sonification does not necessarily need to represent huge amounts of data in sound, but may only convey one or few data values in a sound. To give an example, imagine a light switch that, on activation would create a short sound that depends on the electric power consumed through the cable: more energy-wasting lamps would perhaps systematically result in more annoying switch sounds. This example shows that sonification aims to provide some information by using its systematic transformation into sound. The integration of data-driven elements in interaction sound may serve different purposes: * to allow the users to refine their actions via auditory feedback. Example: the sonification-enhanced drilling machineTobias Grosshauser and Thomas Hermann, (2010). \\"Multimodal closed-loop Human Machine Interaction\\" Proc. Interactive Sonification Workshop, Stockholm, http://interactive- sonification.org/ISon2010/proceedings which indicates by sound when a wanted orientation to the wall is reached. * to influence how humans perceive their own body movement. * to create a sonic gestalt for the interaction which allows users to compare the detailed performance on repeated interactions: for instance rowing strokes may be sonified so that the sportsmen can better synchronize their action. * to enable novel functions that would otherwise be not available (e.g. a bottle that displays by sound how much fluid is poured into glasses so that the users can more easily fill the equal amount of liquid in different glasses). Within the field of sonification, sonic interaction design acknowledges the importance of human interaction for understanding and using auditory feedback.Thomas Hermann, and Andy Hunt, (2005). \\"Guest Editors' Introduction: An Introduction to Interactive Sonification\\". IEEE MultiMedia 12(2): 20-24. Within sonic interaction design, sonification can help and offer solutions, methods, and techniques to inspire and guide the design of products or interactive systems.

Walker wanted to appropriate Sonora, and his claims had both the support of tycoons and government complacency in the United States. In November 1853 he set off with two hundred men to La Paz, where he captured the political head and proclaimed the independence of the Republic of Baja California, a state that never had recognition nor truly existed because Walker had neither full control of the peninsula nor the support of the population. He faced resistance from the Mexican army and from civilians, among them a group led by . In spite of being replicated in Ensenada and suffering the mutiny of his US troops, Walker declared himself president of the Republic of Sonora, which also included Baja California, and, like his successor, was not there in fact or endorsement. In fact, Walker reached Sonora only in 1854 and when pressured by the United States Navy had to flee to Ensenada, Mexico. In the face of Melendrez's harassment and the desertion of more troops, Walker and the remnants of his filibuster army surrendered to the US military in San Diego. Brought to trial, the judge said he was guilty of violating the Neutrality Act signed between Mexico and the United States after the US invasion of Mexico in 1847. However, Walker was acquitted by the jury.  History  William Walker was an American physician and adventurer who settled in California during the gold rush. He had tried to take over the state of Sonora before launching the campaign against Baja California, with the support of American moguls. The flag hoisted by William Walker consists of a star representing the Republic of Baja California. Walker left California with 45 American mercenaries on October 17, 1853, with the intention of arriving at Guaymas (Sonora), and occupying the Mexican state. However, one year before, the Mexicans had already repelled an expedition of French filibusters, increased their troops and had military preparedness. Perhaps this made Walker refrain. He chose to first attack and take the Baja California peninsula as a first step to seize Sonora. Aboard the schooner Caroline, Walker's expedition arrived at Cabo San Lucas on October 28 of that year. He moved by sea to La Paz, capital of Baja California territory, which he occupied five days after the capture of Rafael Espinosa, political head of the territory. There, the filibusters hauled down the Mexican flag and hoisted in place a flag of three horizontal stripes, two red and a white center, with two stars representing Baja California and Sonora.Rosengarten, 2002. 77 On November 3, 1853, the mercenaries proclaimed the independence of the peninsula which they called the Republic of Baja California. Later, the expedition captured Colonel Juan Cl√≠maco Rebolledo, who came to replace Espinosa in the office of a political leader without knowing that the capital of Baja California had been seized by the American invaders. The second flag hoisted by William Walker consists of two stars representing the \\"republic of Baja California and Sonora.\\" Since the expedition of reinforcements from California were slow in coming, Walker decided to move its headquarters to the north of the peninsula, near the border with U.S. and the land passage to Sonora, which was the goal of their ambitions and also the US government, which had already expressed its intention to buy northwestern Mexico. In La Paz, there were some clashes between civilian residents and filibusters, Walker played as military victories over the Mexican government, which he accused of being tyrant and decadent. And in Ensenada, the filibusters established their headquarters in what is now the Third and Gast√©lum streets of that city Olmeda Garc√≠a, 2010: 20-21 From there, Walker issued a proclamation to the American people, requesting their support to defend the independence of Baja California, which had a self-appointed president. Many American volunteers joined the call of Walker, to add a number of 253 climbers who arrived in Ensenada on the boat Anita.

The portrait depicts Isabel Lobo Velasco de Porcel, who was born at Ronda around 1780 and was the second wife of Antonio Porcel. Isabel's husband was 25 years older than she; they met when she was 20 years old. Antonio Porcel was a liberal and associate of Manuel Godoy, Prince of Peace, who was a friend of Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, who in turn brought him in contact with Goya, who lived nearby; the painting is said to have been a gift from the artist in return for hospitality. A Goya portrait of Antonio Porcel, though much larger and so not a matching piece, was lost in a fire when the Jockey Club in Buenos Aires was destroyed in a riot in 1953.MacLaren, 13 The half-length portrait depicts a young woman dressed in typical Spanish attire, a white shirt and a black mantilla. In spite of her \\"maja\\" attire, the richness of the textiles and her ladylike appearance give the picture an aristocratic elegance; at this time wealthy Spanish \\"people of fashion\\" often wore the styles of lower class urban dandies and their female equivalents, as seen in Goya's famous clothed version of La Maja.MacLaren, 12-13 The decisive gesture of her arms in the akimbo position and her confidence stand out. Her eyes and hair are light brown, her skin is pale, and her body is slightly turned to the left side, while her head gives balance by being turned to the opposite side. Goya achieves realism and deepness without adding secondary objects to the composition. One of the unique aspects of this painting is that the woman is looking towards the left side of the viewer and not towards him, which is the case of the majority of Goya's paintings. Some scholars have recently cast doubts over its attribution. Notes References  *Bozal, Valeriano. Francisco Goya, vida y obra, (2 vols.) Madrid, Tf., 2005. . *Glendinning, Nigel.

The creek flows in a northeasterly direction for until it enters the Palo Alto Flood Basin, where it joins Adobe Creek in the Palo Alto Baylands at the north end of the Mayfield Slough, just before its culmination in southwest San Francisco Bay. Matadero Creek begins in the city of Los Altos Hills, then traverses the Stanford University lands and Palo Alto. History 1862 George F. Allardt map of the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad ‚Äì Matadero Creek (then Crosby's Creek) is featured in the upper right portion of the map and appears to end in or near the Baylands marshes. The historical presence of steelhead trout in the creek indicates that it was at least intermittently connected to San Francisco Bay during spawning runs in periods of high winter flows. The Wallace Stegner Pathway along Matadero Creek in Los Altos Hills, California Matadero Creek at Cornelis Bol Park in Barron Park, Palo Alto, California Matadero Creek was originally called Arroyo del Matadero on maps from the 1830s and 1840s, and matadero means slaughtering place in Spanish. On the 1862 Allardt Map of the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad, Matadero Creek is denoted as Crosby's Creek. In 1853, Elisha Crosby bought a 250-acre parcel of Rancho Santa Rita, really Rancho Rincon de San Francisquito, from the Robles family, and founded Mayfield Farm, but she lost it only 3 years later. On the March 5, 1863 map \\"Plat of the Rancho Rincon de San Francisquito\\", it is denoted as Matadero Creek. On the Palo Alto Topo Map of 1899, it was referred to as Madera Creek, a name which suggests its prior value as a source of timber (madera in Spanish). In 1875 French financier Jean Baptiste Paulin Caperon, better known as Peter Coutts, purchased land in Mayfield and four other parcels around three sides of today's College Terrace ‚Äì more than a thousand acres extending from today's Page Mill Road to Serra Street and from El Camino Real to the foothills. Coutts named his property Ayrshire Farm. His fanciful 50 foot tall brick tower near Matadero Creek likely marked the south corner of his property. Leland Stanford started buying land in the area in 1876 for a horse farm, called the Palo Alto Stock Farm. Stanford bought Ayrshire Farm in 1882. Famous author Wallace Stegner lived near Matadero Creek at 13456 South Fork Lane in nearby Los Altos Hills, while a Professor at Stanford University. Stegner became one of the town's most prominent residents. In 1962, he co-founded the Committee for Green Foothills, an environmental organization dedicated to preserving and protecting the hills, forests, creeks, wetlands and coastal lands of the San Francisco Peninsula.

Los Altos Hills named the Stegner Pathway for the author who lived for many years just uphill from that pathway running from Three Forks Lane to Edgerton Road. Watershed Deer Creek approaching the culvert at La Barranca Road, Los Altos Hills Concretization of Matadero Creek's banks (in back of shot) accelerates stream flows, causing severe channel incision which is now threatening Page Mill Road below the Arastradero Road intersection Jan. 2011 Matadero Creek at West Bayshore Road, near Highway 101 in Palo Alto, looking south. The concrete channel is very wide by then to carry large flows. Matadero Creek's mainstem begins at elevation 640 feet just north of Altamont Road and west of Black Mountain Road in Los Altos Hills. The creek has two significant tributaries, Arastradero Creek and Deer Creek. Arastradero Creek is protected by the Arastradero Preserve. Arastradero Creek begins at elevation 800 feet just south of the terminus of Alexis Drive in Palo Alto, and heads briefly west then north around the Palo Alto Hills Country Club where it is dammed to form small two small water bodies (Sobey Pond and Arastradero Lake), then joins Matadero Creek where Arastradero Road intersects Page Mill Road. Deer Creek begins at elevation 680 feet just north of Altamount Road and west of Taafe Road in Los Altos Hills, then flows northerly passing under Interstate 280 at the La Barranca Road underpass, where it turns west and parallels Purissima Road, crosses Arastradero Road and Deer Creek Road, before joining the Matadero Creek mainstem just south of Foothill Expressway and east of Page Mill Road. Deer Creek has also been labelled as Purisima Creek on some maps. ‚Äì The 1961‚Äì1969 USGS topo maps label Deer Creek as Purisima Creek, but the 1976 map corrects this; the next creek to the southeast is Purisima Creek, a tributary of Adobe Creek. The Santa Rita Creek tributary, which drains the faculty housing area of Stanford, was artificially connected to Matadero Creek by the \\"Stanford Channel\\". Historically Santa Rita Creek terminated in the marshlands in historic Mayfield. The Matadero Creek watershed drains , of which are mountainous land, and are gently sloping valley floor. Downstream of Foothill Expressway Matadero Creek has been greatly modified for flood protection. From Highway 101 to El Camino Real the creek flows through a concrete trapezoidal channel. In 1990, the concrete trapezoidal channel was extended from the CalTrain tracks to El Camino Real. On the historic 1862 Allardt Map Barron Creek was a tributary of Adobe Creek, but on the 1899 Topo Map Barron Creek was tributary to Matadero Creek, although subsequently Barron Creek was connected to Adobe Creek north of U. S. Highway 101. However, during large storm events flow may be diverted to Matadero Creek from Barron Creek via the Barron Diversion Channel. On June 27, 2012 the creek suddenly dropped a foot and went dry below Matadero Avenue whereas it usually flows all summer from Bol Park to El Camino Real at the Creekside Inn. This may be related to the removal of toxic groundwater in the watershed, although it is normally cleaned and then returned to the creek. The creek remains perennial in Bol Park. Ecology Matadero Creek at Hillview Road, Palo Alto, with Great Blue Heron Three gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), the only tree-climbing canid in the Americas, den and forage for rodents, grasshoppers, and berries near the mouth of Matadero Creek in the Baylands View of Interstate 280 from the Matadero Creek Trail, which crosses the hill between Matadero Creek and its Deer Creek tributary Recently, gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) have been documented near the mouth of Matadero Creek (see photo). Populations of gray fox have increased in the South Bay since the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has culled non-native red fox (Vulpes vulpes) because the latter prey on endangered California clapper rail (Rallus longirostris obsoletus). Genetically, gray fox are the most basal of all canids. Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were supported by Matadero Creek historically, and at least as recently as the late 1980s. In 1905 John Otterbein Snyder collected O. mykiss (then called Salmo irideus) in \\"Madera Creek\\", today's Matadero Creek. A California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) field note from 1945 documents a fisherman's sighting of steelhead adults in Matadero Creek two years prior (1942/43 season). According to CDFG, steelhead were caught by local fishermen during 1985, 1986 and 1987 in Mayfield Slough at the confluence of Matadero and Adobe Creeks. At least six steelhead were noted passing the tidal gates at Mayfield Slough in the Palo Alto Flood Basin in April 1987. Also, 1986 CDFG correspondence identifies Matadero Creek as an anadromous steelhead trout stream with winter spawning runs. However, in February 1997, Leidy electrofished Matadero Creek at three sites between Laguna Street and the third downstream bridge crossing on Old Matadero Creek Road and no O. mykiss were found. Regarding whether steelhead trout could have accessed Matadero Creek historically, since it appears to have terminated in an alluvial fan prior to reaching Bay marshlands, Snyder wrote in 1905 about a historical connection that formed when some willows deflected San Francisquito Creek to Matadero Creek, allowing Sacramento suckers (Catostomus occidentalis) to ascend the latter creek, where they had not been seen before despite eight years of monitoring. It is also possible that very high flows would have connected the historical Matadero Creek to the Bay's tidal marshes in flood years. At the present, of course, Matadero Creek has been lengthened to connect to Adobe Creek in Mayfield Slough in the Palo Alto Flood Basin. In June, 1980 local residents spotted a milky substance in the creek that was determined to be wheelchair cleaning solvent dumped into the waters by the Veterans Administration Medical Center. The large population of resident Pacific tree frogs (Pseudacris regilla regilla) near the creek was nearly extirpated. In the 1970s the \\"nightly tree frog chorus along Matadero Creek was almost deafening in the mating season and loud during all the warmer months\\", according to Barron Park historian, Douglas Graham. Despite several efforts to re-introduce tree frogs from neighboring Barron Creek and Lake Lagunita, at the present time they have only recovered to 5%-10% of their original numbers. Acterra currently monitors insects in the creek, which serve as indicator species for the cleanliness and health of the stream. The Palo Alto Flood Basin Jim McCarthy, Adobe and Matadero Creek Streamkeeper, was honored by the Santa Clara County Creeks Coalition for his work to restore the creek. Here he measures temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, copper levels, and turbidity 2010. The Palo Alto Flood Basin was constructed in 1956 in order to prevent a repeat of the floods of 1955, when a high tide prevented the escape of heavy runoff from Matadero, Adobe, and Barron Creeks into the San Francisco Bay. The trapped runoff waters overflowed upstream creek banks and caused severe flooding in Palo Alto. In order to control the flow of water into the flood basin, a tidegate was placed at the confluence of Adobe Creek, Matadero Creek, and the San Francisco Bay, so that the flood basin could be maintained at approximately 2 feet below sea level, creating room to absorb floodwaters. The tidegate consists of several weirs and one operator- controlled sluice gate that enables tidal flows into the basin in order to improve water quality and for mosquito control. Three agencies oversee the tidegates: Santa Clara Valley Water District, City of Palo Alto, and Santa Clara County Vector Control. Because the trash grate and weirs separate the mouth of the flood basin from the San Francisco Bay estuary, large fish cannot swim freely between the Bay and the basin, unless the sluice gate is open. In addition, the tidegates are set to reduce tidal inflows into the basin, so that the basin is mostly freshwater. After a rainstorm the tidegate is kept closed, however this is precisely when steelhead trout in-migrations should occur. From November 16 to 20, 2002, approximately 100 striped bass (Morone saxatilis), 5 bat rays (Myliobatis californica) and 2 leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata) were found dead in the Flood Control Basin in both Adobe and Matadero Creeks within one mile of the tidegate. The fishkill was attributed to the first large rainstorm washing a large amount of leaf litter into the basin, leading to eutrophication and low dissolved oxygen. This is supported by the fact that the dead fish were all large (requiring more oxygen) at 2 to 4 feet long and the mouths and gills of the bass were fully extended open.

The total area is 39.75 km¬≤ which gives a population density, using 2006 values, of 829 inhabitants per km¬≤. As a result of extensive local government boundary changes in 1977 Korbeek-Lo, as an administrative entity, was abolished. Since then the more built up western part of Korbeek-Lo has been subsumed into Leuven while the more rural eastern part of the former municipality is now part of Bierbeek. History Hoeve Trappeniers, one of several traditional farmsteads in Korbeek-Lo. The rural character of the village is currently under threat. The history of Korbeek-Lo starts a long way back. On the St.-Martinusberg plateau traces have been found of prehistoric homesteads. There is also evidence of Roman settlement, and there is evidence of human habitation during the subsequent Frankish period. One of the surviving farmsteads bears the name \\"Het Dalemhof\\", of which the middle syllable is thought to derive from the Germanic word \\"heim\\", endorsing the view that the name is of Frankish provenance. There is little consensus on the origins of the name. One theory is that 'Korbeek' is an old term for a gentle murmuring brook, while ‚ÄòLo‚Äô is an old word for a copse. 'Korbeek' might simply mean ‚Äòshort brook‚Äô. 1107 finds a surviving record of the name, written as 'Corbeke‚Äô, while alternative early orthographies also include 'Cortbeke' en 'Cortebeke'. There was already a church here, in 1102, which was required to make annual payments to the abbey at Sint-Truiden. By the late medieval period Korbeek-Lo was an agricultural village, with a handful of substantial farmsteads owned by monasteries, charitable institutions or wealthy citizens from nearby Leuven/Louvain. By the end of the fifteenth century several breweries were present, and these were popular with visitors because they were subject to lower taxation rates than breweries in Leuven. The end of the medieval period was a time of suffering, notably at the hands of Emperor Maximillian (1488-1489) and during the Siege of Louvain by Maarten van Rossum in 1542, and again during the religious wars of the late sixteenth century, the campaigning following the creation of the Franco-Dutch alliance of 1635 and again the French invasion of 1695. Korbeek- Lo also suffered from the European wars of the twentieth century. In 1914, 24 and 25 August saw central Louvain/Leuven set alight, and during the ensuring days it was the turn of the villages along the road towards Tienen to suffer similar assaults. Almost every house in Korbeek-Lo was plundered and 132 homes, along with 3 schools and 4 chateaux, were destroyed. 18 died. Thirty years later, during the night of 2 September 1944, four railway trucks at the station loaded with explosives blew up, the force of the explosion damaging virtually every building in the village. By the end of the nineteenth century the van 'De Mol' quarter also contained several small brick works, but these had all ceased to operate. Today Korbeek-Lo is a residential and commercial centre on the eastern side of Leuven. Transport and traffic The village is bisected by the straight road connecting Leuven and Brussels to the west with Tienen, Sint-Truiden and Liege to the east. As a main road with a hard surface (known as a \\"Steenweg\\"/\\"stone road\\"), this section dates back to 1716, though its designation as the N3 (National road 3) is a twentieth century development. Korbeek-Lo is also on the main railway line running from Brussels to Liege, this section of line, from Louvain to Tienen, having been opened in 1837. Trains no longer serve the community from here, however, since the station has been closed. The nineteenth century line has since 1993 been complemented by a High Speed Train line linking Brussels with Liege and Cologne, but at Korbeek-Lo 900 meters of the high speed track is concealed in a tunnel in order to cross other pre-existing communication routes. A modern motorway, the A3/E40, of which the local section opened in 1972, parallels to the older National Road 3, but is positioned a couple of kilometers to the south and therefore a short distance away from the centre of the village. The nearest access point is Junction 23 (Haasrode exit), roughly 5 km / 3 miles to the south-west.

He was a younger son of chief Iain Ciar and was originally intended to enter the church, as his nickname shows; however, on the death of his elder brother, William Cleireach became the heir to the chiefship. As chief of the clan, he led his followers in attacks against the Frasers and defended his lands against the MacDonalds. He did not live a long life and was said to have been buried on the isle of Iona with his predecessors. Life The Bannatyne manuscript states that William Cleireach was the second son of Iain Ciar, fourth chief of Clan MacLeod. William Cleireach was originally bred for the church, having been educated in a monastery abroad. For this reason, he was known as \\"the clerk\\". His elder brother was killed at a feast and upon his death, William Cleireach returned home. As Iain Ciar's only surviving son and that William Cleireach succeeded his father upon his death, in 1392. The Bannatyne manuscript records that at the time of William Cleireach's succession, the MacLeods and Frasers were quarrelling as they had been for years previous; in consequence, William invaded the Fraser controlled lands of Aird. The MacLeods were successful in this particular venture and carried off much loot from their invasion. According to the early 20th-century clan historian R.C. MacLeod, the first record of conflict between the MacLeods and MacDonalds took place during the tenure of William Cleireach. MacLeod stated that Alexander III had originally placed the isles of Skye and Lewis into the earldom of Ross; making the Earl of Ross superiors to the MacLeods. However, in 1335, these lands had been granted by charter to John MacDonald, who would later become the Lord of the Isles. Later, in 1344, the grant of Lewis was confirmed, but Skye reverted to the Earl of Ross. When William Cleireach succeeded to the chiefship in 1392, he then held his lands under three feudal superiors--in Glenelg, as a vassal of the king of Scots; in Skye, as a vassal of the Lord of the Isles; in Skye as a vassal to the Earl of Ross. MacLeod also stated that matters were further complicated by the fact that Donald, who succeeded to the Lordshop of the Isles in 1380, claimed that Skye had been given to him in terms of his marriage to a daughter of the Earl of Ross; and in consequence he claimed that William Cleireach was his own vassal on both Harris and Skye. Ruinous Castle Camus. The MacDonalds, under Alasdair, brother of the Lord of the Isles (and ancestor of the MacDonalds of Keppoch), landed at Eynort. The MacLeods, under William Cleireach, met the invading MacDonald force at the head of Loch Sligachan. The manuscript states that during the bloody encounter, the MacDonalds were defeated and their leader was slain by Tormod Coil, cousin of William Cleireach (and the son of Murdo, William Cleireach's uncle). Following the battle, William Cleireach divided the loot amongst his followers. The Bannatyne manuscript relates how William Cleireach did not live very long and died relatively young at Castle Camus, in Sleat. It states that he was buried on the sacred island of Iona, probably in about the year 1402. Issue The Bannatyne manuscript describes William Cleireach as being much beloved by his followers. He was said to have had many illegitimate children whose descendants were still alive when the manuscript was written (c.1830s). The manuscript described two of his twin sons as the \\"Castor and Pollux of the islanders\\". According to the manuscript, William Cleireach married a daughter of MacLean of Duart (chief of Clan MacLean). The late 19th-century historian A. Mackenzie stated that William's wife was a daughter of John Maclean of Lochbuie (of Clan MacLaine of Lochbuie). However, A.M. Sinclair, another late 19th-century historian, stated that William Cleireach married a daughter of Murdoch MacLaine of Lochbuie (second chief of his clan). The manuscript relates how William and his wife had three sons--John, his heir; Tormod; and George. The manuscript states that from Tormod descended the \\"Mac Vic Williams\\"; it notes that the only living descendants were the sons of Capt. William MacLeod of Borline then existed (in about the 1830s), though it also noted that some of the family lived in North Carolina. The manuscript mentions another family, called \\"Mac Vic Alastair Ruaidh\\", which was descended from Tormod's second son. The head of this family lived on St Kilda and a notable member of this family was the poet Mairi nighean Alasdair Ruaidh. The manuscript states that William's third son, George, went abroad and settled in Lorraine. An account of the George's descendants was sent to a MacLeod in Britain in the year 1758. The manuscript states that this account professed that descendants of George were known on the continent as \\"de Leod\\" and \\"Von Leod\\"; that some of them were landowners before the French Revolution.

He brought Western romanticism especially English lyric style to Telugu literature. However, he followed classical Sanskrit and Telugu meter in his writings and he didn't abandon Sanskrit Telugu form common language. His literature themes include sensual material, love of nature, patriotism, spirituality, humanitarianism and social reforms. Sensuality, in general, may be divided into two kinds, union and separation. Rayaprolu preferred separation in his writings. In his first independent poem, Trunakankanamu, Rayaprolu narrates love pangs of separation. The hero's lover marries another man and he remains unmarried to suffer from the memories. By the end of the poem, hero's love transforms into a platonic love and friendship. In this poem, Rayaprolu's heroin continues a platonic relationship with the hero while married to another man. In Kastakamala, Kamala loves (platonic) two men. However, when one of them writes a love letter, she commits suicide. Rayaprolu was a great patriot and Telugu nationalist. He praised the (past) greatness of Telugu warriors to awaken the sleeping Telugu pride. Rayaprolu Subbarao defined Telugu romanticism and began a new era in Telugu literature. His romantic literature is considered as the watershed in Telugu literature for its modernity of themes such as naturalism, rural life, platonic love, a sense of history, libertarianism, patriotism, and fierce nationalism.

It is around south-east of Stoke-on-Trent. The River Tean runs through the village, heading east towards Uttoxeter. Population details for the 2011 census can be found under Checkley. The village is itself composed of two villages: Upper Tean (the larger of the two) and Lower Tean. It is part of the Checkley ward within the Staffordshire Moorlands district. The surrounding area is predominantly farming / rural, and it is a short drive into the southern edge of the Peak District. The Heath House, a Gothic Revival mansion and estate, is located to the east of the village. The village also contains an historic tape mill (now converted into apartments / flats). There are a number of pubs & shops, a doctors' surgery, nurseries, a village hall (Greatwood Hall), three churches, and a small park. There is free car parking signposted off one end of the High Street (between the two pubs). Major employers in the area include Alton Towers, JCB, Toyota, and Fox's Biscuits. History Tape mill on High Street, Upper Tean The village was within the ancient Hundred of Totmonslow as Tene in the Domesday Book survey of 1086, when it had 15 households.Lower and Upper Tean Open Domesday, accessed 9 Aug 2014. In the 18th century, a tape weaving company was established in the village by John and Nathaniel Philips: in 1747 they bought Tean Hall, a half-timbered building in Upper Tean built in 1613, and it became a base for their company. Tapes were at first produced in tape-weavers' cottages, using looms provided by the company. From the early 19th century, factories, housing steam-powered Jacquard looms, were built in the village; the factories, adjacent to Tean Hall, were known as Tean Hall Mills.\\"Staffordshire places: Tean\\" Staffordshire Pasttrack.

Transport The village is well positioned for transport, with road / bus connections east to Uttoxeter & Derby, and west to Stoke. Tean lies at the crossroads of the A522 road between Cheadle, Staffordshire and Uttoxeter, and the road from Blythe Bridge to Rocester. It is a 10-minute drive east or west to join the main A50 at either Uttoxeter or Blythe Bridge. From the A50 there are direct links to both the M1 and M6. The village is approx. 50 minutes from both Manchester and East Midlands airports, and 1 hour 10 minutes from Birmingham airport. The village was served by Tean railway station at Totmonslow (to the west of the village) until its closure in 1953. The nearest railway stations now are Blythe Bridge & Uttoxeter - both branch line - or Derby & Stoke - for main lines. First Bus and D&G; Buses serve the village.

The brand began as a service creating Wikipedia articles for paying corporations. History Gregory Kohs and his sister started the MyWikiBiz venture in July 2006, as a paid editing service, writing content for inclusion in Wikipedia and other community-edited sites. Kohs charged between US$49 and US$99 for articles. At the time, though it was widely known that Wikipedia was used by corporations and public relations firms, such contributions were often hidden, only to be discovered later. Wikipedia co- founder Jimmy Wales expressed opposition to the idea of a paid editing service. A few days after MyWikiBiz was launched, the site's user account was blocked by Wales on the grounds of \\"paid editing on behalf of customers\\". It was one of the few such blocks personally by Wales in Wikipedia's history. Wales viewed the problem as one of \\"conflict of interest and the appearance of impropriety arising from editors being paid to write by the subjects of the articles\\". He and Kohs reached an agreement, under which Kohs could create \\"Wikipedia-like\\" articles on his site and that they could then be \\"scraped\\" to Wikipedia by Wikipedia editors. The agreement soon unraveled, and Kohs was blocked from editing Wikipedia. In his book The Future of the Internet ‚Äì And How to Stop It, Jonathan Zittrain said that Wales believed that MyWikiBiz had been \\"spamming Wikipedia with corporate advertisements rather than 'neutral point of view' articles\\", but also that MyWikiBiz persuaded some Wikipedians to lower objections to an article merely because of its source. The Chronicle of Higher Education said \\"it's hard to feel too bad for MyWikiBiz,\\" and that \\"if the encyclopedia is serious about gaining acceptance from academia, surely it has a vested interest in dissuading companies from paying to improve their presence on the site.\\" In late October 2006, Kohs formed a partnership to promote and market a wiki-based directory at Centiare.com, after which Kohs moved its contents to MyWikiBiz.com.

It is the home stadium of Ballinamallard United. It was first used by Ballinamallard United in 1975, when the club was founded.  History  Since 2006, Ferney Park has undergone a number of renovations. The ground did not meet the criteria for use in the IFA Championship, which was established in 2008, and Ballinamallard played its home matches at Holm Park, the home of Armagh City, during the 2008/09 season and the first part of 2009/10, while it was brought up to standard. Ballinamallard's first match back at the upgraded Ferney Park was on 5 December 2009.Impartial Reporter, 3 December 2009, Time to stand and deliverBallinamallard United 0-5 Portadown Floodlights were installed in 2010.Let There Be Light! In 2012, Ballinamallard United were promoted to the IFA Premiership after receiving a domestic licence to do so from the Irish Football Association. However at the time, Ferney Park did not meet the required standards. The club were in the process of building two new stands, funded by fans buying seats. The plans and designs of the new stands were printed on the cover of the matchday programme for United's last game before being promoted against Ards. The building of the stands could not be guaranteed to be completed before the start of the Irish Premiership season. As a result, the club were obliged to nominate Stangmore Park in Dungannon, County Tyrone as their home ground if construction could not be finished in time. At a cost of ¬£80,000 from four fans, the pitch at Ferney Park was also re-laid in preparation. However, the work was finished in time for Ferney Park to be used to host Ballinamallard's opening game against Dungannon Swifts. The new stands were also officially opened for this match. In December 2012, during half-time in a match between Ballinamallard United and Linfield, the Ferney Park pitch was invaded by twenty Linfield supporters who waved Union Flags from the centre of the pitch. This was done as part of the Belfast City Hall flag protests. Ballinamallard United had no prior warning that this would happen and the Police Service of Northern Ireland took no actions amid fears of inflaming the situation.  Usage  Ferney Park is home to Ballinamallard United and is also used to host their reserves' matches. It is also home to the Fermanagh Mallards women's football club. In 2012, Ferney Park was used to host the opening game of the Northern Ireland Milk Cup between Fermanagh and English side, Newcastle United. This was done to commemorate the Milk Cup's 30th anniversary by playing competition matches away from the normal locations along the north coast of Northern Ireland. Ferney Park has received a reputation in Northern Irish football as being a difficult ground to find with members of the media covering games at the stadium often getting lost on their way to it. This sometimes led to television channels having to use Ballinamallard United's own coverage of matches to be broadcast on television. This was often attributed to television companies deeming it too expensive to regularly send cameras to Ballinamallard. This situation has been criticized by Ballinamallard residents who feel that television coverage of Ballinamallard United is not as detailed as other teams because of the location of Ferney Park.

He led the Socialist Party of Serbia from its foundation in 1990 and rose to power as Serbian President during efforts to reform the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia in response to alleged marginalization of Serbia, views that Serbia's autonomous provinces had too much power, making them almost independent from Serbia, and claims of political incapacity to deter Albanian separatist unrest in Serbia's autonomous province of Kosovo. Milo≈°eviƒá's presidency of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was marked by several major reforms to Serbia's constitution from the 1980s to the 1990s that reduced Serbia's autonomous provinces' powers. In 1990, Serbia transitioned from a Titoist one-party system to a multi-party system and attempted reforms to the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution. The constituent republics of the country split apart amid the outbreak of wars, and the former Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro founded the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Milo≈°eviƒá negotiated the Dayton Agreement on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs, which ended the Bosnian War in 1995. During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Milo≈°eviƒá was charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) with war crimes in connection to the Bosnian War, the Croatian War of Independence, and the Kosovo War. He became the first sitting head of state to be charged with war crimes. During the 1990s, numerous anti-government and antiwar protests took place. It is estimated that between 50,000 and 200,000 people deserted the Milo≈°eviƒá-controlled Yugoslav People's Army, while between 100,000 and 150,000 people emigrated from Serbia, refusing to participate in the wars. Milo≈°eviƒá resigned from the Yugoslav presidency amid demonstrations after the disputed presidential election of 24 September 2000, and was arrested by Yugoslav federal authorities on 31 March 2001 on suspicion of corruption, abuse of power, and embezzlement. The initial investigation into Milo≈°eviƒá faltered for lack of evidence, prompting Serbian Prime Minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá to extradite him to the ICTY to stand trial for war crimes instead. At the outset of the trial, Milo≈°eviƒá denounced the Tribunal as illegal because it had not been established with the consent of the United Nations General Assembly; therefore he refused to appoint counsel for his defence. Milo≈°eviƒá conducted his own defence in the five-year trial, which ended without a verdict when he died in his prison cell in The Hague on 11 March 2006. Milo≈°eviƒá suffered from heart ailments and hypertension, and died of a heart attack. The Tribunal denied any responsibility for Milo≈°eviƒá's death and said that he had refused to take prescribed medicines and medicated himself instead. After Milo≈°eviƒá's death, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) concluded separately in the Bosnian Genocide Case that there was no evidence linking him to genocide committed by Bosnian Serb forces during the Bosnian War. But the Court did find that Milo≈°eviƒá and others in Serbia had violated the Genocide Convention by failing to prevent the genocide from occurring, by not cooperating with the ICTY in punishing its perpetrators, in particular General Ratko Mladiƒá, and by violating its obligation to comply with the provisional measures the Court ordered.Court Declares Bosnia Killings Were Genocide The New York Times, 26 February 2007. A copy of the ICJ judgement can be found here Milo≈°eviƒá's rule has been described as authoritarian or autocratic, as well as kleptocratic, with numerous accusations of electoral fraud, political assassinations, suppression of press freedom and police brutality. Early life Milo≈°eviƒá had ancestral roots from the Lijeva Rijeka village in Podgorica and was of the Vasojeviƒái clan from Montenegro. He was born in Po≈æarevac, four months after the Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and raised during the Axis occupation of World War II. He had an older brother Borislav who would later become a diplomat. His parents separated in the aftermath of the war. His father, the Serbian Orthodox theologian , committed suicide in 1962. Svetozar's father Simeun was an officer in the Montenegrin Army. Milo≈°eviƒá's mother Stanislava (n√©e Koljen≈°iƒá), a school teacher and also an active member of the Communist Party, committed suicide in 1972. Her brother (Milo≈°eviƒá's maternal uncle) Milisav Koljen≈°iƒá was a major-general in the Yugoslav People's Army who committed suicide in 1963. Milo≈°eviƒá went on to study law at the University of Belgrade's Law School, where he became the head of the ideology committee of the Yugoslav Communist League's (SKJ) student branch (SSOJ). While at the university, he befriended Ivan Stamboliƒá, whose uncle Petar Stamboliƒá had been a president of Serbian Executive Council (the Communist equivalent of a prime minister). This was to prove a crucial connection for Milo≈°eviƒá's career prospects, as Stamboliƒá sponsored his rise through the SKJ hierarchy. After his graduation in 1966, Milo≈°eviƒá became an economic advisor to Mayor of Belgrade Branko Pe≈°iƒá. Five years later, he married his childhood friend, Mirjana Markoviƒá, with whom he had two children: Marko and Marija. Markoviƒá would have some influence on Milo≈°eviƒá's political career both before and after his rise to power; she was also leader of her husband's junior coalition partner, Yugoslav Left (JUL) in the 1990s. In 1968, Milo≈°eviƒá got a job at the Tehnogas company, where Stamboliƒá was working, and became its chairman in 1973. By 1978, Stamboliƒá's sponsorship had enabled Milo≈°eviƒá to become the head of Beobanka, one of Yugoslavia's largest banks; his frequent trips to Paris and New York gave him the opportunity to learn English.

Milo≈°eviƒá claimed that ethnic Albanian authorities had abused their powers, that the autonomy of Kosovo was allowing the entrenchment of separatism in Kosovo, and that the rights of the Serbs in the province were being regularly violated. As a solution, he called for political change to reduce the autonomy, protect minority Serb rights, and initiate a strong crackdown on separatism in Kosovo. Milo≈°eviƒá was criticized by opponents, who claimed he and his allies were attempting to strengthen the position of Serbs in Yugoslavia at the expense of Kosovar Albanians and other nationalities, a policy they accused of being nationalist, which was a taboo in the Yugoslav Communist system and effectively a political crime, as nationalism was identified as a violation of the Yugoslav Communists' commitment to Brotherhood and Unity. Milo≈°eviƒá always denied allegations that he was a nationalist or that he exploited Serbian nationalism in his rise to power. In a 1995 interview with TIME, he defended himself from these accusations by claiming he stood for every nationality in Yugoslavia (though he made no direct or indirect mention of Macedonians or Montenegrins who are often seen by nationalist Serbs as being Serbs by ethnic heritage): \\"All my speeches up to '89 were published in my book. You can see that there was no nationalism in those speeches. We were explaining why we think it is good to preserve Yugoslavia for all Serbs, all Croats, all Muslims and all Slovenians as our joint country. Nothing else.\\" As animosity between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo deepened during the 1980s, Milo≈°eviƒá was sent to address a crowd of Serbs at the historic Kosovo field on 24 April 1987. While Milo≈°eviƒá was talking to the leadership inside the local cultural hall, demonstrators outside clashed with the local Kosovo-Albanian police force. The New York Times reported that \\"a crowd of 15,000 Serbs and Montenegrins hurled stones at the police after they used truncheons to push people away from the entrance to the cultural center of Kosovo Polje.\\"The New York Times; Protest Staged by Serbs In an Albanian Region; 26 April 1987, Sunday, Late City Final Edition Milo≈°eviƒá heard the commotion and was sent outside to calm the situation. A videotape of the event shows Milo≈°eviƒá responding to complaints from the crowd that the police were beating people by saying \\"You will not be beaten\\". Later that evening, Serbian television aired the video of Milo≈°eviƒá's encounter. In Adam LeBor's biography of Milo≈°eviƒá, he says that the crowd attacked the police and Milo≈°eviƒá's response was \\"No one should dare to beat you again!\\" The Federal Secretariat of the SFRY Interior Ministry, however, condemned the police's use of rubber truncheons as not in keeping within the provisions of Articles 100 and 101 of the rules of procedure for \\"conducting the work of law enforcement\\", they had found that \\"the total conduct of the citizenry in the mass rally before the cultural hall in Kosovo Polje cannot be assessed as negative or extremist. There was no significant violation of law and order.\\" Although Milo≈°eviƒá was only addressing a small group of people around him ‚Äì not the public, a great deal of significance has been attached to that remark. Stamboliƒá, after his reign as President, said that he had seen that day as \\"the end of Yugoslavia\\". Dragi≈°a Pavloviƒá, a Stamboliƒá ally and Milo≈°eviƒá's successor at the head of the Belgrade Committee of the party, was expelled from the party during the 8th Session of the League of Communists of Serbia after he publicly criticized the party's Kosovo policy.

Stamboliƒá was accused of sending a secret letter to the party Presidium, in what was seen as an attempt to misuse the weight of his position as Serbian president, to prevent the central committee's vote on Pavloviƒá's expulsion from the party.BBC Summary of World Broadcasts; BELGRADE COMMUNISTS GIVE VIEWS ON STAMBOLIC'S RELATIONS WITH DRAGISA PAVLOVIC; 27 November 1987; SOURCE: Belgrade home service 2100 gmt 24 November 1987Xinhua; 14 December 1987; Leader of Yugoslavia's Serbia Republic Sacked; ITEM NO: 1214003 In 2002, Adam LeBor and Louis Sell would write that Pavloviƒá was really dismissed because he opposed Milo≈°eviƒá's policies towards Kosovo-Serbs. They contend that, contrary to advice from Stamboliƒá, Milo≈°eviƒá had denounced Pavloviƒá as being soft on Albanian radicals. LeBor and Sell assert that Milo≈°eviƒá prepared the ground for his ascent to power by quietly replacing Stamboliƒá's supporters with his own people, thereby forcing Pavloviƒá and Stamboliƒá from power. In February 1988, Stamboliƒá's resignation was formalized, allowing Milo≈°eviƒá to take his place as Serbia's president. Milo≈°eviƒá then initiated a program of IMF- supported free-market reforms, setting up in May 1988 the \\"Milo≈°eviƒá Commission\\" comprising Belgrade's leading neoliberal economists. Anti- bureaucratic revolution Starting in 1988, the anti-bureaucratic revolution led to the resignation of the governments of Vojvodina and Montenegro and to the election of officials allied with Milo≈°eviƒá. According to the ICTY indictment against Milo≈°eviƒá: \\"From July 1988 to March 1989, a series of demonstrations and rallies supportive of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's policies ‚Äì the 'Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution' ‚Äì took place in Vojvodina and Montenegro. These protests led to the ousting of the respective provincial and republican governments; the new governments were then supportive of, and indebted to, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá.\\" Milo≈°eviƒá's supporters say the anti-bureaucratic revolution was an authentic grass-roots political movement. Reacting to the indictment, Dr. Branko Kostiƒá, Montenegro's then-representative on the Yugoslav state presidency said, \\"Well, it sounds like nonsense to me. If a government or a leadership were supportive of Milo≈°eviƒá, then it would be normal for him to feel indebted to them, not the other way around.\\" He said Milo≈°eviƒá enjoyed genuine grassroots support because \\"his name at that time shone brightly on the political arena of the entire federal Yugoslavia ... and many people saw him as a person who would be finally able to make things move, to get things going.\\" Kosta Bulatoviƒá, an organizer of the anti-bureaucratic rallies, said \\"All of this was spontaneous\\"; the motivation to protest was \\"coming from the grassroots.\\" Milo≈°eviƒá's critics claim that he cynically planned and organized the anti-bureaucratic revolution to strengthen his political power. Stjepan Mesiƒá, who served as the last president of a united Yugoslavia (in the prelude of these events), said that Milo≈°eviƒá, \\"with the policy he waged, broke down the autonomous [government in] Vojvodina, which was legally elected, [and] in Montenegro he implemented an anti-bureaucratic revolution, as it's called, by which he destroyed Yugoslavia.\\" Commenting on Milo≈°eviƒá's role, Slovene president Milan Kuƒçan said, \\"none of us believed in Slovenia that these were spontaneous meetings and rallies.\\" He accused the Serbian government of deliberately fanning nationalist passions, and Slovene newspapers published articles comparing Milo≈°eviƒá to Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, a one-time socialist who turned to nationalism. Milo≈°eviƒá contended that such criticism was unfounded and amounted to \\"spreading fear of Serbia\\".Communism O Nationalism!, TIME Magazine, 24 October 1988 In Vojvodina, where 54 percent of the population was Serb, an estimated 100,000 demonstrators rallied outside the Communist Party headquarters in Novi Sad on 6 October 1988 to demand the resignation of the provincial leadership. The majority of protesters were workers from the town of Baƒçka Palanka, 40 kilometres west of Novi Sad. They were supportive of Milo≈°eviƒá and opposed the provincial government's moves to block forthcoming amendments to the Serbian constitution.Xinhua; 6 October 1988; Yugoslav Protesters Demand Provincial Leaders' Resignation; ITEM NO: 1006181The Times (London); 7 October 1988, Friday; Angry Serbs topple the leadership of Vojvodina province; Demonstrations against the Communist Party; YugoslaviaThe Globe and Mail (Canada); 6 October 1988 Thursday; Yugoslavs demand new leader The New York Times reported that the demonstrations were held \\"with the support of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá\\" and that \\"Diplomats and Yugoslavs speculated about whether Mr. Milo≈°eviƒá, whose hold over crowds [was] great, had had a hand in organizing the Novi Sad demonstrations.\\" The demonstrations were successful.

In the early to mid-1980s, claims were made of a mass exodus of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo as a result of Albanian riots. Serbian nationalists denounced the 1974 Yugoslav constitution and demands for change were strong among Kosovar Serbs. In 1986 Serbian President Ivan Stamboliƒá responded by accepting this position, declaring that the 1974 constitution was contrary to the interests of Serbs, though he warned that \\"certain individuals\\" were \\"coquetting\\" with Serbian nationalism. Stamboliƒá established a commission to amend the Serbian constitution in keeping with conclusions adopted by the federal Communist Party. The constitutional commission worked for three years to harmonize its positions and in 1989 an amended Serbian constitution was submitted to the governments of Kosovo, Vojvodina and Serbia for approval. On 10 March 1989, the Vojvodina Assembly approved the amendments, followed by the Kosovo Assembly on 23 March, and the Serbian Assembly on 28 March.BBC Summary of World Broadcasts; 16 March 1989, Thursday; PARTY AND GOVERNMENT Vojvodina agrees to Serbian constitutional changes; SOURCE: Excerpts Yugoslav News Agency in English 1815 gmt 10 March 1989BBC Summary of World Broadcasts; 24 March 1989, Friday; Kosovo Assembly adopts changes to Serbian ConstitutionThe Washington Post; 29 March 1989, Final Edition; 21 Dead in Two Days Of Yugoslav Rioting; Federal Assembly Ratifies Changes at Issue In the Kosovo Assembly 187 of the 190 assembly members were present when the vote was taken: 10 voted against the amendments, two abstained, and the remaining 175 voted in favor of the amendments.Xinhua; 23 MARCH 1989; Kosovo adopts constitutional changes Although the ethnic composition of the Kosovo Assembly was over 70 percent Albanian, they were forced to vote in favor of the amendments while under the careful watch of the newly arrived Serbian police forces.

The boycott soon included education on Albanian language in Kosovo which Milo≈°eviƒá attempted to resolve by signing the Milo≈°eviƒá-Rugova education agreement in 1996. The anti-bureaucratic revolutions in Montenegro and Vojvodina coupled with the Albanian boycott in Kosovo effectively meant that Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and his supporters held power in four out of the eight republics and autonomous provinces that made-up the Yugoslav federation. Whether this was cynically engineered by Milo≈°eviƒá is a matter of controversy between his critics and his supporters. Because Milo≈°eviƒá's supporters controlled half of the votes in the SFRY presidency, his critics charge that he undermined the Yugoslav federation. This, his detractors argue, upset the balance of power in Yugoslavia and provoked separatism elsewhere in the federation. Milo≈°eviƒá's supporters contend that the representatives of the SFRY presidency were elected according to the law. They say that Milo≈°eviƒá enjoyed genuine popular support so it was perfectly logical for his allies to be elected to the presidency. His supporters dismiss allegations that he upset the balance of power in Yugoslavia as a propaganda ploy designed to justify separatism. In 1990, after other republics abandoned the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and adopted democratic multiparty systems, Milo≈°eviƒá's government quickly followed suit and the 1990 Serbian Constitution was created. The 1990 Constitution officially renamed the Socialist Republic of Serbia to the Republic of Serbia and abandoned the one-party communist system and created a democratic multiparty system. After the creation of a multiparty system in Serbia, Milo≈°eviƒá and his political allies in Serbia elsewhere in Yugoslavia pushed for the creation of a democratic multiparty system of government at the federal level, such as Serbian state media appealing to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina in early 1992 with the promise that Bosnia and Herzegovina could peacefully coexist in a democratic Yugoslav federation alongside the republics of Serbia and Montenegro. In the aftermath, Serbia and Montenegro agreed to create the new Yugoslav federation called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992, which dismantled the remaining communist infrastructure and created a federal democratic multiparty system of government. Economic policies Milo≈°eviƒá's advocated a synthesis of socialist and liberal economic policies that would gradually transition Serbia from a planned economy to a mixed economy.Sini≈°a Male≈°eviƒá.

During the first democratic election in Serbia, Milo≈°eviƒá promised to protect industrial workers from the adverse effects of free market policies by maintaining social ownership of the economy and supporting trade barriers in order to protect local industries. Despite this, many accused Milo≈°eviƒá of creating a kleptocracy by transferring ownership much of the industrial and financial sector to his political allies and financiers. Under heavy economic sanctions from the United Nations due to Milo≈°eviƒá's perceived role in the Yugoslav wars, Serbia's economy began a prolonged period of economic collapse and isolation. The National Bank of FR Yugoslavia's war-related easy money policies contributed to hyperinflation which reached an alarming rate of 313 million percent in January 1994. According to the World Bank, Serbia's economy contracted by 27.2 and 30.5 percent in 1992 and 1993 respectively. In response to the deteriorating situation, World Bank economist Dragoslav Avramoviƒá was nominated the governor of the National Bank of the FR Yugoslavia in March 1994. Avramoviƒá began monetary reforms that ended hyperinflation and returned the Serbian economy to economic growth by giving the Yugoslav Dinar a 1:1 parity with the Deutsche Mark. Milo≈°eviƒá's role in the signing of the Dayton Accords allowed the lifting of most economic sanctions, but the FR Yugoslavia was still not allowed access to financial and foreign aid due to the perceived oppression of Albanians in Kosovo. The Serbian economy began growing from the period of 1994‚Äì1998, at one point even reaching a growth rate of 10.1 percent in 1997. However, this growth rate was not sufficient enough to return Serbia to its pre-war economic status. In order to pay out pensions and wages, Milo≈°eviƒá's socialist government had no choice but to begin selling off Serbia's most profitable telecommunications, which gave the federal government about $1.05 billion more in revenue. In 1998, Milo≈°evic promised to introduce a new economic program which would begin a process of market reforms, reduction of trade barriers, and the privatization of more state owned enterprises in order to achieve an economic growth rate of 10%. However, this plan was never implemented due to the Kosovo war, the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and his subsequent overthrow in October 2000. Civil and political rights under Milo≈°eviƒá Milo≈°eviƒá's government policies on civil and political rights when serving as Serbian President and later Yugoslav president were controversial. Milo≈°eviƒá's government exercised influence and censorship in the media. An example was in March 1991, when Serbia's Public Prosecutor ordered a 36-hour blackout of two independent media stations, B92 Radio and Studio B television to prevent the broadcast of a demonstration against the Serbian government taking place in Belgrade. The two media stations appealed to the Public Prosecutor against the ban but the Public Prosecutor failed to respond. Upon the creation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Milo≈°eviƒá's government engaged in reforms to the Serbian Penal Code regarding restrictions on free speech, which were seen by critics as highly authoritarian. In particular Article 98 of the Serbian Penal Code during the 1990s punished imprisonment of up to three years for the following: The federal criminal code for Yugoslavia also protected the presidents of federal institutions, the Yugoslav Army and federal emblems. Both the Serbian and federal Yugoslav laws granted limited exemptions to journalists. The result was multiple charges against a variety of people opposed to the policies of the Serbian and Yugoslav governments even including a Serbian cartoonist who designed political satire. Role in the Yugoslav Wars The Hague indictment alleges that, starting in 1987, Milo≈°eviƒá \\"endorsed a Serbian nationalist agenda\\" and \\"exploited a growing wave of Serbian nationalism in order to strengthen centralised rule in the SFRY\\". ICTY prosecutors argued that \\"the (Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo) indictments were all part of a common scheme, strategy or plan on the part of the accused Milo≈°eviƒá to create a Greater Serbia, a centralized Serbian state encompassing the Serb-populated areas of Croatia and Bosnia and all of Kosovo, and that this plan was to be achieved by forcibly removing non-Serbs from large geographical areas through the commission of the crimes charged in the indictments. Although the events in Kosovo were separated from those in Croatia and Bosnia by more than three years, they were no more than a continuation of that plan, and they could only be understood completely by reference to what had happened in Croatia and Bosnia.\\"Decision of the ICTY Appeals Chamber; 18 April 2002; Reasons for the Decision on Prosecution Interlocutory Appeal from Refusal to Order Joinder; Paragraph 8 Milo≈°eviƒá's defenders claim that the Prosecution could not produce a single order issued by his government to Serbian fighters in Croatia or Bosnia. Near the end of the Prosecution's case, a Prosecution analyst admitted under cross-examination that this was indeed the case. Theunens, however, was quick to point out, \\"the fact that we don't have orders doesn't mean that they don't exist\\" to which Milo≈°eviƒá replied \\"There are none, that's why you haven't got one.\\" Since the wars, Milo≈°eviƒá's political behavior has been analyzed as politically opportunist in nature. Claims that Milo≈°eviƒá was principally motivated by a desire for power have been supported by many people who had known or had worked for him. Some believe his original goal until the breakup of Yugoslavia was to take control of Yugoslavia, with the ambition of becoming its next great leader, a \\"second Tito\\". According to this, Milo≈°eviƒá exploited nationalism as a tool to seize power in Serbia, while not holding any particular commitment to it. During the first twenty-five years of his political career in the communist government of Yugoslavia, Milo≈°eviƒá was a typical civil servant who did not appear to have nationalist aims. Later, he attempted to present himself as a peacemaker in the Yugoslav Wars and abandoned support of nationalism. He returned to support nationalism during the Kosovo War and appealed to anti-imperialist sentiments. The spread of violent nationalism has also been imputed to indifference to it by Milo≈°eviƒá. The source of Milo≈°eviƒá's nationalistic agenda is believed to have been influenced by the policies of the popular prominent Serbian Communist official and former Yugoslav Partisan Aleksandar Rankoviƒá who was known to promote Serbian national interests in Yugoslavia and tougher police actions against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. He supported a centralized Yugoslavia and opposed efforts that promoted decentralization that he deemed to be against the interests of Serb unity. Rankoviƒá imposed harsh repressive measures on Kosovar Albanians based on accusations that they there were sympathizers of the Stalinist rule of Enver Hoxha in Albania.Independent International Commission on Kosovo. The Kosovo report: conflict, international response, lessons learned. New York, New York, US: Oxford University Press, 2000. p. 35. In 1956, a show trial in Pristina was held in which multiple Albanian Communists of Kosovo were convicted of being infiltrators from Albania and were given long prison sentences. Rankoviƒá sought to secure the position of the Serbs in Kosovo and gave them dominance in Kosovo's nomenklatura. Under Rankoviƒá's influence, Islam in Kosovo at this time was repressed and both Albanians and ethnically Slavic Muslims were encouraged to declare themselves to be Turkish and emigrate to Turkey. At the same time, Serbs and Montenegrins dominated the government, security forces, and industrial employment in Kosovo. The popularity of Rankoviƒá's nationalistic policies in Serbia became apparent during his funeral in Serbia in 1983 where large numbers of people attended while considering Rankoviƒá a Serbian \\"national\\" leader. This event is believed to have possibly influenced Milo≈°eviƒá, who attended Rankoviƒá's funeral, to recognize the popularity of Rankoviƒá's agenda. This connection to the legacy of Rankoviƒá was recognized by a number of Yugoslavs who regarded Milo≈°eviƒá's policies upon his to power in Serbia as effectively \\"bringing Rankoviƒá back in\\". During the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution, Milo≈°eviƒá urged Serbians and Montenegrins to \\"take to the streets\\" and utilized the slogan \\"Strong Serbia, Strong Yugoslavia\\" that drew support from Serbs and Montenegrins but alienated the other Yugoslav nations. To these groups, Milo≈°eviƒá's agenda reminded them of the Serb hegemonic political affairs of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Rankoviƒá's policies. Milo≈°eviƒá appealed to nationalist and populist passion by speaking of Serbia's importance to the world and in a Belgrade speech on 19 November 1988, he spoke of Serbia as facing battles against both internal and external enemies. In Vojvodina, a mob of pro-Milo≈°eviƒá demonstrators that included 500 Kosovo Serbs and local Serbs demonstrated at the provincial capital, accusing the leadership in Vojvodina of supporting separatism and for being \\"traitors\\". In August 1988, meetings by supporters of the Anti- Bureaucratic Revolution were held in many locations in Serbia and Montenegro, with increasingly violent nature, with calls being heard such as \\"Give us arms!\\", \\"We want weapons!\\", \\"Long live Serbia‚Äîdeath to Albanians!\\", and \\"Montenegro is Serbia!\\". In the same month, Milo≈°eviƒá began efforts designed to destabilize the governments in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina to allow him to install his followers in those republics. By 1989, Milo≈°eviƒá and his supporters controlled Central Serbia along with the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, supporters in the leadership of Montenegro, and agents of the Serbian security service were pursuing efforts to destabilize the government in Bosnia & Herzegovina. The new government of Montenegro led by Momir Bulatoviƒá was seen by some as a satellite of Serbia.Sabrina P. Ramet. Serbia Since 1989: Politics and Society Under MilosÃÜeviƒá and After.

In 1989, the Serbian media began to speak of \\"the alleged imperilment of the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina\\", as tensions between Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats increased over Serb support for Milo≈°eviƒá. Efforts to spread the cult of personality of Milo≈°eviƒá into the republic of Macedonia began in 1989 with the introduction of slogans, graffiti, and songs glorifying Milo≈°eviƒá. Furthermore, Milo≈°eviƒá proposed a law to restore land titles held by Serbs in the interwar period that effectively provided a legal basis for large numbers of Serbs to move to Kosovo and Macedonia to regain those lands. Beginning in 1989, Milo≈°eviƒá gave support to Croatian Serbs who were vouching for the creation of an autonomous province for Croatian Serbs, which was opposed by Croatian communist authorities. In the late 1980s, Milo≈°eviƒá allowed the mobilization of Serb nationalist organizations to go unhindered by actions from the Serbian government, with Chetniks holding demonstrations, and the Serbian government embracing the Serbian Orthodox Church and restored its legitimacy in Serbia. Croatia and Slovenia denounced Milo≈°eviƒá's actions and began to demand that Yugoslavia be made a full multi-party confederal state. Milo≈°eviƒá claimed that he opposed a confederal system but also declared that a confederal system be created, with the external borders of Serbia being an \\"open question\\". Tensions between the republics escalated to crisis beginning in 1988, with Slovenia accusing Serbia of pursuing Stalinism while Serbia accused Slovenia of betrayal. Serbs boycotted Slovene products and Belgraders began removing their savings from the Slovenian Bank of Ljubljana. Slovenia accused Serbia of persecuting Kosovar Albanians and declared its solidarity with the Kosovar Albanian people while Milo≈°eviƒá in turn, accused Slovenia of being a \\"lackey\\" of Western Europe. In response to the escalating tensions, Croatia expressed support for Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its neutrality, while Montenegro supported Serbia. Slovenia reformed its constitution in 1989 that declared Slovenia's right to secession. These changes provoked accusations by the Serbian media that the changes were \\"destabilizing\\". Serbia's response was a plan to hold demonstrations in Ljubljana with 30,000 to 40,000 Serbs to supposedly inform Slovenes about the situation in Kosovo, while this was suspected to be an action aimed at destabilizing the Slovene government. Croatia and Slovenia prevented the Serb protesters from crossing by train into Slovenia. Serbia responded by breaking political links between the two republics and 329 Serbian businesses broke ties with Slovenia. With these events in 1989, nationalism soared in response along with acts of intolerance, discrimination, and ethnic violence increasing. In that year, officials from Bosnia and Herzegovina noted rising tensions between Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs; active rumors spread of incidents between Croats and Serbs and arguments by Croats and Serbs that Bosniaks were not a real nation escalated. With the collapse of the Yugoslav Communist Party, multiparty elections were held in Serbia in 1990, with a number of nationalist parties running on the agenda of creating a Greater Serbia as Yugoslavia fell apart. From 1990 onward, as Serbs in Croatia pushed for autonomy and began to arm themselves, the Serbian state-run newspaper Politika denounced the Croatian government of Franjo Tuƒëman for allegedly \\"trying to restore the World War II-era Usta≈°e regime\\" and for \\"copying Tito\\", and pledged that Belgrade would support the Serbs of Croatia. The Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) began providing weapons to the Serbs in Croatia while the situation in Belgrade grew more intense as Serbs demonstrated outside of the parliament, shouting \\"We want arms\\" and \\"Let's go to Croatia!\\". Milo≈°eviƒá and other members of the Serbian leadership in the 1980s attempted to gain support among Serb nationalists by appealing to revisionism of the history of Yugoslavia in World War II. To do this, the Tito-era tradition of focusing on rallying the population of Yugoslavia in remembering the total casualties of Yugoslavs in World War II at the hands of Axis forces was replaced with the Milo≈°eviƒá government's focus on remembering the Serb casualties of World War II as victims of the Croatian Usta≈°e. This attempt to gain nationalist support also had the effect of increasing the radicalization of Serbian nationalism. In the late 1980s, conspiracy theories that vilified the Roman Catholic Church began to become widespread and were supported by Serbian publishers. This was of particular significance since these were attacks on the national religion of the Croats. The political climate in Serbia and Serb territories fostered the rise of ultranationalism and created tense and, at times, violent confrontations between Serbs themselves, particularly between nationalist Serbs and non-nationalist Serbs. Serbs who publicly opposed the nationalist agenda were reported to have been harassed, threatened, or killed. The Serbian media during Milo≈°eviƒá's era was known to espouse Serb nationalism and patriotism, while promoting xenophobia toward the other ethnicities in Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians were commonly characterised in the media as anti- Yugoslav counter-revolutionaries, rapists, and a threat to the Serb nation. The Serbian state-run newspaper Politika had a number of xenophobic headlines such as in 1991, saying \\"The ≈†iptars [Albanians] are watching and waiting\\". The newspaper also attacked Croats for the election of Franjo Tuƒëman as president, saying that the \\"Croatian leadership again shames the Croatian people\\". It attempted to assert that Croats and ethnic Albanians were cooperating in a campaign against the Serbian government during the 1991 protests in Belgrade against Milo≈°eviƒá's government, denying that Serbs took part in the protest while claiming \\"it was the ≈†iptars and Croats who demonstrated\\". When war erupted in Croatia, Politika promoted Serb nationalism, hostility towards Croatia, and violence, and on 2 April 1991, the newspaper's headline read \\"Krajina decides to join Serbia\\". One of the newspaper's stories was \\"Serbian unity‚Äîsaving Krajina\\". On 5 June 1991, Politika ekpres ran a piece titled \\"Serbs must get weapons\\". On 25 June 1991 and 3 July 1991, Politika began to openly promote partitioning Croatia, saying \\"We can't accept Croatia keeping these borders\\", \\"Krajina in the same state with Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina\\", and prominently quoted Jovan Marjanoviƒá of the Serbian Renewal Movement, who said \\"The [Yugoslav] Army must come into Croatia and occupy the line Benkovac-Karlovac-Pakrac-Baranja\\", which would essentially have occupied almost all of Croatia and all the territories in Croatia that were claimed by nationalist promoters of a Greater Serbia. To promote fear and anger among Serbs towards Croatia, on 25 June 1991, Politika reminded Serbs about the atrocities by the Croatian fascist Usta≈°e against Serbs during World War II by saying \\"Jasenovac [an Ustase concentration camp in World War II] mustn't be forgotten\\". According to Borisav Joviƒá, who was formerly a close Milo≈°eviƒá ally, Milo≈°eviƒá exercised media censorship and maintained strong personal influence over Serbia's state media outlets, having \\"personally appointed editors-in-chief of newspapers and news programs ...\\". Serbian state media during the wars featured controversial reportage that villainized the other ethnic factions. In one such program, a Croatian Serb woman denounced the old \\"communist policy\\" in Croatia, claiming that under it \\"[t]he majority of Serbs would be assimilated in ten years\\", while another interviewee stated \\"Where Serbian blood was shed by Usta≈°a knives, there will be our boundaries.\\" Various Serbian state television reports featured a guest speaker, Jovan Ra≈°koviƒá, who claimed that the Croat people had a \\"genocidal nature\\". These repeatedly negative media depictions of the opposing ethnic factions have been said to have been examples of Milo≈°eviƒá's state media promoting fear-mongering and utilizing xenophobic nationalist sentiments to draw Serbs to support the wars. The director of Radio Television of Serbia during Milo≈°eviƒá's era, Du≈°an Miteviƒá, has since admitted on a PBS documentary \\"the things that happened at state TV, warmongering, things we can admit to now: false information, biased reporting. That went directly from Milo≈°eviƒá to the head of TV. Milo≈°eviƒá was uninterested in maintaining Slovenia within the Yugoslav federation, as Slovenia had very few Serbs living within it and Milo≈°eviƒá suggested a political deal with Slovene president Kuƒçan, Serbia would recognize the right of the self-determination of the Slovene nation to independence if Slovenia in turn recognized the right of self-determination of the Serb nation to remain united with Serbia. Such a deal would have set a precedent for Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia to remain in one state with Serbia. Milo≈°eviƒá's ally in the Yugoslav federal government, Borisav Joviƒá stated \\"I put it bluntly. We didn't want a war with Slovenia. Serbia had no territorial claims there. It was an ethnically-pure republic ‚Äì no Serbs. We couldn't care less if they left Yugoslavia ... We would have been overstretched. With Slovenia out of the way, we could dictate terms to the Croats.\\" Milo≈°eviƒá rejected the independence of Croatia in 1991, and even after the formation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), it too did not initially recognize Croatia's independence. Plans by Milo≈°eviƒá to carve out territory from Croatia to the local Serbs had begun by June 1990, according to the diary of Borisav Joviƒá. The Serbian government along with a clique of pro-Milo≈°eviƒá members of the Yugoslav army and its general staff, secretly adopted the RAM or \\"frame\\" plan that involved the partition of Croatia and Bosnia to give large amounts of territory to the local Serbs that would remain united with Serbia, effectively a Greater Serbia. Armaments and military equipment were placed in strategic positions throughout Croatia and Bosnia for use by the Serbs and local Serbs were trained as police and paramilitary soldiers in preparation for war. Milo≈°eviƒá was less interested in annexing the Serb breakaway republic of Krajina. According to testimony by Krajina's former President Milan Babiƒá, Milo≈°eviƒá had abandoned plans of having \\"all Serbs in one state\\" by March 1991 in the secret Karaƒëorƒëevo agreement with Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman that discussed the partition of Bosnia. Babiƒá attended the meeting and noted that Milo≈°eviƒá stated that \\"Tuƒëman needs Bihaƒá\\" ‚Äì a city in Bosnia that was separated by Serbian Krajina from Croatian government-controlled territory in Croatia; and then added \\"He needs a road between Benkovac and Drni≈° as well\\" that would involve the road going through territory claimed by Krajina. Upon the Yugoslav republic of Macedonia seceding in 1991, the Yugoslav government declared Macedonia an \\"artificial nation\\" and it allied with Greece against the country, even suggesting a partition of the Republic of Macedonia between Yugoslavia and Greece. Subsequent interviews with government officials involved in these affairs have revealed that Milo≈°eviƒá planned to arrest the Republic of Macedonia's political leadership and replace it with politicians loyal to him. Milo≈°eviƒá demanded the self-determination of Serbs in the Republic of Macedonia and did not recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia until 1996. Despite the bitterness towards the Macedonian nation whose locals rejected Yugoslav assertions of Serbian ethnicity, the FR Yugoslavia would recognize the Republic of Macedonia in 1996. Four years before this milestone, however, Yugoslav troops and remnants of Belgrade's central government had peacefully and voluntarily left Macedonian territory. Milo≈°eviƒá denounced the declaration of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia in 1992, and said that \\"Bosnia and Herzegovina was illegally proclaimed as an independent state and recognized. That recognition was like when the Roman Emperor Caligula appointed his horse as a Senator: they recognized a state that never existed before. The Serbs there said, 'We want to stay within Yugoslavia. We don't want to be second-class citizens.' And then the conflicts were started by Muslims, no doubt. And the Serbs, in defending themselves, were always better fighters, no doubt. And they achieved results, no doubt. But please, we were insisting on peace. The international community gave premature recognition first of Slovenia and then of Croatia and supported the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina on a totally irregular basis.\\" A telephone conversation between Milo≈°eviƒá and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karad≈æiƒá in September 1991 talking about the prospects of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was tapped by Yugoslav intelligence, which reported the transcript to Yugoslav prime minister Ante Markoviƒá, who released the transcript to the public to discredit Milo≈°eviƒá. The transcript involved Milo≈°eviƒá ordering Karad≈æiƒá to \\"Go to Uzelac [JNA commander in northern Bosnia], he'll tell you everything. If you have any problems, telephone me\\", and said \\"As long as there is the army no one can touch us ... Don't worry about Herzegovina. Momir [Bulatoviƒá, Montenegrin leader] said to his men: 'Whoever is not ready to die in Bosnia, step forward five paces.' No one did so.\\" The conversation revealed that Milo≈°eviƒá controlled the military strategy for the war in Bosnia and that Montenegro was under his control. Milo≈°eviƒá signing the Dayton Accords in 1995 on behalf of the Bosnian Serb leadership, formally ending the Bosnian War. Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj, leader of the Serbian Radical Party and a Serbian paramilitary leader during the Yugoslav wars, claimed that Milo≈°eviƒá was directly involved in supporting his paramilitaries and controlled Serb forces during the wars: \\"Milo≈°eviƒá organized everything. We gathered the volunteers and he gave us a special barracks, Bubanj Potok, all our uniforms, arms, military technology and buses. All our units were always under the command of the Krajina [Serb army] or [Bosnian] Republika Srpska Army or the JNA. Of course I don't believe he signed anything, these were verbal orders. None of our talks was taped and I never took a paper and pencil when I talked with him. His key people were the commanders. Nothing could happen on the Serbian side without Milo≈°eviƒá's order or his knowledge.\\" Although direct orders to commit atrocities by Milo≈°eviƒá have never been discovered, he made little or no effort to punish people deemed responsible for such atrocities, including Ratko Mladiƒá who, after being accused of allowing atrocities to occur against Croats in Vukovar, was sent to lead the Army of the Republika Srpska, in which capacity Mladiƒá was accused of ordering atrocities, including the murder of thousands of Bosniak men and boys in Srebrenica. Even after the reports of Srebrenica were released, Milo≈°eviƒá refused to accept that Mladiƒá was responsible for the crimes he was accused of. Wesley Clark, who was a member of the US team that helped negotiate the 1995 peace agreement ending the Bosnian War, claimed in his testimony during the trial of Milo≈°eviƒá that Milo≈°eviƒá had prior knowledge of the Srebrenica massacre and knew of Mladiƒá's plans. During the negotiations, Clark had asked Milo≈°eviƒá: 'Mr. President, you say you have so much influence over the Bosnian Serbs, but how is it then, if you have such influence, that you allowed General Mladiƒá to kill all those people in Srebrenica?' with Milo≈°eviƒá answering: 'Well, General Clark ... I warned Mladiƒá not to do this, but he didn't listen to me.'\\" Following the rise of nationalism and political tensions after Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá came to power, as well as the outbreaks of the Yugoslav Wars, numerous anti-war movements developed in Serbia. The anti- war protests in Belgrade were held mostly because of opposition the Battle of Vukovar, Siege of Dubrovnik and Siege of Sarajevo, while protesters demanded the referendum on a declaration of war and disruption of military conscription. It is estimated that between 50,000 and 200,000 people deserted from the Milo≈°eviƒá-controlled Yugoslav People's Army during wars, while between 100,000 and 150,000 people emigrated from Serbia refusing to participate in the war. According to professor Renaud De la Brosse, senior lecturer at the University of Reims and a witness called by the ICTY, it is surprising how great the resistance to Milo≈°eviƒá's propaganda was among Serbs, given that and the lack of access to alternative news. Political scientists Orli Fridman described that not enough attention was given to anti-war activism among scholars studying the breakup of Yugoslavia and the wars, as well as that independent media and anti-war groups from Serbia did not attract the international attention. Personal views A large number of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's interviews have been collected online by his supporters. Milo≈°eviƒá argued that the Yugoslav Constitution gave self-determination to constitutive nations, not to republics and Serbs were constitutive nation in both the Socialistic Republic of Croatia and the Socialistic Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina. On this basis, he stated that the Croatian Serbs and later the Bosnian Serbs should not have been subject to the declarations of independence by the Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Milo≈°eviƒá denied that Serbia was at war, even though Serbia's military involvement was evident during the wars in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia in particular. Milo≈°eviƒá was President of Serbia, not of Yugoslavia, and claims that his government was only indirectly involved through support for Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia at some points. Others including former members of his cabinet such as Borisav Joviƒá have admitted that Milo≈°eviƒá, while not head of state of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, in fact played a key role in the military affairs taken in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia. This included a scheme discussed and designed by both Joviƒá and Milo≈°eviƒá that transferred every Bosnian Serb unit from the Yugoslav army (JNA) to the newly formed Bosnian Serb army upon Bosnia's separation from Yugoslavia, which meant that Yugoslavia could not be criticized for occupying parts of Bosnia as it was officially a civil war, although Joviƒá admitted that the Bosnian Serb Army was fully funded by Belgrade because the Bosnian Serb military budget was too small to support such an army.Death of Yugoslavia. British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). 1995. Milo≈°eviƒá spent most of 1988 and 1989 focusing his politics on the \\"Kosovo problem\\". In Kosovo, to seem non-contradictory, Milo≈°eviƒá alleged that he supported the right of the Albanians to \\"self- determination\\", but not to independence, as he claimed that Kosovo was an essential part of Serbia due to its history and its numerous churches and cultural relics. He also claimed that the KLA were a neo-Nazi organisation that sought an ethnically pure Kosovo, and he argued that independence would deliver Kosovo to their hands. Milo≈°eviƒá denies that he gave orders to massacre Albanians in 1998. He claims that the deaths were sporadic events confined to rural areas of West Kosovo committed by paramilitaries and by rebels in the armed forces. Those from the Serbian army or police who were involved were all, he claims, arrested and many were sentenced to long prison sentences. The former United States ambassador to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmermann, during his conversations with Milo≈°eviƒá claimed that he was not a genuine nationalist, but rather a political opportunist. Zimmerman has claimed that unlike other politicians with whom he had discussions during the collapse of Yugoslavia, such as Franjo Tuƒëman and Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, Milo≈°eviƒá did not emphasize any hatred of ethnic groups and instead emphasized that Serbia would continue to be a multi-ethnic republic in Yugoslavia. Zimmerman has claimed that Milo≈°eviƒá opportunistically used nationalism to allow him to rise to power in the Communist establishment in Serbia as Communism in eastern Europe became increasingly unpopular, and continued to advocate a nationalist agenda to draw in support for his government. On another occasion, however, Milo≈°eviƒá revealed to Zimmerman his negative attitude towards ethnic Albanians who had demanded autonomy and in the 1990s, independence from Serbia and Yugoslavia. Milo≈°eviƒá told Zimmerman jokingly that the Albanians of Kosovo were the most pampered minority in Europe. Milo≈°eviƒá also was known to talk disparagingly about Slovenes, when he in conversation with an interviewer of what he thought of the Slovene delegation's decision to depart the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Milo≈°eviƒá made a derogatory joke, calling the Slovene League of Communists delegation, \\"those stingy Slovenes\\". Zimmerman later reported that Milo≈°eviƒá's unusual and conflicting positions and mannerisms were almost schizophrenic in nature, as at times Milo≈°eviƒá would behave in an arrogant, stubborn, authoritarian and aggressive manner towards others, which staunchly supported Serbian nationalism against all opponents, while at other times he would be polite, conciliatory, and be eager and willing to find moderate and peaceful solutions to the crisis in Yugoslavia. Zimmerman has concluded, however, that Milo≈°eviƒá constantly demonstrated that he primarily saw Yugoslavia as a state for ensuring the unity of Serbs, and did not have much interest in preserving the unity of Yugoslavia outside areas of Serb national interests. Milo≈°eviƒá's personality according to others has indicated a similar double-sided nature as U.S. ambassador Zimmerman has claimed. In public appearances, he would appear strong, confident, bold and serious while in private, it is said that Milo≈°eviƒá was very laid back, and according to the former director of Politika, Had≈æi Dragan Antiƒá, Milo≈°eviƒá was often interested in non-political things such as comic strips and Disney cartoons and admired the music of Frank Sinatra. Milo≈°eviƒá only allowed a close inner circle of personal friends to visit him while others including the former Information Minister of Serbia during Milo≈°eviƒá's era, Aleksandar Tijaniƒá have said that in private Milo≈°eviƒá demonstrated elements of paranoia to many people outside of his inner circle, such as demanding that Tijaniƒá remove the battery from his mobile-phone on each occasion that Tijaniƒá met him. Milo≈°eviƒá also refused to keep notes on talks on important issues and would only meet with his most trusted allies, to whom he simply gave directions and instructions without engaging in substantial discussion. Murders of political opponents In the summer of 2000, former Serbian President Ivan Stamboliƒá was kidnapped; his body was found in 2003 and Milo≈°eviƒá was charged with ordering his murder. In 2005, several members of the Serbian secret police and criminal gangs were convicted in Belgrade for a number of murders, including Stamboliƒá's. These were the same people who arrested Milo≈°eviƒá in April 2001. Later, Interior Minister Du≈°an Mihajloviƒá denied that Milo≈°eviƒá had been involved in Stamboliƒá's death at Fru≈°ka Gora. In June 2006, the Supreme Court of Serbia ruled that Milo≈°eviƒá had ordered the murder of Stamboliƒá, accepting the previous ruling of the Special Court for Organized Crime in Belgrade, which targeted Milo≈°eviƒá as the main abettor of politically motivated murders in the 1990s. Milo≈°eviƒá's attorneys said the Court's ruling was of little value because he was never formally charged or given an opportunity to defend himself against the accusations. Moreover, most of these murders were of government officials, such as high police official Radovan Stojiƒçiƒá, Defence Minister Pavle Bulatoviƒá, and the director of JAT ≈Ωika Petroviƒá. Downfall Milo≈°eviƒá meets with US President Bill Clinton in Paris on 14 December 1995 On 4 February 1997, Milo≈°eviƒá recognized the opposition victories in some local elections, after mass protests lasting 96 days. Constitutionally limited to two terms as President of Serbia, on 23 July 1997, Milo≈°eviƒá assumed the presidency of the Federation, though it had been understood he had held the real power for some time before then. Serbian police and military counter-action against the pro-Albanian separatist Kosovo Liberation Army in Serbia's previously autonomous province of Kosovo culminated in escalating armed conflict in 1998 and NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia between March and June 1999, ending in full withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces from the province and deployment of international civil and security forces. Milo≈°eviƒá was indicted on 24 May 1999 for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Kosovo, and he was standing trial, up until his death, at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). He asserted that the trial was illegal, having been established in contravention of the UN Charter. Ironically, Milo≈°eviƒá lost his grip on power by losing in elections he scheduled prematurely (that is, before the end of his mandate) and that he did not even need to win in order to retain power, which was centered in the parliaments that his party and its associates controlled. In the five-man presidential race held on 24 September 2000, Milo≈°eviƒá was defeated in the first round by opposition leader Vojislav Ko≈°tunica, who won slightly more than 50% of the vote. Milo≈°eviƒá initially refused to acquiesce, claiming that no one had won a majority. The Yugoslav constitution called for a runoff between the top two candidates in the event that no candidate won more than 50% of the vote. Official results put Ko≈°tunica ahead of Milo≈°eviƒá but at under 50 percent. The internationally financed CeSID claimed otherwise, though its story changed throughout the two weeks between 24 September and 5 October. This led to mass demonstrations in Belgrade on 5 October, known as the Bulldozer Revolution. Milo≈°eviƒá was forced to accept this when VJ commanders he had expected to support him had indicated that in this instance they would not, and would permit the violent overthrow of the Serbian government. On 6 October, Milo≈°eviƒá met with Ko≈°tunica and publicly accepted defeat. Ko≈°tunica finally took office as Yugoslav president on 7 October following Milo≈°eviƒá's announcement. Milo≈°eviƒá was arrested by Yugoslav authorities on 1 April 2001, following a 36-hour armed standoff between police and Milo≈°eviƒá's bodyguards at his Belgrade villa. Although no official charges were made, Milo≈°eviƒá was suspected of abuse of power and corruption. Following his arrest, the United States pressured the Yugoslav government to extradite Milo≈°eviƒá to the ICTY or lose financial aid from the IMF and World Bank. President Ko≈°tunica opposed extradition of Milo≈°eviƒá, arguing that it would violate the Yugoslav constitution. Prime Minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá called a governmental meeting to issue a decree for extradition. Milo≈°eviƒá's lawyers appealed the extradition process to the Yugoslav constitutional court. The court requested two weeks to deliberate the appeal. Ignoring objections from the president and the constitutional court, ƒêinƒëiƒá ordered the extradition of Milo≈°eviƒá to the ICTY. On 28 June, Milo≈°eviƒá was flown by helicopter from Belgrade to a US airbase in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina and from where he was then flown to The Hague, Netherlands. The extradition caused political turmoil in Yugoslavia. President Ko≈°tunica denounced the extradition as illegal and unconstitutional, while a junior party in the ƒêinƒëiƒá coalition government left in protest. Milo≈°eviƒá's lawyer, Toma Fila said the extradition violated the Yugoslav constitutional ban on extradition. ƒêinƒëiƒá stated there would be negative consequences if the government did not cooperate. Additionally, the government argued that sending Milo≈°eviƒá to the ICTY was not extradition as it is a UN institution and not a foreign country. Following the extradition, a group of donors pledged approximately $1 billion dollars in financial aid to Yugoslavia. Relations with other countries=Russia Historically, Russia and Serbia have had very close relations, sharing a common Slavic ancestry and Orthodox Christian faith. Russia is remembered by most Serbs for its assistance to Serbia during its uprising and war for independence from the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. During Milo≈°eviƒá's rule, Russia pursued policies that generally supported his policies. During the Kosovo conflict in 1999, some observers suggested the possibility of Russia deploying troops in support of Serbia. Russia has provided political asylum to Milo≈°eviƒá's wife and children. China Milo≈°eviƒá first visited China in the early 1980s while head of Beobank. He visited China again in 1997, after an invitation by Chinese president Jiang Zemin. Milo≈°eviƒá was often popularly known in China by the nickname \\"Lao Mi\\" (ËÄÅÁ±≥), a shortened form of the informal Chinese-style nickname \\"Old Milo≈°eviƒá\\" (ËÄÅÁ±≥Ê¥õËàçÁª¥Â•á); among the state-operated media in China, Milo≈°eviƒá was often referred to as \\"Comrade Milo≈°eviƒá\\" (Á±≥Ê¥õËàçÁª¥Â•áÂêåÂøó). Many sources hold that the Chinese government asserted strong backing of Milo≈°eviƒá throughout his presidency until his surrender, and was one of the few countries supportive of him and the Yugoslav government,Milo≈°eviƒá's China dream flops, Chinatown-Belgrade booms Boris Babic 9 September 2006 at a time when most Western countries were strongly critical of the Milo≈°eviƒá government. The New York Times states that People's Republic of China was \\"one of Mr. Milo≈°eviƒá's staunchest supporters\\" during the Kosovo conflict.Eckholm, 8 October 2000 China vocally opposed NATO armed intervention in Kosovo throughout the campaign. Chinese parliamentary leader Li Peng was presented by Milo≈°eviƒá with Yugoslavia's highest medal (the Great Star) in Belgrade in 2000. Marko Milo≈°eviƒá, the son of the deposed Milo≈°eviƒá, was turned away by China on 9 October 2000. Marko Milo≈°eviƒá may have attempted to travel to China because of the ¬£100 million allegedly laundered into Chinese banks by the Milo≈°eviƒá family.„ÄÇ The New York Times observed that Milo≈°eviƒá, and particularly his wife Markoviƒá, had \\"long viewed Beijing and its Communist party\\" as allies and \\"the sort of ideological comrades\\" lacking in Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism in the 1990s. After Milo≈°eviƒá's indictment, China's public statements shifted toward emphasizing Yugoslav-Chinese relations rather than focusing on its support for Milo≈°eviƒá, while after the election of Vojislav Ko≈°tunica as Yugoslav president, Chinese foreign ministry officially stated that \\"China respects the choice of the Yugoslavian people.\\" Trial at The Hague Milo≈°eviƒá was indicted in May 1999, during the Kosovo War, by the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for crimes against humanity in Kosovo. Charges of violating the laws or customs of war, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions in Croatia and Bosnia and genocide in Bosnia were added a year and a half later. Writer Edward S. Herman was critical of the timing and the perceived political nature of these charges, arguing that the leader of a sovereign nation was being indicted while that nation was being attacked by NATO, in order to provide justification for said attacks. He further argued that the flimsy nature of the case was bolstered by adding charges from Bosnian and Croatian War, which ended years prior and Milosevic had strived to end. The charges on which Milo≈°eviƒá was indicted were: genocide; complicity in genocide; deportation; murder; persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds; inhumane acts/forcible transfer; extermination; imprisonment; torture; willful killing; unlawful confinement; willfully causing great suffering; unlawful deportation or transfer; extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; cruel treatment; plunder of public or private property; attacks on civilians; destruction or willful damage done to historic monuments and institutions dedicated to education or religion; unlawful attacks on civilian objects. The ICTY indictment reads that Milo≈°eviƒá was responsible for the forced deportation of 800,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, and the murder of hundreds of Kosovo Albanians and hundreds of non-Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia. Following Milo≈°eviƒá's transfer, the original charges of war crimes in Kosovo were upgraded by adding charges of genocide in Bosnia and war crimes in Croatia. On 30 January 2002, Milo≈°eviƒá accused the war crimes tribunal of an \\"evil and hostile attack\\" against him. The trial began at The Hague on 12 February 2002, with Milo≈°eviƒá defending himself. The prosecution took two years to present its case in the first part of the trial, where they covered the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. Throughout the two-year period, the trial was being closely followed by the public of the involved former Yugoslav republics as it covered various notable events from the war and included several high-profile witnesses. Milo≈°eviƒá died before the trial could be concluded; he was therefore never found guilty of the charges brought against him. Death People paying their respects in front of the Museum of Yugoslav History. On 11 March 2006, Milo≈°eviƒá was found dead in his prison cell in the UN war crimes tribunal's detention centre, located in the Scheveningen section of The Hague, Netherlands. Autopsies soon established that Milo≈°eviƒá had died of a heart attack. He had been suffering from heart problems and high blood pressure. Many suspicions were voiced to the effect that the heart attack had been caused or made possible deliberately ‚Äì by the ICTY, according to sympathizers, or by himself, according to critics. Milo≈°eviƒá's death occurred shortly after the Tribunal denied his request to seek specialised medical treatment at a cardiology clinic in Russia.\\"Report to the President Death of Slobodan Milosevic\\". un.org, May 2006. Pg. 4 para. 3Decision on Assigned Counsel Request for Provisional Release. un.org, 23 February 2006. The reactions to Milo≈°eviƒá's death were mixed: supporters of the ICTY lamented what they saw as Milo≈°eviƒá having remained unpunished, while opponents blamed the Tribunal for what had happened. As he was denied a state funeral, a private funeral for him was held by his friends and family in his hometown of Po≈æarevac, after tens of thousands of his supporters attended a farewell ceremony in Belgrade. The return of Milo≈°eviƒá's body and his widow's return to Serbia were very controversial. Attendees of the funeral included Ramsey Clark and Peter Handke. Legacy The last opinion poll taken in Serbia before Milo≈°eviƒá's death listed him as the third most favourably rated politician in Serbia behind then-Serbian Radical Party chairman Tomislav Nikoliƒá and then- Serbian President Boris Tadiƒá. In February 2007, the International Court of Justice cleared Serbia under Milo≈°eviƒá's rule of direct responsibility for occurrences of crime committed during the Bosnian War. The president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), however, did state that it was \\"'conclusively proved' that the Serbian leadership, and Milo≈°eviƒá in particular, 'were fully aware ... that massacres were likely to occur'\\". In its 2016 verdict regarding Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, the ICTY found that \\"there was no sufficient evidence presented in this case to find that Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá agreed with the common plan [to create territories ethnically cleansed of non- Serbs]\\" citing \\"Milo≈°eviƒá‚Äôs repeated criticism and disapproval of the policies and decisions made by the Accused and the Bosnian Serb leadership\\", though it also noted that \\"Milosevic provided assistance in the form of personnel, provisions and arms to Bosnian Serbs during the conflict\\". In 2010, the Life website included Milo≈°eviƒá in its list of \\"The World's Worst Dictators\\". He remains a controversial figure in Serbia and the Balkans due to the Yugoslav wars and his abuse of power, especially during the elections in both 1997 and 2000.

Jos√© Manuel Fors is a contemporary Cuban artist born in Havana in 1956. His work is principally based on installations and supported by photography. His first artistic forays, during the early eighties, were part of what has been coined \\"The Renaissance of Cuban Art\\". His artworks have been shown in renowned museums and galleries in the United States, Europe and Cuba.  Biography  Jos√© Manuel Fors graduated from the Academy of Art San Alejandro in 1976. He then studied at the Institute of Museology in Havana from 1983 to 1986 and, at the same time, worked as museographer in the National Museum of Baux-Arts. In 1981, Fors participated in one of the most important shows in Cuban artistic renewal, called Volume I. Subsequently, he switched from material abstraction to installations as his primary art form. His first personal exhibition, \\"Accumulations\\" (1983), thus set the stage for some of his most recurrent topics and methodologies as an artist. Fors is often considered a photographer, despite the fact that he infrequently engages in photographic work and, in some cases such as in the early versions of \\"Fallen Leaves\\", it is merely documentary support. Furthermore, the photographs he usually uses in his installations are employed to reveal his interest in memory as topic in his work. In addition, their creations are inspired by the literature of some of the most important Cuban writers, mainly Eliseo Diego and Dulce Maria Loynaz, whose verses title some of Fors' artworks.

He was a disciple of Dov Ber of Mezeritch. Biography Avraham was born in 1741 in Kalyshki, Belarus to Alexander. In his youth, Abraham Kalisker studied Torah with the Vilna Gaon, who later became the leader of the mitnagdim - i.e. those who opposed Hasidic Judaism. Kalisker and his followers took an emotional and mystical approach towards the service of God in contrast to the formalism of traditional religious scholars, who focused on Talmudic study. After the death in 1772 of his teacher, Dov Ber Mezeritch, most of the opposition to hassidism was directed against Kalisker and his disciples. In 1777, at about age 36, he joined the first hassidic aliyah under the leadership of Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk and emigrated to the Holy Land. He died in Tiberias on 9 January 1810.

Etymology and origins The name comes from the Sanskrit words ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§ß ardha meaning \\"half\\", ‡§ö‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞ candra meaning \\"moon\\", and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® ƒÅsana meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". The 19th century Sritattvanidhi uses the name Ardha Chandrasana for a different pose, Vrikshasana. Swami Yogesvarananda used the name in his 1970 First Steps to Higher Yoga for a pose similar to Kapotasana, Pigeon. The modern usage of the name is found in B. K. S. Iyengar's 1966 Light on Yoga.  Practice and benefits  The side bend Indudalasana is known as \\"half moon pose\\" in Bikram Yoga. The pose is entered from Trikonasana (triangle pose), stretching up with the rear leg and out with the front hand so that only the fingertips remain on the ground. The gaze is directed at the upper hand. However, Iyengar describes the pose with the upper hand resting on the hip. The pose helps to strengthen the ankles and improve balance.  Variations  * Parivrtta Ardha Chandrasana (Revolved Half Moon Pose), has the body revolved towards the standing leg. * Baddha Parivrtta Ardha Chandrasana (Bound Revolved Half Moon Pose), has the body revolved towards the standing leg with arms bound around the standing leg.  Other 'half moon' poses  In Sivananda Yoga and its derivative styles such as the Bihar School of Yoga, half moon pose is Anjaneyasana, an asana used in the moon salutation series (Chandra Namaskar). In Bikram Yoga, the name \\"half moon pose\\" is given to a two-legged standing side bend, elsewhere called Indudalasana.

She was born in Thiruvarur, and was brought up at moovalur a village near mayiladhuthurai.hence she was called commonly known as moovalur ramamirtham ammaiyar. She was the author of the 1936 novel Dasigalin Mosavalai alladhu madhi pettra minor (lit. Devadasis' web of deceit or the minor grown wise) which exposed the plight of the devadasis. Originally a supporter of the nationalist Indian National Congress, she became a member of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement after Periyar left the Congress in 1925. In 1930, she supported Muthulakshmi Reddi's failed attempt to abolish the Devadasi system in the Presidency through legislation. She took part in the Anti-Hindi agitations of 1937-40 and in November 1938, was jailed for six weeks for participating in the agitations. The public awareness created by her novel and her continuous campaign to abolish the devadasi system, were instrumental in the passage of the Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act or the Devadasi Abolition Bill, which outlawed the practice in 1947. In 1949, she parted ways with Periyar, when he married Maniammai, a woman much younger than he was. She became a supporter of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a new party started by Periyar's prot√©g√© C. N. Annadurai. She remained a DMK supporter till her death in 1962. In her memory, the Government of Tamil Nadu has instituted the \\"Moovalur Ramamirtham Ammal Ninaivu Marriage Assistance Scheme\\" - a social welfare scheme to provide financial assistance to poor women. She was married to Suyambu Pillai an accomplished musician. She had two sons and a daughter. Unfortunately the first son and the daughter died at very early age. This shock converted her to atheism. She lost faith and belief in god and became a follower of Periyar. Her surviving son Chellappa was settled in mayuram. Married to Rajapadmavathy he had two sons (Selvaraj and Mohan) and two daughters (Vimala and Mallika); settled in Chennai.

Thus, the Mission plays an essential role in supporting the \\"Feed the Future\\" in its work.

The Mission is also engaged with the other Rome-based multilateral organizations: the International Development Law Organization, the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law, and the International Center for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property. Piazza del Popolo, 18 (far left), prior site of the United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome Since the United States is the largest contributor to the UN worldwide, the U.S. has a vital interest in ensuring that UN organizations are efficient and that the activities of the UN complement and enhance the national and foreign policy objectives of the U.S. The Mission works to promote the efficient functioning of the UN food organizations and U.S. interests. As an important donor to these international organizations, the Mission advocates the U.S. government's goal of eliminating global hunger, enhancing nutrition, and the use of agriculture as an engine of economic growth. Formerly the United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome was located in a building on the Piazza del Popolo.

Two people who wish their avatars, or characters, to be married will create an event that resembles a standard wedding. This became very popular with the introduction of Ultima Online, which not only provided rings, outfits and decorations, but sometimes even Gamemasters to officiate. This tradition has carried forward into several other MMORPGs and virtual communities. Some games offer special Bonuses to players who participate in a virtual wedding. In many cases the participants do not know each other outside the virtual community. Some couples may not even know each other's true name, gender, etc. Some do, in fact, extend this union outside the virtual, but most do not. There is no legal recognition for virtual marriages. Some couples have joined in what appear to be legally binding unions through other mediums such as instant messaging or videoconferencing. These ceremonies are presided by the same appropriate officials and witnesses needed for a standard union. Some of these unions occur across state or even national borders. History In 1997 gaming magazine Next Generation reported that 20 virtual weddings had taken place in Meridian 59, an MMORPG which was commercially launched in September of the previous year. The Lord of the Rings Online In April 2007 Salon.com reported that The Lord of the Rings Online had dropped a planned feature for in-game players marriage because of the controversy around the possibility of same-sex and inter-species weddings. One developer stated that the design rule was for weddings to be allowed if examples could be found in the book, as between elves and humans. The online magazine for gaymers GayGamer.net commented that, while Tolkien was a devout Roman Catholic, his stance on gay marriage isn't known as the topic wasn't a public issue at the time. Video game critic Ian Bogost compared it to the case of The Sims 2, a blockbuster video game that did allow same-sex marriage.

He was born in Tophane, (present-day Turkey). He started his early education in his village. In 1893 he came to Istanbul for Madrasa (\\"school\\" in Arabic) education. In 1902 he started Dar√º'l-f√ºnun ilahiyat Faf√ºltesi (Dar√º'l-f√ºnun Divinity School). He finished his faculty in 1903 and started working as Ders-i Amm (Ulema, a person who teaches the Madrasa students) in the Fatih Mosque. He was later arrested and taken to jail several times, but freed. He was the founding member of Cemiyet-i M√ºderrisinTarƒ±k Zafer Tunaya: T√ºrkiye ºde siyasal partiler Band 2, H√ºrriyet Vakfƒ± Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 1986, p. 382 together with Mustafa Sabri, an Islamic group that supported the government under Damat Ferid and advocated the British Mandate and the Greek invasion of Turkey. They were fiercely against the national government in Ankara which later led the Turks to the Turkish War of Independence.Binnaz Toprak: Islam and Political Development in Turkey, BRILL, 1981, p. 69 Before the westernization movement in Turkey, he wrote a book titled Frenk Mukallitliƒüi ve ≈ûapka (literally, Westernization and the (European) Hat) in 1924. In it, he advocated Sharia law and opposed what he called western influences like \\"Alcohol, Prostitution, Theater, Dance\\" and the \\"western hat\\". From his viewpoint, the western hat was a symbol of the infidels, and wearing a hat would make Muslims to lose their Islamic identity. After the passing of \\"The Hat Act\\", a law that passed on 25 November 1925 and ordered that no other headwear except the western hat was allowed (therefore banning the wearing the fez), violent rebellion broke out in some provinces, which the government suppressed. He was arrested and sent to Ankara on 26 December 1925 where he stood trial on 26 January 1926. The attorney general demanded three years of imprisonment, but the court postponed the trial to the next day. The next day, the Hodja declared that he no longer desired to defend himself. He was sentenced to death and hanged on 4 February 1926. His views on Western civilization In his book Medeniyet-i ≈ûer'iyye ve Terakkiyat-ƒ± Diniyye (The Civilization of the Sharia and Religious Progress), he presents his views on what is profitable and what is not in Western civilization: > Materially and spiritually, the Western civilization has two aspects, one of > which is useful and one of which is harmful to humanity. The hadiths of our > Prophet clearly allow and encourage the adoption of useful innovations of > Western civilization by Muslims: ‚ÄúIf one person invents something beautiful > and this invention becomes useful to the people, this inventor would be > blessed by God until the Day of Judgment,\\" and, ‚ÄúYou (people) know better > the worldly matters.‚Äú These hadiths clearly show that the Islamic religion > does not forbid good and utilitarian inventions that will benefit the Muslim > community and ensure its progress. The use of all tools and skills ‚Äì from > the sewing needle to reailroads, artillery, iron-clad warships and > dreadnoughts, airplanes, and instruments of communication, land and sea > trade, various arts and crafts, factories, agricultural tools and any other > useful invention ‚Äì is condoned and recommended in Islam. To prepare the > ground for these inventions, Islam in fact orders the education of every > individual, male and female. As understood from the works of European > sociologist Gustave Le Bon, industry, like other aspects of civilization, > was first instituted six or seven thousand years ago in Asia by the > Assyrians, later moving to Egypt. The development of early Greek art is due > to the influence of the civilizations of the Tigris and the Nile. Thanks to > this favorable attitude towards science and scholarship, Muslims adopted the > scientific discoveries of the earlier civilizations of Egypt and Greece, and > later surpassed these civilizations by excelling in the arts and sciences. > As a consequence of crusades to Muslim countries, [European] Crusaders > brought Islamic arts to Europe. This prepared th ground for the rise and > blossoming of European art. Europeans marveled at the radiant splendor of > the Andalusian civilization in Iberia [Spain and Portugal]. In these ages > [early Middle Ages], western Europeans had languished in a miserable > condition, living in savagery, ignorance, and darkness. The origins of > Western civilization are, therefore, found in Eastern civilization. Despite > this, Islam inaugurated a new era for the development of the useful aspects > of progress and created a wonderful civilization. One could wonder why > today's Muslims are deprived of these high values. We believe that the most > obvious answer is because they neglected one of the important requirements > of the Muslim religion: to work in order to earn. Muslims could benefit from > their religion only by living their life, conducting their business and > acting according to the high principles of Islam and applying them > faithfully. If Muslims keep these principles only in books and other > documents and do not actually apply them to their daily life, they cannot > benefit from them. The Prophet Muhammad said:‚Äúsome knowledge is like > ignorance.‚Äú Knowledge that is not put into practice is no different from the > lack of knowledge. The learned person who does not use this knowledge cannot > distance himself from the common people. It is clear that the Islamic > religion allows and encourages the good and beneficial aspects of Western > civilization, and forbid the decadent, immoral, vice-prone and ugly side of > it (such as unbelief [atheism], oppression, prostitution, gambling, drinking > alcohol, or dancing). Islam prohibits the immoral aspects of Western > civilization, such as bars, theatres, brothels and gambling dens. Therefore, > it is strictly forbidden in Islam to imitate the Western lifestyle and live > like non-Muslims.

Jennings through his teaching and pedagogic writings was a major influence on the Dissenting educational tradition. Life Jennings‚Äôs father, John Jennings (1634‚Äì1701), a native of Oswestry, Shropshire, was educated at Christ Church, Oxford and was ejected from the rectory of Hartley Wespall, Hampshire after the Act of Uniformity 1662. The elder John Jennings was afterwards a private chaplain at Langton, near Kibworth, and founder of the independent congregation at Kibworth, where he purchased a small estate. A younger son, David Jennings, became known as tutor of the Coward Trust academy in Wellclose Square. Jennings was educated at Timothy Jollie's academy at Attercliffe, and succeeded his father as independent minister at Kibworth, where from 1715 he conducted a nonconformist academy. His students included Philip Doddridge, who carried on the academy tradition in various locations; others were Sir John Cope and John Mason, the writer on Self-Knowledge. In July 1722 Jennings became minister of the Presbyterian congregation at Hinckley, and moved his academy to that town, where a new meeting-house was immediately built for him. Next year he fell a victim to smallpox, and died at Hinckley on 8 July 1723. Pedagogy The four years' course of study was documented by Doddridge,Correspondence, 1829, ii. 462 sq. who comments on his tutor's thoroughness of method and liberality of spirit. Doddridge took Jennings's theological lectures as the basis of his own. Alexander Gordon, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, describes John Jennings as more able and original than his brother David.

It is best known for its pliers‚Äîthe company manufactures more than 140 types of pliers‚Äîparticularly its eponymous style of tongue-and-groove, slip-joint pliers. Its pliers have distinctive sky-blue handle grips; the company has been using the same trademarked shade of blue since 1956. It also produces cutting pliers, linemen's pliers, long nose pliers, adjustable wrenches, screwdrivers, nutdrivers and special-purpose pliers, as well as multi-function tools for the fire service and other first responders. According to the company, , all of its pliers were manufactured at one of its two facilities in Meadville, Pennsylvania. Tongue-and-groove pliers with classic sky-blue handle grips. History The company was founded in 1886 when George B. DeArment, a blacksmith from Evansburg, Pennsylvania (present day Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania), began hand-forging farrier's tools and selling them from town to town out of the back of a wagon. He would spend the Winter forging tools, load up his wagon in the Spring when roads became passable, and set out selling his tools. When he ran out of tools, he would sell the wagon and buy a train ticket home to Evansburg. The business eventually became known as the Champion Bolt and Clipper Company. In 1904, the company moved to a facility in Meadville, Pennsylvania, and added nippers, pinchers and open-end wrenches to its product line. George B. DeArment‚Äôs two sons, Almon W. and J. Howard DeArment, became partners in the company in 1911 and expanded the product line again to include hammers. In 1923, the company moved again to a facility at its current location in Meadville. Four years later, the name of the company was changed to the Champion‚ÄìDeArment Tool Company. In 1933, Chief Engineer Howard Manning developed the tongue-and-groove, slip-joint pliers for which the company is known. In 1934, a patent for this design was granted, and in 1949, a trademark for the name \\"Channellock\\" was granted, with a first-use date of May 1, 1932. From this point to the 1960s, the company began to focus more on the fast-growing pliers side of its business, developing improvements to the original design. The word \\"Channellock\\" eventually became so synonymous with their product that the company changed its name to Channellock, Inc. in 1963 to capitalize on the popularity of its product. Today Channellock is managed by the fourth and fifth generations of the DeArment family with William S. DeArment serving as CEO & Chairman of the Board, Jon S. DeArment serving as President & COO, and Ryan DeArment serving as Vice President of Sales and Marketing. The company is based out of two facilities, equalling a total of , in Meadville. , the company claimed to be the largest employer in Crawford County, Pennsylvania, with over 500 employees. The company has more than 4,000 U.S. wholesale and retail customers and ships to customers in 45 countries.
