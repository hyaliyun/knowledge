Like queer studies, Filipino American LGBT Studies spans multiple disciplines, such as history, psychology, sociology, and political science. Although it centers around Americans of Filipino descent, the field also expands to studies of Filipino culture, history, and politics in relation to Filipino Americans who are LGBT. It also highlights Filipino American LGBT immigration and colonialist history, community and culture, and scholars. Due to a lack of literature, research primarily focuses on gay Filipino men and, to a lesser extent, lesbian Filipino women. As such, bisexual, and transgender Filipino Americans are not well-studied. Immigration Filipino immigration to the United States is influenced by the Philippine's past history of colonization by the United States, which continues to affect Filipino American immigrants today. U.S. colonial period Over the first decade of the period the Philippines was a United States colony, no regulations were put in place regarding cross- dressing with only \\"oblique\\" regulations regarding same-sex acts. In 1870 the Spanish Penal Code, which had been used as a guideline for criminal law by the Spanish colonialists, began to be used by the United States in the Philippines and was used until the 1930s. This, too, did not formally regulate sodomy, though it was informally policed despite a lack of legislation. In its place, laws against vagrancy were introduced and linked certain public spaces, such as gambling houses or cockpits, with immorality. These laws resulted in greater amounts of prosecutions of United States veterans in the Philippines than Philippine natives. Regulation of same-sex acts (e.g. sodomy) occurred only in a \\"limited and oblique fashion\\" as opposed to the manner in which it was managed in the United States mainland. First-generation immigrants First-generation Filipino LGBT immigrants, even those who immigrated at an early age, may face certain challenges as a result of their immigrant status, such as contention with the concept of coming out or of political activism. Success and \\"making it\\" in America is considered to be more important than the idea of coming out. Second-generation immigrants Second-generation Filipino LGBT immigrants may clash with their first-generation Filipino parents, resulting in adverse effects on their life in such dimensions as educational achievement. In contrast to first-generation Filipino LGBT immigrants, second-generation immigrants may have greater desire to come out. Community and culture=Notable Members The Filipino American LGBT community has several notable members, such as (in alphabetical order): * Richard Adams * Manila Luzon * Kevin Nadal * Geena Rocero * Fritzie Rodriguez * Patty Tiu * Jose Antonio Vargas Activism Although there are prominent Filipino American LGBT activists, such as Richard Adams, some Filipino Americans ‚Äî particularly first-generation immigrants ‚Äî report a disavowing of activism or certain LGBT community events, such as gay pride parades, which are described as baklang karnabal (or carnival bakla). Cultural attitudes encouraging rapid assimilation into American society contribute to expectations contrary to activism. However, groups like the Union of Democratic Filipinos (Katipunan ng mga Demokratikong Pilipino, or the KDP) formed in 1972, have existed nonetheless. Coming out Coming out may be seen as \\"desirable\\" among second-generation immigrants, but for first- generation immigrants it poses potential legal trouble, particularly for undocumented immigrants. Coming out is not a cultural tenet in the Filipino American LGBT community as it is in the \\"mainstream\\" gay community and verbal declaration of one's identity is considered to be less important than pakiramdaman, or \\"feeling out\\" one's identity. Organizations Several LGBT organizations exist, some of which serve solely Filipino Americans and some of which serve Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders as a whole: * Gay Asian Pacific Support Network * Barangay * Filipino American Foundation of New Mexico * National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance * API Equality (with branches in Northern California and Los Angeles) Bakla and Tomboys Bakla is a word meaning \\"homosexual\\" in Tagalog. It is embodied by the stereotype of the parlorista, a cross-dresser who works in a beauty salon and typically denotes effeminate or cross-dressing men. Like the word faggot in the United States, it is a controversial term that may be considered offensive. In Filipino LGBT culture, tomboy does not refer only to a masculine girl, but can also take on the specific connotation of \\"lesbian.\\" Beauty pageants and drag Gay beauty pageants are found across the Filipino diaspora and are important sources of revenue for event organizers; entertainment for attendees; and opportunities to present one's strengths for pageant contestants. An example of a famous Filipino American drag queen is Manila Luzon, former contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race, a popular internationally- airing drag queen competition television show. Other Filipino queens have competed on the show, as well. Racism Gay and lesbian Asian Americans are often targeted by racism or stigmatization in the LGBT community. Gay Latino Americans similarly face racial stigmatization. Filipino Americans racially or ethnically are sometimes considered to fall into either or both categories, and they experience higher rates of racial discrimination than East Asian Americans with types of racial discrimination experienced comparable to Black or Latino Americans. Filipino American LGBT people also report such issues as managing identifying as Asian American versus Filipino American, dealing with stereotypes due to their race and racial gender roles, and difficulties in having to \\"shift\\" identities across reference groups (such as ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender) that they may identify with. In 2015, same-sex marriage was Same-sex marriage in the United States in the United States. Although the upheaval of the Defense of Marriage Act allowed for gay and lesbian couples to legally marry, the benefits of same-sex marriage often do not extend to Filipino/a immigrants who may be undocumented, and mainly benefit documented, middle-class White Americans. Religion The vast majority of the Philippines identifies as Roman Catholic, which considers homosexuality immoral. As a result of the influence of Catholicism, Filipino American LGBT youth report \\"opposition to homosexuality\\" and \\"guilt and shame\\" of one's own homosexuality. Some Filipino American LGBT immigrants modify or adapt traditional Catholicism as it is practiced in the Philippines to be congruent with their new American lifestyle, with some shifting to a more agnostic or atheistic view (perhaps a manifestation of their separation from their families). Notable Scholars and Works Although the field of Filipino American LGBT studies is relatively new, there are a couple of notable scholars in the field of that include (in alphabetical order): Martin F. Manalansan IV Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. His research includes Filipino immigration and queer people of color. He is the author of Global Divas and has received numerous awards, such as the Association for Asian American Studies Award for excellence in mentoring. Kevin Nadal Scholar, activist, and professor. Nadal is considered to be a leading expert in the field of Filipino American mental health and his research encompasses \\"multicultural issues in psychology,\\" including LGBT people of color. He founded the LGBTQ Scholars of Color network in 2015, and his areas of expertise include Filipino American identity and American LGBT issues. His publications include works like Filipino American Psychology: A Handbook of Theory, Research, and Clinical Practice and That's So Gay!: Microaggressions and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community. Anthony Ocampo Sociologist and professor at California State Polytechnic University. He focuses on issues such as immigration, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender within Filipino, Latin, and Asian Americans in Los Angeles, California. He is the author of The Latinos of Asia: How Filipino Americans Break the Rules of Race, and he has contributed to other works on race and ethnicity.

Early career Born in Ayrshire, Sam Johnson was one of at least seven children born to the actor Samuel Johnson and Isabella (n√©e Elliott). Most of his siblings were actors, while one brother was a scene painter. He first appeared on stage at the Maryport Theatre in Cumberland in 1844 as Bartolo in The Wife.John M Clarke, London's Necropolis: A Guide to Brookwood Cemetery, Sutton Publishing (2004) p213 In 1845 he and his two sisters went to Belfast and joined Cunningham's company at the Theatre Royal. In 1846 he and his sister, the actress Barbara Johnson, were appearing in Belfast. In December 1846 Barbara Johnson married the actor John W. Anson. The three, together with two others from the Belfast company, moved to Scotland where they formed a new company, of which John Anson was manager. From early 1847 in the Perth area, they appeared in towns with a repertory of plays so that the audience of each town could see several plays in a week. Barbara Anson took the lead female roles, and John Anson and Samuel Johnson shared the low comedy parts. Late in 1847 the trio played in the Dundee area. Johnson first worked with Henry Irving in 1856. From 1853 to 1855 he was in partnership with John Coleman, and the two rented theatres in Stockport, Oldham (where over 2,000 applicants responded to their advert for actors), Cambridge and Sheffield. On leaving the partnership Johnson appeared at the Lyceum Theatre in Sunderland and the Theatre Royal in Newcastle. The New Royal Lyceum Theatre re-opened in Sunderland in 1856 with a production of Bulwer Lytton's play Richelieu, in which Johnson played the Governor and the 18-year-old Henry Irving played Gaston, Duke of Orleans.'Legendary actor who took his first steps to stardom in Sunderland' ‚Äì Sunderland Echo ‚Äì 29 July 2016 When the inexperienced Irving got stage fright and was hissed off the stage, Johnson was among those who supported Irving with practical advice.Austin Brereton, The Life of Henry Irving, Longmans, Green and Co., (1908) Later in life Irving gave them all regular work when he formed his own company at the Lyceum Theatre. London and Dublin Johnson made his London stage d√©but at a Savage Club performance at the Lyceum Theatre as Cassim Baba in The Forty Thieves. He then joined the company at Astley's Amphitheatre, appearing in plays and farces until early 1860. From 1860 to late 1862 Johnson was in Edinburgh where he played low comedy roles and Scottish characters, and from April to December 1862 he was actor-manager of the new Theatre Royal at St Helens. During 1863 he appeared at the St James's Theatre in The Carte de Visite and played Spilliken in H.J. Byron's Goldenhair the Good and Leontes in William Brough's burlesque Perdita, the title role being played by Marie Wilton. From 1864 to 1873 Johnson was a member of the Company of the Theatre Royal in Dublin. Here, among other roles, he played the Gravedigger in Hamlet (1864), and M'Nally in the first performance of Dion Boucicault's Arrah-na- Pogue (1864), with Boucicault, John Brougham and Samuel Anderson Emery in the cast. Lyceum Theatre The Lyceum Theatre in London. Johnson acted here from 1878 to 1899. From 1874 to 1878 Johnson was actor and stage manager with Mr. Warden's Company in Belfast, touring with the company to Edinburgh and Glasgow in a series of old comedies. With his daughter Isa Johnson he appeared in a number of Easter pantomimes. In August 1878 he was at the Lyceum Theatre in London as Police Sergeant Tollit in Mary Warner. Immediately after this play finished, the Lyceum was taken over by Henry Irving who asked Johnson to join his new company at the theatre. Johnson stayed with Irving's Lyceum Theatre Company until 1899, playing in twenty-three productions, and went to America on five of the Lyceum tours. While many of his roles with the company were small, John Martin-Harvey described him as the acknowledged Shakespearean clown of his day, and his Lancelot Gobbo in The Merchant of Venice, Gail Marshall, Shakespeare in the Nineteenth Century ‚Äì Cambridge University Press ‚Äì Google Books p388 Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing (1882 and 1893)Productions of Much Ado About Nothing ‚Äì Shakespeare and the Players websiteJohnson as Dogberry ‚Äì Henry Irving Correspondence websiteJ.

Last years Johnson's last performance was at the Theatre Royal Haymarket weeks before his death. In February 1899 Johnson played Mr. Stryver in The Only Way, again at the Lyceum Theatre but now under John Martin-Harvey as manager. Not feeling in the best of health, Johnson decided not to join the sixth Lyceum tour to America, appearing instead in his last role as Meester van Speenen in The Black Tulip with Cyril Maude and Winifred Emery at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in a production that ran for 77 performances and which closed on 6 January 1900. A heavy drinker, Johnson died of cirrhosis of the liver on 15 February 1900 at 29, Weltje Road in Hammersmith in London. Personal life He married Mary Ann Hornby on 10 July 1858 at Marske-by-the-Sea. The couple had a son, Samuel Forster Johnson (1859‚Äì1860), and a daughter, the actress Isabella 'Isa' Elizabeth Johnson (1861‚Äì1941). A Freemason, he was a Past Master of Asaph Lodge. Johnson is buried in Brookwood Cemetery with his wife, son and daughter and in the same plot as his sister and her husband, John W. Anson. The funeral was attended by his brother John Johnson and by actors and others from Asaph Lodge, Logic Club, Genesius Club, the Actors' Association, the Lyceum Benevolent Fund and the Actors' Benevolent Fund. Henry Irving and other members of the Lyceum Theatre Company were still on tour in America and were therefore not able to attend.

Training 76th AA Brigade did not form part of Anti- Aircraft Command but came directly under General Headquarters, Home Forces. Its units were under training for service overseas, though in February 1943, 233 Battery of 75th LAA Rgt was lent to AA Command's 72nd AA Bde on the Isle of Wight which required more LAA guns to deal with Luftwaffe 'hit and run' attacks. After attending practice camps in various part of the UK, all four regiments left for service in the Mediterranean theatre.Routledge, pp. 261‚Äì3, Table XLII, p. 267.

Apart from 120th LAA Rgt at Southampton, the whole brigade concentrated at Southend-on-Sea. D-Day Crusader AA tank mounting 40 mm Bofors gun. In Second Army's plan for Overlord, 76th AA Bde was to support XXX Corps in its landing on Gold Beach. Light AA (LAA) defence was emphasised at the start of the operation, since low-level attack by Luftwaffe aircraft was considered the most likely threat. Assault units were to be landed with minimum scales of equipment, to be brought up to strength by parties landing later. As well as the towed Bofors 40 mm guns of the standard LAA regiments, a battery of 93rd LAA Regiment was attached to the brigade for this phase, equipped with triple 20 mm Polsten guns, half of them self-propelled (SP), mounted on Crusader tank chassis.Routledge, pp. 305‚Äì12.76 AA Bde Operation Order No 1, 10 May 1944, TNA file WO 171/1084.80 AA Bde Operation Order No 1, 20 May 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085.

Also attached from 80th AA Bde to land shortly on Gold Beach were 373 Bty and one Trp of 372 Bty of 114th LAA Rgt, with 24 SP Bofors guns mounted on Crusader tank chassis, Barrage balloon parties, and detachments from 112 Company Pioneer Corps equipped with smoke generators. By nightfall on D-Day, 76th AA Bde planned to have put ashore: * 12 x 3.7-inch HAA guns * 30 x 40mm Bofors * 12 x 20mm * 6 x S/L In practice, this proved too ambitious. Nevertheless, 394/120th and 320/93rd LAA Btys landed their 40mm and 20mm guns in the first 90 minutes without too much difficulty, although a Bofors gun was lost when its LCT hit a mine. RHQ of 113rd HAA Rgt landed on the next tide and set up the tactical HQ, but none of its own guns appeared. While awaiting their guns, the remainder of 120th LAA Rgt acted as infantry, clearing enemy positions. Brigadier Benson and his staff landed from two LSTs at Le Hamel near Asnelles at 18.00 and established their Tactical HQ at Buholt at 22.30. By midnight the commanding officers of 113th HAA and 120th LAA Rgts had landed, while 394/120th and 320/93rd LAA Btys had landed 8 x Bofors and 6 x 20mm guns in King Sector and 9 x Bofors and 2 x 20mm in Jig Sector. A reconnaissance party from 112 Pioneer Company had arrived, but no HAA guns, searchlights or balloons had been landed. Three enemy aircraft were destroyed by the LAA guns during the night, two at dusk and one at dawn.

Once the AA defences of Gold Beach were in place, 76th AA Bde's main task became the protection of the artificial Mulberry harbour being assembled nearby at Arromanches-les-Bains. The defences planned for Mulberry B were: * HQ AA ship HMS Despatch ‚Äì 16 x 40mm (127th LAA Rgt) * 34 Phoenix caissons ‚Äì 34 x 40mm (127th LAA Rgt) * 3 Corncob blockships ‚Äì 4 x 40mm (127th LAA Rgt) * 15 AA barges ‚Äì 30 x 40mm (139th LAA Rgt) * Mulberry piers ‚Äì 36 x 20mm (320/93rd LAA Bty) (Several of these guns and crews had to be evacuated onto land after the storm of 19/20 June.) 3.7 inch HAA gun preserved at Imperial War Museum, Duxford. Used in HAA and medium roles in Normandy. In addition, one battery of 113th HAA Rgt was made available to XXX Corps' medium artillery to fire on ground targets. By D+15, 99th and 146th HAA Rgts had arrived to strengthen the AA defences of Mulberry B and the important oil installations at Port-en-Bessin and to provide further ground fire. At Port-en-Bessin, 146th HAA and 139th LAA Rgts were in action for 33 consecutive nights against high- and low-level bombing, employing visual, radar and barrage methods. The HAA guns here fired 5563 rounds, scoring 11 'kills'. A subsidiary task for 112th and 146th HAA Rgts was to establish radar stations on the cliffs above Arromanches and Port-en-Bessin to track Luftwaffe minelaying aircraft and the fall of the Parachute mines so that they could be cleared by the Royal Navy. Elsewhere across 76th AA Bde's area, Luftwaffe attacks were small and scattered, but the AA sites themselves were often the targets. Otherwise, firing by the brigade's units was generally in the medium artillery role. Searchlights began to be used to provide 'artificial moonlight' for tanks moving at night.Routledge, p. 313. Bofors gun and crew, summer 1944 Between 15 and 25 June, 76th AA Bde attained its full strength in Normandy:Routledge, Table XLIX, p. 319. * 76th Bde HQ at Buhot * 99th HAA Rgt (302, 303, 318 HAA Btys) * 112th HAA Rgt (352, 353, 380 HAA Btys) * 113th HAA Rgt (362, 366, 391 HAA Btys) * 146th HAA Rgt (176, 414, 465 HAA Btys) * 120th LAA Rgt (393, 394, 395 LAA Btys) * 125th LAA Rgt (417, 418, 419 LAA Btys) * 127th LAA Rgt (416, 439, 440 LAA Btys) * 62/20th LAA Bty * 320/93rd LAA Bty (returned to 80th AA Bde late July) * 373/114th LAA Bty (returned to 80th AA Bde mid August) * 356th Ind S/L Bty * 152 & 160 AAORs * 806, 810 Smoke Coys & A Group 112 Coy, Pioneer Corps * 980, 991 Beach Balloon & 104 Port Balloon units (323 Coy RASC did not land until late July) Breakout After 21st Army Group finally broke out of its beachhead in August 1944, 76th AA Bde was relieved of its responsibilities on the coast by 105th AA Bde on 1 September and was made available to support the advance. 99th HAA and 109th LAA Rgts were sent to defend Cherbourg and were relieved by 121st HAA Rgt from the UK. 76th AA Brigade was earmarked for the defence of Rouen, but the early capture of Dieppe by First Canadian Army led to the brigade being deployed there, at Amiens, and along the River Somme.Routledge, pp. 315‚Äì23; Table LI, p. 328. By 11 September the armies were advancing so rapidly that 76th AA Bde gave up Dieppe and concentrated at Amiens under orders to prepare for the AA defence of the vital port of Antwerp once that was in Allied hands. In the interim the brigade took over AA and coast defence duties at Boulogne on 23 September. Next day, 362/113th HAA Bty came under fire from German 88 mm guns at Cap Gris Nez, and for two days the battery replied until the target was observed to be damaged. Antwerp The headlong advance ended with the failure of Operation Market Garden at Arnhem, and emphasis shifted to bringing the port of Antwerp into use as a supply base. The planners envisaged a large Gun Defence Area (GDA) to deal not only with conventional air raids but also the threat of V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers').Routledge, pp. 322, 333. 76th AA Brigade's move to Antwerp finally occurred in mid-October, the brigade being relieved by 80th AA Bde at Boulogne, while 125th LAA Rgt and 1617th Platoon RASC temporarily left to join 107th AA Bde in the Siege of Dunkirk. 76th AA Brigade's intended deployment area was still in enemy hands, so 112th and 113th HAA Rgts operated in the ground role supporting II Canadian Corps in clearing the south side of the Scheldt Estuary (the Battle of the Scheldt), with the Canadian gun lines protected by 120th LAA Rgt and 557th S/L Bty. When the brigade had overcome flooding and minefields to take up its positions on the islands of Walcheren and South Beveland, its guns engaged German units escaping by boat from Walcheren, and supported 4th Commando Brigade's continuing operations on North Beveland.Routledge, Table LII, p. 331; p. 334. Once secure, the GDA covering the whole area of Antwerp and the estuary was established, with 76th AA Bde responsible for the Scheldt North zone. HAA positions were established at intervals of 4‚Äì5000 yards along the waterway, interspersed with irregularly sited LAA positions. 2nd S/L Rgt arrived direct from England with the primary task of cooperating with the LAA guns against mine-laying in the channel. The brigade also formed a local warning radar troop from its own resources. By December, the brigade had the following units under command:Routledge, p. 335; Map 30. * 98th HAA Rgt (joined 16/17 November) * 112th HAA Rgt * 113th HAA Rgt * 120th LAA Rgt * 124th (Highland) LAA Rgt (joined 16/17 November) * 125th LAA Rgt * 2nd S/L Rgt (joined 17 November) * 152 AAOR * No 1 Local Warning (Radar) Trp (formed 27 November) * 323 Artillery Coy RASC (1506, 1540, 1617, 1618, 1651 & 1652 Artillery Platoons) On 19 December, 98th HAA Rgt was transferred to the US 50th AA Artillery Brigade to assist in the 'Diver' defence belt, and the rest of the North Scheldt guns had to be redeployed to fill the gap. The only enemy aircraft seen in this period were on reconnaissance missions, usually flying very high, but on 8 December the brigade scored its first 'kill' since arriving in the area, when A Trp of 362/113rd HAA Bty destroyed a Junkers Ju 188 picked up on radar and then illuminated by searchlight. When the German Army launched its Ardennes offensive (the Battle of the Bulge) aimed at breaking through to Antwerp, 76th AA Bde was ordered to take precautions against possible attacks by German airborne troops, as well as dealing with increased air activity at night. On 1 January 1945, the Luftwaffe launched Operation Bodenplatte: daylight attacks against Allied airfields in support of the Ardennes offensive. Between 09.20 and 09.54 some 50‚Äì60 enemy aircraft, mainly Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190, came over 76th AA Bde's area. Its war diary records: 'This was the best day since our formation', with 15 aircraft claimed as 'certainly destroyed' and others probably crashed in enemy territory.76 AA Bde War Diary, January‚ÄìJuly 1945, TNA file WO 171/4889.Routledge, pp. 346‚Äì7. Biber midget submarine preserved at Deutsches Technik Museum Berlin. After that, enemy air activity was sparse, but on 9 January, four Bofors of 411/124th LAA Bty hit and sank a German Biber midget submarine operating off South Beveland. Two others were destroyed later, one by Bofors, one by 3.7-inch guns of 113th HAA Rgt, together with a manned torpedo. In mid-February, 76th AA Bde HQ took over local administration of the Scheldt islands from 4th Commando Bde. Apart from coastal defence and occasional ground fire tasks, particularly against enemy positions on Schouwen, much of the early part of 1945 was taken up with unit training to use the new SCR-584 radar and No 10 Predictors (the all-electric Bell Labs AAA Computer) for HAA guns, and new No 2 Mark VIII searchlight control (SLC) radar. The brigade also cooperated with the Royal Navy, using GL Mk III gunlaying radar to direct landing craft making a raid on Schouwen on the night of 11/12 March. In March and April, the brigade lent a platoon of its AEC Matador HAA gun tractors to 21st Army Group to assist in transporting engineering stores for the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder). This included towing Bren carriers full of stores, and heavy sledges normally moved by Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers.Routledge, p. 348. As the war in Europe drew to its close, AA commitments in rear areas were reduced and units closed up to the Scheldt, where they were either sent forward into Germany (as AA or occupation troops) or prepared for disbandment. 113th and 146th HAA Regiments, 114th and 139th LAA Regts were all disbanded in April 1945, 98th HAA Rgt was converted into garrison troops, and 103rd HAA Rgt was converted into a driver training regiment. 76th AA Bde's order of battle in the final weeks of the war was as follows:Routledge, p. 348; Table LVII, p. 366. * 86th (Honourable Artillery Company) HAA Rgt * 99th HAA Rgt * 120th LAA Rgt * 411/124th LAA Bty * 125th LAA Rgt * 1st S/L Rgt (less one bty) On 9 April 1945 Brig Benson left to become Commander RA (CRA) for 52nd (Lowland) Division and was replaced by Brig E.J.C. Chaytor, and later by Brig J.C. Friedberger, former CRA of 53rd (Welsh) Division. The brigade was ordered to cease fire on 3 May 1945 when a local truce came into effect to allow supplies to be sent to civilians in enemy-occupied Holland (Operation Manna). This was followed on 4 May by the German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath and the end of the war in Europe (VE Day). Occupation duties After VE Day, the brigade remained temporarily on its AA tasks. Its units then returned to the mainland from the Scheldt islands and concentrated north of Antwerp before moving into Germany in June to garrison the Dortmund‚ÄìBochum area under I Corps.Routledge, p. 363. The units under command during this period were: * 112th HAA Rgt * 120th LAA Rgt * 124th LAA Rgt * 125th LAA Rgt * 1st S/L Rgt * 51st (Midland) Medium Rgt By October the brigade had established its HQ at Burgsteinfurt Schloss under the command of 52nd (L) Division. As well as guarding vital points, it was responsible for camps containing 6000 disarmed former Wehrmacht soldiers and 9000 displaced persons (DPs).76 AA Bde War Diary, August‚ÄìDecember 1945, TNA file WO 171/4890. As the year progressed, units were progressively disbanded as the troops were demobilised. 112th HAA Regiment went in October, and 120th LAA Rgt in January 1946. 26th LAA Rgt joined briefly from the Italian theatre, but this Territorial Army (TA) unit was placed in suspended animation in February together with 125th LAA. 76 AA Bde War Diary, 1946, TNA file WO 171/8878.Farndale, Annex M.Litchfield, pp. 40‚Äì41. Brigade HQ (and 51st Medium Rgt) completed their disbandment in the first two weeks of April 1946. Its remaining unit, 124th LAA Rgt, stayed on as part of British Army of the Rhine, but was placed in suspended animation later in the year.Litchfield, p. 274. Postwar In 1947, a new 76 AA Brigade was formed in the TA. However, this was unconnected with the wartime formation of the same number; instead it was formed by reconstituting the TA's former 50 Light AA Bde at Leicester. It was disbanded in November 1950.Routledge, p. 441.AA Bdes 67‚Äì106 at British Army 1945 on.Watson, TA 1947. Litchfield, Appendix 5.

The company was founded in 1980 and is located in Helena, Alabama. It is owned by TUI Group.  Company overview  International Expeditions provides small-group adventure experiences in various exotic countries. These include land-based trips to places like Ecuador, Kenya, Tanzania, and Patagonia, as well as cruise excursions in notable wildlife and natural areas such as the Peruvian Amazon and Galapagos Islands. While it focuses primarily on land-based activities, IE charters a variety of riverboats and yachts for cruise programs in Patagonia, India, Cuba, the Amazon, and Galapagos. IE is a subsidiary of TUI Group, a multinational travel and tourism company headquartered in Hannover, Germany. It is a part of the Adventure Specialist Group within TUI's Specialist Group, which also includes AmeriCan Adventures, Exodus, Grand American Adventures, Headwater, Quark Expeditions, Sawadee, TrekAmerica, World Challenge, and Zegrahm Expeditions. IE is managed by Travelopia,https://www.travelopia.com/#brands a collection of specialist travel brands.  Leadership  International Expeditions was co- founded by Dr. Richard Ryel and Steve Cox. Ryel also served as the Chairman of the Board of the International Ecotourism Society. Van Perry was appointed the president of International Expeditions in November 2011. He is also the president of Zegrahm Expeditions, an adventure travel company located in Seattle, Washington.  Controversy  In April 2016, a cabin on International Expeditions' \\"Estrella Amazonica,\\" now known as \\"Amazon Star,\\" caught fire, killing two American passengers: Drs. Larry and Christy Hammer. According to investigators, the fire was caused by a power strip that was supplied by the boat and lacked surge protection and safety and flammability ratings. The Hammers' room lacked an in-room fire alarm. Surveillance video footage shows that it took the Estrella Amazonica's crew more than 22 minutes to extract Dr. Larry Hammer from the room after the fire was located; and another six minutes to extract Dr. Christy Hammer. In the days following the fire, International Expeditions claimed that the Chief of Fire Department‚ÄìLoreto Region, a Chief of Fire Prevention and Investigation Unit, a Chief of Instruction and Investigation, the commanding Deputy District Attorney, the Tourism Police Force, and Port Authorities cleared the vessel safe to carry guests. These claims have not been verified. Perry and International Expeditions are criticized for declaring the boat \\"safe to travel,\\" and for the ship to resume sailing within two days of the tragedy given that Perry and International Expeditions did not know at that time what caused the fire, why no alarm sounded anywhere on the boat, and why the crew failed to respond effectively. In September 2016, Perry told People that \\"the boat now has enhanced fire fighting equipment and that the crew has been provided with refresher fire training.\\" No safety officials or third parties have been able to publicly verify the statement. In April 2017, The Wall Street Journal's Joe Palazzolo shined new light on the Hammer tragedy, citing a newly released Peruvian Navy report on the fire. Palazzolo writes, \\"The riverboat‚Äôs fire alarm 'did not operate at all,' and its crew, lacking training and equipment, took more than 20 minutes to enter the Hammers‚Äô cabin, Peruvian authorities said in an October report on the fire, citing a litany of violations of the nation‚Äôs maritime regulations.\\" He also explains the Death on the High Seas Act, which may allow International Expeditions to escape accountability for the Hammers' deaths. Because of the 1920 law, \\"the cruise industry enjoys broad immunity from damages in wrongful-death cases involving retirees and other passengers who have no financial dependents. International Expeditions, the Alabama-based company that charters the cruise and helped design the riverboat, has told the daughters through its lawyers that it has no financial obligation to the family under the law.\\" The Omaha World-Herald and Cruise Law News also covered the Peruvian Navy report. In the words of Jim Walker, a maritime lawyer and publisher of Cruise Law News, \\"The point to come away with after reading about this terrible ordeal is that this is the exactly the result that the cruise lines want after cruise passengers have been killed.\\" Walker also calls the Death on the High Seas Act \\"one of the cruelest and most unfair, if not completely callous, laws imaginable.\\" In July 2017, Good Morning America covered the Hammers' deaths and their family's ongoing legal efforts.

It is located near the town of Packwood and is popular for camping, boating, and hiking. The eastern half of the lake is within the Goat Rocks Wilderness. It is the deepest and second largest natural lake in Lewis County. Hydrology Walupt Lake is a ribbon lake situated near the end of a long glacial valley. The main inflow to Walupt Lake is the perennial, snowmelt-fed Walupt Creek, which flows out of a long valley into the east end of the lake. Other small streamlets flow into the lake from the steep valley walls above. The lake's watershed encompasses of land in the southern Goat Rocks. Besides the lake itself, the watershed comprises forest and otherwise unproductive land. Walupt Creek is also the lake's outflow, exiting the lake on its northwestern corner. The lake is somewhat boot-shaped with the toe pointed up the valley to the east. The widest part of the lake is on the western end at , and the longest part is the southern third at . The lake has an area of with an average depth of . It is the deepest lake in Lewis County and is also one of the deepest in Washington with a maximum depth of . The lake holds about of water, putting it among the top 25 lakes in Washington by volume. Walupt Lake was created by an ancient landslide when the ridge on the northwest end slid down and created a natural dam. History Surveyor Albert Hale Sylvester first assigned the name Walupt to the lake. The name is of Yakama origin, and Sylvester learned from Native Americans that Walupt was the Yakama name for the region. According to legend, a great Yakama hunter pursued a mighty deer for many days, until finally the deer led him to the lake. The deer jumped in, swam around for a while, and then disappeared. Since then, any hunter whose chase leads to the lake will sometimes see the deer swimming in the lake. Recreation The eastern half of Walupt Lake is within the Goat Rocks Wilderness of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Walupt Lake Campground is a popular campground and day use area on the west end of the lake with 42 primitive sites and a boat ramp. The campground is also a popular access point for the Goat Rocks Wilderness. While very little of the surrounding countryside is visible from the lake, once on the ridges above the lake, a hiker can see the surrounding Goat Rocks, Mount Adams off to the south and Mount Rainier to the northwest. The Nannie Ridge Trail #98 and Walupt Lake Trail #101 both start at the eastern end of the campground and provide different views of the wilderness and surrounding area on the way to their respective junctions with the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail.

It was developed by Eric Budish.  Background  CEEI (Competitive Equilibrium from Equal Incomes) is a fundamental rule for fair division of divisible resources. It divides the resources according to the outcome of the following hypothetical process: * Each agent receives a single unit of fiat money. This is the Equal Incomes part of CEEI. * The agents trade freely until the market attains a Competitive Equilibrium. This is a price-vector and an allocation, such that (a) each allocated bundle is optimal to its agent given his/her income - the agent cannot purchase a better bundle with the same income, and (b) the market clears - the sum of all allocations exactly equals the initial endowment. The equilibrium allocation is provably envy free and Pareto efficient. Moreover, when the agents have linear utility functions, the CEEI allocation can be computed efficiently. Unfortunately, when there are indivisibilities, a CEEI does not always exist, so it cannot be used directly for fair item assignment. However, it can be approximated, and the approximation has good fairness, efficiency and strategic properties.  Assumptions  A-CEEI only assumes that the agents know how to rank bundles of items. The ranking need not be weakly additive nor even monotone.  Procedure  A-CEEI with paramteres \\\\alpha,\\\\beta divides the resources according to the outcome of the following hypothetical process: *Approximate-EI: each agent receives an income between 1 and 1+\\\\beta. The exact income of each agent can be determined randomly, or by seniority (seniors can get a slightly higher income). * Approximate-CE: a price-vector and an allocation are calculated, such that (a) each allocated bundle is optimal to its agent given its budget, and (b) the market \\"almost\\" clears: the Euclidean distance between the sum of all allocations and the initial endowment is at most \\\\alpha. Budish proves that, for any \\\\beta>0 , there exists \\\\alpha,\\\\beta-CEEI where \\\\alpha depends on the minimum between the number of different item-types and the number of different items that an agent may receive.  Guarantees  The allocation satisfies the following properties: * Envy-free-except-1-item (see envy-free item assignment). * (n+1)-maximin-share-guarantee. * Pareto efficiency with respect to the allocated items. I.e, there is no Pareto-improving trade among the agents, but there may be Pareto-improving traders between an agent and the market-maker. Moreover, the A-CEEI mechanism is strategyproof \\"in the large\\": when there are many agents, each agent has only a small influence on the price, so the agents act as price takers. Then, it is optimal for each agent to report his true valuations, since it allows the mechanism to give him an optimal bundle given the prices.  Computation  The A-CEEI allocation is hard to compute: it is PPAD complete. However, in realistic-size problems, A-CEEI can be computed using a two-level search process: # Master level: the center uses tabu search to suggest prices; # Agent level: mixed integer programs are solved to find agent demands at the current prices. The agent-level program can be done in parallel for all agents, so this method scales near-optimally in the number of processors. acm.org The mechanism has been considered for the task of assigning students to courses at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.  Comparison to maximum-Nash welfare  The Maximum-Nash- Welfare (MNW) algorithm finds an allocation that maximizes the product of the agents' utilities. It is similar to A-CEEI in several respects: * Both algorithms find an EF-except-1 allocation. * Both algorithms approximate the maximin-share-guarantee. However, A-CEEI has several advantages: * It works with arbitrary utility functions - not only submodular ones. It does not even require monotonicity of preferences. * It works with ordinal input - the agents are only required to report their ranking over bundles - not their numeric valuation of items. * It is strategy proof \\"in the large\\". On the flip side, A-CEEI has several disadvantages: * There is an approximation error in the items that are allocated - some items might be in excess demand or excess supply. * In particular, the returned allocation is not Pareto-efficient - some items remain unallocated (it is Pareto-efficient only with respect to the allocated items). The approximation error of A-CEEI grows with the number of distinct items, but not with the number of players or the number of copies of each item. Therefore, A-CEEI is better when there are many agents and many copies of each item. A typical application is when the agents are students and the items are positions in courses. In contrast, MNW is better when there are few agents and many distinct items, such as in inheritance division.  Comparison to competitive equilibrium  A-CEEI (and CEEI in general) is related, but not identical, to the concept of competitive equilibrium. * Competitive equilibrium (CE) is a descriptive concept: it describes the situation in free market when the price stabilizes and the demand equals the supply. * CEEI is a normative concept: it describes a rule for dividing commodities between people.

The Commoner was a political paper of the early twentieth century that impacted a great deal of public opinion on critical matters.  History  Following two unsuccessful runs for the presidency Bryan returned to his roots in publishing and founded the paper in order to support the rights and liberties of American citizens. The first issue stated its goal as providing \\"aid to common people in the protection of their rights, the advancement of their interests and the realizations of their aspirations\\". The Commoner had a wide reach and subscriptions to the paper were delivered to every state. Before the first issue went to press on January 23, 1901 more than seventeen thousand advanced subscriptions had been placed. Within five years of publishing The Commoner had a paid subscription reach well above 100,000 readers. The publication practices followed by The Commoner were consistent with the more simplistic newspaper layouts. With an easy to digest three column design the paper was highly pleasing to the eye and could be sold at a very low price. Subscribers could purchase a years subscription for one dollar or purchase an individual issue for only a nickel a piece. In addition to its simple design, the narrative and rhetoric of the newspaper was engaging and understandable to the average man. By writing in a relatable manner The Commoner was able to introduce political discourse to daily life and discussions. From covering the election of Woodrow Wilson, outing government corruption, and fighting against imperialism the newspaper was always concerned with being a publication of patriotism. Although William Jennings Bryan enjoyed proclaiming himself sole editor-publisher, much of the work was also completed by his brother, Charlie W. Bryan. Charlie worked as both the managing and general editor of the newspaper and oversaw most of the content creation and production while Jennings Bryan toured and spoke across the country. While The Commoner would continue to gain substantial subscriptions the work of running a newspaper became too much for William Jennings Bryan and, when Woodrow Wilson appointed him his years as Secretary of State in 1913, the paper moved from being a weekly publication to a monthly. As owner of the newspaper Bryan published articles that followed his moral ideals which did not always align with the Democratic parties platform of the era. The Commoner always placed religious righteousness before bending to party doctrine. In all of its political coverage The Commoner never strayed from its belief in the teachings of the Bible and included sections of the paper such as \\"Mr. Bryan's Bible Talks\\". Within the articles published by Bryan the principles of Christianity are applied to political issues. Many of the editorials were written to support religiously influenced political reforms such as the prohibition movement or the denunciation of the evolutionary theory phenomenon. Due to his beliefs Bryan was politically ostracized by other Democrats and retreated to The Commoner where he promoted policies like the Nebraska statewide referendum on woman suffrage and supporting the mobilization of the United States in World War I. The different party attitudes weighed heavily on Bryan and this political digression is evident within the articles published by The Commoner. In addition to the political correspondences, Will M. Maupin wrote the column \\"Whether Common Or Not\\" for The Commoner. The column included poems, comic stories, anecdotes, and only contained a bit of political discourse. Bryan wrote the foreword for a 1903 republication of Maupin's columns from paper and stated the column to be for people who enjoyed \\"innocent fun, delicate humor, and philosophy seasoned with sentiment\\". William Jennings Bryan was the Commoner and the opinions and discourse of his paper mattered to many citizens and informed voters on policies for over two decades. However, due to the failing health of Bryan and the appointment of Charles Bryan as Nebraska governor, the paper could not be sustained and in April 1923, after 768 publications, the last issue of The Commoner was produced.

As a two-year-old in 2015 she failed to win a group race but showed consistently high-class form, winning a valuable sales race, finishing second in the Silver Flash Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf, third in the Moyglare Stud Stakes and fourth in the Cheveley Park Stakes. In the following year she was beaten in her first four races but finished third in both the 1000 Guineas and the Coronation Stakes. She then won three Group One races in her next four starts taking the Falmouth Stakes, Matron Stakes and Sun Chariot Stakes. Background Alice Springs is chestnut mare with a white blaze and four white socks bred in Ireland by Lynch-Bages & Longfield Stud. She was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo is now one of the world's leading stallions and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland five times. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Found, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Ruler of the World and Minding. Alice Springs's dam Aleagueoftheirown showed limited racing ability, winning one race from twelve starts between 2006 and 2009. She was a granddaughter of Optimistic Lass, who won the Nassau Stakes in 1984 and was the female-line ancestor of Golden Opinion and the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Samitar. As a yearling Alice Springs was offered for sale at Tattersalls in October 2014 and was bought for 550,000 guineas by Michael Magnier on behalf of his father, John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation. She was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of her ownership have changed from race to race: she has sometimes been listed as being the property of Susan Magnier., whilst on other occasions she has been described as being owned by a partnership of Magnier, Michael Tabor and Derrick Smith. Racing career=2015: two-year-old season Alice Springs made her racecourse debut in a seven furlong maiden race at the Curragh on 26 June in which she was ridden by Seamie Heffernan and started the 6/4 favourite against eleven other fillies. She took the lead in the final furlong and went clear to win \\"going away\\" by two and a half lengths from the Jim Bolger-trained Siamsaiocht. She was immediately moved up to Group Three class and started favourite for the Silver Flash Stakes over the same distance at Leopardstown Racecourse in July but was beaten one and a quarter lengths by the Dermot Weld-trained Tanaza. In August at the Curragh she was one of three Ballydoyle runners to contest the Group Two Debutante Stakes and finished fifth behind her stablemates Ballydoyle and Minding. On 13 September Alice Springs was moved up to Group One level for the Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh and finished third beaten three quarters of a length and half a length by Minding and Ballydoyle. Two weeks later she was sent to England and dropped in distance to contest the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Ryan Moore she kept on well in the closing stages and finished fourth, one and a half lengths behind the winner Lumiere. Seven days later she returned to Newmarket for the Tattersalls Millions 2yo Fillies' Trophy, a race restricted to fillies sold at Tattersalls. Ridden by Moore she started 2/5 favourite with the best-fancied of her eleven opponents being her fellow Irish raider Clear Skies. After tracking the leaders she took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by four lengths. On her final appearance of the season Alice Springs was sent to the United States and started 7/4 favourite for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf at Keeneland Racecourse on 30 October. After starting slowly she squeezed through a gap on the rail to make her challenge in the final furlong but was beaten three quarters of a length into second by Catch A Glimpse. 2016: three-year-old seasonSpring= On her three-year-old debut Alice Springs started favourite for the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes on heavy ground on 10 April but never looked likely to win and finished third behind Jet Setting and Now Or Never. On 1 May she contested the 203rd running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley mile at Newmarket in which she started a 16/1 outsider and finished third of the sixteen runners behind Minding and Ballydoyle. Two weeks after her run in the Newmarket classic she started at odds of 3/1 in the French equivalent, the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse but faded in the closing stages and finished seventh behind La Cressonniere. =Summer= On 17 June Alice Springs was back in England for the Group One Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and produced a much better effort. After racing towards the rear of the field and then being repeatedly obstructed as Moore attempted to obtain a clear run, she finished strongly and finished third behind Qemah and Nemoralia, with Jet Setting, Tanaza and Now Or Never among the beaten horses. On her next appearance Alice Springs was matched against older fillies and mares for the first time in the Group One Falmouth Stakes over one mile at Newmarket's July course. She started the 5/2 second favouriter behind the French four-year-old Usherette (Duke of Cambridge Stakes), whilst the best- fancied of the five runners was the five-year-old mare Amazing Maria who had won the race in 2015. She raced in third place behind the outsiders Very Special and Irish Rookie before taking the lead a furlong out. She stayed on well despite drifting to the right in the closing stages to win by two and a quarter lengths and a nose from Very Special and Always Smile in a new track record time of 1.34.24. After the race Ryan Moore said \\"She's definitely improving. The trainer said that beforehand and he's usually right. I was in front earlier than I would have liked but the way the race was run I had no choice\\". At the end of July Alice Springs returned to Deauville and started fovourite for the Group One Prix Rothschild. Her second visit to France turned out to be another disappointment as she finished eight of the ten runners behind Qemah after being eased down by Moore the last 200 metres when her winning chance had gone. =Autumn= Alice Sprints at the 2016 Breeders' Cup On 10 September she made her first appearance in her native country for five months when she met Qemah for the third time in the Group One Matron Stakes over a mile at Leopardstown. Qemah started favourite ahead of the undefeated British filly Persuasive with Alice Springs the 5/1 third choice in the betting in an eight-runner field which also included Jet Setting, Now Or Never and the German 1,000 Guineas winner Hawksmoor. Moore restrained the filly and was still in last place with two furlongs to run, but Alice Springs produced a strong run on the outside, took the lead 150 yards from the finish and drew clear to win by three and a quarter lengths from Persuasive. After the race O'Brien said \\"It was a bit of a disaster in France. She went and it was shifty, patchy ground in Deauville. Ryan knew she wasn't going to be involved so he just minded her. She's a very good filly. You saw what she did in the Falmouth as well. She has a lot of speed. She quickened up very well. She's very pacey.\\" Three weeks after her win at Leopardstown the filly was back in England for the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket and was made the 13/8 favourite in an eight-runner field. Always Smile and Irish Rookie were again in opposition whilst her other rivals included Ervedya (winner of the Poule d'Essai des Poulins, Coronation Stakes and Prix du Moulin in 2015), Volta (runner-up in the Prix Rothschild) and Arabian Queen. After racing in fourth place she made a forward move in the last quarter mile and went to the front approaching the final furlong. She kept on well under pressure in the closing stages and won by three quarters of a length from Always Smile with Ervedya a length away in third place. After the race Moore said \\"She picked up very well and she was just dozing a little bit when I got serious with her, but she found a bit more\\". When asked about the filly's prospects in the Breeders' Cup Mile he added \\"Santa Anita will suit her, but Tepin will be hard to beat\\". Alice Springs did contest the Breeders' Cup Mile on 5 November and started the 4.2/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Limato, Tepin and Ironicus. She made little impact in the race and finished tenth of the fourteen runners behind Tourist. 2017: four-year-old season On her first appearance of 2017, Alice Springs started 6/4 favourite for the Gladness Stakes over seven furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 9 April but after briefly taking the lead in the final furlong she was overtaken and beaten half a length by Diamond Fields, to whom she was conceding five pounds in weight.

Origin Mobile 3.7-inch HAA gun preserved at the Imperial War Museum, Duxford. Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) was formed on 20 May 1940 at 211th AA Training Regiment (AATR) at Park Hall Camp, Oswestry, and the regiment comprised 322, 323 and 324 HAA Batteries, formed at 206th (\\"Arborfield), 210th (Oswestry) and 211th AATRs respectively.Frederick, pp. 757‚Äì8, 780.Farndale, Annex M.103 HAA Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45.103 HAA Rgt War Diary 1940‚Äì41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/2392. Although formally part of the Territorial Army (TA) ‚Äì it was the first new TA HAA unit formed after the outbreak of war ‚Äì it had no territorial affiliation. Acting Lt-Col J.R.W. Curtois was appointed to command the regiment on 4 July. John Ralph Willoughby Curtois (1897‚Äì1970) had been commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1915 and won a Military Cross during World War I. He was a major when war broke out, and was promoted to the substantive rank of Lt-Col on 15 June 1942. Half-Yearly Army List January 1939.London Gazette, 20 September 1935.London Gazette 17 July 1942.Curtois family of Lincolnshire. The regiment was assigned to 33rd (Western) Anti-Aircraft Brigade in Liverpool, forming part of 4th AA Division.Farndale, Annex D.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. After attending practice camps, the batteries moved to Liverpool to take over gun sites from other regiments, including 93rd (3rd West Lancashire) HAA Rgt, which also transferred some of its men to the 103rd. These sites were variously equipped with static 4.5-inch, mobile or static 3.7-inch, or old 3-inch guns. RHQ was established at Gateacre, then at Woolton Park, and later at Croxteth Hall. The regiment's guns became operational on the night of 15/16 July, guarding against enemy aircraft laying Parachute mines in the Mersey, scoring its first 'kill' on 23/24 July. The Blitz Panoramic view of bomb damage in Liverpool During the summer of 1940, while the Battle of Britain raged over the skies of Southern England by day, there were also night raids on industrial cities. Liverpool was heavily attacked for four nights in a row from 28 August, and the regiment was in action almost nightly thereafter, firing almost 2000 rounds during a heavy attack on the night of 28/29 November.Routledge, Table LXII, p. 379‚Äì80; p. 385. In mid-November the regiment provided a cadre of experienced men to 211th AATR to form a new 390 Bty for the neighbouring 107th HAA Rgt. 93rd, 103rd and 107th HAA Rgts in 33rd AA Bde regularly exchanged gun sites around Liverpool and Birkenhead. The night raids continued into the following Spring, during which period the city and its docks along the Mersey became the most heavily bombed area of Britain outside London. The campaign became known as the Liverpool Blitz, with particularly heavy attacks in December 1940 (the Christmas Blitz) when the regiment's ammunition expenditure rose to almost 3800 rounds per night; in April 1941; and again the following month (the May Blitz).Routledge, pp. 394‚Äì5. Mobile training In May 1941 the regiment began to reorganise as a mobile unit, with additional vehicles. It began mobile training in August and then took part in large scale exercises before returning to the Mersey sites in the autumn, where it was regularly in action again. In the autumn of 1940 the regiment had sent a cadre to 210th AATR at Oswestry to provide the basis for a new 390 Bty; this was formed on 14 November 1940 and later joined 107th HAA Rgt. Shortly afterwards, 107th HAA Rgt supplied a cadre to 207th AATR at Devizes, which was formed on 10 April 1941 and was regimented with 103rd HAA Rgt on 7 July, immediately taking over some gun sites.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79.

In February 1942 the Mersey received its first daylight air raid for over a year.103 HAA Rgt War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7471. The regiment remained in 33rd AA Bde until April 1942, when it transferred to 55th AA Bde in 8th AA Division in Cornwall. RHQ and 323 Btys were established at St Ives, 322 Bty at Truro and 324 Bty at Penzance. 420 Bty transferred to a new 140 HAA Rgt on 19 April.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81. In West Cornwall the main threat was from low level 'hit and run' raids by single-engined Luftwaffe aircraft (such as attacks by pairs of Focke-Wulf Fw 190s on St Ives on 28 August and Truro on 7 September), which were difficult for HAA guns to engage. Night raids on Truro on 24 September and on Penzance two nights later were engaged by the regiment with both HAA and light machine guns.Routledge, pp. 401‚Äì2. Apart from a short training deployment in Hampshire in the summer (when the regiment formed a temporary No 7 Troop to continue manning a site at Land's End), 103rd HAA Rgt remained in Cornwall until October 1942. 322 Bty handed over its sites and became non-operational on 28 October, and then the whole regiment was relieved on 20 November and moved to join the RA Battle Training Group at Hertford for mobile training. Mobile HAA regiments had an establishment of three batteries each of two troops, with a total of 24 towed 3.7-inch They also had their own Royal Corps of Signals signal detachment, and a Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) workshop, which was permanently attached to the regiment from 1 December.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 18 February 1943, TNA file WO 212/9.

The regiment left AA Command and joined the newly-formed 76th AA Bde at Blandford Camp on 21 December 1942. Then when 80th AA Bde was formed at Blandford in April 1943, 103rd HAA Rgt transferred to its command. Both 76th and 80th AA Bdes were mobile formations organised in Home Forces specifically for the planned invasion of Europe (Operation Overlord).103 HAA Rgt War Diary, 1943, TNA file WO 166/11586.76 AA Bde War Diary, December 1942, TNA file WO 166/7433.76 AA Bde War Diary, 1943, TNA file WO 166/11247.80 AA Bde War Diary 1943, TNA file WO WO 166/11248. In March and April the regiment handed over its 3.7-inch guns to active regiments in AA Command and re-equipped with the obsolescent 3-inch gun for mobile training. This included beach landing demonstrations and training with the Beach groups that had been formed for Overlord. 220 Battery of 73rd LAA Rgt, assigned to the same beach group, also joined the regiment for training. During the summer of 1943, the regiment trained intensively, attending gunnery practice camps at Redesdale and Ramsgate, training for beach landings in Scotland and Pembrokeshire, and then another practice camp at Whitby in November. That month the regiment handed in its 3-inch guns and was fully equipped with 24 of the modern 3.7-inch gun. At the end of the year the regiment was stationed across Ross & Cromarty and Renfrewshire.103 HAA Rgt War Diary, January‚ÄìMay 1944, TNA file WO 166/14783. Lieutenant-Colonel Curtois was replaced as CO on 16 February 1944 by Lt-Col H.E. Johnston. Howard Erskine Johnston had experienced rapid promotion since he had been commissioned as a TA 2nd Lieutenant in the 93rd HAA Rgt early in 1939, becoming an acting Lt-Col in November 1942.Monthly Army List. Training continued in Scotland during early 1944, alongside 3rd British Division, which the regiment would support on D-Day. In the spring the regiment moved to Monks Common Camp at Mannings Heath in West Sussex. Then in May the units of 80th AA Bde moved to their marshalling areas to embark for the invasion.80 AA Bde War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085. D-Day For the Normandy landings, 80th AA Bde was assigned to support I Corps landing on Juno and Sword Beaches, while 76th AA Brigade supported XXX Corps on Gold Beach. The leading elements were to land with the assault waves on D-Day itself (6 June). Light AA defence was emphasised at the start of the operation, since low-level attack by Luftwaffe aircraft was considered the most likely threat. However, 103rd HAA Rgt was designated to land on the second tide on D-Day with minimum scales of equipment, to be brought up to strength by parties arriving later.Routledge, pp. 305‚Äì7. The leading units were formed into AA Assault Groups, and Lt-Col Johnstone with RHQ of 103rd HAA Rgt took charge of 'N' AA Assault Group landing on Queen Sector of Sword Beach under the command of 3rd British Division. The assault group included 220/73rd LAA Bty equipped with towed and self-propelled (SP) 40 mm Bofors guns and a troop of 93rd LAA Rgt equipped with the new 20 mm Polsten gun in triple mountings, half of them mounted on Crusader tank chassis. The HAA guns were to land on the second tide, with the officer commanding 323/103 HAA Bty in command of all AA units landing on this tide.Joslen, p. 583.80 AA Bde Operation Order No 1, 20 May 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085.'M' & 'N' Assault Groups Operation Order No 1, TNA file WO 166/14783.

Among this group, B Troop of 322/103 HAA Bty would have a secondary coastal artillery role to protect shipping off Queen sector from attack by German E-boats, particularly at night. For this purpose 16 Fire Control Post and 76 and 103 Coast Observer detachments were landed with it. The guns would either fire blind, controlled by radar, or with the assistance of searchlights. Reconnaissance parties from 103rd HAA Rgt landed on Queen sector between Ouistreham and Luc-sur-Mer during the late afternoon of D-day, but attempts to land HAA guns on the beaches during the second tide were hampered by a lack of Rhino ferries and by damaged towing gear. By nightfall, only two of 103rd HAA's guns were ashore, and these were without instruments. Nevertheless, they came into action against raids at dusk and were credited with destroying two enemy aircraft. Luckily, Luftwaffe attacks on D-Day were few and sporadic, and more HAA guns began to come ashore the following day (D+1).103 HAA Rgt War Diary, June‚ÄìDecember 1944, TNA file WO 171/1150.Routledge, pp. 308‚Äì10. Once the initial landings had been achieved, the AA Assault Groups were broken up and reorganised by regimental groups, the regimental commander becoming AA Defence Commander (AADC) for the local area: 103 HAA Rgt Gp * All units 103rd HAA Rgt * 160 AAOR * 16 Fire Control Post * 76 & 103 Coast Observation Detachments * B & C Troops, 474 S/L Bty attached Normandy As the build-up in the Normandy beachhead grew during June and July 1944, 80th AA Bde was tasked with protecting Juno and Sword beaches, the small port of Ouistreham, and the Orne and Caen Canal bridges.Routledge, p. 308; Table XLIX, p. 319. B Troop took up its coast defence position at Ouistreham on D+2, where it came under enemy artillery fire, suffering some casualties and damage. As part of the coast defence role, Gun Control Radar sets were used to plot Parachute mines being dropped by German aircraft in the anchorage (though the AA guns were forbidden to engage them for fear of causing casualties among the shipping). Given the low intensity of air attacks, HAA guns in the bridgehead were sometimes made available to fire on ground targets for bombardment, counter-battery and anti-tank shoots. For example, on 13 June the regiment fired 100 rounds per gun on ground targets in collaboration with 4th Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA), and C Troop carried out shoots on Caen with 53rd Medium Rgt on 22 and 23 June.Routledge, pp. 312‚Äì7.101 Sub-Area Notes, 18 March 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085. A Matador tows a 3.7-inch HAA gun through the ruins of Caen in August 1944. July continued the same pattern: a number of AA rounds expended most nights, more fired in support of ground operations around Caen, and a trickle of casualties from occasional shellfire and bombs. From 7 to 9 July, 324 Bty fired at enemy observation posts (OPs) and other targets in the Colombelles factory area while I Corps attacked Caen (Operation Charnwood). At the beginning of August, 103rd HAA Rgt was redeployed, with one 8-gun battery east of the Orne and the remainder concentrated round the canal bridges. Lt-Col Johnston was later awarded an OBE for his work during Operation Overlord.80 AA Bde War Diary 1945, TNA file WO WO 171/4893.Johnston's citation in TNA file WO 373/83/124.Times 2 February 1945. Breakout 21st Army Group broke out from the Normandy beachhead at the end of August and began to pursue the defeated German troops across Northern France. AA defence of the beachhead became less important and 80th AA Bde was released from its commitments there in order to follow the advance. 103rd HAA Regiment remained in the Caen‚ÄìOuistreham area under the command of the newly-arrived 75th AA Bde.Routledge, Table L, p. 327. On 12 September, 103rd HAA Rgt became mobile again, with its own 44 three- tonner lorries supplemented by the 30 of 1613 Platoon, Royal Army Service Corps. The regiment rejoined 80th AA Bde at the liberated port of Dieppe, where the responsibilities included security of a large Prisoner-of-war camp, and helping to unload ships at the docks. The regiment next moved in early October to Boulogne, where it came under the command of 103rd AA Bde.Routledge, Table LI, pp. 328‚Äì9; Table LII, pp. 330‚Äì1. Belgium Large targets in the liberated areas such as Brussels and the port of Antwerp were vulnerable to attack by V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers'), and GHQ planned large-scale AA defence schemes for the cities, 'Antwerp X' and 'Brussels X', integrating guns and early warning radar. At the beginning of October, 80th AA Bde began to equip its HAA units with Radar No 3 Mark V (the SCR-584 radar set) and No 10 Predictors (the all-electric Bell Labs AAA Computer), and began training operators on them in preparation for tracking these small fast-moving targets. 103rd HAA Rgt received its first of these new items on 3 October at Dieppe. The first 'Diver' was launched against Brussels on 21 October. 103rd HAA Rgt arrived from Boulogne on 28 October, and reverted to the command of 80th AA Bde for training on the new radar and predictors. It then deployed to Leuven, east of Brussels, on 9 November, where it reinforced 101st AA Bde.Routledge, pp. 333‚Äì4; Table LIII, p. 342. By mid-December, the Royal Navy had become concerned about the safety of the channel leading from Zeebrugge up the Scheldt Estuary to the vital supply base of Antwerp, and more HAA guns were sent to cover it. The number of V-1s fired at Brussels was considerably lower than at Antwerp, and it was possible to relieve some of the defending units there, so 103rd HAA Rgt (less 322 Bty), was sent from the Brussels X defences to Knokke. Here it deployed at Zeebrugge and Cadzand along with 73rd LAA Rgt and 413 Bty 54th Searchlight Rgt, coming under the operational command of 105th AA Bde (then of 75th AA Bde from January 1945) as part of the 'Scheldt South' deployment. Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston of 103rd HAA Rgt was appointed AADC Scheldt Approaches.103 HAA Rgt War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4912.Routledge, pp. 335, 340. 322 HAA Battery remained under 101st AA Bde at Jodoigne in the Brussels X belt until it rejoined the regiment in late January. On 1 January 1945, the Luftwaffe launched Operation Bodenplatte: daylight attacks by single-engined fighters against Allied airfields in support of the Ardennes offensive; the Scheldt Approaches guns claimed to have shot down six of these.Routledge, p. 346‚Äì7. That month the regiment began to receive the machine fuze setter MFS No 11A, which increased the rate of fire of the 3.7-inch gun to 20 rounds per minute.Routledge, pp. 77, 334, 407; Appendix C, p. 87. Also at that time the regimental REME workshops were withdrawn and replaced by smaller regimental detachments from 75th AA Bde workshops. The regiment's guns were active against night raids in late January, which were believed to cover for minelaying aircraft. The regiment began to practice radar tracking for these minelayers. In March, it lent a platoon of its AEC Matador HAA gun tractors to 21st Army Group to assist in transporting engineering stores for the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder). As the Allied forces advanced into Germany the air threat dwindled. The last V-1 landed at Antwerp on 29 March, and the AA defences in Belgium were concentrated round the Scheldt, where 103rd HAA came under the command of 5th Royal Marine AA Bde.80 AA Bde War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4893.Routledge, p. 361; Table LVII, p. 366. Disbandment By late April 1945, a number of AA units were deemed surplus to requirements.Routledge, p. 348. The regiment was ordered to concentrate at Hoogerheide on 23 April and come under the command of 76th AA Bde, which was handling unit disbandments and conversions to other roles. 103rd HAA Rgt was converted into a driver training unit, for which it was joined by 64th HAA Rgt's REME workshop. The first intake of potential drivers arrived just before VE Day. The regiment passed to 50th AA Bde shortly afterwards.76 AA Bde War Diary, January‚ÄìJuly 1945, TNA file WO 171/4889. The regiment continued in this role until it was disbanded on 20 November 1945. Unlike pre-war TA units which went into 'suspended animation', it was not reformed in the postwar TA.

Based in Asti, California, Italian Swiss Colony was at one time the leading wine producer in California. Establishment and growth In 1881, Andrea Sbarboro founded an agricultural colony at Asti (named for Asti in Italy), primarily focused on grapes. Sbarboro's intent was to establish a profitable enterprise which would provide work for the many Italians who had migrated to San Francisco (although there were at first some Italian Swiss from Ticino, thus giving the colony its name, it soon became an entirely Italian-American enterprise.) The corporation had originally been organized to allow the workers to eventually buy ownership, but this never developed, and it remained a normal joint-stock company. In 1887, a collapse in grape prices forced the company to construct a winery and begin wine production itself. Key personnel in these early years, besides Sbarboro, were Charles Kohler, Paolo de Vecchi, and Pietro Rossi. Rossi led the company to develop its own agencies to sell directly to eastern markets; soon after the wine was being sold in Europe, South America, and Asia. The huge wine cistern (capacity ) that Sbarboro had had built became a tourist attraction. By 1905, the wines had won medals at various international competitions. By 1910 the company owned over in various holdings in the Central Valley. As the movement for prohibition of alcohol in the United States grew, Sbarboro became a leading spokesman for wine and temperance, but lived to see the beginning of prohibition on January 16, 1920. After prohibition Wine vaults, around 1940 The Italian Swiss Colony operation (then owned by National Distillers) was acquired in 1953 by Louis Petri of Petri Wine (founded in 1886). Petri shepherded the growth of Italian Swiss Colony as a mass-market brand; wine was shipped in tankers to be bottled in New York. Television ads featuring Ludwig St√∂ssel (voiced by Jim Backus; yodeling by Bob Oates) with the catchphrase \\"The little old winemaker ‚Äì me!\\" appeared regularly on American national television. (Dean Martin and others recorded a song titled on a parody of that line, \\"Little Old Wine Drinker Me\\".) The company later became part of United Vintners (organized by Louis Petri and others), then was sold to Heublein in 1969, and later sold by Heublein to Allied Growers. By 1987, the company had been renamed to ISC Wines and the brand from Italian Swiss Colony to just Colony (ISC also had other brands, including jug wine label Petri). In 1987 Allied Growers sold ISC Wines to Erly Industries, who merged it with Sierra Wine Company into a new entity. In 2015 the descendant of the company, now operating under the name Asti Winery and selling wine under the Souverain brand, and owning America's sixth- largest wine production facility, was purchased by E & J Gallo Winery from its owner, Australia-based Treasury Wine Estates.

The attack was carried out by the loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) just less than two weeks before the start of the Ulster Workers' Council strike of May 1974 which brought down the Sunningdale power sharing agreement and just 15 days before the UVF carried out the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which killed 34 and injured 300 people, the highest casualty rate in a single day during The Troubles in either Ireland or Britain. Background Loyalists and Unionist from nearly all political and social backgrounds reacted with anger to the Sunningdale agreement in particular the part that offered the Dublin government a say in how Northern Ireland would be governed. Many young Loyalists joined the Loyalist paramilitary groups like the UVF and Ulster Defence Association (UDA). In the weeks leading up to May 1974 the Loyalist paramilitaries had intensified their campaign. On 9 February the UDA shot dead two Catholic civilians in a bar in Belfast Two days later on 11 February two more Catholics were killed by the UDA/UFF. On 19 February the UVF killed two more civilians in a bomb attack on a pub in Armagh. On 29 March the UVF bombed Conways bar in Belfast killing two more Catholic civilians. On 21 April the UVF shot dead a Sinn F√©in member in Fermanagh. The Bombing At around 22:00 pm terrorists belonging to the UVF (Ulster Volunteer Force) threw a cylinder bomb laden with 200lb of high explosives through the front door of the Catholic-owned Rose & Crown bar on the Lower Ormeau Road. The bomb exploded immediately once inside. The explosion brought the front of the entrance crashing down making it impossible for people to escape. Five Catholics were killed outright with one more dying from his wounds a day or two later. Eyewitnesses described scenes of men missing legs or arms and one man blown in half. A 75-year-old man lost a leg and another man his arm. One of the victims, a 17-year-old boy, was walking past the bar when the bomb went off; the blast was so powerful that it blew both his legs off and killed him instantly. Aftermath Memorial to the dead in the Rose & Crown bomb, Farnham Street, Belfast A white sedan seen near the building was later found abandoned in a Protestant area half a mile away. Two teenagers were eventually arrested and jailed for the bombings. Loyalist paramilitaries killed a total of 51 one people the majority of whom were killed in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings 17 May and injured about 400 in the month of May 1974 alone making May 1974 the worst month out of the whole conflict for Loyalist paramilitary attacks. In 2014 for the 40th anniversary of the bombing a monument near the bomb site was dedicated to the victims of the UVF atrocity.

Plot  Whistle is an orphaned boy, raised in an environment unsuitable for a budding child and thief. A shady lawyer, an accomplice of thieves and fences, entrusts him to Nino, the leader of a gang that is preparing a particularly valuable coup. On the appointed day, Whistle and Beb√®, accompanied by Nino who passes himself off as an employer, must present themselves at Countess Barenghi's house as chimney sweeps, but Whistle seriously injures himself falling from the chimney and sends the blow upstream. Anna, who has lost a small son and has begun to become attached to the child, pretends to be his mother to take him away but the doctor, called by the countess, forbids him to move. The two thus live a few days in that strange house, during which they become attached to each other. In the meantime, Nino, feeling abandoned, has found a new lover in Mary, a no good one who follows him in the planned coup but who, in an attempt to take possession of the stolen goods, reports him to the police. Nino manages to go untraceable after hiding the loot in Anna's house who, unaware of everything, returns a few days later with Whistle and where the police end up finding it. Anna is obviously arrested while Whistle (who in the meantime had him baptized giving him the name Paolo, that of her missing son), ends up in a boarding school at the expense of the countess, who believes in the innocence of the woman and also pays the expenses of a lawyer. With the support of Don Pietro and the same lawyer, Anna reacts firmly to prove her innocence, which will only happen with Nino's arrest.

He meets Luke Cage, the main character, who looks out for him on the streets. Lonnie is taken into custody for questioning about Luke Cage, and is given a brutal beating by one of the police officers. This leads to a leak of the abusive treatment to the media by corrupt politicians--for their own benefit. In this role, he is a supporter of Luke's whom he knows is innocent of the crimes he has allegedly committed. In December, 2016, Netflix announced that Luke Cage would air for a second season.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the pastures and meadows of the Golan Heights in Israel and Syria. It has linear, upright leaves, tall slender stem holding a bi-coloured flower, having a pale lilac, cream-yellow, light tan, or white background, which is then covered in purple brown, or purple, or purple-pink veining, spots or speckling. It has a round purple-brown or almost black signal patch, and a sparse purple brown or almost black beard. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, as it needs very dry conditions during the summer. Description It is a geophyte, with a stout compact rhizome.British Iris Society (1997) Which separates it from Iris bismarckiana (another Oncocyclus Iris), with a similar flower form and other morphological characters, but which has a stoloniferous rhizome. It has 9 leaves, which are linear, straight and erect. Compared to Iris westii (another Oncocyclus Iris), which are short and curved. The leaves can grow up to between long and 1.8 cm wide. It has a slender stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. The stems hold terminal (top of stem) flowers, blooming early in the season, between March and April, or between April to May (in the UK). The flowers are between in diameter, they are considered to be the largest single flower in Israel. They are bi-coloured, and are pale lilac, creamy, cream-yellow, light tan, or white background. They are then covered in purple brown, or purple, or purple-pink, veining, spots or speckling. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are obovate and very recurved, and they measure long and wide. The colour and thickness of the veining or speckling can vary. In the centre of the petal is a signal patch, which is orbicular (round), purple-brown, or almost black, and 1.2 cm long and 1.5 cm wide. Also in the middle of the falls, a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is sparse and has purple brown, or almost black hairs. The standards are sub-orbicular and they measure long and wide. They are paler than the falls. It has cream, or yellow anthers, with purple filaments, and creamy white style branches. Compared to Iris atropurpurea and Iris haynei, it has a very short flowering time of between (3.6 ¬± 0.8 days). After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, which has not yet been described. Biochemistry As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=20, similar to other Oncocyclus irises. Taxonomy It is commonly known as 'Golan Iris', 'Hermon Iris', or 'Mt. Hermon iris'. It is also written in Hebrew as ◊ê÷¥◊ô◊®◊ï÷º◊° ◊î÷∑◊ó÷∂◊®÷∞◊û◊ï÷π◊ü, and written in Arabic as ÿ£ŸÑŸÑŸëÿ∫ÿ© ÿ¢ŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®ŸäŸëÿ© ÿ≥Ÿàÿ≥ŸÜ ÿ¨ÿ®ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ¥ŸäÿÆ. The Latin specific epithet hermona refers to Mount Hermon, between Israel and Syria,David Gledhill although most of the currant plants are found in the Golan Heights. It was first found in Kunaytrah, Palestine, in 1912, and described by Wilhelm Bacher. Although it was first published and named by John E. Dinsmore in 'Flora of Syria, Palestine, and Sinai' (edited G. E. Post) by Vol.2 on page 596, in 1933. It was also published in 1934 in Fasc. II. 8 (Publ. Am. Univ. Beirut, Nat. Sc. Series No. 1 and No.3). In 1968, Bastow (within his article 'Oncocylus Irises, Part II', in The Iris Year Book 1968) thought that the species was similar in form to Iris bismarckiana except from having different types of rhizomes. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then changed on 1 December 2004. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, and in the Catalogue of Life, as well as being tentatively accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat Iris from near Katzrin, Golan Heights It is native to temperate western Asia. Range It is endemic to Israel, (including the Golan Heights, Keshet, and Mount Hermon, ) and Syria. Habitat It grows in open places like pasture lands, on the edges of oak scrub, steppes, or rocky meadows. On heavy soils, including rocky basalt, heavy basalt soils. or dark brown limestone soils. Pollination Generally, most Oncocyclus irises (including I. hermona) are pollinated by night-sheltering male bees (male eucerine bees). Conservation I. hermona is currently assessed as being a Vulnerable species, since 2016, it is very rare on the Golan Heights and on Mount Hermon. In the past, it has been picked and uprooted due to its flowers, attacked by herbivore (such as porcupine, caterpillars and true-bugs), also its habitat has suffered from military tank exercises and other military exercises on the Golan. The populations have also been affected by cattle grazing, settlement development (housing) and the creation of vineyards and other agricultural development. The iris is a protected wildflower, and fortunately some populations of the iris can be found inside a couple of mine fields. In Keshet, Golan a settlement area was widened, and a population of the iris was trans-located, but after 3 years only 6 plants had survived out of 120 (meaning 5%). Cultivation right I. hermona is thought to be an easier plant to grow in cultivation, as it can tolerate a Mediterranean climate. In general 'Oncocyclus Section' Irises need good drainage, minimal summer rainfall and dry winters, similar to a semi-arid climate. In temperate areas (such as the Europe and America), they are only suitable for growing in specialist iris growers, within a bulb frame or greenhouse. They can be grown under glass (in frames), to protect the irises from excess moisture (especially during winter times) and also to ensure the (shallow planted) rhizomes get the best temperatures during the growing season. They can be grown in pots (especially in deep ones known as 'long toms'), but they need re-potting, every 2 years and extra feeding. Watering is one of the most critical aspects of iris cultivation. It can suffer from aphids, viruses and rots. Israel's national collection of Oncocyclus iris is held at Ramat HaNadiv the burial place of Baron Edmond de Rothschild (1845‚Äì1934). It has an iris garden (which includes I. hermona, Iris mariae, Iris atropurpurea and other Oncocyclus irises) as well as a large propagation system for growing more irises. Propagation Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Irises generally require a period of cold, then a period of warmth and heat, also they need some moisture. Some seeds need stratification, (the cold treatment), which can be carried out indoors or outdoors. Seedlings are generally potted on (or transplanted) when they have 3 leaves. Oncocyclus irises dislike division, but it should only be carried out when the plant is overcrowded. Although hand pollination and germinating seedlings gives better results. Hybrids and cultivars It has one cultivar called 'Hermona'. It has various crosses including; 'Aviv' (I. atropurpurea x I. hermona) X (I. atropurpurea x I. hermona), 'Bagdad Beauty', 'Doar Na' (I. hermona X Iris iberica), 'Galeet' (Iris haynei crossed with I. hermona ), 'Gilmond' (I. haynei crossed with I. hermona), 'Goren' (Iris mariae X I. hermona), 'Leat' (Iris atropurpurea X I. hermona) X (I. atropurpurea x I. hermona, 'New Enchantment' (I. hermona X Iris susiana) X self, 'Noga' (I. atropurpurea X I. hermona), 'Orit' (Iris samariae X I. hermona), 'Ravid' (Onco Hybrid 'Judean Charmer' (1956) X I. hermona), 'Reaem' (I. hermona X Onco hybrid 'Judean Charmer'), 'Sa'ar' (Iris mariae X I. hermona), 'Tameer' (I. atropurpurea X I. hermona) X I. hermona), Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske Culture It is also found on the roof of a medieval grave of a local sheikh in the Golan Heights. On 19 June 2016, the National Gallery of Art in Vilnius, held an exhibition of photos by photographer Sharon Ya‚Äôari, I. hermona was included as part of his \\"Red Slide\\" series (2015).

On 22 May 1810 seized Donna Marianna for breach of the Act for the abolition of the slave trade. The Vice admiralty court at Freetown, Sierra Leone, condemned Donna Mariana and her owners appealed the decision. The result of the appeal was a finding against the owners in a case that became an important milestone in the suppression of the slave trade. The passage of the Act abolishing the slave trade does not mean that English vessels stopped trading slaves. A number of Liverpool merchants initially engaged in subterfuge, selling their vessels to nominal owners in other countries that had not yet abolished the trade. The case of Donna Marianna established the precedent that British warships could detain, and British Vice admiralty courts could condemn, vessels under foreign flags, and their cargo, where British ownership could be proved. Facts of the case Donna Marianna was the American vessel Orion,Cameron & Crooke (1992), p.62. which Samuel Macdowall & Co. of Liverpool purchased in 1809. They appointed a man named Vauralst as master, and sent her to Madeira with a cargo of culm. From Madeira she sailed to Pernambuco with a cargo of wine. There she was said to have been sold to a Portuguese merchant by the name of Da Silva.African Institution (1812), Vol. 6-9, pp.167-170. From Pernambuco Donna Marianna sailed to Bahia under the Portuguese flag, carrying a cargo of wine of unspecified origin. From Bahia she sailed Cape Coast, having first taken on board \\"a variety of goods assorted for the Slave Trade\\". For this voyage she was under the command of Captain DaSouza,African Institution (1812), Vol. 6-9, p.72. though Vauralst continued on board as supercargo. On 22 May 1809 Crocodile seized Donna Marianna for breach of the Act for the abolition of the slave trade and sent her into Sierra Leone. The Vice admiralty court at Sierra Leone condemned vessel and cargo on 6 July 1810, though there is no evidence that there were any slaves aboard her. Key evidence was the documents found in a passenger's trunk that showed that her fitting out for the slave trade had taken place at Liverpool.Grindal (2016), Kindle loc. ‚Ññ2948. Judgement on appeal The owners appealed, arguing that Donna Marianna was a Portuguese vessel and that therefore she and her cargo were not subject to British Law. Judge William Scott presided over the appeal. On 3 June 1812 he ruled upholding the seizure of Donna Marianna on the grounds that she was a \\"British vessel, and that this Portuguese disguise has been assumed for the mere purpose of protecting the property of British merchants in a traffic which it was not lawful for them to engage in.\\" On 6 June 1812 Scott upheld the seizure of the cargo. He stated, \\"I consider the whole interest of the adventure to reside in the British merchants, and that De Silva is lending his name and agency to further a deception on British laws. I therefore see no reason the cargo should not follow the fate of the ship, with which it is involved in one common fraud.\\" The captors' reward In November 1814, the captain and crew Crocodile received a moiety of the proceeds of the seizure. A first-class share of the distribution, that of Crocodiles captain, was worth ¬£443 17s 0d; a seaman's share was worth ¬£1 15s 9d.

Centered on the town green at the meeting point of Brown's Trace, Varney Road, and Bolger Hill Road, the center (not to be confused with the incorporated village of Jericho) is a well-preserved Vermont country village developed mainly in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The town of Jericho was chartered in 1763, but was not settled until after American independence. The town green which forms the centerpiece of the Jericho Center village was laid out on land donated by early settler Lewis Chapin, on the condition that the town meetinghouse be built there. The village soon grew with the construction of a store and other buildings. The village did not develop as an economic center, lacking water power, and later also railroad connections, but remained viable as a service and civic center for the surrounding rural area. It also benefited from the presence of the Jericho Academy, which provided secondary school from 1825 into the 20th century, and whose surviving building now houses the town library. with The historic district covers , and includes the roughly square town green and all of the buildings facing it. It extends a short way north along Brown's Trace. Most of the buildings are houses between one and 2-1/2 stories in height, in generally vernacular interpretations of architectural styles popular between 1800 and 1920. The Congregational Church is the only brick building; built in 1836 and restyled in 1877, it is a prominent local landmark and a fine example of Federal architecture with Italianate alterations.

() is a 1963 Soviet comedy film directed by Yevgeny Tashkov. The film was watched by 15,4 million viewers. The picture tells about the fate of a simple, talented girl Frosya, who came to study in Moscow from a small Siberian village, about how she has achieved success in the conservatory. Plot Young woman Frosya Burlakova comes to Moscow from a remote Siberian village to enter the Gnessin State Musical College and become a singer. She stays at the place of sculptor Nikolai Vasilievich, who studied at a school in Zaporozhye, where their common acquaintance worked a school manager, who then moved to Siberia. Absolutely unfamiliar with the big city life, Frosya amuses Nikolai Vasilyevich, his girlfriend Natasha and the housekeeper with her provinciality and spontaneity. However, the absolute sincerity and spiritual purity of Frosya lead the sculptor to the idea that he himself has long been bogged down in lies, fuss and commercial work, exchanged his artistic talent for trifles and lost his creative path. Frosya tries to enter the institute, but finds out that she was late the exams are already over. After spending several days at the institute, Frosya constantly encounters the famous and respected professor Sokolov, who finally agrees to listen to her sing. During the audition the professor discovers that the little-educated Siberian girl has a bright and outstanding singing talent, a fantastically strong voice, is also endowed with an innate intelligence and a sense of beauty. He is trying to persuade the administration that Frosya, should be admitted to the institute as an exception. All this time, Nikolai Vasilyevich in vain tries to find himself in art. The further he goes, the more he is convinced that all his previous work is just a forgery for art, and that the ideas are dead and empty. Kostya communication with Frosya, as well as criticism of friends and colleagues only confirm these thoughts. On one of the sleepless nights, realizing that a creative crisis has come, the sculptor, in despair, destroys all creations in his workshop, leaving only one a work from college made during the third year, which he said was really made for people. The next morning Frosya leaves the apartment of Nikolai Vasilyevich. By the efforts of Professor Sokolov, she still manages to be admitted to college and gets a place in the hostel. On the way there she meets a student, Kostya, who soon becomes her boyfriend. However, the relationship between young people does not mesh, because Kostya completely does not share nor understand Frosya's passion for music. And the girl herself when conversing with him does not try to understand his interests, but instead only continues to think about her studies. Six months pass. During one of the lessons Burlakova's voice breaks and she has to interrupt the training for some time. In a tram she accidentally meets Nikolai Vasilyevich. Both are very pleased with each other and in conversation Frosya finds out that the sculptor has changed a lot during this time, has rethought a lot about his life and seems to have found his own creative path. After recovering, Burlakova returns to the institute and on the same day Kostya leaves Moscow for good. He informed Frosya about this using a note and the girl did not even have a chance to say goodbye to him and to get from him any explanation. Left alone, the future singer devotes herself entirely to study, because for her the time of easy success has passed and ahead long and painstaking work is planned.

(The Latin word strix can mean \\"screech-owl\\" or \\"witch\\". See \\"strix\\" in Wiktionary. ) During the early modern period strixologists refuted the reality of witches and contributed to the decline of witch-hunts. As a systematic study, strixology emerged during the period 1431‚Äì1439 at the Council of Basel - an ecclesiastical council where theologians and demonologists met and debated what was seen as the Devil's work, magical observations and confessions of witches. Those issues were not a primary purpose of the Council. Nonetheless, the subject of one of the discussions was a peasant named Stedelen who was believed to have committed maleficia and who said under torture that he was a part of a secret society of Devil- worshippers. This story was disturbing enough to be reported to the council by Peter of Simmental and described in great detail. This case and similar revelations were later used by the Dominican professor Johannes Nider, a participant at the Council's meetings, as examples in his Formicarius (1436-1438) a book that laid the foundations of strixology. Scholars cited this significant work for centuries. Around the time Formicarius was published, there was a relatively small number of witch-hunt victims - estimated to have been in the hundreds. This changed at the end of the 15th century, partially due to the publication of the infamous Malleus Maleficarum which cemented belief in the reality of witches and in the higher susceptibility of women to take part in witchcraft. The book proclaimed that ‚Äúevils which are performed by witches exceed all other sin which God has ever permitted to be done.‚Ä¶‚Äù. The Malleus Maleficarum adamantly pushed its views on the threat of witches in society. The text boldly claims that \\"[witches] exist\\" and \\"to defend the opposite view steadfastly is altogether heretical\\"  References =NotesCitationsBibliography * * Category:Demonology Category:Witchcraft ","title":"Strixology"},{"id":"52097954","text":"Robert Beattie is an American 21st century lawyer and author.

In the essay, Panofsky \\"seeks to describe the visual symptoms endemic\\" to the medium of film. Originally given as an informal talk in 1934 to a group of Princeton University students in the process of founding the film archive of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the essay was subsequently published in revised and expanded form in 1936, 1937, and 1947, and has been widely anthologized ever since. The essay was collected with \\"What Is Baroque?\\" and \\"The Ideological Antecedents of the Rolls-Royce Radiator\\" in the 1995 collection Three Essays on Style.  Summary  Panofsky begins his essay by identifying two features that distinguish ‚Äúfilm art‚Äù (see : art cinema) from preceding forms of art: first, film art was the only art whose beginnings were witnessed by people alive at the time of the essay‚Äôs composition (1934); second, whereas preceding arts were formed by ‚Äúan artistic urge that gave rise to the discovery and gradual perfection of a new technique,‚Äù film was, alternatively, a ‚Äútechnical invention that gave rise to the discovery and gradual perfection of a new art.‚Äù Panofsky then establishes two ‚Äúfundamental facts‚Äù about film: first, that the ‚Äúprimordial‚Äù appeal of films lay not in viewers‚Äô interest in their subject matter or formal presentation of subject matter, but in their ‚Äúsheer delight‚Äù of seeing moving things; second, that the film medium derived from folk art. Panofsky asserts that along with architecture, animation, and commercial design, film is one of the few visual arts that is ‚Äúentirely alive,‚Äù and that it has ‚Äúreestablished‚Äù a ‚Äúdynamic contact between art production and art consumption‚Äù lacking in most other artistic fields. Insisting that film originally drew its form in nineteenth-century painting, postcards, waxworks, comic strips, and its subject matter from popular songs, pulp magazines, and dime novels, Panofsky argues that the film medium originally ‚Äúappealed directly and very intensely to a folk art mentality‚Äù by satiating its appetite for ‚Äújustice and decorum,‚Äù violence, crude humor, and pornography. Despite failed attempts to legitimate the medium by importing literary values and theatrical techniques between 1905 and 1911, film art was, according to Panofsky, developed ‚Äúby the exploitation of the unique and specific possibilities of the new medium‚Äù: the ‚Äúdynamization of space‚Äù and the ‚Äúspatialization of time.\\" According to Panofsky, these qualities distinguished film from theater, as did the ‚Äúprinciple of coexpressibility‚Äù which, during the sound era, entails the integration of the dialogue with the facial expressions of the actors framed in close-up shots. Panofsky goes on to argue that the films produced between 1900 and 1910 established the subject matter and methods of the movies up to the essay‚Äôs publication. After illustrating his argument by discussing various examples from Hollywood cinema, Panofsky concludes by insisting that the requirement of communicability makes the commercial art of cinema more ‚Äúvital‚Äù and ‚Äúeffective‚Äù than noncommercial art. Panofsky ultimately asserts that the cinema‚Äôs unique ‚Äúproblem is to manipulate and shoot unstylized reality in such a way that the result has style.\\" References Category:1936 essays ","title":"Style and Medium in the Motion Pictures"},{"id":"52098003","text":"Edward Roy Scott was a Scottish amateur football forward who made over 150 appearances in the Scottish League for Queen's Park.

Originally advertised as \\"educational drama\\" or \\"educational subject,\\" it grapples with the theme of immigration, assimilation, and of becoming a \\"good American.\\" The film carries an explicit feminist message: the lopsided power dynamics in an immigrant couple becomes increasingly equalized, as the couple spends more time in America. The wife learns to stand up to her husband's abuses, while the husband is repeatedly coerced by other American citizens into treating his wife as his equal, until he is able to internalize the ethos of the Progressive Era. The film works to allay anxieties over Eastern European immigrant men bringing \\"Old World\\" patriarchal values and practices to the \\"New World.\\"  Plot  Ivan Orloff (Lee Beggs) and his unnamed wife (Blanche Cornwall) are poor peasants, presumably living in the Russian Empire. Ivan is shown sitting on a cart while his wife walks alongside their horse, helping to pull the cart. The husband whips both the horse and his wife indiscriminately. The wife is represented as completely subordinated, as just another beast. On their way, they meet a group of emigrants who invite Ivan to join them. When Ivan, together with his wife, arrives in America, \\"the land of freedom,\\" he learns four \\"lesson[s] in Americanism\\" that turn him into a respectful husband with regard to his wife. The first lesson takes place upon landing. Ivan has his wife carry a huge bundle on her back. When she succumbs under the weight of the bundle, Ivan starts prodding her with a stick, threatening to beat her. A gentleman approaches them, picks up the bundle and puts it on Ivan's back. The gentleman takes the stick from Ivan, hands it to the wife and shows her how to prod Ivan. The second \\"lesson in Americanism\\" takes place in the couple's new home at Odessa Inn. Threatening his wife, Ivan asks her to take off his shoes. He beats her and knocks her to the floor. A man comes in and asks Ivan to put the wife in bed. After Ivan reluctantly does that, the man knocks him down to the floor the way Ivan did to his wife. The third lesson takes place in the countryside. The couple no longer lives at the inn but owns a house and some land. The wife no longer wears a scarf. She toils in the garden, while Ivan sits in a chair smoking a pipe. When she protests, Ivan goes to beat her, but a passer-by stops him and punches him several times, forcing him to tend to his wife who has fainted and work instead of her. Ivan's wife begins to live in an increasingly \\"American way.\\" She learns to stand up to his abuse. They have another feud, this time while having dinner in their house. While they are scuffling with each other, two men come in and break them up. For Ivan's fourth and final \\"lesson in Americanism,\\" he gets sentenced to hard labor for six months. In prison, he cracks and becomes \\"completely Americanized.\\" The ending shows Ivan in the garden and his wife calling him for dinner. As they sit down to the table, they both seem happy and equal.

The beck is fed from local streams in Scalby, Newby and Burniston and other watercourses draining off the nearby hills. It is also a bypass channel for the upper reaches of the River Derwent when it is under flood conditions. History The Sea Cut is fed by small streams and becks mainly draining water away from the hills on the western side of Scalby and Newby. In response to major flooding on the River Derwent in 1799, a canalised beck was cut between Everley and Newby Bridge (the present day A171 road bridge that spans the beck between Newby and Scalby). The Sea Cut was primarily to stop flooding in West and East Ayton further downstream. This means that water flowing in the River Derwent takes before reaching the sea via the Humber Estuary as opposed to the relatively short distance via the Sea Cut. This scheme, along with others in the area (straightening of the Derwent and Hertford rivers and land drainage) was promoted by Sir George Cayley and William Chapman with Robert Wilson employed as engineer for the Sea Cut navigation. During the Ice Age, the water flowed to the sea along the course of the Sea Cut before glacial mud build up caused what is now the Derwent river to change course and lead to it flowing westwards away from the North Sea. The Sea Cut (or New Cut) was opened on 3 September 1804 and extended to with a width of and a drop of . Ten weirs were built along its length to control the energy of the floodwaters with the weir head at Everley controlling the flow of the Sea Cut by use of a sluice gate allowing floodwater over the weir when the Derwent is in spate, but maintaining the flow of water in the Derwent when dryer conditions prevail. The sluice gate at Everely is designed specifically to not allow floodwater to enter the Derwent. Instead the majority of the floodwater is diverted down the Sea Cut. Local businessmen, entrepreneurs and farmers all gathered together to make the scheme viable as it would also provide additional land for agriculture. A new bridge was built for Mowthorp Road as part of the scheme (which is now Grade II listed) with the other crossing points in Scalby having had many bridges throughout human history, although they were all replaced in the latter part of the 19th or the early part of the 20th century (Newby Bridge was washed away in a flood in August 1890. Whitby Road Bridge (the A165 road) was rebuilt in 1906). The beck's outfall into the North Sea was further south than where it is now. Adjacent to the Sea Life Centre at Scarborough was a coastal island known as Monkey Island. This was large enough to play cricket and football on top of it and the Sea Cut used to run between the coast and Monkey Island and enter the sea further south on the coast towards Peasholm. Monkey Island was lost to coastal erosion and the remains were finally removed after its location became part of the Scarborough Sea Life Centre. Route Composite 1954 map showing the course of the Sea Cut (1:25,000)The watercourse starts in the parish of Suffield-cum-Everley near to Mowthorpe Farm. This is where the River Derwent turns south away from the coast. The Sea Cut runs for due eastwards flowing over three weirs on the way in a fairly straight sided channel as this is the cut section. It flows under Mowthorp Road (C71) and then flows north eastwards before reaching the Hackness Road (C251). This is where the canalised section ends and the last is known as Scalby Beck. Traditionally, where Church Beck joins the main watercourse, it was known as Scalby Beck. The beck flows on underneath the A171 road at Newby Bridge; hereafter it is more of a meander as this is the natural course of water before the new cut further upstream was added. The beck then flows under the viaduct of the former Scarborough to Whitby Railway and the A165 road before flowing through a deep channel in heathland at Scalby Ness then flowing out into the North Sea by Scalby Mills and Scarborough Sea Life Centre. The last section had the watermills and still has the lionshare of weirs (7) from a total of ten weirs on the entire watercourse. Control of floodwaters and flood prevention is the responsibility of the Environment Agency as the Sea Cut is designated as a main river alongside the Derwent, the Hertford and the Esk rivers. The becks that flow into the Sea Cut and Scalby Beck are maintained by Scarborough Borough Council. Industrial history The Sea Cut and its banks were used to support all manner of industries. Chief amongst these were the four mills that lined the beck, two of which are still extant; one, a former 17th century watermill, which is now a Youth Hostel on the A165 road and the Low Mill at Scalby Mills which is a public house having been converted from a mill by 1854. High Mill, and its associated buildings, still exist as High Mill Farm and are Grade II listed. The history of milling on this site goes back to 1609 (though the current building were built in the 1840s). High Mill made good use of the increased water flow on Scalby Beck by building a mill race to power its waterwheel. The mill race has since been filled in with earth. The corn mill that operated as Newby Bridge was opened in the mid 18th century and had closed by the 1950s. It received its corn via the railway at Scalby railway station. This mill was adjacent to the A165 bridge further downstream from Newby, but was known as Newby Bridge Mill. Coastal surveys have identified a Smallpox isolation hospital and a rifle range in the lower reaches of the beck. The rifle range was used in the First and Second World Wars. Ecology When the Sea Cut was drained for repairs in 2014, a colony of 100 Crayfish were removed for safety and then returned to the beck when the remediation works had taken place. Many obstacles prevent fish from migrating up the beck (notably the weirs) and steps have been taken to alleviate this problem. In autumn 2012, a special fish pass was installed on the weir adjacent to the Burniston Road Bridge (the A165). Scalby Beck Angling Club spent ¬£9,000 on the wooden structure which is the same as another successful fish pass installed further up the beck. Another barrier to fish migration is the weir at the mouth of the beck. There is a concrete pipe which was originally built to carry sewage and deposit it onto the beach further north. Apart from high tide, fish migration is very difficult here. Scalby Beck provides the only substantial sea trout spawning area between the River Esk at Whitby and the Humber Estuary. Otters have been recorded on the beck, too. The lower reaches of the beck have been notified as a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). Access In the upper reaches of the Cut, when it makes its way across the flat terrain west of Scalby, the Cut can be accessed by paths and bridleways on both the northern and southern banks. The Tabular Hills Walk runs along the southern bank from the A171 Road bridge to Mowthorpe Farm on Mowthorp Road. The walk stretches for from Scalby Mills to Helmsley. The lower reaches of the Cut from the A171 Road to the mouth are steeper and access is controlled by Scalby Beck Angling Club. The mouth of the beck is accessible via a footbridge that carries the Cleveland Way. The mouth is also adjacent to Scalby Mills and Scarborough Sea Life Centre, so access is easy there too.

It is only known from four locations in south-east Queensland.flower buds Description Eucalyptus beaniana is a tree that grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has hard black \\"ironbark\\" on its trunk and larger branches. Branches thinner than about have smooth, brownish white bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are arranged alternately, linear, long and wide on a short petiole. Adult leaves are the same dull green to bluish colour on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in group of seven, mostly on the ends of the branches. The groups are on a branched peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. Mature buds are club-shaped to spindle- shaped or more or less cylindrical, long and wide. The operculum is about as long as, or slightly shorter than the floral cup and blunt conical to rounded. Flowering has been recorded in September and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to conical capsule long, wide on a pedicel long with the valves level or slightly protruding. Eucalyptus beaniana is closely related to E. taurina, but can be distinguished by the linear juvenile leaves and by larger amount of smooth bark on the branches. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus beaniana was first formally described by Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson in 1991 in the journal Telopea from samples collected near the Isla Gorge lookout carpark by Johnson and Anthony Russell Bean in 1984. The specific epithet (beaniana) honours Anthony Bean. Distribution and habitat Bean's ironbark is found growing in shallow and sandy soils as part of woodland communities along with numerous other eucalypt species, on quartzose and sandstone ridges. It is known from only four locations in south-east Queensland, in the Isla Gorge National Park, near Taroom, Cracow and Mundubbera.

The company, based in Warwick, was started when a Ben Tilton and a Captain Philips trading as Avon Coachworks went into business in 1919 to make bodywork for cars. Following a change of ownership and financial reconstruction it became New Avon in 1922.A-Z of British Coachbuilders. Nick Walker. Bay View Books 1997. 1929 Lea Francis O-type 1928 Austin Seven sportsman's two seater 1930 Standard Sixteen Swan coup√© For the first few years their main customer was Lea-Francis but they also made coachwork for Hampton cars. In 1927 they produced an open two seat body for the Austin 7, followed in 1928 by a fixed head coup√©, which went by the name of Swan, and then in 1929 a \\"sportsman's two seater\\" appeared. The Swan was the work of Alan Jensen, who had joined the company and would with his brother create Jensen Brothers, which later became Jensen Motors. Alan had come to the attention of New Avon when at the encouragement of Alfred Herbert Wilde (1891-1930), chief engineer of the Standard Motor Company, the brothers brought a new design for a body on a Standard 9 chassis which they wanted New Avon to put into production. This work came just in time as the Lea-Francis work stopped in 1931 when that company went into receivership. 1931 Standard Big Nine Special two-seater Sports For most of the 1930s work on Standard chassis dominated the output with Swan coup√©s and Wayfarer saloons but in 1930 they also exhibited a coup√© body on a Wolseley Hornet and took their own stand at the 1931 London Motor Show. Alan Jensen left the company in 1930 and was replaced by Charles F. Beauvais, who had started the Bow-V-Car light car company. Beauvais produced more designs for Standard as well as work for Austin, Lanchester and Crossley Motors, which he would go on to join in 1933 as chief designer. He was replaced at New Avon by Arthur Meredith who had been working as foreman of the experimental bodyshop. Production peaked in 1933-35 with 30-40 cars a week being made by a workforce of around 80 in the three storey building in Wharf Street. 1936 Standard Sixteen Wayfarer drophead coup√© In 1935 the company was bought by John Maudslay, son of the founder of Standard, Reginald Maudslay, and became part of the Maudslay Motor Group. A showroom in London's Mayfair was opened and at the London Olympia Show five cars were exhibited. A move was made to new premises at Ladbroke House in Millers road. In 1937 there was a downturn in the company fortunes and New Avon was unable to pay their bill to Standard who foreclosed and forced bankruptcy. A new company trading as Avon Bodies Ltd took over the business moving to smaller premises at The Cape and managed to fit the existing stock of bodies onto Triumph Dolomite chassis. Lea-Francis was now back in business and the old ties were re-established with Avon supplying the Waymaker saloon bodies for their two litre model. During World War II Avon was occupied rebuilding aircraft and with peace tried to go back to car body making. That market had largely disappeared for good, but they were kept occupied by repair work and some conversions including hearses. In 1973 Avon was sold to Graham Hudson who ran a large Midlands based car sales and repair organisation. In 1978 Ladbroke Avon Ltd incorporating Avon Special Products was formed. They made some special bodied Land Rovers and the Avon-Stevens XJC convertibles designed by Anthony Stevens. In 1980 these were joined by the Stevens designed Jaguar XJ6 estate car which won the gold medal for coachbuilding at the 1980 Motor Show. Wanting to reach a larger market a conversion of the Triumph Acclaim was produced in 1981 followed by a turbo version. The business, without the rights to use the Avon name, was finally sold in 1985.

The beauty of the island was only seen by media after the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan in the province. Mararison is just behind the world's most popular beach destination, Boracay. Mararison or Malalison means the one who is fond of violating or the one who refuses to follow rules. Legend According to a popular local legend, the island was one of the three offspring of Madya-as and Kanlaon namely: Mararison, Batbatan and Maningning. Mararison and Batbatan turned out to be strong men while Maningning was the prettiest in Antique. However, the siblings grew up to be stubborn as well. Mararison was fond of violating rules, Batbatan was disobeying his parents and the elders, while Maningningso some people know its real or not. Because of this, Bulalakaw, the chief god, saw it all and made an action to teach the siblings a lesson. Then there came a very strong typhoon. The wind and the sea became ecstatic by rage. Flashes of lightning and thunder occurred as the weather grew terrible. Bulalakaw gathered the siblings. By one wave of his hand, he threw them in the sea and turned them into islands and separated them in mainland Antique one by one despite Madya-as' and Kanlaon's appeal and prayers to the chief god. Mararison being the nearest (as he received the lightest punishment because he is first-born and greatly loved by his parents and later realized his mistakes but was too late), Maningning (present day Maniguin Island) as the farthest and Batbatan in between the two. They were cursed to be separated to their parents in eternity.

He and his brother attended the local public schools. Anderson then attended the College of William and Mary, graduating in 1940. He then held various sales jobs during the next two years, and married his wife Mildred Webb in 1941. They had three sons who survived them, Howard P., John W. and David T. Anderson. In 1942, during World War II, Anderson enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, he served as a communications officer aboard ships in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. After the war ended, Anderson attended the University of Richmond Law School, and graduated in 1948. Career Anderson became an FBI agent, and then established his own legal practice in Halifax county in 1950. He was active in the bar association, as well as Halifax School Board, and with the Ruritan Club, Masons, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars and Virginia Farm Bureau. Beginning in 1958, during the Massive Resistance crisis, Anderson served in the Virginia House of Delegates, representing Halifax County and South Boston, Virginia from 1958 until 1972. He succeeded Roy B. Davis. Anderson won the 35th District seat unopposed in 1957, 1959 and 1961, handily defeated Republicans Flournoy G. Lacks in 1963 and Weldon W. Tuck in 1965 in what had become the 34th District, and was again unopposed in 1967 and 1969. In 1971, Anderson won election to the Virginia Senate, succeeding Byrd Democrat James D. Hagood in the 18th Senatorial district, comprising not only Halifax County, but also Appomattox, Buckingham, Lunenburg and Prince Edward counties and part of Campbell County, as well as the city of South Boston. Voters re-elected Anderson to the Virginia Senate several times before he announced his upcoming retirement in 1991.The General Assembly of Virginia, 1982-1995 (Richmond, 1995), p. 140 However, district boundaries changed significantly, such that he was succeeded by fellow Democrat Louise Lucas of Portsmouth who defeated Republican Frank L. Ruff Jr. in the general election to become the first African American female senator in Virginia. Anderson also helped pass a Uranium mining moratorium in the Virginia General Assembly halting plans to excavate over 100 million pounds of uranium in Pittsylvania County. This moratorium still stands today, and is the bulwark of the anti- mining resistance within the state of Virginia. Death and legacy Anderson died in 2000, survived by his three sons. He is buried at the Baptist cemetery in Halifax, and a local street is named after him.

Approaches that involve critical mathematics pedagogy give special attention to the social, political, cultural and economic contexts of oppression, as they can be understood through mathematics. They also analyze the role that mathematics plays in producing and maintaining potentially oppressive social, political, cultural or economic structures. Finally, critical mathematics pedagogy demands that critique is connected to action promoting more just and equitable social, political or economic reform. Critical mathematics pedagogy builds on critical theory developed in the post-Marxist Frankfurt School, as well as critical pedagogy developed out of critical theory by Brazilian educator and educational theorist Paulo Freire. Definitions of critical mathematics pedagogy and critical mathematics education differ among those who practice it and write about it in their work. The focus of critical mathematics pedagogy shifts between three core tenets, but always includes some attention to all three: (1) analysis of injustice and inequitable relations of power made possible through mathematics, (2) critiques of the ways in which mathematics is used to structure and maintain power, and (3) critiques toward plans of action for change and the use of mathematics to reveal and oppose injustices, as well as imagine proposals for more equitable and just relations. Core concepts and foundations=Critical theory and critical mathematics Those who build their critical mathematics pedagogy with close relations to critical theory, focus on the analysis of mathematics as having \\"formatting power\\" that shapes the way we understand and organize the world. The assumption underlying critical mathematics pedagogy that comes from critical theory is the notion that mathematics is not neutral. According to critical mathematics, neither mathematics itself nor the teaching or learning of mathematics can be value-neutral, or free of interpretation. The critical mathematics group (est. 1990), one of the first groups of teachers and researchers to convene around the work of critical mathematics, state that mathematics is (1) knowledge constructed by humans, (2) the set of knowledges constructed by all groups of humans, not only the Eurocentric knowledge traditionally included in academic texts and (3) a human enterprise in which understanding results from action in social, cultural, political and economic context. Marilyn Frankenstein, the first educator to coin the term critical mathematics pedagogy in the United States in her 1983 article \\"Critical Mathematics Pedagogy: An Application of Paulo Freire's Epistemology,\\" illustrates one way in which mathematics is not neutral using the example of the world map. She explains that in order to represent a three-dimensional object on a two dimensional surface, such as is necessary when mapping the earth, map-makers must make decisions about which types of distortions to allow. For example, the most traditionally accepted and commonly used world map is the Mercator map which enlarges the size of Europe and shrinks the size of Africa - a side-effect of the way it works (to assist navigation). This representation can be read to suggest that certain parts of the world are larger, and therefore more important or more powerful than others via the (inaccurate) size comparison presented in the map. Ole Skovsmose's first publication on critical mathematics pedagogy in Europe coincided with Marilyn Frankenstein's in the United States. It refers to \\"mathemacy\\" which would parallel critical literacy for mathematics. He explains that \\"mathematics colonizes part of reality and reorders it.\\" Therefore, \\"the goal of mathematics education should be to understand the formatting power of mathematics and to empower people to examine this formatting power so they will not be controlled by it.\\" According to him, mathemacy would consist of three components (1) mathematical knowing, or the skills developed in traditional mathematics classrooms, (2) technological knowing, or the ability to build models with mathematics and (3) reflective knowing, or competency in evaluating applications of mathematics. It is specifically the third component that makes this approach to mathematical literacy a critical one. B√ºlent Avcƒ±, through a classroom-based participatory action research, in his recent book, Critical Mathematics Education: Can Democratic Education Survive under Neoliberal Regime?, re-conceptualizes Critical Mathematics Education as a bottom-up response to the top-down imposed market-driven implementations and neoliberal hegemony in education. In this context, B√ºlent Avcƒ± offers rich ethnographic data to redefine concepts such as dialogic pedagogy, collaborative learning, and inquiry-based mathematics education in order to promote justice-based critical citizenship and participatory democracy. In that he distinguishes these concepts from neoliberal pedagogy. B√ºlent Avcƒ± simultaneously draws on the ideas of Paulo Freire and Jurgen Habermas to develop a unique approach to Critical Mathematics Education. Critical pedagogy and critical mathematics pedagogy Those who build their critical mathematics pedagogy out of critical pedagogy focus on empowerment of the learners as experts and actors for change in their own world. Critical mathematics pedagogy demands that students and teachers use mathematics to understand \\"relations of power, resource inequalities between different social groups and explicit discrimination\\" in order to take action for change. Paolo Freire (1921‚Äì1997), Brazilian educator and educational theorist, commonly regarded as the originator of critical pedagogy, suggests that most teaching happens in a \\"banking\\" model where teachers hold the information and students are assumed to be passive receptacles for that knowledge. Freire's alternative to the banking method is a \\"problem-posing\\" model of education. Through this model students and teachers participate together in a mutually humanizing process of dialogue. With the support of their teacher, students examine problems from their own lives and work collaboratively to generate solutions. One goal of critical pedagogy, according to Freire, is to develop critical consciousness or conscientiza√ß√£o (Portuguese). Both teachers and students are expected to challenge their own \\"well-established ways of thinking that frequently limit their own potential\\" and that of others. They are especially expected to challenge those ways of thinking that might reproduce instead of challenge oppressive ways of thinking and being. This commitment to learning and critique for the purpose of action for change is also known as praxis, the intersection of theory and practice, another core tenet of the critical pedagogy of Paulo Freire. Marilyn Frankenstien argues that \\"most current uses of mathematics support hegemonic ideologies.\\" In particular, she focuses on the mathematical science of statistics which supports the unquestioned acceptance of uncertain conclusions. She argues that the use of the banking model in mathematics education (memorization and procedural focus) produces \\"math anxiety\\" in many people, especially and disproportionately those in non- dominant groups (women, people of color, lower income students). This math anxiety then leads people to \\"not probe the mathematical mystifications\\" that drive industrial society. Eric (Rico) Gutstein applies Freire's notion of the inherent connection between \\"reading the word and the world\\" to mathematical literacy. He suggests that teaching mathematics for social justice involves both reading the world with mathematics, or more explicitly, \\"using mathematics to understand relations of power, resource inequalities between different social groups and explicit discrimination,\\" as well as writing the world with mathematics, or developing the tools of social agency in young people for acting in their own worlds. Mathematical literacy according to Gutstein must include both the capacity to \\"read the mathematical world,\\" necessary for traditional academic and economic success, as well as the capacity to \\"read the world with mathematics,\\" meaning the use of mathematics to understand and interrogate potentially problematic or unjust structures in their own lives. Critical mathematics pedagogy in action Because critical mathematics pedagogy is designed to be responsive to the lives of the students in a given classroom and their local context, there is no set curriculum. Some educators re-use lessons or units from year to year that may apply to multiple groups of students, while other educators develop projects that respond directly to the concerns of a particular group of students, building a project together around a problem the students have posed. Precisely for this reason it is pertinent to consider a few examples of what critical mathematics pedagogy might look like in action. William Tate, critical race theorist and promoter of culturally relevant teaching, describes the work of one teacher who brought together many of the core components of critical mathematics pedagogy. This teacher elicited concerns from her students about their own neighborhood and lives, and found out that one concern was the prevalence of liquor stores in the neighborhood. Students were being harassed on their way to and from school, having to step over or walk past drunk individuals, making them feel uncomfortable and unsafe. This teacher led her students through the process of in-depth research to better understand the distribution of liquor licenses and the reasons behind the concentration in their neighborhood. The class then met with local journalists to discuss the use of different types of graphic for representing statistics to the general public. The class then considered and determined which graphics and statistical representations (decimals, fractions, percents) might be the strongest for communicating their findings. Finally, the students used their research to produce a policy solution which they presented to the local community council. The work of this group of students and their teacher succeeded in leading to the closing of two of the nearby liquor stores in the neighborhood. Ole Skovsmose describes a classroom in Denmark in which students learned about the use of algorithms for distribution of welfare support to families by attempting to create their own algorithms. The class worked in groups, where each group came up with a family profile to serve under the supervision of the instructor. Groups then were given a budget for welfare distributions to families and had to come up with how to distribute the money among all the families in their \\"town\\" made up of all the created family profiles. The task led them to develop ways of categorizing people in families by age, and families type, by income amount and type, by labor and employment, by possible productivity to society, and more. Some groups distributed the money without building a distribution algorithm, using trial and error and attempting to balance the distribution by more intuitive means. Others built algorithms, working backwards, attempting to break down the distribution using percentages. Many groups were surprised to find that their algorithms did not function comprehensively, and did not fully distribute the amount they were budgeted, and that the outcomes by group were vastly different. Perhaps more importantly, students gained an awareness of the choices and decision making that goes into how policies such as welfare for families are complex and human-created, not simply existing structures. This project is an example of the way in which critical mathematics pedagogy can reveal the role that humans play in mathematizing the world. It is different from Tate's example because it does not explicitly include an action component. Shelly M. Jones teaches Mathematics Education at Central Connecticut State University. Her classes address culturally relevant mathematics, where she explains cognitively demanding mathematics skills from a relevant cultural perspective. For a collection of sample lessons that address mathematics teaching through a critical lens see the book, Rethinking Mathematics: Teaching Social Justice by the Numbers (Eds. Gutstein and Peterson, 2005). Related concepts Other work in the field of mathematics education that often overlaps at least in part with critical mathematics pedagogy includes the work of ethnomathematics, culturally relevant teaching in mathematics, and work for educational equity in mathematics. The concept of ethnomathematics was introduced by D'Ambrosio in 1978, in response to the reliance on Eurocentric models for academic mathematics teaching to the exclusion of other cultural models. The goal of work in ethnomathematics is to de-center mathematics as a European dominated discipline by contributing research and teaching that highlights the contributions of many different cultures to mathematics as a discipline, and validating a wide range of mathematical practices. Ethnomathematics work notices, recognizes, reclaims, and celebrates the ways in which non-European communities and cultures are now and have throughout their histories been creating, using, and innovating with mathematics. It differs from critical mathematics pedagogy in that its focus is on cultural and social aspects of mathematics, where critical mathematics work also includes an explicit focus on politics and power structures. Though differences exist, those who work in either field oftentimes publish in similar publications and both consider their work mathematics for social justice. Culturally relevant teaching in mathematics was developed initially to support the success of African-American students, frequently poorly served by the American public school system which has a long history of educational inequality. The liquor store example provided above is shared by Tate as an example of culturally relevant teaching, but might likewise be seen to embody the tenets of critical pedagogy. He cites six core practices of the teacher from the example that make her work culturally relevant: (1) communication between students, teacher, and outside entities, (2) cooperative group work, (3) investigative research throughout the learning process, (4) questioning content, people, and institutions, (5) open-ended problem solving connected to student realities, and (6) social action. While the practices listed by Tate resonate profoundly with those of critical mathematics pedagogy, the difference (if there is any) is in the goals of the two approaches. The focus of culturally relevant teaching is on the empowerment and liberation of a cultural or racial group, whereas the goals of critical pedagogy include empowerment and liberation of individuals as well as groups, in the face of any form of oppression, not only cultural or racial oppression. The notion of educational equity in mathematics education promotes the provision of high quality mathematics education to all groups and individuals in an attempt to narrow achievement gaps, for example gaps related to race and gender. This approach does not include a critical approach to mathematics itself, or the notion that mathematics education should include the learning of mathematics for the purpose of being able to analyze and change structures of power and injustice in the world. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the world's largest mathematics education organization, has placed equity as one of its top priorities. However, critical mathematics educators suggest that the NCTM standards \\"fail to define equity in applicable terms for classroom teachers, and it overemphasized the economic aspects of equity.\\" Challenges and critiques Logistically, implementation of critical pedagogy is a challenge because there is and can be no \\"how-to recipe.\\" If the curriculum must be built out of students‚Äô lives then it will necessarily change each year and with each group of students. Critiques are widespread, suggesting that mathematics is unbiased and not bound to culture, society or politics and therefore should not be wrongly politicized in the classroom. It is argued that this politicization is a distraction from achievement and risks holding students back, most specifically those it purports to support. ReferencesBibliography * Frankenstein, M.

History The mummy genre has its origins in the 19th century when Egypt was being colonized by France and, subsequently, by Victorian Britain. The first living mummies in fiction were mostly female, and they were presented in a romantic and sexual light, often as love interests for the protagonist; this metaphorically represented the sexualized Orientalism and the colonial romanticization of the East. Notable examples of this trend include The Mummy's Foot by Th√©ophile Gautier, The Jewel of Seven Stars by Bram Stoker, The Ring of Thoth by Arthur Conan Doyle, She: A History of Adventure and Smith and the Pharaohs by H. Rider Haggard, My New Year's Eve Among the Mummies by Grant Allen, The Unseen Man's Story by Julian Hawthorne, and Iras: A Mystery by H. D. Everett; the latter actually has the protagonist marry a mummy which takes on the form of a beautiful woman. Starting from the 1930s, the \\"romantic mummy\\" was supplanted by the \\"monster mummy\\", pioneered by Boris Karloff in the 1932 movie The Mummy; mummies thus joined the pantheon of 19th century Gothic monsters, alongside Count Dracula and Frankenstein's monster. However, the end of the 20th century saw the revival of interest in the \\"romantic mummy\\" archetype, starting with the 1989 novel The Mummy, or Ramses the Damned by Anne Rice, which involved a sexual relationship between a benevolent male mummy and a female archaeologist. The trend intensified throughout the late 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s: modern works of fiction featuring romanticized living mummies include the 1997 horror fiction novella Don't Tell Mummy by Tom B. Stone,Don't Tell Mummy recap by Point Horror the Inca Mummy Girl episode of the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the 2006 fantasy novel Freaks: Alive on the Inside by Annette Curtis Klause, and the 2011 video game The Next Big Thing by Pendulo Studios.Blockfort: Top 10 Best Egyptian Video Game Characters!

Let's Be Heroes features the character Ms. Mummy (voiced by Ashly Burch) who is a regular of the Lake Plaza Turbo where she lives behind \\"Gar's Hero Supply & Bodega.\\" Film During the 20th century, horror films and other mass media popularized the notion of a curse associated with mummies (see Curse of the pharaohs). The 1922 discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb by archaeologist Howard Carter brought mummies into the mainstream. * One of the earliest appearances was The Jewel of Seven Stars, a horror novel by Bram Stoker first published in 1903 that concerned an archaeologist's plot to revive an ancient Egyptian mummy. This book later served as the basis for the 1971 film Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, the 1980 film The Awakening and the 1997 direct-to-video film Bram Stoker's Legend of the Mummy. * Films representing such a belief include the 1932 movie The Mummy starring Boris Karloff as Imhotep; four subsequent 1940s' Universal Studios mummy films which featured a mummy named Kharis, and a 1959 Hammer remake of The Mummy's Hand and The Mummy's Tomb, which also featured Kharis. The belief in cursed mummies probably stems in part from the supposed curse on the tomb of Tutankhamun. * In 1979, the American Broadcasting Company aired a TV holiday show, The Halloween That Almost Wasn't, in which a mummy from Egypt (Robert Fitch) arrived at Count Dracula's castle without speaking. * Slapstick comedy trio The Three Stooges humorously exploited the discovery in the short film We Want Our Mummy, in which they explored the tomb of the midget King Rutentuten (and his Queen, Hotsy Totsy). A decade later, they played crooked used chariot salesmen in Mummy's Dummies, in which they ultimately assisted a different King Rootentootin (Vernon Dent) with a toothache. * Comedy duo Abbott and Costello, as part of their series crossing over with the Universal Monsters, encountered a mummy named Klaris (a parody of Kharis) in 1955's Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy. * A Mummy was featured in the film Mad Monster Party?.

Later, his parents are also seen in Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb with the tablet providing similar effects. Unlike in most portrayals of mummies, the magic is so thorough that the mummies are restored to full life-like appearance, as opposed to simple reanimation. * The Hotel Transylvania franchise features Murray the Mummy (voiced by CeeLo Green in the first movie, Keegan-Michael Key in the second movie) as one of the main characters. In addition, there was also a female mummy that made background cameos. * The 2017 film The Mummy features the mummy of Ahmanet (portrayed by Sofia Boutella).

It originated with a project for a memorial to Caribbean Royal Air Force veterans of World War II who arrived in Britain in 1948 on the MV Empire Windrush; this was an extension of the commemorative plaque and sculpture scheme run by the Nubian Jak Community Trust to highlight the historic contributions of Black and minority ethnic people in Britain.Tracey Francis, \\"African and Caribbean War Memorial\\", Keep The Faith, 18 May 2017. The memorial was originally to have been placed at Tilbury Docks, as part of the commemoration for the centenary of the outbreak of World War I. However, as the project began to evolve into a larger tribute that included both World Wars and commemorated servicemen and women from both Africa and the Caribbean, it was agreed by the memorial recipient ‚Äì the Port of Tilbury ‚Äì and the project organisers that a new, more accessible location needed to found.

It contains objects found at sites in the surrounding area, including the tell of K√∂≈ük H√∂y√ºk and the Graeco-Roman city of Tyana, both in the nearby town of Kemerhisar.  History  From the Second World War until 1950, part of the collection of the Istanbul Archaeological Museum was kept in the Akmedrese, the main Quran school in Niƒüde, on Ak Medrese Caddesi. The building continued to be used as a museum after that. Because that space ceased to be sufficient for the collection, work began on a new museum building in 1971. The Akmedrese was closed in 1977and the new museum was opened to visitors on 12 November 1982. Soon the collection outgrew this building as well and it was accordingly rebuilt and renovated. The re-opening of the present museum occurred in 2001. The museum is or has been active in excavations at K√∂≈ük H√∂y√ºk, Porsuk H√ºy√ºk, Kestel, G√∂ll√º Daƒü, Andaval, Eskig√ºm√º≈ü and Kƒ±nƒ±k H√∂y√ºk.Niƒüde - ƒ∞l K√ºlt√ºr ve Turizm M√ºd√ºrl√ºƒü√º .

They come from G√∂ll√º Daƒü, K√∂≈ük H√∂y√ºk, Pƒ±narba≈üƒ± G√∂l√º, , and other locations and date back to the 12th millennium BC. A large number of pottery objects from the sixth and fifth millennia BC are also displayed, most of which come from the excavations at K√∂≈ük H√∂y√ºk. There is also a reconstruction of a house from this settlement. Room 2 constrains objects from the early Bronze Age of the 3rd millennium BC, which is also the time of the Assyrian trade colonies (Karum). The objects come from excavations at Acemh√∂y√ºk, near √áamardƒ±, and in the prehistoric tin mines of Kestel. In Room 2, there are steles and other objects from the Neo-Hittite/Luwian and Phrygian periods. The former are associated with the Hittite cities of the Nahita (Niƒüde) and Tuwanuwa (Kemerhisar) and the Neo-Hittite successor state of Tuwana. A noteworthy object is the Niƒüde Stele which was found near the . It depicts the weather god and was dedicated to Warpalawas, the King of Tuwana in the 8th century BC by his son Muwaharanis.Stele of Niƒüde; John David Hawkins: Corpus of Hieroglyphic Luwian Inscriptions.

There is a plaster cast of the which also mentions Warpalawas and was found reused in the floor of a Byzantine church at Andaval (modern Akta≈ü) to the northeast of Niƒüde. Another stele from this period was found at Ke≈ülik, about 30 km west of Niƒüde, near Altunhisar. It shows the weather god in a similar way to the Stele of Niƒüde, but its inscription is no longer legible.Stele of Ke≈ülik (with bibliography). In addition to these objects there are also Luwian hieroglyphic inscriptions from Porsuk and Veliisa, door lions from G√∂ll√º Daƒü and small objects and pottery from the Phrygian period.

Room 4 contains objects from the Graeco-Roman period, mostly from Tyana. Among these are inscriptions, statues, reliefs, a sarcophagus, small finds, and pottery. At the entrance to Room 5, there is a smaller room with coins from the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Islamic periods. In Room 5 itself, there are the mummies of a woman and four children which were found in the early Christian church of the Ihlara Valley and date to the 10th century AD. Room 6 has an ethnographic display with books, carpets, weapons and traditional costumes.

They have longish bills with hooked tips and webbed feet with sharp claws. They look like large dark gulls, but have a fleshy cere above the upper mandible. They are strong, acrobatic fliers. *Great skua, Stercorarius skua (A) *South polar skua, Stercorarius maccormicki (A) *Pomarine jaeger, Stercorarius pomarinus *Parasitic jaeger, Stercorarius parasiticus *Long-tailed jaeger, Stercorarius longicaudus (A when seen from shore) Auks, murres, and puffins Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Alcidae Alcids are superficially similar to penguins in their black-and-white colors, their upright posture, and some of their habits. However they are only distantly related to the penguins and are able to fly. Auks live on the open sea, deliberately coming ashore only to nest. *Dovekie, Alle alle *Common murre, Uria aalge (A when seen from shore) *Thick-billed murre, Uria lomvia (A) *Razorbill, Alca torda *Black guillemot, Cepphus grylle (A) *Atlantic puffin, Fratercula arctica (A when seen from shore) Gulls, terns, and skimmers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds and includes gulls, terns, and skimmers. Gulls are typically gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish. *Black-legged kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla *Sabine's gull, Xema sabini (A) *Bonaparte's gull, Chroicocephalus philadelphia *Black- headed gull, Chroicocephalus ridibundus *Little gull, Hydrocoloeus minutus *Ross's gull, Rhodostethia rosea (A) *Laughing gull, Leucophaeus atricilla *Franklin's gull, Leucophaeus pipixcan (A) *Mew gull, Larus canus (A) *Ring- billed gull, Larus delawarensis *California gull, Larus californicus (A) *Herring gull, Larus argentatus *Iceland gull, Larus glaucoides *Lesser black- backed gull, Larus fuscus *Glaucous gull, Larus hyperboreus *Great black- backed gull, Larus marinus *Kelp gull, Larus dominicanus (A) *Sooty tern, Onychoprion fuscatus (A) *Bridled tern, Onychoprion anaethetus *Least tern, Sternula antillarum *Gull-billed tern, Gelochelidon nilotica *Caspian tern, Hydroprogne caspia *Black tern, Chlidonias niger *White-winged tern, Chlidonias leucopterus (A) *Whiskered tern, Chlidonias hybrida (A) *Roseate tern, Sterna dougallii *Common tern, Sterna hirundo *Arctic tern, Sterna paradisaea *Forster's tern, Sterna forsteri *Royal tern, Thalasseus maximus *Sandwich tern, Thalasseus sandvicensis *Elegant tern, Thalasseus elegans (A) *Black skimmer, Rynchops niger Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans with exceptionally long central tail feathers.

Delaware ","title":"List of birds of Delaware"},{"id":"52098636","text":"The Delphic was a British freighter operated by the White Star Line, the company's second ship to bear this name. She was built by the Harland & Wolff shipyards in 1916 to serve the war effort under the name of War Icarus, belonging to the series of \\"Type G\\" cargo ships. Launched in September 1918 and commissioned in the following October, she was the only ship in the series to be completed before the end of the First World War . During this time she was operated by a Liverpool company. In 1919 she was bought by the Atlantic Transport Line, which renamed her Mesaba and operated her for six years. She was then transferred to ATL's sister company, White Star, in 1925, and renamed Delphic, to replace another cargo ship of the same type that had been damaged the previous year, Bardic. For the next eight years, the ship served on the Australian service. In 1933, the company, preparing to merge with the Cunard Line, sold off its now unwanted ships. Delphic was sold, along with sister ship Gallic, to the Clan Line which renamed her Clan Farquhar . She continued to operate on the route to Australia until she was withdrawn for scrapping in 1948, after a total of thirty years of service. History In 1916, in the middle of the First World War, the Harland & Wolff shipyards received orders for a series of 22 so-called \\"Type G\\" freighters to serve the war effort by transporting goods. Among those built in the Belfast yard was War Icarus, which was launched on 19 September 1918, and delivered the following October. It was then, very briefly, managed by the Booth Line on behalf of the Shipping Controller. War Icarus was the only ship of its class to enter service before the end of hostilities. In May 1919, the ship, no longer required by the government, was sold to the Atlantic Transport Line and renamed Mesaba.Mesaba (II), The Atlantic Transport Line. Accessed 13 June 2014. This was the second ship of this name for the company, which lost its first Mesaba a few months earlier when it was sunk by . The company belonged to the International Mercantile Marine Co., a trust which managed several shipping companies. One of them, the White Star Line, had acquired two type G cargo ships in 1919, Bardic and Gallic, which were used on the route to Australia. However, in 1924, Bardic ran aground and was badly damaged. In order to replace her, the Mesaba was transferred to White Star after being overhauled at the Harland & Wolff yards. Renamed Delphic, the second company ship bearing this name, the original being a passenger-cargo liner of 1897, the ship served Australia as a replacement for the Bardic, while the latter was repaired and assigned to another company in IMM. By 1933 Delphic and Gallic were no longer required by the company, which was about to merge with the Cunard Line. Delphic was sold in October to the Clan Line for ¬£53,000. Renamed Clan Farquhar, she continued to serve on the Australian route alongside the former Gallic, now Clan Colquhoun. In July 1948, after an uneventful career of fifteen years with Clan Line, she was scrapped at Milford Haven. Design The Delphic was a wartime ship built quickly and for purely functional purposes, sporting a funnel and two masts that supported the loading cranes. Its navigating bridge was the only superstructure, located a little in front of the funnel, which bore the colours of the White Star Line (brown ochre topped with black)., With a length of and a beam of , it measured 8,002 GT and had six holds. Driven by two propellers powered by two triple expansion engines, she could reach a relatively low speed for the time, from . White Star had, during the 1920s, two other similar cargo ships, Bardic and Gallic, which differ only in their tonnage, slightly lower in the case of the latter.

However, after the Chinese Civil War, the World Bank recognized the Republic of China as its member, until the relationship ended in 1980, when the membership was replaced by the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China (PRC) did not become involved with the World Bank group until 1980, when it first joined the World Bank in April due to the market reforms known as reform and opening-up. Prior to the economic reform and its relation with the World Bank, according to CRS, \\"China maintained policies that kept the economy very poor, stagnant, centrally controlled, vastly inefficient, and relatively isolated from the global economy\\" Since its entry into the World Bank, China has transformed into a market-based economy and has experienced rapid economic and social development. Currently, although China has become the world's second largest economy with 1.4 billion population, it still has a close relationship with the World Bank in areas such as poverty, environmental protection and new challenges from the reform.  History = China Joining the World Bank  The partnership between China and the World Bank began in April 1980 when Deng Xiaoping first met the then president of the World Bank Robert McNamara, since then the World Bank has began its dedication in assisting China's economic development. The World Bank served as a catalytic role in kick-starting China's economic development, when the country initially received approval of its first project loan in 1981. These projects have primarily focused on financing technical assistance such as pension reform, urban housing reform, energy market reform, environmental protection, labor market development, social safety net development, interest rate liberalization and external trade liberalization. Also as important, the technical assistant from the World Bank in areas such as how to appraise and implement priority projects, how to encourage innovation and introduce new technologies, and how to develop institutions and policy instruments needed for good economic management. Since then, China has become one of the largest borrower of loans and recipient of technical assistant from the World Bank.  Relationship with the World Bank  Initially, China was a recipient of International Development Association (IDA), the Bank‚Äôs low-income country arm, and received up to $9.95 billion in concessional loans until 1999. Later when China was categorized as middle- income country, it switched to International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) as its main borrower, and had borrowed $39.8 billion until 2011. Currently China is categorized as an upper-middle-income country, and work with the World Bank mainly for funding small-scale projects. According to World Bank Group‚Äôs Country Partnership Strategy, the bank's activity is classified under five pillars: \\"integrating China in the world economy; reducing poverty, inequality, and social exclusion; managing resource scarcity and environmental challenges; financing sustained and efficient growth; and improving public and market institutions\\" Since the beginning of relation, there has been many success in development over 30 years, which includes economic performance since the market reforms of 1979, urbanization, social developments, and education & health services. China has also been increasing its involvement in the World Bank's administration and contribution to the bank. As China grows in its economic power, it overtook large European nations in voting power at IBRD in 2010, with a jumping increase from 2.77% to 4.42%. In the end of 2019, China holds 5.05% of total votes in IBRD, behind United States (16.37%) and Japan (8.21%), while having more voting power than Germany (4.3%), UK (4%), France (4%), and India (3.11%). As of 2019, China has 2 out of 32 management members on the World Bank leadership. Financially, in 2016, China approved its first SDR bond issuer to IBRD by People's Bank of China, to serve its increasing involvement in international finances.  Project in China  From 1999 to 2011, China borrowed near $40 billion from the IBRD. Up until December 2019, there is a total of 97 ongoing projects in China by World Bank, with $12 billion committed amount of funding. Among them are primarily projects regarding to transportation, public administration, water sanitation&waste;, agriculture, industry‚Ñ¢, and energy&extractives.; Within the World Bank Group, China is one of the largest loan-taking countries. From 2016 to 2018, China was the second largest borrower with $6.19 billion in loans, a number less than India ($8.05 billion) and more than Egypt ($5.23 billion). As China's development solidifies, the World Bank has since shifted its objectives, and focusing on involvements that would support greener growth and sustainable energy, promote more inclusive development in all regions, and advance mutually beneficial relations with the world.  IDA (International Development Association)  In 1981, IDA provided $200 million as its first loan to China for higher education, since then IDA has involved with a catalytic role in China's modernization. By 2007, China was becoming a contributing partner by providing finance and policy input through the replenishment process. China has graduated from IDA in the fiscal year of 1999, and as September 2019, China shares a 2.25% of IDA votes for its increasing role in the IDA finance contribution and technical assistant.  IFC (International Finance Corporation)  Since its first investment in 1985, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) has invested and activated over $13.4 billion to support over 390 projects across 30 provinces, in which as of July 2017, IFC has committed $3.6 billion in China's portfolio. IFC invest and mobilize capital for private sector projects which supports sustainable economic development in China , particularly those that help mitigate climate change, promotes balanced rural-urban development, and promote sustainable investments in emerging markets.  MIGA (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency)  Created in 1988, MIGA encourages foreign direct investment in developing nations by providing political risk insurance to foreign investors and lenders, while also provides strategies for countries to attract and retain foreign direct investments. Since 2000s, MIGA has been providing guarantees for investments into China, particularly for projects that involve sub-sovereign risk, such as water and waste. Meanwhile, MIGA also supports its Chinese partners with their outward investments abroad, including both private lenders and governmental administration.  Involvement and Controversies = China's involvement in international Finance  In 2012 at the fourth BRICS summit, the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa considered the possibility of setting up a new Development Bank to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other emerging economies, as well as in developing countries. In 2016, the New Development Bank (NDB) has become fully operational, and has approved loans involving financial assistance of over $3.4 billion for projects in the areas of green and renewable energy, transportation, water sanitation, irrigation and other areas. In 2016 China projected Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) as a \\"multilateral development bank with a mission to improve social and economic outcomes in Asia\\". As of 2019, it has over 100 members, a co-financing framework with the World Bank and partnership with ADB, ADF, ADB, EDB, EBRD, EIB, IADB, IAIC, IsDBG, and NDB. In 2013, China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative, a transcontinental development project that includes 1/3 of world trade and GDP and over 60% of the world's population. According to World Bank, the string of infrastructure investment could \\"lift 32 million people out of moderate poverty conditions if implemented fully\\". However, as the World Bank report suggest, the cost of project might out-weight the economic benefits, while there has been a lack of transparency.  Controversies of World Bank Projects  One highly controversial World Bank Project was the Gansu and Inner Mongolia Poverty Reduction Project in 1999, which included a 40-meter dam that was projected to displace around 60,000 inhabitants within Qinghai Province. This led to the World Bank ruling to withdraw funding for this section of the project to stop this controversial debate. In the year 2000, the World Bank also stopped the China Western Poverty Reduction project that was originally going to resettle over 58,000 Chinese farmers into Tibet. After reports were released by inspection panel, the project was forced to be withdrawn because reports indicated that the World Bank violated social and environmental policies.

Board of Education in 1954 and 1955.Bart Barnes, \\"Edmund D. Campbell Dies: Fought Segregation in Virginia\\" Washington Post Dec. 9, 1995 p. B6 Campbell and his wife Elizabeth Pfohl Campbell became known for their efforts to improve and desegregate Arlington's public schools, and organized a coalition of parents and citizens from across Virginia (the Save Our Schools Committee) to allow schools which desegregated pursuant to court order to remain open, contrary to the announced policies of Senator Harry F. Byrd and his allies. Early and family life Campbell was born on March 12, 1899 in Lexington, Virginia to Henry Donald Campbell and his wife, the former Martha Miller. Both his grandfather and father had taught at Washington and Lee University. His father often told young Edmund of his own childhood living next to Robert E. Lee, who served as the college's president after the American Civil War, and how he rode behind the former General on his horse, Traveller. Family heirlooms included letters from Confederate Generals Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Edmund Campbell was admitted to Washington and Lee when he was 15 years old and would graduate as valedictorian of his class in 1918. He served six weeks in the U.S. Army, but was discharged a World War I ended.Washington Post obituary Campbell then attended Harvard University and received a master's degree in economics. He returned to Virginia to study law, and graduated first in his class from Washington and Lee Law School in 1922, then moved to Washington, D.C. Campbell married Estelle Butterworth in 1926, and moved across the Potomac River to Arlington. Before her death in 1934, they had a son (who became Rev. Edmund D. Campbell Jr.) and a daughter (Virginia Campbell Holt). In June 1936, Campbell married Elizabeth Pfohl, North Carolina-born president of a women's college in Staunton, Virginia. They had twin sons, Donald and Benjamin, in 1941. The Campbells sent their children to the local public schools. Elizabeth Campbell remained active in education and would later serve on Arlington's school board and help found WETA-TV (Washington Educational Television Association) during their marriage of nearly six decades. Edmund Campbell was also active in the Rotary Club and Masons. He became a vestryman of St. Mary's Episcopal Church in north Arlington,Biography distributed by Democratic Campaign Committee of Arlington County, Virginia for November 7, 1939 general election and would later help found St. Peter's Episcopal Church in north Arlington. Career After admission to the Virginia bar, Campbell moved to Washington, D.C., and later rented a home in Arlington, Virginia, which was a growing streetcar suburb of the national capitol. His legal practice, with Douglas, Obear & Campbell and later Jackson & Campbell, included northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. Campbell was a member of the American Bar Association, the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States, and in 1962 served as President of the Washington D.C. bar association. He also lectured in law for National University in Washington. Arlington County In the 1930s, Campbell served on the Arlington County Public Utilities Commission, which succeeded in reducing gas and electric rates. From 1940 until 1947, Campbell served on the Arlington County Board, including a term as chairman. He helped establish the county's first master zoning plan, and in his last term helped establish Arlington's first elected School Board (on which his wife Elizabeth would serve, including as chairwoman). Campbell then organized Arlingtonians for a Better County, a nonpartisan coalition that became a major force in county politics. In 1952 Campbell narrowly lost his one run for higher office, in the newly created 10th congressional district. The Byrd organization refused to support him because of his desegregation advocacy; Campbell lost by 332 votes to Republican Joel T. Broyhill, a segregationist and World War II veteran. Broyhill would go on to represent the district for almost a quarter-century. Supreme Court advocate As an attorney, Campbell successfully argued a case which overturned a Virginia law prohibiting racially integrated seating in public places. During Massive Resistance, Campbell represented Norfolk parents and schoolchildren in federal court, which led to the three-judge decision in James v. Almond on January 19, 1959, which with a Virginia Supreme Court decision on the same day (both eventually accepted by Governor J. Lindsay Almond Jr.), led Norfolk and Arlington to desegregate their schools (peacefully) in early February, 1959. This led to successful desegregation of local schools across Virginia. Campbell also represented northern Virginia legislators who complained that reapportionment after the 1960 census continued to under-represent the growing northern Virginia suburbs. The United States Supreme Court in Davis v. Mann agreed, leading to the famous \\"one man, one vote\\" rationale. Death and legacy Campbell died at home of cardiopulmonary arrest in December, 1995, survived by his wife, three sons (two of whom had become Episcopal priests), daughter and several grandchildren and great grandchildren. After a funeral service at St. Peter's Church in north Arlington, he was interred in the family plot in Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery in Lexington, Virginia. In 1999, Arlington named a street in the Shirlington commercial area after Campbell and his wife (who one newspaper had called in their lives the \\"first couple of Arlington\\"), and erected signs celebrating their lives.Arlington County press release of January 14, 1999 and program in local library clippings file In 2017, the Arlington Public School board named a new elementary school \\"Campbell Elementary School\\" to honor the contributions of Edmund and Elizabeth Campbell.https://wamu.org/story/17/08/18/time-talk-names-schools-says- arlington-county-school-board/  References  Category:1899 births Category:1995 deaths Category:People from Lexington, Virginia Category:People from Arlington County, Virginia Category:Virginia lawyers Category:County supervisors in Virginia Category:Virginia Democrats Category:Washington and Lee University alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Edmund D.

Clark Jr. In the 1951 election, the voters had elected a Democratic mayor for the first time in 67 years, breaking the Republican hold on political power in the city. They had also elected a majority-Democratic City Council along with Democrats for district attorney and other citywide offices (also called row offices). In 1953, the voters had the chance to continue the Democratic trend or to block it in the election for City Controller, Register of Wills, and various judges and magistrates. On election day, the Republican organization recovered from their 1951 losses, electing all their candidates citywide. Republicans celebrated the victory, but subsequent Democratic triumphs in the 1955 and 1959 elections made the 1953 result more of an aberration than a true comeback for the once- powerful Philadelphia Republican machine. Background Mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr., was not on the ballot in 1953, but both parties made the election a referendum on his administration. After the Democrats' 1951 electoral victory, Philadelphia's once-powerful Republican party organization lost the hold on city government that they had held since 1884. In 1953, they sought to regain their former control over the city's political scene. Both sides presented the election as a referendum on the administration of Mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr., a Democrat elected with the support of reform-minded Republicans and independents in 1951. In an op-ed in The Philadelphia Inquirer the Sunday before the election, Republican City Committee chairman William J. Hamilton called the election \\"an opportunity to pass judgment upon the administration of Mayor Clark who promised so much and gave so little.\\" He called the Clark administration \\"spendthrift and mismanaged\\", and promised \\"honest and efficient management\\" from the Republicans. In another op-ed the same day, Democratic City Committee chairman William J. Green Jr., characterized the Clark administration in more glowing terms and framed the election as a chance for Philadelphians to decide \\"whether 'good government' shall be extended\\" in the city after the reforms of 1951. City Controller Under the 1951 City Charter, Philadelphia elects a City Controller to sit at the head of an independent auditing department. The Controller approves all payments made out of the city treasury and audits the executive departments. As an independently elected official, the Controller is not responsible to the mayor or the city council. The office was created as one of the good-government reforms intended to reduce the corruption that had previously plagued city government and led to the Democratic-led reform coalition of 1951. The Controller is required to audit the city finances annually and to have his work verified by a private accounting firm every three years. The 1953 Republican primary for all offices, including Controller, was complicated by a split in the party hierarchy between the \\"regular\\" faction, led by Hamilton and Board of Revision of Taxes President William F. Meade; and an insurgent faction led by former Sheriff Austin Meehan. An independent slate of Republicans headed by Treasurer candidate George W. Gibson also contested the primary. In the end, Foster A. Dunlap, a local attorney and the Hamilton-Meade candidate, won with 66,557 votes. Meehan's candidate, former Deputy Secretary of Supplies and Services Wilhelm F. Knauer, polled 50,185, and Gibson's running mate, Rudolph F. Price, tallied just 4,566. On the Democratic side, the party organization was much more unified and real estate agent Roland R. Randall was the easy victor over former State Senator H. Jerome Jaspan, 39,824 to 5,111. As the election approached, Democratic District Attorney Richardson Dilworth warned of fraud by Republicans. Clark, for his part, reminded city employees of the charter's prohibition on electioneering by civil servants, most of whom were expected to vote Democratic. Dilworth's fears of fraud did not come to pass, but the election for City Controller did go to the Republicans. Dunlap defeated Randall by more than 14,000 votes in a victory Hamilton called a repudiation of \\"the Clark-Dilworth-ADA combination which has saddled the city with useless debts and experimental government.\\" Other row offices The 1951 charter reforms included consolidation of city and county offices. When all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County were consolidated into one city in 1854, the surviving county offices often duplicated the efforts of city offices. The new charter allowed for their consolidation, but litigation ensued about which county offices were actually state offices, and thus immune from the city's jurisdiction. A State Supreme Court case decided in 1953 settled the issue, for the most part, leaving the Register of Wills as an independently elected official. For Register of Wills, as for City Controller, the Republicans had a primary fight between the Hamilton-Meade regulars and the Meehan faction. As in that contest, the regulars were victorious, nominating Robert C. Duffy, attorney and former football star, with 67,283 votes. In second came Meehan's man, Morris J. Root, with 42,977, and William P. Shermer, an independent candidate, with 8,909. The Democrats had an easier time nominating former Congressman Francis R. Smith, who trounced Joseph F. Amodie, 40,582 to 5,470. The general election contest was one of the closest on the ballot but the Republican, Duffy, still defeated the Democrat by more than 7,500 votes. The State Supreme Court decision on citywide elected offices (also called row offices) was silent about the offices of city treasurer and coroner. While some city officials took this to mean that those offices could be converted to civil service positions, the City Commissioners (who were in charge of elections) interpreted the ruling the opposite way. As Democratic Commissioner Thomas P. McHenry said, \\"we have had no specific law to cover the situation regarding the Treasurer and Coroner's offices.\\" As a result, candidates were allowed to campaign for the two offices, even though it was unclear that the offices would continue to exist. For both offices, the Republicans nominated regulars. The incumbent treasurer, Francis D. Pastorius, defeated William M. Paschall and Gibson, with 71,364 to Pastorius, 41,244 to Paschall, and 10,464 to Gibson. The Democrats nominated Joseph F. Vogt without opposition, though he had died in April, a month before the May primary. (Vogt's was the only name on the ballot.) In September, the Democratic City Committee nominated State Representative Granville E. Jones in Vogt's place. For coroner, the nominations followed a similar pattern. The Hamilton-Meade faction nominated Edward E. Holloway, who defeated Meehan man Roger J. Soens and independent Vincent E. Costello for the Republican nomination. The Democrats renominated the incumbent, Joseph Ominsky, over challenger Gust G. Tatlas. Shortly before election day, City Council acted to resolve the ambiguity over the offices by formally abolishing them. The act folded the coroner's office into the Health Department and the treasurer's office into the Finance Department, with informal arrangements for both incumbents to retain jobs in their respective departments as employees. In the general election, Pastorius was reelected to the abolished office, leading the entire ticket with 288,707 votes, nearly 20,000 more than Jones. Holloway also defeated Ominsky by more than 12,000 votes, making a clean sweep for Republicans. After the election, Pastorius and Holloway announced plans for a lawsuit challenging the abolition of their offices. Pastorius claimed the abolition subverted democracy, saying \\"[i]f you permit an office to be abolished after the process of election has begun, you open the door to rigged elections.\\" The men took their oaths of office in January 1954 for the terms to which they had been elected, but did not pursue the lawsuits and relinquished the offices the next day. Judges and magistrates Although Pennsylvania's judges are elected in partisan elections, there had been a tradition of not challenging the re-election of incumbents, or \\"sitting judges.\\" To that end, judicial candidates were typically endorsed by both major parties. The parties had followed the sitting judge tradition in 1951, but in 1953 the Democrats broke the informal pact and endorsed just three of the sitting judges, all of whom had been elected as Republicans years earlier. The result was an unusually intense contest for the thirteen seats available. There were also eleven seats open for magistrate, a local court, the duties of which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court. As in the other races, the Republicans triumphed. The three cross-endorsed judges won, as did the six Republican-backed incumbents. Four Republicans were also elected to open seats. In the magistrate elections, the Republicans took seven of the eleven seats, the maximum allowed by one party. James J. Clothier, the chief magistrate and a Republican, led all magistrates in votes. Ballot questions Philadelphians saw three ballot questions in the primary election, all of which involved allowing the city to borrow money. The loans, on the ballot at Clark's urging, were designed to allow the city to temporarily increase spending without raising taxes, and were opposed by many ward leaders in both parties. As a result, they went down to unexpected defeat by a 3:2 margin. Undeterred, Clark and his allies revised and relisted the loans for a vote in the general election in November, which would see better turnout and, they believed, a better chance of success. On the November ballot, the first loan would involve $19 million for parks, libraries, roads, and firehouses. The second authorized borrowing $35,750,000 for sewers and mass transit infrastructure. The third question reorganized the city's existing borrowing to free up $21,650,000 of borrowing power. On the second try, the electorate approved all three loans with 62.07%, 62.39%, and 59.13%, respectively.

In the years following World War II new departments and faculties were established, more students decided to study there, and the faculty increased in number. MISI scientists were implementing fundamental academic research. The Institute made contacts and formed a scientific partnership with Russian and foreign institutes. In the 1960s and 1970s, new departments were established: \\"Heat and Energy Engineering,\\" \\"Automated Systems of Construction Control,\\" and others. New laboratories and educational campuses were built in the Moscow region, together with new student dormitories. Starting in 1956, MISI students annually spent the summer semester at construction sites. Although the university experienced a budget shortage in the 1980s and 1990s, the institute continued to successfully develop. In 1988, the Education and Methodical Association for Civil Engineering Specialties was established on the basis of MISI. It comprised 28 technical institutes of higher education and some 1000 industrial, polytechnic, technological civil engineering departments. The International Association of Institutions of Higher Education in Civil Engineering was established in 1991. It is headed by the Rector of National Research University MGSU, Andrey Anatolyevich Volkov. In 1993, the Institute changed its status. It was renamed the Moscow State University of Civil Engineering (MGSU). In 2010, the university was given the status of National Research University, implementing educational and academic activity on the basis of the principles of integration of science and education.

Later on, after the war, he made important contributions concerning semantic consequences () and provability logic (). He worked as a mathematical theoretician and cryptanalyst for the civilian Pers Z S, the cipher bureau of the Foreign Office (), from Spring 1941 to the end of World War II. Personal life From 1928 to 1936, Schr√∂ter studied mathematics, physics, philosophy, and psychology at the Universities of G√∂ttingen, Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main. Due to family reasons he had to interrupt his studies several times. He then worked in the mathematical logic group at the University of M√ºnster lead by Heinrich Scholz. From April 1, 1939, he was a research assistant at the Department of Philosophy at the University of M√ºnster. On 20 December 1941, he took his examination for promotion of Dr. phil under the logician Heinrich Scholz studying mathematics, logic, and calculus with a thesis titled Ein allgemeiner Kalk√ºlbegriff (). On April 1, 1941, he took a leave of absence to join Pers Z S, the Foreign Office civilian cipher bureau, working as a mathematician. However, even during this time he continued to work on problems of basic mathematical research. On 19 March 1943 he presented the application to the Faculty of Philosophy and Natural Sciences, with the publication Axiomatisierung der Fregeschen Aussagenkalk√ºle (), to be admitted to his Habilitation. On the basis of the positive opinions of Heinrich Scholz and Adolf Kratzer, the degree of Doctor rerum naturalium habilitatus was awarded to him by certificate of May 22, 1943. On June 9, 1943, the report on the completed Habilitation was given to the Reich Minister. On July 1, 2 and 3, 1943, he held a public trial lecture on the topic Der Nutzen der mathematischen Logik f√ºr die Mathematik () as a prerequisite for a civil service position as a lecturer. On August 18, 1943, he was appointed lecturer with the authorisation to teach \\"Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Research\\", all the while still being employed in Berlin as a \\"scientific assistant worker\\" at Pers Z S. Karl Schr√∂ter remained at the University of M√ºnster from 31 December 1943 until his contract was up on 31 April 1945, when he was taken prisoner by the Counterintelligence Corps (CIC). From early May to the September 30, 1945, he appeared before a joint Anglo-American Commission, first in London, then in Marburg, concerning his work at Pers Z S during the war. After completion, he was dismissed in Marburg after the CIC had determined his political attitude. In the winter semester of 1945/46 he was affiliated as a lecturer in M√ºnster. From May 1946 until his appointment to Berlin, Schr√∂ter was working at M√ºnster as a substitute for the Review Committee of the Denazification Main Committee at the Westf√§lische Landesuniversit√§t. In 1948, Karl Schr√∂ter was appointed Professor Extraordinarius for mathematical logic at Humboldt University in Berlin. In 1967, he became director of the Institute for pure mathematics of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin. He was elected corresponding member in 1962 and two years later ordinary member of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin.

Biography From 1904 to 1905 he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest with Tivadar Zempl√©nyi.Brief biography @ J-Art. It was there he became interested in painting scenes from everyday life. He could not, however, tolerate the conservative approach taken by the Academy so, thanks to a scholarship from the city government of Nagyv√°rad (today Oradea, Romania), he went to Paris to study at the Acad√©mie Julian. While there, he worked with Jean-Paul Laurens, who encouraged him to paint portraits; notably of the poets Endre Ady and , an old friend from school. After returning from Paris, he held his first solo exhibition in Oradea and was married shortly thereafter. From 1912 to 1914, he exhibited in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Copenhagen and several cities in Germany, but he always made Nagyv√°rad his center of activity. During this time, he also helped organize an art and literature society called \\"Holnap\\" (Tomorrow). He was often referred to as the \\"painter of Nagyv√°rad\\". Peasants with Goat His career was interrupted by service in World War I, although he sketched while at the front. Afterward, he began to organize exhibits, including a major showing of local artists in Bucharest. He would continue to exhibit there at the Official Salon. Later in the 1920s, he made lengthy visits to Italy and France (notably Brittany). In 1935, with financial support from Oradea, he travelled the Black Sea coast from Balchik to the Soviet border and expanded his palette of colors. Following the establishment of the Fascist r√©gime in 1940, persecution by the Iron Guard prevented him from participating in public events in Romania, although he was able to quietly contribute to some as late as 1942. After that, he unsuccessfully tried to exhibit at the Budapest Salon. In the aftermath of Operation Margarethe, an effort was made to \\"cleanse\\" the Hungarian-speaking areas of Jews. In May 1944 he was transported to the concentration camp at Auschwitz then transferred to a forced-labor group at Dachau. He was put to death there early the next year, not long before the camp was liberated. In 1990, an art society and gallery bearing his name was established in one of Oradea's historic buildings. In January 1992 a large retrospective of local Jewish painters was held at the Muzeul »öƒÉrii Cri»ôurilor in Oradea. The exhibition was called \\"Light and Spirit\\" and included Tibor's works together with those of Alex Leon, Ern≈ë Gr√ºnbaum and M√≥ric Bar√°t (1880-1944).

He was possibly the first person to use X-rays to treat cancer, which he did in July 1896 for a patient with stomach cancer. He was also the first physician to publish a paper on radiation therapy, in 1896, dealing with that case. This attempt was less than a year after the publication of the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm R√∂ntgen.  Personal life  Francois Victor Despeignes was born in Lyon in 1866. He was buried at the cemetery in a small village in the Dr√¥me Proven√ßale called Vinsobres.  Cancer treatment  Researchers had already discovered that X-rays could kill bacteria by 1896. The predominant theory at the time was that cancer was some kind of parasitic infection. Louis Charles √âmile Lortet and Philibert Jean Victor Genoud tried to kill tuberculosis in infected guinea pigs using X-rays from March to June 1896 in the same city of Lyon. A 52-year-old man with an epigastric tumor presented to Despeignes. The tumor was about the size of the head of an eight-month-old fetus. Despeignes believed that cancer was caused by parasites, and that perhaps he could kill the parasite with radiation. On 4 July 1896 he commenced the X-ray treatments. Two half-hour treatments were given each day. Other treatments given to the patient were opium for pain relief, morphine and chloroform. A diet of condurango and milk was prescribed, with injections of artificial serum. The patient experienced pain relief, but died on 24 July. The cancer had shrunk by about 50%. Despeignes' equipment consisted of a Crookes' tube and six Radiguet battery elements. Inspired by this, other physicians tried using X-rays to treat numerous human ailments from acne to breast cancer. Malignancies were found to be the most amenable to X-ray treatment. They also found out the side effects.  Other work  Between 1866 and 1894, Despeignes worked as a hygienist physician in Lyon. He researched the quality of tap water and tuberculosis. He became the chief of the laboratory of Louis Pasteur in 1892. Between 1907 and 1937 he was the director of town hygiene in Chamb√©ry.

Background Following Australia's entry into the first World War, thousands of Queenslanders enlisted in the military to go and fight in Europe. However, as the war dragged on and it became evident that victory would not be achieved quickly or easily, the initial enthusiasm for the conflict waned and recruitment rates began to decline. The British government, needing fresh manpower to bolster its reserves in France, pressured the Australian federal government to send more reinforcements. The federal government, led by Billy Hughes, did not have the numbers to legislate for compulsory military service (conscription), and Hughes held a plebiscite in 1916 in an attempt to win the necessary political support to conscript able-bodied men and send them to Europe. This plan was derailed when, amongst much community division and controversy, the plebiscite returned a \\"No\\" result. The resulting political fallout led Hughes to leave his party, forming an alliance with former political foes, and a second plebiscite was called in an attempt to overturn the result of the previous one. T. J. Ryan, Premier of Queensland in 1917 The Queensland Government had originally been mildly supportive of the notion of conscription, but this ended with the defeat of the Commonwealth Liberal government under Digby Denham, and the election of a Labor government led by T. J. Ryan in 1915. Initially ambivalent about the issue (Ryan having deferred from signing a letter in support of conscription in the days before the 1916 vote) the Ryan government's stance hardened by late 1916, as the position of the party's rank-and-file membership swung decisively to opposing compulsory service. This opposition was not welcomed by Hughes, and Ryan was the only state premier to openly oppose the federal government on the issue. The split became serious by 1917, with Ryan acknowledged as the de facto leader of those advocating a \\"No\\" vote in the 1917 plebiscite on conscription, and the state and federal government at odds on other issues including industrial disputes, price controls, and coastal shipping. The federal government responded to this anti-conscription sentiment in the community with a series of censorship measures, enabled by the War Precautions Act 1914 which permitted the federal government to censor speech which in their view would have interfered with the war effort. Some of these censorship measures were unorthodox even for the time; the public performance of I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier was prohibited, a ban that was openly flouted by radical anti-conscription campaigner Cecilia John. An Australian Government regulation was issued in 1917 prohibiting over 200 publications, as diverse as Hearst newspapers from America, The Cincinnati Enquirer, Harpers Bazaar, as well as seemingly innocuous publications such as Cosmopolitan, Motor, and Good Housekeeping. Premier Ryan and Treasurer Ted Theodore, finding the situation intolerable, decided to counteract the actions of censor Jeremiah Stable by reading out some of the banned material on the floor of the Queensland Parliament, working on the theory that parliamentary privilege would allow a Hansard containing the material to be distributed. The raid Hughes did not take the provocation from Ryan lightly. Because the postal service was under the control of the Australian Government, Hughes ordered federal authorities to prevent the Hansard from being distributed through the post. Travelling to Brisbane ostensibly to address a public meeting, Hughes arrived late at night with Stable and a detachment of soldiers at the Queensland Government Printing Office, seizing all 3,300 printed copies of Hansard, along with all of the type. Hughes then informed Ryan that while there was \\"nothing worth censoring\\" in his own speeches, the anti-conscription materials of Theodore and his fellow minister John Fihelly were objectionable and would not be allowed to be distributed. Hughes also informed the Government Printer, A. J. Cummings, not to publish any further copies of the Hansard. Cummings was an ardent conscriptionist, and disclosed to Hughes that Ryan had ordered him to ignore any censorship instructions that he might receive, and that if the Army were to attempt to enter the printing office by force, the Queensland Police would \\"offer every assistance in their power\\" to prevent them from doing so. Upon learning this, an alarmed Stable, not wanting the situation to descend into violence, cabled Hughes and asked if there were any way to solve the problem without resorting to armed force. The following day, 27 November, Ryan demanded an explanation from Hughes for the seizure of Hansard, and for the failure of the postal service to transmit copies of the Hansard to subscribers. Ryan also had a special issue of the Government Gazette issued that described the situation, and gave a general description of the contents of the Hansard, without giving any specific details that might fall afoul of the censor. Hughes responded, taking responsibility for both actions, accusing Ryan of publishing a document that was \\"a Hansard in name only\\", and putting Ryan on notice that \\"if some of the statements published in your so-called Hansard are repeated outside (of parliamentary privilege), I shall know how to deal with them\\". A Queensland Government cabinet meeting decided that a policy of \\"direct confrontation\\" would be adopted, with armed police being stationed inside the printing office, and Ryan would be protected around the clock by an armed guard. Fihelly arranged for trade unionists from the Brisbane Industrial Council to get involved, with between four and five hundred unionists to be sworn in as special constables to maintain order should an armed struggle with the Australian Government begin. Plans were drawn up to sever railway connections, block the Brisbane River, and to seize all means of communication with the outside world. Late on the evening of 27 November, Hughes dispatched Stable, along with his private secretary Percy Deane, to visit the printing office once more. Stable and Deane were denied entry by the policemen at the front door, and Stable was reportedly trying to scale a side wall of the building when Cummings let them in through a rear entrance, allowing Stable to inspect the presses and determine that no further copies of the offending Hansard had been printed. Aftermath In addition to the direct confrontation at the Printing Office, Hughes also attacked Ryan and Theodore through the courts, charging them for having made false statements in relation to the availability of volunteer reinforcements. A hearing in December 1917 made a decision in favour of Ryan, awarding him costs. A second attempt to prosecute Ryan on similar grounds also failed, at which point Ryan brought charges against Hughes and Hughes brought charges against Ryan. These cases were terminated in April 1918 when both parties agreed to withdraw the cases against each other and let the matter rest. Ryan sent a cable to the office of the Queensland Government in London after the second referendum, requesting publication of his government's position against conscription in England. This cable was numbered 50, and according to Ryan a response was received from the Agent-General confirming receipt of cables number 49 and 51, and enquiring about the \\"missing\\" cable 50. Suspicion immediately fell upon Hughes, but no evidence was presented and no interference on his part was ever proven. For his part, Hughes decided to insure against the \\"co-ordinated left- wing groups preparing to seize (Brisbane)\\" by arranging for the dispatch of several large crates labelled \\"Furniture\\" to the homes of certain loyalists in Brisbane, which were reputedly filled with \\"rifles and machine guns\\". Even amongst Hughes' supporters on the pro-conscription side, opinion on the way he handled the matter were mixed. New South Wales Attorney-General David Hall opined that the dogged pursuit of Ryan had only given Ryan a higher profile and popularity than he otherwise would have enjoyed, and set him up for a national career in politics.

Postwar, she continued to serve and was a lecturer in foreign languages at the Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy before her retirement. After retiring, Gasheva worked in the Bureau of Foreign Military Literature at Voenizdat.  Early life  Gasheva was born on 14 October 1921 in the village of Verkhnechusovsky Gorodky in Permsky Uyezd, part of the Perm Governorate.

Biography A graduate of Columbia University, Wickes was a teacher, writer and playwright for children and teenagers in New York but later became interested in becoming a Jungian therapist, especially for artists, and visited Zurich several times after meeting Carl Jung in 1920s, with whom Wickes maintained a correspondence. Wickes kept a diary of dreams and made conferences, especially at the Analytical Psychology Club of New York. Wickes had a husband, Thomas Wickes (divorced in 1910 and died about 1947) and a son, Eliphalet Wickes (1906‚Äì1926). Wickes lived also in California and Alaska. Jung wrote the preface to her second book on the psychological world of children (1927), where Wickes supported the autonomous presence of the child in the collective unconscious, according to the idea of a participation mystique, which Lucien L√©vy-Bruhl in 1910 had theorized to exist within primitive societies, Wickes's comparing a child to an individual in training and giving more place to intuition and feeling than attention to the real or rational. The book was translated into German, French, Dutch, Italian and Greek. In coming decades Wickes helped found Spring, which bills itself as the oldest Jungian journal,http://www.springjournalandbooks.com/cgi- bin/ecommerce/ac/agora.cgi?cartlink=history.html and lectured at various branches of the Jung Institutes. Among Wickes's correspondents are preserved letters to Muriel Rukeyser (1913‚Äì1980), Henry Murray, Eudora Welty, Mary Louise Peebles (1833‚Äì1915), Martha Graham, Lewis Mumford, Thomas Mann, May Sarton, Robert Edmond Jones (1887‚Äì1954) and William McGuire (1917‚Äì2009).

Biography Ruby Foo was born in San Francisco in 1904. In 1923, she moved to Boston, where she started a one-room restaurant in Chinatown. The venture was a success, and in 1929 she opened Ruby Foo's Den, a restaurant and nightclub, at 6 Hudson Street.

In the 1930s and 40s it was a nationally known gathering place for famous athletes, actors, and other celebrities. It became one of the first Boston restaurants to expand into other cities when Foo lent her name to similar establishments in New York City, Miami, Washington D.C., Providence, and Montreal. Foo was a mentor to many aspiring chefs in the Boston area. Foo was married three times and had two children, Earl and Doris Shong. Her third husband was William Wong. According to the Boston Globe, after seeing the famous \\"Bloody Saturday\\" photograph of a crying baby in a bombed-out Shanghai railway station, she arranged to have the baby brought to the U.S., where she adopted him in 1938, naming him Ronald.

The episode was written by co- executive producers Steven Lilien and Bryan Wynbrandt and directed by Nathan Hope. It was first broadcast on October 24, 2016. In the episode, Jervis Tetch begins to formulate a plan to lure out Gordon to him by the use of many people involved. Gordon is beginning to be aided by a white-suited man, the White Rabbit, in order to find Tetch, who's waiting for him to arrive and exact his revenge for Alice's death. Meanwhile, Cobblepot is ready to confess his love for Nygma, when Nygma finds someone close to him. The episode received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the episode for its writing and dark tone. Comic Book Resources named the episode as the 6th best episode in 2016 among comic book-related television series. Plot In Gotham Cathedral, a couple gets married and leave on their limousine. The driver is revealed to be Tetch (Benedict Samuel), who states that he will not hurt them as that decision will be based on Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and it is also revealed that he has a child in the passenger seat. In Dahl Manor, Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) tells his servant (who does not speak English) that he plans on revealing his true feelings for Nygma (Cory Michael Smith). Gordon and Valerie (Jamie Chung) are having breakfast in a diner when Valerie tells him that she wants to talk to Lee (Morena Baccarin) about Alice Tetch's blood. Despite knowing that it would be uncomfortable, he agrees to help her. She leaves and then, a white-suited man (Kieran Mulcare) appears to Gordon, telling him a message from Tetch, \\"Follow my friend where to go, to learn the truth you've hidden below. Should you choose not to play, precious people will die today.\\" Gordon goes with the white-suited man to a street where a phone rings. Gordon answers it to find Tetch at the other end, taunting him over the phone, revealing that he has hypnotized the married couple and are going to fall to their deaths, in the overpass in front of Gordon. Tetch states that he can run upstairs to save the couple but below the bridge there is a child who is going to be hit by a hypnotized driver, wanting to reveal to Gordon that he cannot save both. After deciding, he chooses to save the boy and the couple fall from the bridge, killing themselves. Gordon then receives another call by Tetch, telling him to meet him in five minutes on a new address. Lee's and Mario's (James Carpinello) engagement is announced to the press and Mario states that Falcone is planning on throwing an engagement party for them. The GCPD is investigating the couple's death and upon seeing that Gordon saved the boy, Barnes (Michael Chiklis) tells Bullock (Donal Logue) to put an all-points bulletin on Gordon. They find the white-suited man in the street and as he continues repeating the same words, they deduce that Tetch hypnotized him. Gordon arrives at the address and finds many photos and articles related to him and a telescope. A phone rings, revealing Tetch to be at the sight of the telescope. Gordon begins to taunt him by hanging up the phone many times, telling him that Alice is dead because of him and that he has to die to get revenge. After this, Tetch reveals that he has kidnapped Valerie. Gordon confronts Barbara (Erin Richards) in the Sirens, as she was the only person who knew about him, revealing that Tetch came earlier and told him everything. Gordon receives another call from Tetch, who now has kidnapped Lee and tells him to go to a water plant. In the plant, Gordon finds two people, an anchorman and a pediatrician tied to chairs with helmets on their heads that will send an electric shock that one will die. The GCPD arrives to help but Tetch turns the helmets on, killing them both while telling Gordon that an old friend will tell him what to do next. Valerie and Lee are chained in a bathroom and while speaking to each other, Valerie tries to get the information to the story but Lee is not interested. In the GCPD, Gordon notices the white-suited man arrested, realizing he is the \\"old friend\\" Tetch was referring to. The man writes, \\"The true test will be revealed. A final decision you must yield. Our tea party begins once more, when you walk through Lee Thompkins' door.\\" Gordon is then confronted by Mario, who believes that he could know about her. Gordon enters Lee's apartment to find Lee and Valerie on chairs in the dining room, preparing for a tea party while Tetch and the Tweed Brothers hold them at gunpoint. Tetch forces Gordon to sit for the \\"tea party\\", relating Alice's story to everyone in the table. He then takes out a gun and tells Gordon which one of them loves the most so he can kill her to get revenge for Alice's death. While this is happening, Mario enters the house by the basement and grabs a gun. Gordon begins to distract Tetch enough time for Mario to enter the room and hold Tetch at gunpoint; however, Tetch already found the gun and took out the bullets and has Mario chained in the bathroom while the tea party continues. Gordon begins to deviate his version of Alice's story as she states that she preferred to die rather than spending her life with him as she hated him. This causes Tetch's rage, to which he tells Gordon to tell him who to kill. At the last moment, Gordon tells him to kill Lee but as Tetch believes Valerie is his love, he shoots her instead and leaves. Gordon and Lee rush Valerie to the hospital, with Mario doing the surgery. Cobblepot is preparing a dinner for Nygma, planning on finally confessing his love for him. Nygma is buying wine when he runs into a woman named Isabella (Chelsea Spack), who resembles Kristen Kringle, and they begin to bond with their fascination for riddles. In the hospital, Gordon wants to talk to Lee about what happened, but she tells him that it's not time. Production=Development On July 2016, it was announced that the sixth episode of the season will be titled \\"Follow the White Rabbit\\" and was to be written by new co-executive producers and Alcatraz co-creators Steven Lilien & Bryan Wynbrandt and directed by Nathan Hope. Writing The episode receive attention upon the revelation that Oswald Cobblepot's character turned out to be gay. Actor Robin Lord Taylor talked about the move, \\"Part of it is just that residual fear of homophobia that I've experienced my entire life. And granted, I don't think Oswald is gay, per se. But the fact that he's having romantic feelings for another man, however anyone wants to label that, it still feels a little bit like coming out again. Only on a much, much, much bigger scale.\\" Casting David Mazouz, Sean Pertwee, Camren Bicondova, Chris Chalk, Drew Powell and Maggie Geha don't appear in the episode as their respective characters. In October 2016, it was announced that the guest cast for the episode would include James Carpinello as Mario Calvi, Jamie Chung as Valerie Vale, Chelsea Spack as Isabella and Kieran Mulcare as White Rabbit. Set photos were revealed on August confirming Mulcare's involvement but his role on the series was not specified.

Critical reviews \\"Mad City: Follow the White Rabbit\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. The episode received a rating of 100% with an average score of 8.2 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.9 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Gotham went dark this week by adding even more coal to Jim Gordon's already- formidable furnace of excruciating trauma. Mad Hatter sought to drive Jim mad and my *hat* goes off to the series for not rescuing Gordon at the last minute, forcing him to make that final choice between his two loves. And speaking of love, I also applaud the show for making the Penguin/Riddler relationship be much more than a tease. Even if it is just one-sided right now.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the series a perfect star rating of 5 out of 5, writing \\"The best part of this episode was the pulse-pounding nature of it. Every second was urgent. I loved that it wasn't wrapped up in a nice little bow. It was dark and gritty, and you could really tell that the Mad Hatter was working hard to devastate Jim, and that it was working. I hate when shows set up a scenario like this, only to weasel out of it somehow. But first he saved the kid and lost the married couple, and I knew from that moment on that this was going to be a dark one. Despite trying to get out unscathed with Mario's help, Valerie gets shot. Now, I'm pretty certain that Jim new what was going to happen, and he was taking his chances with Valerie receiving good care from the two doctors in the building. But it sets up a really poignant story going forward, as I doubt Valerie will see it that way.\\" Sage Young of EW gave the episode a \\"B-\\" and stated: \\"Last week, Benedict Samuel's deranged Mad Hatter only showed up in one bloody tableau. In 'Follow the White Rabbit,' every other story save one takes the episode off so that Jervis Tetch can get his revenge on James Gordon. Shocker: Playing dress-up with a doomed young women hasn't turned out to be the healthiest method of grieving his sister. Plan B involves constructing an elaborate scavenger hunt for his nemesis so that Gordon will feel the same pain that Jervis does. It gets him out of the house, I suppose.\\" Lisa Babick from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Maybe Jim is going to be the one to push Barnes towards his true destiny. All I know is I can't wait for Barnes to cross over to the dark side. That burly bastard needs something else to do than push around Gotham's finest. So, hurry up with it already, Gotham. Please.\\" Vinnie Mancuso of New York Observer wrote, \\"Elsewhere, Gothams moving parts didn't do much to warrant more than a passing mention, as entertaining as they all are. I mean, it's huge for both character and canon that Oswald Cobblepot articulated, out loud, the words 'I love you,' but it will have more weight when the chair across from him isn't empty. Meanwhile, Erin Richards has been pulling off the Herculean feat of stealing every scene she's in as bananas-as-hell Barbara Kean, while at the same time being given so little of substance to do by Gotham‚Äòs writers. I'm not entirely convinced Richards isn't just showing up to set with a bottle of wine and commenting on the scenes happening around her without a script.\\" Megan Vick of TV.com wrote, \\"Gothams Jim Gordon hasn't been given that stripped-down treatment until now and if Tetch's antics are just the beginning of a season-long focus on the minutiae of Gordon, then I am so excited for the rest of this season.\\" Kayti Burt of Den of Geek gave a perfect 5 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"To be fair, so far, Barnes' angry outbursts don't actually seem that out of character. He's always been kind of a yell-y guy. But that doesn't mean he won't soon go into a rage-spiral and take a bite out of someone, a la the rats Lee and co. have been testing Alice's blood on. Barnes' descent into madness might not be the most interesting thing that's going on on Gotham right now, but the show's slow, steady unfurling of this plotline is indicative of a larger patience Gotham is demonstrating with its plots this season.

Album Reviews  Consequence of SoundREVIEW: Jeff Rosenstock delivers punk rock‚Äôs 'Abbey Road' with ‚ÄòWORRY.' The album was promoted with two singles: \\"Festival Song\\", released on July 14, 2016, and \\"Wave Goodnight to Me\\", released on September 7, 2016.

Background  After ska punk band Bomb the Music Industry! announced their breakup in 2014, frontman Rosenstock quickly released his first solo album We Cool? in 2015. On July 14, 2016, Rosenstock released a new song, \\"Festival Song\\", off a yet-to-be-titled new album out later in the year. On August 16, 2016, Rosenstock announced a tour with Hard Girls and Katie Ellen, with SideOneDummy Records hinting \\"Maybe that means a new album is coming soon? He did release a new song called 'Festival Song' recently. I don't know anything.\\" On September 7, 2016, Rosenstock announced the title and release date of the album along with the release of the album's second single, \\"Wave Goodnight to Me\\", which was given a music video filmed at Comet Ping Pong in Washington, D.C. and directed by Ben Epstein and David Combs of The Max Levine Ensemble.  Composition  Clocking in at 37 minutes and containing 17 tracks, Worry. has been described as pop punk and \\"anti- capitalist power pop\\". The final eight songs of the album segue into each other in a manner described as similar to The Beatles' Abbey Road and the compilation Short Music for Short People. The medley comprises various musical styles and genres, with the punk rock \\"Bang on the Door\\" flowing into the ska \\"Rainbow\\" into the hardcore punk \\"Planet Luxury\\". Rosenstock has named The Clash, Neutral Milk Hotel's On Avery Island, The Beach Boys' Smile and Less Than Jake as influences on Worry., specifically citing The Clash's double album London Calling as an inspiration for the short song structures on Worry.'s second half.  Lyrical content  Worry. explores political lyrical themes. Lead single \\"Festival Song\\" was written as a criticism of corporate- sponsored music festivals after Rosenstock witnessed a band at a festival condemn surveillance culture and corporations while surrounded by the same institutions. \\"I‚Äôm not trying to call anybody a sellout,\\" Rosenstock said of the song. \\"I just feel like people, at this point, don‚Äôt think that you can do it another way anymore. It‚Äôs just so accepted. It‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòOh yeah, we got to do this thing this way. There‚Äôs going to be corporate sponsors on this thing.‚Äô\\" \\"The Fuzz\\" discusses police brutality, while \\"Wave Goodnight to Me\\" was written about the gentrification of Brooklyn pushing out longtime residents. \\"To Be a Ghost...\\" contains lyrics about the negative effects of internet and meme culture. Rosenstock also discusses personal topics on Worry. Album opener \\"We Begged 2 Explode\\" discusses his feelings about whether or not being a musician was the right life choice for him; the album was written as Rosenstock was turning 34 years old. \\"Pash Rash\\" and \\"Blast Damage Days\\" reference the complications of technology and its effect on modern romance, with lyrics such as \\"These are the Amazon days / We are the binge-watching age / And we‚Äôll be stuck in a screen until our phones fall asleep.\\" \\"I Did Something Weird Last Night\\" references 'irrational, giddy emotion' about falling in love, which Rosenstock wrote about his now-wife as the two were beginning their relationship. Worry. was Rosenstock's first release on SideOneDummy Records, which inspired him to specifically write more politically conscious lyrics due to the wider audience he knew the album would have on a bigger label. \\"I wanted these lyrics to be punk as fuck, to reflect that same feeling that reading the lyrics of Operation Ivy gave me when I was a teenager,‚Äù Rosenstock said.  Reception  Worry. received critical acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 80 based on 6 reviews. USA Today proclaimed it the best album of 2016, declaring that \\"In 17 songs, Rosenstock tells his story, one that is also our story, about regrets and hopes and more regrets, about what it‚Äôs like trying to maintain your humanity in a digital age, when you can sign on Facebook and find yourself 'amongst apologists who love ignoring the reality / of unarmed civilians executed publicly.'‚Äù Ian Cohen of Pitchfork stated that although \\"Rosenstock didn‚Äôt really need a magnum opus to solidify his reputation as one of the most important figures in modern punk music\\", the potency of the album's political lyrical content was amplified following the election of Donald Trump less than a month after its release. Consequence of Sound wrote \\"WORRY. feels like the true start of Rosenstock‚Äôs solo career, with a backing band that is finally locked in, a record label 100 percent behind him, and a tower of critical accolades growing taller each day.\\" Timothy Monger of AllMusic said that \\"At times wistful and contemplative, frequently explosive, and pleasantly damaged, Worry. holds true to its creator's D.I.Y. aesthetic and pop-punk/ska roots while continuing to emphasize his new power pop direction\\". In 2019, Entertainment Weekly named Worry. the ninth-best overlooked album of the decade, stating that it \\"was released less than a month before Donald Trump was elected, but it still feels like the most accurate depiction of how things have felt since he took office. The punk veteran was singing about gentrification, all-encompassing corporatization, and how our internet-induced anhedonia has made the bad things feel even worse.\\" Track listingPersonnel Band * Jeff Rosenstock - vocals, guitar, keyboards, saxophone, etc. * John DeDomenici - bass * Mike Huguenor - guitar, backing vocals * Kevin Higuchi - drums, percussion, backing vocals Production * Jack Shirley - recording, engineering, production, mixing, mastering External links * WORRY. on Quote Unquote Records References Category:2016 albums Category:Jeff Rosenstock albums Category:SideOneDummy Records albums ","title":"Worry.

Mark McMorris' brother Craig McMorris, as well as Silje Norendal, Torstein Horgmo, Ulrik Badertscher, and Danny Davis were announced as part of the playable roster.http://www.polygon.com/2016/8/30/12711374/mark-mcmorris-infinite-air- release-date-snowboarders-trailer  Gameplay  Infinite Air emphasizes simulation-style gameplay, much like HB Studios‚Äô previous work with The Golf Club and Madden 15. Rather than executing tricks through button combos, players use the control sticks of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One controllers. The left stick controls carving, quick flips, and spins, while the right controls pre-loaded flip torques, shifters, tweaks, and the grab location on your board while in the air. The trigger buttons control right and left grabs. Like The Golf Club, Infinite Air features procedurally generated courses as well as level editors. Players can share their courses online with others through the game‚Äôs social features.  Development  Mark McMorris Infinite Air is designed to do what EA's Skate franchise did for the skateboarding genre. Focusing on physics and realism rather than the arcade style of many other popular snowboarding series, Infinite Air was built in the Unity engine and uses the input of professional snowboarder Mark McMorris to incorporate more realistic mechanics and representation of tricks.  Reception  Mark McMorris Infinite Air has received mixed reviews from critics, varying between platforms. While critics agree that the level editors add plenty of replay value, some found the content at launch to be lacking. Other critics cited a steep learning curve involved in the physics-focused gameplay.

It is offering Junior High School (Grades 7-10) at present.http://www.sampaguitanhs.smartschools.com History Sampaguita Village National High School, once known as Sampaguita Village Barangay High School, was founded in 1977 through the Barrio High School Charter. It was created through the efforts of the officers of the homeowners association of Sampaguita Village through its president Feliciano Leyson. On its first year of operation, the school started with two first year and one second year classes with only four teachers. Classes, then, were held inside the compound of Sampaguita Village Elementary School under the supervision of the elementary principal. In 1979, a portion of the open space in Calendola Village was resolved for the perpetual use of the Sampaguita Village Barangay High School through a Municipal Resolution. In that same year, the school's first owned 3-classroom building was constructed and some of the classes were transferred in Calendola Village. After the construction of the second 3-classroom building in 1981 all classes from first to fourth year were held in the new school site in Calendola Village and in 1986 the school got its government recognition. In 1987 all barangay high schools were nationalized and with it the school's supervision was turned-over from the elementary principal to the newly designated Teacher-in-Charge. Consuelo L. Escudero, a math teacher, was designated Teacher-in-Charge in 1988 and became the first principal in 1995 to 2012. The independence of the newly nationalized high school from the supervision of the elementary principal gave way to the gradual improvement and development of Sampaguita National High School's physical facilities. From then on enrolment soared. Located in a new barangay, the school adopted the name Sampaguita, the National Flower, and the means of livelihood of most of the people of San Pedro. Because of the need for additional classrooms due to increase in enrolment, in 1991, a new 2-classroom building was acquired through the concerted efforts of the new school head, the PTA, and the Municipal Mayor, Calixto R. Cataquiz. The building was donated by Levis Strauss, Philippines and a 10% school share of the total building cost of Php 398,000.00 was shouldered by the school. The amount was raised from the donations of the different stakeholders of the school with the help of Mayor Calixto R. Cataquiz. The need for more classrooms increased because of massive increase in enrolment and more teachers were hired. From SY 2002-2003 up to SY 2004-2005, there was an enrolment overflow and the total number of classrooms can no longer accommodate the number of classes on a regular schedule, thus, shifting of classes in inevitable. To date there are two shifts of classes, 20 in the morning which starts at 6:00 a.m and 200 in the afternoon which starts at 1:00 p.m. In 2005 an extension of Sampaguita National High School was created in Adelina I Complex Subdivision in Barangay San Antonio to accommodate students from far flung areas of San Pedro. The creation of the school's extension was made possible through the initiative of Arturo L. Hatulan, the barangay captain of Barangay San Antonio with the support of the then municipal mayor Felicisimo A. Vierneza and Petronila S. Ilustrisimo, the District Supervisor. Sampaguita National High School Adelina I Complex Extension is on its fifth year of operation this year with 1,414 students divided into 22 sections, 7 first year, 6 second year, 5 third year, and 4 fourth year. The creation of the new school in Adelina Complex made enrolment in the main campus less crowded. Location Sampaguita National High School is located in Barangay Calendola, San Pedro, Laguna. The barangay is separated from the nearby subdivisions and other barangays by rivers. It is bounded in the north by ‚ÄúBuaya (Crocodile) Creek‚Äù where Barangay Sampaguita Village is located, in the east by San Pedro River where Villa Olympia and Harmony Homes subdivisions of barangay San Vicente are situated, in the south and western part is barangay Magsaysay separated by a small stream. Barangay Calendola Village is 3.2 kilometers away from the municipality of General Mariano Alvarez, Province Of Cavite in the south, 10.2 kilometers from Muntinlupa in the north, and 7.0 kilometers from Bi√±an proper in the east.

He was the vice-president of the Court of Appeal of the High Court and former chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) and commissioner on Interception of Communications and Surveillance. In the 2017 Chief Executive election, he received 21 votes in the 1,194-member Election Committee and lost to the eventual winner Carrie Lam. Education and legal career Woo was born in Shanghai Street, Yau Ma Tei, Kowloon in 1946 into a construction business family. He was educated at the Ying Wa College and graduated from the University of Birmingham with a bachelor's degree of laws in 1968 and University College London with a master's degree of laws in 1969. He said he wanted to be a lawyer after watching the film Witness for the Prosecution starring Charles Laughton. He was called to the English Bar in 1969 and the Hong Kong Bar in 1970. He served pupillage with Ronald Arculli. He was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1987. He was in private practice from 1970 to 1992. He became the head of the Department of Law & Business of Hong Kong Shue Yan College in 1986. He was appointed Judge of the Court of First Instance of the High Court in 1992 and Justice of Appeal of the Court of Appeal of the High Court in 2000. He was a Justice of Appeal of the Court of Appeal of the High Court and was appointed vice-president of the Court of Appeal of the High Court in 2004. He officially retired from the judiciary in January 2011 but continued to serve as deputy judge until 2016. Public career Between 1993 and 2006, he was the chairman of Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) which is responsible for running and supervising elections in Hong Kong shortly after Chris Patten became Hong Kong's last Governor and established the electoral organ. He handled the first three Chief Executive elections, which were won by Tung Chee-hwa and Donald Tsang, in which he had to face public scrutiny and also interpret election rules. He was criticised for allowing Tung to do his electioneering while still in office as Chief Executive in 2002. As a senior judge, he led a number of historic public independent inquiries, including the inquiry into the Garley Building inferno in 1996 and the chaotic opening of the new airport in 1998. In August 2006, Woo took up the post of Commissioner on Interception of Communications and Surveillance soon after retiring as the EAC chairman, in which he served until 2012. In March 2007, he was appointed by Chief Executive Donald Tsang as the head of the commission to investigate allegations over meddling with the academic freedom and autonomy of educational institutions involving the proposed merger of the Hong Kong Institute of Education and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He resigned after less than a week to avoid potential accusations of lack of impartiality due to his working relationship with Fanny Law, former Permanent Secretary for Education and Manpower. 2017 Chief Executive campaign Woo became the first candidate to declare his campaign on 27 October 2016. He launched an offensive campaign against incumbent Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, questioning his achievements during his term, while Woo himself was questioned for his lack of experience in public administration. On 14 December, Woo Kwok-hing unveiled his electoral platform under the slogan of \\"Righteous heart, righteous way, revert Hong Kong back to right track\\". He proposed to expand the voter base for choosing the Election Committee to one million in the 2022 Chief Executive election from the current 250,000, rising to three million by 2032 and eventually quasi-universal suffrage. His attendees included Andy Ho On-tat, former information coordinator during the Donald Tsang administration from 2006 to 2012. He later updated his platform adding the proposal of legislating Hong Kong Basic Law Article 22 which prohibiting mainland Chinese authorities for \\"meddling\\" in Hong Kong affairs as Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong Kong had been accused of meddling with the city's elections. Woo made an emergency plea for support after getting just three nominations on the first day of the nomination period. As the \\"Democrats 300+\\" planned to nominate John Tsang and Woo Kwok-hing to boost the competitiveness of the election against Beijing's favoured candidate Carrie Lam, Woo gradually received nominations from pro- democrat electors. Six electors from the Higher Education subsector including Civic Party founding chairman Kuan Hsin-chi became the first pro-democrats decided to nominate Woo on 15 February. 46 pro-democrat members from seven Election Committee also decided to nominate Woo on 18 February. After Tsang received enough nominations, pro-democrats turned to help Woo. On 27 February, Woo became the second candidate to be nominated, with 180 nominations in which almost all of them came from the pro-democracy camp. Woo received only 21 votes in the 1,194-member Election Committee in the final election, becoming the lowest votes a Chief Executive candidate ever had, as his pro-democrat nominators switched side to John Tsang in order to boost Tsang's chance of winning. Personal life Woo is the fourth child of the family. He has a sister named Wu Chiu-ha who is a kindergarten headmaster and a brother Woo Kwok-yin who is a lawyer. He is married to Rowena Tang Siu-ting, sister of Robert Tang, permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal. The couple has two sons and two daughters. His eldest son Alexander Woo married Yu Man-ying, daughter of entrepreneur Yu Ching-po, while his youngest son, Alan Woo, is also a lawyer.

Opened in 1865, the campground was used by Connecticut Methodists to partake in the 19th-century trend of religious and recreational camp meetings, and is now a secular community of summer homes. The campground was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 19, 1980. Description and history The New Haven District Campground is located on northwestern Plainville, on about of land northeast of the junction of Camp Street and Northwest Drive. It consists of a network of roads, entered via Gladding Avenue, that radiate to the north from Circle Avenue, at whose center is the main pavilion. The roads are otherwise densely built with small wood- frame cottages. All are one to two stories in height, and many feature gingerbread decoration typical of other camp meeting architecture. Despite their original purpose as revivalist gatherings, camp meetings became a popular leisure destination for the middle class in the 19th century due to their moral nature and affordability. The campground consists of 89 cottages, built as permanent replacements for the site's original tents, which surround a central preaching area in the camp meeting's traditional circular pattern. At the height of its popularity, the campsite had its own railroad station and spurred the local economy in what was at the time a rural area. The campground lost its religious affiliation in 1957, though the cottages are still used as summer homes.

Broussard (born September 18, 1940) is an American former basketball player known for his college career at Texas A&M; University between 1958 and 1962. Broussard was a three-time Southwest Conference Player of the Year, three-time first-team all-SWC selection, three-time All-American, and was later honored as one of the Southeastern Conference's Legends of Basketball. A native of Port Arthur, Texas, Broussard began to get noticed as a junior at Thomas Jefferson High School in his hometown. He led his school to win the Texas 4A state championship; the following season as a senior, he led them to be runners-up. Broussard enrolled at Texas A&M; in the fall of 1958. Due to NCAA eligibility rules at the time, freshmen could not play varsity sports until their sophomore years. When he became eligible in 1959‚Äì60, Broussard made an immediate impact. He averaged 17.9 points and 7.3 rebounds per game while leading the Aggies to a 19‚Äì5 overall record. The following year, Broussard averaged 22.4 points and 9.1 rebounds per game while leading Texas A&M; to a 16‚Äì8 record. His scoring average is still the fifth-highest single season average in Texas A&M; history. On January 16, 1961, he set still-standing school single game records for free throws made (19) and attempted (22, since tied) while playing against the Texas Longhorns. In his senior season in 1961‚Äì62, Broussard averaged 17.3 points and 8.5 rebounds per game. The Aggies finished with a 15‚Äì9 record. Despite his prolific college career, Texas A&M; never qualified for a postseason tournament. In none of Broussard's three varsity seasons did they finish worse than second place in the conference standings. His 1,382 career points and 596 career rebounds are still high in the Texas A&M; record books, as is his total free throws made (396, fourth most). After his college career ended, Broussard was selected in the 1962 NBA draft by the Chicago Zephyrs in the ninth round, although he never played professional basketball. In 2016, the Southeastern Conference selected him as one of their Legends of Basketball (the SEC recognizes much of the Southwest Conference's athletics history since most of the schools that were in the SWC eventually left for the SEC, thus disbanding the SWC in 1996).

The Act is divided into twelve sections.  Passage and revisions  The Act was first brought into force in 1963 and has undergone ten revisions since that time.  Effects  The passage of the Field Archaeology Act in 1963 impacted the practice of archaeology in Minnesota in several critical ways. It provided proscriptions related to the practice of archaeology, banned unlicensed practitioners from conducting archaeological investigations on state sites, and enacted penalties for violations of the Act. It also officially established the Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist, and outlined the licensing process and requirements for archaeologists seeking to work on state sites. In terms of physical archaeological remains and data recovered as a result of field archaeology, the Act explicitly granted ownership and title to the state.  Archaeological protection  The Act affords protection to state archaeological sites under Section 138.32, in that the state \\"reserves to itself the exclusive right and privilege of field archaeology on state sites, in order to protect and preserve archaeological and scientific information, matter, and objects\\".  Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist  The Act defines the position of the State Archaeologist, and dictates the lawful duties thereof. The Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist is charged with the following duties: * Acts as the agent of the state to enforce the Act. * Sponsors, engages in, and directs fundamental archaeological research. * Cooperates with agencies to preserve and interpret archaeological sites. * Encourages protection of archaeological sites on private property. * Retrieves and protects artifacts and data discovered on public property. * Retrieves and protects archaeological remains disturbed by agency construction. * Helps preserve artifacts and data recovered by archaeological work. * Disseminates archaeological information through report publication. * Approves archaeologist's qualifications for licensing to work on public property. * Formulates licensing provisions for archaeological work on public property. * Issues emergency licenses for archaeological work on public property. * Revokes or suspends archaeological licenses due to good cause * Approves curation arrangements of artifacts and data from state sites. * Repossesses artifacts from state sites that are not being properly curated. * Consults with the Minnesota Historical Society and Minnesota Indian Affairs Council regarding significant field archaeology. * Completes annual reports about the Office of the State Archaeologist's and licensees' activities. * Reviews and comments on agency development plans that may affect state sites  Archaeological licensing  The Act provides that any archaeological work conducted on non-federal public land in Minnesota, requires a permit issued by the Office of the State Archaeologist. There are four kinds of licenses, including * Yearly license for reconnaissance/Phase I survey. * Site-specific license for site evaluations/Phase II. * Site-specific license for major excavations/Phase III. * Site-specific license for burial authentications The State archaeologist provides a review and vetting of an archaeologist's qualifications, and forwards the application onto the Minnesota Historical Society for license issuance. * License Qualifications * License Application Forms and Information  Burial grounds  Burial grounds and cemeteries in Minnesota are governed by the Private Cemeteries Act.

They are generally extensions of the single-factor capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Model of Rosenberg and Marathe The multifactor equity risk model was first developed by Barr Rosenberg and Vinay Marathe.Rosenberg, Barr, and Vinay Marathe. The prediction of investment risk: Systematic and residual risk. 1975. Initially they proposed a linear model of beta r(i,t)-r(0,t)=b(i,t)[m(t)-r(0,t)+g(i,t) b(i,t)=sum_j X(i,j,t) f(j,t) + e(i,t) where r(i,t) is the return to equity asset I in the period [t,t+1], r(0,t) is the risk free return, m(t) is the market index return, e(i,t) is a market residual return and b(i,t) is a parameter fit by a time series regression over history prior to time t. Then X(i,j,t) are risk exposure values calculated from fundamental and technical data, f(j,t) are factor returns determined by a cross-sectional regression for each time period and g(i,t) are the regression residuals. This model was reformulated by Rosenberg et al. into a direct model of asset return, r(i,t)=sum_j X(i,j,t) f(i,j) + e(i,t) Here the factor returns f(j,t) and specific returns e(i,t) are fit by a weighted regression over each time period t for a representative asset universe. For instance the model might be fit over the 3000 highest capitalization US common stocks. The primary application of the model is to estimate the asset by asset covariance matrix C of asset returns by the equation C=XFX^t+D where F is the covariance matrix of asset returns, and D is a block diagonal matrix of specific returns. The matrix C is then used for Markowitz portfolio construction which involves maximizing the quadratic utility function u(h)=a^t h- k h^tCh subject to linear constraints on the vector of asset holdings h. Here a is a vector of expected returns and k is a scalar parameter termed the risk aversion. Modifications by Torre Nicolo G. Torre made a number of improvements to this framework which importantly sharpened the risk control achievable by these means.Rickard, John T., and Nicolo G. Torre. \\"Theory of optimal transaction implementation.\\" Signals, Systems & Computers, 1998. Conference Record of the Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on. Vol. 1. IEEE, 1998. In Rosenberg's model the risk indices X consisted of industry weights and risk indices. Each asset would be given an exposure to one or more industries, e. g. based on breakdowns of the firms balance sheet or earning statement into industry segments. These industry exposures would sum to 1 for each asset. Thus the model had no explicit market factor but rather the market return was projected on to the industry returns. Torre modified this scheme by introducing an explicit market factor (with unit exposure for each asset.) To keep the model identified by imposed the condition that the industry factor returns sum to zero in each time period. Thus the model is estimated as f(i,t)=m(t)+sum_j X(i,j,t)f(j,t) + e(i,t) subject to sum_k f(k,t)=0 for all t where the sum is over industry factors. Here m(t) is the market return. Explicitly identifying the market factor then permitted Torre to estimate the variance of this factor using a leveraged GARCH(1,1) model due to Robert Engle and Tim Bollerslev s^2(t)=w+a s^2(t-1)+ b1 fp(m(t-1))^2 + b2 fm(m(t-1))^2 Here fp(x)=x for x>0 0 for x<=0 fm(x)=0 for x>=0 x for x<0 and w, a, b1 and b2 are parameters fit from long time series estimations using maximum likelihood methods. This model provides a rapid update of market variance which is incorporated into the update of F, resulting in a more dynamic model of risk. In particular it accounts for the convergence of asset returns and consequent loss of diversification that occurs in portfolios during periods of market turbulence. In the risk model industry factors carry about half the explanatory power after the market effect is accounted for. However, Rosenberg had left unsolved how the industry groupings should be defined ‚Äì choosing to rely simply on a conventional set of industries. Defining industry sets is a problem in taxonomy. The basic difficulty is that the industry is defined by the members assigned to it, but which industry an individual equity should be assigned to is often unclear. Difficulties can be reduced by introducing a large number of narrowly defined industries, but this approach is in tension with the demands of risk estimation. For robust risk estimates we favor a moderate number of industries with each industry representing a few percentage points of market capitalization and not exclusively dominated by the largest company in the industry. Torre resolved this problem by introducing several hundred narrowly defined mini-industries and then applying guided clustering techniques to combine the mini-industries into industry groupings suitable for risk estimation. In the initial Rosenberg approach factor and specific returns are assumed to be normally distributed. However experience turns up a number of outlying observations that are both too large and too frequent to be fit by a normal distribution Although introduction of a GARCH market factor partly reduces this difficulty, it does not eliminate it. Torre showed that return distributions can be modeled as a mixture of a normal distribution and a jump distribution. In the case of a single factor the mixing model is easily stated. Each time period t there is a binary mixing variable b(t). If b(t)=0 then the factor return in that period is drawn from the normal distribution and if b(t)=1 it drawn from the jump distribution. Torre found that simultaneous jumps occur in factors. Accordingly, in the multivariate case it is necessary to introduce a multivariate shock vector w(i,t) where w(i,t)=0 if the multivariate mixing variable b(i,t)=0 and w(i,t) is drawn from the ith jump distribution if b(i,t)=1. A transmission matrix T then maps w from the shock space into the factor space. Torre found that the market, factor and specific returns could all be described by a mixture of normal returns and power law distributed shocks occurring at a low frequency. This modeling refinement substantially improves the performance of the model with regard to extreme events. As such it makes possible construction of portfolios which behave in more expected manners during periods of market turbulence. Extensions to other market types Although originally developed for the US equity market, the multifactor risk model was rapidly extended to other equity markets and to other types of securities such as bonds and equity options. The problem of how to construct a multi-asset class risk model then arises. A first approach was made by Beckers, Rudd and Stefek for the global equity market. They estimated a model involving currency, country, global industries and global risk indices. This model worked well for portfolios constructed by the top down process of first selecting countries and then selecting assets within countries. It was less successful on portfolios constructed by a bottom up process in which portfolios within countries were first selected by country specialists and then a global overlay was applied. In addition the global model applied to a single country portfolio would often be at odds with the local market model. Torre resolved these difficulties by introducing a two- stage factor analysis. The first stage consists of fitting a series of local factor models of the familiar form resulting in a set of factor returns f(i,j,t) where f(i,j,t) is the return to factor i in the jth local model at t. The factor returns are then fit to a second stage model of the form f(i,j,t)=sum_k Y(i,j,k) g(k,t) + h(i,j,t) Here Y gives the exposure of local factor (i,j) to the k^th global factor whose return is g(k,t) and h(i,j,t) is the local specific factor return. The covariance matrix of factor returns is estimated as \\\\mathbf{F= YGY^t + H} where G is the covariance matrix of global factors and H is the block diagonal covariances of local specific factor returns. This modeling approach permits gluing any number of local models together to provide a comprehensive multi-asset class analysis. This is particularly relevant for global equity portfolios and for enterprise wide risk management. The multifactor risk model with the refinements discussed above is the dominant method for controlling risk in professionally managed portfolios. It is estimated that more than half of world capital is managed using such models. Academic models Many academics have attempted to construct factor models with a fairly small number of parameters. These include: * Fama‚ÄìFrench three-factor model * Carhart four-factor model * Arbitrage pricing theory However, there is as yet no general agreement on how many factors there are.Harvey, Campbell R., Yan Liu, and Heqing Zhu. \\"...

Among the missing were Kenneth Martin, 54; his wife, Barbara Martin, 48; and their three daughters: Barbara \\"Barbie\\", 14; Virginia, 13; and Susan, 11. The family's eldest son, Donald, was in the United States Navy and stationed in New York during the time they vanished. Several months after their disappearance, the bodies of Susan and Virginia were discovered downstream on the shores of the Columbia River, roughly apart from each other. Police initially speculated the family's car may have crashed into the river, though the circumstances surrounding the event could not be fully explained. Further complicating the case was the discovery of a stolen handgun and the arrest of two ex-convicts in the area the day after the family's disappearance; investigators were unable to determine if the incidents were in any way connected. The whereabouts of Kenneth, Barbara, and Barbie remain unknown, and their vehicle has never been recovered. The family's disappearance has been described as one of the \\"most baffling\\" mysteries in Oregon history, and sparked the greatest manhunt the state had undertaken at the time. Disappearance On the evening of December 6, 1958, Kenneth and Barbara Martin of Portland, Oregon, attended a Christmas party before returning to their home at 1715 N.E. 56th Avenue in the Roseway neighborhood of northeast Portland. The couple had made plans for a day trip into the country for the following day. 1954 Ford Country Squire, the same year and model of the Martins' car In the late morning of December 7, Kenneth and Barbara left their home with their three daughters: Barbie, Susan, and Virginia, in their 1954 cream and red-colored Ford Country Squire station wagon. Barbie, the eldest daughter, was a freshman at Grant High School. The family's eldest son, Donald, then aged 28, was in the United States Navy and stationed in New York at the time. The family headed east for a drive into the Columbia River Gorge, where they intended to gather greenery to make Christmas wreaths and decorations. The knowledge of where the Martins were specifically throughout the day is sparse. Dean Baxter, gas station proprietor, reported that he encountered the family when they purchased of gasoline from his store in Cascade Locks around 4 p.m., approximately from their home in Portland. According to Baxter, he recalled their car continuing east after they had purchased gasoline. The family was seen again shortly after at the Paradise Snack Bar in Hood River, approximately east of Cascade Locks, where a waitress named Clara York stated she served the family. Other reports from passing motorists indicated that the family was seen in an unspecified location on the north bank of the Columbia River, in Washington state, at dusk. According to eyewitnesses who saw the family that day, Kenneth was reportedly wearing a tan zip-up jacket and dark slacks, while Barbara wore a navy blue coat, a plaid jacket, and a black print dress. Barbie was reportedly dressed in jeans with rolled cuffs and a beige coat. Investigation=Initial search efforts On December 9, Kenneth failed to report to his job at Eccles Electric Home Service Company, while Barbie was noted absent from her morning classes at Grant High School. Both Susan and Virginia were also reported absent by their teachers at Rose City School. The family was officially reported missing that evening by Kenneth's boss, Taylor Eccles. Police investigated their residence at approximately 11:00 p.m., searching for any signs of foul play. The house had been left undisturbed; a load of laundry was still in the washing machine, and dishes from the previous day were left on a drying rack in the kitchen; there was also a substantial amount of money in the Martins' bank accounts. Searches were undertaken by both Multnomah County and Hood River County police, but neither were able to produce substantial leads. A stolen white Chevrolet registered in Venice, Los Angeles, California was found in Cascade Locks the day of the Martins' disappearance, but was quickly dismissed by police as it did not match the Martins' vehicle. Also found near the site of the abandoned Chevrolet was a .38 Colt Commander handgun, which had been disposed of in the bushes, and was covered in dried blood. The handgun was turned over to law enforcement but never processed for evidence. The gun's serial number was traced to a Meier and Frank department store, and it was subsequently discovered that the gun had been among several sporting good items that the son Donald Martin had been accused of stealing while working at a Meier and Frank two years prior. Alleged sightings On December 8, Roy Light and another unnamed man both ex-convicts were arrested for car theft in Hood River County in connection with the abandoned Chevrolet, which raised suspicion in relation to the Martins' disappearance. A waiter at the Hood River restaurant where the Martins were last seen told law enforcement he saw Light (who was an acquaintance) and the other ex-convict in the restaurant at the same time; he also stated that the two men left at the same time the Martins did. Various other tips were submitted to law enforcement in the weeks and months following the family's disappearance, including over 200 letters and hundreds of phone calls. Among them were a report from an orchard owner east of Portland who claimed to have witnessed a man and woman on December 7, gathering greenery in a canyon where a Native American burial ground was located. He added that the following week, he noticed a flock of buzzards flying in this direction. The canyon was searched, but nothing was found. On December 28, 1958, a women's glove was discovered near the site of the abandoned Chevrolet, which family stated was \\"similar\\" to a glove Barbara \\"would wear\\"; however, it could not positively be identified as belonging to her. Days later, on December 31, a man called police reporting he had seen a vehicle matching the Martins' speeding on the Baldock Freeway. Police were alerted along the freeway, but the car could not be located. A letter was also received from a witness who claimed to have seen a family resembling the Martins in Burlington, Iowa on Christmas Eve. One of the last reported sightings of the Martins' vehicle came on January 7, 1959, from a truck driver who stated he had seen a car matching the Martins' description parked in Billings, Montana, with Oregon license plates. By February 1959, investigators had undertaken searches of various locations, including the greater Portland metropolitan region, as well as searches on Mount Hood. During this time, a volunteer searcher found tire tracks leading off of a cliff near The Dalles, which reportedly matched the tires on the Martins' Ford. Paint chips recovered at this location were sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for analysis, and it was determined that the paint was the same paint used on the make and model of the Martins' vehicle. Based on the possibility that the Martins' vehicle may have plunged into the river, the United States Army Corps of Engineers lowered the level of the river by in the lake behind Bonneville Dam, which was searched with sonar technology but yielded no results. Recovery of Susan and Virginia Virginia's body was discovered near Bonneville Dam (pictured), approximately from where the family was last seen On May 1, 1959, three months after the tire tracks were reported, a river drilling rig near The Dalles reportedly hooked something of substantial weight to its anchor; however, it became dislodged before it could be pulled to the surface. In the early morning hours of May 2, a fisherman and his wife reported seeing what appeared to be two bodies floating downstream near Cascade Locks; they later encountered them near Bonneville Dam. On the afternoon of May 3, the body of Susan was discovered on the north bank of the Columbia River, near Camas, Washington, roughly west of The Dalles. Her identity was positively confirmed via dental records. The following morning, May 4, the body of Virginia was discovered near Bonneville Dam, roughly west of The Dalles, also confirmed via dental records. Susan's body was taken to the Clark County medical examiner's office before being transferred to Multnomah County in Portland for autopsies on both bodies to be performed. One of the technicians who had taken fingerprints prior to the autopsies indicated to the medical examiner what they believed to be bullet holes in the heads of each of the girls' bodies; however, according to the medical examiner's report, no such injuries were found, and the cause of death for both of the girls was officially declared as drowning. Traces of metal, including aluminum, was recovered from Susan's clothing. Rupert Gillmouthe, the sheriff of Hood River County at the time, suspected that the drilling rig had overturned the Martins' car at the bottom of the river, and dislodged one of the doors, allowing the bodies of Susan and Virginia to escape and surface downstream. Further searches of the water were undertaken by both sonar and helicopter, but were unfruitful. The search for Kenneth, Barbara, and Barbie was subsequently suspended after a search diver nearly drowned. Aftermath and theories Police theorized that the family may have died as a result of Kenneth crashing their vehicle into the river, while another theory held that the family had been abducted and forced off of a cliffside into the river. In 1961, three years after the family's disappearance, a resident of Camas wrote a letter to The Oregon Journal stating that they were parked with a companion in Cascade Locks on December 7, 1958, and had witnessed a vehicle proceeding under the railroad tracks leading toward the locks. Moments later, they heard screaming, but upon investigating, found nothing. In December 1966, eight years after the family's disappearance, eldest son Donald‚Äîthe only surviving member of the family‚Äîinherited the family's \\"modest\\" estate, which had been in mandated probate for seven years. Multnomah County police consistently suspected foul play in the Martins' disappearance, based on the evidence of the tire tracks that indicated the family's vehicle was deliberately pushed from the cliff. Also troubling were the reported sightings of the family at dusk on the north bank of the river in Washington state, while the tire tracks placed them on the south side of the river in Oregon; this would suggest that their car would have fallen over the cliff after nightfall. The arrest of the two ex-convicts in the Hood River area the day after the family's disappearance, for car theft, was also noted, though police were unable to determine if the incidents were related. Walter Graven, a Portland detective who died in 1988, ardently felt the family had met with foul play, and that their murders would be solved once their car was discovered. The cremains of Susan and Virginia remained at the River View Abbey Mausoleum in Portland, unclaimed for over a decade after their deaths. On December 30, 1969, the urns containing their cremains were retrieved by an unknown individual. The girls' paternal grandmother, Margaret Martin, had died the day before, December 29, and the girls' cremains were claimed while funeral arrangements were being made for her. For most of the latter part of the 20th century, search efforts to recover the remaining three missing family members were not made. In July 1999, however, Oregonian journalist Margie Boul√©, who had become interested in the case, organized a dive search of the Columbia River near Cascade Locks, searching for the Martins' car. This search utilized new sonar, Global Positioning System (GPS), and lidar underwater acoustic technology, but ultimately proved unsuccessful. , the remains of Kenneth, Barbara, and Barbie remain undiscovered, and their vehicle has not been found.

It sold shares in teak plantations on guaranteed interests and later diversified to other schemes through four principal companies: Anubhav Agrotech, Anubhav Green Farms & Resorts, Anubhav Plantations, and Anubhav Royal Orchards Exports. The company suddenly closed down in 1998 when it could no longer pay its depositors, leaving its thousands of investors in the lurch and unpaid. Its chairman, C. Natesan, went underground and the other directors claimed ignorance and innocence. The incident became a major financial scandal in India. The company was subsequently revealed to have been a scam based on fraud, as teak, being an agriculture-based commodity, could not promise sure returns. Anubhav was found to have defrauded its depositors of nearly through Ponzi schemes. The Anubhav case is often termed by the Indian media as \\"The Great Plantation Scam of the 1990s\\". History The Anubhav group of companies was founded by C. Natesan, a commerce graduate from Chennai's Vivekananda College and a chartered accountancy course dropout. Natesan started his career in 1983 by launching a consultancy firm called Yours Faithfully Consultancy. In 1984, he started a construction company with three partners. Three years later, in 1987, he closed this venture and set up the Anubhav Foundation, which became the mother company of his future enterprises. Formation In 1991, as part of its post-liberisation process, the Indian government allowed firms within India to be formed as financial entities. Investment in agricultural commodities, which previously had only been permitted to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), was opened up to the private sector. In this environment, Anubhav Plantations Ltd. (Anubhav) was floated by Natesan as a listed public limited company in 1992. Over the next six years, the Anubhav umbrella expanded to include various other companies including Anubhav Homes Ltd., Anubhav Resorts Ltd., Anubhav Finance & Investments, Anubhav Communications & Advertising (Pvt.) Ltd., Anubhav Royal Orchards & Exports, Anubhav Hire Purchase Ltd., Anubhav Green Farms & Resorts (Pvt.) Ltd., Anubhav Agro, Anubhav Security Bureau, Anubhav Interiors and Anubhav Health Club. Under these companies, the Anubhav group owned and operated 254 finance firms, including 95 firms of Anubhav finance investments, 169 firms of Anubhav dhan varsha and one firm each of Anubhav Agro and housing developers. Furthermore, the plantation companies themselves had several companies under them. For example, Anubhav plantation had six companies operating under it, including Anubhav Good Earth Unit II, Anubhav Teak Deposit and Anubhav India Limited. By 1998, Anubhav group was worth , and, apart from its teak-plantation schemes, was involved in other enterprises including finance, real estate and timeshare ‚Äì a popular enterprise in the recently liberalized Indian economy of the 1990s. These companies were well-structured and backed by a nationwide infrastructure of 91 offices and over 1,800 employees. This included a young, aggressive and highly effective sales force. Modus operandi Anubhav investors were offered teak certificates or teak shares for investing anything upwards of . These investments were marketed under different confusing and complicated schemes that started to give returns each year of ‚Çπ1000 and bumper returns after 20 years to the tune of . While NABARD stated that only ‚Çπ20‚Äì30 was actually required to plant a teak tree, plantation firms such as Anubhav justified their charging nearly ten times this amount by including costs for security de-weeding and fertilisers. Further, Anubhav inflated the expected yield of timber by nearly twenty times the standard that had been generally observed by previous NABARD studies. In return, a teak plant would be planted on their behalf, which could be sold 20 years later. During these 20 years, the certificate would yield around 20% interest for the depositor, yielding returns of around ‚Çπ50,000 after 20 years. This was nearly triple the return offered by bank deposits. The company claimed that it owned teak plantations spread over of land, and floated attractive advertisements and plush offices, thus encouraging confidence among investors. Anubhav was not the first group to do this. During the early 1990s, teak plantations mushroomed in southern India, with 40 such companies registered in Madras and eight in Bangalore from January to September 1992. Most of these companies did not have adequate crop insurance and none of them were able to live up to their promises. All of them had skewed capital structures. The first attempt to promote private investment in teak plantations occurred in 1991, when a Hyderabad-based company, Sanghi Plantations, introduced a scheme offering investors teak trees at a nominal cost of ‚Çπ1,261 with what later turned out to be an unrealistic return of ‚Çπ50,000 after 20 years. Teak plantations typically take 50‚Äì60 years before yielding returns and are extremely susceptible to weather and the subtleties of the agricultural industry. They have rarely given dependable returns in India. However, in the light of general ignorance on the part of most laypeople, Anubhav entered this foray of marketing lucrative teak plantation schemes along with companies such as the Parasrampuria group, DSJ group and the Cochin-based \\"Sterling Tree Magnum\\", all of whom promised similarly large yet unrealistic returns. After the 1998 scam and subsequent investigations, CRISIL subsequently reported that on average, these teak plantation companies collectively had a promoter's contribution of just for every investor's share of ‚Çπ300 crore. Meanwhile, in interviews and announcements in news papers, Natesan unveiled future plans to forward-integrate from teak into furniture and to import machinery to make it. This led to a further increase in small investors. However, his growth strategy was focused mainly on mobilizing funds from investors rather than actually investing in plantations, plants, land and factories. The group had already raised vast sums of money to the tune of more than 400 crore rupees from the public in the form of fixed deposits, so-called \\"teak units\\", and a combination of fixed deposits and teak units. Natesan was extremely secretive about the financial performance of his group and this was never revealed to investors, who were happy as long as they received regular interest payments. Subsequent examinations of the company's accounts revealed that it was posting far higher incomes than its real profits. For example, in 1996‚Äì97, the company posted a net profit of ‚Çπ38.69 lakh (‚Çπ3,869,000) while its plantation income amounted to ‚Çπ35.32 crore (‚Çπ353,200,000). A total of nearly 3,500 teak plantation-based companies were set up in the 1990s in India, all promising interests to the tune of 21‚Äì24% when bank deposits gave an interest of just 5‚Äì7%. During its height in the mid-1990s, the Anubhav group was often described by the media as an example of a successful company (thus becoming a role model for about 530 other teak- and agro-based companies listed by SEBI that arose during that time and also subsequently defaulted, including Ballarshah teak plantations). The media also portrayed a larger-than-life image of Natesan himself. An ambitious man, Natesan's ostentatious lifestyle, his cars, and his plush office in Chennai's up-market Royapettah area were frequently cited by the media as examples of his lavish tastes. Natesan had also associated his company with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), thus garnering a positive image for his company. Scam of 1998 In January 1998, cheques issued by Anubhav to its investors began to bounce. Some investors reported that other than the first two payments, all the cheques had bounced. Most of these investors were middle class and retired Indian working-class people who had invested their savings in Anubhav. Their amounts varied between ‚Çπ15,000 and ‚Çπ50,000 per person. They included Indians from large commercial centers such as Mumbai as well as smaller cities and towns such as Pune, Shimla, Trichy and Sangli. On 2 December 1998, a letter was sent to all the investors of Anubhav group to come to the Woodlands hotel in Chennai to receive their long-due payments. When some of the investors landed at Anubhav's offices in Royapettah, they were met with locked doors. The company had closed down, with Natesan absconding. Some of these small investors were themselves on the brink of bankruptcy, having invested their life savings in the Anubhav group and its schemes. The letter that they had received had actually been sent by an advocate from a law firm that was following up the Anubhav group in response to court cases that had been filed against it. The letter invited them to come and check all the records and the balance sheet of the company. The event was covered by newspapers who reported that \\"...investors could be seen everywhere - sitting on the pavements, standing around the building, walking up and down the roads - all of them tense and worried.\\" Many depositors who went to the group's offices in Chennai and other cities to collect their deposit amount after maturity found the doors locked, and so lodged complaints with the police. Later, thousands of investors demonstrated in front of the company's headquarters in Chennai; however, by then, the main accused, Natesan, had already gone underground. Aftermath Anubhav was eventually found to have duped investors and depositors of over ‚Çπ400 crore. As details about what became known as the \\"Great Plantation Scam of the 1990s\\" began to be unveiled in the media, and it turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, Natesan's modus operandi shocked those who had held the Anubhav group in high regard. A government enquiry was subsequently launched into the Anubhav group. Its investigations revealed that the company had defrauded its investors through various plantation schemes, paying initial interests to old investors by simply channeling them from new investments by new investors. A liquidator, M. Ravindran, was appointed by the Madras High Court to try and repay its depositors at least in part. A number of investors formed their own city-based support and action groups to send in their claims, once such group being \\"The Pune Anubhav Investors' Action Committee (PAIAC)\\", formed by the 750-odd depositors of Pune who had collectively deposited ‚Çπ6 crore. Natesan, the chairman and managing director of the Anubhav Group of Companies, was subsequently caught by the police and placed in judicial custody, while the filing of the final chargesheet in his criminal case (No. 20501 of 1999) was delayed. The Madras High Court meanwhile issued a non-bailable warrant against S. Shreenivas Rao, one of the directors of the Anubhav Group of Companies. Rao had earlier moved court, requesting that the non-bailable warrant issued by additional chief metropolitan magistrate in Chennai be recalled, as he was director of Anubhav Agrotech and had nothing to do with Anubhav Plantations Ltd. In its proceedings, the High Court observed that Anubhav Agrotech Ltd. was one among the Anubhav Group, which, in January 1999, became Anubhav Agro Developers. The court observed that there was proof that Anubhav Plantation funds were diverted. The Anubhav teak plantation scam (often simply referred to as \\"The Teak Plantations Scam of the 1990s\\") is often included in the list of scams that occurred in post-liberalized India in the 1990s and has been called \\"The Great Plantation Scam of the 1990s\\". However, plantation-related frauds continue to occur in the country, with unsuspecting people lured by promises of high interests. A more recent case, that of Timber World Resorts and Plantations Ltd., which had been launched by a catering college graduate Ashwani Sud from Delhi, turned out to be a similar scam in 2009. Similarly, in 2012, hundreds of Gujaratis lost their money in a similar tree-plantation scam floated by the Ellisbridge (Ahmedabad)-based company \\"Golden Trees Plantation Ltd.\\" While the first to be unearthed, the Anubhav scam was not the largest agro-based scam in India. As per the SEBI, in the subsequent Pearls Agrotech scam, Pearls Agrotech Corporation Limited (PACL) collected from 5.85 crore (58,500,000) customers over 15 years by offering ambiguous investments linked to agricultural land and its development over a certain period of time. After seven years of judicial custody, Natesan was released on bail in 2007. Of the invested by small investors, the company ultimately refunded to 31,431 depositors. About has still not been refunded to 2,044 depositors.

In the 1990s, Sandell and Altg√•rd wrote the pamphlet Om retrogardism (\\"on retrogardism\\"), in which they advocated a literature rooted in traditional expressions.

Nathaniel Johnson Hone (died 1909) and his wife Emily Hone, n√©e Sandland (died 1914) who married in 1869. He was educated at Prince Alfred College, where he excelled at sports and academic subjects. He studied medicine at the University of Adelaide, graduated MB and ChB in 1894, winning the Everard Scholarship. Dr. Hone had his first practice in Morphett Vale, where he was appointed medical officer to aborigines and the destitute poor, and from 1903 in Semaphore, then established a specialist clinic in Adelaide in 1919. He was an honorary physician at the Royal Adelaide Hospital from 1921 to 1931 and was later for many years an honorary consulting physician. He was for many years a lecturer at the Adelaide Medical School, where he was highly regarded and popular. Around 1910 he was appointed chief Commonwealth Quarantine Officer for South Australia, an onerous position in the time before antibiotics when plague, smallpox and tuberculosis were serious threats to the community, and isolation in sanatoria was society's chief weapon. In 1924 there was only one pathology laboratory in the State, which meant long delays in diagnosis of infectious diseases in country areas. He established new facilities in Port Pirie, Mount Gambier and Renmark. He resigned this position in 1929, owing to pressure of his private practice, and the position was made full-time, with Dr. F. N. Ponsford the first appointee. He was interested in preventive medicine, and was involved in research into typhus disease, which was endemic among grain workers. In 1924 he was a member of the Commonwealth Royal Commission on Public Health, part of whose terms of reference was the division of responsibilities between Commonwealth and States. Most of the Commission's recommendations were introduced into Australian public health practice. Hone died after two weeks in intensive care in a Wakefield Street private hospital. Prior to this, he was said to be the oldest practising graduate of the Adelaide Medical School.

He is the fifth Governor-General of the Philippines from the Real Audiencia of Manila. Prior to being governor, Coloma served as senior auditor (oidor) in charge of military affairs during the administrations of Governor- General Diego de Salcedo to Manuel de Le√≥n. Career Little is known about the early life of Coloma, who was born in the La Rioja branch of the House of Coloma in 1617. He was a licentiate when he arrived in the Philippines on 29 March 1661 to serve as oidor (auditor) in the Real Audiencia. On 22 June 1662, Coloma married Mar√≠a de Cuellar y Cisneros in the Philippines. During the administrations of Governor-General Diego de Salcedo to Manuel de Le√≥n, Coloma held the position of senior auditor. As senior auditor, Coloma was in charge of military affairs. This position was challenged by Francisco Sotomayor y Mansilla, who was also part of the Real Audiencia, arguing that he was supposed to be the senior auditor. However, in fear of Salcedo, Sotomayor gave in to Coloma and assumed the second highest position. When a coup replaced Salcedo with Juan Manuel de la Pe√±a Bonifaz on 28 September 1668, the new administration had Sotomayor and the rest of the members of the Real Audiencia locked up outside Manila. The new governor and his associates seized Salcedo's fortune of 14,000 pesos and the situado brought by the Manila galleon amounting to 400,000 pesos for themselves. To circumvent the threat of Sotomayor, he was exiled from Cavite to Oton, Iloilo on 30 December 1668. While Coloma remained in the city, the associates of de la Pe√±a terrorized his wife so that he could not act on the matter. Meanwhile, the governor appointed two licentiates, Juan de Rosales and Eugenio Gutierrez de Mendoza, to decide on the seniority of Coloma and Sotomayor. However, it was beyond the knowledge of de la Pe√±a that King Charles II of Spain already appointed a new governor on 24 June 1668. He arrived in the Philippines by July 1669, and when he took office in Manila on 24 September of the same year, he put all those involved in the coup to trial. In 1670, he presided over the residencia of Salcedo, which was delayed by the coup two years ago. However, a protest was filed to the Council of the Indies regarding this review. Since he was senior auditor during the Salcedo administration, he was also the governor's asesor (legal adviser). All advice on the governor's acts came from Coloma. In essence, he would be reviewing his own acts. In 1671, Coloma's appointment to take the residencia was cancelled and Sotomayor took over Salcedo's residencia. As for Salcedo, he died while being transported to Mexico for trial. Coloma was with Governor de Le√≥n when the latter went to the convent of Tondo, Manila with full military display. This was done to influence the election of the provincial superior in the area, of which the leading candidate (Francisco de Medina Basco) was not in good terms with de Le√≥n. While still in the Philippines, his wife died. The governor, then suffering from excessive corpulency, visited the funeral of Coloma's wife. However, the smell of buried corpses made de Le√≥n's condition worse. Soon enough, his wounds reopened and he died of hemorrhage on 11 April 1677. On the same day, Coloma, then presiding over the Real Audiencia of Manila as senior auditor, succeeded as governor-general. One of the first acts of the Coloma administration was the disposition of de Le√≥n's estate, which amounted to 250,000 pesos. All of the former governor's fortune was allotted to charity, including 50,000 pesos for the Misericordia, 33,000 pesos for the founding of chaplaincies, 12,000 pesos for the rebuilding of San Lazaro Hospital in Santa Cruz, Manila, and another 12,000 pesos for rebuilding the seminary in Santa Potenciana. In 1668, eight thousand pesos were brought to New Spain but it was from the vandala of the rice production of Pampanga. The Kapampangan people appealed to Coloma for help, and in a landmark decision, the entire eight thousand pesos were returned to the people. Death On 25 September 1677, Coloma died and was buried in Santo Domingo Church. He was succeeded by Sotomayor. Up to this day, remains of Coloma's shield and coat of arms can be seen in Navarrete, La Rioja with the following inscription: ESTAS ARMAS SON DE FRANCISCO COLOMA, VIRREY Y CAPITAN GENERAL DE MANILA (This is the coat of arms of Francisco Coloma, Viceroy and Captain General of Manila). With no apparent heir, his will was carried out with money from his nephew, Pedro Coloma y Escalona, Marqu√©s of Canales de Chozas, marrie to married to Ana de Tapia y Z√∫√±iga. In 1675, two years prior to his death, Coloma's estate had been partitioned as follows: *12,000 pesos for Jer√≥nimo Campusano and his wife Juana de Cuadros *5,362 pesos to Nicol√°s de Merlo *5,085 pesos and jewelry to Do√±a Ana Mar√≠a Campusano *3,474 pesos for funeral expenses *1,424 pesos for payment of debts to Diego de Heredia, Pedro Rold√°n, and Joseph de Alecha *12,000 pesos and gold for Coloma's tomb  References  Category:Captains General of the Philippines Category:People of New Spain Category:1677 deaths Category:1617 births Francisco ","title":"Francisco Coloma y Maceda"},{"id":"52101251","text":"The Geological Museum is a component of the Natural History Museum in London, established in 1835.

The agency was established on March 20, 1974 through Presidential Decree No. 420 signed by then President Ferdinand Marcos. Under Sec. 1 of PD 420, it is the Commission's mandate to \\"promote and direct the accelerated development and continued growth of horse racing not only in pursuance of the sports development program but also in order to ensure the full exploitation of the sport as a source of revenue and employment\\". Under Sec. 3 of PD 420, the Commission's aims and objectives are: a. To promote, ensure, and maintain efficient and unbiased operation of racing, exclusive of the supervision of betting therein; b. To raise public confidence in the sport and to minimize infractions of the rules of racing; and c. To improve the breed of Philippine horses and to prevent illegal importation of race-horses. The supervision and regulation of the betting aspect of horseracing is handled by the Games and Amusement Board. In April 2016, Philracom was accepted as a member of the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities. History Horse racing in the Philippines The sport as practiced in the country is flat racing on dirt; there are no turf tracks in the Philippines. Horse racing in the Philippines had its origins during the Spanish colonial era. For a decade in the late 1860s to 1870s, members of prominent families held ‚Äúfun runs‚Äù, racing Philippine ponies on a quarter-mile (400 meters) straight course from San Sebastian Church to Quiapo Church. Organized purely for recreation, there was no official betting on these races. The races were held only once a year, in April or May, with tokens such as gold and silver medals, watches, or other ornaments as the prizes. Racing in the Philippines had its formal start with the establishment of the Manila Jockey Club in 1867 by 100 socio fundadores, members of prominent and affluent Spanish, Filipino, and English families of the time. The club's first racetrack was in Sta. Mesa. A more permanent structure. the San Lazaro Hippodrome, was built in Tayuman, Manila, where it stayed for decades until the track was transferred in 2003 to Carmona, Cavite, where it is now called the San Lazaro Leisure Park. In 1937, the Philippine Racing Club was founded by a group of Filipino and American investors. Their racetrack was Santa Ana Park, located at the boundary of Makati City and Manila. The track was moved to Naic, Cavite in January 2009, where it is now located within Saddle and Clubs Leisure Park. In 2013, horseowner Dr Norberto Quisumbing Jr. established Metro Manila Turf Club, Inc. in Malvar, Batangas. Establishment of Philracom Republic Act No. 309, An Act to Regulate Horse Racing in the Philippines, was promulgated in 1948. It established the Commission on Races which was mandated to supervise and regulate the sport. In 1950, Executive Order No. 392 signed by then-president Elpidio Quirino created the Games and Amusements Board (GAB). The duties and functions of the Commission on Racing as well as the Boxing and Wrestling Commission and \\"the Jai-Alai\\" [sic] were transferred to the newly-created GAB. Philracom was founded in 1974 to handle the growing Philippine Thoroughbred industry, which not only included racing among its activities but also breeding. Horses and feeds were increasingly being imported from abroad, and the Philracom regulated related processes and procedures. The duties and functions related to horse racing that had been with GAB were transferred to Philracom, except for supervision and regulation of betting which was a function retained by GAB as provided for in Sections 6, 11, 15, 18 and 24 of Republic Act No. 309, and by PD 420. The agency also implemented greater supervision over the conduct of the sport and wagering system, instituting live broadcast coverage of the races, photo patrol cameras, and other innovations of the time that protected the interest of the betting public. Leadership The Commission is presently composed of one chairman and six commissioners. All are appointive positions. Each commissioner represents a sector of the horse racing industry - horseowners, jockeys, trainers, and the racing public. The commissioners meet regularly to deliberate upon matters of policy, direct strategy, and formulate and amend Philippine horse racing rules and regulations. 1 March 2019 to present: Andrew A.

Programs Philracom Trainers Academy In 2015 the Commission, in order to professionalize the horse training sector, established the Philracom Trainers' Academy. It offers a two-year course for horse trainers. The Academy's administrators are veterinarians Dr. Ceferino Maala, member of the National Academy of Science and Technology, and Dr. Romy Modomo, equine medicine practitioner. In 2017, the Academy graduated its first cohort of trainers, which took the batch name 'First Impact'. Among their members are trainers Dr. Grace Sandoval and Dewey Santos. A second round of training will be opened in April 2019. The Academy is structured upon the 'educational cohort model', defined as \\"purposefully grouped students entering and pursuing a program of study together, characterized by social and cultural processes, shared experiences and interactions, collective efforts, and mutual commitment to an educational goal\\" (Horn, 2001; Maher, 2001, 2005; McPhail, 2000; Norris & Barnett, 1994; Yerkes, Basom, Barnett, & Norris, 1995). Specifically, the Academy follows the 'closed-cohort format', where students are \\"admitted as an identified group, and provided with a specific rotation of courses over a defined period of time\\" (Barnett & Muse, 1993; Maher, 2001, 2005).

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 84%, based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 6.72/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote that \\"[r]ather than being a film about an artist, it‚Äôs an attempt to show us what it's like to actually be an artist. [...] Don't Blink is directed by Laura Israel, Frank's film editor for more than 20 years, and includes generous selections from those works. Having a filmmaker that Frank is comfortable with in charge means that the photographer lets his guard down here more than he might have with a relative stranger.\\" Writing for The New York Times, A. O. Scott stated that \\"[Laura Israel's] film is less like a full biography than like a magazine profile, which is as it should be. You leave with a vivid sense of the man‚Äôs living presence and a reasonably thorough account of his life, work and associations.\\" A review for Variety thought the \\"unconventional editorial style [...] involving rapid-fire collages [...] often leaves one feeling aesthetically pummeled to the point of exhaustion, and portends only limited commercial appeal for the project outside die-hard Frank aficionados.\\" Box office As of 13 October 2016, the film has grossed $69,531 at the box office.

Most of Malaysia's alcohol production centres are located in East Malaysia as the non-Muslims population are mostly concentrated there. Alcohol in Malaysia refers to the consumption, industry and laws of alcohol in the Southeast Asian country of Malaysia. Although Malaysia is a Muslim majority country, the country permits the selling of alcohol to non-Muslims. There are no nationwide alcohol bans being enforced in the country, with the exception of Kelantan and Terengganu which is only for Muslims. The Islamic party there respect the rights of non-Muslims with non-Muslim establishments like Chinese restaurants and grocery shops being excluded from such bans. The federal territory of Kuala Lumpur has the highest alcohol consumption in the country, followed by the states of Sarawak in second place and Sabah in third place. Based on a report released by International Organisation of Good Templars (IOGT) in 2016, Malaysia has the third highest tax on alcohol worldwide at 15%, behind Norway and Singapore which are predicted to keep increasing. The country has the 10th largest population of alcohol users worldwide, with an annual spending of RM2 billion on alcoholic drinks. Prior to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Malaysia together with Vietnam plans to drop import tariffs on beer, whiskey and other alcoholic drinks.  History and tradition  Jars for the making of the traditional rice wine of tapai in Sabah. The history of local alcoholic drinks in the country are mostly concentrated in the island of Borneo as the indigenous people in the island have been traditionally drinking a home-made rice wine called tuak and tapai in their communal gatherings and harvest festivals of Gawai Dayak and Kaamatan. The consumption in the Malay Peninsula meanwhile are less since the Malay sultanates there adheres to Islamic principles regarding to alcohol. But following the arrival of alcoholic drinks from the Western world to Malay Archipelago in the 17th century when European colonial merchants began to come in contact with the people in the archipelago, some local Malay population start to taste wine brought by the Portuguese and Dutch and this was continued until the arrival of British until the 19th and 20th centuries. The arrival of Indian labours in British plantations during the colonial times marks the introduction of \\"toddy\\" production by the Indian community, as well with the arrival of Chinese labourers on British mines who produce and introduce their own alcoholic drink such as \\"samsu\\" to the local community. The British also brought their own drinking traditions with the introduction of beer and stout. In the 1930, the first brewery was established in neighbouring British Singapore.  Industry and products  Since the British colonial times, Tiger Beer was the first commercial beer brewed in 1932 by Malayan Breweries Limited, a Singapore-based brewery which was formed from a merger between Heineken and Fraser and Neave (F&N;). The beginning of alcohol productions in Malaysia start in 1968, when two leading breweries of Guinness and Malayan Breweries merged to form a new company known as Guinness Anchor Berhad. In 1970, Carlsberg established its first brewery outside Kuala Lumpur. Both are since the only legal commercial breweries in Malaysia, which account for 95% of the total beer and stout volume in the country market. In 2007, another two breweries known as Napex and Jaz brewed beer for pubs in the country, but both have since ceased from operation. Beside local productions, many alcoholic drinks in the country are also imported from neighbouring countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam.  Regulation  Giant Supermarket of Sabah. Alcohol is generally prohibited for Muslim consumers in the country as Malaysia's sharia law forbids Muslims from drinking alcohol. Alcohol is mostly banned for Muslims in the states of Kelantan and Terengganu. The legal drinking age for Malaysia is 21 years old and above, which was officially changed from the previous legal drinking age of 18 with effect from 1 December 2017. However, the enforcement on the new legal drinking age of 21 was held back until 16 October 2018. The legal limit for alcohol while driving in Malaysia is 80 milligrams per decilitre or 100 millilitres. Any vendors, restaurants and retailers need a licence to serve or sell tap/draft beers, liquor and spirits in the country, but bottled and canned beers are exempted from such licence requirements which is why it is common to find many vendors and coffee houses continue to serving alcohol in their premises without any licence throughout the country. Malaysia also impose a nationwide regulations for vendors to place their alcoholic drinks into separate refrigerators or storage places, although this was opposed by certain vendors in the state of Penang. The high tax on alcohol has led to the increase price of alcoholic drinks in Malaysia, this has contributed to alcohol-related harm as many indigenous in the interior turning to unsafe alcohol being smuggled in from neighbouring countries. In 2018, around 45 people died in the country's worst methanol poisoning involving foreign workers and several Malaysians due to the consumption of cheap fake liquors acquired from the country's black markets.

It was suppressed by the British Government the same year. History From 1845, John Mitchel had been invited by Charles Gavan Duffy, co-founder and first editor of The Nation (a paper supporting Daniel O'Connell's Repeal Association) to write for that paper. He became part of the Young Ireland movement and after the schism in the Repeal Association, he formed the Irish Confederation, with Thomas Reilly, William O'Brien and led by Thomas Meagher. Dissatisfied with his lot at The Nation, he favoured a more \\"vigorous policy against the English government\\" and resigned in 1847. From his office at 12 Trinity Street, Dublin, he printed and published the first issue of the United Irishman on 12 February 1848. Other Young Ireland contributors included John Martin, Thomas Devin Reilly and the nationalist Roman Catholic priest, John Kenyon. The contents included articles and letters citing public grievances (which were discussed in Parliament), promoting Irish independence, and reporting the general European unrest of the time, including the Chartist movement in Great Britain. On 24 February, Edward Smith-Stanley, then known as Lord Stanley, highlighted the United Irishman in the House of Lords and quoted Mitchel's published \\"letter\\" to the Earl of Clarendon, George Villiers, which he claimed fomented sedition. On 21 March, O'Brien and Meagher were charged with making seditious speeches and Mitchel was charged with publishing three seditious articles in the United Irishman. Mitchel's words - saying that he was guilty of sedition and wanting to overthrow the Government - were quoted by George Grey in the first reading of the Crown and Government Security Bill in House of Commons on 7 April. An article by Gavan Duffy in The Nation was quoted in the same speech as being of seditious nature. Mitchel was finally arrested. In the U.K. Parliament, a new crime of treason felony had been proposed and royal assent granted in April. Mitchel was duly charged with this crime. In the Commission Court on 22 May, after the Clerk of the Crown queried the foreman of the jury who said the bill against Mitchel was for \\"Sedition\\". The foreman replied, to laughter, \\"For treason, felony or whatever it is - I know not.\\" On Friday, 26 May, Mitchel was found guilty and was the following day sentenced to transportation for 14 years to Van Diemen's Land. Sixteen issues of the United Irishman had been printed. The last was on 27 May 1848 and covered at length Mitchel's court case and conviction. It included Mitchel's final conribution, penned in Newgate Prison. After that issue, the Government seized the printing materials and suppressed further publication of the paper. In June, Martin printed and published The Irish Felon, a successor newspaper from the same Dublin office, honouring subscriptions to its predecessor. Martin suffered the same fate as Mitchel on 18 August.

Her new name refers to Admiral John Colpoys. She first traded between London and the Caribbean. Between 1802 and 1807 she made three voyages transporting slaves from the Gold Coast to the Americas. After the abolition of the British slave trade in 1807 she became a merchant vessel. Then in 1813 new owners turned her towards seal hunting. She made four complete voyages to South Georgia before she was wrecked in 1817 during her fifth seal hunting voyage. Merchantman Admiral Colpoys first appears in Lloyd's Register for 1801 with Disney, master, Atkins & Co. as owners, and London-Bermuda as trade. The same entry shows her master as changing to G. Musson, and her trade to London-Jamaica.Lloyd's Register (1801), ‚ÑñA106. Lloyd's Register for 1802 continues to show Musson and Jamaica.Lloyd's Register (1802), ‚ÑñA125. Slave trading Owners Thomas King & Co. deployed Admiral Colpoys on three slaving voyages.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database voyages: Admiral Colpoys. For each of her voyages Admiral Colpoys went to the Gold Coast to gather her human cargo. First voyage (1802): under George Adams, master, she left London on 17 November 1800. She delivered the slaves to Havana in September 1802. She had embarked 319 slaves and landed 287, for a loss rate of 10.0%. She arrived back at Portsmouth on 22 December from Havana after a voyage of five weeks and three days.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, p.519. Second voyage (1805): under Henry Coley, master, Admiral Colpoys left London on 2 October 1804, bound for the Gold Coast. She started gathering slaves at Cape Coast Castle and then Accra, beginning on 7 February 1805. She delivered the slaves to Demerara on 10 June. She had embarked 337 slaves and landed 303, for a loss rate of 10.1%. She left Demerara on 26 July and arrived back at London on 30 September. Third voyage (1807): on 20 January 1807 Richard Coaley received a letter of marque for Admiral Colpoys. She sailed from London on 9 February 1807, bound for the Gold Coast. She gathered her slaves at Cape Coast Castle, Lagos, and Tantumquerry. She arrived at Demerar on 30 September. She had embarked 326 slaves and she landed on 293, for a loss rate of 10.1%. The Essequebo and Demarary Royal Gazette for 3 October 1807 had two items concerning Admiral Colpoys.Essequebo and Demarary Royal Gazette, Vol. 2, No. 92, 3 October 1807. Accessed 23 October 1807. > \\"The Subscribers inform their Friends who Commissioned them to Purchase > Negroes in Barbados, that they have received by the Ship Admiral Colpoys, > Capt.

Colin Macrae, & Underwood, > Johnson & Co.. Demerary, 3d October 1807.\\" Admiral Colpoys arrived back at London 24 April 1808. Merchantman In 1807 the British Parliament passed an Act for the abolition of the slave trade. However this act merely imposed fines that were insufficient to deter entrepreneurs from engaging in such a profitable business. A number of Liverpool slave traders continued the trade via various subterfuges (see, for example, the case of Donna Marianna). Lloyd's Register for 1808 still shows Admiral Colpoys with R. Cooly, master, King & Co., owners, and trade London- Africa.Lloyd's Register (1808), ‚Ññ139. So does Lloyd's Register for 1809; it also shows a new master, Venables, replacing Cooly. However, Lloyd's Register was only as accurate as the owners of the vessels chose to make it by updating their information. It is therefore not clear whether Thomas King & Co. continued to trade slaves or not. Given that she retained her name and all subsequent merchant voyages had her sailing to British Guiana, she most probably did not. Lloyd's Register for 1810 shows Admiral Colpoys with Venables, master, King & Co., owners, and trade London-Demerara.Lloyd's Register (1810), ‚ÑñA135. The Slave Trade Felony Act 1811 was passed to stiffen the legal sanctions against those engaged in the slave trade. Transgression became a felony with a punishment that could involve imprisonment or transportation. Seal hunting Lloyd's Register for 1813 continues the entries from 1810, but shows a new master, Toderage, replacing Venables. Toderage appears to be a misspelling for Todrig. All of Admiral Colpoyss sealing voyages saw her sailing to South Georgia while under the command of James Todrig, and under the ownership of \\"Todrig\\", or James and Francis Todrig. On her first whaling voyage, Admiral Colpoys left England on 2 July 1813, and returned on 31 May 1814. On her second, she left on 21 July 1814, and returned on 9 May 1815. On her third, she left in 1815, and returned on 23 March 1816 with 400 casks and 12 skins (presumably seal). She had left St Helena on 5 March 1815 in company with and , both trading with India under a license from the EIC.\\"LLOYD'S MARINE LIST‚ÄîMAY 9. 1815\\". Caledonian Mercury (Edinburgh, Scotland), 13 May 1815; Issue 14575. On her fourth voyage, she left in 1816 and returned on 27 January 1817. Fate On her fifth whaling voyage, Admiral Colpoys sailed to South Georgia via Santiago, Cape Verde. She was lost on 28 November 1817 when an iceberg floated into the bay in which she was anchored and pushed her onshore.British Southern Whale Fishery Database ‚Äì voyages: Admiral Colpoys. Her crew was saved.Lloyd's List (27 March 1818), ‚Ññ5266. The crew was able to save 700 barrels of elephant oil that were transhipped to England. However, 800 barrels of elephant oil were lost. Another account reports that the iceberg severed Admiral Colpoyss cable; attempts to break up the iceberg using cannon fire were unable to prevent Admiral Colpoys from drifting on to the rocks. Francis Todrig, in King George, retrieved the crew.

During the break-up of Gondwana around 180‚Äì165 Ma, the opening of the Weddell Sea lead to extension along the western margin of the South American Plate, resulting in intra-plate volcanism in the Chon Aike area and rifting in the Magallanes Basin. The Chon Aike volcanism was probably related to the subduction of the Pacific Phoenix and Farallon plates.

Work Rissa, Das Geheimnis, 1966 Rissa, Rosenengel, 1992 Rissa's representational painting is characterized by stylistic reduction and the emphasis on volume and form. From the mid-1960s, she developed a style that did not achieve volume through color transitions and light-dark gradations. Forms are divided into individual color areas, which are placed next to each other and only when viewed from a distance give a spatial effect as well as a higher degree of abstraction. References to Informalism are produced by brush strokes that break through individual color areas.Rissa-Ausstellung Villa Wessel 1996 in Iserlohn Rissa's themes are sexuality and eroticism, emancipation, environmental threats and the animal world. At the beginning of the 1990s her work also changed to topics such as the Gulf War and Islam. For example, the artist painted veiled Bedouin men and women ('W√ºstensohn', 1991; 'W√ºstentochter', 1993).Rissa. Gem√§lde und Zeichnungen, edited by Walter Smerling.

Biography Federico Craveri studied chemistry and meteorology at the University of Turin. In 1840 he moved to Mexico, which had recently gained independence from Spain. From 1840 until 1859 he taught chemistry at the National Museum in Mexico City. In Mexico, he obtained a graduation in Chemistry and Pharmacy. In 1847 he was joined in Mexico for two years by his brother Ettore, who shared similar interest in nature. Federico Craveri explored this country for a few years (1855-1857) to study its geology, with particular regard to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. In Mexico as well in the United States Federico Craveri collected specimens of many animals and plants. These collections were placed, on his return to Italy, in the family home of Bra. For thirty years he took care of the classification of the material brought back from his travels, that included an extensive collection of birds notably hummingbirds.Comune Bra Until his death he taught at the University of Turin. The private collections of the Craveri family were donated to the town of Bra and now they are kept at the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale Federico ed Ettore Craveri, which bears the name of both brothers.Langhe - Museo Civico di Storia Naturale Federico ed Ettore Craveri Part of the collections are also kept in the Museum of Natural History in Turin. Travels Federico Craveri accomplished three voyages of discovery in Northern and Central America. Following a mandate conferred by the Mexican government, in 1855 he first explored the islands of the Gulf of California in search of guano then used as organic fertilizer. He explored the mining region of Sinaloa succeeding in finding some new mines. The following year he explored the coasts of the Pacific and the Islands of Baja California, until then little known and virtually uninhabited, but rich in birds and marine mammals. He discovered a new island to which he gave the name of Elide, in memory of his first tormented love. He returned to this island in 1857, taking possession in the name of the Mexican Government. Then he made a second expedition to the mining region of Sinaloa.Biologia Marina ‚Äì La scoperta di Baja California Ettore Craveri In 1858 Federico Craveri left for San Francisco, went to Vancouver Island and sailed up the Fraser River. Finally he made an exploratory trip to the gold-mining region of California. In 1859 he reached Panama and then Cuba. He went up the Mississippi to Saint Paul. He sailed on the Great Lakes and reached the Niagara Falls. He then visited New York, Washington and Boston and finally on September 11, 1959 he returned to his father's birthplace in Italy, Bra, after 19 years of absence. During his travels, Craveri also discovered a new species of murrelet (Synthliboramphus craveri), which in 1865 was described, named and dedicated to Federico Craveri and Ettore Craveri by the ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori, in acknowledgment of the fact that the Craveri brothers had enriched the Turin Museum of Natural History with many species of birds of Mexico and California.Storrs L. Olson The name of the Craveri Brothers' Murrelet Department of Vertebrate Zoology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. 20560 This bird is now known in North American literature as Craveri's Murrelet. The name of the Italian naturalist Craveri is also borne by an extinct crab (Retropluma craverii), an extinct turtle (Testudo craverii) and an extinct cephalopod mollusk (Sepia craverii), from the tertiary period of Piedmont. Various species of Mexican diptera were dedicated to his brother Ettore Craveri (Tipula craverii, Tabanus craverii, Mallophora craverii and Diogmites craverii).Luigi Bellardi - Saggio di ditterologia messicana - Memorie della Reale accademia delle scienze di Torino Insect collections General Insecta collections from Italy and Mexico collected by Frederico and Ettore are held by Museo Civico di Storia Naturale \\"Federico ed Ettore Craveri\\" (Bra) ; Coleoptera from Mexico are held by Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova ; Diptera from Mexico are in the Luigi Bellardi, collection in Museo Regionale di Scienze Naturali di Torino.

He was one of Beethoven's earliest friends in Vienna, and remained so for the rest of the composer's life. From 1806, when Beethoven broke relations with Prince Lichnowsky, most of his chamber music was first played in Zmeskall's house. There are more than 100 letters and notes from Beethoven to Zmeskall, the last written a month before the composer's death.

He was known around Liverpool in the early 1960s as Brian Epstein's \\"right-hand man\\".  Early years  Born in 1933, Booth grew up in Moreton and was a wartime schoolboy. In 1948, at the age of 15, he won a scholarship in commercial art and design at the Wallasey School of Art and Crafts in Wallasey, Merseyside. After only 18 months at art school, he was offered his first position in a local commercial art studio which was also a printing, sign-writing and poster-writing company.  Working for The Beatles and Brian Epstein  During the early 1960s, Booth worked in Liverpool City Centre, near to The Cavern Club and right next door to The Beatles manager Brian Epstein's office. Booth did a lot of business with Epstein, producing posters, printed leaflets and a wide variety of publicity and display material. Booth produced hand-painted gig posters during the early sixties for many promoters, including Epstein, Sam Leach, Allan Williams and Cavern Club DJ -Bob Wooler. Booth would hand-paint many of the same poster using one- stroke brushes and liners with oil-based colours, mostly on white machine glazed 'double-crown' 30\\"x20\\" poster paper. If Epstein required a larger number of posters for a specific event, then the original artwork would be sent to a local silk-screen printer for bulk printing and distribution and the same artwork was often used for leaflets and press adverts. Very few of Booth's 1960s original posters have survived, as the posters would normally be disposed of after the event or destroyed during the silk-screen printing process, but today at auction, the printed posters that have survived are sold to collectors for ¬£6,000 or more. Christie's of London sold one of Booth's original hand-painted Cavern Club posters to an American collector for ¬£27,500, which was double Christie's valuation.  The Cavern Club  During the late fifties, before his publicity artwork for The Beatles, Booth hand- painted many posters for The Cavern Club on Mathew Street, Liverpool. When it first opened as a Jazz Club in 1957, 'The Merseysippi Jazz Band' were the big attraction on opening night, supported by The Wall City Jazz Men. He created posters for the club's opening night. The Cavern Club always had plenty of Booth's posters pasted on the walls outside, when The Beatles and other groups were playing there. In October 2016, Booth was commissioned to produce the artwork for The Cavern Club's 60th Anniversary and this is now on display inside the club.  Later work  In early 2016, BBC1 aired a short documentary on Booth on their Inside Out TV show. In August 2016, Booth held an exhibition at The View Two Gallery in Liverpool as part of International Beatleweek Festival 2016. This was the very first time all of Booth's posters had been on display under one roof.  Death  Booth died from cancer on 11 January 2017 in Upton, Merseyside, aged 83.

Principal photography began in late-June 2016. Major filming locations were Fort Cochin and Sri Lanka. The movie grossed 50 crore at the box-office. Plot The film opens with the death of the last Malabar Jew in Cochin. An antique seller steals antique items including a strange looking box with Jewish inscriptions from the Jew's house. An unseen force from the box mauls and kills a worker in his shop at night. A.C.P Shafeer Ahammed (Tovino Thomas) is assigned the case but is unable to reach a lead. Ranjan Mathew (Prithviraj Sukumaran), a nuclear waste management specialist based in Mumbai, is transferred to Kochi with wife Priya Raghuram (Priya Anand). Being both a Marathi and a Malayali, Priya finds it hard to adjust to the shift from Mumbai to Kerala. On a retail therapy, Priya buys the strange box from the antique shop. Upon opening it, paranormal experiences begin. Ranjan's uncle Father Samuel (Vijayaraghavan), who had looked after Ranjan as an orphan, is invited to Ranjan's house. Samuel feels that something is amiss and he tells Ranjan that the box from the antique shop is a Dybbuk box, with the name ‚ÄúAbraham Ezra‚Äù written on it in Hebrew. At his behest, Ranjan finds more about the Dybbuk from a Rabbi David Benyamin (Babu Antony) in Mumbai. He tells Ranjan that the Dybbuk only possesses people without mental stability or children under 3 years, and whoever exorcises the Dybbuk becomes its worst enemy. The next day, Rabbi Benyamin dies and Ranjan learns that Priya is pregnant and realizes his child will be possessed by the dybbuk. Ranjan requests Rabbi Benyamin's son, Rabbi Marques (Sujith Shankar) for help. Marques arrives in Kochi and finds the Dybbuk is named Abraham Ezra. Ranjan and Marques find an ex-Jew named Joshua Yehudi, a former friend of Marques' father, and get a historical book from him, which reveals the story of Abraham Ezra in 1941 in Thiru-Kochi. The film moves to the historical era, where a rich Jewish boy Abraham Ezra (Sudev Nair) and a poor Christian girl Rosy (Ann Sheetal) fall in love during Ezra's visits to Thiru Kochi, and eventually Rosy becomes pregnant. Rosy is not able to tell Ezra that she is pregnant. Ezra's father Yakoob Ezra refuses to let him marry Rosy, since she is not a jew. Rosy does not reveal Ezra is her unborn child's father. Months later, depressed Ezra writes to Rosy telling her to end the relationship and Rosy commits suicide. Rosy's father finds Ezra's letter and he with the villagers confronts the father-son duo when they arrive in Thiru Kochi. In the ensuing scrimmage he is killed and Ezra is left paralysed. When the doctors said that Ezra will be in this state for the rest of his life, Yakoob decides to take revenge on the town using black magic. He euthanises and puts his son's soul into a Dybbuk box, which on opening will release Ezra's spirit that will possess and destroy. A wooden dummy is buried in place of Ezra's body. Yakoob takes the corpse and dumps it in the sea. Thus is created the Dybbuk box which eventually finds its way to Ranjan. The story comes back to Ranjan. Marques and Samuel take Shafeer into confidence, both confirm that Abraham Ezra's story is true by exhuming the wooden mannequin. The film then takes a twist when it is revealed that it is not Priya, but Ranjan who has now been possessed by the spirit when Ranjan would be searching for Priya one night. Fr. Samuel tells them that Ranjan, as an orphan had mental problems. Hence he was probably vulnerable to the Dybbuk. It is understood that the spirit left Priya and possessed Ranjan when it noted that Ranjan handles Nuclear waste and he could be controlled into using that to destroy the city. At last, Ranjan is exorcised and the dybbuk is sent back into the box by Marques, using Jewish exorcism rituals. The box is then taken to the ocean by Marques and Shafeer and dumped, just as Ezra's body was disposed. Later, Priya gives birth to a healthy baby and she and Ranjan share the news with Marques. In a mid-credit scene, the Dybbuk box is found by two young men along the seashore. They carry it away, planning to open it.

The fruit is a woody, cylindrical to barrel-shaped or cup-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel usually long. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus captiosa was first formally described in 1993 by Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper and the description was published in the journal Nuytsia from a specimen near Jerramungup. The specific epithet (captiosa) is a word Latin meaning \\"deceptive\\", referring to the fine leaves, which are very different from those of the related E. incrassata. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt grow in sandy and gravelly soils in heath between Tambellup and Jerramungup in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. Conservation status Eucalyptus captiosa is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Mission Growth Energy describes its mission as representing \\"the producers and supporters of ethanol, who feed the world and fuel America in ways that achieve energy independence, improve economic well-being, and create a healthier environment for all Americans now.\\" Issues=Renewable Fuel Standard Growth Energy strongly supports the Renewable Fuel Standard. In a written statement, Tom Buis, co-chairman of the group, said, \\"‚ÄúThe RFS is the only meaningful policy to help break Big Oil‚Äôs stranglehold on the liquid fuels marketplace. This is an energy policy that is working. It is doing exactly what it was intended to do, with great success. It is irresponsible to rely solely on fossil fuels, and we should not put all our eggs in one basket when it comes to our national and energy security. The bottom line is that ten years after the RFS, Americans across the country are celebrating and recognizing a decade of job creation, rural economic revitalization, clean air, innovation, and increased energy independence and consumer choice.‚Äù Corporate Average Fuel Economy/Greenhouse Gas standards Speaking of comments submitted by Growth Energy on a Technical Assessment Report on Corporate Average Fuel Economy/Greenhouse Gas (CAFE/GHG) standards, a spokesman said, ‚ÄúOur comments highlight the wealth of available research that outlines the vital role that affordable, higher blends of ethanol can play in helping automakers achieve increasing future GHG and CAF√â standards. Furthermore, we encourage the agencies involved in this review to not only acknowledge the important role higher blends can play, but ensure they are part of the larger goal in achieving greater efficiency and a reduction in harmful emissions.\\" Market access Increasing consumer access to ethanol is a key issue for the organization. One of the ways Growth Energy does this is by increasing access to ethanol-gasoline blends with higher amounts of ethanol than the standard E10. The organization's \\"Prime the Pump\\" program encourages retailers to sell E15, containing about 15% ethanol. Their efforts face a number of challenges. First, many states, such as California, prohibit the sale of E15. Second, regulations on Reid vapor pressure often prohibit the sale of E15 to non-flexfuel cars during the summer. Leadership=Emily Skor Emily Skor became Growth Energy's CEO in 2016. Before joining Growth Energy, Skor was vice president for communications at vice president of communications at the Consumer Healthcare Products Association (CHPA). She also served as the CHPA Educational Foundation's executive director. Skor was born in Minnesota, where ethanol is an important industry. Skor replaced Tom Buis as CEO. Awards Growth Energy presents an annual \\"Fueling Growth\\" award to members of the United States Congress.

These factors contribute to psychological resilience in emerging adults and adults.  Contents  The SPF consists of twenty-four statements for which individuals are asked to rate the degree to which each statement describes them. The SPF assesses a wider range of protective factors than other scales. The SPF is the only measure that has been shown to assess social and cognitive protective factors. The SPF includes four sub-scales that indicate the strengths and weaknesses that contribute to overall resilience. The SPF is the only measure to have been used in measuring resilience in sexual assault survivors within the United States.  History  The SPF was developed by Elisabeth Ponce-Garcia at the science of protective factors laboratory (SPF Lab) to capture multiple aspects of adult resilience. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis was subsequently published as collaborative research. The SPF was found to assess resilience effectively in both men and women, across risk and socio-economic status, and ethnic/racial categories. In order to verify effectiveness in comparison to other measures, Madewell and Ponce-Garcia (2016) analyzed the SPF and four other commonly used measures of adult resilience. They found that the SPF was the only measure that assessed social and cognitive aspects and that it outperformed three other measures and performed comparably with a fourth. The structure of the SPF in comparison to four other measures of adult resilience measures, as well as comparison data, is available as a Data in Brief article. Noticing the absence of research examining the effectiveness of adult resilience measures in child or adult sexual assault, Ponce-Garcia, Madewell and Brown (2016) demonstrated SPF's effectiveness in that domain. An investigation of the effectiveness of the SPF in the Southern Plains Tribes of the Native American and American Indian community was ongoing in 2016.  Properties  The SPF consists of four sub- scales, two social protective factors and two cognitive protective factors.  Social subscales  Social support measures the availability of social resources in the form of family and/or friends. Social skill measures the ability to make and maintain relationships. The two should be positively correlated. Higher scores on the social sub-scales indicate unity with friends and/or family, friend/family group optimism and general friend/family support.  Cognitive subscales  The goal efficacy sub-scale measures confidence in the ability to achieve goals. The planning and prioritizing behavior sub-scale measures the ability to recognize the relative importance of tasks, the tendency to approach tasks in order of importance, and the use of lists for organization.  Scoring  Adding the scores from the four sub-scales results in an overall resilience score. Adding scores from either the two social sub-scales or the two cognitive sub-scales results in a social resilience or cognitive resilience score, respectively. The sub-scale scores can also be viewed as an individual profile of strengths and deficits to indicate priorities for therapeutic plans. This additive approach could theoretically allow varying subscale scores to cancel each other out and incorrectly indicate low overall resilience. However, research shows that social and cognitive characteristics work together to support resilience.Reich, Zautra, & Hall, 2010 This concern is also not supported by the characteristics of the SPF. Rather than assessing the number of friends or the frequency of social interaction, the SPF assesses the level of comfort in interacting socially. Similarly, rather than assessing the number of goals or tasks, the SPF assesses confidence in reaching goals once set. The sub-scales are moderately positively correlated and that they all contribute to overall resilience.

His work explores language and identity in the context of Cairo, and reflects connections with the Arab-Islamic canon and world literature. He has worked in many genres in both Arabic and English, and is known for his essays and poems as well as his novels.  Early life  The only child of a formerly Marxist lawyer, Elsaid Rakha, and an English-to- Arabic translator, Labiba Saad, Rakha was born and grew up in Dokki, on the western bank of the Nile, where he lives with his family today. At the age of 17 he left Egypt for the UK, where he obtained a first class honours BA in English and Philosophy from Hull University in 1998. On his return he joined the staff of Al-Ahram Weekly, the Cairo-based English-language newspaper, where he has worked regularly since 1999. Rakha's biography is sketched out in, among other sources, the introduction to Beirut39: New Writing from the Arab World edited by Samuel Shimon, Starkey's chapter in Studying Modern Arabic Literature (footnote 4), Banipal online and Pro Helvetia's Territory Crossings.  Career = Novels  Rakha is best known for his first novel, The Book of the Sultan's Seal: Strange Incidents from History in the City of Mars. First published in 2011 as Kitab at-Tugra: Gharaib at-Tarikh fi Madinat al-Marrikh (Arabic: ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ∑ÿ∫ÿ±Ÿâ: ÿ∫ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ŸÅŸä ŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ŸäÿÆ), the book is studied for its innovative use of Arabic, its postmodern take on the theme of the caliphate, its reimagining of the city of Cairo and its possible significance in the history of Arabic literature. It won the Banipal Seif Ghobash Prize for Paul Starkey‚Äôs English translation in 2015, and was published in French in 2016. For academic interest in The Book of the Sultan's Seal, see Paul Starkey's chapter in Studying Modern Arabic Literature, Benjamin Koerber's paper in the Journal of Arabic Literature, and Anton Shammas's remark on the English publisher's website. For the Banipal Prize, see the Banipal Trust site. For the French translation, by Philippe Vigreux, see . Since 2011 Rakha has completed two other novels in a proposed trilogy on the January Revolution, The Crocodiles (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÖÿßÿ≥Ÿäÿ≠) and Paulo (Arabic: ÿ®ÿßŸàŸÑŸà). The latter was longlisted for the Arabic Booker in 2017 (the IPAF longlist for 2017) and won the 2017 Sawiris Cultural Award for Best Novel in January 2018.  Other work  Rakha is also known as a photographer and the editor of a bilingual literature and photography site named after his first novel, The Sultan's Seal: Cairo's Coolest Cosmopolitan Hotel. His photography is featured on Mada Masr Berfrois, P1xels and Bidoun. His site has helped to introduce significant young writers in Arabic like the Libyan Ali Latife, the Algerian Salah Badis, the Palestinian Carol Sansour and the Egyptian Mina Nagy; it has featured literary and photographic figures including Bezav Mahmod, Hilary Plum, Niall Griffiths and Pauls Toutonghi. A list of contributors can be found at sultansseal.com. Prior to writing The Book of the Sultan's Seal, Rakha contributed to the coverage of Arab culture in English for many years as a reporter, literary critic and cultural editor. See the Al- Ahram Weekly archives for Rakha's numerous pieces in the Culture and Profile sections especially. He also wrote literary non-fiction and poetry in Arabic, for which he was chosen to participate in the Hay Festival Beirut39 event as one of the 39 best Arab writers under 40.
