Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson in their directorial debuts, it stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow as the voices of the lead characters. The film parodies other fairy tale adaptations, primarily aimed at animated Disney films. In the story, an ogre called Shrek (Myers) finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures who have been banished by the corrupt Lord Farquaad (Lithgow) aspiring to be king. Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to regain control of his swamp in return for rescuing Princess Fiona (Diaz), whom Farquaad intends to marry. With the help of Donkey (Murphy), Shrek embarks on his quest but soon falls in love with the princess, who is hiding a secret that will change his life forever. The rights to Steig's book were purchased by Steven Spielberg in 1991. He originally planned to produce a traditionally-animated film based on the book, but John H. Williams convinced him to bring the film to the newly-founded DreamWorks in 1994. Jeffrey Katzenberg began active development of the film in 1995 immediately following the studio's purchase of the rights from Spielberg. Chris Farley was originally cast as the voice for the title character, recording nearly all of the required dialogue. After Farley died in 1997 before the work was finished, Mike Myers stepped in to voice the character, which was changed to a Scottish accent in the process. The film was intended to be motion-captured, but after poor results, the studio decided to hire Pacific Data Images to complete the final computer animation. Shrek premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or, making it the first animated film since Disney's Peter Pan (1953) to be chosen to do so. It was widely praised as an animated film that featured adult-oriented humor and themes, while catering to children at the same time. The film was theatrically released in the United States on May 18, 2001, and grossed $484.4 million worldwide against a production budget of $60 million. Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. It earned six award nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), ultimately winning Best Adapted Screenplay. The film's success helped establish DreamWorks Animation as a prime competitor to Pixar in feature film computer animation, and three sequels were released—Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010)—along with two holiday specials, a spin-off film, and a stage musical that kickstarted the Shrek franchise. Although plans for a fifth film were canceled prior to the fourth film's release, the project was revived in 2016 and has since stalled, with production and a potential release date getting pushed back. Plot Shrek is an anti-social and highly-territorial green ogre who loves the solitude of his swamp. His life is interrupted after the dwarfish Lord Farquaad of Duloc exiles a countless number of fairytale creatures to Shrek's swamp. Angered by the intrusion, he decides to pay Farquaad a visit and demand they be moved elsewhere. He reluctantly allows the talkative Donkey, who was exiled as well, to tag along and guide him to Duloc. Meanwhile, Farquaad tortures Gingerbread Man for the location of fairytale creatures still in hiding. His guards interrupt and present him with Snow White's Magic Mirror. Upon asking the Mirror if his kingdom is the fairest of them all, Farquaad is told he is not even a king and must marry a princess to become one. He decides to pursue Princess Fiona, who is locked in a castle tower guarded by a dragoness. Unwilling to perform the task himself, he organizes a tournament in which the winner receives the \\"privilege\\" of rescuing Fiona. Shrek and Donkey arrive during the tournament and easily defeat a swarm of Farquaad's knights. Farquaad proclaims them champions and demands that they rescue Fiona. Shrek negotiates to have the fairytale creatures relocated if he succeeds, and Farquaad accepts. Shrek and Donkey travel to the castle and are attacked by Dragon, who corners Donkey. In desperation, he sweet-talks her, and she starts to fall in love with him. Meanwhile, Shrek locates Fiona, who is appalled at his lack of romanticism and the fact he had not slain Dragon. They flee the castle after rescuing Donkey, but when Shrek reveals that he is an ogre, Fiona refuses to go to Duloc unless Farquaad himself arrives, so Shrek simply carries her. That night after setting up camp, Fiona goes off alone and Shrek explains to Donkey his frustration with being judged by his looks. Fiona overhears and decides to be kind to Shrek. The next day, they encounter a condescending Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men, and Fiona dispatches them easily with martial arts when they attack. Shrek is impressed with Fiona, and they begin to fall in love. When the trio nears Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a windmill for the evening. Donkey hears strange noises from within and investigates, discovering that Fiona has transformed into an ogress. She explains she has been cursed since childhood, forced to transform every night after sunset and changing back at sunrise. She tells Donkey only \\"true love's kiss\\" will break the spell and change her to \\"love's true form\\". Meanwhile, Shrek is about to confess his feelings to Fiona, when he overhears the conversation as she is calling herself an \\"ugly beast\\". Believing that Fiona was talking about him, Shrek angrily leaves and returns the next morning with Lord Farquaad. Confused and hurt by Shrek's abrupt hostility toward her, Fiona accepts Farquaad's marriage proposal and requests they be married before nightfall. Shrek abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp. Angered, Donkey arrives at the swamp and confronts a still upset Shrek. During their quarrel, Donkey explains that the \\"ugly beast\\" Fiona was referring to was someone else, and the two reconcile. Donkey urges Shrek to express his feelings for Fiona before she marries, and the two quickly travel to Duloc by riding Dragon, whom Donkey is now in a relationship with. Shrek interrupts the wedding just before the ceremony completes and tells Fiona that Farquaad is only marrying her to become king. The sun sets as Fiona transforms into an ogress in front of everyone, causing a surprised Shrek to understand what he overheard. Outraged, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and Fiona detained. Guided by Donkey, Dragon bursts in and devours Farquaad alive, much to the delight of the people of Duloc. Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss. Fiona assumes \\"love's true form\\" as the curse predicted, and remains an ogress permanently. No longer believing she is beautiful, Fiona is consoled by Shrek, who tells her she always has been. They get married in the swamp surrounded by other fairytale creatures, and leave on their honeymoon.

Williams got hold of the book from his children and when he brought it to DreamWorks, it caught Jeffrey Katzenberg's attention and the studio decided to make it into a film. Recounting the inspiration of making the film, Williams said: After buying the rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put it in active development in November 1995. Steven Spielberg had thought about making a traditionally animated film adaption of the book before, when he bought the rights to the book in 1991 before the founding of DreamWorks, where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey. In the beginning of production, co-director Andrew Adamson refused to be intimidated by Katzenberg and had an argument with him how much should the film appeal to adults. Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he deemed some of Adamson's ideas, such as adding sexual jokes and Guns N' Roses music to the soundtrack, to be too outrageous. Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson. Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know whom to go to with specific detail questions about the film's sequences; \\"We both ended up doing a lot of everything,\\" Adamson said. \\"We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything.\\" Some early sketches of Shrek's house were done between 1996 and 1997 using Photoshop, with the sketches showing Shrek first living in a garbage dump near a human village called Wart Creek. It was also thought one time that he lived with his parents and kept rotting fish in his bedroom. Donkey was modeled after Pericles (born 1994; also known as Perry), a real miniature donkey from Barron Park in Palo Alto, California. Raman Hui, supervising animator of Shrek, stated that Fiona \\"wasn't based on any real person\\" and he did many different sketches for her. He had done over 100 sculptures of Fiona before the directors chose the final design. In early development, the art directors visited Hearst Castle, Stratford upon Avon, and Dordogne for inspiration. Art Director Douglas Rogers visited a magnolia plantation in Charleston, South Carolina for inspiration of Shrek's swamp. Planned characters not used in the film include Goldilocks and Sleeping Beauty. During production, animators who failed while working on other projects, such as The Prince of Egypt, were often sent to work on Shrek. The reassignment was known as being \\"Shreked\\" and being sent to \\"the Gulag\\". Casting Nicolas Cage was initially offered the role of Shrek but he turned it down because he did not want to look like an ogre. In 2013, Cage explained furthermore: \\"When you're drawn, in a way it says more about how children are going to see you than anything else, and I so care about that.\\" Mike Myers was re-cast as Shrek after Chris Farley's death. Chris Farley was initially hired to voice Shrek, and he had recorded nearly all of the dialogue for the character, but died before completing the project. A story reel featuring a sample of Farley's recorded dialogue was leaked to the public in August 2015. DreamWorks then re-cast the voice role to Mike Myers, who insisted on a complete script rewrite, to leave no traces of Farley's version of Shrek. According to Myers, he wanted to voice the character \\"for two reasons: I wanted the opportunity to work with Jeffrey Katzenberg; and [the book is] a great story about accepting yourself for who you are.\\" After Myers had completed providing the voice for the character, when the film was well into production, he asked to re-record all of his lines with a Scottish accent, similar to that his mother used when she told him bedtime stories and also used for his roles in other films, such as So I Married an Axe Murderer and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. According to the DVD commentary, he had also tried using country and Canadian accents.Shrek. DVD Commentary, 2001. After hearing the alternative, Katzenberg agreed to redo scenes in the film, saying, \\"It was so good we took $4m worth of animation out and did it again.\\" A point Myers disputes, saying \\"it didn't cost the studio 'millions of dollars',\\" as rumored. \\"What it meant is instead of me going in for ten sessions, I went in for twenty sessions. I got paid the same.\\" Because of Myers voicing the character, more ideas began to come. There were clearer story points, fresher gags and comedy bits. \\"I got a letter from Spielberg thanking me so much for caring about the character,\\" Myers said. \\"And he said the Scottish accent had improved the movie.\\" Another person planned to voice a character in the film was Janeane Garofalo, who was set to star alongside Farley as Princess Fiona. However, she was fired from the project for unexplained reasons. Years later, Garofalo stated \\"I was never told why [I was fired]. I assume because I sound like a man sometimes? I don't know why. Nobody told me ... But, you know, the movie didn't do anything, so who cares?\\" Animation Shrek was originally set up to be a live-action/CG animation hybrid with background plate miniature sets and the main characters composited into the scene as motion-captured computer graphics, using an ExpertVision Hires Falcon 10 camera system to capture and apply realistic human movement to the characters. A sizable crew was hired to run a test, and after a year and a half of R & D, the test was finally screened in May 1997. The results were not satisfactory, with Katzenberg stating \\"It looked terrible, it didn't work, it wasn't funny, and we didn't like it.\\" The studio then turned to its production partners at Pacific Data Images (PDI), who began production with the studio in 1998 and helped Shrek get to its final, computer-animated look. At this time, Antz was still in production at the studio and effects supervisor Ken Bielenberg was asked by Aron Warner \\"to start development for Shrek\\". Similar to previous PDI films, PDI used its own proprietary software (like its own Fluid Animation System) for its animated movies. For some elements, however, it also took advantage of some of the powerhouse animation software in the market. This is particularly true with Maya, which PDI used for most of its dynamic cloth animation and for the hair of Fiona and Farquaad. \\"We did a lot of work on character and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation,\\" Hui noted. \\"In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us a long time to get right.\\" One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it didn't look like that of a Chia Pet. This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.). It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the Shrek movie including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and much attention from the lighting and visual effects teams. Shrek has 31 sequences, with 1,288 shots in every sequence total. Aron Warner said that the creators \\"envisioned a magical environment that you could immerse yourself into\\". Shrek includes 36 separate in-film locations to make the world of the film, which DreamWorks claimed was more than any previous computer-animated feature before. In-film locations were finalized and as demonstrated by past DreamWorks animated movies, color and mood was of the utmost importance. Music Shrek is the third DreamWorks animated film (and the only film in the Shrek series) to have Harry Gregson-Williams team up with John Powell to compose the score following Antz (1998) and Chicken Run (2000). John Powell was left out to compose scores for later Shrek films with Williams due to a conflict. The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios by Nick Wollage and Slamm Andrews, with the latter mixing it at Media Ventures and Patricia Sullivan-Fourstar handling mastering. Shrek introduced a new element to give the film a unique feel. The film used pop music and other Oldies to make the story more forward. Covers of songs like \\"On the Road Again\\" and \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" were integrated in the film's score. The band Smash Mouth's song \\"All Star\\" gained massive popularity due to its usage in the film's opening credits. As the film was about to be completed, Katzenberg suggested to the filmmakers to redo the film's ending to \\"go out with a big laugh\\"; instead of ending the film with just a storybook closing over Shrek and Fiona as they ride off into the sunset, they decided to add a song \\"I'm a Believer\\" covered by Smash Mouth and show all the fairytale creatures in the film. Although Rufus Wainwright's version of the song \\"Hallelujah\\" appeared in the soundtrack album, it was John Cale's version that appeared in the film; in a radio interview, Rufus Wainwright suggested that his version of \\"Hallelujah\\" did not appear in the film due to the \\"glass ceiling\\" he was hitting because of his sexuality. An alternative explanation is that, although the filmmakers wanted Cale's version for the film, licensing issues prevented its use in the soundtrack album, because Wainwright was an artist for DreamWorks but Cale was not. Cultural references In many places the film references classic movies, predominantly those by Disney. When Tinker Bell falls on Donkey and he says \\"I can fly\\" and people around including the Three Little Pigs say \\"He can fly, he can fly\\"; this is a reference to Disney's Peter Pan. This scene is also a reference to the Disney film Dumbo, where Donkey says, while flying, \\"You might have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly, but I bet you ain't never seen a Donkey fly\\" The scene where Fiona is singing to the blue bird is a reference to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The transformation scene at the end of the film references Disney's Beauty and the Beast. When Shrek crosses the bridge to the Castle and says, \\"That'll do, Donkey, that'll do,\\" this is a reference to the movie Babe. The scene where Princess Fiona is fighting the Merry Men is a lengthy reference to the film The Matrix. At the end of the film, the Gingerbread Man at the end with a crutch (and one leg) says \\"God bless us, everyone\\" which is a reference to Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol. In the scene where the Magic Mirror gives Lord Farquaad the option to marry three princesses, it parodies popular American television show The Dating Game featuring: Cinderella and Snow White. In addition, Lord Farquaad's theme park style kingdom Duloc heavily mimics Disneyland, even in so far as parodying the famous 'It's A Small World' musical ride in the scene with the singing puppets. Release=Marketing In 2000, IMAX released CyberWorld onto its branded large- screen theaters. It was a compilation film that featured stereoscopic conversions of various animated shorts and sequences, including the bar sequence in Antz. DreamWorks was so impressed by the technology used for the sequence's \\"stereoscopic translation\\", that the studio and IMAX decided to plan a big-screen 3D version of Shrek. The film would have been re-released during the Christmas season of 2001, or the following summer, after its conventional 2D release. The re-release would have also included new sequences and an alternate ending. Plans for this was dropped due to \\"creative changes\\" instituted by DreamWorks and resulted in a loss of $1.18 million, down from IMAX's profit of $3.24 million. Radio Disney was told not to allow any ads for the film to air on the station, stating, \\"Due to recent initiatives with The Walt Disney Company, we are being asked not to align ourselves promotionally with this new release Shrek. Stations may accept spot dollars only in individual markets.\\" The restriction was later relaxed to allow ads for the film's soundtrack album onto the network. On May 7, 2001, Burger King began promotions for the film, giving out a selection of nine exclusive Candy Caddies based on the Shrek characters, in Big Kids Meal and Kids Meal orders. Ice cream chain Baskin-Robbins also ran an 8-week promotion of the film, selling products such as Shrek's Hot Sludge Sundae, a combination of Oreo Cookies 'n Cream ice cream, hot fudge, crushed chocolate cookies, whipped cream and squiggly gummy worms, and Shrek Freeze Frame Cake, featuring an image of Shrek and Donkey framed by sunflowers. This was to support the film's DVD/VHS release.Baskin-Robbins in big Shrek's promotion at thefreelibrary.com. Home media The film was released by DreamWorks Home Entertainment on VHS and DVD on November 2, 2001. Both releases included Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party, a 3-minute musical short film, that takes up right after Shreks ending, with film's characters performing a medley of modern pop songs. Shrek was released on video the same day that Pixar's Monsters, Inc. hit theaters. Since videos were traditionally released on Tuesdays, Disney's executives did not receive this well, saying that the move \\"seemed like an underhanded attempt to siphon off some of their film's steam\\". DreamWorks responded that it \\"simply shifted the release to a Friday to make it more of an event and predicted that it and other studios would do so more frequently with important films.\\" Monsters, Inc. earned that weekend more than $62 million, breaking the record for an animated film, while Shreks video release made more than $100 million, and eventually became the biggest selling DVD at the time with over 5.5 million sales. Shrek generated more than $420 million in revenue for DreamWorks on DVD and VHS, and has sold more than 21 million copies of the 23 million shipped by January 2002. Worldwide, more than 10 million Shrek DVDs have been sold by that point. A 3D version of the film was released on Blu-ray 3D by Paramount Home Entertainment on December 1, 2010, along with its sequels, and a regular 2D Blu-ray boxset of the series was released six days later. Reception=Box office Shrek opened on around 6,000 screens across 3,587 theaters; eleven of them showed the film digitally, made possible by the THX Division of Lucasfilm. This was the first time that DreamWorks had shown one of its films digitally. The film earned $11.6 million on its first day and $42.3 million on its opening weekend, topping the box office for the weekend and averaging $11,805 from 3,587 theaters. In its second weekend, due to the Memorial Day Weekend holiday, the film gained 0.3 percent to $42.5 million and $55.2 million over the four-day weekend, resulting in an overall 30 percent gain. Despite this, the film finished in second place behind Pearl Harbor and had an average of $15,240 from expanding to 3,623 sites. In its third weekend, the film retreated 34 percent to $28.2 million for a $7,695 average from expanding to 3,661 theaters. The film closed on December 6, 2001, after grossing $267.7 million domestically, along with $216.7 million overseas, for a worldwide total of $484.4 million. Produced on a $60 million budget, the film was a huge box office smash and is the fourth highest- grossing film of 2001 behind Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and Monsters, Inc.. The film sold an estimated 47,290,600 tickets in North America. Shrek became the highest-grossing animated film ever to be released in Australia, passing the mark set by The Lion King in 1994. In the United Kingdom, Shrek regained the top spot at the British box office after being beaten out the previous week by Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, earning a $20.3 million since its opening in the UK. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 88% approval rating based on 203 reviews, with an average rating of 7.81/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"While simultaneously embracing and subverting fairy tales, the irreverent Shrek also manages to tweak Disney's nose, provide a moral message to children, and offer viewers a funny, fast-paced ride.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 84 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. Eddie Murphy was particularly praised by reviewers for his performance and role as Donkey. Roger Ebert praised the film, giving it four stars out of a possible four and describing it as \\"jolly and wicked, filled with sly in-jokes and yet somehow possessing a heart\\". USA Todays Susan Wloszczyna praised Eddie Murphy's performance, stating it \\"gives the comic performance of his career, aided by sensational digital artistry, as he brays for the slightly neurotic motormouth\\". Richard Schickel of Time also enjoyed Murphy's role, stating \\"No one has ever made a funnier jackass of himself than Murphy.\\" Peter Rainer of New York magazine liked the script, also stating \\"The animation, directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is often on the same wriggly, giggly level as the script, although the more \\"human\\" characters, such as Princess Fiona and Lord Farquaad, are less interesting than the animals and creatures—a common pitfall in animated films of all types.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote \\"Shrek is a world-class charmer that could even seduce the Academy when it hands out the first official animation Oscar next year.\\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \\"Shrek is not a guilty pleasure for sophisticated movie- goers; it is, purely and simply, a pleasure.\\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote \\"The witty, fractured fairy tale Shrek has a solid base of clever writing.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A-, saying \\"A kind of palace coup, a shout of defiance, and a coming of age for DreamWorks.\\" Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel wrote \\"It's a pleasure to be able to report that the movie both captures and expands upon the book's playful spirit of deconstruction.\\" Steven Rosen of The Denver Post wrote \\"DreamWorks Pictures again proves a name to trust for imaginative, funny animated movies that delight kids and adults equally.\\" Susan Stark of The Detroit News gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"Swift, sweet, irreverent, rangy and as spirited in the writing and voice work as it is splendid in design.\\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"A fat green ogre with a grouchy disposition and worse manners, Shrek is the sort of unlikely hero that nobody could love – except just about everyone who sees this hip and hilarious animated delight.\\" Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make Shrek an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication.\\" Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars, calling it \\"a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass\\". Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying \\"Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it's just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of Shrek.\\" William Steig, the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating \\"We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, 'What has Hollywood done to it?' But we loved it. We were afraid it would be too sickeningly cute and, instead, Bill just thought they did a wonderful, witty job of it.\\" John Anderson of Newsday wrote \\"The kind of movie that will entertain everyone of every age and probably for ages to come.\\" Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote \\"In an era when much on film seems old, Shrek seems new and fresh and clever.\\" Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film five out of five stars, saying \\"Despite all its high-tech weirdness, it is really that most perdurable of human constructions, a tale told well and true.\\" Joe Baltake of The Sacramento Bee wrote that it \\"isn't so much a fractured spoof of everything Disney, but actually a Monty Python flick for kids – kids of all ages\\". Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote \\"What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers whose voices remind us of their stellar screen personae in live-action movies.\\" Lisa Alspector of the Chicago Reader wrote \\"This romantic fantasy complicates the roles of beauty and beast, making it hard to guess what form a sensitive resolution will take.\\" Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote \\"The charms of Shrek, which is based on the children's book by William Steig, go far beyond in-jokes for adults.\\" John Zebrowski of The Seattle Times gave the film three out of four stars, saying \\"The movie is helped immensely by its cast, who carry it through some of the early, sluggish scenes. But this is Murphy's movie. Donkey gets most of the good lines, and Murphy hits every one.\\" A mixed review came from Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune, who gave the film two and a half stars out of four and compared the film to Toy Story 2, saying it \\"had a higher in- jokes/laughs ratio without straining to demonstrate its hipness or to evoke heartfelt emotions\\". On the more negative side, Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice said he was \\"desperately avoiding the risk of even a half-second of boredom\\", and said \\"the movie is wall-to-window-to-door noise, babbling, and jokes (the first minute sees the first fart gag), and demographically it's a hard-sell shotgun spray.\\" Christy Lemire of the Associated Press described Shrek as a \\"90-minute onslaught of in-jokes\\", and said while it \\"strives to have a heart\\" with \\"a message about beauty coming from within\\", \\"somehow [the message] rings hollow\\". Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said, despite the film \\"cunning the rendering of surfaces, there's still something flat and charmless in the digital look, and most of the pleasure rises not from the main romance but from the quick, incidental gags.\\" Accolades At the 74th Academy Awards, Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, beating Monsters, Inc. and Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, \\"best-of\\" list, saying, \\"Prince Charming? So last millennium. This decade, fairy-tale fans – and Princess Fiona – fell for a fat and flatulent Ogre. Now, that's progress.\\" It was nominated for The Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. Shrek was also nominated for 6 BAFTA Awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Film. Eddie Murphy became the first actor to ever receive a BAFTA nomination for a voice- over performance. The film was also nominated for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, Best Film Music, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Shrek was nominated for a dozen Annie Awards from ASIFA-Hollywood, and won eight Annies including Best Animated Feature and Outstanding Individual Achievement for Directing in an Animated Feature Production. In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \\"Ten top Ten\\"; the best ten films in ten \\"classic\\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community Shrek was acknowledged as the eighth best film in the animated genre, and the only non-Disney·Pixar film in the Top 10. Shrek was also ranked second in a Channel 4 poll of the \\"100 Greatest Family Films\\", losing out on the top spot to E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. In 2005, Shrek came sixth in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Cartoons poll behind The Simpsons, Tom and Jerry, South Park, Toy Story and Family Guy. In November 2009, the character, Lord Farquaad, was listed No. 14 in IGN UK's \\"Top 15 Fantasy Villains\\". In 2006, it was ranked third on Bravo's 100 funniest films list. The film's title character was awarded his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2010.

Influence Previous films and TV shows, such as Fractured Fairy Tales and The Princess Bride, have parodied the traditional fairy tale. However, Shrek itself has noticeably influenced the current generation of mainstream animated films. Particularly after Shrek 2, animated films began to incorporate more pop culture references and end-film musical numbers. Such elements can be seen in films like Robots, Chicken Little and Doogal. It also inspired a number of computer animated films which also spoofed fairy tales, or other related story genres, often including adult- oriented humor, most of which were not nearly as successful as Shrek, such as Happily N'Ever After, Igor, and Hoodwinked! On November 29, 2018, YouTube channel 3GI, along with over 200 animators and content creators, released Shrek Retold, a scene-for-scene recreation of the original movie. Other media Several video game adaptations of the film have been published on various game console platforms, including Shrek (2001), Shrek: Hassle at the Castle (2002), Shrek: Extra Large (2002), Shrek: Super Party (2002) and Shrek SuperSlam (2005). Shrek was also included as a bonus unlockable character in the video game Tony Hawk's Underground 2 (2004). In 2003, Dark Horse Comics released a three-issue mini-series comic book adaptation of Shrek which was written by Mark Evanier, and the issues were later compiled into a trade paperback. A musical version, based on the film, with music by Jeanine Tesori and a book and lyrics by David Lindsay-Abaire, opened on Broadway on December 14, 2008, and closed January 3, 2010, running for a total of 441 performances. It starred Brian d'Arcy James in the title role, Sutton Foster as Princess Fiona, Christopher Sieber as Lord Farquaad, Daniel Breaker as Donkey, and John Tartaglia as Pinocchio. The Broadway production was recorded and released on DVD, Blu-ray and digital media.Cerasaro, Pat (July 19, 2013) SHREK: THE MUSICAL Now Available For Pre-Order. Broadway World.

A shot-for-shot fan remake titled Shrek Retold was released through 3GI Industries on November 29, 2018. The project was a collaboration of 200 filmmakers and mixes live action, hand drawn animation, Flash animation, CGI and various other art forms to recreate the film. The film is available on YouTube for free. Sequels and spin-offs Three sequels were released over the years – Shrek 2 in 2004, Shrek the Third in 2007, and Shrek Forever After in 2010. Shrek 2 was the only one to receive similar acclaim from critics, though all three sequels were commercially successful. Shrek the Halls (2007) and Scared Shrekless (2010) were released as holiday- themed short films, and a spin-off prequel film entitled Puss in Boots was released in 2011. A fifth feature film was originally planned during the development of Shrek Forever After, but the idea was later abandoned by DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg. Leading up to NBCUniversal's planned acquisition of DreamWorks Animation in 2016, it was announced that a fifth Shrek film would be released in 2019. On November 6, 2018, Variety reported that Chris Meledandri had been tasked to reboot both Shrek and Puss in Boots, with the original cast potentially returning to reprise their roles. While cast members reported that a script was completed for a fifth Shrek film, development stalled and future plans have yet to be officially announced.

Summary More than 30% of non-Asian Buddhists are Jews – and many have become leaders in the spiritual movement. Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, who considered himself a non-theistic Jew, found solace in Eastern religion. A leader in the counterculture movement, Ginsberg explored Buddhist meditation and belief and expressed his spiritual discontent in his poetry. \\"Jerusalems hated walls, I couldn't get over the holy side and weep where I was supposed to by history,\\" he wrote cynically about his trip to Israel in the poem \\"Angkor Wat\\", continuing, \\"Returning home at last, years later as prophesied, is this the way I'm supposed to feel?\\" The film shows an archival television interview of Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben- Gurion and his old friend, the Buddhist former Prime Minister of Burma as they discuss religion. Before they begin, the Prime Minister from Burma blurts out, \\"How is your wife? How is Mrs. Ben-Gurion?\\" His question is full of genuine interest and sets the tone of their debate, what seems to be the understanding that their religious differences are trumped by something more important—their human connection.

Career Born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, Rammell began his football career with nearby Atherstone United. In 1989, following interest from league clubs such as Coventry City, Leicester City and Birmingham City, Rammell was spotted by Manchester United scout Nobby Stiles, who recommended that manager Alex Ferguson sign the 22-year-old Rammell. Ferguson travelled to Atherstone to complete the signing for a fee of £40,000. Atherstone United used the money made from Rammell's sale to Manchester United to build a stand at their home ground, which was later named the Andy Rammell Stand. Rammell was a regular in the Manchester United reserve team, scoring seven goals in 26 appearances, but he never played a first-team game for the club and was sold to Barnsley for £100,000 in September 1990. He found his niche with Barnsley scoring 44 goals in 185 league appearances over a period of six seasons. He joined Southend United in 1996, but the team finished bottom of the league in two consecutive seasons, falling from the First Division to the Third Division. After scoring 13 goals in 69 league appearances, he moved to Second Division Walsall. With 18 goals in his first season with Walsall, Rammell was largely responsible for the team finishing as Second Division runners-up in 1998–99 and securing promotion to the First Division. He also played a part in Walsall's run to the Southern Area Final of the 1998–99 Football League Trophy, scoring in the area semi-final against Cambridge United. However, his performance dropped off in 1999–2000, and he scored just five goals in 30 league appearances as Walsall finished in 22nd place and were relegated back to the Second Division. Although Rammell earned legendary status amongst Walsall fans after scoring the winning goals against local rivals Wolves, West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City A move to Wycombe Wanderers followed in September 2000, with Rammell's 10 goals in 2000–01 keeping the team afloat in mid-table; however, it was his two goals in the FA Cup that proved most valuable as Wycombe went on a run to the semi-finals before losing to Liverpool. He scored another 11 league goals the following season, as well as another two in the FA Cup, but Wycombe were unable to repeat the feats of the previous season, losing to Fulham after a replay in the third round. In 2002–03, Rammell scored just four league goals for Wycombe, all of them coming before the turn of the year, and in March 2003, he was allowed to move to Third Division Bristol Rovers. With four goals in three matches at the end of the season, he helped the club narrowly avoid relegation out of The Football League. The following season would prove to be Rammell's last as a footballer; his participation in matches was limited apart from a brief flurry of action in October and November 2003, and in December 2003, he suffered from an injury to his right knee in a game against Yeovil Town. The injury forced his retirement from the professional game, and though he attempted a comeback with non-league Forest Green Rovers, he suffered a recurrence of the injury and retired completely in July 2004 at the age of 37.

She was active in the Peace Society, the Temperance movement and founded the Darlington Ladies Anti-Slavery Society. In 1853 she married Dr. John Pringle Nichol (1804–1859), Regius Professor of Astronomy at the University of Glasgow. She was one of about six women who were in the painting of the World Anti-Slavery Convention of 1840. Biography=Early life Elizabeth Pease was born in Darlington, England to Joseph Pease and his wife Elizabeth Beaumont, who were members of the Society of Friends (Quakers). Her father was a founder of the Peace Society. The Quakers held strong views about the value of educating girls as well as boys. Elizabeth attended a school with her brother and male cousins, one of only two girls at the school. When it closed down, her education continued at home, where it was disrupted by her mother's poor health: Elizabeth nursed her mother from an early age. Public life By 1837, Pease was leading the Darlington Ladies Anti-Slavery Society. Charles Stuart, an Anti-Slavery abolitionist and lecturer, encouraged her to send a female delegate or attend a national society being formed by Joseph Sturge. Pease resisted more public involvement, as she did not seek the limelight but wanted to work locally for the causes she held to be important. In 1838 Pease published an important pamphlet with Jane Smeal titled Address to the Women of Great Britain. This document was a call to action to British women, asking them to speak in public and to form their own anti-slavery organisations. 1840 Convention In 1840, Pease travelled to London to attend the World Anti-Slavery Convention beginning on 12 June, as did her friend, Eliza Wigham who was secretary of the Edinburgh Ladies Anti-Slavery Society. Before it started, she met American activists Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.Elizabeth Crawford, The Women's Suffrage Movement, p. 462, accessed 4 August 2008 Before the convention opened, Sturge, the British organiser, told the six women delegates they would not be allowed to participate. Leading English Anti-Slavery members had rebuked him for thinking this \\"insane innovation, this woman-intruding delusion,\\" should be allowed. At the time, women attendees were required to sit in segregated areas out of sight of the male delegates. The matter became contentious because some of the male delegates from the United States supporting the women's participation. They included George Bradburn, Wendell Phillips, James Mott, William Adam, Isaac Winslow, J. P. Miller and Henry B. Stanton. William Lloyd Garrison, who did not arrive until 17 June,Frances H. Bradburn, A Memorial of George Bradburn, 1883 refused to take his seat until women had equality in seating.Harriet H. Robinson, Massachusetts in the woman suffrage movement. A general, political, legal and legislative history from 1774, to 1881, accessed 19 July 2006 Henry Grew, an American Baptist spoke in favour of the men's right to exclude women, despite his daughter's being one of those affected. The result was that the American women had to join British women observers, such as Lady Byron, Anne Knight and Pease, in a segregated area. The picture above shows Pease in a painting commemorating the international event. It attracted delegates from the United States, France, Haiti, Australia, Ireland, Jamaica and Barbados, as well as Great Britain. With the exception of Mary Clarkson, the women are portrayed to the far right, with none in the foreground. Pease attended with Anne Knight and several other friends, but it was only Knight and Pease of their circle who were among the women notables chosen for the painting. Other women included were Amelia Opie, Baroness Byron, Mary Anne Rawson, Mrs John Beaumont, Elizabeth Tredgold, Mary Clarkson and, at the back, Lucretia Mott. Women's suffrage movement After moving to Edinburgh, Elizabeth became the treasurer for the Edinburgh chapter of the National Society for Women's Suffrage.

It is known for a degree of racial diversity that is unusually high as compared with other churches in the United States. It operates under the mission statement: > \\"Wilcrest Baptist Church is God's multi-ethnic bridge that draws all people > to Jesus Christ, who transforms them from unbelievers to missionaries.\\" Wilcrest was founded in 1970 in what was then the primarily Caucasian suburb of Alief, Texas, later annexed as part of Houston. The congregation matched the racial make-up of the community. However, during the 1980s the neighborhood had changed due to a phenomenon sometimes called white flight and had become primarily African-American. In 1989, the New York Times profiled a wedding conducted in Mandarin, between two graduate students from China whose parents could not attend because of travel restrictions in the wake of the Tiananmen Square Massacre By the early 21st Century the neighborhood around Wilcrest had not only multi-generational blacks, whites, and Latinos, but also new immigrants from Mexico, Nigeria, Cuba, Haiti, and Vietnam. Former pastor Rodney Woo took over the church in 1992, by which time church membership was only 180 members and attendance was down to 200 per service. Himself interracial (his mother is white; his father part Chinese-American), Woo attended an all-black high school in Port Arthur, Texas. Although there were some calls from members to keep the church segregated, Woo quickly convinced the church to reach out to Christians from many backgrounds, and eventually built attendance up to about 500, including members from 47 nations. Dr. Woo left the church in 2010 to become pastor of International Baptist Church in Singapore. In 2009, Dr. Rodney Woo wrote, The Color of Church: A Biblical and Practical Paradigm for Multiracial Churches, a book that documents the story of Wilcrest Baptist Church and how other churches can learn to develop more multi-ethnic church congregations.David Tate, SONlight Foundation http://www.sonspots.org/interviews/the-color-of-church.html In June 2011 Jonathan Williams became the senior pastor of Wilcrest Baptist Church.

He was involved in Scouting for most of his life. Biography Born in Uccle, Michel Tacq spent his childhood in Farciennes and Brussels. He went to study at the Saint-Marie Institute in Schaerbeek and stayed in France for the first years of World War II. He then returned to Belgium to continue his art studies in Charleroi. Ever since his early childhood, Tacq was involved in Scouting, a movement that has been of influence his entire career. At 17, he took on the pseudonym Mitak and developed the comic strip Tam Tam, which appeared in magazines related with Scouting in 1944 and 1945. Tam Tam also appeared in book collections, published by José Henin and De Beiaard. He illustrated for Plein Jeu, Carrefour and L'Hebdomadaire des grands recits. In 1951, Michel Tacq was hired by the World Press, a company which provided Spirou magazine with comics strips. There, he trained and drew under the name \\"Balou\\" some 20 stories for the Oncle Paul series with writing by Octave Joly. He also illustrated \\"Seul maitre à bord\\", the 3rd novel of the collection \\"Marabout-Junior\\", written by Jean-Jacques Schellens, a friend Scout. However, MiTacq hoped for being able to draw a series dedicated to Boy Scouts. Jean Jacques Schellens wrote a scenario whose characters are Sanglier, Marabout, Gustave and Chat. Georges Troisfontaines, founder of the World Press, accepted to publish the project, at a time when the Signe de Piste collection was very popular, but he preferred to trust the scenario to Jean-Michel Charlier and demanded the characters to be reshaped. The first album of La Patrouille des Castors (The Beaver Patrol), Le mystere de Grosbois, was published in 1954 in Spirou magazine. In the face of the immediate success of the series, Dupuis decided to publish albums from 1955. With this series, his career really took off. A second album was published, Les disparus de Ker Aven. Scout leader at Saint Alène, Mitacq decided after the third album to be more committed in the scenario of the series, to insist on the Scouting themes. In 1956 is published Sur la piste de Mowgli, strongly influenced by Kipling's novels. In 1957, he made a report for Spirou magazine at the 9th World Scout Jamboree at Sutton- Coldfield in England with Yvan Delporte. For the creation of Pilote in 1959, Charlier proposed to Mitacq to illustrate the adventures of Jacques Legall. En 1965, with the separation in France of the Scouts into two branches, Rangers and Pionniers, MiTacq and Charlier decided to turn the Castors into Pionniers to develop more opportunities of adventures. L'autobus hanté, the first adventures of the patrol with their new uniform, relating the crossing of Europe in an autobus, was very successful and imitated by several Scouts at that time. In the 1960s, Charlier was so busy that Mitacq created the adventures of Stany Derval. In 1979, Charlier et MiTacq decided amically to stop their longtime collaboration in the course of the making of the album Prisonniers du large. Between 1954 and 1980 22 albums were made by Mitacq and Charlier. This separation did not prevent MiTacq from going on alone or in collaboration with Marc Wasterlain or Jacques Stoquart. On the contrary, this new situation provided him with more autonomy and allowed him to deal with other matters he insisted on. He died on 22 May 1994, leaving unfinished the 31st tome of the Castors series. The integrale of Mitacq's works were published by Dupuis after his death.  Influences and style  Michel Tacq, as an active Scout, was very influenced by the movement's culture. Toucan Bénévole was his totem as Scout in the Troop Saint Aléne at Saint Gilles Bruxelles, then he became Assistant Cub Scout Master from 1951 till 1954, then Pionnier for 5 years. He visited the 1957 World Jamboree. In the first albums of the Beaver Patrol series, the protagonists wear the same yellow and bleu scarf as the Saint Alène troop. He provided for a long time illustrations to the Scouting magazine Plein Jeu from 1950 and for Piste' a magazine consisting of 300 pages of \\"first and second class badges\\" for the Belgian Catholic Scout Federation. He has also drawn illustrations in the magazines Carnet du Louveteau, En route ! and Carrefour, and at the end of his career in Trefle d'Aventure, the magazine of the Belgian catholic guides. He was highly influenced and fascinated by Pierre Joubert and Jijé, notably by the comics album of Jijé dedicated to Baden-Powell's life, which incited him to create a series relating the adventures of a Scout patrol. The graphic style is highly influenced by that of Pierre Joubert. In 1950, he was advised to meet him to improve his style and lived with him for three months. The youngest Beaver Scout, Mouche, was modelled on Pierre Joubert's son. Fan of the collection Signe de Piste, MiTacq insisted to illustrate one of the novels of the series. In the course of 1975, he devoted two months to draw the cover and ten illustrations for Jean Destieu's Les Emeraudes de Colombie. MiTacq also paid tribute to Serge Dalens, the author of the Prince Eric series, by an illustration in 1987, the year when the 50th anniversary of the collection Signe de Piste was celebrated. It is also said that the scenario of the album La couronne cachée (1965), the 13th album of the Beaver Patrol series, was partly inspired by Serge Dalens' Le prince Éric. Publications *La Patrouille des Castors (30 stories published between 1957 and 1993 by Dupuis): the Beaver Patrol was formed of five Boy Scouts with guest members. The comic strip was published in the magazine Spirou. The long collaboration with Jean- Michel Charlier took off in 1954. Mitacq died in 1994 and the Beaver Patrol cartoon series ended. A few months after his death, Spirou magazine justly honoured one of its greatest contributors by giving him a grand homage. The Belgian Scouts also published his illustrations on their 1995 calendar. His books remain popular today among fans and are translated into several languages. With the publication of the first episode of 'La Patrouille des Castors', in the magazine Spirou. 'La Patrouille des Castors', an adventure series about a group of scouts, became Tacq's trademark series. Starting in 1960, MiTacq sporadically illustrated 'La Patrouille des Zoms', a parody on the Castors, written by Yvan Delporte. *Jacques Le Gall (4 stories published in albums between 1980 and 1985 by Dupuis) was illustrated by MiTacq and Follet. In 1959, at the creation of the magazine Pilote, Charlier proposed him to illustrate this new series. The series only ran for six long episodes, and was cancelled due to editorial reasons.Jacques Le Gall faced several contemporary enigmas, including the Templiers' and nazis'tresory and Mediterranean smuggling. The series was later published in Spirou and in albums by Dupuis. *Stany Derval (3 stories published in albums between 1981 and 1987 by Dupuis) was drawn and written by MiTacq alone. When Charlier got too involved with his other comics, MiTacq launched a series of his own to overlap the interludes between Castor stories. From 1968 until 1979, he drew the adventures of Stany Derval, an adventurous motorcyclist, cooperating with several writers, such as André-Paul Duchateau, Maurice Tillieux, Jacques Stoquart, or André Beckers. He was sometimes assisted on the artwork by René Follet. After his separation with Charlier, he gave up the series but make Stany Derval appear in some Castors albums. *Tout Mitacq: the integrale collection Tout MiTacq, published between 1989 and 1997 by Dupuis, consists of 14 volumes grouping La patrouille des Castors, Jacques Le Gall, Stany Derval, plus relevant commentaries about each albums and many illustrations for magazines.

Waswo has collaborated with Rajesh Soni, a local craftsman who hand-paints Waswo's digital prints. Some of these portraits have been published as the book Men of Rajasthan by Serindia Contemporary in Chicago.Men of Rajasthan, Serindia Contemporary, Chicago, 2011 Waswo also has collaborated with the miniaturist painter Rakesh Vijay to create an autobiographical picture-story of his life in India and the accompanying emotions of both alienation and the sense of western privilege. Waswo’s collaborations with Rajsh Soni and R. Vijay are collectively titled \\"A Studio in Rajasthan\\" and have been written about by London-based art critic Edward Lucie-Smith.Edward Lucie-Smith and Dr. Alka Pande (catalogue essays), A Studio in Rajasthan, Palette Art Gallery, New Delhi, 2008 April Harvest From 2007 Waswo has concentrated almost exclusively on the Studio in Rajasthan series of hand-coloured portraits. This has resulted in several exhibitions in India and abroad, most notably \\"Tinted by Tradition\\", a retrospective of this work held at the Bhagwat Prakash Photo Gallery at Udaipur's City Palace Museum. Tinted by Tradition also traced the continuum of hand-painted photographs in the Mewar court, including examples of hand-painted photographs by Rajesh Soni's grandfather Prabhu Lal Verma (Soni). Waswo has continued collaborating in the making of symbolic and autobiographical miniatures with the painter R. Vijay. Waswo sees these miniatures as distinct but parallel body of work.Annapurna Garimella, The Artful Life of R. Vijay, Serindia Contemporary, 2015 The three collaborators, Waswo, Soni, and Vijay, mounted an exhibition titled \\"Confessions of an Evil Orientalist\\" in December 2011 at Gallery Espace in New Delhi. Incorporating more experimental media such as installation, a video, and even a comic book, the exhibition extended their normal repertoire of hand-coloured photographs and miniatures. Confessions of an Evil Orientalist revolved around a list of 101 confessions, written by Waswo in both a sincere and tongue-in-cheek manner, which alluded once again to issues of hegemony, Orientalism, and cultural acceptance. These confessions found expression within three text- based works of art in the exhibition, each viewing the words of the constructed \\"Evil Orientalist\\" from a different perspective. It has been suggested that these works moved from a post-colonial discourse to a post- post-colonial discourse.Kavita Singh, \\"A Song of Love and Longing\\", catalogue essay, Confessions of an Evil Orientalist, Gallery Espace, New Delhi, 2011Amjad Majid, \\"The Role of Roles in Waswo X.

Waswo's work has encouraged debate on the ethical questions of photography, especially the question of a westerner's role in photographing a foreign land. Bangalore-based artist Pushpamala N. in an article titled \\"Photographing the Natives\\" criticizes that Waswo follows the long tradition of hegemonic and largely negative western depictions of the East. She quotes, \\"The \\"truths\\" that Waswo seeks to reveal are not so personal or hidden. In fact they belong to a long history of representing the subcontinent that go back a hundred and fifty years. If one history of seeing India was to see it as an underdeveloped, decadent and inferior subject civilization, another was to posit the inherent \\"spiritualism\\" of the East against the crass materialism of the West. In constructing his archetypal \\"Other\\", Waswo is unable to escape from an inherited way of seeing the Indian landscape and its people\\".Photographing the Natives, Page 167 - 169, India Poems, A Rooftop Vistas Publication Indian writer and cultural theorist Ranjit Hoskote defends Waswo against Pushpamala's criticism. He claims that artists like Waswo, when they step into the Indian situation - choosing to live and work in India and taking Indian subjects as the focus of their work - are either idolised or stigmatised: there is no middle ground of response for them to occupy. He further argues that, \\"Ideologically, Waswo's art is often obliged to justify itself to those who view it as no more than a contemporary projection of classical Orientalism; formally, it is not infrequently forced to explain its affinities with the lineage of pictorialism. To viewers habituated to the fast-forward of artistic strategies that deploy the newest media, also, Waswo may have to defend his retrieval of a 19th-century approach in the 21st century, while declining to be giddily playful or coolly subversive in the postmodernist fashion approved by the practitioners of retro chic. But Waswo's photographic images ought to be viewed in a spirit that can transcend such entrenched, guilt-based binaries of affront and critique, offence and defensiveness. These images are subtle, classical, mannered in the best sense. At the same time, they are unquestionably the testimony of a gaze that is empathetic, for Waswo's observations are made from the viewpoint of a transitive, relational self that releases itself to its subjects, rather than suffocating them in a colonialist authorial embrace.The Paths of Travelling Desire: Waswo X. Waswo's India Poems, Pages 6-10, India Poems, A Rooftop Vistas Publication\\" Art Collector In India Waswo is also known as a collector of fine art prints. He regularly blogs his \\"Collection of Indian Printmaking\\", which contains historical and contemporary examples of Indian etchings, lithographs, woodcuts and screen prints. In the fall of 2011 Waswo was Guest Editor of a trilogy on Indian printmaking put out by the Calcutta- based art magazine Art Etc. news&views.;Vikram Bacchawat, Art Etc. news&views;, August, 2011 Waswo is one of the contributing photographers in Ekalokam Trust for Photography'sProject 365 Tiruvannamalai, a public photo-art project that collectively creates and preserves photographic visuals of the fast vanishing landscape, customs, culture of Dravidian society in South India.

He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers, Pittsburgh Pirates, Los Angeles Angels, and Philadelphia Phillies. Career=New York Mets Guerra signed with the New York Mets as a non-drafted free agent on July 2, 2005. He was named South Atlantic League Pitcher of the Week on July 30, 2006. On July 8, 2007, Guerra represented the New York Mets' organization for the World Team in Major League Baseball's All-Star Futures Game. Minnesota Twins Along with outfielder Carlos Gómez and pitchers Philip Humber and Kevin Mulvey, Guerra was traded to the Minnesota Twins for Johan Santana on January 29, 2008. Carlos Gutierrez & Deolis Guerra smile for a picture with an autograph seeking fan With the Fort Myers Miracle, he compiled a 7–2 record with a 4.83 earned run average in the first half of the 2008 season—helping his team capture the Florida State League (FSL) first-half West Division title. Guerra's first start in the second half of the 2008 season (Tuesday, July 1) was a 4–0 complete game shutout of the Tampa Yankees. He allowed only three hits, and retired 19 in a row between a first inning single by James Cooper and a one-out single by Andres Perez in the seventh. It marked the first shutout of Guerra’ professional career. For the second half, he went 4–7 with a 6.08 ERA in 13 starts. The Miracle again captured the first half division title in 2009, this time in the FSL's newly realigned Southern Division, and Guerra brought a no hitter into the eighth inning of a July 3 game against the Charlotte Stone Crabs. With one out, Christian López broke it up with a double down the left field line. Guerra was promoted to the New Britain Rock Cats immediately after this game (July 7). He was named FSL pitcher of the week for the week of June 29 through July 5. His combined record for Fort Myers and New Britain was 12–11 with a 4.89 ERA and 106 strikeouts. On November 20, 2009, he was added to the Twins' 40-man roster. He began the 2010 season with New Britain, going 1–1 with a 3.07 ERA in five starts prior to being promoted to triple-A. During the 2012 season, the Twins converted Guerra into a relief pitcher. The Twins removed Guerra from their 40-man roster after the 2012 season. Guerra competed for the Venezuelan national baseball team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. He was hospitalized with a blood clot in his right shoulder in March 2013. Pittsburgh Pirates Guerra signed a minor league deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates in November 2014. On June 27, 2015, The Pirates promoted him to the major leagues. He was designated for assignment on July 31. The Cleveland Indians claimed Guerra off of waivers, but the claim was rescinded due to Guerra experiencing knee inflammation, and was placed on the Pirates' disabled list. The Pirates designated Guerra for assignment after the 2015 season, but signed him to a minor league contract with an invitation to 2016 spring training. Los Angeles Angels On December 10, 2015, Guerra was claimed in the Rule 5 draft by the Los Angeles Angels. On May 30, 2016, Guerra was designated for assignment, and outrighted to Triple-A on June 3. The next day, the Angels re- selected Guerra's contract, adding him to the 25-man roster. On February 10, 2017, Guerra was designated for assignment.

The club also features women, youth and veteran teams and a B team that plays in Campeonato Nacional de Rugby II Divisão, Portuguese third division. The club organises the international rugby sevens tournament Arcos Sevens.  History  The club was founded on 1981-07-09 by a group of former students of University of Porto and University of Coimbra, where they had also played. Shortly after, in 1983, the club became champion of the Portuguese Third Division. Also in that year, the club started to have youth teams. On 1986-05-01 the Coutada sports field was inaugurated, created exclusively for practising rugby. In the season of 1986–87, CRAV promoted to Portugal top rugby union level league, Campeonato Nacional de Rugby, and have stayed on that level most of the seasons since then. In 2005, CRAV eventually played, and lost, the championship finals to Dramático de Cascais. In 2006, the municipal stadium of Arcos de Valdevez was inaugurated. In 2007, the juvenile team became national champion of Rugby of 8; also the women's team reached the top national level. In 2012, CRAV returned to the Portuguese top division, after the Portuguese Rugby Federation increased the number of teams in the Campeonato Nacional Honra/Super Bock to 10.

A film is prepared using hydrophilic polymers that rapidly dissolves on the tongue or buccal cavity, delivering the drug to the systemic circulation via dissolution when contact with liquid is made. Zuplenz 8 mg (approved by FDA, July 7, 2010). Photo courtesy of MonoSol Rx. Prolific inventors in thin film drug delivery include Richard Fuisz, Joseph Fuisz, Garry Myers and Robert Yang. This group has contributed over thirty patents in this field. Thin-film drug delivery has emerged as an advanced alternative to the traditional tablets, capsules and liquids often associated with prescription and OTC medications. Similar in size, shape and thickness to a postage stamp, thin-film strips are typically designed for oral administration, with the user placing the strip on or under the tongue (sublingual) or along the inside of the cheek (buccal). These drug delivery options allow the medication to bypass the first pass metabolism thereby making the medication more bioavailable. As the strip dissolves, the drug can enter the blood stream enterically, buccally or sublingually. Evaluating the systemic transmucosal drug delivery, the buccal mucosa is the preferred region as compared to the sublingual mucosa. Different buccal delivery products have been marketed or are proposed for certain diseases like trigeminal neuralgia, Meniere's disease, diabetes, and addiction. There are many commercial non-drug product to use thin films like Mr. Mint and Listerine PocketPaks breath freshening strips. Since then, thin-film products for other breath fresheners, as well as a number of cold, flu, anti-snoring and gastrointestinal medications, have entered the marketplace. There are currently several projects in development that will deliver prescription drugs using the thin- film dosage form.\\"Oral Thin Films,\\" in Orally Disintegrating Tablet and Film Technologies, 5th ed. (Technology Catalysts International, Falls Church, VA, 2008) Formulation of oral drug strips involves the application of both aesthetic and performance characteristics such as strip-forming polymers, plasticizers, active pharmaceutical ingredient, sweetening agents, saliva stimulating agent, flavoring agents, coloring agents, stabilizing and thickening agents. From the regulatory perspectives, all excipients used in the formulation of oral drug strips should be approved for use in oral pharmaceutical dosage forms. Oral drug strip development=Strip forming polymers The polymer employed should be non-toxic, non-irritant and devoid of leachable impurities. It should have good wetting and spreadability property. The polymer should exhibit sufficient peel, shear and tensile strengths. The polymer should be readily available and should not be very expensive. Film obtained should be tough enough so that there won't be any damage while handling or during transportation. Combination of microcrystalline cellulose and maltodextrin has been used to formulate Oral Strips of piroxicam made by hot melt extrusion technique. Pullulan has been the most widely used film former (used in Listerine PocketPak, Benadryl, etc.) Plasticizers Plasticizer is a vital ingredient of the OS formulation. It helps to improve the flexibility of the strip and reduces the brittleness of the strip. Plasticizer significantly improves the strip properties by reducing the glass transition temperature of the polymer. Glycerol, Propylene glycol, low molecular weight polyethylene glycols, phthalate derivatives like dimethyl, diethyl and dibutyl phthalate, Citrate derivatives such as tributyl, triethyl, acetyl citrate, triacetin and castor oil are some of the commonly used plasticizer excipients. Active pharmaceutical ingredient Since the size of the dosage form has limitation, high-dose molecules are difficult to be incorporated in OS. Generally 5%w/w to 30%w/w of active pharmaceutical ingredients can be incorporated in the oral strip. Sweeting, flavoring and coloring agent An important aspect of thin film drug technology is its taste and color. The sweet taste in formulation is more important in case of pediatric population. Natural sweeteners as well as artificial sweeteners are used to improve the flavor of the mouth dissolving formulations for the flavors changes from individual to individual. Pigments such as titanium dioxide is incorporated for coloring. Stabilizing and thickening agents The stabilizing and thickening agents are employed to improve the viscosity and consistency of dispersion or solution of the strip preparation solution or suspension before casting. Drug content uniformity is a requirement for all dosage forms, particularly those containing low dose highly potent drugs. To uniquely meet this requirement, thin film formulations contain uniform dispersions of drug throughout the whole manufacturing process. Since this criterion is essential for the quality of the thin film and final pharmaceutical dosage form, the use of Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM) was recommended to follow the manufacturing process. Oral strips in development An increasing number of film-based therapeutics are in development, including: * Montelukast indicated for the treatment of dementia, asthma and allergy, is being developed variously for uses as a film by IntelGenx and Monosol Rx. * Midatech, a company specializing in nanotechnology, is partnering with Monosol Rx to create a film-based insulin. (Sachs Associates. 5th Annual European Life Science CEP Forum for Partnering and Investing. March 6–7, 2012. Zurich, Switzerland.) * Rizatriptan indicated for the treatment of migraine, is being developed for use as a film by IntelGenx, Monsoon Rx, and Zim Laboratories Ltd. * Monosol Rx is also developing a testosterone film-based therapeutic for the treatment of male hypogonadism. The product is currently in phase 1. * Undergraduate biomedical engineering students at Johns Hopkins University have created a new drug delivery system based on the thin-film technology used by a breath freshener. Laced with a vaccine against rotavirus, the strips could be used to provide the vaccine to infants in impoverished areas. Other molecules like Sildenafil citrate, Tadalafil, Methylcobalamin and Vitamin D3 are also developed by IntelGenx Zim Laboratories Ltd.

The area has one tow lift and vertical differential of 90 m (295 ft). The longest run is 210 m (689 ft). In addition to downhill skiing, the hill also has areas for tobogganing and snowboarding. Little Mac Ski Hill is funded by the District of Mackenzie and is maintained through the municipality of Mackenzie. All matters regarding Little Mac Ski Hill is handled by public works in Mackenzie. Little Mac is one of the main tourist attractions to Mackenzie, British Columbia, even though the hill itself is very small, the close proximity to the town of Mackenzie makes it a hit for families and children of all ages. It was announced on July 25, 2008, that the ski area would receive $160,000 from the Towns for Tomorrow program of the provincial government to rebuild the Little Mac Ski Chalet. Though not directly part of the ski area, there are 32 km (20 mi) of groomed and lit cross-country ski trails immediately accessible from the town of Mackenzie, with three specially built warming huts. 2018 Closure In 2018, it was announced that Little Mac Ski Hill would not operate for the 2018/19 ski season. A community engagement program was established, and the intent of re-opening the ski hill was announced late 2018. As of 2019, the community's response was overwhelmingly in favour of the re-opening of the ski hill, citing that it was an important asset to the community. Plans are currently being explored as of 2020.

Personnel regularly deploy outside the United Kingdom on operations and training. History Parachute training, 1942 The 1st Battalion can trace its origins to 1940, when No. 2 Commando trained as parachutists. In 1941, the battalion was assigned to the 1st Parachute Brigade which also included the 2nd and 3rd battalions. The 1st Parachute Brigade was part of the 1st Airborne Division and remained with it throughout the war. The battalion took part in operations in Tunisia in late 1942 to May 1943, suffering heavy casualties. The battalion and the brigade took part in Operation Fustian, when the Allies invaded Sicily and, again, suffered heavy casualties and was withdrawn to England in late 1943 to train and prepare for the Allied invasion of France. The battalion wasn't used in the initial invasion on 6 June 1944, D-Day, but was held back in the UK in reserve in case any of the five invasion beaches encountered serious difficulties and needed support. The plan turned out not to be required. During the fighting in Normandy numerous plans to drop the 1st Airborne were formed, none of which came to fruition. Finally, in September 1944, the battalion dropped into Arnhem the Netherlands with the rest of the 1st Airborne Division, as part of Operation Market Garden, where they suffered extremely heavy casualties and never saw combat again for the rest of the war. After the war the battalion was reconstituted in 1946, and affiliated to the Brigade of Guards and served with the 6th Airborne Division in Palestine. It was disbanded in 1948, only to be reformed by the renumbering of the 4th/6th Battalion. The battalion was part of Operation Musketeer in 1956. In the 1970s, the battalion first deployed to Northern Ireland in Operation Banner. The battalion was involved in the Ballymurphy Massacre in August 1971, when 11 Catholic civilians were shot dead and many wounded over a two-day period. In January 1972, both the press and some in the Army accused the battalion of brutality against protesters outside Magilligan internment camp.Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume I, Chapter 9, paragraphs 202–221'Bloody Sunday', 30 January 1972 – A Chronology of Events. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN). A week later, on 30 January 1972, the battalion carried out the Bloody Sunday killings, when they opened fire on unarmed protesters in Derry, leaving 14 Catholic civilians dead and 13 wounded; the greatest killing of British subjects by government forces in one incident since the Irish War of Independence. The second official inquiry of the killings found 1st Para's actions \\"unjustified and unjustifiable\\". To date, none of the members of 1 Para have been prosecuted. The battalion was involved in another controversial shooting incident on 7 September 1972, when soldiers shot dead two Protestant civilians and wounded others in the Shankill area of Belfast. A unit of the Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) refused to carry out duties until the battalion was withdrawn from the Shankill.Wood, Ian S. Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press, 2006. pp.104-105 The battalion was involved in the NATO operation in Kosovo in 1999, Operation Agricola. In 2003, they were deployed to the Persian Gulf for Operation Telic in Iraq where despite overwhelming odds, two multiples of No. 8 platoon managed to fight their way out of the town of Majar al-Kabir. The battle took place in June 2003, in the post-invasion period of the Iraq War. During the battle, six Royal Military Policeman of 156 Provost Company were killed by an angry mob.

The battalion took part in its first active operation over the night of 27–28 February 1942, Operation Biting, the raid on Bruneval in France.see On 1 August of the same year, the battalion was renamed the 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment. The battalion was part of the 1st Parachute Brigade, 1st Airborne Division, and fought in the British airborne operations in North Africa, Operation Fustian in Sicily, Operation Slapstick on the Italian mainland and, most famously, the Battle of Arnhem in September 1944. After the Second World War, the battalion was reformed and served with the 6th Airborne Division in Palestine. It was then amalgamated with the 3rd Parachute Battalion and renamed the 2nd/3rd Battalion and shortly afterwards disbanded. A new 2nd Battalion was formed later the same year by renumbering the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion. In 1951, the battalion was deployed to Ismaïlia, Egypt, after civil unrest in the region, to protect the Suez Canal. In July 1956, 2 Para went to Cyprus to counter the EOKA insurgency. It then took part in Operation Musketeer in November of the same year as part of 16 Independent Parachute Brigade, landing by sea and occupying El Cap. In June 1961, as part of an 8,000 strong battle-group, 2 Para was sent to Kuwait to forestall a threatened invasion by Iraq. In early 1965 the battalion was rushed to Singapore in response to a threat of invasion of Borneo by Indonesia. In the following Indonesian Confrontation, B Company repulsed an attack by an Indonesian battalion in the Battle of Plaman Mapu. In March 1969, 2 Para went to the Caribbean island of Anguilla to restore the British administration.

Roled as an Airborne light infantry unit, the battalion is capable of a wide range of operational taskings. Based at Merville Barracks, Colchester Garrison, their barracks in England, personnel regularly deploy outside of the United Kingdom on operations and training. A unique part of the 3rd Battalion is the inclusion of the Guards Parachute Platoon, which is incorporated into B Company and also known as 6 (Guards) Platoon. The Guards Parachute Platoon is made up of volunteers who have passed P Company from the five Regiments of Foot Guards and Infantry qualified members of the Household Cavalry; they can be distinguished from other paratroopers by a \\"blue red blue\\" patch sewn to their beret beneath the Parachute Regiment cap badge. History Three of the first British paratroopers June 1941. Background Impressed by the success of German airborne operations during the Battle of France, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops.Otway, p.21 On 22 June 1940, No. 2 Commando was redeployed to parachute duties and on 21 November re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with both a parachute and glider wing,Shortt & McBride, p.4Moreman, p.91 the men of which took part in the first British airborne operation, Operation Colossus, on 10 February 1941.Guard, p.218 The success of the raid prompted the War Office to expand the airborne forces, setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire in April 1942, and creating the Parachute Regiment as well as converting a number of infantry battalions into airborne battalions or platoons in August 1942.Harclerode, p.218 All parachute forces had to undergo a twelve-day parachute training course at No. 1 Parachute Training School, RAF Ringway. Initial parachute jumps were from a converted barrage balloon and finished with five jumps from an aircraft. Anyone failing to complete a descent was returned to his old unit. Those men who successfully completed the parachute course were presented with their maroon beret and parachute wings.Guard, p.224Guard, p.226 Airborne soldiers were expected to fight against superior numbers of the enemy armed with heavy weapons, including artillery and tanks. Training was as a result designed to encourage a spirit of self-discipline, self-reliance and aggressiveness. Emphasis was given to physical fitness, marksmanship and fieldcraft.Guard, p.225 A large part of the training regime consisted of assault courses and route marching while military exercises included capturing and holding airborne bridgeheads, road or rail bridges and coastal fortifications. At the end of most exercises, the battalions would march back to their barracks. An ability to cover long distances at speed was also expected: airborne platoons were required to cover a distance of in twenty-four hours, and battalions . There was a wide spread rumour that started circulating about the 3rd Battalion that they would often defecate into the boots of men in other battalions as a sort of practical joke. This rumour was found to be true when an officer of the regiment discovered human excrement in his shoe, no one was found guilty of the prank however until a couple of years later where Michael Smith (1st Battalion), caught Sam Bowyer (3rd Battalion) placing human excrement into his boots.The Ups and Downs of the Third Platoon p.76 3rd Battalion The 3rd Parachute Battalion was formed in 1941 from volunteers from various infantry regiments. It became part of the 1st Parachute Brigade, later part of the 1st Airborne Division. The battalion first saw action during the Operation Torch landings, and then further operations in North Africa, by the independent 1st Parachute Brigade. After the Tunisian campaign, the battalion and brigade rejoined the 1st Airborne Division, and took part in Operation Fustian in Sicily, and Operation Slapstick on the Italian mainland. Withdrawn to Britain with the rest of the 1st Airborne Division, the next mission was during Operation Market Garden and the Battle of Arnhem, during which the battalion was virtually wiped out. Afterwards, the battalion was reformed but never saw any further action during the Second World War, though it may have gone to Norway with the initial reoccupation force in 1945. The battalion was then assigned to the 3rd Parachute Brigade in the 6th Airborne Division and served with them in Palestine. The battalion was disbanded in 1948, but was reformed by the re-numbering of the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion as the 3rd later the same year. The battalion was deployed in Northern Ireland 12 times between 1971 and 2004, during the Troubles. In the summer of 1976, it was based in South County Armagh, where complaints were made of its treatment of residents. In 1981, it joined 5th Infantry Brigade at Aldershot on the reconversion of British Army Field Forces back into brigades. In 1982, it was hurriedly transferred to 3 Commando Brigade, along with 2 PARA, to reinforce that brigade ahead of the Task Force's sailing for the Falklands Conflict. After marching 50 miles across the islands, the Battalion saw action on 11/12 June when it was engaged in the Battle of Mount Longdon. In 2006 3 PARA battle group was deployed to Helmand Province in Afghanistan. As the first NATO troops to enter Helmand they were soon engaged in some of the heaviest fighting the British Army had seen since the Korean War. 3 PARA soldiers in combat in Afghaistan during 2008 In October 2013, 3 PARA took part in a large training exercise to return to the Airborne Assault role. In September 2014, a comprehensive history of the battalion, with numerous links to photos, obituaries and more was found - the creation of Paradata, a 'living history' of the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces 3 PARA trained with its anti-tank platoon to take on the AATF role from May 2014, with the unit’s airborne infantry bolstered by artillery, engineers, medics and logisticians from 16 Air Assault Brigade. In 2018, over 80 members of 3 PARA were sent to Afghanistan as part of the Resolute Support Mission, to protect military and civilian advisors working in government ministries and work as advisors at the Afghan National Army Officers' Academy, alongside the 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles.

Adolf Klose (1844–1923) was the chief engineer of the Royal Württemberg State Railways in southern Germany from June 1885 to 1896. Klose was born on 21 May 1844 in Bernstadt auf dem Eigen, in Saxony. Before his taking up his post in Stuttgart he had been the technical inspector of the United Swiss Railways (Vereinigten Schweizerbahnen). After a period of depending on Prussian prototypes between 1865 and 1885, a new engineering direction followed under Klose's time in office. It was stamped by numerous home-grown ideas and discoveries. In particular he promoted the introduction of compound working for steam locomotives in Württemberg. The patented Klose steering (Klose- Lenkwerk) carries his name. This was a multipartite and complex device for steam locomotives, which controlled the radial setting of leading and trailing wheelsets in order to improve curve running. Unfortunately, its costly maintenance and tendency to develop faults meant that his invention had no lasting success, something which was true of many other of his devices. In 1906, Rudolf Diesel, Adolf Klose and the steam and diesel engine manufacturer Gebrüder Sulzer founded Gesellschaft für Thermolokomotiven, Diesel-Klose- Sulzer GmbH for the manufacture of diesel-powered locomotives. The company produced one diesel-mechanical locomotive for the Prussian State Railways in 1912. Adolf Klose died on 2 September 1923 in Munich, Bavaria.

Modern ruins is a neologism referring to the ruins of architecture constructed in the recent past, generally in the most recent century, or since the 19th century. The term is most frequently used by people performing urban exploration of man-made architecture that is abandoned or no longer accessible to the general public, such as structures abandoned through the process of urban decay. Enough documentation on these sites may have been lost over time that this unscientific exploration resembles archaeology of ancient ruins in the methods used to collect information. High-profile modern ruins include amusement parks, grain elevators, factories, power plants, missile silos, fallout shelters, hospitals, asylums, schools, poor houses and sanatoriums. Popularity Many sightseers find decay of uninhabited space to be profoundly beautiful, and some are also skilled freelance photographers who document what they see, as is the case with those who document some of the infrastructure of the former USSR. Ventures into abandoned structures are perhaps the most common example of urban exploration. At times, sites are entered first by locals and may suffer from large amounts of graffiti and other acts of vandalism, while other locations may be better preserved. In Japan, abandoned infrastructure is known as (literally \\"ruins\\"), but the term is synonymous with the practice of urban exploration. are particularly common in Japan because of its rapid industrialization (e.g., Hashima Island), damage during World War II, the 1980s real estate bubble, and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.  Archaeology  The archaeological study of modern ruins is most commonly associated with contemporary, urban, and industrial archaeology. The processes and goals involved in the archaeological study of modern ruins is very similar to that of other branches of archaeology that primarily focus on studying sites of earlier time periods. Particular field methods used include meticulous surveying, excavation, and record keeping, all of which are generally similar to archaeology concerning older, buried sites. However, it has been argued that the archaeological approach to modern ruins should be more embodied and visually well rounded, rather than simply communicating information by conventional site descriptions and reports. Photography, for example, is often used as a medium to communicate discoveries made in modern ruins as well as in contemporary archaeological sites in general since most of the artifacts are found above ground level. Modern ruins are often considered to be representative of accelerated rate of change, not only of their material and structural makeup or past purpose but also in many cases of society as a whole.. For example, Pyramiden, a former Soviet mining town located in the High Arctic, has frequently been a subject of archaeological study. Having over 1,000 inhabitants during its peak, Pyramiden was abandoned in 1998. Today, devoid of all humans, Pyramiden exists as a Soviet-era ghost town with the buildings and their contents remaining largely as they did when the town was inhabited. Elin Andreassen, Hein B. Bjerck, and Bjørnar Olsen, archaeologists who have studied Pyramiden, have written, “as a site of remembrance-or rather unforgetting-the memories it holds become inseparable from its materiality and from things’ unique ability to bring forth these memories.”. Understanding why a particular structure was abandoned or has become no longer accessible to the general public is key to interpreting the archaeological material that is exhibited in modern ruins. Archaeologists who study modern ruins focus on understanding several key questions. For example, archaeologists try to answer how materials found at the site got where they were ultimately discovered. Was the material that was found originally part of the same assemblage and context, or did later occupants add to what was found?.

In 1969, the credit union had an opportunity to further expand with the passage of government legislation that allowed credit unions to change its charters. Members would now be eligible for lifetime membership even if they left the qualifying field of membership. Because of this, the credit union was able to retain its members and open its membership to retired Navy department civilians. In April 1972, the credit union changed its name to the Naval Air Norfolk Federal Credit Union. It also merged with Radron Credit Union to expand its field of membership to include the Cape Charles Air Force Station and anyone in the military who used either base. In March 1983, the credit union changed its name again to Naval Air Federal Credit Union. In 1996, the credit union became Chartway Federal Credit Union. Because there were branches in many different states and a much broader field of membership, the name “Chartway” was chosen because it reflected the members loyalty and a dynamic new course. In 2010, HeritageWest Credit Union and SouthWest Community Credit Union joined the Chartway family and Utah Central Credit Union became part of the organization in 2011. Together, they proudly serve members as Chartway Federal Credit Union. Membership Chartway serves members in Texas, Utah, and Virginia. References Berry, Carolyn.

Born in Ffrwd, near Wrexham, Powell began his football career with Druids in 1879, with whom he won the Welsh Cup three times and reached the final twice more.Dykes (1994), p. 308. In October 1883, he joined Bolton Wanderers, becoming the first Welsh player to move to England in pursuit of a professional football career; however, professionalism was not legalised until July 1885, and he had to leave the club after 21 months. After moving to Manchester to become a fitter with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway at their carriage and wagon works in Newton Heath, he joined the company's football team and played in their first major competitive fixture, an FA Cup First Round tie away to Fleetwood Rangers on 30 October 1886; the match finished in a 2–2 draw, but Newton Heath were eliminated after refusing to play extra time.Dykes (1994), p. 307–8. Powell quickly became the club's first-choice right-back and was made club captain in 1887. He played in all but one match in Newton Heath's first season of organised league football in 1888–89, when they were awarded The Combination title despite not all the teams having completed their fixture schedules. The following year, Newton Heath's first season in the Football Alliance, Powell and his fellow full-back John Mitchell switched sides, with Powell taking over at left-back. However, it proved to be Powell's last full season with the club, as he only played four more games in 1890–91, his final competitive appearance coming in the FA Cup Second Round Qualifying defeat to Bootle Reserves on 25 October 1890. He was replaced as captain by George Evans, before retiring at the end of the season. Over the span of his career, Powell made 15 appearances for Wales, five of them while with Newton Heath. After his retirement from football, Powell continued to work for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway before becoming a pub licensee in Manchester and later Wrexham.

United States, 463 U.S. 354 (1983), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the court, for the first time, addressed whether the due process requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment allows defendants, who were found not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) of a misdemeanor crime, to be involuntarily confined to a mental institution until such times as they are no longer a danger to themselves or others with few other criteria or procedures limiting the actions of the state.Jones v. United States, . Background Historically, those persons acquitted of a crime by reason of insanity (insanity acquittees) were subjected to commitment procedures to institutions for the \\"criminally insane\\" with little attention or oversight provided as to what these procedures were. In the early 1970s, the procedures began to be examined legally on constitutional as well as therapeutic grounds. At that time, U.S. state jurisdictions had varying criteria and procedures governing this situation. In some states, insanity acquittees were governed by the same rules and procedures as an individual facing civil commitment. Another group of states, although treating insanity acquittees in a generally similar fashion as the civilly committed, had more stringent criteria governing insanity acquittees; for example, in emergency commitment proceedings in which a civilly committed person may be committed for a maximum of one week, an insanity acquittee may be committed on an emergency basis for 90 days—and then the discharge would take place only after judicial approval. A third group subjected an insanity acquittee to automatic, indefinite commitment, usually with periodic reviews to determine if commitment continued to be necessary. Facts of the case On September 19, 1975, Michael Jones was charged with petit larceny, a misdemeanor, for attempting to steal a jacket from a Washington, D.C. department store. Upon arraignment in the District of Columbia Superior Court, the judge ordered a competency evaluation at St. Elizabeth's Hospital. The competency report to the court was that Jones suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, but that he was competent to proceed to trial. Eventually, Jones plead not guilty by reason of insanity to the misdemeanor offense, which carried a one year maximum sentence; the prosecution did not contest the plea and Jones was automatically committed to St. Elizabeth's for a minimum of 50 days. Upon his first release hearing in May 1976, his request for release was denied. In his second release hearing held in February 1977, his request for either release or civil commitment was also denied, despite the contention of Jones' counsel that his cumulative hospitalization exceeded the maximum penalty of a one year incarceration for the crime. For the government's case, a psychologist from St. Elizabeth's Hospital testified that, in the opinion of the hospital's staff, Jones continued to actively suffer from paranoid schizophrenia and therefore remained a danger to himself and others. Appeals The case was appealed to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which affirmed the lower court's decision, although three judges dissented. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court. Decision The Supreme Court examined two issues. The first was whether there was a constitutional basis for the practice in most states, and the District of Columbia, of automatically committing insanity acquitees. The court found that there was. Justice Powell, writing for the court, said that Jones' verdict established that he committed the crime and that he did so because he was mentally ill by a preponderance of evidence. \\"Congress has determined that a criminal defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity in the District of Columbia should be committed indefinitely to a mental institution for treatment and the protection of society.\\" The second issue was the proportionality of the commitment compared to Jones' hypothetical maximum sentence had he been imprisoned; that is, does the maximum sentence provide a constitutional limit for Jones' commitment? Although three judges at the District Court level had agreed that the constitution does provide such a limit, the Supreme Court rejected this line of thinking. Writing for the majority, Powell argued that different considerations go into the choosing of a sentence than those underlying a commitment of an insanity acquittee. He argued against the idea that indefinite commitment amounted to punishment. > Indefinite commitment of an insanity acquittee, based on proof of insanity > by only a preponderance of the evidence, comports with due process. > Addington v. Texas (1979) held that the government, in a civil commitment > proceeding, must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the > individual is mentally ill and dangerous. However, the concerns critical to > that decision—based on the risk of error that a person might be committed > for mere \\"idiosyncratic behavior\\"—are diminished or absent in the case of > insanity acquitees, and do not require the same standard of proof in both > cases. Proof that the acquittee committed a criminal act as a result of > mental illness eliminates the risk that he is being committed for mere > idiosyncratic behavior.

For her work as a director, she has been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. Foster began her professional career as a child model when she was three years old, and she made her acting debut in 1968 in the television sitcom Mayberry R.F.D. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she worked in several television series and made her film debut with Disney's Napoleon and Samantha (1972). Following appearances in the musical Tom Sawyer (1973) and Martin Scorsese's comedy-drama Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), Foster's breakthrough came with Scorsese's psychological thriller Taxi Driver (1976), in which she played a child prostitute; she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other roles as a teenager include the musical Bugsy Malone (1976) and the thriller The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane (1976), and she became a popular teen idol by starring in Disney's Freaky Friday (1976) and Candleshoe (1977), as well as Carny (1980) and Foxes (1980). After attending college at Yale, Foster struggled to transition into adult roles until she gained critical acclaim for playing a rape survivor in the legal drama The Accused (1988), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She won her second Academy Award three years later for the psychological horror The Silence of the Lambs (1991), in which she portrayed Clarice Starling. Foster made her debut as a film director the same year with Little Man Tate, and founded her own production company, Egg Pictures, in 1992. The company's first production was Nell (1994), in which she also played the title role, garnering her fourth nomination for an Academy Award. Her other successful films in the 1990s were the romantic drama Sommersby, western comedy Maverick (1994), science fiction Contact (1997), and period drama Anna and the King (1999). Foster experienced career setbacks in the early 2000s, including the cancellation of a film project and the closing down of her production company, but she then starred in four commercially successful thrillers: Panic Room (2002), Flightplan (2005), Inside Man (2006), and The Brave One (2007). She has focused on directing in the 2010s, directing the films The Beaver (2011) and Money Monster (2016), as well as episodes for Netflix television series Orange Is the New Black, House of Cards, and Black Mirror. She also starred in the films Carnage (2011), Elysium (2013), and Hotel Artemis (2018). Early life and education The Lycée Français de Los Angeles, which Foster attended Alicia Christian Foster was born on November 19, 1962, in Los Angeles, California, the youngest child of Evelyn Ella (\\"Brandy\\"; née Almond) and Lucius Fisher Foster III. Her father came from a wealthy Chicago family whose forebears included John Alden, who arrived in North America on the Mayflower in 1620.Cullen, pp. 182–183 He was a Yale University graduate, a decorated U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, and a real estate broker. He had three sons from an earlier marriage before marrying Brandy in Las Vegas in 1953. Brandy was of German heritage and grew up in Rockford, Illinois. Foster also has Irish roots, with ancestry that can be traced back to County Cork. Before her birth, Brandy and Lucius had three other children: daughters Lucinda \\"Cindy\\" Foster (born 1954) and Constance \\"Connie\\" Foster (born 1955), and son Lucius Fisher \\"Buddy\\" Foster IV (born 1957). Their marriage ended before Foster was born, and she never established a relationship with her father.\\"Jodie Foster, Reluctant Star.\\" 60 Minutes II. 1999. Retrieved April 24, 2007. Following the divorce, Brandy raised the children with her partner in Los Angeles. She worked as a publicist for film producer Arthur P.

Foster was a gifted child who learned to read at the age of three. She attended a French-language prep school, the Lycée Français de Los Angeles.

At her graduation in 1980, she delivered the valedictory address for the school's French division. Already a successful actor, Foster attended Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. She majored in literature, writing her thesis on Toni Morrison under the guidance of Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and graduated magna cum laude in 1985. She returned to Yale in 1993 to address the graduating class, and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree in 1997.Yale Bulletin and Calendar Commencement 1997 June 2–23, 1997 Volume 25, Number 33 News Stories Career=1965–1975: Early work Christopher Connelly in a publicity photo for Paper Moon (1974), one of her first starring roles Foster's career began with an appearance as the Coppertone girl in a television advertisement in 1965, when she was three years old.Sonneborn, p. 73; Cullen, pp. 183–184 Her mother had intended only for Jodie's older brother Buddy to audition, but had taken Jodie with them to the casting call, where she was noticed by the casting agents. The television spot led to more advertising work, and in 1968 to a minor appearance in the sitcom Mayberry R.F.D., in which her brother starred.Sonneborn, p. 74 In the following years Foster continued working in advertising and appeared in over 50 television shows; she and her brother became the breadwinners of the family during this time. She had recurring roles in The Courtship of Eddie's Father (1969–1971) and Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1973), and starred opposite Christopher Connelly in the short-lived Paper Moon (1974), adapted from the hit film. Foster also appeared in films, mostly for Disney. After a role in the television film Menace on the Mountain (1970), she made her feature film debut in Napoleon and Samantha (1972), playing a girl who befriends a boy, played by Johnny Whitaker, and his pet lion. She was accidentally grabbed by the lion on set, which left her with scars on her back. Her other early film work includes the Raquel Welch vehicle Kansas City Bomber (1972), the Western One Little Indian (1973), the Mark Twain adaptation Tom Sawyer (1973), and Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), in which she appeared in a supporting role as a \\"Ripple- drinking street kid\\". Foster said she loved acting as a child, and values her early work for the experience it gave her: \\"Some people get quick breaks and declare, 'I'll never do commercials! That's so lowbrow!' I want to tell them, 'Well, I'm real glad you've got a pretty face, because I worked for 20 years doing that stuff and I feel it's really invaluable; it really taught me a lot.'\\" 1976–1980: Taxi Driver and teenage stardom Foster's mother was concerned that her daughter's career would end by the time she grew out of playing children, and decided that to ensure continued work and gain greater recognition, Foster should also begin acting in films for adult audiences.Hollinger 2006, p. 141 After the minor supporting role in Alice, Scorsese cast her in the role of a child prostitute in Taxi Driver (1976).Cullen, pp. 184–185 The Los Angeles Welfare Board initially opposed 12-year-old Foster's appearing in the film due to its violent content, but relented after governor Jerry Brown intervened and a UCLA psychiatrist assessed her.Rausch, pp. 30-31; Cullen, p. 185 A social worker was required to accompany her on set and her older sister Connie acted as her stand-in in sexually suggestive scenes. Foster later commented on the controversy, saying that she hated \\"the idea that everybody thinks if a kid's going to be an actress it means that she has to play Shirley Temple or someone's little sister\\". During the filming, Foster developed a bond with co-star Robert De Niro, who saw \\"serious potential\\" in her and dedicated time rehearsing scenes with her.Rausch, p. 34 She described Taxi Driver as a life-changing experience and stated that it was \\"the first time anyone asked me to create a character that wasn't myself. It was the first time I realized that acting wasn't this hobby you just sort of did, but that there was actually some craft.\\" Taxi Driver won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival; Foster also impressed journalists when she acted as French interpreter at the press conference.Ebert, p. 14 Taxi Driver was a critical and commercial success, and earned her a supporting actress Academy Award nomination, as well as two BAFTAs, a David di Donatello and a National Society of Film Critics award. The film is considered one of the best in history by the American Film Institute and Sight & Sound, and has been preserved in the National Film Registry. Foster also acted in another film nominated for the Palme d'Or in 1976, Bugsy Malone.Brickman The British musical parodied films about Prohibition Era gangsters by having all roles played by children; Foster appeared in a major supporting role as a star of a speakeasy show. Director Alan Parker was impressed by her, saying that \\"she takes such an intelligent interest in the way the film is being made that if I had been run over by a bus I think she was probably the only person on the set able to take over as director.\\"Hollinger, p. 155 She gained several positive notices for her performance: Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that \\"at thirteen she was already getting the roles that grown-up actresses complained weren't being written for women anymore\\", Variety described her as \\"outstanding\\", and Vincent Canby of The New York Times called her \\"the star of the show\\". Foster's two BAFTAs were awarded jointly for her performances in Taxi Driver and Bugsy Malone. Her third film release in 1976 was the independent drama Echoes of a Summer, which had been filmed two years previously. The New York Times named Foster's performance as a terminally ill girl the film's \\"main strength\\" and Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune stated that she \\"is not a good child actress; she's just a good actress\\", although both reviewers otherwise panned the film. Foster's fourth film of 1976 was the Canadian- French thriller The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane, in which she starred opposite Martin Sheen.Erb, p. 96; Cullen, p. 188–189 The film combined aspects from thriller and horror genres, and showed Foster as a mysterious young girl living on her own in a small town; the performance earned her a Saturn Award.Cullen, p. 188 On November 27, she hosted Saturday Night Live, becoming the youngest person to do so until 1982. Her final film of the year was Freaky Friday, a Disney comedy commenting on the generation gap, which was \\"her first true star vehicle\\".Cullen, p. 188; Erb, p. 87; Brickman She played a tomboy teen who accidentally changes bodies with her mother; she later stated that her character's desire to become an adult was matched by her own feelings at the time, and that the film marked a \\"transitional period\\" for her when she began to grow out of child roles.Erb, p. 87 It received mainly positive reviews,Erb, p. 86 and was a box office success, gaining Foster a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. After her breakthrough year, Foster spent nine months living in France, where she starred in Moi, fleur bleue (1977) and recorded several songs for its soundtrack.Snodgrass, p. 285 Her other films released in 1977 were the Italian comedy Casotto (1977), and the Disney heist film Candleshoe (1977), which was filmed in England and co-starred veteran actors David Niven and Helen Hayes.Erb, p. 87; Cullen, p. 188; Thomson After its release, Foster did not appear in any new releases until 1980, the year she turned eighteen. She gained positive notices for her performances in Adrian Lyne's debut feature film Foxes (1980), which focuses on the lives of Los Angeles teenagers, and Carny (1980), in which she played a waitress who runs away from her former life by joining a touring carnival.Gallagher, pp. 160–168; Sonneborn, pp. 73–74; Cullen, p. 189 After filming Carny in 1979, Foster's mother felt that Foster need new photos to reflect that Foster could take adult roles, so when Foster was 16, her mother arranged Emilio Lari to do a mature, partially nude photoshoot of her at a rented estate in Los Angeles; Foster's mother and Lari's wife also stayed on the set (during the photoshoot) to protect the safety of Foster.Foster and Wagener, pp. 131-132 1981–1989: Transition to adult roles Academy Award for The Accused (1988). Her performance as a rape survivor marked her breakthrough into adult roles. Aware that child stars are often unable to successfully continue their careers into adulthood, Foster became a full-time student at Yale in fall 1980, and her acting career slowed down in the following five years.Sonneborn, pp. 73–74 Stated by Foster in this interview. She later stated that going to college was \\"a wonderful time of self-discovery\\", and changed her thoughts about acting, which she had previously thought was an unintelligent profession, but now realised that \\"what I really wanted to do was to act and there was nothing stupid about it.\\" She continued making films on her summer vacations, and during her college years appeared in O'Hara's Wife (1982), television film Svengali (1983), John Irving adaptation The Hotel New Hampshire (1984), French film The Blood of Others (1984), and period drama Mesmerized (1986), which she also co-produced.Cullen, p. 192 None of them were however successful, and Foster struggled to find work after graduating in 1985.Hollinger 2006, p. 143; Sonneborn, pp. 73–74 The neo-noir Siesta (1987), in which she appeared in a supporting role, was a failure.Cullen, p. 194; Five Corners (1987) was a moderate critical success and earned Foster an Independent Spirit Award for her performance as a woman whose sexual assaulter returns to stalk her.Cullen, p.193; Sonneborn, pp. 73–74 In 1988, Foster made her debut as a director with the episode \\"Do Not Open This Box\\" for the horror anthology series Tales from the Darkside, and in August appeared in the romantic drama Stealing Home (1988) opposite Mark Harmon. The film was a critical and commercial failure,\\"Stealing Home\\". Box Office Mojo. Retrieved April 17, 2007. with critic Roger Ebert \\"wondering if any movie could possibly be that bad\\". Foster's breakthrough into adult roles came with her performance as a rape survivor in The Accused, a drama based on a real criminal case, which was released in October 1988.Cullen, p. 194; Hollinger 2006, p. 143; Sonneborn, pp. 73–74 The film focuses on the aftermath of a gang rape and its survivor's fight for justice in the face of victim blaming. Before making the film, Foster was having doubts about whether to continue her career and planned on starting graduate studies, but decided to give acting \\"one last try\\" in The Accused. She had to audition twice for the role and was cast only after several more established actors had turned it down, as the film's producers were wary of her due to her previous failures and because she was still remembered as a \\"chubby teenager\\".Sonneborn, p. 74; Hollinger 2012, p. 45; Cullen, p. 194 Due to the heavy subject matter, the filming was a difficult experience for all cast and crew involved, especially the shooting of the rape scene, which took five days to complete. Foster was unhappy with her performance, and feared that it would end her career.Hollinger 2012, p. 46 However, The Accused received positive reviews, with Foster's performance receiving widespread acclaimHollinger 2012, p. 45 and earning her Academy, Golden Globe and National Board of Review awards, as well as a nomination for a BAFTA Award. 1990–1999: Box office success, debut as director and Egg Pictures Foster at the 62nd Academy Awards in 1990 Foster's first film release after the success of The Accused was the thriller The Silence of the Lambs (1991). She portrayed FBI trainee Clarice Starling, who is sent to interview incarcerated serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in order to hunt another serial killer, Jame \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Gumb (Ted Levine). Foster later named the role one of her favorites. She had read the novel it was based on after its publication in 1988 and had attempted to purchase its film rights,Martin, p. 179 as it featured \\"a real female heroine\\" and its plot was not \\"about steroids and brawn, [but] about using your mind and using your insufficiencies to combat the villain.\\" Despite her enthusiasm, director Jonathan Demme did not initially want to cast her, but the producers overruled him. Demme's view of Foster changed during the production, and he later credited her for helping him define the character. Released in February 1991, The Silence of the Lambs became one of the biggest hits of the year, grossing close to $273 million,\\"Silence of the Lambs\\". Box Office Mojo. Retrieved March 16, 2009.\\"Jodie Foster\\". Box Office Mojo. Retrieved March 16, 2009. with a positive critical reception. Foster received largely positive reviews and won Academy, Golden Globe, and BAFTA awards for her portrayal of Starling; Silence won five Academy Awards overall, becoming one of the few films to win in all main categories. In contrast, some reviewers criticized the film as misogynist for its focus on brutal murders of women, and homophobic due to its portrayal of \\"Buffalo Bill\\" as bisexual and transgender.Hollinger 2012, pp. 46–47 Much of the criticism was directed towards Foster, whom the critics alleged was herself a lesbian. Despite the controversy, the film is considered a modern classic: Starling and Lecter are included on the American Film Institute's top ten of the greatest film heroes and villains, and the film is preserved in the National Film Registry. Later in 1991, Foster also starred in the unsuccessful low-budget thriller Catchfire, which had been filmed before Silence, but was released after it in an attempt to profit from its success. In October 1991, Foster released her first feature film as a director, Little Man Tate, a drama about a child prodigy who struggles to come to terms with being different.Foster, p. 136 The main role was played by previously unknown actor Adam Hann-Byrd, and Foster co-starred as his working-class single mother. She had found the script from the \\"slush pile\\" at Orion Pictures,Hollinger 2012, p. 49 and explained that for her debut film she \\"wanted a piece that was not autobiographical, but that had to do with the 10 philosophies I've accumulated in the past 25 years. Every single one of them, if they weren't in the script from the beginning, they're there now.\\" Although she was publicly lauded for her choice to become a director, many reviewers felt that the film itself did not live up to the high expectations, and regarded it as \\"less adventurous than many films in which [she] had starred\\".Hollinger 2012, pp. 49–51; Thomson Regardless, it was a moderate box office success. Foster's final film appearance of the year came in a small role as a prostitute in Shadows and Fog (1991), directed by Woody Allen, with whom she had wanted to collaborate since the 1970s. The following year, Foster founded her own production company, Egg Pictures, a subsidiary of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment.Hollinger 2012, p. 53; Sonneborn, p. 74 She was to produce up to six films, each with the budget of $10–25 million, in the following three years.Hollinger 2012, p. 53 Her next films were a romantic period film and a comedy, and according to film scholar Karen Hollinger, featured her in more \\"conventionally feminine\\" roles.Hollinger 2012, p. 51 She starred opposite Richard Gere in Sommersby (1993), portraying a woman who begins to suspect that her husband who returns home from the Civil War is in fact an impostor. She then replaced Meg Ryan in the Western comedy Maverick (1994), playing a con artist opposite Mel Gibson and James Garner. Both films were box office hits, earning over $140 and $183 million respectively. Foster's first project for Egg Pictures, Nell, was released in December 1994. In addition to acting as its producer, she starred in the title role as a woman who grew up isolated in the Appalachian Mountains and speaks her own invented language. It was based on Mark Handley's play Idioglossia, which interested Foster for its theme of \\"otherness\\", and because she \\"loved this idea of a woman who defies categorization, a creature who is labeled and categorized by people based on their own problems and their own prejudices and what they bring to the table.\\" It was a major commercial success, grossing over $106 million worldwide on a $31 million budget.Hollinger 2012, p. 54 Although the film received mixed reviews, Foster's performance was widely acclaimed; she won a Screen Actors Guild Award and was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Home for the Holidays, 1995 The second film that Foster directed was Home for the Holidays, released in 1995. It starred Holly Hunter and Robert Downey Jr. and was described as a black comedy \\"set around a nightmarish Thanksgiving\\". Released in November 1995, it received mixed critical response and was a commercial failure.Hollinger 2006, p. 162; Sonneborn, p. 74 The following year, Foster received two honorary awards: the Crystal Award, awarded annually for women in the entertainment industry, and the Berlinale Camera at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival. After Nell in 1994, Foster did not act in any new projects until 1997, aside from voicing characters in episodes of Frasier in 1996 and The X-Files in early 1997. She was in talks to star in David Fincher's thriller The Game, but its production company, Polygram, dropped her from the project after disagreements over her role. Foster sued the company, saying that she had an oral agreement with them to star in the film and had as a result taken \\"herself off the market\\" and lost out on other film projects. The case was later settled out of court. Foster finally made her return to the big screen in Contact (1997), a science fiction film based on a novel by Carl Sagan and directed by Robert Zemeckis. She starred as a scientist searching for extraterrestrial life in the SETI project. Due to the special effects, many of the scenes were filmed with a bluescreen; this was Foster's first experience with the technology. She commented, \\"Blue walls, blue roof. It was just blue, blue, blue. And I was rotated on a lazy Susan with the camera moving on a computerized arm. It was really tough.\\" The film was a commercial success and earned Foster a Saturn Award and a nomination for a Golden Globe. Foster's next project was producing Jane Anderson's television film The Baby Dance (1998) for Showtime. Its story deals with a wealthy California couple who struggle with infertility and decide to adopt from a poor family in Louisiana. On her decision to produce for television, Foster stated that it was easier to take financial risks in that medium than in feature films. In 1998, she also moved her production company from PolyGram to Paramount Pictures. Foster's last film of the 1990s was the period drama Anna and the King (1999), in which she starred opposite Chow Yun-Fat. It was based on a fictionalized biography of British teacher Anna Leonowens, who taught the children of King Mongkut of Siam, and whose story became well known as the musical The King and I. Foster was paid $15 million to portray Leonowens, making her one of the highest-paid female actors in Hollywood. The film was subject to controversy when the Thai government deemed it historically inaccurate and insulting to the royal family and banned its distribution in the country. It was a moderate commercial success,\\"Anna and the King\\". Box Office Mojo. but received mixed to negative reviews. Roger Ebert panned the film, stating that the role required Foster \\"to play beneath [her] intelligence\\" and The New York Times called it a \\"misstep\\" for her and accused her of only being \\"interested ... in sanctifying herself as an old-fashioned heroine than in taking on dramatically risky roles\\". 2000–2009: Career setbacks and resurgence Foster's first project of the new decade was Keith Gordon's film Waking the Dead (2000), which she produced. She declined to reprise her role as Clarice Starling in Hannibal (2001), with the part going instead to Julianne Moore, and concentrated on a new directorial project, Flora Plum. It was to focus on a 1930s circus and star Claire Danes and Russell Crowe, but had to be shelved after Crowe was injured on set and could not complete filming on schedule; Foster unsuccessfully attempted to revive the project several times in the following years. Controversially, she also expressed interest in directing and starring in a biopic of Nazi film director Leni Riefenstahl, who did not like the idea. In addition to these setbacks, Foster shut down Egg Pictures in 2001, stating that producing was \\"just a really thankless, bad job\\". The company's last production, The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2002. It received good reviews,Hollinger 2006, p. 162 and had a limited theatrical release in the summer. After the cancellation of Flora Plum, Foster took on the main role in David Fincher's thriller Panic Room after its intended star, Nicole Kidman, had to drop out due to an injury on set. Before filming resumed, Foster was given only a week to prepare for the role of a woman who hides in a panic room with her daughter when burglars invade their home.Swallow, p. 153 It grossed over $30 million on its North American opening weekend in March 2002, thus becoming the most successful film opening of Foster's career . In addition to being a box office success, the film also received largely positive reviews. After a minor appearance in the French period drama A Very Long Engagement (2004), Foster starred in three more thrillers. The first was Flightplan (2005), in which she played a woman whose daughter vanishes during an overnight flight. It became a global box office success, but received mixed reviews. It was followed by Spike Lee's critically and commercially successful Inside Man (2006), about a bank heist on Wall Street, which co-starred Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. The third thriller, The Brave One (2007), prompted some comparisons to Taxi Driver, as Foster played a New Yorker who becomes a vigilante after her fiancé is murdered. It was not a success, but earned Foster her sixth Golden Globe nomination. Her last film role of the decade was in the children's adventure film Nim's Island (2008), in which she portrayed an agoraphobic writer opposite Gerard Butler and Abigail Breslin. It was the first comedy in which she had starred since Maverick (1994), and was a commercial success but a critical failure.\\"Nim's Island\\". Box Office Mojo. In 2009, she provided the voice for Maggie in a tetralogy episode of The Simpsons titled \\"Four Great Women and a Manicure\\". 2010–present: Focus on directing Foster with co-star Mel Gibson at the premiere of The Beaver at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival In the 2010s, Foster has focused on directing and taken fewer acting roles. In February 2011, she hosted the 36th César Awards in France, and the following month released her third feature film direction, The Beaver (2011), about a depressed man who develops an alternative personality based on a beaver hand puppet. It starred Maverick co-star Mel Gibson and featured herself, Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence in supporting roles as his family. Foster called its production \\"probably the biggest struggle of my professional career\\", partly due to the film's heavy subject matter but also due to the controversy that Gibson generated when he was accused of domestic violence and making anti-semitic, racist, and sexist statements. The film received mixed reviews, and failed the box office, largely due to this controversy.Cieply, Michael. \\"Uneven Growth for Film Studio With a Message.\\" The New York Times. June 5, 2011.. Retrieved June 6, 2011. In 2011, Foster also appeared as part of an ensemble cast with John C. Reilly, Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz in Roman Polanski's comedy Carnage, focusing on middle-class parents whose meeting to settle an incident between their sons descends into chaos. It premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival in September 2011 to mainly positive reviews and earned Foster a Golden Globe for Best Actress nomination.\\"Carnage\\". Rotten Tomatoes. Flixter. Retrieved December 16, 2011. In January 2013, Foster received the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 70th Golden Globe Awards. Her next film role was playing Secretary of Defense Delacourt opposite Matt Damon in the dystopian film Elysium (2013), which was a box office success. She also returned to television directing for the first time since the 1980s, directing the episodes \\"Lesbian Request Denied\\" (2013) and \\"Thirsty Bird\\" (2014) for Orange Is the New Black, the episode \\"Chapter 22\\" (2014) for House of Cards. and the second episode of the fourth season \\"Arkangel\\" for Black Mirror. \\"Lesbian Request Denied\\" brought her a Primetime Emmy Award nomination, and the two 2014 episodes earned her two nominations for a Directors Guild of America Award. In 2014, she also narrated the episode \\"Women in Space\\" for Makers: Women Who Make America, a PBS documentary series about women's struggle for equal rights in the United States. The following year, Foster received the Laura Ziskin Lifetime Achievement Award at the Athena Film Festival, and directed her next film, Money Monster, which stars George Clooney and Julia Roberts, and was released in May 2016. As the decade drew to a close, Foster continued to mix acting with directing. She starred together with Sterling Brown in the 2018 dystopian film Hotel Artemis. She directed the finale of the 2020 science fiction drama Tales from the Loop. Personal life Foster in 2010 In interviews, Foster rarely talks about her private life. She has explained that she \\"values privacy against all else\\" due to having spent most of her life in the public eye. She lives in Los Angeles. Foster met Cydney Bernard on the set of Sommersby (1993) and was in a relationship with her from 1993 to 2008. She has two sons, Charles (b. 1998) and Christopher (b. 2001) with Bernard. She stated in 2011 that having children made her take on fewer projects: \\"It is a big sacrifice to leave home. I want to make sure that I feel passionate about the movies I do because it is a big sacrifice... Even if you take the average movie shoot of four months – you have three weeks' prep, press duties here and abroad, dubbing and looping, magazine covers, events and premieres – that's eight months out of a year. That's a long time. If you do two movies back-to-back, you're never going to see your children.\\" Foster's sexual orientation became the subject of public discussion in 1991 when activists protesting against the alleged homophobia in The Silence of the Lambs claimed that she was a closeted lesbian in publications such as OutWeek and The Village Voice.Hollinger 2006, pp. 145–146. While she had been in a relationship with Bernard for 14 years, Foster first publicly acknowledged it in a speech at The Hollywood Reporter's \\"Women in Entertainment\\" breakfast honoring her in 2007. In 2013, she addressed her coming out in a speech after receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 70th Golden Globe Awards, which led many news outlets to describe her as gay, although some sources noted that she did not use the words \\"gay\\" or \\"lesbian\\" in her speech. In April 2014, Foster married actress and photographer Alexandra Hedison after a year of dating. Foster is an atheist but has said it is important to teach children about different religions, stating that \\"in my home, we ritualize all of them. We do Christmas. We do Shabbat on Fridays. We love Kwanzaa. I take pains to give my family a real religious basis, a knowledge, because it's being well educated. You need to know why all those wars were fought.\\" She also supports gun control. John Hinckley incident During her freshman year at Yale in 1980–1981, Foster was stalked by John W. Hinckley, Jr., who had developed an obsession with her after watching Taxi Driver.Sonneborn, p. 74; Ewing & McCann, pp. 91–102 He moved to New Haven and tried to contact her, both through letters and by phone. On March 30, 1981, Hinckley attempted to assassinate U.S. President Ronald Reagan, wounding him and three other people, claiming that his motive was to impress Foster. The incident attracted intense media attention, and she had to be accompanied by bodyguards while she was on campus. Although Judge Barrington D. Parker confirmed that Foster was wholly innocent in the case and had been \\"unwittingly ensnared in a third party's alleged attempt to assassinate an American President\\", she was required to give videotaped testimony, which was played at the trial. During her time at Yale, Foster also had other stalkers, including Edward Richardson, who planned to murder her but changed his mind after watching her perform in a college play. The experience was difficult for Foster, and she has rarely commented publicly about it. In the aftermath of the events, she wrote an essay, \\"Why Me?\\", which was published in 1982 by Esquire on the condition that \\"there be no cover lines, no publicity and no photos\\". In 1991, she canceled an interview with NBC's Today Show when she discovered Hinckley would be mentioned in the introduction, and the producers were unwilling to change it. She discussed Hinckley with Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes II in 1999, explaining that she does not \\"like to dwell on it too much... I never wanted to be the actress who was remembered for that event. Because it didn't have anything to do with me. I was kind of a hapless bystander. But... what a scarring, strange moment in history for me, to be 17 years old, 18 years old, and to be caught up in a drama like that.\\" She stated that the incident had a major impact on her career choices, and acknowledged that her experience was minimal compared to the suffering of Reagan's press secretary James Brady, who was permanently disabled in the shooting and died as a result of his injuries 33 years later, and his loved ones: \\"whatever bad moments that I had certainly could never compare to that family\\".

In 2004 he was sentenced to 32 years imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for crimes committed during the Bosnian War. The sentence, which he is serving in Denmark, was reduced by two years on appeal in 2008. Early life He was born on 9 February 1948 in Čelinac, SR Bosnia Herzegovina, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. A civil engineer by profession, he worked in the building trade until 1990. At that time, given the difficulty to maintain the unity of Yugoslavia, certain regions in Bosnia Herzegovina began to organise themselves into regional structures based on the concept of Municipality Assemblies such as existed under the 1974 Yugoslavian Constitution. The Municipal Assembly of Bosanska Krajina, based in Banja Luka, was created in April and May 1991. Brđanin was its first vice-president.Profile , trial-ch.org; accessed 27 June 2015. War crimes On 9 January 1992, the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was proclaimed and re-baptised as the Republika Srpska on 12 August 1992. The leaders of the SDS felt the large Bosniak and Croatian population, living in the zones they had claimed as part of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, presented a major obstacle to the establishment of their State. The establishment of this State and the protection of its boundaries therefore implied, in time, the complete evacuation, or \\"ethnic cleansing\\", of practically all Bosnian Bosniaks and Croats. Crises groups were formed to act as organs of coordination and execution of the main elements of the operational phase of the plan and to take over the administration of the regions and the municipalities. The Autonomous Region of Krajina (ARK) Crisis Staff was set up on 5 May 1992 with Brdjanin as its President. Brđanin played a role of the first order in the campaign to create an ethnically pure Serb State. His position enabled him to facilitate the ethnic cleansing by putting all of the instruments of State power (media, central administration, housing authority, health service, police, legal system, means of production and employment) in the hands of the governing bodies and those persons committed to an ethnically pure Serb State. He purportedly signed the decisions and orders of the Crisis Staff of the ARK, which in turn instructed and compelled the municipal Crisis Staffs into taking action. Certain members of these cells participated directly in carrying out the alleged crimes: persecutions, deportations, murders, torture, destruction.Profile, icty.org; accessed 27 June 2015. Brđanin was arrested by the SFOR on 6 July 1999 and transferred on the same day to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Judgment and conviction Brđanin made an initial appearance before the ICTY on 12 July 1999. He pleaded not guilty to the twelve counts of indictment brought against him including those of genocide and extermination. The Trial Chamber of the ICTY was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that during the period covered in the Indictment and already before then, Brđanin was a leading political figure in the ARK and held key positions. He played a significant political role on all three levels of the Bosnian Serb leadership: municipal, regional and republic.Brdjanin judgement, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia; accessed 29 April 2015. The Trial Chamber was satisfied that Brđanin shared with the Bosnian Serb leadership support for the Strategic Plan, intended to link Serb-populated areas in BiH together, to gain control over these areas and to create a separate Bosnian Serb state, from which most non-Serbs would be permanently removed. The ICTY highlighted that he knew the Strategic Plan could only be implemented by the use of force and fear. On 1 September 2004, Brđanin was sentenced by the Trial Chamber of the ICTY to 32 years imprisonment. The Tribunal found him guilty of the following counts on the grounds of his individual criminal responsibility (Art. 7 § 1 Statute): #Crimes against humanity (Art. 5 Statute: torture, deportation and forced transfer considered as an inhumane act) #Serious breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (Art 2 Statute: wilful killing torture) #Violations of the laws or customs of war (Art 3 Statute: wanton destruction of cities, towns and villages or devastation not justified by military necessity; destruction or willful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion.) On 22 September 2004, Brđanin filed an appeal against this judgement. On 3 April 2007, the Appeals Chamber reversed the finding of the Trial Chamber that Brđanin's conduct had a substantial effect on the commission of torture in detention camps on grounds of lack of evidence. The Appeals Chamber also reversed Brđanin's conviction for wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity to the extent that this conviction relates to the municipality of Bosanska Krupa. In light of the reduction of convictions, the Appeals Chamber reduced Brđanin's sentence by two years. He was transferred to Denmark on 4 March 2008 to serve his sentence.Profile , trial-ch.org; accessed 29 April 2015.

It was Oxford, Witney and Fairford Railway between and . History The station was opened by the East Gloucestershire Railway on 15 January 1873 as part of its extension of the Witney Railway from to . Situated on the Alvescot-Clanfield road, the station served the village of Alvescot, situated less than half a mile to the north, and also the neighbouring village of Black Bourton. A small single-platform station was provided without a passing loop or signal box. Ground frames controlled the access to the two goods sidings which trailed off the single track line at the western end of the platform to serve coal staithes, cattle pens and a goods shed. A single refuge siding on the Down side lay just beyond the western end of the station. Next to the station building was a Great Western Railway-type Pagoda shed and to the rear of the building, adjacent to the station forecourt, was a goods lock-up and a brick weigh house. Unlike the Cotswold stone stations at , Bampton, Fairford and Witney, the station building at Alvescot was constructed of red brick. In 1923, the station issued 9,046 tickets and handled 424 parcels and 9,616 tons of goods. In 1944, Carterton station was opened to the east of Alverscot. During the \\"Arctic\\" winter of 1946-7, the line was severed at Alvescot when a large snow drift blocked the line. An emergency service was maintained with services running from either end of the snow-filled cutting. During the final years before closure, a British Railways employee at Alvescot made a proposal for the line's operation using diesel railcars that, he claimed, would save at least £20,000. This was to no avail as the station was closed along with the East Gloucestershire Railway on 18 June 1962. Present day  The goods yard remains occupied by G.F. Luckett, coal merchant, now supplied by road. All the station buildings have been demolished and the remainder of the site is a light industrial area. The station house still stands and is called \\"Station Bungalow\\". Large sections of trackbed between Alvescot and remain intact.

From 1878 to 1921 he held the post of curator at the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin. Between 1873 and 1893, he published a catalogue of the spiders of Westphalia: he also published numerous articles on the specimens that the museum received from various explorers and naturalists working in Africa, in China, in Japan, in Australia, etc. This publication of others' work sometimes led to disputes over priority and nomenclature, for example with Pickard- Cambridge. Alongside his zoological activities, he published many works on sexuality and, in particular, homosexuality in both the animal kingdom and in so-called \\"primitive\\" peoples, including Das gleichgeschlechtliche Leben der Kulturvölker - Ostasiaten: Chinesen, Japanese, Korea in 1906 on homosexuality in East Asian societies and in 1911 Das gleichgeschlechtliche Leben der Naturvölker on homosexuality in Africa and indigenous societies of Asia, Australia and the Americas.

History The Crown CA watermark (seen here from the reverse), found on many British colonial stamps, refers to the Crown Agents Prior to 1997, Crown Agents was a UK public statutory corporation, overseen by the British Ministry of Overseas Development. Crown Agents originated as a body conducting financial transactions for British colonies. Agents were first appointed in 1749 to transfer and account for grants made to colonies from the British Treasury. These representatives were known unofficially as 'Crown agents' from at least 1758, and were accountable to colonial governments, though selected on the recommendation of the British government. A single body was created in 1833, when the Crown agents' business was consolidated under two Joint Agents General for Crown Colonies with an office of several staff. The opening words of A W Abbott’s history A W Abbott, A Short History of the Crown Agents and their Office, (1959) were telling in the light of events to follow. “The Crown Agents have no formal Constitution and are not part of the United Kingdom Civil Service or of the United Kingdom Government machine. The Crown Agents are simply two individuals …who have been appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This amorphous status appeared to come as a total surprise to the Government in the 1970s (see below). In 1861 the office was renamed Crown Agents for the Colonies. Crown Agents' responsibilities on behalf of colonial governments included accounting for Treasury grants, purchasing supplies, recruiting certain staff and raising capital on the markets. Crown Agents also oversaw specific colonial projects, such as certain stamp issues and some infrastructure construction. As decolonisation accelerated, the office was renamed Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations in 1954, and the rules were changed to allow it to take on projects for independent states (Iraq being the first example). Crown Agents expanded its activities to include more international development projects and investment management. The world's first sovereign wealth funds were managed by Crown Agents. In 1967 the Crown Agents began to act as a principal, in addition to its traditional agency function. Heavy involvement in property speculation and secondary banking led to the financial losses of over £200m and necessitated Government support in 1974 (See “The Property Collapse below”). Its anomalous status as an autonomous body with close links to government came into question, and in 1979 Crown Agents was brought under government control as a statutory corporation. From 1987, shifting attitudes to state ownership of business and changes in British international development strategy led the government to support full privatisation of Crown Agents. It became a private company in 1997, ending its formal ties to the British government. International development work Crown Agents is an international development company that helps countries to grow their economies, strengthen health systems and improve financial management, through consultancy, supply chain management and financial services.

The Property Collapse of 1974=Background The financial collapse of the Crown Agents, which necessitated a bail-out by the Government, was one of the most high-profile failures of the 1974 property and secondary banking crisis, and widely considered a scandal. Lord Chancellor Memorandum to Cabinet Crown Agents The Fay Report. 7th November 1977 National Archives CAB 129/198/12 https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C9948482 The decline in its traditional government business had led the Crown Agents “to consider ways of diversifying…and operating on their own account rather than acting as agents for others…So began a short but disastrous period in an otherwise long and distinguished service to others” Ireton, Barrie: Britain's International Development Policies: A History of DFID and Overseas Aid, (2013), Palgrave The move into own account trading dated back to March 1967 Sunderland, David, Managing British Colonial and Post-Colonial Development: The Crown Agents, 1914-1974 (2007) Boydell & Brewer, and by the end of the 1960s, the activities of the Agents were being publicly queried by The Sunday Times and Private Eye. By 1970, concerns were being raised in Parliament: Mrs. Judith Hart later referred back to her earlier comments that the “constitutional relationship between the Crown Agents and the Government, which was somewhat obscure”.The Minister of Overseas Development (Mrs. Judith Hart), 18 Dec 1974, Hansard The Fay Report and Tribunal The impact of the financial and property collapse on the Crown Agents’ finances became increasingly apparent during 1974 and in October John Cuckney was appointed to sort out the problems, To meet the potential financial shortfall, the Crown Agents received an £85m grant from the Government. Recognition of the severity of the Agents’ problems. the necessity for further financial support and the political ramifications led to the establishment of the Fay Committee of Enquiry in April 1975;Crown Agents: The Fay Committee of Inquiry; publication of the Fay Report, National Archives, reference OD 71/48 that Committee reported on 1st December 1977. Among its detailed findings was the estimate that losses would exceed £200m. The Fay report gives extensive detail on the Crown Agent’s activities. It was a body without effective supervision in which inexperienced officers engaged in a wide range of speculative banking and property developments on a worldwide basis. “It is manifest from the minutes of the committee that during the period from 1967 to 1974 the conduct of the affairs of the Crown Agents and. In particular, the actions of certain of its staff, lacked competence and good judgement.” ] The parliamentary debate on the Fay report in turn led to the establishment in March 1978 of a Tribunal \\"to inquire to what extent there were lapses from accepted standards of commercial or professional conduct or of public administration in relation to the operations of the Crown Agents as financiers on own account in the years 1967-1974. The Tribunal findings were submitted in March 1982. In a formal statement to the House of Commons, the Prime Minister reported that “the tribunal has identified a number of serious shortcomings that existed at that time, not only in relation to the conduct of individuals, in respect of some of whom lapses or criticisms falling short of lapses were formally specified, but also in relation to the operation of institutions and procedures.”The Prime Minister, 26 May 1982 Hansard The Investments The best-known of the Crown Agents’ investments was with the William Stern group; Stern himself became Britain’s largest ever bankrupt to date and the losses of the Crown Agents were reported to be £54m. Less well-known but also a substantial problem were the Australian property investments held under the umbrella of English and Continental Group, where losses were estimated as a possible £35m. ] There was also a commitment to a wide range of secondary banks. Margaret Reid regarded the Crown Agents’ support for them as “much the biggest and widely discussed amount of finance for the Bank of England’s Lifeboat support operation”. Institutions singled out included Triumph Investment Trust, Sterling Industrial Trust and Burston Group.Reid, Margaret: The Secondary Banking Crisis, 1973-75,(1982), Macmillan Recovery The appointment of John Cuckney in October 1974 was the first step in rescuing the Crown Agents and restoring confidence in its traditional functions. He instituted a programme of controlled disposals, realizing what he could from the property and banking investments. Probably the most intransigent were the Australian property investments which took some years to bring under the Agents full control. One of the most important organizational decisions made by Cuckney was in March 1977, concerning the Agents’ subsidiary, Millbank Technical Services. Millbank had been established in 1967 to offer services “outside their traditional agency role.”: in effect, it had become a substantial exporter of military equipment. Millbank was transferred to the Ministry of Defence, thereby returning the Agents to its traditional activity.Hansard 29 March 1977 https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/1977-03-29/debates/1373633a-4555-4fb1-befa-7a7b726dae67/MillbankTechnicalServices However, uncertainty continued over the legal status of the Crown Agents and it was not until the Crown Agents Act 1979 that the legal and constitutional position was regularized. The Act established the Agents as a corporate body under formal name of Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations. Crown Agents Act 1979, https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/43/contents Sources There are extensive sources on this period of the Crown Agents history: government, books and contemporary media. The most authoritative sources are the Fay Report and the subsequent Tribunal. These are held in The National Archives but they have not been digitized and are not therefore available online. However, there is a valuable briefing paper prepared by the Lord Chancellor for the Cabinet prior to the publication of the Fay Report. In addition, there are several ministerial statements available through Hansard. There are numerous books written about the secondary banking crisis and its participants, of which Margaret Reid’s is the best-known. David Sunderland’s book on the Crown Agents has three chapters (8-10) on this period.

Sociological Theory: Classical Statements (6th ed.). Boston: Pearson Education. to develop a body of knowledge about social order and social change. Sociology can also be defined as the general science of society. While some sociologists conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter can range from micro-level analyses of society (i.e., of individual interaction and agency) to macro-level analyses (i.e., of systems and the social structure). Traditional focuses of sociology include social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, secularization, law, sexuality, gender, and deviance. As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects and institutions, such as health and the institution of medicine; economy; military; punishment and systems of control; the Internet; education; social capital; and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge. The range of social scientific methods has also expanded, as social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-20th century, especially, have led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, the turn of the 21st century has seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically, and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis. Social research has influence throughout various industries and sectors of life, such as among politicians, policy makers, and legislators; educators; planners; administrators; developers; business magnates and managers; social workers; non-governmental organizations; and non-profit organizations, as well as individuals interested in resolving social issues in general. As such, there is often a great deal of crossover between social research, market research, and other statistical fields.  Origins  Ibn Khaldun statue in Tunis, Tunisia (1332–1406) Sociological reasoning predates the foundation of the discipline itself. Social analysis has origins in the common stock of Western knowledge and philosophy, having been carried out from as far back as the time of Old comic poetry which features social and political criticism,H Nettleship, A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (London 1894) p. 67 and ancient Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, if not earlier. For instance, the origin of the survey (i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals) can be traced back to at least the Domesday Book in 1086,Halsey, A. H. 2004. A History of Sociology in Britain: Science, Literature, and Society. p. 34.Mitchell, Geoffrey Duncan. 1970. A New Dictionary of Sociology. p. 201. while ancient philosophers such as Confucius wrote about the importance of social roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Arabic writings as well. Some sources consider Ibn Khaldun, a 14th-century Arab-Islamic scholar from Tunisia, to have been the father of sociology although there isn't reference to his work in the work of major founders of modern sociology.Soyer, Mehmet, and Paul Gilbert. 2012. \\"Debating the Origins of Sociology Ibn Khaldun as a Founding Father of Sociology.\\" International Journal of Sociological Research 5(2):13–30. — via ResearchGate. Khaldun's Muqaddimah was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on social cohesion and social conflict.  Etymology  The word sociology (or \\"sociologie\\") derives part of its name from the Latin word socius (\\"companion\\"). The suffix -logy (\\"the study of'\\") come from that of the Greek -λογία, derived from λόγος (lógos, \\"word\\" or \\"knowledge\\"). = Sieyès = The term was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès in an unpublished manuscript.Sieyès, Emmanuel- Joseph. 1999 & 2007 [1773–1799]. Des Manuscrits de Sieyès. 1773–1799 1 & 2, edited by C. Fauré. Paris: Champion. . = Comte = \\"Sociology\\" was later defined independently by French philosopher of science Auguste Comte in 1838Scott, John, and Gordon Marshall. 2015 [2009]. \\"Comte, Auguste\\" in A Dictionary of Sociology. New York: Oxford University Press. e. as a new way of looking at society. Comte had earlier used the term \\"social physics,\\" but it had been subsequently appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet. Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology, and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the French Revolution, he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological positivism, an epistemological approach outlined in the Course in Positive Philosophy (1830–1842), later included in A General View of Positivism (1848). Comte believed a positivist stage would mark the final era, after conjectural theological and metaphysical phases, in the progression of human understanding. In observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and having classified the sciences, Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term.Copleson, Frederick S.J. 1994 [1974]. A History of Philosophy: IX Modern Philosophy. New York: Image Books. p. 118. Auguste Comte (1798–1857) Karl Marx (1818–1883) = Marx = Both Comte and Karl Marx set out to develop scientifically justified systems in the wake of European industrialization and secularization, informed by various key movements in the philosophies of history and science. Marx rejected Comtean positivism but in attempting to develop a \\"science of society\\" nevertheless came to be recognized as a founder of sociology as the word gained wider meaning. For Isaiah Berlin (1967), even though Marx did not consider himself to be a sociologist, he may be regarded as the \\"true father\\" of modern sociology, \\"in so far as anyone can claim the title.\\"Berlin, Isaiah. 1967 [1937].

It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th-century thinkers, including Émile Durkheim, defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim's Division of Labour in Society is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively. Also a notable biologist, Spencer coined the term survival of the fittest. While Marxian ideas defined one strand of sociology, Spencer was a critic of socialism as well as strong advocate for a laissez-faire style of government. His ideas were closely observed by conservative political circles, especially in the United States and England.  Positivism and antipositivism Positivism= The overarching methodological principle of positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly the same manner as natural science. An emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research based on the assumption that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology. The term has long since ceased to carry this meaning; there are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism. Many of these approaches do not self-identify as \\"positivist\\", some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a pejorative term by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical empiricism. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also diverged, with many rejecting the scientific method and others only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th-century developments in the philosophy of science. However, positivism (broadly understood as a scientific approach to the study of society) remains dominant in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States. Loïc Wacquant distinguishes three major strains of positivism: Durkheimian, Logical, and Instrumental. None of these are the same as that set forth by Comte, who was unique in advocating such a rigid (and perhaps optimistic) version. While Émile Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method. Durkheim maintained that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisted that they should retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality. He developed the notion of objective sui generis \\"social facts\\" to serve as unique empirical objects for the science of sociology to study. The variety of positivism that remains dominant today is termed instrumental positivism. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as the nature of social facts) in favour of methodological clarity, replicability, reliability and validity. This positivism is more or less synonymous with quantitative research, and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to Paul Lazarsfeld, who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them. This approach lends itself to what Robert K. Merton called middle-range theory: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole. = Anti-positivism = Reactions against social empiricism began when German philosopher Hegel voiced opposition to both empiricism, which he rejected as uncritical, and determinism, which he viewed as overly mechanistic. Karl Marx's methodology borrowed from Hegelian dialecticism but also a rejection of positivism in favour of critical analysis, seeking to supplement the empirical acquisition of \\"facts\\" with the elimination of illusions. He maintained that appearances need to be critiqued rather than simply documented. Early hermeneuticians such as Wilhelm Dilthey pioneered the distinction between natural and social science ('Geisteswissenschaft'). Various neo-Kantian philosophers, phenomenologists and human scientists further theorized how the analysis of the social world differs to that of the natural world due to the irreducibly complex aspects of human society, culture, and being.Rickman, H.P. (1960) The Reaction against Positivism and Dilthey's Concept of Understanding, The London School of Economics and Political Science. p. 307 In the Italian context of development of social sciences and of sociology in particular, there are oppositions to the first foundation of the discipline, sustained by speculative philosophy in accordance with the antiscientific tendencies matured by critique of positivism and evolutionism, so a tradition Progressist struggles to establish itself. At the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological anti-positivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural norms, values, symbols, and social processes viewed from a resolutely subjective perspective. Max Weber argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify causal relationships of human \\"social action\\"—especially among \\"ideal types\\", or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena. As a non- positivist, however, Weber sought relationships that are not as \\"historical, invariant, or generalisable\\" as those pursued by natural scientists. Fellow German sociologist, Ferdinand Tönnies, theorised on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on \\"gemeinschaft and gesellschaft\\" (). Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way (\\"pure sociology\\"), whereas the second empirically and inductively (\\"applied sociology\\").Tönnies, Ferdinand. 2001. Community and Civil Society, edited by J. Harris. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . Max Weber Both Weber and Georg Simmel pioneered the \\"Verstehen\\" (or 'interpretative') method in social science; a systematic process by which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point of view.Kaern, Michael, Bernard S. Phillips, and Robert S. Cohen, eds. 1990. Georg Simmel and Contemporary Sociology. Springer Publishing. . p. 15. Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the phenomenological and existential writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality. His sociology engaged in a neo-Kantian inquiry into the limits of perception, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?'Levine, Donald. ed. 1971. Simmel: On individuality and social forms. Chicago: Chicago University Press. p. 6. Georg Simmel Foundations of the academic discipline Émile Durkheim The first formal Department of Sociology in the world was established in 1892 by Albion Small—from the invitation of William Rainey Harper—at the University of Chicago. The American Journal of Sociology was founded shortly thereafter in 1895 by Small as well.Dibble, Vernonk. 1975. The Legacy of Albion Small. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. The institutionalization of sociology as an academic discipline, however, was chiefly led by Émile Durkheim, who developed positivism as a foundation for practical social research. While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895, publishing his Rules of the Sociological Method (1895). For Durkheim, sociology could be described as the \\"science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning.\\"Durkheim, Émile. 1964 [1895] The Rules of Sociological Method (8th ed.), translated by S. A. Solovay and J. M. Mueller, edited by G. E. G. Catlin. p. 45. Durkheim's monograph Suicide (1897) is considered a seminal work in statistical analysis by contemporary sociologists. Suicide is a case study of variations in suicide rates among Catholic and Protestant populations, and served to distinguish sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy. It also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of structural functionalism. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or psychological) causes. He developed the notion of objective sui generis, \\"social facts\\", to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study. Through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or \\"social anomie\\". Sociology quickly evolved as an academic response to the perceived challenges of modernity, such as industrialization, urbanization, secularization, and the process of \\"rationalization\\".Habermas, Jürgen. 1990. The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Modernity's Consciousness of Time. Polity Press. . p. 2. The field predominated in continental Europe, with British anthropology and statistics generally following on a separate trajectory. By the turn of the 20th century, however, many theorists were active in the English-speaking world. Few early sociologists were confined strictly to the subject, interacting also with economics, jurisprudence, psychology and philosophy, with theories being appropriated in a variety of different fields. Since its inception, sociological epistemology, methods, and frames of inquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged. Durkheim, Marx, and the German theorist Max Weber are typically cited as the three principal architects of sociology. Herbert Spencer, William Graham Sumner, Lester F. Ward, W.E.B. Du Bois, Vilfredo Pareto, Alexis de Tocqueville, Werner Sombart, Thorstein Veblen, Ferdinand Tönnies, Georg Simmel, Jane Addams and Karl Mannheim are often included on academic curricula as founding theorists. Curricula also may include Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Marianne Weber, and Friedrich Engels as founders of the feminist tradition in sociology. Each key figure is associated with a particular theoretical perspective and orientation. =Further developments= Bust of Ferdinand Tönnies in Husum, Germany The first college course entitled \\"Sociology\\" was taught in the United States at Yale in 1875 by William Graham Sumner. In 1883 Lester F. Ward, who later became the first president of the American Sociological Association (ASA), published Dynamic Sociology—Or Applied social science as based upon statical sociology and the less complex sciences, attacking the laissez-faire sociology of Herbert Spencer and Sumner. Ward's 1200-page book was used as core material in many early American sociology courses. In 1890, the oldest continuing American course in the modern tradition began at the University of Kansas, lectured by Frank W. Blackmar. The Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago was established in 1892 by Albion Small, who also published the first sociology textbook: An introduction to the study of society 1894. George Herbert Mead and Charles Cooley, who had met at the University of Michigan in 1891 (along with John Dewey), moved to Chicago in 1894.Miller, David (2009). George Herbert Mead: Self, Language, and the World. University of Texas Press. . Their influence gave rise to social psychology and the symbolic interactionism of the modern Chicago School.1930: The Development of Sociology at Michigan. pp. 3–14 in Sociological Theory and Research, being Selected papers of Charles Horton Cooley, edited by Robert Cooley Angell, New York: Henry Holt The American Journal of Sociology was founded in 1895, followed by the ASA in 1905. The sociological \\"canon of classics\\" with Durkheim and Max Weber at the top owes in part to Talcott Parsons, who is largely credited with introducing both to American audiences. Parsons consolidated the sociological tradition and set the agenda for American sociology at the point of its fastest disciplinary growth. Sociology in the United States was less historically influenced by Marxism than its European counterpart, and to this day broadly remains more statistical in its approach.Morrison, Ken. 2006 Marx, Durkheim, Weber (2nd ed.). Sage. pp. 1–7. The first sociology department to be established in the United Kingdom was at the London School of Economics and Political Science (home of the British Journal of Sociology) in 1904. Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and Edvard Westermarck became the lecturers in the discipline at the University of London in 1907. Harriet Martineau, an English translator of Comte, has been cited as the first female sociologist.Hill, Michael R. (2002) \\"Harriet Martineau: theoretical and methodological perspectives\\" Routledge. In 1909 the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie (German Sociological Association) was founded by Ferdinand Tönnies and Max Weber, among others. Weber established the first department in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1919, having presented an influential new antipositivist sociology. In 1920, Florian Znaniecki set up the first department in Poland. The Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt (later to become the Frankfurt School of critical theory) was founded in 1923. International co-operation in sociology began in 1893, when René Worms founded the Institut International de Sociologie, an institution later eclipsed by the much larger International Sociological Association (ISA), founded in 1949. Theoretical traditions=Classical theory The contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic in line with the contentions of classical social theory. Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Accordingly, modern sociological theory predominantly descends from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict (Marx and Weber) approaches to social structure, as well as from symbolic-interactionist approaches to social interaction, such as micro-level structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) perspectives. Utilitarianism (aka rational choice or social exchange), although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory.Coleman, James S., and Thomas J. Fararo. 1992. Rational Choice Theory. New York: Sage. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which applies the logic of Darwinian biological evolution to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism, and was once the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology, from , associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward, and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive. =Functionalism= A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and anthropology, functionalism addresses the social structure—referred to as \\"social organization\\" by the classical theorists—with respect to the whole as well as the necessary function of the whole's constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by Herbert Spencer) is to regard norms and institutions as 'organs' that work towards the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society. The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as Marcel Mauss, Bronisław Malinowski, and Radcliffe-Brown. It is in latter's specific usage that the prefix \\"structural\\" emerged. Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of social evolutionism, in that the basic form of society would increase in complexity and those forms of social organization that promoted solidarity would eventually overcome social disorganization. As Giddens states: > Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards > biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for > social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing > the structure and the function of social systems and to analyzing processes > of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation. Functionalism strongly emphasizes > the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its > constituent actors, human subjects). =Conflict theory= Functionalist theories emphasize \\"cohesive systems\\" and are often contrasted with \\"conflict theories\\", which critique the overarching socio-political system or emphasize the inequality between particular groups. The following quotes from DurkheimDurkheim, Émile. 1984 [1893]. The Division of Labor in Society. New York: The Free Press. and MarxMarx, Karl, and Friedrich Engels. 1998 [1848]. The Communist Manifesto, introduction by M. Malia. New York: Penguin Group. p. 35. . epitomize the political, as well as theoretical, disparities, between functionalist and conflict thought respectively: =Symbolic Interactionism= Symbolic interaction—often associated with interactionism, phenomenology, dramaturgy, interpretivism—is a sociological approach that places emphasis on subjective meanings and the empirical unfolding of social processes, generally accessed through micro-analysis.Macionis, John J. 2012. Sociology (14th ed.). Boston: Pearson. p. 16. This tradition emerged in the Chicago School of the 1920s and 1930s, which, prior to World War II, \\"had been the center of sociological research and graduate study.\\"Fine, Gary Alan, ed. 1995. A Second Chicago School?: The Development of a Postwar American Sociology. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. . The approach focuses on creating a framework for building a theory that sees society as the product of the everyday interactions of individuals. Society is nothing more than the shared reality that people construct as they interact with one another. This approach sees people interacting in countless settings using symbolic communications to accomplish the tasks at hand. Therefore, society is a complex, ever-changing mosaic of subjective meanings.Macionis, John, and Linda Gerber. 2010. Sociology (7th Canadian ed.). Toronto: Pearson Canada. . Some critics of this approach argue that it only looks at what is happening in a particular social situation, and disregards the effects that culture, race or gender (i.e. social-historical structures) may have in that situation. Some important sociologists associated with this approach include Max Weber, George Herbert Mead, Erving Goffman, George Homans, and Peter Blau. It is also in this tradition that the radical- empirical approach of ethnomethodology emerges from the work of Harold Garfinkel. =Utilitarianism= Utilitarianism is often referred to as exchange theory or rational choice theory in the context of sociology. This tradition tends to privilege the agency of individual rational actors and assumes that within interactions individuals always seek to maximize their own self-interest. As argued by Josh Whitford, rational actors are assumed to have four basic elements:Whitford, Josh. 2002. \\"Pragmatism and the untenable dualism of means and ends: Why rational choice theory does not deserve paradigmatic privilege.\\" Theory & Society 31:325–63. # \\"a knowledge of alternatives;\\" # \\"a knowledge of, or beliefs about the consequences of the various alternatives;\\" # \\"an ordering of preferences over outcomes;\\" and # \\"a decision rule, to select among the possible alternatives\\" Exchange theory is specifically attributed to the work of George C. Homans, Peter Blau and Richard Emerson. Organizational sociologists James G. March and Herbert A. Simon noted that an individual's rationality is bounded by the context or organizational setting. The utilitarian perspective in sociology was, most notably, revitalized in the late 20th century by the work of former ASA president James Coleman. 20th-century social theory Following the decline of theories of sociocultural evolution in the United States, the interactionist thought of the Chicago School dominated American sociology. As Anselm Strauss describes, \\"we didn't think symbolic interaction was a perspective in sociology; we thought it was sociology.\\" After World War II, mainstream sociology shifted to the survey-research of Paul Lazarsfeld at Columbia University and the general theorizing of Pitirim Sorokin, followed by Talcott Parsons at Harvard University. Ultimately, \\"the failure of the Chicago, Columbia, and Wisconsin [sociology] departments to produce a significant number of graduate students interested in and committed to general theory in the years 1936–45 was to the advantage of the Harvard department.\\" As Parsons began to dominate general theory, his work primarily referenced European sociology—almost entirely omitting citations of both the American tradition of sociocultural-evolution as well as pragmatism. In addition to Parsons' revision of the sociological canon (which included Marshall, Pareto, Weber and Durkheim), the lack of theoretical challenges from other departments nurtured the rise of the Parsonian structural-functionalist movement, which reached its crescendo in the 1950s, but by the 1960s was in rapid decline. By the 1980s, most functionalist perspectives in Europe had broadly been replaced by conflict-oriented approaches, and to many in the discipline, functionalism was considered \\"as dead as a dodo:\\" According to Giddens:Cassell, Philip. 1993. The Giddens Reader. The Macmillan Press. p. 6. > The orthodox consensus terminated in the late 1960s and 1970s as the middle > ground shared by otherwise competing perspectives gave way and was replaced > by a baffling variety of competing perspectives. This third 'generation' of > social theory includes phenomenologically inspired approaches, critical > theory, ethnomethodology, symbolic interactionism, structuralism, post- > structuralism, and theories written in the tradition of hermeneutics and > ordinary language philosophy. =Pax Wisconsana= While some conflict approaches also gained popularity in the United States, the mainstream of the discipline instead shifted to a variety of empirically oriented middle-range theories with no single overarching, or \\"grand,\\" theoretical orientation. John Levi Martin refers to this \\"golden age of methodological unity and theoretical calm\\" as the Pax Wisconsana, as it reflected the composition of the sociology department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison: numerous scholars working on separate projects with little contention. Omar Lizardo describes the pax wisconsana as \\"a Midwestern flavored, Mertonian resolution of the theory/method wars in which [sociologists] all agreed on at least two working hypotheses: (1) grand theory is a waste of time; [and] (2) good theory has to be good to think with or goes in the trash bin.\\"http://www3.nd.edu/~olizardo/syllabi/SOC63922-syllabus-spring11.pdf Despite the aversion to grand theory in the latter half of the 20th century, several new traditions have emerged that propose various syntheses: structuralism, post-structuralism, cultural sociology and systems theory.alt= =Structuralism= The structuralist movement originated primarily from the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European scholars: Anthony Giddens, a sociologist, whose theory of structuration draws on the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure; and Claude Lévi-Strauss, an anthropologist. In this context, 'structure' does not refer to 'social structure', but to the semiotic understanding of human culture as a system of signs. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: # Structure is what determines the structure of a whole. # Structuralists believe that every system has a structure. # Structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. # Structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning. The second tradition of structuralist thought, contemporaneous with Giddens, emerges from the American School of social network analysis in the 1970s and 1980s,Turner, Jonathan H. 1991. \\"Part 5: Structural Theorizing\\" in The Structure of Sociological Theory (5th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing. spearheaded by the Harvard Department of Social Relations led by Harrison White and his students. This tradition of structuralist thought argues that, rather than semiotics, social structure is networks of patterned social relations. And, rather than Levi-Strauss, this school of thought draws on the notions of structure as theorized by Levi- Strauss' contemporary anthropologist, Radcliffe-Brown. Some refer to this as \\"network structuralism,\\" and equate it to \\"British structuralism\\" as opposed to the \\"French structuralism\\" of Levi-Strauss. =Post-structuralism= Post-structuralist thought has tended to reject 'humanist' assumptions in the construction of social theory.Giddens, Anthony. \\"The Constitution of Society\\" in The Giddens Reader, edited by P. Cassell. MacMillan Press. p. 89. Michel Foucault provides an important critique in his Archaeology of the Human Sciences, though Habermas (1986) and Rorty (1986) have both argued that Foucault merely replaces one such system of thought with another.Habermas, Jürgen. 1986. \\"Taking Aim at the Heart of the Present.\\" In Foucault: A Critical Reader, edited by D. Hoy. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.Rorty, Richard. 1986. \\"Foucault and Epistemology.\\" In Foucault: A Critical Reader, edited by D. Hoy. Oxford: Basil Blackwell. The dialogue between these intellectuals highlights a trend in recent years for certain schools of sociology and philosophy to intersect. The anti-humanist position has been associated with \\"postmodernism\\", a term used in specific contexts to describe an era or phenomena, but occasionally construed as a method. Central theoretical problems Overall, there is a strong consensus regarding the central problems of sociological theory, which are largely inherited from the classical theoretical traditions. This consensus is: how to link, transcend or cope with the following \\"big three\\" dichotomies:Archer, Margaret S., and Jonathan Q. Tritt. 2013. Rational Choice Theory: Resisting Colonisation, edited by J. Q. Tritt. Routledge. . # subjectivity and objectivity, which deal with knowledge; # structure and agency, which deal with action; # and synchrony and diachrony, which deal with time. Lastly, sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro, meso, and macro-scale social phenomena, which is a subset of all three central problems. Subjectivity and objectivity The problem of subjectivity and objectivity can be divided into two parts: a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists, then, is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective- subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ. The latter concern with scientific knowledge results from the fact that a sociologist is part of the very object they seek to explain, as Bourdieu explains: Structure and agency Structure and agency, sometimes referred to as determinism versus voluntarism, form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: \\"Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?\\" In this context, agency refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas structure relates to factors that limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (e.g. social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, etc.). Discussions over the primacy of either structure or agency relate to the core of sociological epistemology (i.e., \\"what is the social world made of?\\", \\"what is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?\\"). A perennial question within this debate is that of \\"social reproduction\\": how are structures (specifically, structures producing inequality) reproduced through the choices of individuals? Synchrony and diachrony Synchrony and diachrony (or statics and dynamics) within social theory are terms that refer to a distinction that emerged through the work of Levi-Strauss who inherited it from the linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure. Synchrony slices moments of time for analysis, thus it is an analysis of static social reality. Diachrony, on the other hand, attempts to analyse dynamic sequences. Following Saussure, synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a language, while diachrony would refer to unfolding processes like actual speech. In Anthony Giddens' introduction to Central Problems in Social Theory, he states that, \\"in order to show the interdependence of action and structure…we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction.\\" And like structure and agency, time is integral to discussion of social reproduction. In terms of sociology, historical sociology is often better positioned to analyse social life as diachronic, while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronized. Some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim. Nonetheless, the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording and thinking about social data. Research methodology Many people divide sociological research methods into two broad categories, although many others see research methods as a continuum: * Quantitative designs approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to establish valid and reliable general claims. * Qualitative designs emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality. Sociologists are often divided into camps of support for particular research techniques. These disputes relate to the epistemological debates at the historical core of social theory. While very different in many aspects, both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between theory and data. Quantitative methodologies hold the dominant position in sociology, especially in the United States. In the discipline's two most cited journals, quantitative articles have historically outnumbered qualitative ones by a factor of two. (Most articles published in the largest British journal, on the other hand, are qualitative.) Most textbooks on the methodology of social research are written from the quantitative perspective, and the very term \\"methodology\\" is often used synonymously with \\"statistics.\\" Practically all sociology PhD programmes in the United States require training in statistical methods. The work produced by quantitative researchers is also deemed more 'trustworthy' and 'unbiased' by the general public, though this judgment continues to be challenged by antipositivists. The choice of method often depends largely on what the researcher intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods as part of a 'multi- strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to obtain statistical patterns on a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency. Sampling The bean machine, designed by early social research methodologist Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the normal distribution, which is important to much quantitative hypothesis testing. Quantitative methods are often used to ask questions about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling. Methods The following list of research methods is neither exclusive nor exhaustive: * Archival research (or the Historical method): Draws upon the secondary data located in historical archives and records, such as biographies, memoirs, journals, and so on. * Content analysis: The content of interviews and other texts is systematically analysed. Often data is 'coded' as a part of the 'grounded theory' approach using qualitative data analysis (QDA) software, such as Atlas.ti, MAXQDA, NVivo, or QDA Miner. * Experimental research: The researcher isolates a single social process and reproduces it in a laboratory (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking to determine whether or not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment. * Longitudinal study: An extensive examination of a specific person or group over a long period of time. * Observation: Using data from the senses, the researcher records information about social phenomenon or behaviour. Observation techniques may or may not feature participation. In participant observation, the researcher goes into the field (e.g. a community or a place of work), and participates in the activities of the field for a prolonged period of time in order to acquire a deep understanding of it. Data acquired through these techniques may be analysed either quantitatively or qualitatively. In the observation research, a sociologist might study global warming in some part of the world that is less populated. * Survey research: The researcher gathers data using interviews, questionnaires, or similar feedback from a set of people sampled from a particular population of interest. Survey items from an interview or questionnaire may be open-ended or closed-ended. Data from surveys is usually analysed statistically on a computer. * Program Evaluation is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs,Administration for Children and Families (2010) The Program Manager's Guide to Evaluation. Chapter 2: What is program evaluation?. particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, or objecting to are producing the intended effect. While program evaluation first focuses on this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful. Computational sociology A social network diagram: individuals (or 'nodes') connected by relationships Sociologists increasingly draw upon computationally intensive methods to analyse and model social phenomena.Bainbridge, William Sims 2007. \\"Computational Sociology.\\" In Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology, edited by G. Ritzer. Blackwell Reference Online. . . Using computer simulations, artificial intelligence, text mining, complex statistical methods, and new analytic approaches like social network analysis and social sequence analysis, computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom-up modelling of social interactions. Although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or computer science, several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as physics and artificial intelligence. By the same token, some of the approaches that originated in computational sociology have been imported into the natural sciences, such as measures of network centrality from the fields of social network analysis and network science. In relevant literature, computational sociology is often related to the study of social complexity. Social complexity concepts such as complex systems, non-linear interconnection among macro and micro process, and emergence, have entered the vocabulary of computational sociology. A practical and well-known example is the construction of a computational model in the form of an \\"artificial society\\", by which researchers can analyse the structure of a social system. Subfields=Culture Max Horkheimer (left, front), Theodor Adorno (right, front), and Jürgen Habermas (right, back) 1965 Sociologists' approach to culture can be divided into \\"sociology of culture\\" and \\"cultural sociology\\"—terms which are similar, though not entirely interchangeable. Sociology of culture is an older term, and considers some topics and objects as more or less \\"cultural\\" than others. Conversely, cultural sociology sees all social phenomena as inherently cultural. Sociology of culture often attempts to explain certain cultural phenomena as a product of social processes, while cultural sociology sees culture as a potential explanation of social phenomena. For Simmel, culture referred to \\"the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history.\\" While early theorists such as Durkheim and Mauss were influential in cultural anthropology, sociologists of culture are generally distinguished by their concern for modern (rather than primitive or ancient) society. Cultural sociology often involves the hermeneutic analysis of words, artefacts and symbols, or ethnographic interviews. However, some sociologists employ historical-comparative or quantitative techniques in the analysis of culture, Weber and Bourdieu for instance. The subfield is sometimes allied with critical theory in the vein of Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, and other members of the Frankfurt School. Loosely distinct from the sociology of culture is the field of cultural studies. Birmingham School theorists such as Richard Hoggart and Stuart Hall questioned the division between \\"producers\\" and \\"consumers\\" evident in earlier theory, emphasizing the reciprocity in the production of texts. Cultural Studies aims to examine its subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power. For example, a study of a subculture (e.g. white working class youth in London) would consider the social practices of the group as they relate to the dominant class. The \\"cultural turn\\" of the 1960s ultimately placed culture much higher on the sociological agenda. =Art, music and literature= Sociology of literature, film, and art is a subset of the sociology of culture. This field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire (1992).Bourdieu, Pierre. 1996 [1992]. Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field (Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire), translated by S. Emanuel. None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Theodor Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim. Criminality, deviance, law and punishment Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, and control of criminal activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both infringements of formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; and how they are enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance. =Sociology of law= The study of law played a significant role in the formation of classical sociology. Durkheim famously described law as the \\"visible symbol\\" of social solidarity.Banakar, Reza. 2009. \\"Law Through Sociology's Looking Glass: Conflict and Competition in Sociological Studies of Law.\\" Pp. 58–73 in The New ISA Handbook in Contemporary International Sociology: Conflict, Competition, and Cooperation, edited by A. Denis and D. Kalekin-Fishman. London: Sage. The sociology of law refers to both a sub- discipline of sociology and an approach within the field of legal studies. Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with other aspects of society, such as the development of legal institutions and the effect of laws on social change and vice versa. For example, an influential recent work in the field relies on statistical analyses to argue that the increase in incarceration in the US over the last 30 years is due to changes in law and policing and not to an increase in crime; and that this increase has significantly contributed to the persistence of racial stratification. Communications and information technologies The sociology of communications and information technologies includes \\"the social aspects of computing, the Internet, new media, computer networks, and other communication and information technologies.\\" =Internet and digital media= The Internet is of interest to sociologists in various ways; most practically as a tool for research and as a discussion platform.Wilson, D. R. 2004. Researching Sociology on the Internet. London: Thomson/Wadsworth. . The sociology of the Internet in the broad sense concerns the analysis of online communities (e.g. newsgroups, social networking sites) and virtual worlds, meaning that there is often overlap with community sociology. Online communities may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through new media, thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an informational society. One notable text is Manuel Castells' The Internet Galaxy—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy.Castells, Manuel. 2001. The Internet Galaxy: Reflections on the Internet, Business and Society. Oxford, Oxford University Press. Closely related to the sociology of the Internet is digital sociology, which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since the first decade of the twenty-first century. =Media= As with cultural studies, media study is a distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though neither the production process nor the critique of aesthetic forms is in the remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often indispensable topic. Economic sociology The term \\"economic sociology\\" was first used by William Stanley Jevons in 1879, later to be coined in the works of Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel between 1890 and 1920. Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena, emphasizing class relations and modernity as a philosophical concept. The relationship between capitalism and modernity is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905) and Simmel's The Philosophy of Money (1900). The contemporary period of economic sociology, also known as new economic sociology, was consolidated by the 1985 work of Mark Granovetter titled \\"Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness\\". This work elaborated the concept of embeddedness, which states that economic relations between individuals or firms take place within existing social relations (and are thus structured by these relations as well as the greater social structures of which those relations are a part). Social network analysis has been the primary methodology for studying this phenomenon. Granovetter's theory of the strength of weak ties and Ronald Burt's concept of structural holes are two of the best known theoretical contributions of this field. =Work, employment, and industry= The sociology of work, or industrial sociology, examines \\"the direction and implications of trends in technological change, globalization, labour markets, work organization, managerial practices and employment relations to the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families the ways in which workers challenge, resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions.\\"Watson, Tony J. 2008. Sociology, Work, and Industry. London: Routledge. . p. 392. Education The sociology of education is the study of how educational institutions determine social structures, experiences, and other outcomes. It is particularly concerned with the schooling systems of modern industrial societies. A classic 1966 study in this field by James Coleman, known as the \\"Coleman Report\\", analysed the performance of over 150,000 students and found that student background and socioeconomic status are much more important in determining educational outcomes than are measured differences in school resources (i.e. per pupil spending). The controversy over \\"school effects\\" ignited by that study has continued to this day. The study also found that socially disadvantaged black students profited from schooling in racially mixed classrooms, and thus served as a catalyst for desegregation busing in American public schools. Environment Environmental sociology is the study of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster. =Human ecology= Human ecology deals with interdisciplinary study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. In addition to Environmental sociology, this field overlaps with architectural sociology, urban sociology, and to some extent visual sociology. In turn, visual sociology—which is concerned with all visual dimensions of social life—overlaps with media studies in that it uses photography, film and other technologies of media. =Social pre-wiring= Social pre-wiring deals with the study of fetal social behavior and social interactions in a multi- fetal environment. Specifically, social pre-wiring refers to the ontogeny of social interaction. Also informally referred to as, \\"wired to be social.\\" The theory questions whether there is a propensity to socially oriented action already present before birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique genetic wiring to be social.Castiello, Umberto, Cristina Becchio, Stefania Zoia, Cristian Nelini, et al. 2010. \\"Wired to be Social: The Ontogeny of Human Interaction.\\" PLOS One 5(10). . . — via National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine. Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics. Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed. The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct: > The central advance of this study is the demonstration that 'social actions' > are already performed in the second trimester of gestation. Starting from > the 14th week of gestation twin foetuses plan and execute movements > specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the > emergence of social behavior: when the context enables it, as in the case of > twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant > over self-directed actions. Family, gender, and sexuality \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" was an iconic symbol of the American homefront and a departure from gender roles due to wartime necessity. Family, gender and sexuality form a broad area of inquiry studied in many sub-fields of sociology. A family is a group of people who are related by kinship ties :- Relations of blood / marriage / civil partnership or adoption. The family unit is one of the most important social institutions found in some form in nearly all known societies. It is the basic unit of social organization and plays a key role in socializing children into the culture of their society. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an institution and unit of socialization, with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the nuclear family and its distinct gender roles. The notion of \\"childhood\\" is also significant. As one of the more basic institutions to which one may apply sociological perspectives, the sociology of the family is a common component on introductory academic curricula. Feminist sociology, on the other hand, is a normative sub-field that observes and critiques the cultural categories of gender and sexuality, particularly with respect to power and inequality. The primary concern of feminist theory is the patriarchy and the systematic oppression of women apparent in many societies, both at the level of small- scale interaction and in terms of the broader social structure. Feminist sociology also analyses how gender interlocks with race and class to produce and perpetuate social inequalities. \\"How to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods\\" is also a concern. Health, illness, and the body The sociology of health and illness focuses on the social effects of, and public attitudes toward, illnesses, diseases, mental health and disabilities. This sub-field also overlaps with gerontology and the study of the ageing process. Medical sociology, by contrast, focuses on the inner- workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions. In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report (1944). The sociology of the body and embodiment takes a broad perspective on the idea of \\"the body\\" and includes \\"a wide range of embodied dynamics including human and non-human bodies, morphology, human reproduction, anatomy, body fluids, biotechnology, genetics. This often intersects with health and illness, but also theories of bodies as political, social, cultural, economic and ideological productions. The ISA maintains a Research Committee devoted to \\"the Body in the Social Sciences.\\" =Death, dying, bereavement= A subfield of the sociology of health and illness that overlaps with cultural sociology is the study of death, dying and bereavement, sometimes referred to broadly as the sociology of death. This topic is exemplified by the work of Douglas Davies and Michael C. Kearl. Knowledge and science The sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. The term first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking theorists, most notably Max Scheler, and Karl Mannheim, wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of functionalism through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann in The Social Construction of Reality (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare socially constructed reality). The \\"archaeological\\" and \\"genealogical\\" studies of Michel Foucault are of considerable contemporary influence. The sociology of science involves the study of science as a social activity, especially dealing \\"with the social conditions and effects of science, and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity.\\" Important theorists in the sociology of science include Robert K. Merton and Bruno Latour. These branches of sociology have contributed to the formation of science and technology studies. Both the ASA and the BSA have sections devoted to the subfield of Science, Knowledge and Technology. The ISA maintains a Research Committee on Science and Technology. Leisure Sociology of leisure is the study of how humans organize their free time. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as sport, tourism, and the playing of games. The sociology of leisure is closely tied to the sociology of work, as each explores a different side of the work–leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work–leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture. This area of sociology began with Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class. Peace, war, and conflict This subfield of sociology studies, broadly, the dynamics of war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions. As a subset of this subfield, military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group rather than as an organization. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial- academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military. Political sociology Jürgen Habermas Historically, political sociology concerned the relations between political organization and society. A typical research question in this area might be: \\"Why do so few American citizens choose to vote?\\"Piven, F. 1988. Why Americans Don't Vote: And Why Politicians Want it That Way Pantheon. In this respect questions of political opinion formation brought about some of the pioneering uses of statistical survey research by Paul Lazarsfeld. A major subfield of political sociology developed in relation to such questions, which draws on comparative history to analyse socio-political trends. The field developed from the work of Max Weber and Moisey Ostrogorsky.Lipset, Seymour Martin. 1982 [1964]. \\"Introduction: Ostrogorski and the Analytical Approach to the Comparative Study of Political Parties.\\" In Democracy and the Organisation of Political Parties 2, edited by S. M. Lipset. Contemporary political sociology includes these areas of research, but it has been opened up to wider questions of power and politics.Nash, Kate. 2009. . John Wiley & Sons. . Retrieved 4 November 2011. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions in such a way as to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power. Political sociology has also moved beyond methodological nationalism and analysed the role of non-governmental organizations, the diffusion of the nation-state throughout the Earth as a social construct, and the role of stateless entities in the modern world society. Contemporary political sociologists also study inter-state interactions and human rights. Population and demography Demographers or sociologists of population study the size, composition and change over time of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study of population is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and is closely related to human geography. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology. Public sociology Public sociology refers to an approach to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a style of sociology rather than a particular method, theory, or set of political values. This approach is primarily associated with Michael Burawoy who contrasted it with professional sociology, a form of academic sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists. Public sociology is also part of the broader field of science communication or science journalism. Race and ethnic relations The sociology of race and of ethnic relations is the area of the discipline that studies the social, political, and economic relations between races and ethnicities at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study of racism, residential segregation, and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology, as well as with postcolonial theory. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either assimilationism or multiculturalism.Louw, Milton. 22 February 2012. \\"Oldest Coloured Owned Business in Namibia.\\" . Anti-racism forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Religion The sociology of religion concerns the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society.Christiano, Kevin J., et al. 2008. Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments (2nd ed.). Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield. . There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that sociologists do not set out to assess the validity of religious truth-claims, instead assuming what Peter L. Berger has described as a position of \\"methodological atheism.\\"Berger, Peter L. 1990 [1967].The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion. Anchor Books. It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology began with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 study of suicide rates among Roman Catholic and Protestant populations. Max Weber published four major texts on religion in a context of economic sociology and social stratification: The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905), The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism (1915), The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism (1915), and Ancient Judaism (1920). Contemporary debates often centre on topics such as secularization, civil religion, the intersection of religion and economics and the role of religion in a context of globalization and multiculturalism. Social change and development The sociology of change and development attempts to understand how societies develop and how they can be changed. This includes studying many different aspects of society, for example demographic trends, political or technological trends, or changes in culture. Within this field, sociologists often use macrosociological methods or historical- comparative methods. In contemporary studies of social change, there are overlaps with international development or community development. However, most of the founders of sociology had theories of social change based on their study of history. For instance, Marx contended that the material circumstances of society ultimately caused the ideal or cultural aspects of society, while Weber argued that it was in fact the cultural mores of Protestantism that ushered in a transformation of material circumstances. In contrast to both, Durkheim argued that societies moved from simple to complex through a process of sociocultural evolution. Sociologists in this field also study processes of globalization and imperialism. Most notably, Immanuel Wallerstein extends Marx's theoretical frame to include large spans of time and the entire globe in what is known as world systems theory. Development sociology is also heavily influenced by post-colonialism. In recent years, Raewyn Connell issued a critique of the bias in sociological research towards countries in the Global North. She argues that this bias blinds sociologists to the lived experiences of the Global South, specifically, so-called, \\"Northern Theory\\" lacks an adequate theory of imperialism and colonialism. There are many organizations studying social change, including the Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems, and Civilizations, and the Global Social Change Research Project. Social networks Harrison White A social network is a social structure composed of individuals (or organizations) called \\"nodes\\", which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of interdependency, such as friendship, kinship, financial exchange, dislike, sexual relationships, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. An underlying theoretical assumption of social network analysis is that groups are not necessarily the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from non-local communities to networks of exchange. Drawing theoretically from relational sociology, social network analysis avoids treating individuals (persons, organizations, states) as discrete units of analysis, it focuses instead on how the structure of ties affects and constitutes individuals and their relationships. In contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behaviour, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms. On the other hand, recent research by Omar Lizardo also demonstrates that network ties are shaped and created by previously existing cultural tastes. Social network theory is usually defined in formal mathematics and may include integration of geographical data into Sociomapping. Social psychology Sociological social psychology focuses on micro-scale social actions. This area may be described as adhering to \\"sociological miniaturism\\", examining whole societies through the study of individual thoughts and emotions as well as behaviour of small groups. Of special concern to psychological sociologists is how to explain a variety of demographic, social, and cultural facts in terms of human social interaction. Some of the major topics in this field are social inequality, group dynamics, prejudice, aggression, social perception, group behaviour, social change, non-verbal behaviour, socialization, conformity, leadership, and social identity. Social psychology may be taught with psychological emphasis. In sociology, researchers in this field are the most prominent users of the experimental method (however, unlike their psychological counterparts, they also frequently employ other methodologies). Social psychology looks at social influences, as well as social perception and social interaction. Stratification, poverty and inequality Social stratification is the hierarchical arrangement of individuals into social classes, castes, and divisions within a society. Modern Western societies stratification traditionally relates to cultural and economic classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and lower class, but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. occupational). Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of structural functionalism suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. Conflict theorists, by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of social mobility in stratified societies. Karl Marx distinguished social classes by their connection to the means of production in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the means, but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power (forming the material base of the cultural superstructure). Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. patriarchy). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: # Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. # Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth. # Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power. Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle- class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies.Dahrendorf, Ralf. 1959. Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society. Stanford: Stanford University Press. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries.Bornschier V. 1996. Western Society in Transition. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers. Urban and rural sociology Urban sociology involves the analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. It is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making. After the industrial revolution, works such as Georg Simmel's The Metropolis and Mental Life (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The Chicago School produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilizing symbolic interactionism as a method of field research. Contemporary research is commonly placed in a context of globalization, for instance, in Saskia Sassen's study of the \\"Global city\\". Rural sociology, by contrast, is the analysis of non-metropolitan areas. As agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions, rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists. =Community sociology= Often grouped with urban and rural sociology is that of community sociology or the sociology of community. Taking various communities—including online communities—as the unit of analysis, community sociologists study the origin and effects of different associations of people. For instance, German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies distinguished between two types of human association: gemeinschaft (usually translated as \\"community\\") and gesellschaft (\\"society\\" or \\"association\\"). In his 1887 work, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Tönnies argued that Gemeinschaft is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a \\"unity of will.\\"Tönnies, Ferdinand. 1887. Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft. p. 22. The 'development' or 'health' of a community is also a central concern of community sociologists also engage in development sociology, exemplified by the literature surrounding the concept of social capital. Other academic disciplines Sociology overlaps with a variety of disciplines that study society, in particular anthropology, political science, economics, social work and social philosophy. Many comparatively new fields such as communication studies, cultural studies, demography and literary theory, draw upon methods that originated in sociology. The terms \\"social science\\" and \\"social research\\" have both gained a degree of autonomy since their origination in classical sociology. The distinct field of social anthropology or anthroposociology is the dominant constituent of anthropology throughout the United Kingdom and Commonwealth and much of Europe (France in particular),Dianteill, Erwan. 2012. \\"Cultural Anthropology or Social Anthropology? A Transatlantic Dispute.\\" L’Année sociologique 62(2012/1):93-122. where it is distinguished from cultural anthropology.QAA. 2007. Anthropology. Mansfield, UK: Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. Archived from the original 21 September 2013. . In the United States, social anthropology is commonly subsumed within cultural anthropology (or under the relatively new designation of sociocultural anthropology). Sociology and applied sociology are connected to the professional and academic discipline of social work. Both disciplines study social interactions, community and the effect of various systems (i.e. family, school, community, laws, political sphere) on the individual. However, social work is generally more focused on practical strategies to alleviate social dysfunctions; sociology in general provides a thorough examination of the root causes of these problems. For example, a sociologist might study why a community is plagued with poverty. The applied sociologist would be more focused on practical strategies on what needs to be done to alleviate this burden. The social worker would be focused on action; implementing theses strategies \\"directly\\" or \\"indirectly\\" by means of mental health therapy, counselling, advocacy, community organization or community mobilization. Social anthropology is the branch of anthropology that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in social groups. Practitioners of social anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets of social organization. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge. Sociocultural anthropology, which include linguistic anthropology, is concerned with the problem of difference and similarity within and between human populations. The discipline arose concomitantly with the expansion of European colonial empires, and its practices and theories have been questioned and reformulated along with processes of decolonization. Such issues have re-emerged as transnational processes have challenged the centrality of the nation-state to theorizations about culture and power. New challenges have emerged as public debates about multiculturalism, and the increasing use of the culture concept outside of the academy and among peoples studied by anthropology. These times are not \\"business-as-usual\\" in the academy, in anthropology, or in the world, if ever there were such times. Irving Louis Horowitz, in his The Decomposition of Sociology (1994), has argued that the discipline, while arriving from a \\"distinguished lineage and tradition,\\" is in decline due to deeply ideological theory and a lack of relevance to policy making: \\"The decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking, and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian triumphs.\\" Furthermore: \\"A problem yet unmentioned is that sociology's malaise has left all the social sciences vulnerable to pure positivism—to an empiricism lacking any theoretical basis. Talented individuals who might, in an earlier time, have gone into sociology are seeking intellectual stimulation in business, law, the natural sciences, and even creative writing; this drains sociology of much needed potential.\\" Horowitz cites the lack of a 'core discipline' as exacerbating the problem. Randall Collins, the Dorothy Swaine Thomas Professor in Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Advisory Editors Council of the Social Evolution & History journal, has voiced similar sentiments: \\"we have lost all coherence as a discipline, we are breaking up into a conglomerate of specialities, each going on its own way and with none too high regard for each other.\\"Collins, Randall as cited in Horowitz, Irving. 1994. The Decomposition of Sociology. Oxford University Press. pp. 3–9. In 2007, The Times Higher Education Guide published a list of 'The most cited authors of books in the Humanities' (including philosophy and psychology). Seven of the top ten are listed as sociologists: Michel Foucault (1), Pierre Bourdieu (2), Anthony Giddens (5), Erving Goffman (6), Jürgen Habermas (7), Max Weber (8), and Bruno Latour (10).  Journals  The most highly ranked general journals which publish original research in the field of sociology are the American Journal of Sociology and the American Sociological Review. The Annual Review of Sociology, which publishes original review essays, is also highly ranked. Many other generalist and specialized journals exist.

The Hackensack Water Company, a predecessor of Suez North America, developed water supply and storage in northeastern New Jersey from the 1870s to the 1970s, initially to provide service to the city of Hackensack and the towns of North Hudson. Originally its headquarters and major facilities were located at Hackensack, in Bergen County. Under Robert W. de Forest, who ran the Hackensack Water Company for 46 years beginning in 1881, the company constructed new facilities and moved its headquarters to Weehawken in Hudson County, setting up offices in a brick water tower,\\"United Water Resources, Inc. History\\". Funding Universe. Retrieved April 15, 2014. part of the present complex. Weehawken Water Tower The headquarters' most distinguishing feature, the red brick Weehawken Water Tower, was built in 1883 on what is now Park Avenue, on the border of Union City. Designed by Frederick Clarke Withers, it was modeled after the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Italy. The tower stands 175 feet high, 300 feet above sea level at the Hudson River.Anderson, Steph (September 17, 2005). \\"What's that building??\\" . The Jersey City Reporter. Accessed August 4, 2008.Fitzgerald, Vincent J. (October 12, 2014). \\"Historic structure comes alive!\\" The Union City Reporter. pp. 1 and 7. The tower was connected to Reservoir No.1 atop the Hudson Palisades to which water was pumped from the Hackensack River, about 14 miles away. While the reservoir at the site could provide adequate pressure for water users in Hoboken, located just above sea level, water pressure was inadequate for customers atop the Palisades.Weehawken Water Tower , Rogersheperd.com. Accessed August 4, 2008. The tower was designed to accomplish two purposes. First, it housed the local headquarters of the Hackensack Water Company; second, it held up to 165,000 gallons of potable water in its tank, stored under pressure for use by residents, businesses, and for fighting fires. Its opening on September 29, 1883 was a major event, professional journals recognized Withers for the innovation of his design. The \\"Red Tower\\" is listed on the Federal Maritime Chart as a landmark for ships heading south on the Hudson River to let them know that they are approaching New York Harbor. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980,New Jersey - Hudson County, National Register of Historic Places. Accessed August 4, 2008. which spared it from demolition, after which it was structurally maintained. Entin Associates, a real-estate developer, purchased the complex in 1981 for $1.6 million. The gatehouse and reservoir were razed for the construction of a supermarket and parking. The tower was spared demolition and structurally maintained. The township of Weehawken took over the property in 2000, and began a restoration project for Water Tower Park. Paragon Restoration Corporation completed eight months of restoration on the site's exteriors in September 2004, with slate replaced on the roof, stonework fixed at the base and windows replaced. New steel supports and wood floors were installed in the interior, and space was left to accommodate an elevator and fire staircase. In October 2005, a plaza park was created at the base of the tower. The interior of the tower was restored in the late 2000s. In 2010, as part of the town's 150th anniversary, interior brickwork was cleaned while maintaining its historical appearance. In 2014, Mayor Richard Turner opened up the Water Tower for the annual three-week-long PlayWorks reading series, in which playwrights present readings of their unfinished plays, which celebrated the first time the restored tower had been used in over 100 years.Hoersch, Joanne (March 30, 2014). \\"'Cuckoo's Nest' in our future\\". The Union City Reporter. pp. 3-5. In September 2014, Justin Casquejo, a thrill-seeking teenage free solo climber and stunt performer hung from the tower, and was charged with defiant trespassing and resisting arrest. Hackensack Reservoir No. 2-Reservoir Park Historical marker at Palisade and Highpoint View from Palisade Avenue Hackensack Reservoir No. 2 was another component of the water company's system in the township, later owned by its successor, United Water. The site, slightly more than 14 acres and the largest piece of undeveloped property in North Hudson, is located in Weehawken Heights and is bounded by Highpoint Avenue, Gregory Avenue, 20th Street, and Palisade Avenue, the latter two of which create the border with neighboring Union City. It was built during a period of extensive urbanization of the area in the late 19th century. The historical marker reads: United Water announced that it wanted to divest most of the property in early 2011 at an unofficial price of $11.5 million. The company will retain 4.2 acres to build an underground water storage tank to improve water pressure, estimated to cost $25 to $30 million. The Trust for Public Land, which appraised the site, arranged to postpone the sale of the reservoir until the end of the year.\\"Land and Reservoir Acquired for New Weehawken Public Park\\". The Trust for Public Land. December 28, 2011 In 2010 the township began a process to purchase the grounds. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection gave the township a $2 million grant in Green Acres funding. A $9 million low interest loan from the department's infrastructure trust program was made with the intention that in the future, as funding permits, additional grants for re-payment would be made. No interest has to be paid on three-quarters of the money and minimal interest on the other one-quarter. The township introduced a bond for $9.2 million. Weehawken and Union City are initially investing $300,000 to transform the grounds into passive recreational space. They will share the annual upkeep of the property.Pope, Gennarose (November 13, 2011). \\"Preserving open space: Union-City and Weehawken to buy reservoir\\". The Hudson Reporter.

He is also friendly with the baron's Swordmaster, Owen Greylock, who is impressed with Erik's skill with horses. Every time the Baron Von Darkmoor comes through Ravensburg, Erik's mother Freida would publicly press the Baron to acknowledge Erik as his son. While never admitting it, the Baron has also never refuted it, therefore Erik could continue to use the Von Darkmoor name. Erik was the strongest boy in his village and was large for his age. During one of the Baron's trips, he falls ill and has to stop in Ravensburg with his two sons, Stefan and Manfred. *Ashen-Shugar and Tomas are two of the main characters from the Riftwar Cycle series of books. According to the books, Tomas, a human teenager from the city of Crydee, was gifted a set of gold and white armour. The armor once belonged to Ashen-Shugar, who was a Valheru that was born ages before Tomas. The Valheru, modeled after J. R. R. Tolkien's Valar by Feist, were godly beings that were some of the first to inhabit the universe created by Feist. Ashen-Shugar's powers, memories, and personality were bound to the armor when he faded away. By donning the mystical armor, an amalgam of Tomas and Ashen-Shugar was made, essentially creating a new character.

Activities In entrepreneurship, the Foundation focuses on strengthening organizations and programs that allow entrepreneurs to develop knowledge and skills, start a new business, or grow an existing one; and strengthening communities to have more supportive environments for entrepreneurs, including policies, practices, and programs. This is done by connecting entrepreneurs and advocates to policymakers so they can educate them about why entrepreneurship matters and how to support it; championing a community-focused model of economic development, focused on the entrepreneur, with the help of ecosystem builders; providing opportunities for aspiring and early-stage entrepreneurs to learn how to start and grow their businesses; building more access to capital for entrepreneurs who have been historically left behind, including due to their race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic class, and/or geographic location; creating knowledge and actionable guidance for decision-makers that improves policies, practices, and programs; and helping entrepreneur support organizations in the Heartland region build capacity and pilot programs that serve entrepreneurs. The Foundation's major entrepreneurship education programs include Kauffman FastTrac, which equips aspiring entrepreneurs with the business skills and insights, tools, resources, and peer networks necessary to start and grow successful businesses; 1 Million Cups, a free program designed to educate, engage, and inspire entrepreneurs around the country; Kauffman Entrepreneurs, a resources site for developing ideas; and Global Entrepreneurship Week, a series of events every November designed to encourage entrepreneurship. In education, the Foundation supports students of all ages to find and define their path, starting with early childhood education and going all the way to career readiness. This is done by investing in people and organizations to increase access to quality early childhood education; supporting students, focusing on their outcomes from kindergarten through high school to ensure opportunity and success are equitable, unpredictable by race or background; changing what it means to graduate from high school, prepared for what happens next and providing all students with the opportunity to earn college degrees or other credentials; setting a new standard for workforce credentialing through innovative non-degree pathways and an embedded entrepreneurial curriculum; bringing communities of educators together to ensure talent pipelines and development programs are racially diverse, robust, and relevant today and in the future; and collaborating with and learning from communities of all kinds to identify challenges, understand approaches, and catalyze efforts to ensure learning and education are pathways to individual economic empowerment and regional growth. In 2011, the Kauffman Foundation opened the Ewing Marion Kauffman School, a college preparatory public charter school in the Kansas City Public Schools district. Kauffman Scholars, Inc., founded in 2003, is another educational program supported by the Kauffman Foundation. Kauffman Scholars, Inc. is a multi-year college access and scholarship program intended to help low-income urban students in Kansas City. The Foundation's work in Kansas City complements the work in education and entrepreneurship while also contributing to the vibrancy of Kansas City. This is done by helping students living in historically disinvested zip codes achieve success through investments outside of school, such as afterschool, STEM programming, and targeted programs to stimulate supportive learning environments for youth; helping established, nationally recognized cultural assets build organizational and financial capacity; helping emerging, regionally recognized cultural assets to increase their capacity to scale and sustain programming; and supporting communities as they work to solve entrenched local issues that create disparate outcomes.

Located on Mount Shekhanya in the Lower Galilee, about 30 km northeast of Haifa and at an average elevation is 382 meters above sea level, it falls under the jurisdiction of Misgav Regional Council. In it had a population of . History The village was established by a group of immigrants from South Africa in 1980 on the land of the depopulated Palestinian village of Mi'ar. Town facilities As of 2015, Manof includes 175 single-family detached homes. Additional town facilities include a grocery store, preschools for children aged 1–6 (up to kindergarten), a playground, ball courts (for soccer, tennis and basketball), a synagogue, a small library, and a small petting zoo. Beyond kindergarten, there are no schools inside Manof. Most Manof children go, via school bus, to the Har Shekhanya elementary school in the adjacent town of Shekhanya (for grades 1-6), and then for grades 7-12 go to the Misgav highschool in the nearby (10-minute drive) Misgav regional council center. The council center houses various other facilities, such as healthcare, a gym and pool, a library, after-school activities for children, and more. There are only a few small places of business in Manof's industrial zone, including a small chocolate factory, a plant nursery, an art therapy studio and a sport shop. A few other residents have a home business, or work from home. But the majority of the Manof residents work outside Manof, often nearby cities such as Haifa or Karmiel. As such, Manof is often considered a commuter town. Politics In the 2009 elections, 317 people voted in Manof. 44% of the votes went to Kadima, 26% went to the Israeli Labor Party, 10% to each of Meretz and Likud, 5% to the Green Movement and 2% or less to other parties. In the 2013 elections, 361 people voted in Manof. 29% of the votes went to the Israeli Labor Party, 29% went to Yesh Atid, 19% to Meretz, 10% to Hatnuah, 6% to Likud and 2% or less to other parties. In the 2015 elections, 416 people voted in Manof (out of the 555 eligible). 59% of the votes went to the Israeli Labor Party, 18% went to Yesh Atid, 14% to Meretz, 3% to Kulanu, 3% to Likud and 2% or less to other parties. Fun Run The Manof Fun Run is an annual tradition kept in Manof since 1980. The Fun Run is an amateur running event, going uphill along the road into Manof. The video linked below which shows life in Manof in 1980 centers around that year's Manof Fun Run. The Fun Run started as a local Manof event, but in recent years has become popular with residents of other towns in the Misgav area, and is now formally named the Misgav Race. The race is actually several races of different lengths (2.5 km to 10 km), and a 2 km non-competitive family run. All races end in the center of Manof, where runners and their families can find food stands, art activities, and other attractions.

The utility reads input files character by character (sequentially), applying the operation which has been specified via the command line or a pep script, and then outputs the line. It was developed from 2006 in the C language. Pep has derived a number of ideas and syntax elements from Sed, a command line text stream editor.  Features  The pattern-parser language uses many ideas taken from sed, the Unix stream editor. For example, sed includes two virtual variables or data buffers, known as the \\"pattern space\\" and the \\"hold space\\". These two variables constitute an extremely simple virtual machine. In the pep language this virtual machine has been augmented with several new buffers or registers along with a number of commands to manipulate these buffers. The parsing virtual machine includes a tape data structure as well as a stack (data structure), along with a \\"workspace\\" (which is the equivalent of the sed \\"pattern space\\" and a number of other buffers of lesser importance. This virtual machine is designed specifically to be apt for the parsing of formal languages. This parsing process traditionally involves two phases; the lexical analysis phase and the formal grammar phase. During the lexical analysis phase as series of tokens are generated. These tokens are then used as the input for a set of formal grammar rule. The chomski virtual machine uses the stack to hold these tokens and uses the tape structure to hold the attributes of these parse tokens. In a pep script, these two phases, lexing and parsing, are combined in one script file. A series of command words are used to manipulate the different data structures of the virtual machine. Purpose and motivation The purpose of the pep tool is to parse and transform text patterns. The text patterns conform to the rules provided in a formal language and include many context free languages. Whereas traditional Unix tools (such as awk, sed, grep, etc.) process text one line at a time, and use regular expressions to search or transform text, the pep tool processes text one character at a time and can use context free grammars to transform (or compile) the text. However, in common with the Unix philosophy, the pep tool works upon plain text streams, encoded according to the locale of the local computer, and produces as output another plain text stream, allowing the pep tool to be used as part of a standard pipeline. The motivation for the creation of the pp tool and the virtual machine was to allow the writing of parsing scripts, rather than having to resort to traditional parsing tools such as Lex and Yacc or their many variants and improvements such as Antlr. Usage The following example shows a typical use of pep pattern parser, where the -e option indicates that the pattern parse expression follows: $ pep -e 'read; \\"/\\"{ read; \\"*\\"{ until \\"*/\\"; clear; }} print; clear;' input.c > output.c In the above script, C multiline comments () are deleted from the input stream. The pattern parser tool was designed to be used as a filter in a pipeline: for example, $ generate.data  pep -e '\\"x\\"{clear;add \\"y\\";}print;clear;' That is, generate the data, and then make the small change of replacing x with y. However this functionality is not currently available because the pep tool also includes a comprehensive script viewer and debugger and so cannot read from piped standard input. Several commands can be put together in a file called, for example, substitute.pss and then be applied using the option to read the commands from the file: $ pep -f substitute.pss file > output Besides substitution, other forms of simple processing are possible. For example, the following uses the accumulator-increment command and commands to count the number of lines in a file: $ pep -e '\\" \\" { a+;} clear; (eof) {count;print;}' textile Complex \\"pep\\" constructs are possible, allowing it to serve as a simple, but highly specialised, programming language. pep has two flow control statements (apart from the test structures \`(eof)\`, \`[class]\`, \`\` etc.), namely the and commands, which jump back to the label (no other labels are permitted). History The idea for the pep machine and language arose from the limitations of regular expression engines and sed which uses a line by line paradigm, and the limitations on parsing nested text patterns with regular expressions. Pep evolved as a natural progression from the grep and sed command. Development began approximately in 2006 and continues.Developer’s (M.J. Bishop) personal recollection Limitations The pattern parsing script language is not a general purpose programming language. Like sed it is designed for a limited type of usage. The interpret and executable does not currently support unicode strings, since the implementation uses standard C character arrays. However scripts can also be translated into other languages (such as java and javascript) which do support unicode text. Since the virtual machine behind the pattern parser language is considerably more complex than that of sed it is necessary to be able to debug scripts. This facility is currently provided within the 'pep' executable.

A regular soldier between 1936 and 1954, he was made MBE for his services to the Royal Armoured Corps during the Second World War. His love of tanks was reflected in The Boilerplate War, a book of recollections of the early days of armoured warfare, and Mailed Fist, telling of his tank exploits in Normandy in 1944. He drew on his military experience in several other successful novels, including Death of a Regiment and Bull and Brass. He spent five years as a military reporter and later served in the Directorate of Public Relations at the War Office. On retiring from the Army, he continued in public relations, and became prominent as a consultant, being particularly concerned with the problems of American-owned businesses in Britain. He was also a director of Campbell-Johnson Ltd. A man of wide interests, he was also known as a broadcaster and scriptwriter, and was military advisor to the popular ITV comedy show, The Army Game. He is also the author of two screenplay novelisations, published in paperback as media tie-ins, which some sources erroneously list as original novels upon which the films were based, although each book cover states that it is \\"the book of the film\\", and cites its screenplay origins and authors. *Man in the Moon, (1960) (film starring Kenneth More and Shirley Anne Field), based on the screenplay by Bryan Forbes and Michael Relph (Four Square Books), which is credited on the back cover AbeBooks: Man in the Moon, Foley, John (based on the screenplay by Bryan Forbes and Michael Relph) Retrieved 2012-09-08 *Very Important Person (1961), (film starring James Robertson Justice and Leslie Phillips), based on the screenplay by Jack Davies and Henry Blyth (Mayfair Books), which is cited on the back cover, the title page and (by implication in) a joint copyright shared by John Foley and Jack DaviesAmazon UK: Very Important Person.

Gerard Chapel, Church of St John the Baptist, Ashley, Staffordshire Sir Gilbert Gerard (died 4 February 1593) was a prominent lawyer, politician, and landowner of the Tudor period. He was returned six times as a member of the English parliament for four different constituencies. He was Attorney-General for more than twenty years during the reign of Elizabeth I, as well as vice-chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and later served as Master of the Rolls. He acquired large estates, mainly in Lancashire and Staffordshire. Background Gerard was born by 1523.History of Parliament Online: Members 1509–1558 - GERARD, Gilbert (by 1523–93) - Author: R. J.W. Swales He was the son of James Gerard of Astley and Ince, Lancashire, who was descended from the Gerards of Bryn, Ashton in Makerfield, Lancashire, and Kingsley, Cheshire. The Gerard family had lived at Ince, near Wigan, since the late 14th century.Victoria County History: Lancashire, Volume 4, Chapter 22 - Ince, s.2 - Manor This source also has a line drawing of the Gerard arms. However, James was probably a younger son, so it was not expected that he or Gilbert would inherit the family estates. The Gerard family became wealthy and distinguished in the reign of Elizabeth I, although Sir Gilbert was the most successful of them. Owing to repeated use of the same names in the Gerard family, Sir Gilbert's relatives are easily confused. Sir Gilbert was a cousin of the distinguished judge and administrator Sir William Gerard, who ended his career as Lord Chancellor of Ireland.History of Parliament Online: Members 1558–1603 - GERARD, William I (d.1581) - Author: N.

Gilbert's mother was Margaret Holcroft, daughter of John Holcroft of Holcroft, Lancashire. The Holcrofts were another rising landed gentry family. Margaret had two brothers: Sir John Holcroft and Sir Thomas Holcroft. Both distinguished themselves in the Anglo-Scottish Wars, served as MP for Lancashire, and profited from speculation in monastic lands at the Dissolution of the Monasteries, although it was Sir Thomas, the younger brother, who had the more successful and varied career, building up a substantial estate around the estates of the former Vale Royal Abbey.History of Parliament Online: Members 1509–1558 - HOLCROFT, Sir Thomas (1505/6-58) - Author: R. J.W. Swales Sir John, heir to the family estates, speculated in wardships,History of Parliament Online: Members 1509–1558 - HOLCROFT, Sir John (by 1498–1560) - Author: Alan Davidson and it was through one of these that Gilbert Gerard's marriage was arranged, to Anne Radcliffe or Ratcliffe. Sir John addressed Gerard as \\"cousin\\", a term also used for their relationship by the History of Parliament. \\"Cousin\\" was used in the 16th century more widely for blood relatives than in modern English: Sir John and Sir Thomas were Gerard's uncles. Education Gerard spent some time at the University of Cambridge but did not graduate, as was typical at the time. He entered Gray's Inn in 1537, when he was probably still about 16, and was called to the bar in 1539. He seems to have been an outstanding student and was honoured by the Inn several times in later life. In 1554 he was elected Autumn Reader, an important post with both academic and administrative responsibilities, and in 1556 he served as Treasurer. Allegiance to Gray's Inn became a family tradition and it served as a power base for the family. Gerard installed himself in a room there and was generally styled \\"of Gray's Inn\\". His nephew William later moved into the room too and added an office above it for his own use, and Thomas Holcroft, Sir Thomas's son, was also admitted to Gray's Inn in 1588.History of Parliament Online: Members 1558–1609 - HOLCROFT, Thomas II (1557–1620) - Author: Patricia Hyde Parliamentary career Gerard's parliamentary career was interwoven with his progress as a lawyer. He was returned to parliament a total of six times, four of them in the reign of Mary. The 3rd Earl of Derby, a key early patron of Gerard. Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel, another of Gerard's political patrons. Gerard was first returned as MP in 1545 for Liverpool. The town belonged to the Duchy of Lancaster, and the most important local magnates were the Earls of Derby and the Molyneux family. 1545 may have been the first year Liverpool had returned members for about a century - certainly the first for which records survive. By the early years of Elizabeth's reign, the Earls of Derby and the Duchy of Lancashire were effectively selecting one member each, although it was the mayor and burgesses or freemen who nominally elected the members. Even in 1545, it is likely that Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby was a decisive influence in handing a seat to Gerard. The two probably already knew each other: Gerard was the earl's legal counsel by 1562 - perhaps much earlier. Another influential supporter would have been Gerard's uncle, Sir Thomas Holcroft, who was an official of the Duchy of Lancaster and held the Liverpool fee-farm of the Duchy: he was returned as MP for Lancashire in the same parliament. Gerard was returned as junior to the other member, Nicholas Cutler, a client of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. The influence of the Molyneux family grew subsequently and Sir William Molyneux and his son acquired joint control of the Liverpool fee-farm later in 1545, often coming into confrontation with Derby and the civic officials. This may have played a part in Gerard's move to a safer seat in later elections. Gerard was elected as MP for Wigan in March and October 1553: the last parliament of Edward VI and the first of Mary's reign. The lord of the manor of Wigan was the rector, and members of the Gerard family had purchased the advowson, making them extremely influential in local government, which was divided between the rector and the civic officials of the borough. As Wigan was part of the Duchy and the County palatine of Lancaster, duchy officials had considerable influence. The Earl of Derby was also an important figure locally. The senior MP in 1547 and for the next five elections was Alexander Barlow, a member of the Earl's council and soon to be his brother-in-law. All this favoured Gerard, although it is likely his own relatives were his most decisive allies: the High Sheriff of Lancashire, the returning officer, in 1553 was Sir Thomas Gerard, a cousin. In April 1554 Gerard was returned as MP for Steyning, Sussex. Steyning had belonged to Syon Abbey until the Dissolution of the monasteries but now formed part of the royal honour of Petworth. As steward of the honour, the decisive voice in selecting the members belonged to Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel, a religious conservative who had supported the Somerset faction under Edward VI and was now a key supporter of Queen Mary and Lord Steward of her household. Significantly, he was happy to support Gerard. Sir Thomas Holcroft, Gerard's uncle was returned for the neighbouring constituency of Arundel, where almost all the members in the 16th century were nominated by the earls. However, for the 1555 election Gerard returned to Wigan, again being returned as junior to Barlow. Gerard seems to have done little as a member of parliament. His name does not appear in the records, even though, as a rising lawyer, he would have been useful in drafting and reviewing bills. It is clear, however, that he broadly supported Mary's regime. If he had not, his name would appear on either the list of those who \\"stood for the true religion\\" in 1553-4,History of Parliament Online: Surveys 1509–1558 - Appendix XI - Author: S.T. Bindoff or among those who supported Sir Anthony Kingston in the 1555 parliament, or on the list of government opponents kept by William More.History of Parliament Online: Surveys 1509–1558 - Appendix XIII - Author: S.T. Bindoff Despite his reputation as a staunch Protestant supporter of Elizabeth, Gerard appears in fact to have been essentially conservative, accepting the existing regime irrespective of religious policy. Elizabeth probably promoted him because of his proven competence as an advocate, not his ideological purity. Only once more did Gerard secure election to parliament, and that much later in life. On 18 November 1584 he was returned as member for Lancashire. As the county seats were dominated by the Duchy of Lancaster and the Earls of Derby, Gerard would have had a good chance in Lancashire at any time. However, he was by now vice- chancellor of the Duchy, so the result was not in question. He was returned as senior knight of the shire, together with Richard Molyneux. As he was already Master of the Rolls, he was required to attend the House of Lords, although not a peer. Consequently, he was unable to sit in the House of Commons. In January of the following year he was replaced as MP by Richard Bold, a powerful local landowner whose wife was a known recusant and who had recently been reported to Burghley as a recusant himself.History of Parliament Online: Members 1558–1603 - BOLD, Richard (d.1602) - Author: N.M.S. Legal career=Barrister Information about Gerard's career before the accession of Elizabeth I is scanty and not always reliable. He was made an Ancient \\\\- a barrister qualified to practise independently - in 1547. The first mention of him as an advocate is in Edmund Plowden's Commentaries, relating to Michaelmas term 1554. According to a tradition found in William Dugdale's Baronage of England, Gerard represented Elizabeth when she was examined by the Privy Council: :\\"In the time of Queen Mary (as by credible tradition I have heard) upon the Lady Elizabeth's being questioned at the Council table, he was permitted to plead there on her behalf and performed his part so well that he suffered for the same in the Tower of London during the remaining term of Queen Mary's reign.\\" However, this is certainly not entirely true. Gerard cannot have spent much, if any time in prison, as he was appointed permanent counsel by the City of London in October 1554, and represented Wigan in the English parliament for the third time in 1555. Nor can he have incurred the wrath of Mary, as he was made a Serjeant-at-law, one of a small and extremely powerful group of barristers with exclusive rights to work in the Court of Common Pleas towards the end of her reign - an appointment that lapsed on her death. He was made Justice of the Peace in five counties by 1559, many of them probably in Mary's reign: Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire and Huntingdonshire. However, it is certainly true that Gerard was much favoured by Elizabeth and one of a small group of lawyers who were quickly installed in important offices to consolidate the new regime. Attorney-General Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury 1559–75. Thomas Bromley, Solicitor General 1569–79, Lord Chancellor 1579–87. Gerard was made Attorney-General on 22 January 1559, a week after Elizabeth's coronation, still a young man for such a senior legal post. He was early deputed to Ireland, where he helped reform the procedure of the Court of Exchequer and drew up new rules for collecting the Queen's rent. He sat as a judge on trials including that of John Hales in 1564. Much of his work was ecclesiastical and he was appointed to the Ecclesiastical Commission by 1564. In 1567 he helped Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in reforming Merton College, Oxford. From 1561 he represented the University of Cambridge whenever he was not engaged as a justice, and in 1571 he was thanked by the University for his work in securing the passage of an Act of Parliament confirming its charters and privileges. Gerard was appointed to key positions in the administration or judiciary all over the country. He was made Justice of the Peace in Norfolk and Suffolk, and later in Lancashire. In 1573 he was appointed Custos Rotulorum of Middlesex, the county's senior administrative official. Gerard was actively involved in defending Elizabeth against plots and revolts. In 1570, he was a member of a commission trying participants in the Rising of the North of the previous year, sitting mainly at York and Durham. In 1571 he assisted in the interrogation and prosecution of participants in the Ridolfi plot. He devised the questions put to the Duke of Norfolk, John Lesley, the Earl of Northumberland, Lord Lumley and others. In the following year he seconded Nicholas Barham in the prosecutions of Norfolk and his secretary, Robert Higford: the only two State Trials of his term of office. With Thomas Bromley, the Solicitor General from 1569, Gerard had to settle many problems of jurisdiction. One of the most important concerned an attempt in 1576 by Worcester and Worcestershire to shake off the authority of the Council of Wales and the Marches - a bid which Gerard and Bromley turned down. Gerard must have been disappointed that it was Bromley, about a decade younger than himself, who was appointed Lord Chancellor and Lord Keeper of the Great Seal in 1579, although he was rewarded with a knighthood in that year. However, the post of Attorney General was lucrative. It allowed Gerard to acquire wardships, leases and a grant of wine free of duty, and he exercised considerable patronage. Most importantly, it gave him access to a source of wealth and power through the Duchy of Lancaster, which dominated the north- west of England and had been united with the Crown since 1399. The duchy had considerable holdings outside its natural area of influence, and Gerard began by acquiring in 1567 the stewardship of Copt Hall in the honour of Clare, Suffolk, which had been transferred to the duchy by Queen Mary. In the same year he became steward of Rochdale manor, and over the decades increased his stewardships in Clare and became bailiff of the Lancashire hundreds of West Derby and Amounderness. In 1571 he became vice-chancellor of the duchy. Along with the Chancellor, Ralph Sadler, this gave him great political influence. Gerard and Sadler both used their positions to have their sons returned as MPs for Lancaster. Master of the Rolls Gerard was promoted in 1581 to be Master of the Rolls, the chief administrative post in the Court of Chancery and second most senior judge in the land. If the honour was not so great as the Chancellorship, the financial rewards were a great compensation. For example, in 1586 Gerard drew an income of £1,599 5s.3d. from his post, mainly from fines, writs and legal instruments. The posts of the clerks of the petty bag, the examiners and the clerks of the rolls chapel, usher, crier and doorkeeper, his three secretaries and numerous minor posts all fell within his patronage, so he was able to make considerable extra profits from the sale of offices. As Master of the Rolls, Gerard was still frequently involved in trials. He sat in the case of William Davison, who was the scapegoat for the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. Davison was standing in for Francis Walsingham as principal secretary to Elizabeth when the warrant for Mary's execution was signed. Elizabeth then decided to have Mary murdered secretly, but while she was wavering, Davison was present at a Privy Council meeting in Burghley's rooms when it was decided to send the warrant to Fotheringhay Castle.History of Parliament Online: Members 1558–1603 - DAVISON, William (c.1541–1608) - Author: N.M.S. Subsequently, Davison alone had to face Elizabeth's wrath. He was sent to the Star Chamber for trial, where Gerard and his fellow judges sentenced him to a fine of 10,000 marks and imprisonment during the Queen's pleasure. In fact, his fine was remitted and he was released after a few months, even receiving his salary while detained. However, the case is regarded as notorious by legal historians and did not reflect well on the judges involved. While a distinguished judge, Gerard seems to have been a poor administrator. His departments became increasingly chaotic and slipshod in their work. Bromley died in 1587 and was succeeded by the still younger Christopher Hatton, who survived only until 1591. At this point the Queen and her advisors decided to reorganise the legal departments. The issue of instruments was separated off and placed under the authority of a commission of Privy Councillors. Gerard and the other judges were formed into a second commission to hear cases. The commissions then began to dispute the boundaries of their jurisdiction, while Gerard's commission fell into internal dissension, with other judges refusing to accept his authority. The problems were compounded by his descent into illness, which led to his death on 4 February 1593. Landowner Although not heir to any of the major groups of Gerard family estates, Sir Gilbert was able to build up a large patrimony of his own. He did this mainly by seizing opportunities that came his way through his professional life or family contacts. Through his wife he acquired the Damhouse at Astley. He also had estates in Middlesex, Shropshire and Wiltshire. Another major purchase was within the family. His cousin, Sir Thomas Gerard of Bryn, was a Catholic and father of the famous Jesuit priest John Gerard. He acquired considerable estates in Derbyshire and Staffordshire, including Etwall through marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of John Port (the younger).History of Parliament Online: Members 1558–1603 - GERARD, Sir Thomas (d.1601) - Author: N. M. Fuidge He was implicated in a plot to free Mary, Queen of Scots, from Tutbury Castle, close to Etwall. Imprisonment and fines forced him to dispose of some property and he sold to Gilbert Gerard lands around Ashley, Staffordshire. Gilbert built there a very large house, Gerrard's Bromley, which became the seat of his branch of the Gerards. Marriage and family Gerard married Ann Radcliffe or Ratcliffe. She was the daughter of Thomas Ratcliffe of Winmarleigh and of Isabel Boteler. As her father died before she reached the age of majority, she became a ward of Sir Thomas Holcroft, Gerard's uncle. She inherited Damhouse in Astley, which was later sold by her son, Thomas. She remained a Catholic throughout her life. They had two sons: :* Thomas, Gilbert's heir, was created the first Baron Gerard of Gerrard's Bromley in 1603. :* Ratcliffe married Elizabeth Somerset, a wealthy heiress related to the Earls of Worcester. They had a number of children. ::*Sir Charles Gerard of Halsall, married Penelope, sister and coheir of Sir Edward Fitton, 2nd and last of the Fitton baronets of Gawsworth, Cheshire. They had at least three sons: :::*Charles (the eldest), a Cavalier general during the Civil War and a courtier after the Restoration. He was made Baron Gerard of Brandon in 1645 and Earl of Macclesfield in 1679. :::*Edward Gerard, a colonel of foot who was wounded at the First Battle of Newbury (1643). :::*Sir Gilbert Gerard, killed in one of the frequent skirmishes that took place in Ludlow between Cavaliers and Roundheads. ::*Gilbert, a colonel of a Royalist regiment of foot and was appointed Governor of Worcester in December 1642. ::* Ratcliffe, twin brother of Gilbert, under whom he served as a lieutenant-colonel. He married Jennet, the illegitimate daughter of Devereux Barrett of Tenby, Pembrokeshire. They had several children: :::* Gilbert (died 1687), served as a Royalist captain in the Civil War, after the restoration sat as MP for Northallerton and was made Baronet of Fiskerton :::* John (1632–1654) served as an ensign in the Civil War, was executed in for his part in the Gerard's conspiracy :::* Charles (born 1635) They also had at least four daughters who survived infancy: :* Frances married Richard Molyneux of Croxteth and Sefton, an important Lancashire landowner, who became first of the Molyneux baronets. One of their sons was ::* Richard Molyneux, 1st Viscount Molyneux :* Radclyffe married Sir Thomas Wingfield of Letheringham. :* Catherine married Richard Hoghton, a Lancashire landowner who became first of the De Hoghton baronets. :* Margaret married Peter Legh of Lyme Park, Cheshire, a client of the Earls of Derby who studied at Gray's Inn, probably under the auspices of Gilbert Gerard.History of Parliament Online: Members 1558–1603 - LEGH, Peter or Piers (c.1563–1636) - Author: N.M.S. Death and burial Gerard's will was made on 8 January 1593 and probate was on 6 April of that year. He died on 4 February 1593, and was buried at Ashley, Staffordshire, on 6 March. The legal historian Edward Foss points out that William Dugdale reported the year of his death as 1592, and this has been repeated in some accounts. In February 1592 (New Style) Gerard was still working, and around that time was put in charge of the new commission to hear cases in Chancery. The confusion was probably the result of the difference between Old Style and New Style dates. The known details are unusually exact, as the parish register recorded the date of death, not just the burial, as was customary. In his later years, Gerard had come under suspicion for his religious beliefs. An anonymous letter of 1586 to Walsingham denounced him as \\"a protestant at London and a papist in Lancashire ... there is no man that so much shifteth papists from the danger of the law as he doth\\". His wife and two of his daughters, at least, were known Catholics. Many of his descendants, like Richard Gerard of Hilderstone who died in Newgate Prison in 1680, were staunchly Catholic. However, this seems not to be true of his heir, Thomas, who gave specific directions to be buried without ceremony - a provision typical of radical Protestants. In the preamble to his will, Gerard himself expressed his trust in Divine grace, as \\"there is nothing in any of my works or deeds whereby I can or may challenge or attain unto everlasting life\\". These words closely echo the Protestant teaching embodied in Article 11 of the Thirty-Nine Articles: \\"We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by faith, and not for our own works or deservings.\\" He left plate to his sons-in-law Sir Richard Molyneux, Peter Legh and Richard Hoghton, and to an unmarried daughter, presumably Radclyffe, who was also promised £1,000 towards her wedding. His wife received all her jewels and household equipment, as well as use of his Middlesex house.

Gerard was commemorated by an elaborate memorial in Ashley parish church, which grew and was modified over several generations. The main structure, built under the supervision of Gilbert's son, Thomas, portrays him and Anne, lying in splendour. She has her Talbot dog at her side, while he is in full armour, an uncharacteristic garb for him, with a finely modelled gauntlet at his side. Beneath the Gerards is a cadaver, but, unlike the case of a normal cadaver tomb, it appears to date from an earlier period. The kneeling figure of Thomas Gerard looms over his parents at the head end, vigilant but not in prayer. A smaller kneeling and praying figure, said to be the younger son Ratcliffe, is placed at the feet of the couple. Both kneeling figures are completely free-standing and detached from the main structure, clearly added later and at the sacrifice of part of its moulded edge. The four daughters of Gilbert and Anne, all of whom survived their parents, are portrayed on a separate rear panel. Two more smaller kneeling and praying female figures, free-standing and detached, are placed to the front of the main structure - possibly daughters who predeceased their parents, but more likely of a later generation. The monument is surmounted by a vast, densely decorated alabaster canopy, displaying the armorial bearings of the Gerards and Radcliffes. The work was claimed by John Betjeman as the largest Elizabethan monument in England, and said to be executed \\"under the influence\\" of Joseph Hollemans, completed about 1612. Joseph, also known as Jasper, Hollemans was the son of Garrett Hollemans, a Dutch sculptor who fled to England in the 1580s and worked from Burton upon Trent, centre of alabaster carving in the 16th and 17th centuries.Victoria County History: Staffordshire - Volume 9, Burton-upon- Trent - Economic History, s.47 - Alabaster Carving Joseph worked for clients as illustrious as the House of Cavendish and the Spencer family of Althorp. While there is no evidence that he personally carved the memorial, it is in Burton alabaster of his style and period.

If this is the case a further conundrum as to the reason for their absence emerges. See Armit (2003) p. 135.

Five sites include menhirs and fifteen a red and black mortar. These features tends to support the hypothesis that the primary purpose of these buildings was ritualistic.Crawford (2002) pp. 123–4.

The highly restricted nature of their geographical locations suggests that they may have been contained within a political or cultural frontier of some kind.

Victoria Florence Sanger Freeman was a legendary figure in the circus world, where she gained and earned the title \\"the Queen of the Elephants\\". She was born on 28 September 1895 into a renowned family which was commanded to appear and perform at Windsor Castle by Queen Victoria. Early life Her father having married a cousin, made the young Victoria a Sanger on both sides of the family. She was the great-granddaughter of the original 'Lord' George Sanger. He had bestowed this courtesy peerage on himself when faced with a court battle with Bill Cody, alias Buffalo Bill. On her father's side, she was also a great-granddaughter of Lord George's brother, John. For many years she travelled with the Lord John Sanger Circus (a group of entertainers which had been formed by him). Career As a young lady, 'Vicky' had established a good reputation within the circus industry before the outbreak of the First World War. As a bareback rider, she worked with a large group of elephants, comprising several magnificent pachyderms: Annie, Betty, Jinny and Tiny. Having gained such an enviable reputation, Sanger Freeman used her gifts and talents in other big tops. For the first two or three years of the Bertram Mills Circus at Olympia, London, which started in 1920, the Sanger family provided the hub of the performances held there. Later, Sanger Freeman became the last surviving member of the Mills troupe. She also provided the backbone of the annual Christmas Circus at the Crystal Palace in South London. In 1917 she married James Freeman, a trapeze artiste, highwire walker and clown, among other roles. He was considered to be the most versatile of all British circus performers in his heyday and as a clown under the name of 'Pimpo' was one of the country's most popular jesters. Plans of their marriage did not meet family approval and the two had to meet in secret. The wedding, which was carried out at Burstow Church, was also carried out unknown to her family. The circus show finally ended in 1962, ending a family tradition which had spanned 117 years. Later years James Freeman died in 1961 and Victoria spent her last years quietly in Brixton. Victoria Sanger Freeman died in August 1991. Her ashes were placed in the family plot at Margate where Sanger's 'Hall by the Sea' was — at one time — a crowd puller at the seaside town. She was the last of the great Sanger dynasty. Her obituary appeared in The Daily Telegraph on 21 August 1991. She had a son, Pat, who followed the family footsteps as a clown. He died at an early age while performing in a circus in Switzerland.

Born the son of recognized painter, Hubert Shuptrine (1936-2006), Alan has continued the legacy of realism that both Andrew Wyeth and his father Hubert established.  Biography = Childhood and Education  Born in 1963, Alan was raised in more than 20 Appalachian Mountain towns along the Eastern seaboard. During 1970- 1974, while the family was living in Highlands, North Carolina, his father began writing his first book, _Jericho: The South Beheld_ ,(Oxmoor House, 1974). The book, written alongside famed author, James Dickey, was published in 1974, sold over 1 million copies worldwide, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for the art book category, and received the coveted Carey-Thomas Award for Creative Publishing. It was during this time in the mountains that ignited Alan's love of the land, and culture found throughout the Appalachians. Using Highlands as home base, Hubert would travel all over the South for his inspirations, and he would often take Alan along. Hubert became Alan's mentor and teacher. When Alan was a toddler, he would watch his father paint at his easel for hours at a time. Alan states, \\"He would take the brush, dip it in water, tap the feral on the edge, and while that ringing held constant in the air, he would mix paint and apply it to textured watercolor paper. I would even listen to the friction as the brush scraped along. It was mesmerizing!\\" In 1975, the family returned to Chattanooga where Alan attended school on Lookout Mountain before beginning The Baylor School (Chattanooga, TN) in 1976. After graduation from high school, Alan continued his education at The University of the South (Sewanee, TN); and The University of Tennessee (Knoxville, TN).  Framing / Restoration / Water Gilding  In 1985, after graduation from college, Alan began working his father, who at the time was writing his second book, _Home to Jericho_ (Oxmoor House, 1987). Alan began framing for his father, handcrafting his own custom, water gilded frames. This in turn led to framing for other prominent artists including Andrew Wyeth. As his reputation as a master framer and water gilder spread, in 1987 Alan began his own company, Gold Leaf Designs, Inc. (Chattanooga, TN). While continuing to frame for his father, he also began framing for museums, art galleries, artists, historical institutions, designers, and interior decorators. Custom design frame making, water gilding, and gold leaf restorations are elusive, but sought after, crafts. Gold Leaf Designs, Inc, became renowned for handcrafting one-of-a-kind mirrors and furniture, as well as creating gilded walls, ceilings, and objects of art. Period restoration and conservation of gilded objects became a large part of the business and Alan's frames and period restorations can be found nationwide, in museums, historical institutions, and private collections, including The Greenville County Museum of Art (Greenville, SC) , The Hunter Museum of American Art (Chattanooga, TN), The Birmingham Museum of Art (Birmingham, AL), The Huntsville Museum of Art (Huntsville, AL), The Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, (Montgomery, AL), The Tennessee State Museum (Nashville, TN), The New Orleans Museum of Art (Louisiana), and The Columbia Museum of Art (Columbia, South Carolina). In 2005, following the devastation from Hurricane Katrina, The New Orleans Museum of Art reached out to Alan for on-site repairs and restorations of the frames and gilded objects within the permanent collection. He has also provided extensive period restoration and conservation for numerous museums and historical institutions, including Melrose Plantation at Natchez National Historical Park, The Philip Schutze Collection at the Atlanta History Center's historical Swan House, the Governor's Mansion of Georgia, the Governor's Mansion of South Carolina, the President James K. Polk Home and Museum , and Cheekwood Estate and Gardens (Nashville, TN).  Watercolor Career  Though framing and restoration became a primary focus, Alan continued to paint and be mentored by his father. In 2005, Hubert Shuptrine was awarded the Tennessee Governor's Arts Award by the Tennessee Arts Commission and then-Governor, Phil Bredesen. It was an honor for Alan to be present with his father during this time, as he served as Hubert's representative for the previous 15 years. Sadly, Hubert passed away in 2006 following some health issues. Alan Shuptrine's painting style is Realism, much like his father's, with highly detailed and dramatic lighting in his landscapes and figurative paintings. Shuptrine's medium is primarily watercolor which he applies and controls in various techniques, from wet-in- wet to drybrush. He also creates using egg tempera, oil, the centuries-old art of water gilding with genuine gold leaf, wood carving, and sgraffito. He prefers to handcraft and carve his own frames for his paintings, a practice of two of his influences: James McNeill Whistler, and Charles Prendergast. His other influences include the works of his father, Hubert Shuptrine, Andrew Wyeth, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Stephen Scott Young, and John Singer Sargent. Recognized by publications such as American Artist Magazine and Watercolor Artist Magazine, Shuptrine garnered additional recognition when he was asked to participate in the exhibit, “In the Tradition of Wyeth: Contemporary Watercolor Masters” at The Vero Beach Museum of Art in 2010. The exhibition opened with Alan's paintings displayed alongside the works by Andrew Wyeth and his father. Following the Vero Beach exhibition, Shuptrine participated in a solo 2-year, 4 museum run in 2017-2019 with the exhibition, Alan Shuptrine: Appalachian Watercolors of the Serpentine Chain. The exhibition was displayed at the Morris Museum of Art (Augusta, GA), the Huntsville Museum of Art and The Tennessee State Museum. All three fine American museums selected Shuptrine's watercolors for their permanent collections. His solo exhibition opened at the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville and celebrated the Celtic roots of the Appalachian Mountains. Serving as a monument to the descendants of early English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh who settled the Eastern Seaboard, this art collection will collectively preserve mountain heritage and traditions for future generations.  Paintings  A selection of Alan's watercolor paintings can be viewed on his website, www.AlanShuptrine.com  Book  In 2019-2020, Shuptrine kicked off a literary collaboration with National Geographic's Person of the Year, and Appalachian Trail expert, best-selling author Jennifer Pharr Davis. This fine art, coffee-table book is self-published and titled I Come From A Place. This thematic book contains a collection of images from Shuptrine's museum exhibition, as well as newer watercolors. Complimented by Pharr Davis’ prose , the paintings serve to collectively preserve and celebrate the mountain heritage and traditions for future generations. The book was awarded the Independent Publisher's Book Award for Best Southeastern Non-Fiction Book for 2020. Shuptrine continues to create bodies of work, including the upcoming exhibition, Climbing Trees for 2020/2021, as well as providing appearances at showcases for his book at multiple venues. He also provides numerous watercolor lessons and workshops, geared towards all levels of artists. He has become a frequent fixture at Southeastern museums for his watercolor workshops and demonstrations, and he also provides private lessons, often in his Lookout Mountain, Georgia studio. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Alan has begun offering virtual workshops and lessons in large group settings via ZOOM and Facebook Live, as well as smaller groups settings and individual lessons.  Personal Life  Alan Shuptrine and his wife Bonny currently reside in Lookout Mountain, Georgia. They have 2 grown sons, Jake Shuptrine, who is an engineer in Atlanta, Georgia; and Ben Shuptrine, who is a graphic designer in Chattanooga, Tennessee. They own Shuptrine's Gallery, located in the Broad Street Design District in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

For Alan Shuptrine, it has literally been a family passion as he has followed his father into this most demanding medium to great acclaim for them both. Years ago, I had the privilege of visiting Winslow Homer's studio and found on the wall written in pencil the following words in Homer's own hand. “Oh what a friend chance can be, when it chooses.” The finest watercolor artists may embrace the “happy accident” now and then, but there is nothing accidental, and everything intentional when Alan captures a moment in life for the viewer to have, keep and cherish. It is artwork to be admired and embraced for all time. The eye delights, and the mind engages. -Jim Dicke CEO, Crown Equipment Corporation Shuptrine's drybrush watercolors depend on a delicate but precise touch, like the lyrical melodic line of a flat-picked mountain guitar. Drybrush is a difficult technique pioneered by another well-known storyteller, Andrew Wyeth, whose influence on Alan's work is undeniable. These words and pictures are like a series of sweet mountain melodies, gathered into a songbook to celebrate Appalachia in warm humanistic terms. -Jay Williams Former Curator, Vero Beach Museum of Art For Alan, the love of Appalachian life is deep rooted. It has been woven into in his creative DNA from his days hiking the Blue Ridge and Smoky Mountains with his father, to time spent visiting the remote hill towns with their fiercely independent people. Alan's subjects and compositions capture a feeling of American country life steeped in a spirit similar to that of Andrew Wyeth. -Christopher Madkour Executive Director, Huntsville Museum of Art Alan Shuptrine created a body of work that celebrates the connections of our Appalachian Mountains. His paintings embody the spirit of the land in the craft of its people. The work of Alan Shuptrine is represented in the collection of the Tennessee State Museum because of his artistic excellence and connection to Tennessee, and America's, history. -Ashley Howell Executive Director, Tennessee State Museum  References  Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:1963 births Category:Realist painters Category:Living people ","title":"Alan Shuptrine"},{"id":"18718211","text":"The Eighteen Greater Texts, known as Patiṉeṇmēlkaṇakku () in the literature, is the collection of the oldest surviving Tamil poetry.

Some historical accounts contend that Dr François Carlo Antommarchi (one of several doctors who encircled Napoleon's deathbed) cast the original \\"parent mould\\", which would later be used to reproduce bronze and additional plaster copies. Other records, however, indicate that Dr Francis Burton, a surgeon attached to the British Army's Sixty-Sixth Regiment at St. Helena, presided at the emperor's autopsy and during that postmortem procedure cast the original mould. Antommarchi obtained from his British colleagues a secondary plaster mould from Burton's original cast. With that second-generation mould, Antommarchi in France reportedly made further copies of the death mask in plaster as well as in bronze. Yet another contention regarding the origins of the death mask and its copies is that Madame Bertrand, Napoleon's attendant on St. Helena, allegedly stole part of the original cast, leaving Burton with only the ears and back of the head. The British doctor subsequently sued Bertrand to retrieve the cast, but failed to do so in court. A year later Madame Bertrand gave Antommarchi a copy of the mask, from which he had several copies made. One of those he sent to Lord Burghersh, the British envoy (representative) in Florence, asking him to pass it to the famous sculptor, Antonio Canova. Unfortunately Canova died before he had time to use the mask and instead the piece remained with Burghersh. The National Museums Liverpool version, cast by E. Quesnel, is thought to be a descendant of that mask. Some people believe that Dr Antommarchi lived in Cuba for a short period of time and contracted yellow fever. While there he lived on his cousin's coffee plantation and became close to General Juan de Moya. Before Dr Antommarchi died, he made General Moya a death mask from his mould. It is believed that the mask still resides in The Museum in Santiago de Cuba, province of Oriente, where there was a large group of French immigrants that established coffee plantations in the high mountains of the Sierra Maestra. New Orleans authorities moved their death mask in 1853. During the tumult that accompanied the Civil War, the mask disappeared. A former city treasurer spotted the mask in 1866 as it was being hauled to the dump in a junk wagon. Rather than return the mask to the city, the treasurer took the mask home and put it on display there. Eventually Napoleon's death mask wound up in the Atlanta home of Captain William Greene Raoul, president of the Mexican National Railroad. Finally, in 1909, Napoleon's death mask made its way back to New Orleans. Captain Raoul read a newspaper article about the missing mask and wrote to the mayor of its whereabouts. In exchange for suitable acknowledgement, Raoul agreed to donate the death mask to New Orleans. The mayor transferred the mask to the Louisiana State Museum that year. Locations In 1834, Dr. Antommarchi traveled to the United States, visited New Orleans, and presented that city with a bronze copy of the mask. The French doctor also gave a painted plaster copy to a colleague in New Orleans, Dr. Edwin Smith. Following the death of Dr. Smith, the plaster mask was given to the family of Captain Francis Bryan, a resident of St. Louis, Missouri. In 1894, Bryan donated this mask to his alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. During its first years in Chapel Hill, Napoleon's plaster face was displayed as a curio on a table in the office of UNC President George T. Winston. The death mask was later transferred to the university library and ultimately found its way to the library's North Carolina Collection. Today, the mask remains in remarkably good condition. The only visible damage to it is a chip above the emperor's upper lip. That damage occurred in 1907, when a janitor at the university overturned the mask while dusting it. On the underside of the mask is the handwritten inscription: \\"Dr. Edwin B. Smith's head of Nap.n\\" and \\"Presented to Dr. Smith by N[ap's] Phys'n. Dr.Ant[tommarchi].\\" Also written on the bottom of the mask is \\"Tête d'Armée\\" (\\"Head of the Army\\"), reportedly the last words uttered by Napoleon. Dr. Antommarchi moved to Cuba in 1838. While there, he lived on his cousin's coffee plantation and became close to General Juan de Moya. Before Dr. Antommarchi died, he made General Moya a death mask from his mould. It is believed that the mask still resides in the Museum in Santiago de Cuba, province of Oriente, where there were many French immigrants who established coffee plantations in the high mountains of the Sierra Maestra. A bronze death mask is in the collection of the Auckland Art Gallery; it was donated by Sir George Grey and is attributed to Antommarchi.Death Mask of Napoleon Another death mask formerly owned by John Codman Ropes now resides in the lobby of Boston University's Mugar Library.http://www.mhsm.org/history.htm ReferencesExternal links * The Story of Napoleon's Death-mask: Told from the Original Documents * \\"Les Masques Mortuaires De Napoleon\\" * \\"Le Masque Mortuaire Dit 'Malmaison'\\" * \\"Le Masque Mortuaire Dit 'Arnott'\\" * \\"Le Masque Mortuaire Dit 'Burghersh'\\" * \\"La Fameuse 'Collection D'Essling'\\" * \\"Totenmaske\\" (Bronze des Napoleon Bonaparte); Palais Mamming Museum, Merano, Italy Category:Napoleon Category:Death masks Category:Masks in Europe ","title":"Death mask of Napoleon"},{"id":"18718230","text":"George H.

Summary Shalinsky, a Jewish university student, is convinced that his non-Jewish professor Mortimer Griffin is guilty of changing his name, suspecting the instructor of hiding his Jewish identity. After listening attentively to Griffin's analysis of Kafka’s The Metamorphosis, all the other students file out of the classroom, but Shalinsky lingers to compliment his teacher.

Griffin is amused at first, and tells his Jewish friends about the incident. However, Shalinsky persists, and simply won't accept that Griffin is not Jewish. Eventually, Griffin gets more and more irritated by Shalinsky's refusal to accept the truth. Finally, irritation gives way to anger and Griffin blurts out comments that sound anti-Semitic.

Key missions of the IRTS include promoting amateur radio experimentation and representing the interests of Irish amateur radio operators before Irish and international telecommunications regulatory authorities. In particular, since 2005 in agreement with Communications Regulator (Comreg), the IRTS supports the entire examination process for the Experimenter's Licence including setting, organising, and correcting examinations for the Irish amateur radio license.

IRTS is the national member society representing Ireland in the International Amateur Radio Union.International Amateur Radio Union (2008). \\"Member Societies\\". Retrieved 1 August 2008.  History  Radio in Ireland can be traced back to the 1800s with Professor George Francis Fitzgerald of TCD who in conjunction with Heinrich Hertz clarified and confirmed James Clerk Maxwell's mathematical theories of the electromagnetic field. This work led Fitzgerald to conclude in 1883 that an oscillating electric current would produce electromagnetic waves, which was experimentally confirmed by Heinrich Hertz in 1888 and used in the development of wireless telegraphy. Fitzgerald was the first to suggest a method of producing radio frequency waves which forms the basis for modern radio. An early pioneer of experimental radio in Ireland was Colonel M.J.B. Dennis who in 1898 at his home in Baltinglass, Co. Wicklow carried out experiments into radio transmissions. In 1913 he was one of the founding members of the Dublin Wireless Club. In 1922 the Radio Society of Ireland was founded as a National Society. The National Society and the Dublin Wireless club merged into the Wireless Society of Ireland in 1925, by this time broadcast radio was becoming popular, and a year later the first National Station 2RN started broadcasting. The original \\"Irish Radio Transmitters Society\\" was formed in 1926 by members of the WSI who were more interested in the construction of amateur transmitters and receivers rather than broadcast equipment. The IRTS that exists today consists of an amalgamation in 1932 of this group with the Wireless Society of Ireland. The first president of IRTS was Colonel Dennis, who by then had the call sign EI2B. He held office for many years and was active in amateur affairs until the war brought a stop to these in 1939. Colonel Dennis died in 1945 in his early eighties.  Services  The IRTS produces a magazine Echo Ireland, detailing activities and information about Amateur Radio in Ireland, which is available to all members by post or online. A weekly news service is also broadcast on amateur radio frequencies. Members may use the QSL card service and avail of the technical panel for help in with aspects of amateur radio. Throughout the year the society organises amateur radio contests on frequencies from 70 cm to 80m.  Examinations  Since 2005 the IRTS supports the entire examination process for the Experimenter's Licence. The society provides a course guide for the CEPT Class B exam and examinations are held twice yearly. A separate morse code test can be arranged for those wanting to obtain a CEPT Class A license, which allows the operator to apply for a two letter callsign and may allow the operator to operate equipment in countries where morse code is still a requirement. Membership of the IRTS is not required to sit these exams.

The temple (known as a mithraeum) was located 137m to the west of the castra. It is not currently visible to visitors to the site.  Discovery  The site of the shrine was first discovered in 1844 when the local farmer uncovered a statue and five altars in his field. The statue was broken up (and subsequently lost); however, the altars were all saved. The five altars were: 1) .RIB 1394. CIMRM 840. To the god. Lucius Sentius Castus, centurion of the 6th legion gave this. 2) .RIB 1395 To the invincible god Mithras, Publius Aelius Titullus, prefect, gladly, willingly and deservedly fulfilled his vow. 3) .RIB 1396 To the Invincible Sun. Tiberius Claudius Decimus Cornelius Antonius, Prefect, restored the temple. 4) RIB 1397. CIMRM 842. 5) No inscription. The location of the discovery was marked on contemporaneous maps, enabling the archaeologist J.P. Gillam to relocate the shrine and excavate it in 1953.J P Gillam, I MacIvor & E Birley. 1954. 'The Temple of Mithras at Rudchester'. Archaeologia Aeliana (4th series) XXXII, 176-219  The Mithraeum Phase I  Gillam identified two distinct phases of use consisting of two successive temples on the site. He deduced that the first temple was built in the late second or early third century AD. Oriented east to west, the shrine formed a rectangle 12 x 6.02m in size with a small apse in the west end-wall. The plan was typical of mithraic temples in that it consisted of a central nave flanked by low benches. The building was constructed in stone with clay used to bond the blocks. A roughly-built narthex (or ante-chapel) was later added to the outside of the east wall, 3m in depth and 6m in width. It was placed asymmetrically in line with the south wall so that there was no direct view from the front entrance into the temple. Similar to the shrine at Carrawburgh this anteroom contained a low stone bench which may have been used in initiation rites. The east wall, however, was built over a badly filled-in pit and the subsequent subsidence caused the collapse of the structure.  The Mithraeum Phase II  The mithraeum was rebuilt soon after, but without the ante-room. Access was now directly into the shrine from the outside, and it is unusual that the community would not have wanted at least some form of ante-chamber, especially as they also reduced the free space within the shrine by extending the benches. The interior of the shrine was remodelled to include a stone podium in front of the apse (presumably for the tauroctony) and the lengthening of the benches. A new roof system was also put in with wooden posts standing in front of the benches. Five small uninscribed altars were found inside the nave, and the remains of a water-basin were recovered about two-thirds of the way along the northern bench. Gillam found two heads of the torch-bearers Cautes and Cautopates, and speculated that this was the result of a deliberate decapitation of the statues. The lack of any trace of the tauroctony was also used to argue for a deliberate desecration of the shrine; however, in the absence of any single fragment of it and without knowing what the statue smashed in 1844 was of, it is hard to say for sure. Certainly pottery evidence spread over the temple shows that it was out of use by the mid-fourth century. All the finds and altars were placed in the Museum of Antiquities at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, which has since closed. The exhibits have now been transferred to the new Great North Museum nearby.

In addition to high popularity and strong sales, both titles were helmed by respected, established writers, in Chris Claremont (X-Men) and Marv Wolfman (Teen Titans). Given the success of each title, Marvel and DC recognized the sales potential of a jointly published crossover, with X-Men writer Chris Claremont scripting the story and Walt Simonson and Terry Austin providing the art. The comic was lettered by X-Men letterer Tom Orzechowski and edited by the X-Men's Louise Jones. Len Wein, the editor of The New Teen Titans, acted as DC's liaison with Marvel on the project. Plot summary Seeking to co-opt the near-limitless power of the Source, the evil space tyrant Darkseid continues his efforts to break through the Source Wall, which is depicted as a physical wall for the very first time in this story. Thinking that the energy associated with the Phoenix Force can help him penetrate the mysteries of the Source, Darkseid sets into motion a plan to recreate the Dark Phoenix by tapping into the memories of her former teammates, the X-Men, as well as drawing the residue of her power from a variety of sources, and then amplifying that residue, using energy streaming from the rupture of the Source Wall. With his help, Metron had pierced the Wall and his sacrifice effected a small rupture which bled a steady stream of energy. Both superhero teams are alerted to the dangers by the Titans' Starfire, who has knowledge of Dark Phoenix's immense destructive power. Despite their best efforts, each team is defeated and captured by Deathstroke the Terminator and Darkseid's shock troops. Darkseid brings the Dark Phoenix back to life. Both super-teams work together, freeing themselves and defeating their enemies in a climatic battle. Colossus prevents the gathering of psionic residue at a western mesa and this results in the Dark Phoenix simulation being flawed, and exploiting said flaw enables the two teams to drive a wedge between Dark Phoenix and Darkseid. Professor X and Cyclops convince what is left of Jean Grey's human consciousness that she is being manipulated, and she once again sacrifices herself to defeat Darkseid, repairing all the damage in doing so. What had been Darkseid is now part of the Source Wall, and Metron returns home, whatever he sought having been attained.  Critical response  The Slings and Arrows Comic Guide wrote that \\"Claremont courageously defies tradition by filling an unbalanced basket of guest stars, and Walt Simonson's first-rate pencils contribute to the finest Marvel/DC co-production.\\" Comics historian Matthew K. Manning calls it \\"one of the most well-received crossovers of its time - or of any time for that matter.\\"  Aborted sequel  Despite the success of the project, The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans represented the last new DC–Marvel intercompany crossover for over a decade. A planned \\"X-Men/Teen Titans\\" #2, by the Titans creative team of Marv Wolfman and George Pérez, was scheduled for publication near Christmas 1983.\\"Titans Tower,\\" The New Teen Titans #29 (March 1983).\\"Titans Tower,\\" The New Teen Titans #38 (January 1984). X-Men writer Claremont had shared details of future X-Men storylines with Wolfman to facilitate Wolfman's writing of the script.Wolfman interview, Amazing Heroes #50 (Fantagraphics Books, July 1984). Pérez was slated to draw the much-anticipated JLA/Avengers intercompany crossover due for publication in 1984, which was eventually scuttled due to editorial squabbling between the two companies. Continuing disagreements between Marvel and DC and Pérez's anger over the demise of the JLA/Avengers book resulted in the eventual cancellation of X-Men/Teen Titans #2 as well.

This film examines diversity from a child's perspective and was screened at the White House to an audience of more than 100 leaders of national children's, family, education and civil rights organizations in December 2000.Chasnoff, Debra. Subject:White House screening of That’s A Family! Huge Success. Message to Sue Rochman. 21 Dec. 2000. E-mail. That’s a Family! has been widely praised by those supporting its role in diversity education but also widely attacked by conservative organizations that consider it to be gay propaganda and inappropriate for a young audience.Kiritsky, L.

Paid inclusion controversy In March 2004, Yahoo! launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo! search engine after payment. This scheme was lucrative but proved unpopular both with website marketers (who were reluctant to pay), and the public (who were unhappy about the paid-for listings being indistinguishable from other search results). As of October 2006, Paid Inclusion ceased to guarantee any commercial listing and only helped the paid inclusion customers, by crawling their site more often and by providing some statistics on the searches that led to the page and some additional smart links (provided by customers as feeds) below the actual URL. Adware and spyware Yahoo! has also been criticized for funding spyware and adware — advertising from Yahoo!'s clients often appears on-screen in pop-ups generated from adware that a user may have installed on their computer without realizing it by accepting online offers to download software to fix computer clocks or improve computer security, add browser enhancements, etc. The frequency of advertising pop-ups for spyware, generated from a partnership with advertising distributor Walnut Ventures, who had a direct partnership with Direct Revenue, could be increased or decreased based on Yahoo!'s immediate revenue needs, according to some former employees in Yahoo!'s sales department. Work in the People's Republic of China Yahoo!, along with Google China, Microsoft, Cisco, AOL, Skype, Nortel and others, has cooperated with the Communist Party of China in implementing a system of Internet censorship in mainland China. Unlike Google or Microsoft, which generally keep confidential records of its users outside mainland China, Yahoo! stated that the company cannot protect the privacy and confidentiality of its mainland Chinese customers from the authorities.Gunther, Marc. Tech execs get grilled over mainland China business: Yahoo, Google, Microsoft and Cisco, facing attack in Congress, say they're doing more good than harm in China .\\" CNN. February 16, 2006. Critics say that the companies put profits before principles. Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders state that it is \\"ironic that companies whose existence depends on freedom of information and expression have taken on the role of censor.\\" Outing of Chinese dissidents Shi Tao = In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported that in April 2005, Shi Tao, a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the Changsha Intermediate People's Court of Hunan Province, China (First trial case no. 29), for \\"providing state secrets to foreign entities\\". The \\"secrets\\" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia Democracy Forum before the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The verdict as published by the Chinese government stated that Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account, that Yahoo! Holdings (the Hong Kong subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the Hunan newspaper that Shi Tao worked for, and that police went straight to his offices and picked him up. In February 2006, Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao. In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data. On 2 June 2006, the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland (NUJ) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China. In July 2007, evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting \\"State Secrets\\" as the charge against Shi Tao. The warrant requests \\"Email account registration information for huoyan1989@yahoo.com.cn, all login times, corresponding IP addresses, and relevant email content from February 22, 2004 to present.\\" Analyst reports and human rights organizations have said that this evidence directly contradicts Yahoo!'s testimony before the U.S. Congress in February 2006. Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating. = Li Zhi = Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of dissident Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for \\"inciting subversion\\". = Wang Xiaoning = Wang Xiaoning is a Chinese dissident from Shenyang who was arrested by authorities of the People's Republic of China for publishing controversial material online. In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in September 2002 after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In September 2003, Wang was convicted of charges of \\"incitement to subvert state power\\" and sentenced to ten years in prison. On April 18, 2007, Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in San Francisco, California, United States. Wang Xiaoning is named as a plaintiff in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the World Organization for Human Rights USA. \\"Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the group. \\"Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.\\" Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in The Washington Post and many media sources: :The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in September 2002. The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation. Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed: :In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the Alien Tort Claims Act, which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the Founding Fathers in 1789 for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s. On August 28, 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information (email and IP address) with the Chinese government that caused the arrests of writers and dissidents. The lawsuit was filed in San Francisco for journalists, Shi Tao, and Wang Xiaoning. Yahoo! stated that it supported privacy and free expression for it worked with other technology companies to solve human rights concerns. On November 6, 2007, the US congressional panel criticised Yahoo! for not giving full details to the House Foreign Affairs Committee the previous year, stating it had been \\"at best inexcusably negligent\\" and at worst \\"deceptive\\". User-created chat rooms, message boards, and profiles As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo!'s \\"user created\\" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005. Yahoo! News' message board section was closed December 19, 2006, due to the trolling phenomenon. In addition, in mid-October, 2008, Yahoo! deleted all information in millions of user profiles with no advance notice and little explanation.Is Your Yahoo Profile Deleted, Missing or Blank?

Shark fin controversy Yahoo! is a 14.95% owner of Alibaba, which facilitates the sale of shark-derived products. After investing in Alibaba, Yahoo! executives were asked about this issue, and responded: \\"We know the sale of shark products is both legal in Asia and a centuries-old tradition.

At one point it was the third most-browsed site on the World Wide Web. Yahoo! later purchased GeoCities in 1999. Ten years later Yahoo! closed Geocities, deleting millions of web pages in the process. In September 2009, a month before it was closed, GeoCities received 10,477,049 unique visitors.  Yahoo!

Policy requiring a phone number In December 2016, Yahoo began forcing users of their email service to include a phone number with their profile, the lack of which denies access to their e-mail accounts. Data breaches The company reported two major data breaches of user account data to hackers during the second half of 2016. The first announced breach, reported in September 2016, had occurred sometime in late 2014, and affected over 500 million Yahoo! user accounts. A separate data breach, occurring earlier around August 2013, was reported in December 2016, and affected over 1 billion user accounts. Both breaches are considered the largest discovered in the history of the Internet. Specific details of material taken include names, email addresses, telephone numbers, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers, dates of birth, and encrypted passwords. Further, Yahoo! reported that the late 2014 breach likely used manufactured web cookies to falsify login credentials, allowing hackers to gain access to any account without a password. Yahoo! has been criticized for their late disclosure of the breaches and their security measures, and is currently facing several lawsuits as well as investigation by members of the United States Congress. The breaches have also put into question Verizon Communications's July 2016 plans to acquire Yahoo! for about $4.8 billion. Cancelling user's account without notice  Yahoo Terms of Service allow them to cancel a user's account, without notice, at their own discretion. Some users have lost access to their data, including personal pictures, with no means of recovery. Allegations of sexism against men Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated \\"Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees\\". In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received \\"fully satisfactory\\" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News. The lawsuit states: \\"Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext.\\" A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Mayer has faced in 2016.  Illegally accessing user accounts  In October 2019, A former Yahoo engineer named, Reyes Daniel Ruiz pleaded guilty to charges of illegally accessing user accounts by a federal court in San Jose. He had hacked about 6,000 user's accounts including his friends, co-workers and many young women during his hacking campaign, seeking sexual images and videos.

When a negotiation concluded successfully (i.e. a transaction occurs), iOffer charged a \\"final value fee\\" based on a sliding scale. The website advertised this distinction, claiming: \\"This is not an auction. It's better!\\" iOffer permitted free listing of items for sale, charging fees only when items were sold or for premium listing services (such as bolding, highlighting, and listing on the home page). Sellers could post an asking price or request offers; buyers, in turn, could purchase an item at its asking price or make an offer. Users could also post \\"want ads\\" at no charge and barter. All transactions were recorded and could be viewed by other users. iOffer competed with other similar negotiated e-commerce websites, as well as online auction sites such as eBay. According to Greg Holden, author of multiple books about eBay, from the perspective of sellers iOffer was both a \\"complement\\" and \\"good alternative\\" to eBay. Through iOffer's software program Mr. Grabber, sellers could relist items from eBay onto iOffer en masse, as well as import eBay feedback ratings. Unlike sites such as eBay, however, iOffer provided little in the way of buyer or seller protection from fraudulent and other problem transactions. However, it did operate a C.O.P.S. scheme, similar to eBay's VERO program for items such as those involving counterfeit goods. Additionally, purchases with PayPal may be covered under PayPal's buyer protection program for items that were not received or not significantly as described. While iOffer did not provide customer service via telephone, email customer service was available through the helpdesk, although form letter responses were the most likely response to most inquiries. In a January 2011, survey of more than 2,800 online sellers by the website AuctionBytes.com, iOffer ranked 16th out of 16 marketplaces with an overall rating of 3.6 out of 10, just behind eBay's 14th place rank with 4.2 out of 10. iOffer's highest marks were for Ease of Use (4.42/10) and its lowest marks were for Would Recommend This Site (3.14/10). In March 2019, it was reported that the IACC (International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition) had blocked iOffer's access to most if not all methods of payment, forcing the site to temporarily shut down. In December 2019, iOffer’s website stated that it had terminated all services permanently.

Today the museum is one of the largest museums in the region. The facades, roof and stairs in the building that houses the art collections have been registered as historical monuments since 29 October 1975. On 18 December 2011 the museum closed its doors for what was initially expected to be two years at most, to carry out extension expansion work. Due to problems associate with the discovery of ground water in the foundations, which required almost four years of additional work, the reopening of the entire building (renamed the \\"Art Museum of Nantes\\") was postponed until 23 June 2013.  Overview  Founded under the Consulate, the Fine Arts Museum of Nantes receives work purchased by state and the central museum deposits (the Louvre). It takes from the 19th century where it was an important place in the French public collections through the purchase by the city of Nantes in the collection of the brothers Pierre and François Cacault. The fund, with major works, were later supplemented by several other direct or law given gifts, and a purchasing policy supported by the friends of the museum. Compounding this today adds to this rich set of deposits of work of the Regional Contemporary Art Funds of the Loire and the Centre Pompidou. The museum offers an overview of all the main French and European art movements, which places its collections among the largest public collections of province alongside some of Museums of Fine Arts of Valenciennes, Grenoble, Lyon, Lille and Montpellier.  Origins  It benefits in 1804 and 1809 to send to the state of 43 paintings taken from the reserves of the Central Museum. These works came from the former royal collection, from churches and convents of Paris of the revolutionary and Napoleonic conquests. But it is the purchase of the collection by the Cacault brothers by the city in 1810 that gives the museum of Nantes its riches and variety. According to an inventory conducted in 1818, the collection Cacault was then the richest collections of painting that existed outside of Paris, since it had 1,155 paintings, 64 sculptures, and 134 collections of prints. It was not until 1830 that the collections were presented to the public on the floor of the hall with paintings (located on the street of Feltre to the sight of the old market of Feltre) This space quickly proved to be too small. In 1891, the city decided to build a designed to preserve and present them to the public in good conditions. A square plot near the school and the botanical garden, is chosen to host the future Palace of Fine Arts. The project was in the public competition as the “museum of paintings and sculptures.”  Architecture  Building from 1893 = The winner, the original Nantes architect Clement-Marie Josso, designed the plans for Palace of Fine Arts according to the principles of recent museums of Lille and Amiens. The plan was organized around a central courtyard covered with a glass roof. A dual circuit galleries and room surrounded it on two levels behind a monumental double staircase and a vaulted vestibule. The rooms on the bottom floor are lit by large windows, those on the floor have a modern overhead lighting made possible by the metal frame of the whole. The architectural eclecticism meets the triumph of architects at the Universal Exhibition of 1900 (inauguration year of the museum) and take their revenge on the engineers of the 1889. The small hole between the Ionic columns hold art allegories and architecture in the middle on top of the entry door. This monument of the late 19th century, the museum was able to fit the chronological presentation of enriched collections. Meanwhile, an ambitious temporary exhibition allows the spread of heritage and contemporary creation. From 1985 to 1990, the building also housed the bulk of the funds from municipal library of the city before it was finally installed in the new Jacques Demy-media library which was located on the . = Future Museum of Arts = In 2011, the museum was closed for a maximum of 2 years to make major expansion work to increase its area to 17,000 m2, versus 11,400 m2, and to enclose the chapel of the Oratory (serving as a place of temporary exhibitions for the museum) nearby, constructing new buildings according to the plans of the architect, British Stanton Williams, instead of commercial constructions. This work includes: the expansion of 2,500 m2 for exhibition area (mainly dedicated to contemporary art), the development of an auditorium of 180 seats in the patio, improving access to the entire building, and the reception staff to more appropriate premises. However, the discovery of significant water pipes at the construction site delayed progress, forcing architects to change their plans and adding an additional cost of 10 million euros. For all the exhibition spaces, reopening of the museum will finally take place in December 2016, after 3 years of delay while the former work schedule planned to reopen in two phases: 2016 and 2018 extension for the historic building.

The station opened in 1884 and closed in 1967.  Early years  New Romney & Littlestone-on-Sea station, 1952 The station was opened by the Lydd Railway Company on 19 June 1884, the first day of passenger services on its 3-mile branch to New Romney from its existing line between Appledore and Dungeness. At the time, a Victorian block of houses and hotels had been constructed in Littlestone-on-Sea in the hope of creating a seaside resort. Both railway branches were served by the same train from Appledore; in some cases it went to either New Romney or Dungeness, in others, passengers for New Romney were left at Lydd while the train proceeded to Dungeness with the Lydd stationmaster who would sell tickets to passengers alighting there. The train then returned to Lydd, dropped the Dungeness passengers there, and transported the New Romney passengers to their destination. The service to New Romney in 1905 comprised eight weekday departures from Appledore - four exclusively serving New Romney and four serving New Romney and Dungeness. There was a single Sunday working to New Romney.  Station buildings  New Romney and Littlestone station, which had the suffix on-sea added in 1888, was a small two-platformed terminus equipped with an equally small goods yard. The main station building was located on the down platform, while the goods shed was just to the south-west behind the platform together with coal wharves, an end loading dock, a water tower and other small buildings.Harding, P.A., op. cit. p. 15. In later years the up platform was hardly used other than as a livestock loading dock.Subterranea Britannica, \\"New Romney\\". In 1927, one of the sidings was extended across the road to deliver coal to the depot of the newly opened Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway (RHDR) which was to open its own New Romney station here.  Decline and closure  Station site in 1973, showing the base of the water tower to the right and the remains of one platform in the far distance. In the 1920s the long-awaited seaside development began in earnest. The Southern Railway (which had taken over the line upon the 1923 railway grouping) realigned the New Romney branch nearer the coast in 1937 and provided two intermediate stations - Greatstone-on-Sea and Lydd-on-Sea. However, the Southern had been slow in reacting to the coastal development and the RHDR had already been operating from more conveniently-sited stations for the best part of a decade. Furthermore, the pattern of services remained more or less the same until 1952 when it increased to nine services from Appledore to New Romney (including two through trains from Ashford), and four services on Sundays from Ashford. In addition, two direct services from Charing Cross were laid on for summer Saturdays.White, H.P., op. cit. p. 99. Following the electrification of the line to Dover in 1962 and the prohibition of steam on South Eastern metals, the New Romney branch was served by diesel-electric sets with either six-car or three-car units. Although through services from Charing Cross ceased, services remained relatively regular with nine departures from Ashford and two from Appledore on weekdays.White, H.P., op. cit. p. 100. The New Romney branch was listed for closure in the Beeching Report but survived until the Minister of Transport Barbara Castle announced her approval to close the Appledore to New Romney Branch and passenger services ceased on 6 March 1967.  Present day  Although the trackbed from Romney Junction towards New Romney is easily traceable, nothing remains of New Romney and Littlestone-on-Sea station which has been obliterated by a small trading estate. The site of the siding to the RHDR is now occupied by the west part of its New Romney station carriage sidings.White, H.P., op. cit. p. 171.

Dwight of Co. B, 70th New York Infantry Regiment. From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress The 70th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment was one of five infantry regiments formed by former U.S. Congressman Daniel Sickles and established as part of the Excelsior Brigade which fought with the Union Army during multiple key engagements of the American Civil War, including the Chancellorsville, Gettysburg and Overland campaigns. Leaders from the 70th New York recruited men from New Jersey, as well as from cities and small towns across the State of New York. Service The regiment was organized in New York City in May 1861 under the authority of the War Department as the 1st Regiment, Sickles' Brigade, at Camp Scott on Staten Island. It mustered into service on June 20, 1861. The 70th left the state for Washington, D.C., on July 23, 1861. It was subsequently attached to Sickles' Brigade, Division of the Potomac, until October, 1861. Then, it was reassigned to Sickles' Brigade, Hooker's Division, Army of the Potomac, until March 1862. (It was formally designated as the 70th Regiment New York Infantry on December 11, 1861.) The 70th was part of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, Third Army Corps, Army of the Potomac, until March 1864. Then it was in the 2nd Brigade, 4th Division, Second Army Corps until May 1864. It finished the war in the 4th Brigade, 3rd Division, Second Army Corps, until July 1864. Ordered to New York for muster out June 22, 1864. Veterans and Recruits were transferred to the 86th New York Infantry. The 70th mustered out on July 7, 1864, to date from July 1, 1864, after the expiration of its three-year term of enlistment.

IT can efficiently manage and allocate global help desk resources, including – most importantly – its personnel, to access any computer to provide support despite the end user or IT rep location. Virtual help desks allow IT reps to virtually access end systems through support sessions where they can diagnose and fix computer issues quickly. This eliminates in-person customer service calls and/or ineffective phone-only tech support sessions, making the help desk more efficient. Another objective of the virtual help desk is to improve IT resource management and save organization's money by increasing IT support efficiencies. Through an enhanced ability to allocate resources, IT organizations have the flexibility to create new ways of using its technical support knowledge-base. This technology usually requires a software implementation and support contract.  Application/ Techniques  Organizations can gain considerable infrastructure and cost savings by deploying virtualization technologies in hardware environments, such as data centers. However, the concept of virtualization can also be applied to the way people work. When applied to the help desk, this translates into the same number of technicians being able to handle more support incidents. As tech support problems are typically handled by the call center, contact center, or a help desk, either by telephone or remote desktop software, it’s important that technicians be able to work independently (or virtually) to quickly troubleshoot computer issues. The following points provide a quick overview of the benefits to an organization virtualizing its help desk: 1\\\\. Increased productivity: Companies can increase the number of support calls handled per day and cut the costs of lengthy service calls. Also, companies can eliminate the time and travel expense of technicians going on-site to resolve customer tech problems, improving IT resource management. 2\\\\. Efficient routing: As technology becomes more complex, a virtualized help desk provides the infrastructure to better manage decentralized IT operations and assign expert technicians across the queue to handle a particular tech support issue. This helps streamline the overall customer service process, while minimizing the time a support caller spends navigating through an automated phone tree. 3\\\\. Improved control: Putting a help desk rep in the driver's seat to troubleshoot computer issues not only enhances the customer experience by lessening frustration, but also reduces the stress and aggravation IT staff often face when walking non-tech savvy users through a tech support session. Ensuring that your help desk staff is happy when dealing with customers significantly helps your company build and maintain strong customer relations, not to mention reducing IT staff turnover rates. The virtual help desk resides between the systems management and service desk platforms to work with the systems that track when trouble tickets open and close, to provide an account of what happens during the support process. This level of granular support activity (e.g. the what, how, when, why and even whose mouse click is used) also helps organizations better manage its IT resources and optimize the help desk. Using a centralized, virtual help desk solution to capture important support details (e.g. record remote sessions, note where calls were transferred or how the issues were resolved) enables IT organizations to build an effective knowledge base. This increased level of understanding can be used in root cause analysis to minimize recurring help desk issues and begin to address the tech support issues that result in desktop incident resolution gap.  Example  Within the current workplace environment, technology is rapidly making geography irrelevant. Even small companies are doing business in countries around the globe. People are now working remotely. The growing number of remote workers and telecommuters have put increased pressure on IT networks, forcing administrators to spend an increasing amount of time trying to fix users’ problems instead of their regular IT work. This is also true for software vendors who must be able to troubleshoot and assist customers who may have purchased their product. Unlike a corporate help desk, the options for computing devices and Internet connections are endless and remain virtually unknown to the support representative until they get contacted for service. All of this increased demand requires IT support organizations to be more agile in diagnosing and resolving desktop issues, which correlates with how the overall service support processes are run. Organizations that are integrating virtual help desk technology to optimize the overall IT support process are gaining significant benefits. The SSPA (Service & Support Professionals Association) conducts ongoing research to provide help desk organizations with the information to reach their support and service objectives. John Ragsdale, SSPA VP of Research, reports on key benchmark information from the SSPA Benchmark Database, as well as other member and industry surveys to point out trends and best practices in support technology.Ragsdale’s eye on Service: 2007 Service and Support Trends  History  Several things are driving the development of the virtualized help desk. According to IDC, key market factors include the proliferation of remote workers in the enterprise, the expansion of the small and medium-sized business (SMB) and small office/home office (SOHO) market and its increasing dependence on IT, and the need for a cost-effective way to support the consumer market.Worldwide and U.S. Clientless Remote Support Services Tools 2007–2011 Forecast and Analysis; March 2007 As workforces become more dispersed – 83% of companies say they operate a virtual workplace, in which more than one-quarter of employees work away from their supervisors or workgroups – responding to IT issues can be complex and costly if travel is required.Nemertes Issue Paper: Leveraging Convergence for Collaboration Today’s economic instability is also putting added pressure on companies to find gainful ways of optimizing current operations to ensure and build their business. In fact, recent Nemertes research found that only 44% of companies are increasing their IT budgets in 2008; and only 28% plan to do so in 2009. This means that organizations across various industries will be looking for ways to optimize IT.Network World, “The Perfect Storm,” by Robin Gariess Persistent IT problems that prohibit a company’s productivity are another factor as money is lost from both sides of the balance sheet. This concern is amplified when talking about external support as the stakes are higher for companies to deliver swift, effective, and reliable IT support to its customers.

The station is owned by Max Media and licensed to MRR License LLC. It airs a news and talk format. History KZIM was the region's first radio station. The Hirsch Battery and Radio Company, headed by Oscar Hirsch, put KFVS 1340 on air in 1925. In 1928, it moved to 1210 kHz and began sharing the frequency with another station, WEBQ in Harrisburg, Illinois, which also was moved from 1340. KFVS operated with 250 watts during the day and 100 watts at night, moving to full-time 250-watt operation in For special occasions, such as political events, Easter church ceremonies and football games, KFVS received permission to operate simultaneously with WEBQ. In the late 1930s, KFVS sought to go full-time on 1210 if WEBQ was moved to 1310; this was denied. In 1940, KFVS finally broke out of the time share with WEBQ and moved to 1370 kHz. It was not there long before NARBA reallocation resulted in yet another frequency change, to 1400 kHz. In 1947, KFVS moved one last time to its present frequency of 960 kHz, accompanied by a power increase to 500 watts at night and 1,000 watts during the day. This move enabled the 1400 frequency to be reused for a new station in Sikeston, KSIM, the current simulcast partner of KZIM. Hirsch held a minority stake in KSIM until 1961, when he divested it as a condition of KFVS going to 5,000-watt operation on 960. KFVS also expanded to television when KFVS-TV went on the air in 1954. The KFVS callsign was retired from radio on June 1, 1979, when the station became KGIR as a result of Hirsch selling the television station. Six years later, the Hirsch family sold the station after sixty years of ownership, with the Zimmer family acquiring it and renaming the station KZIM. In December 2003, Mississippi River Radio, acting as Max Media LLC (John Trinder, president/COO), reached an agreement to purchase WCIL, WCIL-FM, WUEZ, WXLT, WOOZ-FM, WJPF, KGIR, KZIM, KEZS-FM, KCGQ-FM, KMAL, KLSC, KWOC, KJEZ, KKLR-FM, KGKS, and KSIM from the Zimmer Radio Group (James L.

Career Jencks graduated from Harvard College in 1947 with a degree in English, and earned a Doctor of Medicine from Harvard University in 1951. He interned at the Peter Bent Brigham hospital. Jencks conducted his first postdoctoral research for two years with Fritz Lipmann at Harvard Medical School. Jencks was drafted into the Army Medical Corps and was assigned to the Army Medical Service Graduate School at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, DC. He worked with E. L. Durrum and served as the chair of the department of pharmacology. In 1956–1957, he did a second Public Health Service postdoc with R. B. Woodward of the Harvard University Department of Chemistry. In 1957, he moved to the new graduate program in biochemistry at Brandeis University. He became professor emeritus in 1996. Much of his career focused on reaction mechanisms used by enzyme catalysts. He was particularly well known for studies of the reaction of nucleophiles with carbon. He proposed that enzymes use ground state destabilization, termed the Circe Effect, to increase the reactivity of their bound substrates. Many of these research interests were explored in his influential text Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. Jencks published close to 400 scientific papers during his career. Jencks was a co-founder of the biannual Winter Enzyme Mechanisms Conference. He was memorialized at the 20th Enzyme Mechanisms Meeting in St. Pete Beach, Florida, several days after his death.

The area's vertical drop is 488 m (1600') with a summit elevation of 1189 m (3900'), with one surface lift and one double chair. Annual snowfall at the summit is 1200 cm (475 inches). Shames Mountain, the ‘little ski area that rocks’, tucked away near Terrace and Prince Rupert, BC, was put up for sale in 2008. In an effort to rally a large group of shareholders (aka skiers) to purchase, own and operate Shames Mountain, members of the international ski community Jamie Schectman and Shanie Matthews formed the Shames Mountain Co-op in 2009. Another group called Friends of Shames, composed of local skiers and winter sports enthusiasts, also began to hold town hall meetings in the fall of 2009 in order to get a sense of what the surrounding communities wanted from their ski hill. They opened lines of communication with the former owners of Shames and held meetings with lawyers and consultants specializing in alternative business models. Through these consultations, the best model for Shames' future success was determined to be a non-profit co-operative. In 2010, Friends of Shames applied for and were awarded grant monies for feasibility studies and the development of a business plan. With these in hand, Friends of Shames officially launched the drive to create My Mountain Co-op in February 2011. Individuals, local businesses and corporations bought memberships and worked together to raise awareness within the region about the general benefits of running the ski area as a community service co-op (as opposed to having it close down for lack of a private buyer). Through fundraising efforts, membership shares, and corporate donations, MMC was able to enter a purchase agreement with the former owners - Shames Mountain Ski Corporation (SMSC), and began operating Shames for the first time for the 2011-2012 season. Late in 2012, tenure of the ski area was officially transferred from the provincial government to MMC, removing the last condition of the purchase agreement with SMSC. As of January 2013 MMC (and its membership) achieved the remarkable milestone of owning the Shames Mountain Ski Area.

In Southern California, this volcanic arc would develop throughout the Mesozoic Era to become the geologic regions known as the Sierra Nevada Batholith, the Peninsular Ranges Batholith, (in the Peninsular Ranges), and other plutonic and volcanic centers throughout the greater Mojave Desert region. Douglas M. Morton, Fred K. Miller, Peninsular Ranges Batholith, Baja and Southern California, Geological Society of America, 2014 Geology Plate convergence along the continental margin produced a volcanic arc system throughout the Sierra Nevada and Mojave region roughly 250 million to about 60 million years ago. These massive belts of plutonic (intrusive) and volcanic (extrusive) regional belts and isolated centers developed as plate convergence and subduction took place farther west along the western continental margin. These igneous provinces shed vast quantities of sediment both eastward into the Western Interior Seaway and westward into Pacific margin basin. At the same time, older sedimentary materials and rocks were subjected to regional metamorphism throughout much of Baja and Southern California. In the region today, granitic rocks of Mesozoic age dominate the bedrock exposed in the Peninsular Ranges, western Transverse Range, the southern Sierra Nevada, and the greater Mojave region. Although igneous activity in the Southern California region was ongoing throughout the Mesozoic Era, the peak of the plutonism in the southern Sierra Nevada region was in the Late Cretaceous, about 100 to 80 million years ago. In addition, thick sequences (accumulations) of Mesozoic-age sedimentary rocks, mostly marine shales and sandstone of Jurassic and Cretaceous age, are locally preserved along the western side of the Peninsular Ranges and throughout the western Transverse Ranges in parts of the Santa Monica Mountains and mountainous Los Padres National Forest region north of Santa Barbara, California. A thick sequence of terrestrial sedimentary rocks are also preserved in the McCoy Mountains region near Blythe, California. Except for the sedimentary rocks mentioned above, most of the Mesozoic-age rocks in preserved in Southern California display intermediate to high grades of metamorphism, typical of material that may have been buried to mid-crustal depths (probably in a range of 10 to 20 kilometers). Although the region was no doubt extensively covered with terrestrial and marine sedimentary deposits that interfingered volcanic deposits from the volcanic centers, most of this material was stripped away by erosion following regional uplift that continued into the following Cenozoic Era.

The Metropolitan Cathedral is listed in the National Register of Historic Monuments. Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Judeţul Iaşi , p.111 History Two churches previously stood on the site: the White Church (15th century) and the Presentation Church (17th century). On 8 August 1826, prince Ioan Sturdza signed a decree ordering construction of the cathedral; Metropolitan Veniamin Costache laid the cornerstone on 3 July 1833 and guided construction in its early years. Work began in 1833, using a neo-classical design by Viennese architects Gustav Freywald and Bucher, and continued at a rapid pace until 1841, in the latter years under the Russian architect Mihail Singurov. In 1839, after it was completely built and covered, serious cracks had appeared on the large central arch. Various solutions were attempted (in 1840 Singurov replaced the brick ceiling with wood, for example), but on 23 May 1857, the ceiling collapsed taking the interior columns with it, and the building remained ruined for decades.\\"Catedrala Mitropolitană din Iași\\", Metropolis of Moldavia and BukovinaMetropolitan Cathedral at monumenteiasi.ro At the urging of Metropolitan Iosif Naniescu (1875-1902), the newly independent Romanian state decided to start the restoration work of the cathedral. \\"Monumentele de suflet ale Iașului: statuia lui Ștefan și Catedrala Mitropolitană\\" A new cornerstone was laid on 15 April 1880. Architect Alexandru Orăscu, rector of the University of Bucharest, designed new plans that added two rows of massive pilasters to the interior, creating a rectangular basilica shape, with a central nave and two smaller side naves. The four detached side spires were kept, but the large central dome was eliminated and replaced with a system of four semicircular sections, separated by transverse arches. The cathedral was consecrated on 23 April 1887, in the presence of King Carol I and Queen Elisabeth, who had donated large sums for the project. In 1889, the relics of Saint Parascheva, patron saint of Moldavia, were brought from Trei Ierarhi Monastery and continue to attract crowds of pilgrims, particularly on her feast day (October 14). These are located on the right side of the vestibule, as are those of Veniamin Costache. Architecture Standing in the centre of the Metropolitan Complex, the Great Cathedral is a monumental building of a rectangular plan with four detached towers at its corners that originally flanked an immense dome. The cathedral is long and wide, and with a height of the towers of , it is one of the tallest historical buildings in Moldavia.The architecture The exterior of the Cathedral, as well as the interior, is decorated in the Baroque style. The eastern façade has a central motif formed of six Corinthian columns erected on a stone socle, which support the architrave, above which is a high bas-relief of the Presentation of the Lord. The western façade has eight columns separated by the entrance, above which there is a recessed balcony whose vault has a curved mosaic also showing the Presentation; above that is a stone carving of Saint George. The roof is decorated with zinc fleurons and stylized crosses adorn both the roof and the four spires.\\"Obiectiv turistic\\" Gheorghe Tattarescu painted the icons and decorative elements in a style that respected Orthodox norms but also showed a Renaissance influence. The four Biblical scenes above the central nave, the saints' faces and the decorative compositions all show an Italian neo- classical rigor, to which the artist had been exposed during his studies at Rome's Accademia di San Luca. This creates harmony between the painting and the architectural style.

Biography Friedrich Rathgen was born in Eckernförde, Schleswig-Holstein, on 2 June 1862. He began his formal education at the University of Göttingen in 1881 where he studied the natural sciences. After a brief period of study in Berlin, Rathgen completed his education at the University of Marburg where he received his doctoral degree in organic chemistry in 1886 (Rathgen 1886). The following year Rathgen served as a research assistant to the German chemist, H. H. Landholt, in Berlin where he worked on various aspects of sugar polarization. In 1888 Rathgen was appointed the first Director of the newly formed Chemical Laboratory of the Royal Museums of Berlin where he remained until his retirement in 1927 Friedrich Rathgen is significant in the early development of art conservation, particularly for archaeological conservation. Firstly he was the first chemist to be employed by a museum, the Koniglichen Museen, Berlin (Royal Museums of Berlin), in 1888. This was an event important thatenough for Chris Caple (2000 P.53) Caple, Chris. 2000. Conservation Skills: Judgement, Method and Decision Making. Routledge. London. to write: \\"It was, perhaps, only in 1888 that conservation as a profession discipline can truly be seen to have started\\". This helped in establishing the birth of conservation science. His second major contribution was to publish a Handbook of Conservation. \\"In 1898 Rathgen published the first edition of his handbook Die Konservierung von Altertumsfunden (The Conservation of Antiquities) (Rathgen, 1898). This was the first comprehensive treatment of the subject; it drew upon his ten years of experience and practical work in the field\\". It was translated into English in 1905 (Rathgen 1905). Prior to this there had been several short works, including works by Rathgen, published about conservation, but nothing devoted purely to the subject. Rathgen's handbook was divided into two parts, a format which was adhered to in all subsequent editions: * Part I was devoted to the transformations which antiquities undergo before and after excavation. * Part II discussed the treatment of antiquities, with examples of methods used in various European museums, e.g. at the Royal Museums of Berlin. Many of the methods employed today for the treatment of archaeological materials may be found here in one form or another although Rathgen is rarely cited as a source of reference. Legacy The Rathgen Research Laboratory, bearing Rathgen's name, carries forward the tradition of the old Chemical Laboratory of the Royal Museums in Berlin and is today the world's oldest scientific museum laboratory. It has become a leading institution for conservation science, art technology and archaeometry. The Laboratory carries out investigations on a broad variety of materials within the museum environment and conducts research on the preservation of monuments and archaeological sites.

Developed over a period of years between 1883 and 1967, the complex was home to one of Pittsfield's major paper concerns, and a significant local employer. Now converted to mixed residential and light industrial use, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The former Eaton factory complex is a series of connected brick buildings, set overlooking a bend in the Housatonic River southwest of downtown Pittsfield. The property is bounded on the north by railroad tracks, and was historically bounded on the east and south by a worker housing area; the latter has largely been obliterated by urban renewal activities. There are nine distinct structures in the interconnected complex, ranging in height from three to eight stories. The most prominent and visually distinctive element is the central clocktower, a 3-1/2 story mansard-roofed structure topped by a flagpole and iron cresting. It was built in 1883, and is one of the oldest surviving elements of the complex. The oldest portion of the factory was built in 1883 by the Terry Clock Company, which had its origins in the manufacture of clocks by Eli Terry in 1793. That company and its successors owned the facility until 1893, when it was purchased by the Hurlbut Paper Company, which founded a stationery division on the premises headed by Arthur W. Eaton. Hurlbut was acquired by the American Writing Paper Company, but did not want to keep the stationery division, which Eaton and other investors purchased. After a major investment by Crane & Co. principals in 1908, the company was renamed Eaton, Crane & Pike, eventually shortened to just Eaton in 1934. The company was successful until the 1950s, when a general decline in letter-writing led to reduced demand for its products. After several changes of ownership, it was finally closed in 1987. The plant was soon afterward converted into a combination of residential and mixed industrial uses.

Its main entrance is flanked by sidelights and topped by an entablature, with a Palladian window in the second floor above. Inside, the second-floor ballroom is noted for arched ceiling. Extending west, and facing Route 57, is a two-story ell that is probably the oldest portion of the building. Extending northward from that ell is another long two-story ell.

He is also later recorded as being an innkeeper. The architecture of the ell is consistent with the idea that it constitutes in large part the house that Brown built. Brown's son Sanford, who took over the property in 1792, was likely responsible for the construction of what is now the main portion of the inn. The inn flourished economically, in part because it was on the main stagecoach route between Hartford, Connecticut and Albany, New York. Although business declined as the expansion of railroads led to a decline in business on the stage routes, the inn was updated around 1885 to a \\"country hotel\\". It was revitalized with the advent of increased automobile traffic in the 1920s, which brought tourists to the area.

It includes properties on Massachusetts Route 57, New Marlborough, Monterey and Southfield Roads. It was the town's civic heart through the late 19th century, and retains character from that period. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history New Marlborough was settled in 1740 by Benjamin Wheeler, who built a house in what is now the village center area that still stands. The village center grew nearby his house, and now includes a village green, church, and a number of 18th and 19th century houses. The village declined in economic importance in the late 19th century, as it was supplanted by other villages in the town better sited for industrial activity. The historic district is centered on the junction of Route 57 with Southfield Road, and extends onto Monterey and New Marlborough Branch Roads. The village green is located north of the junction, with the 1839 Congregational church and the historic tavern on the north side. The district also includes some industrial remains, including those of an 1830s foundry, one of the few instances of industrial activity in the village. Several of the houses are fine examples of Greek Revival architecture. The town's first cemetery is located at the western end of the village, and just to the north of the church are the foundational remains of a short-lived academy, which operated from 1855 to 1885.

Built about 1820, it is one of only two brick houses built in a Federalist-Greek Revival transition style in Richmond. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.  Description and history  The Nichols–Sterner House is located in a rural setting of northern Richmond, on the north side of Swamp Road, a historically major road connecting Pittsfield and West Stockbridge. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a gabled roof and a south-facing facade. The facade is three bays wide, with the main entrance in the right bay, framed by pilasters and topped by a keystoned round-arch transom window. The gable above is fully pedimented, with a keystoned half-round window at its center. A contemporaneous 1-1/2 story brick ell extends to the right from the rear corner. The interior retains original Federal woodwork, including fireplace mantels, doors, and trim. The main hall's trim has been given a marbleized finish, and its walls are painted with scenes of the Erie Canal. This artwork is the work of Albert Sterner, the second occupant of the house. The house was built in 1820 and occupied for over 100 years by the local Nichols family. In 1925, the house was sold to Flora Lash Sterner, wife of artist and illustrator Albert Sterner. The Sterners used the house as a summer residence until Albert's death in 1946. Mrs. Sterner did not use the house thereafter, and it suffered from the neglect. She sold the house in 1981, and the new owners undertook steps to restore the property.

It is the oldest mill complex in North Adams that has not had its exterior significantly altered, making visible much of its Italianate styling. In 1831 the land, owned by Luke Brown, had been purchased for $520 by William E. and Thomas A. Brayton, and in 1832 a stone mill 40 x 74 feet, three stories high, with an attic was constructed. Larger print cloths, 52 by 52 feet were manufactured on twenty looms under the name of T.A. Brayton & Co.. The factory village, known as Braytonville, grew around the new mill and was briefly named Deweyville, after Daniel Dewey, in 1863 and until his retirement in 1868. The Norad Mill was built in 1863 by Sanford Blackinton, one of North Adams' leading mill owners, and Daniel Dewey, the prime mover in forming the North Adams Woolen Company. Blackinton used the mill to produce woolen goods that were in high demand during the American Civil War. The business was reorganized as the North Adams Manufacturing Company in 1878, with H.G.B.Fisher taking over as President and E.B. Penniman as Treasurer and Agent. At that time the works had fifty looms, employing 275 hands and turned out 20,000 yards of six-quarter fancy cassimeres per month. The mill continued to be the site of woolen textile production, under a variety of corporate names, until 1947. In 1954 the Excelsior Printing Company began operations in the facility; it was acquired by Crane & Co., which (as of the 1985 National Register nomination), continued to operate that business under its original name. In 2005 the business and mill complex were purchased by Crane family member David Crane. In 2016 the printing business was sold to Integrity Graphics which has consolidated operations elsewhere. The mill complex includes, in addition to the main mill building, several 19th century extensions and a storehouse erected in 1904. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The mill is located one mile west of downtown North Adams, on the north bank of the Hoosic River at the northeast corner of Roberts Drive and the Mohawk Trail (Massachusetts Route 2). The main mill building is a three-story brick structure, to which a number of smaller additions have been made. The largest scale addition to the building was an 1898 enlargement of the main structure, which maintained the roofline of the original 1863 building, while using more modern curtain wall construction methods. The building has been purchased and partly renovated by commercial landlord Moresi and Associates. New tenants as of 2018 include a yarn company, a wine tasting room and a coffee roastery.

North Becket Village did not begin growth until the 1820s, when a sawmill was established. Then in 1841 the Western Railroad was completed along the West Branch Westfield River, and North Becket developed rapidly as an economic center. The brooks feeding the Westfield River became a source of water power for a variety of industries, which distributed their goods to market via the railroad. Over a twenty-year period, many of the towns public institutions moved to the village, and a cluster of Greek Revival residences were built on the west side of Main and High Streets. Most of the village's industries and commercial buildings were wiped out by a flood caused by the breach of a dam on Yokum Brook in 1927, in many cases leaving only foundational remnants.

The district encompasses some along these and other roadways near their junction. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history Egremont was settled in the mid-18th century, in a basically dispersed rural agricultural pattern. The village of North Egremont began to take shape after a turnpike (now Prospect Lake Road) was built between Hillsdale, New York and Alford, Massachusetts, and another (now Route 71) was built between South Egremont and Kinderhook, New York in 1803. A tavern was built in the area in 1790, and it was served by saw and grist mills on nearby Prospect Lake. A general store opened in 1814; it is still in operation as the Old Egremont Country Store. The oldest property in the area, a house, has elements dating to 1764, and the district includes three historic church buildings, the oldest being a significantly altered Baptist meetinghouse from 1816. The later churches are an 1887 Baptist church, built as a replacement for the first one, and a Methodist church built in the Renaissance Revival style in 1861.

The film then cuts to protagonist Romano (Robin Padilla), a retired military operative who goes into seclusion after being seriously wounded in battle and almost died, discovers that he has the uncanny ability of seeing ghosts around people who will soon encounter sudden, disastrous deaths. Worried of his brother, Romano’s blind sister Isabel (Rhian Ramos) persuades him to return to Manila with the help of Louella (Sunshine Dizon), Romano’s childhood friend who is a doctor and harbors affection for him. An aspiring actress, Kristina (Katrina Halili), a widow, Lumen (Glydel Mercado), and her nephew, Eric (Hero Angeles) hitch a ride with Romano, Isabel and Louella along with Louella’s driver, Baste (Mark Bautista). On their van's way back to the city, the group manages to avoid a fatal accident on the road as Romano woke up just in time to warn Baste - having just dreamt of the impending tragedy. As he steps out of the van to survey the scene, he started seeing ghosts surrounding the van and eventually looking at him. The ghosts are an old man, a young woman with hair covering her face, two more adult men, and a woman who Romano thinks look like his mother. He also hears a baby crying though he is unable to see it. After this, the group stopped to eat dinner and rest in a small eatery in Baguio. Just as Lumen mentioned that she needs to use the ladies room, one of the adult male ghosts showed himself to Romano and interacted with him. Soon after, Lumen died as a rail spike pins her head. The next tragic event happened as Eric died of electrocution while attending Lumen's husband's wake, right after the other adult male ghost grabbed Romano to get his attention. The group now consulted with a local elder who informs them that Romano can see ghosts because of an open third eye. Moreover, the ghosts that he sees are \\"Sundo\\" - or those who the grim reaper uses to fetch a person who is about to die. The Sundo can be anyone such as a spouse, siblings, parents, or a friend - anyone who has previously died and has a close relationship with the person. Because Romano prevented the earlier road accident from happening when they are \\"meant\\" to die, they still \\"owe\\" the grim reaper their lives and this debt will be collected no matter what. After leaving the local elder, the group discussed that there are 7 people in the van but Romano only saw 5 ghosts. Romano is unsure whether the ghost of their mom is his or his sister Isabel's Sundo. Baste and Kristina also died right after their Sundo show themselves to Romano. Baste's Sundo is the old man who turned out to be his grandfather who raised him. Kristina's Sundo is the young woman with hair covering her face who is a twin sister that she is not aware exists. After these deaths, Romano, Isabel and Louella decided to stay in Louella's apartment and spend the night. Louella, feeling emotional and scared, finally confessed to Romano that the remaining mysterious ghost - a crying baby - is her Sundo. She got pregnant while in medical school, felt that she was not ready to be a mother and had an abortion. Later on, Romano was lured to the balcony by Isabel as his Sundo. As he realizes that his sister is already dead, the grim reaper pushed him over the balcony. Romano lands into the pool and regains consciousness. As he ascends from the pool he saw a distraught Louella crying. She tells him that he can't be her Sundo, as she already repaid the grim reaper with a life - that is Isabel's life and not her own. She insists that she cheated death by doing so and he can't fetch her. Romano realizes that Louella killed his sister and a flashback of Louella smothering a sleeping Isabel with a pillow is shown. Louella continued to plead to Romano and look visibly scared. Romano then looked at the pool and saw his dead floating body. It turned out that he has died in the water and is now Louella's Sundo.

His grandfather, the diarist John Evelyn, influenced his independent attitude in politics and stimulated his dedication to literature. His public offices included Postmaster-general from 1708 to 1715. Early life Evelyn was born on 1 March 1682 at Sayes Court in Deptford, Kent, the second but only surviving son of John Evelyn the Younger, barrister of the Middle Temple and Commissioner of the Revenue, and his wife, Martha Spencer, daughter and co-heir of Richard Spencer. He was baptised the following day.Cokayne, George Edward (1906) Complete Baronetage. Volume V. Exeter: W. Pollard & Co. . p. 17 He was educated at the French school at Greenwich in 1689, at Kings Street under Mr Arbuthnot in 1691 and at Eton College from 1692 to 1698. He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 25 February 1699, aged 16. His father died in 1699, leaving him heir apparent to the Wotton estate. Career Wotton House, Surrey Evelyn came under the patronage of Sidney Godolphin, Lord Treasurer, a close family friend who helped him to government places. He was appointed Receiver of stamp duties in 1703, and Commissioner for prizes in 1705. He married Godolphin's niece on 18 September 1705, at Lambeth. She was Anne Boscowen, eldest daughter of Edward Boscawen of Cornwall and his wife Jael Godolphin, the daughter of Sir Francis Godolphin. Evelyn succeeded his grandfather, the diarist John Evelyn, to Wotton on 27 February 1706. In August 1708 he surrendered his two government places when he was appointed joint Postmaster General which he held until 1715. Evelyn had been advised by his grandfather, that if he sought electoral success, to do so 'without affectation and vainglory .. or the being carried away by a faction or to serve a party'. His politics were therefore difficult to pin down. In 1705, he led his family's tenants to vote for the Tory in protest against the corruption of the Whig financier Sir William Scawen. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Helston which was dominated by his Whig patron Godolphin, at a by election on 15 December 1708. He supported the Whigs over the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709, and then voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He did not stand at the 1710 British general election but managed to keep his office under the new ministry. He tended to show local support for the Tories. On 6 August 1713, he was created a baronet of Wotton in the County of Surrey in the Baronetage of Great Britain. After the Whig Administration came to power in 1715 he lost his place at the Post Office within a few months. In December 1717 he stood for Parliament again at a by-election for Surrey, but was unsuccessful against the Onslow interest. In 1721 he regained ministerial favour from Walpole and was appointed Commissioner of Customs, which he held until 1763. Evelyn dedicated much of his time to improving the Wootton estate and to scholarly studies. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January 1723. At Wootton House, he built a private library, 45 feet long, to house the collection of books accumulated over three generations. Death and legacy Evelyn and his wife had six sons of whom three survived and three daughter of whom two survived. His wife died, aged 67, in 1752 and was buried at Wotton on 24 January 1752. Evelyn died on 15 or 18 July 1763, and was buried at Wotton on 22 July. He was succeeded by his eldest son, John. His son William was also MP for Helston and raised a monument to his parents.

Built in 1898, it is one of the most architecturally elaborate school buildings in the city. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is now residential housing. Description and history Pittsfield's Old Central High School is located northeast of the city center, on the east side of the old town common. It is a U-shaped 3-1/2 story masonry structure, finished primarily in cream-colored brick, with marble trim and terra cotta detailing. It has a hipped roof pierced by dormers, and is set on a high sandstone foundation. Its centered entrance is flanked by Corinthian columns and topped by a full entablature with balustrade. The interior design echoes the color schemes of the exterior. The land on which the school stands was originally part of Pittsfield's first cemetery, whose graves were relocated to the Pittsfield Cemetery on Wahconah Street between 1850 and 1872. When the city's previous high school burned down in 1895, the city held a design competition for its replacement. Of 130 designs submitted, the city selected one by the New York City firm of Pierce & Brun. It was completed in 1898 at a cost of $200,000, well over the $135,000 it had been estimated to cost. A new high school was built in 1931, after which this building became a junior high school. It sat vacant from 1953 to 1959, and in 1961 became the first home of Berkshire Community College. It has since been converted to residences.

It is historically significant as the site of the first wood-based newsprint paper mill in the United States, and has a well- preserved collection of late 18th and early 19th-century architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The area now known as Interlaken,http://www.sblanchard.us/Interlaken/index.htm is located in northern Stockbridge, between Stockbridge Bowl (originally Lake Mahkeenac) and Lake Averic (also known as Echo Lake), which is the town of Stockbridge's water supply. Massachusetts Route 183 transects the community north to south. The road roughly parallels Larrywaug Brook, the outflow of Stockbridge Bowl. In the 18th century, this section of brook was developed industrially, and by the 1820s had at least seven mills, a foundry, distillery, and a thriving village center. The village was bypassed by the railroad, which ultimately led to the failure of many of these enterprises. It saw a brief resurgence in its economy after the American Civil War, when the Pagenstacher Paper Mill, the nation's first wood-pulp paper mill, operated here. Like the earlier business, it eventually left the village due to the poor transit situation. Around the turn of the 20th century the village began to be seen as part of the Berkshire's summer resort area. Its post office was renamed from Curtisville to Interlaken in 1902. The historic district is roughly triangular in shape, its main axes on Interlaken Road (Route 183), Train Hill Road, and Avery Road. It is about in size, with 53 historically significant buildings, and the ruins of upward of twenty water-based mills. Among ts noteworthy historic buildings are the Interlaken Congregational Church (1824), the Citizens Hall (1870), and the Bancroft-Curtisville Hotel, once the location of the St. Helen's Home. The church and hotel are now private residences and the hall is the site of the IS 183 Art School of the Berkshires. St. Helen's Home was sponsored by the New York Tribune's Fresh Air Fund in the opening decades of the twentieth century. The Fund enabled children from some of New York City's poorest neighborhoods to experience several weeks of summer respite in rural locations in upstate New York and New England.

Description and history The Osborn House was located down a long, wooded (and now abandoned) drive on the east side of West Road in Mount Washington, just to the east of a more modern, abandoned house. It was a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a side gable roof, clapboard siding, and a central chimney. Its exterior was devoid of significant stylistic elements. The interior had mainly 20th-century finishes, although the building's post and beam structure was visible. Its original two fireplaces had been replaced by a single one. The property includes an unmaintained orchard with trees estimated to be over 150 years old, and the Osborn family cemetery, located near West Street. The house was probably built not long after Benjamin Osborn bought a large tract of land here in 1759. Shaker founder Mother Ann Lee stayed at the farmhouse during her May 1781 missionary journey to Tucconack Mountain (renamed Mount Washington, following the American victory in the American Revolutionary War).

The district is centered on the historic heart of Pittsfield encompassing a number city blocks adjacent to Park Square, which is at the junction of North, South, East, and West Streets. When first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, the district encompassed the park and eight buildings that faced it, including the Old Town Hall, the county courthouse, the Berkshire Athenaeum, and the First Church of Christ. In December 1991, the boundaries were expanded to the area roughly bounded by East Housatonic, South, North and Fenn Streets, and Wendell Avenue, adding 39 buildings to the district. Notable buildings included in this extension include the present City Hall (a repurposed post office building), the Berkshire Life Insurance Company Building, the Allen Hotel, the Berkshire Museum of Art and Natural History, and the Masonic temple. Park Square Pittsfield was settled in the 1740s, and was incorporated as a proprietary settlement in 1753. It was given a town charter in 1761. Park Square, the heart of the city, was laid out in 1790 on land donated by John Chandler Williams. It was located near the town's first colonial meeting house, which was erected in 1762. The square was the site of the nation's first agricultural fair, held in 1810. In the first half of the 19th century, the community began to develop industrially, principally in the area of paper manufacturing. It became a regionally important hub due to its railroad connections in the mid-19th century, and became the shire town of Berkshire County in 1868, spurring further growth. The commercial districts around the square developed in the late 19th century as a result of this growth.

A bon vivant, sailor, and sportsman, he was the son of yeast magnate Charles Louis Fleischmann.  Biography  Fleischmann was born in Cincinnati to Austria-born Hungarian Charles Louis Fleischmann and his Prussian-born wife Henriette Robertson.Beresford, Hattie. \\"MOGULS & MANSIONS : MAJOR MAX C. FLEISCHMANN,\\" Montecito Journal vol. 2, No. 2 (Winter/Spring 2009/2010). Retrieved January 15, 2015. Julius left college to become general manager of Fleischmann's Yeast in 1894 when he was 22 years old. He became president of the company in 1897, overseeing the company's expansion. Among the many interests of the Fleischmann family was major league baseball. In 1898, Fleischman financed the semiprofessional baseball team, the Cincinnati Shamrocks, which included the future Hall of Fame manager Miller Huggins. In 1900, Huggins played for Fleischmann's semiprofessional team based in the Catskill Mountains, the Mountain Tourists. Julius Fleischmann was also involved in thoroughbred horses, along with his father and his brother Max, under the name Charles Fleischmann and Sons. He became Cincinnati's youngest mayor in 1900 aged 28. He was re-elected once, and served until 1905. Under his mayorship, Cincinnati's police force became known as one of the best in the nation. As mayor, Fleischmann promoted education, created public parks, and supported continued investment in local railroad lines. A staunch Republican, Fleischmann later served three times as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. In May 1914, Fleischmann gave Fleischmanns Park to the village of Fleischmanns, New York. The park, which dominated the north side of Wagner Avenue in Fleischmanns, was formerly known as the Mountain Athletic Club. It was where the town's semiprofessional baseball players came to get in shape before the start of the regular season. (One of the town's players was the future Hall of Famer Honus Wagner.) Stipulations of Julius' gift were that it always be used as a park and athletic grounds, that it always be kept in good condition, that it never be sold or sublet, and always be of free access to the public. Fleischmann was initiated as a national honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity in 1914. He died of heart disease on February 5, 1925, while playing polo in Miami.

Some portions of the mill show signs of Greek Revival architecture, which was no longer in fashion in the 1850s. Many histories give the mills construction date as 1864, because that is the date it was converted to for use as a woolen mill. Benjamin F.

The passenger station is a single story brick building with a shallow hip roof with very deep eaves that are supported by large brackets. Its doors and windows are all round-arched. The baggage house is a more utilitarian wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The Pittsfield and North Adams Railroad inaugurated service through Adams in 1845-46. The present buildings were built by that railroad between 1889 and 1894. The railroad was eventually folded into the Boston and Albany Railroad, which continued operations through the mid-20th century. The New York Central Railroad leased the B&A; lines and it operated the Berkshire Hills Express and other trains between North Adams and New York City through Adams. The passenger depot has been adaptively reused as a commercial space. The tracks have been removed; the space previously occupied by track has been paved and converted into a pedestrian walk.

The Colonial Revival building was constructed in 1926, and was the first Roman Catholic hospital in Berkshire County. St. Luke's merged with Pittsfield General Hospital in 1967 to form Berkshire Medical Center, in the nation's first mergers between religious and non-sectarian hospitals. The building was converted into elderly housing in 1978-1981. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history Providence Court is located on the north side of East Street (Massachusetts Route 9), several blocks east of Pittsfield's central business district. It is a five- story brick and stone structure, in a T shape with a horizontal block at the front and a long projecting wing to the rear of the center. It is basically Colonial/Georgian Revival in character, with limestone trim that includes corner quoining, window sills and keystones, and belt courses. The ground floor, essentially a raised basement, is finished in rusticated limestone, while the upper floors are predominantly in brick. The main entrance, set between the first and second levels, is sheltered by a limestone portico with Tuscan columns. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield decided in 1916 to establish a hospital in Pittsfield, and dedicated a facility in two converted residences the following year. This space proving inadequate, the diocese purchased the Allen estate on East Street, and converted the estate house into a maternity ward. The present building was constructed on the grounds of the former Allen estate between 1923 and 1926, to design by ecclesiastical architect Jonathan William Donohue of Springfield. It was operated as St. Luke's Hospital until 1967, when it was merged with Pittsfield General Hospital to form what is now known as Berkshire Medical Center. The Pittsfield General facility was enlarged in 1976, and this building was closed. It was purchased by the local housing authority in 1978, and has been converted into elderly housing.

It is basically cruciform in shape, with a square tower project to the side of the street-facing gable end. The sides of the nave are reinforced by buttresses, and the tower is capped by a low hip roof with posts at the corners. A three-part stained-glass window is set in the gable end, depicting Saint Andrew in the center with stylized flowers in the flanking windows. The chapel was designed by Pittsfield architect George C. Harding and was completed in 1899. Harding was then in the early stages of his career, which would include a wide variety of public buildings across New England. The church was built for George Crane, a wealthy New Yorker who summered at the adjacent estate. Services were only held in the chapel when the Cranes were in residence, and ownership of the chapel and Crane's estate eventually passed to the Episcopal diocese.

The industrial history of the site dates to 1763 when the first grist and sawmills were built. In 1829, the first stone furnace was constructed for the production of iron from abundant hematite ore found nearby. It was rebuilt in 1863, and overhauled in 1905 to increase capacity. The area saw industrial iron production until 1923.RIW Historic Registration - Press Releases, 1999 The historic district also includes several other houses and buildings related to the iron works. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description The Richmond Furnace district is located in southern Richmond, in an area that is now almost entirely rural in character. It covers an area about in size, that is roughly L-shaped. The vertical part of the L is organized around Furnace Brook, which flows roughly south on the east side of Massachusetts Route 43. Industrial remnants are found mainly on the east side of the brook, between Furnace Pond (whose dam is crossed by Pilgrim Road) and areas south of Furnace Road. The main furnace is located on private land between Furnace Lane, now a short spur with a few houses on it, and the brook. The base of the L extends further east from this area, including a few more houses and industrial remains, the most prominent a water-filled quarry on the north side of Furnace Road. The eastern extent of the district is on Cone Hill Road, where some industry-related housing stands, as does the Cone Hill Cemetery, where individuals associated with the works are buried. Surviving elements of worker and management housing are found on most of the named roads, with a cluster located on Route 43 near Pilgrim Road. Site history In 1829, brothers John H., Charles and George Coffing established the Richmond Iron Works on the site. The Coffings has previously worked at the Salisbury Iron Works in nearby Connecticut. In 1834, a second furnace, 32 feet high x 9.5 feet wide was built at Van Deusenville, in nearby Great Barrington.

A raceway running parallel to the railroad tracks channeled water from the river to power the mills. The mill complex had 25 buildings, ranging in construction dates from 1867 to the 20th century. Most were of brick construction, ranging in height from one to three stories. The main mill building was a three-story building, with an Italianate tower near the center of its western facade. The office, located north of the main structure, was a two-story brick building with Victorian Gothic features. The Renfrew Company was founded in 1867 by local businessmen who were previously engaged in either the textile business or paper manufacturing. The company acquired a large parcel of land, which straddled Columbia Street south of Lime Street. On this they built two mills (neither now standing) and tracts of mill worker housing (some of which survives). The company at first manufactured cotton gingham fabric.

It is a historic district that includes six re-purposed farm buildings related to the former 'Shadowbrook' mansion destroyed by fire in 1956. Designed by architect H. Neill Wilson with landscaping by Frederick Law Olmsted, the mansion and farm buildings were built for Anson Phelps Stokes in 1893. Andrew Carnegie acquired Shadowbrook in 1917 and died there in 1919. It served as a Jesuit novitiate from 1922 until 1970. Following the fire, a non-equivalent structure of the same name took its place. Today the historic district primarily encompasses Berkshire Country Day School, which acquired its campus from the Stokes family in 1963.http://berkshirecountryday.org/about- bcd/history/ The historic district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. History Nathaniel Hawthorne originated the name \\"Shadow Brook\\" in reference to a small stream that lies to the west and south of the mansion site. Samuel Gray Ward in 1844 purchased land on the slopes of Baldhead and built a mansion near the site of what was to become Shadowbrook. Ward named his mansion Oakwood.Houses of the Berkshires Richard S. Jackson and Cornelia Brooke Gilder Acanthus Press 2011, pp. 44–49. left Stokes bought the property in 1892 along with additional land to the south and north, assembling an estate of . The Oakwood building was demolished except for its east wing, and Stokes built his mansion on a ledge 100 yards (90 m) west and 30 feet (9 m) lower. The new structure, completed in 1893 at a cost of $500,000, was shaped like the letter 'L' with its point aimed south and comprised two dominant styles involving English Tudor timbering and stone. The vista from the main house included an impressive view to the south of Stockbridge Bowl, West Stockbridge Mountain, Rattlesnake Hill, Monument Mountain and Mount Everett. Various timbered farm buildings were completed as part of the estate in the valley below, where members of the Stokes family continued to live at least until the 1950s. Anson Stokes crushed his leg in a riding accident on the property and, following its amputation, left the mansion for Darien, Connecticut, in 1898. The estate was mostly vacant until 1906, when it was sold to Spencer P. ShotterHouses of the Berkshires, Richard S. Jackson and Cornelia Brooke Gilder Acanthus Press 2011, p 159 of New Orleans, who departed in 1912. The wife of a Vanderbilt family member leased the property briefly in 1916 following her husband's death, and the mansion was sold in 1917 by Potter's debtors to Andrew Carnegie for $300,000. Carnegie had purchased what was regarded at the time to be the second largest private residence in the United States. The estate was among the most prominent examples of the gilded age in the Berkshires. Carnegie died at Shadowbrook in 1919, and the Society of Jesus acquired the property three years later to serve as a novitiate for training Jesuit priests. Fire and later history Shadowbrook's main house was destroyed in a fire on March 9, 1956, that claimed the lives of four of its 150 residents. Two more residents subsequently died of injuries from the incident. Because of the building's high cost for upkeep and other practical difficulties, architectural plans for its replacement had already been made prior to the fire. These designs were criticized by a number of senior Jesuit residents at the time, one of whom described the new building as \\"a monumental mediocrity.\\" The replacement building, west of Shadowbrook's ruins, was completed and in use by 1958 \\"with a nondescript brick and concrete exterior and much painted cinderblock inside\\" according to Shea. An editor's postscript to Shea's work notes that in 1970 the novitiate moved to the Boston area. The building then stood empty until 1983 when it was sold to a Hindu ashram that established the Kripalu Center, a yoga, health and wellness retreat center on the property. In 1956 Francis X. Shea, a priest who had trained at Shadowbrook, wrote an account of the Shadowbrook mansion's history and its destruction which was published posthumously in 2009 by the Society of Jesus.F.X.

It was designated as the country's first national marine sanctuary on January 30, 1975, and is one of only two of the thirteen national marine sanctuaries created to protect a cultural resource rather than a natural resource. The sanctuary comprises a column of water in diameter extending from the ocean’s surface to the seabed around the wreck of the Civil War ironclad, which lies south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Average water depth in the sanctuary is . Since its sinking in 1862, the Monitor has become an artificial reef attracting numerous fish species, including amberjack, black seabass, oyster toadfish and great barracuda. USS Monitor Engraving of the Monitor sinking The Monitor was the prototype for a class of U.S. Civil War ironclad, turreted warships that significantly altered both naval technology and marine architecture in the nineteenth century. Designed by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson, the vessel contained all of the emerging innovations that revolutionized warfare at sea. The Monitor was constructed in a mere 110 days. While the design of Monitor was well-suited for river combat, her low freeboard and heavy turret made her highly unseaworthy in rough waters. This feature probably led to the early loss of the original Monitor, which foundered during a heavy storm. Swamped by high waves while under tow by Rhode Island, she sank on December 30, 1862 in the Atlantic Ocean off Cape Hatteras. Sixteen of 62 crewmen were lost in the storm. Rediscovery In 1973, the wreck of the ironclad Monitor was located on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean by an interdisciplinary team of scientists from Duke University’s Marine Laboratory. The discovery was preceded by extensive historical research and the selection of probable areas for the Monitor’s sinking. The search team located what they believed to be the wreck of the Monitor using side-scan sonar and remotely operated cameras. In 1974, the U.S. Navy and the National Geographic Society launched a second expedition that confirmed the identity of the Monitor and produced detailed photographic documentation of the wreck site. One year later, in 1975, the site was designated as the nation’s first marine sanctuary. Preservation Initial dives in the 1970s and later research expeditions in the early 1990s have indicated that the Monitor’s iron hull, having been inundated with saltwater for over 100 years, is deteriorating at an accelerated rate. In 1998, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) developed a plan to recover significant \\"iconic\\" sections of the wreck for conservation and public display. Additionally, NOAA developed a plan to help stabilize the wreck from further deterioration as much as possible. The warship's propeller was raised to the surface in 1998. On July 16, 2001, divers from the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary and the US Navy brought to the surface the steam engine. Due to the depth of the wreck, the divers utilized surface supplied diving techniques while breathing heliox. In 2002, after 41 days of work, the revolutionary revolving gun turret was recovered by the NOAA and a team of U.S. Navy divers. Before removing the turret, divers discovered the remains of two trapped crew members. The remains of these sailors, who died while on duty, are at the Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, awaiting positive identification. Many artifacts from Monitor, including her turret, propeller, anchor, engine, delicate glass bottles, lumps of coal, wood paneling, a leather book cover and even walnut halves, have been conserved and are on display at the Mariners' Museum of Newport News, Virginia. Once conservation is complete, artifacts are available for exhibition and study. While the majority of the Monitor artifacts remain at The Mariners’ Museum, other facilities including the Richmond National Battlefield Park in Virginia, Civil War Naval Museum in Columbus, Georgia, Nauticus in Norfolk, Virginia, and soon the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum in Hatteras, North Carolina, also display artifacts from the historic ship. In 1986, Monitor was designated a National Historic Landmark. It is one of only three accessible monitor wrecks in the world, the others being the Australian vessel HMVS Cerberus, and the Norwegian KNM Thor, which lies at about off Verdens Ende in Vestfold county, Norway.

The property is notable as the subject of a book by the Andrewses, The Fruits of the Shaker Tree of Life, in which they document the property's condition and restoration. The farmhouse was built c. 1795 by Daniel Hand of New Lebanon, New York, and exhibits a number of examples of Shaker craftsmanship. The Andrewses acquired the property in 1937, and devoted the rest of their lives to collecting, documenting, and promoting Shaker heritage. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. As of 1995, the property continues to be owned by Andrews descendants. Description and history Shaker Farm is located in a rural setting of geographically central Richmond, on the east side of Dublin Road about midway between Sleepy Hollow and Lenox Roads. The property consists of , primarily open fields, although there are trees around the farmstead. The farmstead includes four buildings: a house, barn, shed, and privy. The house is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The rear roof has a lower pitch than the front, giving the house a saltbox profile, although there is architectural evidence it was not always that way. The main facade, which faces south, is three bays wide, with the main entrance at the center. It has a board-and-batten door fastened with wrought iron hinges and latches. The door is not original to the house, but was salvaged from a Shaker house. The interior retains a significant number of original features, such as some wide pine flooring, but these have in part been replaced or augmented by restorative work performed by the Andrewses, often by salvage from other Shaker buildings. The property the house stands on was part of a land grant made in 1762 to Joseph Dwight. After multiple divisions and resales, the 10-acre parcel was sold to Daniel Hand, who built the house soon afterward. It was purchased in 1937 by Edward Deming Andrews and his wife Faith, with the house in extremely deteriorated condition. They spent the next two years undertaking its restoration, a process documented in The Fruits of the Shaker Tree of Life, which has undergone maintenance and some additional stabilization work since then. The barn, built in the early 19th century, was also restored, and a more modern addition was made to it. The Andrewses were influential in the rediscovery and popularization of the aesthetics of Shaker craftsmanship, and Shaker Farm was featured in a number of magazine articles on the subject.

The village extends linearly along United States Route 7, roughly between Maple Avenue and Berkshire School Road, and includes the town's major civic and religious buildings. The area's principal period of development was between 1760 and the 1890s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The town of Sheffield is located in southwestern Massachusetts, just north of the border with Connecticut. Its first area of permanent European settlement, established in 1726, was in the Sheffield Plain area, north of the present center. A village developed there, and at Ashley Falls, several miles to the south. Wanting a more centrally-located meeting house, Sheffield's citizens erected the present Old Parish Church near its current location in 1760. From this beginning, the center gradually grew in importance as the town's principal focus for civic, economic, and religious affairs. The building that serves as town hall was built as a commercial building c. 1825 and acquired by the town in 1878; it is a fine Greek Revival stone structure with marble quoining. Other civic buildings include the library, Dewey Memorial Hall (a community center), the town's first high school, and the old Sheffield Academy building, which was originally in the Plain village. When the Housatonic Railroad was laid through the town in the 1840s, a station was placed in the center; the only surviving elements of this area freight house (still in its original location), and the passenger depot (relocated onto US 7). Most of the housing in the village is 2-1/2 story wood frame construction, in a diversity of 18th to late 19th century architectural styles. Three brick houses from the Georgian (18th century) period are notable for their state of preservation.

The linear district extends southward about from the junction of United States Route 7 and Cook Road, where the original town common is located. The district was primarily developed in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The town of Sheffield is located in southwestern Massachusetts, just north of the border with Connecticut. The Plains district is a particularly fertile intervale on the west side of the Housatonic River, which roughly bisects the town. This area was purchased from the local Mahicans in 1724, and the first settler, Matthew Noble, in about 1726 built the first house in what is now Sheffield roughly where Cook Street at US 7 meet; it survives as an ell to a later house. Development proceed gradually, with the north-south road (now US 7) as the main traffic artery. The town's first meeting house was probably built just west of the training ground (now the roughly triangular park bounded by Cook, US 7, and Old Mill Pond Road) in 1735. The home of Rev. Jonathan Hubbard, the community's first minister, was built in 1740, and still stands as an ell to an 1810 house on US 7. The area saw a second spurt of growth following the establishment of a turnpike in 1801, which generally followed the alignment of US 7. It had all the trappings of a town center, with shops and taverns, and the 1840 Sheffield Academy, a school whose building was later moved to Sheffield Center. The development of a railroad along the Housatonic River valley, however, spelled the end of the Plain's importance, as the train station was located further south. The town's civic and religious focus moved to the Center, and little development has taken place in the district since the late 19th century. The district's focal point is the triangular common at Cook Road and US 7. A linear collection of buildings extends southward on both sides of US 7 from that intersection, meeting more modern development about to the south. All of the buildings are 1-1/2 or 2-1/2 stories in height and of wood frame construction, and are residential or residential-commercial in use. They are all typically vernacular interpretations of Georgian, Federal and Greek Revival styling, sometimes with modest Victorian embellishments that were added later.

It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, two interior chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance framed by sidelight windows and a corniced entablature. Most windows are rectangular sash, topped by projecting cornices, while that above the entrance is a three-part window with narrow sash windows flanking a larger central one. The main roof line has a line of dentil moulding at the cornice. The house has retained most of its architectural work, although its roof was converted from a hip roof to a gable end roof in the 19th century, before being restored to its original form. The house was built about 1798 by John Collar, a regionally prominent builder whose surviving houses are known for their quality workmanship. Thomas Shepard, for whom it was built, was one of four brothers who were early settlers of New Marlborough, arriving by 1768. The Shepards and the Hartwells, its next owner, were both involved in the establishment of the Baptist Church in New Marlborough. It is possible that the Baptists meetings were held in the large chamber on the second floor of this house; the congregation did not build a church until 1847.

The argument for an independent republic is that Siberia makes up 77% of Russian territory (13.1 million square kilometers) and includes 40 million people. Western Siberia has rich oil and gas reserves, but the taxes go directly to Moscow. Getting extraction companies to pay taxes in the regions where they operate would benefit Siberia. The argument against self-determination is that Siberia is sparsely populated and needs the Russian Federation to keep it from falling to foreign invaders. History The idea came about in the mid-19th century and took shape with military activities of Aleksandr Kolchak and Viktor Pepelyayev during the Russian Civil War. In 1918 two provisional governments were formed, one in Vladivostok and another in Omsk. Both governments merged by the end of the year into the Provisional All-Russian Government. In 1922 Siberia became part of the Soviet Union. The idea of an independent Siberian Republic was considered in 1989, during the election of Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union, but they reached a compromise with the Siberian Agreement, which gave more regional power to the local leaders.

Sherman Farm is a historic farmhouse located at 1072 State Road in North Adams, Massachusetts. Built in the 1820s, it is one the city's few surviving 19th-century houses, with relatively few alterations since its elaborate Italianate porch in the 1870s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The William B. Sherman Farm is located in western North Adams, on the south side of State Road (Massachusetts Route 2), near the town line with Williamstown. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, two interior chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. The building corners have broad pilasters, which rise to an entablature that extends beneath fully pedimented gables on the sides. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a single-story porch extending across the front. The porch roof has a cornice adorned with jigsawn brackets, and the spaces between the posts are adorned with large rounded jigsawn woodwork. The ground floor windows under the porch are elongated, and the entry doorway is a French door. The house was built in the 1820s by William Sherman, a Rhode Island native who moved to the area in 1780. Sherman purchased a large tract of land, then part of Williamstown, in 1813. The land transferred to North Adams jurisdiction in 1900, and most of it was sold off for development in the 20th century, leaving the house standing on a small parcel. The Greek Revival house is one of the oldest surviving farmhouses in North Adams, and is visually distinctive for its Italianate porch, the result of an 1870s period of alteration. Sherman sold his house and farm to his son Eber (who built another house nearby) in 1843. The property then went through a succession of owners.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 12, 1986. Description and history The Sibley–Corcoran House is located in eastern Washington, on about at the northwest corner of Summit Hill and Upper Valley Roads. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and central chimney. Its main facade is five bays wide, with its main entrance sheltered by a small enclosed gable-roofed vestibule. The exterior is clad in modern siding, either replacing or obscuring architecturally significant features. The side gables are fully pedimented, a Greek Revival alteration. The secondary entrance, on the south side of the house, also has an enclosed vestibule, and a shed-roofed addition extends to the rear. A 20th-century garage stands off to one side. The house was built c. 1813 by Ezra Sibley, and sold in 1825 to Daniel Sibley, including of land. Daniel Sibley was likely responsible for making the Greek Revival alterations to the house, which included the placement of broad cornerboards, as well as a frieze and entablature below the roof line. In 1869, the house was sold to John Corcoran, an employee of the railroad which passed near the house. The house represents a late entry in the town's development, which was stunted by the poor quality of its land, and came to an effective end in the late 1810s.

Description and history The Simmons Block is located in downtown Adams, on the west side of Park Street just south of the Adams Free Library. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a mostly clapboarded exterior. The structure features a variety of rooflines and a small tower in a typical Queen Anne style, with fine turned woodwork on the porches, and applied woodwork decoration.

Simmons, a successful Adams businessman of the 1880s. Simmons is listed in early city directories as residing here, but the ground floor appears to have been designed from the start to house his funeral parlor as well. It is differentiated from other commercial construction of the period in Adams by its wood frame construction, and its particularly elaborate decorative elements. In the 20th century the building has seen a variety of commercial uses, including as an apartment house.

It is located along Massachusetts Route 23 in the plains east of the Taconic Mountains. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history Egremont was first settled beginning in the late 1730s, and was incorporated in 1761. The south village, located in a plain east of the Taconic Mountains, developed early as an agricultural village, with the waters of Karner Brook providing power for a sawmill in 1780. The village received an economic boost when the state of Massachusetts built a turnpike (now Massachusetts Route 23) through the area in 1801. This helped the village develop as a stopping point for travelers, and encouraged several small industries, most notably the manufacture of shoes and carriage axles, to develop along Karner Brook. In 1832 the Mt. Everett Academy opened in the village as the town's first secondary school; its surviving Greek Revival building is one of the finest of the type in the village, and later also served as the town hall and library. The village was economically stable in the second half of the 19th century, and declined economically in the early 20th century. Its fortunes were revived in the 1930s as a tourist destination by Hugh Smiley, who founded Olde Egremont as a vehicle to preserve the village's mid-19th century streetscape. The historic district extends along Massachusetts Route 23 from its western junction with Massachusetts Route 41 in the west to its junction with the Sheffield-Egremont Road in the east, including a few buildings on adjacent roadways. This street alignment is roughly that of the 1801 turnpike, and is remarkably faithful to its appearance in 1844. On a map produced in that year there were 55 buildings, of which 44 are still standing, with only five subsequent additions to the village. In addition to the academy building, prominent buildings include the Egremont Village Inn (1780; moved 1801 to be closer to the turnpike), the 1832-33 Congregational church, whose horse sheds also survive nearby, and the 1825 South Egremont Store. Of the district's historic industries, only the mill pond, dam and raceway survive at the western end of the village.

Masquerading as a dandy, he is able to speak with her about eternity; surprisingly he succeeds in converting her to Christianity. Yet on their return to the desert he becomes fascinated with her former life. She enters a convent to repent of her sins.

Extending mainly along Massachusetts Route 102 (Pleasant Street) between Fairview Street and the Stockbridge town line, the village is a well-preserved 19th-century mill village, with fine Federal and Greek Revival buildings and a later 19th- century paper mill. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history Henry Billings Brown House The town of Lee was settled in 1760, comparatively later than neighboring towns, and was incorporated in 1777. South Lee was a remote outpost off major roads until the Housatonic River Turnpike was built in 1806 by Col. Joseph Whiton, who had in 1794 built the house now known as the Merrell Tavern. Whiton was a major early economic force in the village, operating a sawmill, forge, and brickyard. Now on a major east-west route, and close to what became a major north-south route (now United States Route 7), the village soon grew as a traveler's stop and civic center. Industry also developed, with one of the first paper mills in the Berkshires opened on the banks of the Housatonic River in 1806, joined later by other industries. The railroad's arrival in 1848 spurred further development, including the construction of a large paper mill by the Hurlbuts in 1872. The historic district extends along Pleasant Street from the Stockbridge town line in the west to Fairview Street in the east, and for a short distance along the latter roadway. This area is hemmed in by the Housatonic River and Bear Mountain in the south, and a relatively steep ridge in the north. Most of the architecture is wood-frame residential, although three early Federal period buildings are of brick, including the Merrell Tavern, the village's oldest surviving building. The most common styles found in the village are Federal and Greek Revival, reflecting the village's period of growth in the first half of the 19th century. Archaeological resources in the district include remnants of some of its 19th century industrial complexes.

Designed by architect H. Neil Wilson, it was built in 1888 when the area north of Park Square developed as a commercial and retail part of downtown Pittsfield. Description and history The building stands in downtown Pittsfield, on the east side of North Street, roughly midway between Fenn and Eagle Streets. It is a four- story steel and masonry structure, built out of Philadelphia pressed red brick with rusticated brownstone trim. It has a central full-height section, seven bays wide, capped by a hip roof, which has flanking three-story mansarded wings. The ground floor has four storefronts, two on either side of the main building entrance, each now redone with modern plate glass display windows flanking recessed entrances. A belt course of sandstone separates the first and second floors, and brick pilasters separate the middle seven bays from the outer ones. Windows are rectangular sash, except for the central fourth-floor windows, where eight are set in round-arch openings. Windows in the outermost two bays on each side have stone sills, and are topped by a course of brickwork that extends across the width of the outer sections. In the central sections, the outer windows are grouped in threes, each individually topped by stone sills. At the time of its construction in 1888, this building was relative rarity for the type of brick used and for its cast iron detailing, which has since been removed. The second floor was the second home for the local YMCA. The architect was H. Neill Wilson, a prominent local architect, and the builder was D.C. Munyan, who was responsible for the construction of a number of other nearby buildings, including the adjacent Academy of Music (burned 1912), the Berkshire County Courthouse, and the Berkshire Athenaeum, both prominent structures on Park Square.

Hoosac Road in Williamstown, Massachusetts.The rail yard was an important junction point for the railroads of the area in the late 19th century, serving as the western terminus for trains passing through the Hoosac Tunnel to points east. The yard's facilities included a locomotive repair shop and a railroad roundhouse, although the latter has not survived. The district was listed the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history The former Williamstown Rail Yard and Station occupy a narrow strip of land along the north bank of the Hoosic River, roughly divided by Cole Avenue, and separated from North Hoosac Road by the railroad right-of-way the facilities historically served. The southeastern half of the district is where the former passenger station is located, while the northwestern half houses a few surviving elements of the railroad maintenance yard. The passenger station was built in 1898 to replace an earlier wood frame station (built 1859) that was destroyed by fire. The new station was built of stone, and features Richardsonian Romanesque details. Passenger service was discontinued by the Boston & Maine Railroad in 1959. The surviving railyard facilities include coal storage elevators, built between 1914 and 1931 for use by local coal delivery services, and the 1879 freight house, at the very northern end of the district. Railroad service to Williamstown was inaugurated in 1859, and was instrumental in transforming the town, bringing industrial development. Early service ran between Pittsfield, Massachusetts and Albany, New York, and this was augmented by the completion of the Hoosac Tunnel to also provide faster service to Boston. The Fitchburg Railroad took over all three lines in 1887, and used this yard as a staging ground for helper locomotives on the traversal of the Hoosac Tunnel, and as a sorting yard to separate eastbound traffic bound either for the tunnel or Pittsfield. The yard had sixteen sidings, a nine-bay roundhouse, and a turntable; the latter two features do not survive in recognizable form, and their site is located outside the historic district. The service features of the yard fell out of use after the Hoosac Tunnel was electrified in 1911. The 1879 freight house was closed in 1939, its functions relocated to the passenger station. Passenger service ended at the end of 1958, and the freight station was closed the following year.

Built beginning in 1744 on of land, it is one of the best-preserved farmsteads of the period in Berkshire County. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. The property is owned by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and is named the Kellogg Conservation Center. Description and history The Westover–Bacon–Potts Farm is located in a rural setting of southeastern Egremont, on roughly bisected by Undermountain Road, bounded on the north by Warner Road and the south by the right-of-way of the Appalachian Trail. The farmstead is located on the west side of the road, with the farmhouse facing east. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The rear roof face extends to the first floor, giving the house a classic saltbox profile. The house is accompanied by several 19th-century farm outbuildings, as well as a 20th-century garage. Land for the farm was purchased in 1744 by Jonah Westover, who built the house that now stands on the property. In the 1790s the property was purchased by Elijah Bacon, in whose family it remained until 1965. In the intervening years little was done to modernize the house. The 1965 purchasers, the Goldricks, were antique dealers with connections in the historic preservation community, and made some modernization of the property, sensitive to its historic integrity. Later owners have continued the practice of sensitive updating to the house, which remains one of the best-preserved 2 1/2 story houses in Egremont. Mary- Margaret Kellogg in 2004 donated her home \\"April Hill\\" and 95 acres to the Appalachian Trail Conference (ATC). The property now serves as the regional offices of the ATC and the Appalachian Mountain Club.

A handsome example of Greek Revival architecture, which still retains its original 36 over 36 sashes with glazed gothic arches, the church closed its doors in 1910. The building remained vacant for a number of years. In 1918 the building was purchased by the West Stockbridge/Alford Grange and underwent extensive renovations to the interior making it one of the \\"best Grange Halls of its day in Western Massachusetts.\\" These improvements included electricity, wainscoting the walls and vaulted ceiling, the installation of some of the original church pews on sidewall platforms and the addition of rock maple flooring. The choir was also enclosed and glazed pocket doors with early stained glass decals were installed. A dramatic theatrical stage was constructed at the back of the large open meeting room with a spectacular hand painted theater curtain which remains there today. The building was dedicated by members of that Grange on August 1, 1919 and the lofty 17’ ceiling, gothic windows, moldings and wainscoting remain intact from this time period. This building has been privately owned since 2007 and continues to be a meeting place for the West Stockbridge Grange which still houses their ceremonial artifacts there. These include a number of podiums, staffs, early wind and rain machines and various other items of historic interest. Occasionally the current owner has offered the building for use and as a fundraising tool by non-profit organizations. Amenities include a sound system, digital projector, 14’ x 9’ movie screen, spot lit mirror ball, dimmable lighting, comfortable upholstered seating, numerous side chairs and various folding tables.

Built in 1887, it is a prominent local work of architect Stanford White, and has served as a cultural center in the community since its construction, despite being moved in 1928. Now a part of the grounds of the Berkshire Theatre Festival, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The former Stockbridge Casino is set east of Stockbridge's Main Street downtown, at the northwest corner of Yale Hill Road and East Main Street. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. The roof is capped by a cupola, mounted in eight small round columns which are surrounded by a low balustrade. On the front roof face, the cupola flanked by round-headed dormers. The main facade has a projecting two-story center section, composed of three bays articulated by engaged round columns. Each of these bays has a paneled first floor and a rounded window on the second. Entrances are located flanking this projecting bay, accessed via stairs at differing elevations. The interior has undergone some alterations from its original appearance, due to its conversion to a theatrical performance space. Designed by Stanford White, the casino was built in 1887 near the western end of Main Street at the base of Prospect Hill, and for many years was a popular recreational and social attraction (according to older usages of the word \\"casino\\", it was not necessarily a gambling establishment). After falling into decline, the property was purchased in 1927 by Mabel Choate, owner of the nearby Naumkeag estate. She sought the property as a location for the Mission House, and was not interested in the casino building. She sold it for $1 to businessman and artist Walter Leighton Clark on the condition that it be moved. Together with sculptor Daniel Chester French and Dr. Austen Fox Riggs, he founded the Three Arts Society, which purchased the building and moved it to its current location. The building was renovated and reopened in 1928 as the Berkshire Playhouse, which later became the Berkshire Theatre Festival.

More than a century later, on June 13, 1985, the Texas Legislature passed a resolution noting that Rodriguez did not receive a fair trial. She has been the subject of two operas, numerous books, newspaper articles, and magazine accounts. Trial and execution Rodriguez was reportedly born December 30, 1799, in Mexico. She was a Mexican-American woman from the South Texas town of San Patricio who furnished travelers with meals and a cot on the porch of her lean-to on the Nueces River. She was accused of robbing and murdering a trader named John Savage with an axe. However, the $600 of gold stolen from him was found down river, where Savage's body was discovered in a burlap bag. She and Juan Silvera (who was possibly her illegitimate son) were indicted on circumstantial evidence and tried before 14th District Court judge Benjamin F. Neal at San Patricio. Although Rodriguez maintained her innocence, she refused to testify in her defense and remained silent throughout the trial, perhaps, some have speculated, to protect her guilty son. Although the jury recommended mercy, Neal ordered her executed. She was hanged on Friday, November 13, 1863. She was 63 at the time of her death. Her last words were quoted as being, \\"No soy culpable\\" (I am not guilty). At least one witness to the hanging claimed to have heard a moan from the coffin, which was placed in an unmarked grave. Her ghost is said to haunt San Patricio, especially when a woman is to be executed. Rodriguez is depicted as a spectre with a noose around her neck, riding through the mesquite trees or wailing from the riverbottoms. Cultural references Chipita Rodriguez has become a folk legend, and since the 1930s, there have been numerous alleged sightings of her ghost along the Nueces River where she was hanged. Rodriguez has been the subject of numerous books and newspaper articles. Rachel Bluntzer Hebert's epic-length poem \\"Shadows on the Nueces\\" and Teresa Palomo Acosta's poem \\"Chipita\\" both portray Rodriguez as a heroine. In 1993, the University of Texas music department performed the opera Chipita Rodriguez, composed by Texas A&M; University-Corpus Christi professor Lawrence Weiner. In 2010 a screenplay was written by Del Mar College and Texas A&M; University-Corpus Christi student screenwriter Cary Cadena.

Centered on the junction of Washington Mountain Road and Branch Road, the town center flourished from the town's establishment in the 1750s until the center of the town's business moved closer to the newly lain railroad in the 1830s. The district includes the old town hall, cemetery, common, and pound, as well as a number of residences. A meeting house (church) and schoolhouse once stood in the area, but the 1792 church was destroyed by lightning in 1859, and the schoolhouse is no longer extant. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The town of Washington is a rural community in the uplands of the Berkshires in western Massachusetts. Its early points of settlement were along Washington Mountain Road, which skirts the eastern flank of Mount Washington and served as an early stagecoach route between Pittsfield and Springfield. The town center arose near the highest point on the road, where its first meeting house was built around 1773. That building no longer stands, but the town common that was laid out next to it still survives as a large grassy expanse at the corner of Branch Road. The oldest surviving structure in this area is the animal pound, a rectangular stone structure built in 1783. The current town cemetery was established on the east side of Washington Mountain Road in 1805, and contains a few burials relocated from the town's first burying ground, which was also nearby. The historic town hall is next to the cemetery, built in 1848-49 and still occasionally used for civic functions. The two oldest houses in the district are the Elijah Crane House, built c. 1785-89, and the Jasper Morgan Tavern, built c. 1810-11. Both are good examples of Federal period architecture. Washington has always been a rural community, its early farmers struggling with poor soil and harsh climate. As a consequence, many began to leave as early as 1810 for better lands in Ohio and other areas further west. The town center consequently stagnated, and was supplanted even in civic importance by the routing of a railroad line further in the valley, where most of the town's civic and economic activity is now focused.

The post office was built by the federal government in 1932, during a period when the Postal Service was embarked in a construction program designed to provide jobs during the Great Depression. Prior to the construction of this building, the town's post office (established in 1798) was typically located in one of the town's commercial establishment. The building was designed by James Wetmore and built by the New England General Contractors Company on a site most recently occupied by the town's high school.

It was designed by architect Lorimer Rich and completed in 1936. Its design is unusual, because the United States Postal Service was at that time trying to economize on building costs in part by using standardized plans; this building is a notable deviation from this. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Great Barrington Main Post Office is located in downtown Great Barrington, on the west side of Main Street at its junction with Dresser Avenue. It was built principally of brick, with marble, wood, and concrete details. The building is basically rectangular, with a wooden portico supported by Doric columns projecting from the center of the building's front, providing shelter for the main entrance. The columns are of concrete, the steps leading to the entrance are of granite, and there is marble detailing on the building walls. Inside, the postmaster's office is to the left, while banks of post office boxes line the walls in an L shape on the right. The back of the building, where mail is processed, is separated from the public space by a service area. Great Barrington's position as a major economic center of southern Berkshire County since the early 19th century means it has had postal service since 1797. Until the construction of this building, those services were always provided in leased commercial spaces, private residences of the postmaster, and the local deed registry. The present building was designed by Lorimer Rich in 1935, and was completed in 1936 by D.A. Sullivan of Northampton. The Postal Service had in 1934 mandated the use of standardized plans from the Treasury Department's Office of the Supervising Architect for new post office construction. This building's neo-Classical design is the result of Rich's alteration of a standard plan.

Representing an expansion of Pittsfield's historic downtown area northward from Park Square in the late 19th century, the district encompasses primarily commercial buildings fronting on North Street between Columbus and Madison Avenues on the west side, and between Eagle and Maplewood Avenues on the east side. The notable exceptions are the Berkshire Eagle building, located on Eagle Street next to Sottile Park, and the St. Joseph's Church complex. The district features Colonial Revival and Renaissance style architecture. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. History Pittsfield's early civic and commercial development took place around Park Square Historic District, and was for most of the 19th century stopped at the railroad tracks of the Boston and Albany Railroad, which cross North Street three blocks north of Park Square. By 1890 the entire stretch of North Street between Park Square and the tracks was built out with commercial blocks. Early uses of the area north of the tracks (even before their construction) were as a militia training area and cantonment during the War of 1812, although the principal development that took place in the first half of the 19th century was residential. Part of the militia cantonment area was acquired by the Roman Catholic Church in 1863 for the construction of St. Joseph's, and the first masonry commercial block was built north of the tracks in 1875. An electric trolley was laid out on North Street in 1891, spurring commercial development that transformed the area over the next 30 years.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a complex roof line and mostly clapboarded exterior. A polygonal bay projects to the front and right side, with the main entrance to its left. The entrance is sheltered by a porch with turned posts, a spindled valance, and a decorative panel in the gable. The chimney has a decorative brick corbelling at the top. Windows on the second floor have decorative carving in the lintels above them. A single-story ell extends to the left, and a two-story ell extends to the rear. The house was built by the Porter & Hannum company, a leading homebuilder in North Adams, for Thomas Sykes, a supervisor at the North Adams Manufacturing Company. Sykes, a native of Vermont, spent 25 years with the company, in addition to working at other mills in the region. The house is not as elaborate or lavish as many Queen Anne designs, and its design may have originated in a mail-order catalog. The only major modification to the building was the addition in 1920 of a two- story porch structure on the rear right side.

The battle was the only naval engagement of the war, and showed the inability of either navy to gain a decisive advantage over the other. The Franco-Prussian War was a conflict between the Second French Empire (and later, the Third French Republic) and the various states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. Lasting from 19 July 1870 to 28 January 1871, the conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to expand German unification and French fears of the shift in the European balance of power that would result if the Prussians succeeded. A series of swift Prussian and German victories in eastern France, culminating in the Siege of Metz and the Battle of Sedan, saw French Emperor Napoleon III captured and the army of the Second Empire decisively defeated. A Government of National Defence declared the Third French Republic in Paris on 4 September and continued the war. During the war, both sides maintained a navy and engaged in naval operations around the globe. Most of the French fleet blockaded the German fleet in their harbours, although a few German ships managed to slip out and evade the French, proceeding to engage in commerce raiding against the French merchant marine or harass the French in other ways. The Meteor was one such ship who managed to elude the French blockade, sailing from Nassau to Havana. A French aviso, the Bouvet, noticed her and sailed outside the harbour of Havana. Havana was at the time ruled by Spain, a neutral country in the conflict, and the captain of the Bouvet issued a challenge, which the German captain accepted. The Meteor sailed out of the harbour on the ninth of November, and proceeded to engage the Bouvet. Despite both sides pouring fierce fire, neither side could inflict significant damage on the other ship, and after a German cannon shot temporarily disabled the engine of the Bouvet, the French were compelled to retire, safely withdrawing to neutral waters. Both captains were subsequently promoted for their bravery in the battle. Background SMS Augusta off Gironde, by Alexander Kircher. The war started with France having an overwhelming naval superiority over the naval forces of the various German States. The nascent German Navy was not in position to challenge its French opponent, and mostly remained safely inside its harbours. Despite this, a few German warships managed to harass the French in certain situations, such as in the Baltic, where the German aviso Grille exchanged fire with a French corvette when her flotilla challenged a French squadron off Zealand. On the 27th of August in 1870, SMS Nymphe, assigned to the defences of Neufahrwasser that protected Danzig, challenged a French squadron under Admiral Édouard Bouët-Willaumez, consisting of three ironclads and one aviso. Nymphe fired two broadsides at the French ironclad before escaping behind the coastal fortifications at Neufahrwasser.. The corvette SMS Augusta engaged in commerce raiding off Brest, capturing three French merchant ships. The French ironclad Héroïne chased her and Augusta had to escape to Vigo, where she found herself blockaded for the rest of the war. At 8 a.m. on 7 November 1870, Meteor, under Lieutenant Eduard von Knorr, arrived in the harbour of Havana after leaving Nassau some days before. Cuba was then a Spanish colony, with Spain being a neutral power during the Franco-Prussian war. An hour later the French aviso Bouvet, under Commander Alexandre Franquet arrived from Martinique, steaming in from the opposite direction. The next day the French mail steamer SS Nouveau Monde left the harbour for Veracruz but was forced to return a few hours later due to fears that she would be captured by the Prussian gunboat. Franquet issued a formal challenge to von Knorr, who accepted it...The New York Times, 19 November 1870. Bouvet steamed out of the harbour to wait for Meteor to meet her. Meteor had to wait twenty-four hours before she could meet the French vessel due to neutrality laws governing warfare at the time. She was under escort from the Spanish warships Hernán Cortés and Centinela, tasked with making certain the battle would take place off Cuba, outside territorial water, and thus ensure that the battle would not violate Spanish neutrality. Battle A plan of the battle, by E. Farret. Although the Bouvet could in theory outgun and outrun her opponent, her main gun was mounted on an obsolete mount that made it difficult to aim in regards to accuracy.. Furthermore, the boiler of the Bouvet had exposed and unprotected parts above deck, making her engine vulnerable to enemy fire. Franquet was keenly aware of this weak point in his ship, and had makeshift protection installed out of sandbags, coal bags and chains, position to protect the exposed parts of the engine from enemy fire.. Meteor, on the other hand, was a slower but more maneuverable ship. The two ships were evenly matched during the engagement. At 14:30, the action started with the Bouvet firing the first shots from four thousand metres, starting an artillery duel that failed to score any significant hit on either side for two hours. Around 16:30, Bouvet increased her speed to ten or eleven knots. and turned towards the Meteor, in an attempt to ram her. The ships collided under a steep angle; although the hull of the Meteor managed to resist the ramming attempt, the shock of the impact collapsed her rigging, sending sails and debris on her deck and, most significantly, wrapping lines around her propeller. German sailors attempted to use the opportunity to try and board the Bouvet, but the French sailors repelled them with rifle fire and the Bouvet quickly retreated to a safer distance.. As the Bouvet was preparing to ram the immobilised Meteor again, a German shell struck her exposed boiler, allowing her steam to leak on deck and rendering her dead in the water as well. The Bouvet then unleashed her sails and disengaged from the action, as German sailors attempted to free their propeller and give chase. As Bouvet reached Cuban territorial waters, the Spanish intervened to stop the battle, with the Spanish corvette Hernan Cortez firing a warning shot at the Meteor to signal to her that the engagement was over. Both the Bouvet and Meteor then sailed back to Havana.  Aftermath  The Bouvet disengaging under fire from Meteor, by Robert Parlow. Neither ship was permanently disabled from the action, with both warships mostly suffering damage to their masts and rigging (Bouvet's boilers and machinery remaining intact and functioning) and very few killed and injured on either side. The engagement was not considered militarily significant in the war by commentators of the day. The Meteor remained blockaded in Havana until the end of the war, unable to fulfill her purpose there of preying on French merchant shipping in the Caribbean. Figures for the losses on both sides are conflicting slightly, with The New York Times giving 2 killed and 1 wounded on the German side, while French sources mention 3 Germans killed and 9 wounded.. For the French, figures range from 3 wounded, 5 wounded or 10 killed or wounded. Both sides were satisfied with the outcome, Franquet being promoted to Captain (capitaine de vaisseau) on 17 December 1870,. and Von Knorr, receiving the Iron Cross 2nd Class and a promotion to Korvettenkapitän in 1871. Under diplomatic pressure from France, the Spanish shipyard in Havana delayed completing the repairs to Meteor until the war ended on 10 May 1871. Three days later, the ship departed for Germany; she sailed up the eastern coast of the United States and Canada before crossing the Atlantic. The Meteor reached Plymouth on 13 June and arrived in Kiel on the 25th. There, she was decommissioned on 20 July. From 18 September to 14 October, she was used as a stationary training ship for engine room personnel. On 6 May 1872, Meteor was recommissioned for survey work and was assigned to the Hydrographics Office of the Imperial Admiralty Meteor and her sister ship surveyed the German coast, ending in Mecklenburg on 20 October. The Bouvet was wrecked on 17 September 1871 off Île-à-Vache, when a gust of wind sent her onto a reef. The crew managed to safely abandon ship. Despite the insistence of the French Third Republic that the war would continue, a series of further defeats, including Paris being captured, forced the French government to finally surrender. The German states united into the German Empire under the Prussian king Wilhelm I, finally uniting most of Germany (excluding Austria) as a nation state. The Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871 gave Germany most of Alsace and some parts of Lorraine, which became the Imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine. French determination to regain Alsace-Lorraine and fear of another Franco-German war, along with British apprehension about the balance of power, became factors in the causes of World War I.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The town of Adams was settled by colonists in 1762, and was incorporated in 1778; its northern section was separated as North Adams in 1878. Early settlement took place on the eastern bank of the Hoosac River, along the area's main stagecoach route (now roughly Center and Orchard Streets). Industry developed along the river in the 19th century, and Summer Street, which roughly parallels the river on a rise to its east, became a fashionable neighborhood for the community's merchant and business elite. As the town industrialized in the 1830s and 1840s, a number of fine Greek Revival houses were built there, and it experienced a second major development push in the late 19th century, when a large number of Victorian homes were built. The principal avenue of the historic district is the block of Summer Street extending from Randall Street in the north to the junction with Center, Orchard, and Crandall Streets in the south. A number of properties are included along those three streets as well as side streets immediately adjacent. The district has 75 historic buildings, most of which are single-family residences built out of wood. Two church buildings (one now serving as a Masonic lodge) face each other across Center Street, and are included in the district, as are a series of early 20th-century multi-unit rowhouses. The streets are typically lined with trees, and the houses have modest setbacks. Particularly fine architectural examples include 72 Center Street, a c. 1840 Greek Revival house, and 4 Orchard Street, a detailed example of Second Empire architecture built in 1870.

The hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and the extensive estate grounds are open to the public as a nature preserve. History South Mountain was founded in 1918 by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, who had moved to the Berkshires in a bid to improve her husband's health. A longtime supporter of chamber music, Mrs. Coolidge in 1916 established the Berkshire String Quartet, which at first gave concerts in her home.

She became a sought-after line producer in the 1970s and 1980s that even the film greats such as Lino Brocka and Lupita Kashiwahara demanded that she work for them. She worked at ungodly hours. Her first taste of success was when she conceptualized Ang Bagong Kampeon (The New Champion) that became a huge primetime hit. The show kick-started other talent shows.

Baker (12 June 1928 – 28 February 1985) was a Canadian visual artist. Born in London, Ontario, Canada, she was adopted by Alfred Burrows Baker and Mabel Roberta Pearl Baker. She entered the University of Western Ontario where she was elected to the Art Students League, A.I.C., and Delta Phi Delta, National Art Fraternity, and graduated in 1950. She received a BFA and a MFA from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1954, and went on to teach art at Hathaway Brown School in Shaker Heights, Ohio for three years. She exhibited frequently in her home town of London, Ontario, and for many years at the 57th Street Art Fair in Chicago, and in many cities from Los Angeles to New York. In 1956 she won the top painting award in the Chicago Art Institute's 59th Chicago and Vicinity art annual for High Frequency Ping. Anna remained a Canadian citizen but for the last twenty nine years of her life, she lived in the village of Barton, Vermont where she opted to bow out of the world of dealers and galleries so she could work in her own way on her own terms. On 28 February 1985, Anna died in Kingston, Ontario from cancer. Anna integrated her eclectic interests into the subject matter of her paintings – * Theatre : The Ambrose Small Series (The ghost of Ambrose supposedly haunts the Grand Theatre in London). * Art : The Rosa Bonheur Series * History: Before Salisbury, Laura Secord and Her Cow, The Trojan Horse, Queen Victoria Reviewing the Troops with the Duke of Wellington After Landseer, Two Phoenicians * Literature: Don Quixote, The Cranford Series, Shakespearean Series, Reluctance (Robert Frost). * Biology: Numerous owl paintings, The Cornish Cat, Three Grouse, The Great Lobster Catch, Bird, Owl and a Very Fat Dog, Baboon, Butterflies and Moths. * Memories of her childhood: Tennis – 1910, Baseball Game -1910, Elmwood Bowling Green, Orangeman's Parade, With Mutes and Plumes, The Garden Party, The Victoria Jane. Anna obtained many awards including the Frank G Logan prize at the Chicago and Vicinity Exhibition in 1956 for \\"High Frequency Ping\\" and from the New England Press, Best Illustration, Daily, Class 1, First Place, The Sunday Times Argus.  Comments from critics  \\"Anna Baker works magnificently in many media. Her pictures reveal the true mark of genius – an originality and technical excellence that offer her viewers a glimpse into a personal world of her own devising.\\" Laurence Lariar, New York Art Dealer, 1967. Anna's \\"Unique sense of humour and incredible capacity for painstaking detail makes her work inimitable. Like all good art, Ms. Baker's compositions are basically abstract, but the images that she develops often are quizzical , evoked in dots, dashes, and color shapes that leave no area without interest.\\" \\"To own an Anna Baker drawing/painting is to be on daily contact with a blithe spirit who is also one of our most accomplished artists\\". Harold Hayden, art critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, 1979. \\"Fanciful geometric wisps, suggesting the architecture of flowers and snow stars form the cellular structure of man and beast as created by artist Anna Baker. Thus the detailing of these fine examples of decorative art is as complex as watchworks, as equisite as doilies. The method, rendered with ink, as well as watercolors and oil paints, becomes a tour de force, and the compositions are as stylized as stage sets for an allegory.\\" Beverly E. Johnson, Los Angeles Times Home Magazine, February 4, 1968. When the Chronicle in 1974 began publishing in Barton, Vermont, Anna \\"began illustrating its humour column. Her first illustration showed the artist seated on a Holstein cow....She began to submit cartoons featuring two wall-eyed Holsteins who regularly observe the triumphs and follies of the Northeast Kingdom\\" (NE Vermont). Tom Slayton, Sunday Times Argus, Sept.4, 1983. \\"Anna P. Baker, former Chicagoan creates a marvelous storybook world of her own in her infinitely detailed, intricate paintings and drawings. Her work can be seen here only at the Little Gallery, 1328 E. 57th St. which is directed by Mary Louise Womer and Mrs. Carl Schniewind, widow of the late director of the Art institute's prints and drawings department. Visitors flock to see a Baker show, and to see the superb ceramics of Otto and Gertrude Natzler of California.....Miss Baker's collection is called \\"Chiefly Cornish\\" having been done during a year's visit to Cornwall, England. The 35 pictures are filled with the high quality and the charm of her work. Her pen often reveals her lively wit as well as her originality and her imagination\\". Edith Weigle, art critic for Chicago Sunday Tribune, November 19, 1961.  Artwork  Anna's memories around her home town, London, Ontario are transcribed into an earlier time frame in such works as: \\"London Airport - 1910\\", \\"Elmwood Bowling Green\\", \\"The Victoria Jane\\", \\"Tennis\\", \\"Baseball Game\\", \\"Orangeman's Parade\\", \\"With Mutes and Plumes\\" and \\"The Garden Party\\". The Shakespearean series was inspired by a visit to the Stratford Festival Theatre in Stratford, Ontario in the mid-1960s. \\"Festival\\", \\"Richard III\\", \\"Henry V\\", \\"Malvolio\\" and \\"Taming of the Shrew\\" are the titles of some of the paintings from this series. Help was received from a Canada Council Grant, 1968. Loving theatre, Anna delved into the Ambrose Small story. Ambrose was the proprietor of the Grand Theatre (now Theatre London) who disappeared Dec 2, 1919 after selling his theatrical holdings, leaving his wife, $2 million and a legal tangle. His legend has inspired many words and the continuing rumour that his ghost haunts Theatre London. Anna envisioned productions as they might have been in the time of Small. Twenty-four paintings were exhibited at the Nancy Poole Studio including \\"Ambrose Small Production of Rose Marie\\", \\"Ambrose Small; Production of the Dumbbells\\", \\"An Ambrose Small Production of \\"Polly of the Circus\\" in which Ambrose is depicted floating over the top of the production, \\"Ambrose Small Production of Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" and \\"Ladies of the Chorus\\". There are two series of paintings and drawings from the book, \\"Cranford (novel)\\" by Elizabeth Gaskell. In the last series of 13 paintings, the titles included \\"The Cat that Swallowed the Lace\\", \\"He Knew Cream Quite Well and Constantly Refused Tea With Only Milk in It\\", and \\"If the Supposed Robbers Would Come to Him He would Fight Them\\", \\"Our Idea of the Dignity of Silence was Paling Before our Curiosity\\", \\"She Did Not Seem to Notice the Extraordinary Size and Complexity of Her Headdress\\". Illustrating her interest in history, Anna created her lithograph \\"The Trojan Horse\\" while still at the Art Institute in Chicago. Anna painted 18 paintings in which she visualized the French realist painter and sculptor, Rosa Bonheur, on imaginary world travels. \\"The Ascension of Rosa Bonheur Over Niagara Falls\\", \\"Rosa Bonheur in Venice\\", \\"Rosa Bonheur is Late for the Ambassador's Ball\\" are a few from this series. These were exhibited at the Howell Gallery in London, Canada. Anna felt very much akin to Rosa whose whole life was Art. Anna often signed her letters, \\"Rosa Bonheur of the Northeast Kingdom\\", the Northeast Kingdom being northeast Vermont. This was put on her tombstone in Scottsville, Ontario. Anna painted or sketched owls throughout her career; the Holstein cow or cows were her signature cartoons for The Chronicle (Barton, Vermont) newspaper. Anna also did a series on Circus Parade which included such works as: \\"Circus Wagon with Lion\\", \\"Circus Wagon with Bears\\", \\"Circus Wagon with Mermaid\\", \\"Circus Parade with Walrus\\", \\"Circus Wagon with Alligator\\", \\"Marching Circus Band\\" and \\"Circus Wagons with Monkeys and Giraffes\\".

The band parodies turbo-folk music by combining it with heavy metal and humorous lyrics.  Band history = Formation and breakup (1993-1997)  The first idea of combining hard rock and heavy metal with turbo-folk came up in the early 1990s when Saša Friš, a guitar player from Novi Sad wrote a song called \\"Veče na plaži\\" (\\"An Evening at the Beach\\") later rerecorded as \\"Ostavljen sam ja\\" (\\"I've Been Left\\"). Friš was joined by Dragan \\"Sneki\\" Jovanić who did the arrangements and production. Both songs were recorded in 1993. Following the arrival of vocalists Željko Jojkić, Friš wrote another song called \\"Srca tvoga plam\\" (\\"A Sparkle of Your Heart\\") later rerecorded as \\"Došli smo do kraja puta\\" (\\"We Came to the End of the Road\\"). In order to continue their work, Friš needed a full-time band so Tibor Lakatoš (bass guitar) and Srđan Milovanović (drums) were recruited. The band got the name by a character from Alan Ford comic book. As the amount of material became bigger, the idea of recording an album became apparent and the band entered the \\"Pro Sound\\" studio in Novi Sad in the summer of 1994 to record their debut album. Pero Defformero was released in the autumn of 1995 through record label Music YUser. The album consisted of nine tracks and promotional video was recorded for the track \\"Srca tvoga plam\\". After the album was released, Jojkić and Lakatoš left the band and were replaced by Goran Biševac (vocals) and Miroslav Mijatović (bass). The band then recorded their second album Pero Defformero II (also known as Nazovi drugi album or Napalm, Nitro, Turbo, Disko) which was never officially released. In the meantime the band changed the lineup featuring Slobodan Stanojević instead of Milovanović on drums. Due to misunderstandings, the band ceased to exist in 1997.  Reformation (2003-present)  In 2003 a fan recognized some of the band members and managed to persuade them to reunite and start playing again and after seven years the band became active again. After performing for a while and making a small pause in their work the band entered \\"Mr. Big\\" studio in 2006. The demo recorded consisted of four tracks produced by Dragan Jovanić and was presented on their official Myspace. Some of the tracks appeared on the debut album, but were rerecorded and renamed. The lineup changed for the last time when bassist Mijatović left due to personal reasons and was replaced by Nenad Kovačević. Together they participated the various artists tribute to Đorđe Balašević called Neki noviji klinci i..., with the cover version of \\"Jaroslava\\". In January 2008, the band entered \\"Piknik\\" studio to record their long-awaited second album consisting of new material and remixed old songs from Pero Defformero and the never- released Pero Defformero II. A year later, in January 2009, Undergrand appeared through Multimedia Records and a promotional video was released for the track \\"Dosli smo do kraja puta\\". The band continued promoting the new album throughout 2010, also performing the single from the upcoming album, \\"Sedmica na Lotu\\" (\\"Seven Hits in a Lottery Game\\").http://www.trablmejker.com/emisije/3/1580 In November 2012, the band announced their upcoming album Novokomponovani Senti-Metal (Newly Composed Senti-Metal) with a video for the song \\"Volim te...

Holy Trinity is one of the many Eastern Orthodox churches in Lowell, along with St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church, Transfiguration of Our Savior Greek Orthodox Church, and St. George Greek Orthodox Church. The church is under the jurisdiction of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and is locally administered by the Metropolis of Boston. The church is located the Downtown Lowell neighborhood known as The Acre. It was built in 1906 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Holy Trinity was the first church built for a Greek Orthodox congregation in the United States. It is known for its golden dome, mosaics, iconography, and rich history. Archbishop Iakovos of America, who led the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America from 1959 through 1996, was ordained as a priest at Holy Trinity on June 16, 1940.  History  The church was built because of the growing population of Greek immigrants in Lowell at the time. Construction started in 1906, and the church opened in 1908. It is the first church in America that was built specifically for a Greek congregation.Marilyn J. Chiat, America's Religious Architecture, Wiley, 1997 p. 52 It was accepted for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places on April 13, 1977. In late 2010, the congregation started restoration work on the church. The exterior was refurbished, and the water damage in the interior is being repaired. In addition, many of the icon murals were restored.  Hellenic American Academy  The Hellenic American Academy was formed on March 4, 1906. It was first called the Greek Parochial School. The academy was first located in the basement of the church. It was the first Greek Orthodox Academy in America, and was established by some of the same Greek Immigrants who founded the church. The Academy is now located on Broadway adjacent to the church and educates children in grades K-8.  Architecture  Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church was built in 1906 as the first Byzantine-style church in America. The building was finished in 1908. The building takes the shape of a cross, like most traditional Greek Orthodox Churches. The structure is Lowell architect Henry L. Rourke's interpretation of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople.http://www.richardhowe.com/2011/02/04/holy-trinity-greek- orthodox-church-2/ Inside the church, mosaics decorate the narthex.

She made 132 appearances mostly in film between 1941 and 2006, but most of her work has been in Spanish cinema. Biography Helga Liné was born Helga Lina Stern on 14 July 1932 in Berlin, Germany. During the Nazi regime she fled Germany at a young age with her family, and took refuge in Portugal. At the age of just 9 she made her first film appearance there in the film Porto de Abrigo. Helga was a dancer and acrobat in circus performances in Portugal throughout the 1940s and later became a model. In the 1950s she made further film appearances, but her career took off after she moved to Madrid in 1960. From this point, the red-headed actress made many appearances in the 1960s, particularly in horror and action films. She also starred in the spaghetti westerns In a Colt's Shadow (1965) and Have a Good Funeral, My Friend... Sartana Will Pay (1970). Although she appeared in giallo films such as So Sweet...

Retina Reflex The Kodak Type 025 Retina Reflex is an SLR camera with so called convertible lenses (German: Wechselobjektiv), interchangeable lens components made by Kodak AG Stuttgart, Germany. It was made between Spring 1957 and October 1958. Like many SLR cameras of German heritage it works with a leaf shutter instead of a focal plane shutter. It was named Type 025 Retina Reflex since it inherited several features from the Retina rangefinder cameras, like the Retina IIIc: The film advance and exposure counting system, the film channel, the selenium meter, and the focusing mechanics of the lenses. Even the Synchro-Compur shutter is very similar to the earlier designs. The early Retina reflex models are basically fixed-lens cameras with interchangeable front elements. Later models had fully interchangeable lenses. In the first models - the front three elements are contained in a cell that bayonets into the front of the lens assembly. The standard front cell can be replaced with one of three Schneider components - an 80mm and two different 35mm components. The rear part of the lens (which is a permanent part of the camera body) contains the focusing apparatus, the entire Synchro-Compur shutter, the aperture, and the three rear elements, which are common to all 4 lenses. This interchangeable front component concept was introduced in 1954 with the folding Retina IIc and IIIc models. Care must be exercised when using front components other than the standard (50mm) one, as it is possible to set the body mounted aperture wider than the maximum aperture of the lens (i.e. f/2 instead of f/4 or f/5.6). A similar system was introduced in 1953 with the Contaflex (SLR). The Retina Reflex is, on rare occasions, found with very similar lenses made by Rodenstock. As the Rodenstock front components are not compatible with the Schneider rear component (and vice versa), minor changes were made to the bayonet mount for each manufacturer. These interchangeable Retina lens components can also be used on the Retina IIc, IIC, IIIc, and IIIC rangefinder cameras. The camera offers the convenience of image composition with wide open aperture. The aperture is stopped down to the selected value after the shutter is released. After exposure the mirror stays up until the bottom-mounted single-stroke film advance lever is again wound. Focusing is via a ground glass screen with a central split-image rangefinder. The camera's top plate has the manually set frame counter, the shutter release, the film rewind knob with film reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the film (advance) release button, the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the tripod socket, the film advance lever, the back release latch, and the film rewind release button. In use, the Retina Reflex frame counter works down from 35 (or 20) to 0, at which point the film advance locks. While this is convenient for the user and does prevent torn film sprockets at the end of a roll, setting the counter up properly at the beginning of a roll is complex, awkward, and time-consuming. This is a typical example of much of Retina engineering - complex and ingenious, but perhaps over-engineered. The non-coupled selenium cell exposure meter reads out in exposure values (EVs) only. The camera is then set to the proper EV setting via an easily reached aperture release tab, though the EV scale itself is rather inconveniently located on the underside of the lens assembly. Once the aperture release tab is set and released, the shutter ring is coupled to the aperture ring - moving the shutter ring automatically moves the aperture ring, so that the same exposure value is maintained. In other words, when in use, the camera is normally locked into one EV setting until the aperture release tab is pressed. Needless to say this can be confusing to those unfamiliar with the camera. All the Retina Reflex cameras are remarkably complex instruments and quite heavy for their size. The Retina Reflex originally sold for $215 USDHistory of Kodak Cameras at Kodak.com (app. $1,820 USD in 2014). Approximately 65,000 were made. Lenses for the Retina Reflex The Retina Reflex can be fitted with four different lenses (also for the Retina IIc, IIC, IIIc, and IIIC cameras). They all share a common set of three elements at the rear of the lens. List of Schneider-Kreuznach Retina convertible lenses: * Schneider-Kreuznach Retina- Curtar-Xenon C 35mm f/4 * Schneider-Kreuznach Retina-Curtar-Xenon C 35mm f/5.6 (6+3 elements in 6 groups) * Schneider-Kreuznach Retina-Xenon C 50mm f/2 (3+3 elements in 4 groups) * Schneider-Kreuznach Retina-Xenon C 50mm f/2.8 * Schneider-Kreuznach Retina-Longar-Xenon C 80mm f/4 (6+3 elements in 6 groups) List of Rodenstock Retina convertible lenses: *Rodenstock Retina-Heligon C 35mm f/4 *Rodenstock Retina-Heligon C 35mm f/5.6 *Rodenstock Retina-Heligon C 50mm f/2 *Rodenstock Retina-Heligon C 50mm f/2.8 *Rodenstock Retina-Heligon C 80mm f/4 Retina Reflex S Introduced in 1959, the Type 034 Retina Reflex S was a major redesign of the original Retina Reflex. The major difference is its use of fully interchangeable lenses, the same lenses that were made for the Kodak Retina IIIS rangefinder camera. The lens mount is commonly referred to as the Deckel mount, after the manufacturer of the Prontor, Compur and other shutters. This same mount, with minor differences, was also used by a number of other German camera makers, including Braun and Voigtländer. It was also used in the later Retina Reflex III, Retina Reflex IV, and the Kodak Instamatic Reflex. As for the original Retina Reflex, lenses were available from both Schneider and Rodenstock, but this time the lenses had identical bayonet mounts. The shutter is a Synchro-Compur behind the lens unit, which is part of the camera body. The aperture is now in the interchangeable lenses, which eliminates the overexposure problem of the original Retina Reflex. Speed are from 1 sec. to 1/500th plus bulb. It features M and X syncs and a self- timer. What was the meter adjustment knob on the top plate is now a fixed housing for the ASA/DIN scale. The selenium cell exposure meter is now coupled to a \\"setting wheel\\" located on the very bottom of the lens mount. This setting wheel sets adjusts the camera's exposure value (EV) by changing (in a most complex fashion) the aperture and/or shutter rings at the same time that it changes the depth-of-field pointers on the camera's lens. When another button (located on the top plate) is pushed simultaneously, the setting wheel is also used to set the exposure meter's ASA/DIN setting. The top plate, bottom plate, and camera body are otherwise nearly identical to the Retina Reflex. The Retina Reflex S originally sold for $235 USD (app. $1,920 USD in 2014). Approximately 78,000 were made. Retina Reflex III Bottom of the Retina Reflex III with the winding lever, the frame counter, the counter advance button and the back opening A later variant is the Type 041 Retina Reflex III. It was made from 1960 to 1964. Its match-needle meter instrument scale is visible in the viewfinder as well as on the top plate. The camera was originally equipped with the same coupled selenium meter as the Reflex S, but after 1962 a larger one was fitted, again made by Gossen. The Reflex III features the same \\"setting wheel\\" and interlocking aperture/shutter rings as the Reflex S. As it was fashion in the early 1960s the shutter release button on top was replaced by a shutter release shifter beside the lens mount. The film advance release button was eliminated, that function being incorporated in the frame reset slider, which was moved to the bottom plate along with the (still) manually reset frame counter. The ASA setting button was moved from the ASA dial to the spot vacated by the release button. This redesign made a new camera case design necessary, leaving additional space for the frame counter, and the frame reset slider. The Retina Reflex cases were already something special before since the film advance lever (Reflex) and aperture/shutter setting wheel (Reflex S) are located on the bottom. The photo shows just how complex the Retina case had become. The Reflex III has the same aperture/shutter setting wheel (which Kodak called simply the \\"setting wheel\\") and interlocking aperture/shutter rings as the Reflex S. The Retina Reflex III originally sold for $248.50 USD (app. $2,000 USD in 2014). Approximately 116,000 were made. Retina Reflex IV The Type 051 Retina Reflex IV was made from 1964 to 1967. It has a characteristic little window in the front of its pentaprism housing, which displays the aperture in use in the viewfinder. The accessory shoe now had flash contacts. The frame counter now automatically resets to 36 when the back is opened; the frame advance slider is used to set the counter for shorter rolls. The split-image rangefinder on the ground glass is now at a 45 degree angle. The Retina Reflex IV originally sold for $277 USD (app. $2,130 USD in 2014). Over 524,000 were made.

It is one of 69 fish hatcheries operated by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. It was established in 1888. History Neosho, located in the Ozark Mountain region of southwest Missouri, was chosen for the hatchery site because of access to spring water and the railroad. Land for the fish hatchery was purchased from Lemuel B. and Mary A. Hearrell for $2,472. The first source of water for the hatchery, Hearrell Spring, was purchased from the Hearrells for $1 and provided 300 gallons of water per minute. By 1890, the fish hatchery was a productive fish station raising seven species of warm and cold water fish. In 1907, McMahon Spring was added to increase the hatchery water supply to 1,000 gallons per minute. A rehabilitation program was undertaken at the fish hatchery in 1961. A new, modern, tile and brick hatchery building replaced the 1890 hatching house. All trout rearing facilities were removed and replaced with 12 concrete raceways. The title was obtained for of land on the Fort Crowder Military Reservation near Neosho upon which Elm and Bartholic Springs are located. This provided an additional 500 gallons per minute to the hatchery's water supply. Role of Fish Hatcheries in conservation Neosho Hatchery in 1896 The US Fish and Wildlife Service operates fish hatcheries throughout the United States. These hatcheries are a significant part of fisheries conservation and restoration efforts by producing and releasing rare, endangered and other fish back into America’s lakes and rivers. Some of these hatcheries also help mitigate the loss of fishing from the large federal dams built in the last century. Over 130 species of cold, cool, and warm water fish have been produced at the Neosho NFH since it was established. The current focus is on paddlefish and lake sturgeon restoration, pallid sturgeon recovery, production of rainbow trout for mitigation, and native mussel propagation. The staff at the Neosho Fish Hatchery also protect the endangered Ozark cavefish in one of the springs that supplies the hatchery with water. In 1989, staff discovered Ozark cavefish using the spring. In 2002 efforts were taken to protect the area surrounding. The hatchery water supply is from four gravity flow underground springs, located up to four miles (6 km) from the hatchery. The 1,500 gallons of 54- to 64-degree, high-quality water per minute allows hatchery staff to produce up to 90,000 pounds of fish annually and to rear several species of imperiled fish and other aquatic species.

The most common use of such light meters is measuring the exposure value for photography. The electric part of such a meter is an electromagnetic measuring instrument which is connected to the anode and cathode of a selenium photo cell that produces more or less electric power when exposed to more or less light. The optical part of such a meter is a window in front of the photo cell's light-sensitive side. The window's surface is usually structured like a honeycomb made of convex lenses. This type of window helps to bundle the light coming from the direction in which the photo cell is pointed. The mechanical part of a selenium meter is an analog calculator which accepts exposure value and film speed as input parameters for showing the possible aperture and shutter-speed combinations for correct exposure.  Types of meters =Match-needle meters match needle meter =Uncoupled meter= Zenit. The simplest type of match-needle selenium meter shows a clockhand on the meter's scale. This can be moved by turning one slice of the analog calculator. When the clockhand matches the instrument's needle the EV-value is set right on the calculator. The picture on the right shows the device of the Zenit - E model, mounted on a left side of the camera. The inner (flat) circle rotates with the help of the knob and sets the film sensitivity (visible in both DIN and ASA units through tiny windows). The outer circle is coupled to the moving O - shaped marker in the scale on the left and must be rotated till the marker covers the needle (visible in the left corner). The recommended exposures can be read on a side scale against the possible apertures (top scale). The device is not directly coupled to actual aperture and exposure controlsUser manual of Zenith E photocamera Coupled meters Detachable couple light meter on a Leica M3 Zeiss Ikon Contaflex Super B camera with built in coupled selenium meter Tessina subminiature camera with coupled selenium meter Minox B with built in coupled match needle selenium meter More sophisticated cameras have the match-needle instrument coupled directly to aperture and shutter speed setting rings on the lens tube instead to a separate analog calculator. This is the most convenient way of match-needle instrument usage, especially when the meter's scale is mirrored into the viewfinder. =Manual control Coupled meter= Various models of Zeiss Ikon Contaflex SLR and Contessa camera has built in couple match needle selenium meter. Changing the aperture and/or shutter speed and move the red marker hand with a \\"O\\" shape loop, such that the \\"o\\" aligned with the selenium meter needle, the shutter speed and aperture is thus selected. Minox B and Tessina has manually coupled meter. =Automatic couple meter= With Zeiss Ikon Contaflex Super B, when in automatic mode, when changing the shutter speed, the camera automatically selects the right aperture according to the value indicated by the built in selenium meter needle. In the beginnings of exposure automation (ca. 1960) the instruments were even used for setting exposure settings directly, mainly for automatic aperture setting. A simple method for this was called \\"trap-needle\\"; pressing the shutter release mechanically gripped the meter needle, then moved an aperture control up to hit the needle, setting the aperture to a value controlled by the meter. This kind of attempt to automate exposure setting was common in an era were precision mechanical engineers didn't know any limits of complication so that even further steps were gone to use selenium photo cells to control all exposure settings, or to control them more exactly with help of electro-mechanical aids. Heinz Waaske's SLR construction Edixa Electronica was such a costly attempt. The construction problem was the low electric power delivered by the photo cell. It was a precision mechanical wonder that a handful of cameras were made which had automatic exposure control driven by a selenium meter, without need of further electronic or electromechanical support, for example the Optima. A compromise for expensive rangefinder or SLR or twin lens reflex cameras was to offer a selenium meter as optional device that could be coupled to the camera's shutter speed controls.

He served as assistant to Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin. Life Peter Henry Lemke was born 27 July 1796 at Rehna in Mecklenburg. His father was a magistrate. His maternal grandfather was the village schoolmaster and lived with the family, as did the elderly village doctor. With the aid of his grandfather and the doctor, who supplied him with story books, he received a good basic education. After the death of his grandfather, Peter ran away at the age of fourteen and applied for admission to the school at Shwerin. His father, who admired his initiative, wished him well, but due to reduced circumstances was unable to provide any financial assistance. Peter supported himself by giving music lessons, supplemented by the charity of the townspeople.Flick, Lawrence F. “Biographical Sketch Of Rev. Peter Henry Lemke, O. S. B. 1796-1882.” Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia, vol. 9, no. 2, 1898, pp. 129–192. JSTOR In 1813, at the age of eighteen, Lemke enlisted in the army to fight against Napoleon. He served until the end of war, after which he enrolled in the Lutheran seminary at the University of Rostock. When not indulging in student dissipation, he read Stolberg's Religion of Jesus Christ, which made a lasting impression. In 1819, he passed his examinations for the ministry and accepted a position as tutor in a wealthy family near his hometown. Having developed religious reservations, he resigned his position and travelled for a while. In Ratisbon, through a former schoolfellow, he met and became friends with Melchior von Diepenbrock. They were of the same age and both war veterans. After Diepenbrock was ordained a Catholic priest, Lemke attended Father Diepenbrock's first Mass. Eight months later, Lemke applied to Bishop Johann Michael Sailer for admission to the Catholic Church. Sailer went him to the Ratisbon diocesan seminary where he studied under Georg Michael Wittman. On 21 April 1824, he was received into the Church, Diepenbrock standing as godfather. Sailer sent him to one of his old parish priests, Father Buchner, pastor of a country parish near Ratsbon, to study theology, and on 11 April 1826 he was ordained. For the next three years, Father Lemke served as assistant to Buchner. In 1829, he was called to Ratisbon to instruct the students of the high school, and to preach to the garrison. In 1831, he accepted the position of chaplain on an estate owned by Friedrich Christoph Schlosser near Heidelberg. As his duties there were not overtaxing, he soon took up the responsibilities of estate manager. In Heidelberg, he became friends with Clemens Brentano. A mutual friend, Dr. Raes, showed him a letter from Bishop Kenrick of Philadelphia deploring the lack of German priests to serve his parishioners. With the prodding of Brentano, Lemke determined to go to Philadelphia. Sending his baggage ahead, he set out on foot for Paris, where he took a steamboat to Le Havre. However, his baggage not yet having arrived, his departure was delayed some weeks. He spent the time ministering to other German emigrants awaiting departure. He later learned that the first packet boat had been lost at sea.Wirtner O.S.B., Modestus. \\"The Benedictine Fathers in Cambria County Pennsylvania\\", Cambria County Archives, 1925 America On 20 August 1834, Lemke arrived in New York on the ship Florida and took a steamer to Philadelphia, where Bishop Kenrick assigned him as an assistant to Father Guth, pastor of Holy Trinity Church, Philadelphia, the first German national parish in the United States.\\"Bulletin\\", Old St. Mary Church/Holy Trinity Church On his first night, he was called out to attend a cholera patient. He went every day to the Bishop's residence to instruct Bishop Kenrick and is brother, Peter Richard Kenrick in German, while they, in turn, taught him English. His skill improved through his missionary tours in which he was often forced to communicate in English. Two months late, he was sent as assistant to the aged and infirm Prince Gallitzin at Loretto, Pennsylvania. In 1835, there were only four German priests in a diocese that covered Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. He took up his residence in the neighbouring town of Ebensburg, from where he attended to a portion of Father Gallitzin's district, about fifty miles in extent. He travelled by rail, stagecoach, wagon, and horseback to visit the scattered settlements. Lemke was a fearless horseman and delighted to give to the admiring settlers exhibitions of his skill in riding and subduing wild and untrained colts. In September 1835, he accompanied Bishop Kenrick on a visitation of the western part of Pennsylvania. One Sunday a month he attended the Catholics working on the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal and the Allegheny Portage Railroad at Johnstown. He and Father Gallitzin were the only priests in the county. In the spring of 1837 he bought some land on which two years later he laid out a town which, in honour of the first Catholic Bishop in the United States, John Carroll, he called Carrolltown.

At Saltzberg he was present at the consecration of his friend Diepenbrock as Prince-Bishop of Breslau. In Munich he met several Benedictines of the Monastery of Metten. Father Lemke was instrumental in bringing to the United States the first Benedictines, under the leadership of Father Boniface Wimmer, the future Archabbot of St. Vincent's, in Pennsylvania. Lemke himself joined the new Benedictine community in 1852. In 1855 Lemke went as missionary to Kansas, and prepared the way for the foundation of St. Benedict's Abbey at Atchison. Lemke Hall, a residence hall at Benedictine College near St. Benedict's Abbey in Atchison, is named in his honor. In 1856 he was lost on the Kansas prairie in a driving rainstorm. As a convert, he was not in the habit of praying to Mary, but he did so then and shortly saw a faint light in the distance, where a woman in a distant cabin, whose young child had called out to her, had just lit a lantern.

His 21st novel, it was published by Doubleday and released in the United States on January 26, 2009. Plot summary As an idealistic graduate of Yale Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal, Kyle McAvoy has the promise of a highly successful career, although after graduation, he intends to devote three years to public service before applying for employment with a prestigious firm. His plans are derailed when he is approached by two FBI agents (or such they seem) who interrogate him and then pass him on to a mysterious man known only as Bennie Wright. Bennie has a videotape of a party that took place in Kyle's apartment five years earlier, when he was an undergraduate student at Duquesne University. In it, two of Kyle's fraternity brothers, Joey Bernardo and Baxter Tate, are seen having sexual relations with Elaine Keenan, a co-ed who later claimed she was raped while unconscious, a charge seemingly supported by Joey's asking Baxter, \\"Is she awake?\\" on the tape. At the time, the incident was investigated by local police, who determined there had been no assault and declined to take further action. With the tape now in his possession, Bennie threatens to expose Kyle's secret unless he cooperates with Bennie and his associates. Bennie's plan is to have Kyle accept a position at New York City-based Scully & Pershing, the world's largest law firm, which is representing Trylon Aeronautics in its case against Bartin Dynamics. The two defense contractors had joined forces to design the B-10 HyperSonic Bomber for The Pentagon, and when they won the contract over Lockheed, the competitor sought support from senators and lobbyists. Legal battles ensued, and Trylon and Bartin, each laying claim to ownership of the design and technologies developed for the project, are now ready to wage battle against each other in court. Kyle will be required to infiltrate Scully & Pershing's files and deliver to Bennie crucial information desired by the people he represents. His first instinct is to ignore Bennie's blackmail threats and deal with whatever consequences might arise, but the thought of the shame and embarrassment his family would suffer if he is indicted for the incident in his past, not to mention the negative impact on his own future, leads him to agree to Bennie's demands. Constantly under surveillance while outdoors and living in an apartment in which he knows bugs and cameras have been hidden, Kyle slowly learns how to trick those who are trailing him into believing he is unaware of their presence. He seeks help from Joey, who has more to lose than Kyle does if the videotape is made public, and with his old friend as a somewhat unwilling accomplice, plots to outwit his blackmailer. He creates an interest in different spy novels, and buys them at a used book store. He learns about all the different technical components and devices used for spying and learns about a shop nearby, whose owners claimed to be \\"Ex- CIA,\\" specializing in gadgets and devices specially used for surveillance. What he doesn't anticipate is the re-emergence of Elaine, who still maintains she was raped, and Baxter, who has completed a lengthy stint in rehab and, as part of his twelve-step program, wants to make amends to the girl he raped. His admission of guilt will give Elaine the proof she needs to file charges, and with Kyle drawn into the spotlight, his position at Scully & Pershing will be jeopardized, a risk Bennie must eliminate by any means. Baxter is found shot dead, with no evidence of the murderer's identity, although Kyle is certain that Bennie ordered it. After working at the law firm's 'boot camp' for some months, as do all new associates, Kyle eventually gets drawn into the Trylon case and is granted access to the highly secure computer room where the confidential information is stored. Bennie and Nigel, a computer expert, force him to use a thumbdrive to download the files, which he does. But by this time, realizing that Bennie is nearly always one step ahead of him, Kyle has spoken to Roy Benedict, a criminal lawyer and former FBI operative. He tells Roy the whole story. Roy still has good connections within the FBI, and they set up an operation to catch Bennie while Roy transfers information that is not sensitive. But it misfires; Bennie and his associates vanish and remain unidentified and unapprehended, although Kyle thinks he's working for some other branch of the government. Kyle admits his actions to the firm's partners, and agrees to leave their employ immediately and not practice law in New York. He also voices his belief that one of the firm's partners has acted as a 'mole,' passing information to Bennie. Refusing the FBI's offer of witness protection, Kyle goes home to his father, also a lawyer, who knows the whole sorry saga and had already signed a deal with Elaine and her lawyer. Kyle plans to become a partner in his father's law firm, namely McAvoy & McAvoy. Roy, himself a highly paid New York lawyer, is a bit surprised at Kyle's decision: \\"The Editor of the Yale Law Journal - practicing law on Main Street in York, Pennsylvania?\\" to which Kyle answers exuberantly: \\"I have never been more serious! Real clients. Real people. Real cases. Deer hunting on Saturdays, Steelers on Sundays. A real life.\\" Background Grisham's plot is based in part on the case of a Las Vegas man who, as part of his Alcoholics Anonymous program, wrote a letter of apology to a woman he had raped at a fraternity party at the University of Virginia in 1984. Her claim had been ignored by the police and school officials at the time, but nineteen years later his admission of guilt resulted in his being charged with rape and eventually serving six months in prison after plea bargaining. Critical reception Janet Maslin of the New York Times stated, \\"Mr. Grisham so often writes similar books that the same things must be said of them. The Associate is true to form: it grabs the reader quickly, becomes impossible to put down, stays that way through most of its story, and then escalates into plotting so crazily far-fetched that it defies resolution. Kyle McAvoy is another of the two-dimensional yet terrifically likeable heroes who come to life on Mr. Grisham’s pages only to evaporate later. It’s easy to predict what choice Kyle will make at the end of the novel. It’s impossible to imagine, let alone care, what his life will be like once the improbably wild furor surrounding this one lone law-firm recruit is over.\\" Richard Rayner of the Los Angeles Times said, \\"Nobody goes to Grisham for style, and there's a sense here of a skilled craftsman cranking it out on autopilot. Nothing much happens, and when it happens, it's pretty predictable. Grisham's Kyle is cardboard-thin (Scott Turow has a much defter hand with character), but Grisham is an effective lens through which we observe the intricacies of corporate law, an easily corruptible world governed, not by right and wrong, but by the concept of the billable hour . . . The Associate springs to angry life from time to time, but on the whole it's by the numbers, a plodding page-turner. But it's still a page-turner: Many of Grisham's legions of fans will doubtless sign up for this latest ride, eager to see how Kyle McAvoy manages to get himself out of the hole. With ideals restored, Grisham ensures, making Kyle an appealing model for our troubled new time.\\" Patrick Anderson of the Washington Post observed, \\"Grisham has long since proved his narrative talent. His plot is highly fanciful, and he makes it easy for us to keep flipping the pages to see if Kyle can find a way out of this mess. He mostly writes clean, workmanlike prose, but I have one stylistic complaint about the novel. It's important to Grisham not only that Kyle be seen as noble, but also that his tormentor be a rat. Thus, as Bennie spits out his nefarious demands, we're variously told that he speaks 'with a sneer,' with a 'smart-ass grin,' with a 'silly smirk.' Enough already; we get it.\\" Charles Taylor of Newsday said, \\"You don't need to be sadistic or foul-mouthed to write a good thriller, but you need exactly what Grisham lacks: a taste for cunning, meanness and grit. He sets up a big showdown only to walk away from it, and so the tension just dribbles off. Worse, Grisham's country-mouse attitude toward the big, bad city - where apartments rent for thousands of dollars a month and you can't find a good $3.99 blue-plate special at the local diner - is a drag. Who wants to reach for a thriller and wind up with Frank Capra?\\" Lev Grossman of Time said the novel \\"ticks along lightly and pleasantly — it's crafted and paced with the same signature glossy perfection that makes Grisham, book for book, probably the best-selling novelist in the world. It's just that it's not about anything. In fact it's amazing that anybody could put together a book that is this compulsively readable while at the same time being almost entirely devoid of substance of any kind . . . The Associate is as close to being about nothing as a book can be — it's a masterpiece of almost ghostly narrative minimalism, a book of names without characters, a book with plot points but no plot. There's something comforting about the meaningless hindbrain tension that The Associate generates in the reader — empty tension, the kind where there's nothing genuine at stake. Comforting too is the cozy quaintness of Grisham's little world. It's supposed to be a scary place, in theory, full of brooding criminals and impossible choices, but it's really a relic of the American past, one as sentimental and archaic as a Norman Rockwell painting . . . The Associate is high-calorie comfort food, a thriller that doesn't actually thrill.\\" Joshua Rozenberg of The Observer said, \\"Suffice it to say that The Associate bears many similarities to The Firm, even down to the two dust jackets, which both show shadowy young lawyers on the run. Plagiarism? No, because both books are by John Grisham. Those who believed, even for a moment, that I was suggesting impropriety will recognise this as the sort of false trail that Grisham uses to good effect . . . Though our hero believes himself to be in the clear, he goes along with the blackmailers' demands. The reader screams at him to call their bluff, but that would ruin the story. So we suspend our disbelief. Then, just as we have got used to the idea, he changes his mind and sets about trapping the blackmailers after all. And that's it. The ending is curiously flat.\\" The Observer review References Category:2009 American novels Category:Legal thriller novels Category:Novels by John Grisham Category:American thriller novels Category:Doubleday (publisher) books ","title":"The Associate (novel)"},{"id":"18719932","text":"The District of Columbia Financial Control Board (officially the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority) was a five-member body established by the United States Congress in 1995 to oversee the finances of District of Columbia Created through the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995, the board had the power to override decisions by District of Columbia's mayor and district council. It suspended its activities on September 30, 2001, when the District achieved its fourth consecutive balanced budget.Board website, archived 2001-10-09. History The District attained limited home rule in 1973 and was for many years financially stable. But the combination of federally imposed budget limitations and requirements, \\"white flight\\", inadequate federal support, the recession of the early 1990s, the urban crack epidemic and poor local management were too much for the city to handle and in 1994 the District began operating at a deficit. The next year the accumulated deficit had ballooned to $722 million and Wall Street dropped the District's bond rating to \\"junk\\" status creating the perception that lending to the District was risky. Without the ability to borrow, the District couldn't pay its bills. The District's economic crisis came to the attention of the Clinton administration and the new Republican Congress. In 1995, they began to consider two options. Option one was to place the city in federal receivership, not unlike the commissioner structure prior to home rule, a move favored by some of the newly elected congressional Republicans and almost no one in the District. Option two was to create a control board which would have some control over the city's affairs. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), the District’s non-voting representative to Congress, supported the control board. She knew that jurisdictions such as New York, Cleveland and Philadelphia had emerged from financial crisis with the assistance of state- created financial control boards, and that those jurisdictions had retained partial autonomy during the control periods and received full autonomy once the control period had ended. Working with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep. Tom Davis, the new chair of the D.C. subcommittee, Norton convinced Congress to pass legislation in 1995 (the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995) creating the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority – or as it was commonly known: the “Control Board.” The Control Board had broad powers traditionally reserved for the city government and responsibility for balancing the District's budget. It could approve or reject the city’s annual budget, its financial plan, and any attempts to spend or borrow in the city’s name. It could review all future and existing city contracts. The Board was expected to approve the Mayor’s appointments to key government positions, including the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and had the authority to remove such appointees for cause. The Control Board also could disapprove District laws passed by the Council. Congress gave the Control Board four years to balance the District’s budget – a balance that was required to be maintained for four years before the Control Board could be dissolved. The board took several steps to balance the District's budget. It reviewed 1500 contracts and rejected millions of dollars in contracts to the Mayor's associates. It took contracting authority away from the Department of Human Services. It made funding decisions and overturned others. It even fired the public school superintendent and hired its own. Meanwhile the city began to reduce the payroll and cut welfare benefits and youth programs. However, these changes only made a modest change in the District's financial situational, because the problems went far beyond local mismanagement. The problems that caused the District's financial crisis had much more to do with its unique status and were beyond the control board's ability to repair. The District was required to fund many state functions as if it possessed the broad taxing base of a state, most notably Medicaid, welfare, public schools, roads, courts, hospitals, prisons and a university. But, it wasn't always given the same funding as states. For example, the District government was forced to educate the city’s youth without nearly $300 million in operational funding it would have received were it part of a state. Furthermore, when the District attained home rule, it inherited $2 billion in unfunded pension liability, which had been accumulated entirely by the Federal Government. By 1997, that $2 billion unfunded pension liability had grown to $5 billion, almost entirely as a function of interest. On the taxing side, the District was barred from taxing non-residents - a so-called \\"commuter tax\\"; it could not assess property taxes to 43% of the District's land, either because it was federally owned or because Congress had immunized their owners (including foreign embassies and consulates, international organizations, and the headquarters of such national organizations as the American Legion and the Daughters of the American Revolution); and the federally-mandated height limit stunted growth of the tax base. When originally given home rule, the federal government set up a system to compensate the District for its unique issues. However that payment, $660 million in 1997, was inadequate based on the federal government's own system for calculating what it should be. So, in 1996, the Control Board released a report calling for a change in the relationship with the federal government. This led to the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 (known as “The Revitalization Act”). The Revitalization Act removed several costly state functions such as the criminal justice and tax collection systems; provided debt relief; and relieved the District of its massive, federally created pension liability and disproportionate share of Medicaid payments. It also provided additional funding for infrastructure and economic development. In return, it ended the federal payment and created additional federal oversight (the Faircloth Attachment). It did not touch limitations on revenue, such as the commuter tax ban, property tax exemptions or the federal height limitations on buildings. The Control Board and District Government, working with the benefits of the Revitalization Act, were able to balance the District's budget and wind down the Board. Shortly after the election of the new Mayor, former Chief Financial Officer Anthony Williams, on November 3, 1998, Dr. Alice Rivlin, chair of the Control Board voluntarily relinquished control of the agencies Congress assigned to the Board, thus restoring home rule. Congress also followed suit, passing the District of Columbia Management Restoration Act of 1999, which repealed the Faircloth Attachment. By 2001, the city had balanced five consecutive budgets (each with a surplus), restored its access to capital markets and improved bond rating, and repaid all advances made by the U.S. Treasury during the early Control Period years. This financial progress enabled the Control Board to dissolve a year earlier than scheduled, which it did on September 30, 2001. Board members * Alice M.

Typhoon Fung-wong reached peak intensity of a Category 2 typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center with peak winds of . Damage was extensive in Taiwan, hitting little more than a week later than Typhoon Kalmaegi, but a specific cost is unknown, though later estimated at 541 million (2008 USD). Meteorological history On July 20, 2008, a tropical disturbance formed to the south-east of Okinawa, Japan. Later that day the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, started to issue tropical weather outlooks on the disturbance. At this time the JTWC assessed its chances of forming into a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as \\"Poor\\". Over the next few days as the disturbance slowly moved south west the JTWC kept assessing the disturbance chances of forming into a significant tropical cyclone as poor due to the disturbance's transition from a cold core to a warm core. Late on July 23 the JTWC upgraded the disturbances chances of becoming a significant tropical cyclone to fair. This came after the Japan Meteorological Agency had designated the disturbance as a minor tropical depression. Early the next day the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the disturbance as a tropical depression and assigned the local name of Igme to the depression. Later that morning the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as they upgraded the disturbance's chances of becoming a significant tropical cyclone to \\"Good\\". At the same time the JMA designated the depression as a full tropical depression. Later that day the JTWC upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression and designated it as 09W. During the morning of July 25 both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, with the JMA assigning the name Fung-wong to the storm. During that day Fung-wong intensified slowly with the JMA reporting early the next day that Fungwong had become a severe tropical storm. Later on July 26 the JTWC upgraded Fungwong to typhoon status, whilst the JMA were reporting that Fung-wong was still a severe tropical storm. The next morning the JMA upgraded Fung-wong to typhoon status, and then later that day reported that Fung-wong had reached its 10-minute peak wind speeds of , (85 mph, 140 km/h). Fung-wong also reached its 1-minute sustained peak wind speeds of , (110 mph, 175 km/h) which made Fung-wong a category two typhoon as it moved towards Taiwan. Late on July 27 Fungwong made landfall on Taiwan near the border of Hualien County and Taitung County. Early the next day, as Fungwong moved towards the west through Taiwan, the JMA downgraded Fungwong to a severe tropical storm as it moved through Changhua County towards the Taiwan Strait. Fung-wong then moved into the Taiwan Strait later that morning, before being downgraded that afternoon to a Tropical Storm by the JTWC. Fungwong then made its second landfall, this time on south-east China. Later that day the JTWC issued its final advisory on Fung-wong, as the JTWC expected Fung-wong to dissipate over land during the next 12 hours. However the JMA continued to issue advisories on Fung-wong as it moved across China downgrading it to a Tropical Storm early on July 29. The JMA then kept issuing advisories on Fung- wong until early that afternoon when they downgraded Fung-wong to a tropical depression and issued their final advisory. However the JMA kept issuing warnings on the depression until it dissipated the next day. Preparations Typhoon Fung-wong approaching Taiwan on July 27 Taiwan On July 27, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau issued land and sea advisories for the entire main island of Taiwan. In advance of the storm's arrival in Taiwan, both Hualien County and Taitung County in eastern Taiwan called off work and classes both for the evening of July 27 as well as all day on July 28. All local governments in Taiwan proper, as well as the island county of Penghu in the Taiwan Strait have called off work and school for the 28th. Several airlines have cancelled all domestic flights for the 28th as has some international flights from Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, and Taichung. The Taiwan Railways Administration cancelled all trains running the eastern Taiwan line for the evening of the 27th and all trains nationwide where shut down until 17:00 local time (0900 UTC) on the 28th.

Impact=Taiwan Typhoon Fung-wong over Taiwan on July 28 As Fung-wong tracked over Taiwan, roughly 359,036 households lost power, 13,034 lost their water supply and 17,361 lost telephone service. The heaviest rainfall was recording on Tai-Ping Mountain in Yilian County at 818 mm (32.2 in). During the storm, officials evacuated 1,236 people from numerous locations which were considered to be in life-threatening situations. Mainland China Fung-wong brought heavy rains to mainland China, peaking at in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province. Up to was estimated to have fallen across Fujian Province, leading to two locals rivers overflowing. The JTWC reported that the typhoon, as a tropical storm made its second landfall over mainland China on July 28, 1500 UTC, around south of Fuzhou. Xinhua News Agency, however, reported the storm making landfall at 10 pm local time (1400 UTC). Fujian Province was hard hit, receiving gusting winds of up to 155 km/h. 338,000 people were evacuated, and casualties are one dead and six injured. Damages in Fujian provence totaled to 503 million yuan ($73 million). Fung- wong destroyed 8,667 homes and damaged 38,300 others. An estimated of farmland were also lost.

Migration history The first Korean immigrants to Uruguay were ten families, totalling 45 persons, admitted in March 1975 to work in the agricultural sector. However, most of them later emigrated to Argentina and Paraguay. Since 1980, a total of 140 Koreans have naturalised as Uruguayan citizens, although many are not resident in the country any longer. The population is transient and fluctuates in size; the peak months of Korean presence in Uruguay are June, July, November, and December. Employment Most Koreans live in and around Montevideo, where some work as fishermen, while others are involved in the textile industry. The fishermen are almost all from Busan; they earn between US$1,000 and US$1,500 a month, while the engineers on their boats receive US$3,000-4,000 and the captain may make as much as US$6,000. The fishermen often work in dangerous conditions and face language barriers. In February 2007, three Korean fishermen were killed in an explosion on board a fishing boat, along with their Vietnamese colleague. There are several Korean-run restaurants and noraebang (karaoke bars) in Montevideo. As of 2013, there are 15 South Korean citizens registered in the Uruguayan social security. Religion South Korean missionaries of the Church of the Brethren, a Protestant denomination, have been evangelising among Korean fishermen in Uruguay for almost 20 years. One of their earliest converts from among the fishermen, Simon Lee, eventually left the fishing industry to devote himself to religious work; in 2004, he and ten others established a Korean church in Montevideo, which also aimed to serve fishermen from other Asian countries as well.

It was one of the first successful Japanese-language RPGs, having sold 150,000 copies, and helped familiarize the Japanese public with RPGs. It was originally released for the NEC PC-8801, and ported to several other platforms. The Famicom version featured completely redesigned gameplay, a new map, and was retitled Super Black Onyx (スーパーブラックオニキス). The Game Boy Color port was developed by Atelier Double and published by Taito. The Game Boy Color port added enhanced visuals and included an option to play through the game with the original game's visual style. Because of memory limitations, another part of the game was released separately on some platforms as (which added a magic system). Two other parts were announced, (which allowed the party to explore the wilderness), and (which allowed the party to take part in Arena battles). The SG-1000 version was one of the last releases for that console, succeeded by Portrait of Loretta. Gameplay The player can create a five-member party (4 members on GBC), or can ask friendly encounters to join the party to fill empty slots. The party will explore the dungeons under the town of Utsuro (ウツロ) to obtain the legendary Black Onyx. Doing so will break the curse which binds the town in eternal night. The combat system has no concept of distance, so there are no bows or similar missile weapons. There are melee weapons, shields, and armor, however. The hospital in town can offer \\"examinations\\" which display the PCs' stats. There is a bank in town where the heroes can deposit money. This protects money from thieves; but there is no interest on the deposits, since there is no time system. The labyrinth under the town has several entrances, each hidden in one of the locations of the town. The labyrinth has six floors corresponding to the six colors the computer can display. These must be solved in the proper order (which depends on the platform) in order to create the stairway to the Black Tower, where the Onyx resides.  Legacy  An English-language fan-translation was made available for the SG-1000 version by back-porting from the abandoned source files for a similar hobby conversion project for the ColecoVision system. Another group later used those same source files to complete the project and released an unofficial English-language ColecoVision game in 2013. The Black Onyx was adapted as a manga titled , published in the Gamest Comics collection from April 1999, drawn by Kouta Hirano.

History  In the early 1930s, Otter Cliffs Radio Station on Mount Desert Island was literally falling apart. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., then developing the infrastructure of Acadia National Park, sought to locate the park's main loop road through the Otter Cliffs area. The Navy was willing to meet Rockefeller halfway on the removal of the radio station from Otter Cliffs, agreeing to relocate if a suitable site could be found on the coast within of Otter Cliffs. Big Moose Island, at the tip of Schoodic Peninsula about across the mouth of Frenchman Bay from Otter Cliffs, was determined to be an ideal location for the relocated radio station, and agreement was reached between the Navy, Interior Department, and Rockefeller for the relocation. Rockefeller, wishing the station's buildings to be compatible with others designed for the park, retained Grosvenor Atterbury, the New York architect who designed the park's gatehouses, to come up with plans for the radio station. Atterbury's plan for the new station included a beautiful residence hall similar to Mr. Rockefeller's residence at Seal Harbor. Artisans from all over the world contributed to the project. This building, and the adjacent power station which was also designed by Atterbury, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. On 28 February 1935, the U.S. Navy Radio and Direction Finding Station Winter Harbor was officially commissioned with Chief Radioman Max Gunn in charge of a complement of 11 personnel. The station's name has changed several times over the years. In 1944, it was changed to Supplementary Radio Station, U.S. Naval Radio Station Winter Harbor. In 1950, it became known as U.S. Naval Radio Station (Receiver). The present station name, Naval Security Group Activity, Winter Harbor, became official on 9 June 1958. In 2001, the base transitioned from an operational posture to focusing on the closure process, with the ultimate goal of transferring the Schoodic parcel to the National Park Service. The last System Maintenance Training Course graduated in July 2001. The AN/FRD-10 Wullenweber Antenna and Classic Wizard antennas came down in August. The last service was held at the Chapel 2 September 2001, and the Foc'sle Galley served its last meal on 28 September 2001.  Redevelopment  After the base was closed in 2002,\\"The Navy at Schoodic Point\\" (archive). schoodicinstitute.org. Schoodic Institute at Acadia National Park.

The SERC campus is managed by the nonprofit Schoodic Institute and the NPS in a public-private partnership as one of 19 NPS research learning centers in the country. The center is dedicated to supporting scientific research in the park, providing professional development for teachers, and educating students who will become the next generation of park stewards.\\"Schoodic Institute - Mission & History\\" (archive). schoodicinstitute.org.

In the mathematical subject of group theory, the rank of a group G, denoted rank(G), can refer to the smallest cardinality of a generating set for G, that is : \\\\operatorname{rank}(G)=\\\\min{ X: X\\\\subseteq G, \\\\langle X\\\\rangle =G}. If G is a finitely generated group, then the rank of G is a nonnegative integer. The notion of rank of a group is a group-theoretic analog of the notion of dimension of a vector space. Indeed, for p-groups, the rank of the group P is the dimension of the vector space P/Φ(P), where Φ(P) is the Frattini subgroup. The rank of a group is also often defined in such a way as to ensure subgroups have rank less than or equal to the whole group, which is automatically the case for dimensions of vector spaces, but not for groups such as affine groups. To distinguish these different definitions, one sometimes calls this rank the subgroup rank. Explicitly, the subgroup rank of a group G is the maximum of the ranks of its subgroups: : \\\\operatorname{sr}(G)=\\\\max_{H \\\\leq G} \\\\min{ X: X \\\\subseteq H, \\\\langle X \\\\rangle = H }. Sometimes the subgroup rank is restricted to abelian subgroups. Known facts and examples *For a nontrivial group G, we have rank(G) = 1 if and only if G is a cyclic group. The trivial group T has rank(T) = 0, since the minimal generating set of T is the empty set. *For a free abelian group \\\\mathbb Z^n we have {\\\\rm rank}(\\\\mathbb Z^n)=n. *If X is a set and G = F(X) is the free group with free basis X then rank(G) = X. *If a group H is a homomorphic image (or a quotient group) of a group G then rank(H) ≤ rank(G). *If G is a finite non- abelian simple group (e.g. G = An, the alternating group, for n > 4) then rank(G) = 2. This fact is a consequence of the Classification of finite simple groups. *If G is a finitely generated group and Φ(G) ≤ G is the Frattini subgroup of G (which is always normal in G so that the quotient group G/Φ(G) is defined) then rank(G) = rank(G/Φ(G)).D.

The problem asks, for a particular class of finitely presented groups if there exists an algorithm that, given a finite presentation of a group from the class, computes the rank of that group. The rank problem is one of the harder algorithmic problems studied in group theory and relatively little is known about it. Known results include: *The rank problem is algorithmically undecidable for the class of all finitely presented groups. Indeed, by a classical result of Adian–Rabin, there is no algorithm to decide if a finitely presented group is trivial, so even the question of whether rank(G)=0 is undecidable for finitely presented groups.W.

Generalizations and related notions The rank of a finitely generated group G can be equivalently defined as the smallest cardinality of a set X such that there exists an onto homomorphism F(X) → G, where F(X) is the free group with free basis X. There is a dual notion of co-rank of a finitely generated group G defined as the largest cardinality of X such that there exists an onto homomorphism G → F(X).

Life His father was a wealthy master-cutler. He was educated at Sedgley Park School, St Mary's College, Oscott, and Ushaw College, where he became a priest in 1834. He was resident priest at Doncaster for five years, but his health having given way he travelled during eight years through Europe and the East. After his return home, 1847, he spent some time at Islington, London, working for the welfare of street children. He became a professed member of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer at St. Trond, Belgium, 1851, and afterwards gave missions in England and Ireland; but from 1851 until his death he devoted himself wholly to giving missions to children. He was the founder of children's missions and \\"the children's Mass\\", and by his writings systematized a philosophy of religious training. These missions lasted sometimes three weeks, and were given not only to school-children, but to working boys and girls. His maxim was that \\"nothing so disgusted children as monotony\\", and therefore he had the prayers at Mass and the Rosary sung to simple airs, and his sermons seldom lasted more than twenty minutes. Preaching quietly but with great dramatic power from a platform, he held their attention. He was a story-teller, seldom moving to laughter but often to tears. Works He spent his spare time writing books for children in simple language. His chief works are The Sunday-School Teacher and God and His creatures, which has been published in French. He wrote a scathing answer to an attack on his works by the Saturday Review. His writings were assailed as \\"infamous publications\\" by the rationalist historian William Edward Hartpole Lecky in his History of European Morals, chiefly on account of the somewhat lurid eschatology of the children's books. More than four millions of his booklets were sold.

It can assign sleep settings, schedule sleep and wake times, and display power information.  History  The \`pmset\` utility first appeared in Darwin 6.0.1 and Mac OS X 10.2 \\"Jaguar\\". It has been updated periodically since its introduction, and is still available as of Darwin 19.4 and macOS 10.15 \\"Catalina\\".  Behavior  The utility sets or lists power management settings. Some of the functionality provided by the utility is available through the GUI interface of the Energy Saver preference pane. However, \`pmset\` allows for greater flexibility and access to several options not available in the GUI. The utility can set different power management settings depending on usage scenario. Different settings can be applied for when the machine is running off a charger, battery, UPS, or all three. The appropriate flags are as follows: * \`-c\` (charger), adjust settings used while connected to a charger * \`-b\` (battery), adjust settings used when running off a battery * \`-u\` (UPS), adjust settings used when running off a UPS * \`-a\` (all, default) adjust settings for all scenarios Additional arguments be supplied when assigning any power management settings. Power management arguments are discussed in greater detail below. When invoking the command, only specified arguments modify power management options. Any arguments already set will be unmodified by \`pmset\` unless those arguments are specifically included. The utility can schedule wake, sleep, power on or power off events. Events can be recurring based on arbitrary weekday and time combinations, or scheduled for future dates and times. The syntax for scheduling an event is as follows: : \`pmset [repeat, schedule] [sleep, wake, poweron, shutdown, wakeorpoweron] [ ] \` Previously stored events will be overwritten upon running this command. To schedule multiple events they must be entered in one command string. For example, to set a shutdown event every day of the week at 23:59 and a wake or power on event every day of the week at 7:00 enter the following: : \`sudo pmset repeat shutdown MTWRFSU 23:59:00 wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 7:00:00\` The get flag displays information about the current power management configuration, or a log of recent activity. If no additional arguments are supplied the flag will only display current settings. Additional get arguments are discussed in greater detail below. The get flag is as follows: * \`-g\` get, list current power management settings To view the currently scheduled events type: : \`pmset -g sched \` The utility is also able to configure hibernation and safe sleep options, and change Energy Saver profiles.  Power management settings  The \`pmset\` utility recognizes the following arguments. Arguments can be passed in serial form in any order. Any bad syntax or unrecognized argument will cause the entire command to fail, resulting in an error message and brief help screen. Power management settings can only be changed by a privileged user. * \`displaysleep\` – display sleep timer in minutes, 0 to disable display sleep * \`disksleep\` – disk spin-down timer in minutes, 0 to disable disk sleep * \`sleep\` – system sleep timer in minutes, 0 to disable sleep * \`womp\` wake on \\"magic\\" Ethernet packet, 1 to enable or 0 to disable * \`hibernatemode\` change hibernation mode, 0 for RAM powered while sleeping; 1 for RAM contents written to disk and system totally unpowered; 3 for RAM both powered and written to disk; 5 is the same as mode 1, but for use with secure virtual memory; 7 is the same as mode 3, but for use with secure virtual memory; 25 for hibernation in Mac OS X 10.7, with RAM contents written to disk and system totally unpowered * \`hibernatefile\` change hibernation image file location; image may only be located on the root volume * \`ring\` wake on modem ring, 1 to enable or 0 to disable * \`autorestart\` automatic restart after loss of power, 1 to enable or 0 to disable * \`dps\` dynamically change processor speed based on load, 1 to enable or 0 to disable * \`reduce\` permanently reduce processor speed, 1 to enable or 0 to disable * \`powerbutton\` put the machine to sleep when the power button pressed instead of shutting it down, 1 to enable or 0 to disable * \`powernap\` unknown * \`lidwake\` (laptop only) wake the machine when the laptop lid is opened, 1 to enable or 0 to disable * \`acwake\` (laptop only) wake the machine when the power source is changed, such as when AC power is removed and the machine switches to battery power, 1 to enable or 0 to disable * \`lessbright\` (laptop only) slightly turn down display brightness when switching to a specified power source, 1 to enable or 0 to disable * \`halfdim\` display sleep will use an intermediate half-brightness state between full brightness and fully off, 1 to enable or 0 to disable * \`sms\` (supported laptops only) use Sudden Motion Sensor to park disk heads on sudden changes in G force, 1 to enable or 0 to disable * \`haltlevel\` (UPS only) UPS charge in percentage, shut down the machine when UPS reaches a specified charge level * \`haltafter\` (UPS only) UPS charge in minutes, shut down machine after drawing on UPS for specified number of minutes * \`haltremain\` (UPS only) UPS charge in minutes, shut down machine when specified time remains on UPS * \`ttyskeepawake\` prevent idle system sleep when any tty (such as a remote login session) is active; a tty is inactive only when its idle time exceeds the system sleep timer, 1 to enable or 0 to disable * \`autopoweroff\` (AC power) Where supported, enabled per default as an implementation of Lot 6 to the European Energy-related Products Directive. After sleeping for autopoweroffdelay minutes, the system will write a hibernation image and go into a lower power chipset sleep. Wakeups from this state will take longer than wakeups from regular sleep. The system will not auto power off if any external devices are connected, if the system is on battery power, or if the system is bound to a network and wake for network access is enabled. * \`autopoweroffdelay\` (AC power) delay before entering autopoweroff mode. (Value = integer, in seconds) * \`networkoversleep\` This setting affects how macOS networking presents shared network services during system sleep. This setting is not used by all platforms; changing its value is unsupported. * \`destroyfvkeyonstandby\` Destroy File Vault Key when going to standby mode. By default File vault keys are retained even when system goes to standby. If the keys are destroyed, user will be prompted to enter the password while coming out of standby mode. (value: 1 - Destroy, 0 - Retain). Since it is essential that the system fully powered down, you also need to set \`hibernatemode\` to 25 (suspend to disk). Settings may be adjusted independently for circumstances where the machine is attached to a charger, when running off a battery (in the case of a laptop), or when running off a UPS (if available). Settings can also be adjusted for all four scenarios simultaneously; this is the default option, for when no usage flag is specified. Power management options can be specified for different profiles by appending \`-c\` (charger), \`-b\` (battery), \`-u\` (UPS) or \`-a\` (all) flags. The following example will set the machine to sleep after 10 minutes and sleep the display after five minutes, but only when powered by the battery. :\`pmset -b sleep 10 displaysleep 5\` The following command will assign slightly different power management settings for circumstances where the machine is powered by the charger. Here, the machine is set to sleep after 30 minutes and the display is set to never sleep, but only when set by the charger. Issuing both commands will not interfere with each other. :\`pmset -c sleep 30 displaysleep 0\` Arguments can be entered in serial form to set or modify several power management parameters with one command. The following command will set the machine to never sleep (\`sleep 0\`), enable the Sudden Motion Sensor (\`sms 1\`), set the display to sleep after 20 minutes (\`displaysleep 20\`), disable processor speed reduction (\`reduce 0\`), enable intermediate display dimness (\`halfdim 1\`), enable the machine to wake when the lid is opened (\`lidwake 1\`), prevent the system from sleeping when a tty session (such as SSH) is active (\`ttyskeepawake 1\`), disable waking the machine when the AC adapter is inserted (\`acwake 0\`), disable an automatic restart after power is removed and restored (\`autorestart 0\`), enable dynamic change of processor speed based on system load (\`dps 1\`), enable wake on modem ring (\`ring 1\`), enable wake on receipt of \\"magic\\" Ethernet packet (\`womp 1\`), and disable hard disk sleep (\`disksleep 0\`): :\`pmset sleep 0 sms 1 displaysleep 20 reduce 0 halfdim 1 lidwake 1 ttyskeepawake 1 acwake 0 autorestart 0 dps 1 ring 1 womp 1 disksleep 0\` Because the above example did not include a usage flag, the settings specified will apply to all usage scenarios. Subsequent commands that do specify a usage flag will only affect settings for that usage scenario. For instance, \`pmset -b sleep 10\` will cause the machine to sleep after 10 minutes, but only when the battery is attached. All other settings will apply when the battery is attached, and all settings in the above example will apply when a charger or UPS is attached. At least as of Darwin 9.4 and OS X 10.5.4 \\"Leopard\\", all changes made through \`pmset\` are saved in a persistent preferences file at \`/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist\`. This file can be modified manually using the \`defaults\` command, but those changes will not be taken up immediately by the power management system. Manual edits of \`com.apple.PowerManagement.plist\` also stand the risk of being overwritten. The command \`pmset touch\` will reread existing settings from disk and apply them to the system. With \`autopoweroff\` enabled the machine will got into hibernate mode even if \`hibernatemode\` is 0. The value of \`autopoweroffdelay\` may be in seconds despite the man page (for Mavericks, Nov 9, 2012) documenting it as minutes.  Schedule Settings  The \`pmset\` command is able to schedule system sleep, shutdown, wakeup or power on events. The \`schedule\` argument is for setting up one-time power events, and \`repeat\` is for setting up daily or weekly events. Scheduling of events can only be done by a privileged user. The \`schedule\` argument recognizes the following additional arguments: * type; one of \`sleep\`, \`wake\`, \`poweron\`, \`shutdown\` or \`wakeorpoweron\` * date and time (schedule only); in the format \`\\"MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss\\"\`; must be in 24-hour format, must be in quotes * time (repeat only); in the format \`HH:mm:ss\`; must be in 24 format, but does not have to be in quotes * weekdays; a subset of \`MTWRFSU\` such as \`M\` or \`MTWRF\` are valid, as are strings \`weekdays\`, \`weekends\`, and \`everyday\` * owner; a string describing the person or program who is scheduling the power event (optional) The utility can be very unforgiving of improper syntax. Any errors in syntax will cause the command to fail and will display a brief help message. The syntax for a scheduled event is as follows: : \`pmset schedule [sleep, wake, poweron, shutdown, wakeorpoweron] \\"MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss\\"\` Only one type of event (sleep, wake, et cetera) can be specified, and the date chosen must be in the future. The utility expects to be able to store this information in the PMU, and so may not work reliably on non-Apple hardware. The date and time string must be enclosed in quotation marks. The syntax for a repeating event is as follows: : \`pmset repeat [sleep, wake, poweron, shutdown, wakeorpoweron] [MTWRFSU, weekdays, weekends, everyday] HH:mm:ss\` Scheduled wake, sleep and power events are stored in a persistent preferences file in \`/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.AutoWake.plist\`. This file can be manually edited using the \`defaults\` command, but any changes so made stand a serious risk of being overwritten. Also, such edits will not be immediately taken up by the system.  List Options  The list flag, \`-g\`, displays information about the current power configuration. The flag alone, with no additional arguments, will display current power management settings. Additional arguments will display more specific information. The get functions of \`pmset\` do not require privileged access. The utility recognizes the following arguments (an up-to-date list can be retrieved with the undocumented \`pmset -g getters\` command, though it does not show all \`*log\` variants): * \`live\` like \`-g\` with no option, displays the settings currently in use * \`custom\` will display custom settings for all power sources, although these settings may not currently be in use * \`cap\` capabilities, display which power management features the machine supports * \`sched\` schedule, display scheduled startup, wake, shutdown and sleep events * \`ups\` will display UPS emergency thresholds * \`ac\` or \`adapter\` will display details about an attached AC power adapter. Only supported for MacBook and MacBook Pro. * \`ps\` or \`batt\` power source, display status of connected batteries and UPSs * \`accps\` will display details of power sources for accessories * \`pslog\` display an ongoing log of power source state * \`rawlog\` display an ongoing log of power source state as read directly from battery * \`rawbatt\` display battery state * \`therm\` shows thermal conditions (not on all platforms) * \`thermlog\` show an ongoing log of thermal notifications (not on all platforms) * \`assertions\` displays the summary of current power assertions (10.6 and later) * \`assertionslog\` displays an ongoing log of power assertions (10.6 and later) * \`sysload\` displays the system load advisory (10.6 and later) * \`useractivity\` show current user activity status * \`useractivitylog\` show an ongoing log of user activity events * \`log\` show a history log of events * \`history\` show a timeline of events for debugging * \`historydetailed\` show driver-level timings for the UUID of a history event * \`hidnull\` show status of * \`userclients\` display a list of processes accepting/sending events * \`uuid\` display the currently active sleep/wake UUID * \`rtc\` display raw RTC data * \`getters\` display a list of valid options for \`-g\` * \`powerstate\` display the current power state of all device drivers * \`stats\` display the sleep/wake statistics * \`systemstate\` display the current power state and the system's power capabilities * \`everything\` display everything Only one get argument can be passed to \`pmset -g\`. For instance, to display scheduled events, type \`pmset -g sched\`. The utility will not return an error if more than one get argument is provided, but all other than the first will be ignored. The \`sleep\` and \`displaysleep\` can show an imposed value of 0 (disabled) together with a list of process IDs that impose this value. These are processes such as backup programs which need the machine to stay awake, for example until the backup is finished.  Sample usage  The following examples demonstrate the output of the \`pmset\` command on an Apple PowerBook G4 running Mac OS X 10.5.4 \\"Leopard\\". The following example will put the relevant computer to sleep immediately: pmset sleepnow The following example will apply only to laptops when powered by the battery. It will set the machine to sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity, put the display to sleep after 2 minutes, and spin down the hard disk after 3 minutes. Only privileged users can issue this command. If the command is issued successfully and is without syntax errors, \`pmset\` will exit silently with an exit code of 0. To verify that the system took the new configuration, issue the command \`pmset -g\`. pmset -b sleep 5 displaysleep 2 disksleep 3 The following example will apply only to machines being powered by a UPS. It will set the machine to perform an emergency shutdown when 5 percent battery remains on the UPS, or 5 minutes estimated draw time remains, whichever comes first. Only privileged users can issue this command. If the command is issued successfully and is without syntax errors, \`pmset\` will exit silently with an exit code of 0. To verify that the system took the new configuration, issue the command \`pmset -g\`. pmset -u haltlevel 5 haltremain 5 The following example will apply for all usage scenarios. It will set the machine to wake on receipt of a \\"magic\\" Ethernet packet, wake if the modem detects a ring, and prevent the system from sleeping if a tty session is active. Only privileged users can issue this command. If the command is issued successfully and is without syntax errors, \`pmset\` will exit silently with an exit code of 0. To verify that the system took the new configuration, issue the command \`pmset -g\`. pmset -a womp 1 ring 1 ttyskeepawake 1 The following example sets a one-time scheduled power event. The machine will be set to shut down 01/10/2009 at 10:00 PM (10 January 2009 – Note the US centric MM/DD/YYY time syntax). Only privileged users can issue this command. If the command is issued successfully and is without syntax errors, \`pmset\` will exit silently with an exit code of 0. To verify that the system took the new configuration, issue the command \`pmset -g sched\`. pmset schedule shutdown \\"01/10/2009 22:00:00\\" The following example sets a repeating power event. The machine will wake or power on every weekday at 8:00 AM. Only privileged users can issue this command. If the command is issued successfully and is without syntax errors, \`pmset\` will exit silently with an exit code of 0. To verify that the system took the new configuration, issue the command \`pmset -g sched\`. pmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRF 08:00:00 Here, example output from \`pmset -g\`. At the time, the machine was being powered by the charger, while simultaneously charging the battery. The command prints the current configuration. $ pmset -g Active Profiles: Battery Power -1 AC Power -1* Currently in use: sleep 0 sms 1 displaysleep 20 reduce 0 halfdim 1 lidwake 1 ttyskeepawake 1 acwake 0 autorestart 0 dps 1 ring 1 womp 1 disksleep 0 Here, example output from \`pmset -g sched\`. In this example, the machine has already been configured for a repeating event to start or wake up every weekday at 8:00 AM. The command prints the repeating event; note that the next such occurrence appears as a scheduled power event. $ pmset -g sched Repeating power events: wakepoweron at 8:00AM weekdays only Scheduled power events: [0] wakeorpoweron at 08/04/08 08:00:00 by Repeating Here, example output from \`pmset -g\`.

It purports to be the story of Jesus Christ, told autobiographically. Plot summary The novel employs first person story-telling from the perspective of Jesus. It stays nearly entirely true to the text of the four canonical gospels. Jesus tells his own story, from his birth to a teen-aged virgin named Mary to his execution by crucifixion at the hands of the Romans. Just as in the gospels, he is resurrected from the dead, and ascends to heaven. Critical reception Critical response to Mailer's novel was mixed. Jack Miles, writing for Commonweal, found the book \\"a quiet, sweet, almost wan little book, a kindly offering from a New York Jew to his wife's Bible Belt family.\\" He noted that there was \\"something undeniably impressive about the restraint\\" of the style that Mailer undertook in composing the novel. He concluded that the novel was neither one of Mailer's best works, nor would it stand out amongst the bibliography of books inspired by the life of Christ, but that it had received unfairly harsh reviews from other critics.\\"The Gospel According to the Son- Review\\", by Jack Miles, for Commonweal, 18 July 1997. Critics such as Reynolds Price, writing for The New York Times, pointed to a \\"lack of inventiveness\\", based upon the fact that Mailer took so few liberties with the biblical text. David Gelernter, writing for the National Review, cited the \\"sheer arrogance\\" of the very premise of Mailer's book. Yet he went on to agree with Miles that much of the criticism of the book had been \\"unfair.\\" Gelernter called the book \\"strikingly orthodox\\" in its basic view of the character of Christ.\\"The Gospel According to the Son\\" a review by David Gelernter, for National Review, 28 July 1997. Mailer had largely anticipated some of the savage reviews he would receive for the book. He noted in an interview with Bruce Weber of The New York Times, \\"The book will get a fair share of bad reviews, but that I take for granted. I call a fair share between 65 percent and 75 percent bad reviews.\\"\\"Yes, His New Book Is Biblical, but Don't Call Him God \\", by Bruce Weber, for The New York Times, 24 April 1997. Sales history On May 11, 1997, The Gospel According to the Son entered the New York Times Best Seller List at #13.New York Times Best Seller List, from Hawes.com, 11 May 1997. It peaked at #7 on May 25 of that year, and spent six weeks in the top 16.New York Times Best Seller List, from Hawes.com, 15 June 1997.

Born in Sheffield, Hofton began his career at Kiveton Park, before moving to Glossop via Worksop Town and Denaby United in April 1908. In July 1910, Hofton became Manchester United's first £1,000 signing, beating the previous club record of £700, which was spent on Alex Bell in 1903. However, despite his record price tag, it took Hofton seven months to make his United debut, appearing for the first time away to Newcastle United on 18 February 1911. He then left the club on a free transfer in May 1913. The First World War broke out just over a year later, but one year after its conclusion, in September 1919, Hofton re-signed for Manchester United. He continued to play for the club for two-and-a-half more years, amassing a total of 18 appearances for the club, before being sold to Denaby Main in February 1922.

Its most notable signing was Boogie Down Productions, and it released Boogie Down Productions' first singles, \\"South Bronx\\" (1986) and \\"The Bridge is Over\\" (1987), and the group's landmark debut album, Criminal Minded (1987). Other acts that recorded for the label included JVC Force, Cold Crush Brothers, Levi 167 and Jewel T. The label's output was a mix of new names and old pioneers, and documents a period in which self- assertive lyrics begin to detail street life even as the music moved from hardcore drum-machine-based tracks to the horns and drum sounds of sampler- based hip hop. B-Boy Records folded in 1988, though Nate Patrin of Pitchfork Media reports that, \\"both Allen and Kamarra have set about reviving the B-Boy Records name independently of each other, and there seems to have been a number of bridges burned between the two men.\\" Foundation B-Boy Records was founded by Jack Allen and William Kamarra in 1986, with one act on its roster. Allen, Kamarra, and Ray Wilson, calling themselves Rock Candy Records and Filmworks, advertised that a record label was seeking new musical talent in a newspaper. (Steve Huey of AllMusic reported rumors that it was seeking to establish a front for a pornography business.) The ad was answered by the then-unrecorded Boogie Down Productions, now the most famous of the acts that were to be associated with the label. By request, the group recorded an anti- drug song called \\"Crack Attack\\" and was signed to the newly formed B-Boy Records. The label's graffiti-style logo was designed by the group's lead emcee, KRS-One. Notable releases The first official B-Boy release was Boogie Down Productions' \\"South Bronx\\" (1986). A forcefully delivered oral history of hip hop written in response to MC Shan's \\"The Bridge.\\" It generated considerable New York interest and became part of hip hop history (see the Bridge Wars). Technically homeless, KRS-One was living in a meat freezer below the B-Boy Records offices during this period. \\"South Bronx\\" was characteristic of much of B-Boy's releases: noisy, minimalist hip hop driven by the drum machine rather than the sampler. The Brothers' \\"I Got Rhythm\\", Wax Master Torey's \\"Duck Season\\", Jewel T's \\"I Like It Loud\\" and Levi 167's \\"Something Fresh to Swing To\\" (all 1987) are further examples. By contrast, the same year's \\"Just Saying Fresh Rhymes\\" by Castle D relies on a relatively quiet percussive accompaniment based around the hi-hat, and a disorienting synth melody reminiscent today of G-funk. Other notable, but more sampler- influenced, 1987 releases include The Busy Boys' \\"Classical,\\" \\"Feel The Horns\\" by old school pioneers Cold Crush Brothers, and Sparky D's \\"Throwdown.\\" After its first album, the landmark Criminal Minded (1987), Boogie Down Productions was supposed to sign with Warner Bros. Records and the label folded soon afterward. According to writer Peter Shapiro, B-Boy's best release besides those by Boogie Down was Levi 167's aforementioned 1987 single. They did however have late success with \\"Strong Island\\" (1988) by JVC Force, which Shapiro calls \\"one of the most kinetic records in hip-hop history\\". After the murder of Scott La Rock, however, BDP ultimately signed with Jive Records. B-Boy Records’ discography is now controlled Traffic Entertainment Group, under exclusive license from Phase One Network Inc. Retrospectives A 2002 retrospective of the label, The Best of B-Boy Records, is available on Landspeed Records (not to be confused with Boogie Down Productions' 2001 compilation, Best of B-Boy Records, on the same label). In 2007 the two-disc B-Boy Records: The Archives Rare & Unreleased was released through Traffic Entertainment Group, the successor of LandSpeed. In 2008, again through Traffic, came a four-disc MP3 collection of the label's complete official output, B-Boy Records: The Masterworks, featuring short-lived B-Boy Records acts such as Soul Dimension, Incredible Two, Crazy 8 Posse and Wacky Rapper, as well as a late release from Spyder-D (of \\"Big Apple Rappin'\\" fame), and B Girls Live and Kicking (1987), a collection of B-Boy's female MCs (Sparky D, Five Star Moet, Baby Doll, and L.A. Star). Not on the release was that the group BDP was to produce \\"Gotta-Rock\\" (G-Supreme & K-Rakeem), but Scott La Rock was killed before any work was done. Nate Patrin, writing for Pitchfork, observes that in B-Boy's recordings, \\"you can divine the beginnings of independent, street-level hardcore rap lyricism during the key transitional point that shifted the dominant production style from the 808 drum machine to the SP1200 sampler.\\" He describes the label's roster as \\"a dizzying array of past icons, future legends, coulda-beens, never-weres and more than a few acts you probably haven't heard of that caught lightning in a bottle for one 12\\" record\\".

He commanded the Ukrainian troops in the Far East (1918–1924). In January 1918 he arrived in Chita, and later traveled to Kharbin, where he came under the command of General Khorvat. From March 8 to November 14, 1918 he held the position of Chief of Staff of the Russian troops guarding the right-of-way of the Chinese Eastern Railway. In this position, at the beginning of summer 1918, Khreschatytsky began forming the Ukrainian army of the Green Ukraine (Zeleny Klyn). However, when forming the second Ukrainian division, he received an order from Admiral Alexander Kolchak in September 1918 — to send Ukrainian units to an anti- bolshevist front. From November 1918 until August 1919 Khreschatytsky served Kolchak's army, participating in fighting against Soviet Russia and rising to the rank of lieutenant-general. By autumn 1919 he had become inspector of the Far-Eastern formations of strategic reserve and general on the special commissions at commander by the troops of the Priamur's territorial department. In 1920 Khreschatytsky came under the command of ataman Grigory Semyonov. From April 27, 1920 and to July 7, 1921 he held the position of Chief of Staff of the Cossack troops of the Far East. At the beginning of 1920 (according to other sources - by the summer of 1918) the Ukrainian regional government appointed Khreschatytsky as commander of the Far-Eastern Ukrainian army. He supported the ideas of ataman G.M. Semyonov on the creation of a single state of Kazaks and Ukrainians in the Far East from Lake Baikal to the Pacific Ocean. From June 26, 1920 there was a manager by the department of foreign affairs of the Zabaykal's government of Semyonov and he negotiated with the Japanese about a joint fight against Red Army. From August, 1921 Khreschatytsky participated in the work of the Supreme Military Soviet of the Zabaykal. After the defeat of the troops (the Far Eastern Army) of General Semyonov and the disbanding in 1920 of the Ukrainian regiments of General L. V. Verigo in Vladivostok, Khreschatytsky emigrated to Kharbin in Manchuria.

Its sequel, billed as Newport 69, was held in Northridge, California, on June 20–22, 1969, and had a total attendance estimated at 200,000. History There were two separate events staged in the late 1960s that are commonly referred to as the \\"Newport Pop Festival.\\" The first was called the Newport Pop Festival — no relation to the folk or jazz festivals in Rhode Island — was as held at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa, California, on the weekend of August 3–4, 1968. The second event was originally billed as \\"Newport 69,\\" and was held over the three-day weekend of June 20–22, 1969 in Northridge, California, at Devonshire Downs. In published writings over the last 40 years, this latter event has been referred to as the \\"Newport 69 Pop Festival,\\" the \\"Newport Pop Festival 1969\\" or simply the \\"Newport Pop Festival.\\" Subsequently, much confusion has been created over the years between the 1968 and 1969 events. Some of this confusion was generated by the participating musicians themselves who, in later interviews, often mixed up the two events. The latter event was organized by Mark Robinson (age 25), who was one of the three promoters of the original Newport Pop Festival in 1968. The other two promoters of the '68 event were Gary R. Schmidt (age 26) and his father Al Schmidt. Al was not a rock 'n' roller, but rather an entrepreneurial businessman who helped with the money and licensing. There was a brief lawsuit between the two Schmidts and Robinson just prior to the \\"Newport 69\\" show, which the Schmidts had declined to be involved in because of the cost of the acts. Robinson reportedly spent $282,000 for the acts. The entire band budget for the '68 show was under $50,000, while Robinson paid Jimi Hendrix alone $100,000 for the '69 event. This was an amount of money unheard of at that time for a rock act. The lawsuit was over trade names and, within the last few days before the '69 show, the court ordered that Robinson had to use \\"not affiliated with the Newport Pop Festival\\" disclaimers in advertising. Otherwise, he would not have been able to stage a \\"Newport 70\\" show using that name. A round flyer with the dimensions of a 45RPM record was used to promote the 1968 Costa Mesa show and is included in \\"The Art of Rock,\\" a publication of 1960s and 1970s poster art. This flyer has sold on eBay for as much as $500. The Newport Pop Festival 1968 The first Newport Pop Festival was held at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa, California, on the weekend of August 3–4, 1968. It is believed to have been the first pop music concert with over 100,000 paid attendees. The 1968 event was originally scheduled to be held inside the Orange County Fairgrounds in an outdoor pavilion. The fairgrounds are on Newport Boulevard, just a short distance from Newport Beach (hence the name). The 1968 event's advance ticket sales were triple of what was expected, and it became evident that no area inside the fairgrounds could hold even 25,000 people, let alone the near 100,000 now predicted. In the last three days before the show, it was moved to one of the adjoining parking lots of the fairgrounds. Fencing, staging, sanitation, and food concessions had to be organized within just three days. Fencing in some areas consisted of wire blankets and/or tarps thrown over as a visual block. People without tickets on the outside would \\"storm the fence\\" and got in for free. None of the commercial concessionaires were prepared for the event, and they all ran out of food and drink halfway through the first day. Water was provided throughout the event by garden hoses from inside the fairgrounds, but attendees had to provide their own containers and give up their viewing spot to reach the water. A broken water supply pipe provided a mud bath that a number of people jumped in, but people realized that the sun would bake the mud into a hard cover, so they stopped. There were plenty of porta-potties available at the rear of the hastily assembled \\"grounds.\\" There was no shade in the primary viewing area, and partiers were sunburned. The weather was a typical August day in sunny Southern California. Those without hotel reservations had no place to stay. However, city officials alleviated some of the problems by designating a area of the fairgrounds as an emergency campsite. They also brought in portable toilets and water tanks. This particular event launched some of the problems rock festival promoters would face in the future. Harvey \\"Humble Harve\\" Miller, a Top 40 disc jockey for 93 KHJ-AM in Los Angeles, was hired to promote the show and hosted the event with Wavy Gravy. Wesco Productions (West Coast Productions) consisted of Mark Robinson, Gary Schmidt and Al Schmidt, though Humble Harv was used in advertising for promotional purposes. Tom Neito of Scenic Sounds Productions also assisted in securing the fairgrounds, and was paid a fee and received some promotional billing. Robinson had been involved with Bob Blodget in staging a much smaller but similar weekend festival in 1967 in Los Angeles.Gary Schmidt, rock promoter and pop festival organizer extraordinare - Susan Evans, Associate Editor Tahoe Reader - June 1991 There never was a second edition of this event and its prominence faded from memory until, on August 4, 2008, Jeff Overley penned a feature article for the Orange County Register that commemorated the event's 40th anniversary. The big hits with the crowd included Tiny Tim, Jefferson Airplane, Country Joe McDonald, The Chambers Brothers, and Steppenwolf. Mark Robinson went on to promote a similar \\"Newport 69\\" show with Jimi Hendrix and later became an attorney, practicing law with Melvin Belli. Al and Gary teamed up with Bill Quarry, Alfie Zaner and Rich Romello and produced the San Francisco International Pop Festival at the Alameda County Fairgrounds in Pleasanton on October 25–26, 1968. That show drew over 40,000 people and featured Creedence Clearwater Revival, the Chambers Brothers, José Feliciano, Deep Purple, Procol Harum, Johnny Rivers, Iron Butterfly, Eric Burdon and the Animals, Canned Heat, The Grass Roots, Rejoice, and Fraternity of Man. After the show, Al Schmidt continued in non rock 'n' roll business until he died at 83 in the late 1990s. Gary Schmidt entered the nightclub business and continued to promote smaller events throughout Northern California, including two more festivals with attendance in the 25,000–30,000 range: The Labor Day Weekend Music and Arts Festival in Carson City, Nevada in 1972 and Super Sun Bust Summer of 1973 at the Eugene Speedway (Oregon). For some of these productions, Schmidt teamed up with Bill Quarry, a well known early East Bay promoter (see \\"Teens N Twenties\\" and \\"The East Bay Scene, Garage Bands from the '60s, Then and Now\\"). Schmidt also operated a well-known rock nightclub, the Odyssey Room, in Sunnyvale, California, from 1969 to 1989 (see Odyssey Room Revisited) and a venue just outside Reno, Nevada on Mt. Rose called the Reindeer Lodge which, as of 2010, still hosts occasional shows. Mark Robinson, at the time a Stanford student, promoted a few more concerts and then finished law school. He is now a nationally renowned and accredited attorney, practicing law throughout the United States while keeping a home office in Orange County. The 1968 event attracted much media attention at the time. Rolling Stone Magazine published an article on the event in its September 14, 1968 edition, writing: Newport Pop Festival Drags on in Dust and Heat: Dead, Country Joe, Crosby, pie fight weekend's highlights Although not listed, Eric Burden introduced a local Long Beach,CA band WAR. Among other highlights that concert-goers recall were when helicopters flew overhead, dropping flowers on the audience. And on Sunday, Sonny and Cher arrived by helicopter and were later booed off the stage.Readers reminisce about Newport Pop Festival of 1968 - Orange County Register, Santa Ana, California, August 8, 2008 Bands performing at the Festival: Saturday, August 3, 1968 Alice Cooper, Canned Heat, The Chambers Brothers, the Charles Lloyd Quartet, Country Joe and the Fish, The Electric Flag, James Cotton Blues Band, Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Sonny & Cher, Steppenwolf, Tiny Tim. During the Charles Lloyd Quartet set, a local group called Super Chief began playing a Lee Michaels song, \\"Hello,\\" on an alternate stage at the rear of the crowd. Most of the attendees turned around and watched them, as the Lloyd music was not in a popular style. Sunday, August 4, 1968 Blue Cheer, Eric Burdon & the Animals, Grateful Dead, Illinois Speed Press, Iron Butterfly, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, The Byrds, Things to Come. Bands that may have performed at the festival Lovin' Spoonful, Rhinoceros, Sky Pilot and The Turtles were not listed on the official poster for the event, but there is published evidence indicating these bands may have played at the festival. The 1969 festival was intended to be the successor to the Orange County event, hoping to capitalize on the brand name and market momentum generated in 1968. A move of venue was necessary because the 1968 event had fallen in disfavor with local community leaders. Three days after the 1968 event, the Costa Mesa City Council vowed to prevent a Newport Pop Festival encore. \\"To say that we would not like it back here would be the understatement of the year,\\" said Costa Mesa Mayor Alvin Pinkley.40 years later, Newport Pop Festival reverberates - Orange County Register, Santa Ana, California, August 4, 2008 The \\"Newport 69\\" Festival Attended by an estimated 200,000 fans on June 20–22, 1969, this festival was the largest pop concert up to that time and is considered the more famous of the two Newport Pop Festivals, possibly because of the appearance of the top- billed Jimi Hendrix Experience.Roderick, Kevin. \\"Hendrix at Devonshire Downs\\".

Due to $50,000 in damages done to neighborhood homes and businesses, an investigation was launched by the Los Angeles police commission. Gatecrashers trespassed the hurricane fencing instead of paying the admission cost ($6 a day in advance, $7 at the gate, $15 in advance for the three days). Outside the festival, teenagers threw bottles and rocks, and damaged property. Traffic to and from Devonshire Downs was nearly impassible and parking was limited, so thousands parked in residential neighborhoods.

It uses a leaf shutter rather than the more common (in SLR cameras) focal plane shutter. This is a Synchro-Compur shutter mounted behind the lens, which is interchangeable. The shutter speeds go from \\"B\\" to 1/500. The most common lenses found on the Bessamatic are the Color-Lanthar, Color-Skopar, and Color-Skopar X all of which are 50mm focal length f/2.8 although the 50mm f/2 Septon is also fitted to these cameras, and is highly prized. The 35mm Skoparex is unusual, but not hard to find. The 135mm f/4 Super-Dynarex is relatively common, although the 200mm and 350mm Super-Dynarex lenses are relatively rare and expensive. The Bessamatic was the first SLR to be fitted with a zoom lens, the Zoomar. This is a highly sought after collectible and is quite expensive. The Bessamatic has a reputation as a tricky camera to repair, although if looked after it can be reliable and pleasant to use. It is certainly worth seeking out someone familiar with this model for servicing and repair, as the reputation is not totally unfounded. The mechanism is very precisely made with many small components and can be damaged if any of the controls are forced. This can easily turn a minor repair into a camera fit for spare parts use. There is also a Bessamatic CS – which has TTL CdS metering, typically fitted with a Color-Lanthar 50 mm/f2.8 lens. This was made only for a short time and is relatively uncommon. The Bessamatic m was an entry level model which has no meter at all, and is uncommon today.

He was the successor to Loncothegua. Lientur with his vice toqui Levipillan was famed for his rapid malóns or raids. Because of his ability to slip back and forth over the Spanish border between its fortresses and patrols and raid deep into Spanish territory north of the Bio-Bio River without losses he was called the Wizard by the Spanish. In 1625 his successor Butapichón was elected when he resigned his office when he felt himself to be too old and tired to continue as before.Vicente Carvallo y Goyeneche,Descripcion histórico..., TOMO I, CAPITULO CVII.

A \\"truce\\" (Ancient Greek: ékécheiria, meaning \\"laying down of arms\\") was announced before and during the Olympic Games to ensure the host city state (Elis) was not attacked and athletes and spectators could travel safely to the Games and peacefully return to their respective countries. In 1992, the International Olympic Committee renewed this tradition by calling upon all nations to observe the Truce during the modern Games. The Truce was revived by United Nations Resolution 48/11 of 25 October 1993, as well by the United Nations Millennium Declaration relating to the world peace and security.United Nations Millennium Declaration, Article 10 In 1996, the Athens Bid Committee committed to reviving the Olympic Truce and promoting it to the world through the Olympic flame relay. Three years later, the International Olympic Committee announced the establishment of the International Olympic Truce Foundation and the International Olympic Truce Centre in cooperation with Greece. The vision was to protect the interests of athletes and sport, and to promote peaceful principles in modern day. Each host city was encouraged to embrace the meaning and spirit of the Olympic Truce in the planning and staging of the Games.  Goals  Through this global and symbolic concept, the goal of the Olympic Truce movement is to: * Mobilize youth for the promotion of the Olympic ideals * Use sport to establish contacts between communities in conflict * Offer humanitarian support in countries at war * Create a window of opportunities for dialogue and reconciliation  Initiatives  * 1994 Lillehammer Winter Games: the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was allowed to participate in the Games of the XXV Olympiad in Barcelona and the XVII Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer despite ongoing wars. A delegation from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) visited Sarajevo in 1994 to extend its solidarity to the city that had organized the XIV Olympic Winter Games in 1984. * 1998 Nagano Winter Games: During a time when tension in the Persian Gulf region was high, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan intervened to seek a diplomatic resolution to the crisis in Iraq. In a release from the International Olympic Committee, the Secretary General was quoted, I call upon all nations to observe the Olympic truce. * 2000 Sydney Summer Games: During the Opening Ceremony, South and North Korean delegations walked in the stadium together, under the same flag. It was the first Olympic Games event where the two divided countries walked side by side. * 2004 Athens Summer Games: The Olympic Truce was promoted through Olympic Flame Relay events. The UN supported the IOC in asking the nations of the world to stop all wars for 16 days during the Games. * 2006 Turin Winter Games: During the games, athletes and officials showed support for the Olympic Truce by signing one of the three walls situated in the three Olympic Villages (Turin, Sestriere and Bardonecchia). * 2010 Vancouver Winter Games: Truce projects were rooted in an open invitation for people to 'Make Your Peace' which asked individuals to create everyday peace at home, schools, work, and in the community. Projects included: delivering Olympic Spirit Boxes filled with hockey, soccer, lacrosse, baseball, and basketball equipment to 20 Aboriginal communities in Northern Canada; an Olympic Truce Youth Dialogue with Canada's Governor General; and an art installation titled \\"Room to Make your Peace\\".  2012 London Summer Games  On 22 April 2011 a Member of the House of Lords – Michael Bates, Baron Bates – began walking over 3000 miles from Olympia to London to highlight the opportunity to bring the Olympic Truce into reality during the 2012 London Summer Games. Walk for Truce, Lord Bates was successful in securing pledges from a number of governments to both sign and implement the Truce, supported on his journey by the British Foreign Office. Lord Bates arrived back in London on February 15, 2012 and continues to lobby for the cause of the Olympic Truce. The UK promoted the ideals of the Olympic Truce both domestically, and for the first time internationally. The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) organised truce activities in the UK including: \\"Get Set for the Olympic Truce\\" which encourages young people across the UK to learn about the history of the Olympic Truce, to debate and discuss what the Olympic Truce means to their lives and to undertake an activity to promote peace within their school or community. Materials were promoted to over 20,000 schools registered with Get Set. Truce Inspire is a ‘truce’ strand of the Inspire programme through which LOCOG specifically looked for projects inspired by the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games which use sport or culture to promote conflict resolution, reconciliation and peace. LOCOG approved a number of projects including: a project led by the University of Ulster which uses sport to support conflict resolution across the education sector; a project providing 200 schools with the opportunity to debate the theme of the Olympic Truce at a Model UN conference; and a project which uses sport to bring together young people from London communities affected by gang rivalry. Cultural Olympiad and the London 2012 Festival organised by LOCOG and the NGO Peace One Day is delivering a truce strand of the Film Nation Shorts project through which 14- to 25-year-olds are invited to create films focused on the truce theme. LOCOG has also partnered with Peace One Day to deliver a series of concerts as part of the London 2012 Festival. International activities were led by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) which together with partners promoted the ideals of the Olympic Truce internationally under the themes of: * \\"Local solutions to local problems: Preventing conflict and building peace requires the involvement of the local communities who are most affected. We are looking for opportunities to work with host governments, communities, faith groups, civil society and the media to build relationships across boundaries. * Legitimate Politics: Legitimate politics are essential for peace. The most peaceful political systems are accountable, give everybody a voice and are trusted to manage difference and accommodate change. We are seeking to work with Parliamentarians and bodies such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy and Commonwealth to promote the Truce and encourage public commitments to conflict prevention and peace-building. * Building a 2012 Truce legacy: Through an active public diplomacy programme we have an opportunity to increase international public interest and involvement in conflict prevention and peace-building and to raise the level of ambition for future Olympic Truces\\". Speaking about the FCO's work on the Olympic Truce, Foreign Office Minister Henry Bellingham said On 28 May 2012 during the visit of Foreign Secretary William Hague to Moscow, the UK and Russian foreign ministries (in recognistion of their countries shared roles as Olympic Hosts in 2012 and 2014) agreed to work together to promote and support the ideals of the Olympic Truce. On 12 September 2012 FCO Ministers updated Parliament \\"It was a real honour for the UK to have the responsibility to promote the Olympic truce message. We worked closely on delivering an international response to the Olympic truce, working with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic games, the Department for International Development, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Culture Media and Sport\\". \\"We wanted to show that the UN resolution could be translated into international action. Our diplomatic missions across our network and the FCO in London arranged over 70 events and activities which showed how important the contribution of youth, women and those with disabilities is in promoting peace through sport, culture, education and wider public engagement. While activities took place in every continent, we specifically wanted to bring the Olympic truce to life in conflict affected and fragile countries\\". \\"The UK is the first games host to deliver this level of international ambition for the Olympic truce. The UN Secretary-General, in the presence of the International Olympic Committee, recognised the UK’s Olympic truce work on the eve of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 games. Now others are seeking to build on our experience. We are currently sharing our experience with the UN Secretary- General’s Special Adviser’s Office on sport and development for peace, as well as with Russia, which will next take stewardship of the Olympic truce in 2013, ahead of the Sochi winter games in 2014. This level of international interest, paired with our continued engagement, will help cement our legacy of encouraging future games hosts to promote the ideals of the Olympic truce in their own ways\\".  Logo  The official Olympic Truce logo is a graphic with three elements: a dove, flames, and the Olympic rings. The meaning behind the logo is as follows: :The Olympic Truce is symbolized by the dove of peace with the traditional Olympic flame in the background. In a world that is plagued by wars and animosity, the peace-dove symbol represents one of the IOC's ideals to build a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal. The Olympic flame has brought warm friendship to all the people of the world through sharing and global togetherness. In the symbol, the flame is made up of colourful effervescent elements, reminiscent of festivities experienced in the celebration of the human spirit. These elements represent people of all races coming together for the observance of the Truce. United Nations support The United Nations is in support of the Olympic Truce and before each Summer and Winter Olympic Games, adopts a resolution called \\"Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal\\". UN Member States are asked to observe the Olympic Truce, and work towards the settlement of international disagreements by peaceful and diplomatic means. The United Kingdom was the first ever nation to get all 193 UN Member states to sign the Olympic Truce resolution for the 2012 Olympic Games.Resolution A/RES/66/5. Olympic Truce Resolution. United Nations. 11 October 2011. UN Support is mainly shown through the resolution. It is also shown by the Solemn Appeals for Truce made by the UN Secretary General and the President of the General Assembly shortly before the Olympic and Winter Olympic Games. The lead office within the UN system is The United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace or UNOSDP. The current UN Special Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace is Wilfried Lemke from Bremen, Germany. UNOSDP is situated at the UN Office at Geneva plus a liaison office at UN HQ in New York. On 17 October 2011, the international community pledged to observe the Olympic Truce, individually and collectively. For London 2012, the resolution was officially titled “Sport for Peace and Development: Building a Peaceful and Better World through Sport and the Olympic Ideal” and was introduced by LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe. “The Truce helps to show the world that peace is a possibility,\\" he said Monday in New York City. \\"It shows the power that sport has to inspire unity, mutual understanding, and respect among different types of people.” Coe exhorted all member states of the UN to respect the ideals of the Truce. “Countries should feel an obligation to respect the Truce because it holds true to the idea that we can coexist without the need for discrimination and fighting\\", he urged. “It gives us something to strive towards outside of the Olympics and the arena of sport”.On the Scene—UN Adopts Olympic Truce. Around the Rings. Published October 17, 2011. Retrieved May 20, 2020.

Her documentaries investigate non-stereotypical images of Jews in history and focus on the untold stories of Jewish people. She is most well known for The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg. Life and career A child of Holocaust survivor Helen Ciesla, a Polish citizen, and Harold Kempner, a US Army officer, Kempner was born in Berlin, Germany, after World War II. Her family history inspired her to create her first documentary, Partisans of Vilna (1986). She grew up in Detroit and has a brother, Jonathan. Kempner lives in Washington, DC and is an activist for voting rights for the District of Columbia. She was a member of the Class of 1976 at the progressive Antioch School of Law. In 1981, Kempner founded The Ciesla Foundation to produce films that investigate non-stereotypical images of Jews in history and celebrate the untold stories of Jewish heroes. In 1986, Kempner conceived and produced Partisans of Vilna, a documentary on Jewish resistance against the Nazis, Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye. She co-founded the Washington Jewish Film Festival in 1989 together with Miriam Mörsel Nathan, and served as the festival's Founding Director. Additionally, she was the executive producer of the 1989 Grammy Award-nominated record Partisans of Vilna: The Songs of World War II Jewish Resistance. She is the scriptwriter, director and producer of The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg, a film about first Jewish baseball star in the Major Leagues. In 2009 she produced Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg, a 90-minute documentary about Gertrude Berg, a popular American radio and television personalities who received the first Best Actress Emmy in history and paved the way for women in media and entertainment. Berg was the creator, principal writer, and star of the popular 1930s radio show and then the 1950s weekly televised situation comedy, The Goldbergs. Kempner made Rosenwald (2015), a feature-length historical documentary about businessman and philanthropist Julius Rosenwald, who partnered with Booker T. Washington and African American communities to build over 5,000 schools in the Jim Crow South. The Rosenwald Fund also provided grants to support a who's who of African American artists and intellectuals. She is also the co-writer and co-producer of Casuse, a film about Larry Casuse, a young Native American activist who kidnapped the Mayor of Gallup, New Mexico to draw attention to the plight of the Navajo people and to expose the hypocrisy of the establishment. Kempner directed, wrote and produced The Spy Behind Home Plate, the first full length documentary about Moe Berg, a Jewish baseball player, who caught and fielded in the Major Leagues from the 1920s through 1939 during baseball's Golden Age and his activities with the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS). When asked about lessons she hoped viewers would take away from the film in a 2019 interview with Sporting News, Kempner said: > I think we need to know our history of how at a time when the world was in > peril, and how a sports hero, someone in baseball, wound up being a real > American hero. You know for me also, having done a Hank Greenberg film but > also knowing about Ted Williams and Joe Dimaggio going off to war, their > stats are not what they would have been if they hadn't sacrificed for their > country. Moe would have probably ended up being a manager afterward. They > not only sacrificed their lives, but also their sports standing. She writes film criticism and feature articles for numerous publications, including The Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, Crystal City Magazine, The Forward, Baltimore Jewish Times, Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Legal Times, New York Times, The Wrap, Washington Jewish Week and The Washington Post. Kempner said in a 2009 interview with FF2 Media's Jan Huttner: \\"In The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg, we use this line: 'When America needed a hero, a Jewish slugger stepped to the plate.'

It took about ten years to develop and started a new era in the Minolta SR system. It was the first Minolta SLR with interchangeable lenses to have an electronically controlled shutter, a horizontically traveling shutter with titanium foil curtains and capable of a shortest speed of 1/2000s (longest selectable was 16 s). It had interchangeable finders: * AE-Finder: The standard finder with a refined CLC metering system (introduced by the SR-T 101) and aperture priority auto exposure mode. * M-Finder: A simpler and cheaper version of the AE-finder, the match-needle finder. It did not show metered shutter times but had only a needle to align. It lacked the automatic mode. * P-finder: The plain finder, an unmetered pentaprism finder, which gave the X-1 a much more compact silhouette than the bulky finders above. * High-Magnification-Finder: Unmetered finder with 6.2 magnification ratio and diopter adjustment. * Waist- Level-Finder: Unmetered with magnifier. * AE-S-Finder: Introduced with the X-1 Motor and equipped with a silicon cell instead of the slower CdS-cell of the AE-Finder. This was necessary for the auto exposure mode with motorized action. And the photographer had the choice among nine (later eleven) interchangeable focussing screens. It further had a socket for a synchronised flash shoe, mirror lock up feature, stop down lever, multi-exposure capability. The X-1 was the first of the X-series and so a completely new designed lens line was introduced and labelled with 'MC Rokkor-X' in the North American market (the rest of the world kept the plain 'MC Rokkor' designation). The most striking attribute was the new waffled rubber coating of the focus grip. The X-1 and its export descendants were available in black finish only.

Early history The gatehouse range, seen from the bailey The castle started as an 11th-century motte-and-bailey earthwork named Blythe Castle, built by Roger de Busli, a major landholder in the Domesday Book holding 174 estates in Nottinghamshire, on land granted to him by William the Norman. The castle was deliberately built on the Nottingham/Yorkshire border, as Roger held authority in both. After a siege in 1102 Robert Bloet added a curtain wall to the rampart around the bailey; the first part of the castle to be built of stone. David Hey, Medieval South Yorkshire From 1151 to 1153, the castle was held by Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester before his death after being poisoned. In 1180 construction began on an 11-sided or circular keep on top of the motte by Henry II of England; it was completed in 1192 along with a stone bridge and a chapel constructed by Eleanor of Aquitaine. Possession by John of England In 1189, the land around Tickhill was granted to John of England by his brother Richard I of England, although the castle was withheld by Richard, along with Launceston, Rougemont Castle, Exeter, Gloucester and Nottingham, as Richard did not trust John's loyalty while he participated in the Third Crusade. His fears proved well founded after John seized the kingdom in 1191 from William Longchamp, Richard's chosen regent. Along with Windsor Castle, Tickhill was John's main stronghold to protect against a suspected invasion by Philip II of France. Tickhill and Nottingham became John's last strongholds under the command of Robert de la Mare, and was besieged by Hugh de Puiset in 1194, with defenders holding out until they heard of the return of Richard to England. After gaining permission from Hugh they sent two knights to find out directly if Richard was indeed returned, and the knights immediately offered to restore the castle to Richard. Richard refused, saying he would only accept an unconditional surrender, which the knights negotiated upon their return, surrendering the castle to Hugh de Puiset in exchange for the defenders' lives.W. Stubbs, ed. Chronica magistri Rogeri de Houedene In 1321, the castle was unsuccessfully laid siege by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster during a rebellion against Edward II. In 1372, it was granted to John of Gaunt by Edward III in exchange for the Earldom of Richmond. It remains a property of the Duchy of Lancaster to this day. English Civil War By 1540, the castle was in poor repair; the lease was obtained in 1612 by Sir Ralph Hansby, who had the castle repaired and fortified. During the English Civil War the castle remained loyal to the crown, with Major Monckton set in charge of the castle after Sir Ralph's death in 1643. In 1644, John Lilburne and 200 dragoons from the Earl of Manchester's army marched to Tickhill, and accepted the castle's surrender on 26 July. The castle was razed in 1648 to prevent its use as a stronghold in the future. Present day The house After the Civil War, the Hansby family built a large house, which retains the fortified Norman gatehouse and may incorporate parts of the old hall. The site of the bailey is now part of the gardens.Chibnall, M., 1976, ‘Robert of Bellême and the castle of Tickhill' in Droit Privé et Institutions Régionales: Etudes Historiques Offertes à Jean Yver Tickhill Castle. The castle is now a private residence and the monument is maintained by the Duchy of Lancaster, and opened to the public one day a year.

This demand for high quality 35mm picture making tools was based on portability and the increasing availability of 35mm motion picture film, packaged into spools and marketed to amateur as well as professional photographers. The Contax became the 'first choice' among the professional community while the Leica was considered more the choice for well heeled amateurs and practitioners of a more artistic leaning. For example: Robert Capa in the first camp and Alexander Rodchenko in the second. Zeiss continued to follow their philosophy of designing and building cameras and scientific equipment to the highest standards, having total reliability and the finest optical performance. The Zeiss lenses of the day were far superior to all their competitors and still enjoy a loyal following among lens aficionados. The 5 cm F1.5 Sonnar is still considered to be one of the finest lenses ever produced for the 35mm film format.

Background The outbreak of World War I led to the transfer of the British Imperial garrison from South Africa to France. Expecting the war to finish quickly, a large number of South Africans also departed for Europe, aiming to take part in the combat. The Union Defence Force took the responsibility of independently protecting South Africa from a possible German offensive. In the meantime, prime minister Louis Botha found himself in the middle of a confrontation between British loyalists supporting full involvement in the war and Afrikaner nationalists advocating neutrality. German colonial troops in South West Africa numbered 140 officers, 2,000 regulars and 2,500 reservists organised into eight mounted companies, a single camel corp, four field batteries and an air wing. 1,500 policemen and 200 Boer rebels could also be potentially mobilized. The majority of the army consisted of non Askaris, being resented by the aboriginal population due to their conduct during the Herero Wars. Despite their unpopularity the German Schutztruppe was well organised and disciplined. The UDF had the ability to mobilize as many as 100,000 troops, yet it had a heterogeneous structure and lacked experienced staff officers. A large portion of the South African-German borderline consisted of a ragged open desert characterised by the absence of water. The difficult terrain enabled the German army to create a defensive frontier along the line of Windhuk and Keetmanshoop, and troops were also stationed adjacent to the two regional railroads. Having a limited number of troops in his possession, the German commander, Joachim von Heydebreck, ordered his troops to assume defensive positions and observe predefined routes. The area of Sandfontein held a high strategic importance due to the presence of the only high quality water wells in a 75-kilometer radius, thus being a crucial supply point for any large scale operation. The South African military was well aware of the complicated geographic conditions, possessing a variety of prewar journals and reports concerning German South West Africa's topology. On 7 August 1914, Britain requested Botha to capture the German communication stations of Windhoek, Swakopmund and Lüderitzbucht. On 10 August, following intense negotiations the Botha government reluctantly agreed to the creation of a volunteer expeditionary force, only after the approval of the parliament. Mobilization and troop maneuvers ensued even prior to the parliament's decision, as the government enforced censorship on the press to suppress the spread of rumors. On 21 August 1914, the expeditionary force took its final form. A column consisting of 1,200 soldiers and six artillery pieces known as Force C was to strike Lüderitzbucht. A column consisting of 1,800 soldiers and eight guns known as Force A would land at Port Nolloth, in support of Force C. Finally the 1,000 man Force B would invade from the eastern direction, attacking Upington. The plans regarding the invasion were revealed during a 9 September parliament session, gaining approval. On 14 September 1914 South Africa officially entered the war, however the situation was soon complicated by the outbreak of the Maritz Rebellion the following day. The revolt led to the resignation of several high ranking commanders involved in the expeditionary force, who now rose in an open rebellion against their former colleagues and had to be hastily replaced. Battle On 12 September 1914, Force A under Brigadier-General Tim Lukin arrived to the border post axis of Raman's Drift, Houms Drift and Gudous. A week later, the 4th and 5th South Africa Mounted Riflemen regiments penetrated the border capturing Sandfontein. Force A proceeded to disperse, occupying Steinkopf and Raman's Drift, as German troops began concentrating on the eastern border. Sandfontein remained isolated and vulnerable to attack as the area was surrounded by hillocks and narrow sand ridges that could be used during an encirclement maneuver. The German command made full use of its superior intelligence, having previously detained a South African scout and holding the allegiance of the rebellious Force B commander Manie Maritz. Sandfontein's garrison of 120 men was hurriedly reinforced by two squadrons of mounted riflemen, two machine guns, an ambulance and two 13 pound artillery pieces on the early morning of 26 September. A force of 1,700 men, ten artillery batteries and four machine guns gathered at Warmbad, encompassing Sandfontein on the dawn of 26 September. The German column immediately launched a simultaneous attack from the direction of Houms Drift and Warmbad, surprising the defenders. The defenders began engaging the German cavalry that emerged from the north east, when another body of troops suddenly appeared from the south western direction. At approximately 8 o'clock fighting intensified, with the beginning of an artillery duel. Enjoying numerical superiority the German troops struck the unprotected flank and rear of the British, who had lost the capacity of breaking through the encirclement. A British machine gun section foiled an infantry rush coming from northeast, which intended to capture the battlefield's tallest hillock. At the same time a German machine gunner approached from the south, killing a large pack of horses and scattering the remains, later destroying an enemy machine gun position. On 8.30 a second German battery made its appearance, suppressing the British artillery and slaughtering a second pack of horses stationed nearby. At 10.00, German infantry attempted a second charge from the eastern direction, retreating after suffering heavy casualties. At 11.00 transferred their artillery and machine guns to the southwest, concealing among the stony outcrops, an hour later the distance separating the two combatants numbered approximately 550 meters. Around the same time British commander colonel R.C. Grant was wounded by machine gun fire and was substituted by captain E.J. Welby, before again assuming command. Between 13.00 – 14.00, the main body of German troops ceased hostilities in order to have a meal while continuing to bombard the exhausted British troops, the majority of whom spent the previous night marching. By 17.00 German troops managed to halve the distance separating them from the British positions, now employing high explosive shells. At around 18.00, the British troops raised the white flag. German casualties amounted to 14 dead and 46 wounded, while the South Africans lost 16 men dead and 51 wounded.

It is the final in a trilogy of games that also includes Earnest Evans and El Viento. The game was released only in Japan in 1993. Gameplay bosses Unlike the first and second entries, which are 2D platform video games, Annet Futatabi is a side- scrolling beat-em-up that deeply resembles Sega's Golden Axe and Bare Knuckle franchises. However, like the previous installments, the story is told through cutscenes between each brief multi-scrolling level, which includes a boss character, who appears out of thin air, usually wielding a weapon. The protagonist Annet's magic has five levels, is regulated by a power meter, and regenerates automatically. As her power meter increases, the higher her magical attacks become. The levels range from wind, earth, water, fire and death. Wind is the lower level, while death is the highest level. However, magic cannot be used against the bosses. In addition to magic, Annet wields a sword, rather than bladed boomerangs. There are not any other weapons or power-ups included in the game, other than health restoration items. Plot Set in the same fictional universe as Earnest Evans and El Viento, the story takes place two years after El Viento, and concludes the story of Annet and Earnest. Zigfried's true motives are finally revealed as well. Being rescued from a certain sacrifice by father figure Earnest Evans, Annet travels across Europe and encounters a local sect that wants her special pendant. After an attempted ambush in the sect's castle, she barely escapes, and begins another quest to protect the world from destruction. Reception The game was received poorly, with the difficulty and graphics highlighted as the main criticisms. However, the cutscenes' graphics were praised. Writing for Hardcore Gaming 101, Kurt Kalata criticized the game design and difficulty, saying, \\"Most of the end level monstrosities have pretty braindead attack patterns, but they’re so strong that it’s hard to attack them efficiently [...] The extreme level of challenge is clearly to mask the fact that there just isn’t much game here.\\" Kalata also criticized the graphics, saying, \\"The in-game graphics are pretty average. Although Annet looks much cooler here than she did in El Viento, the rest of the visuals are run of the mill and forgettable.\\" He praised the cutscenes, saying \\"Anyone with a fetish for the 16-bit, low color, ’90s style anime artwork that proliferated on the Mega CD and PC Engine will love this.\\" Ken Horowitz of Sega-16 compared the game unfavorably to Streets of Rage, saying, \\"Playing more like Streets of Rage than El Viento, Anet Futatabi comes off as the bastard child of two genres – a part of both, yet truly belonging to neither.\\" He also praised the cutscenes, saying \\"There are also plenty of beautiful cut scenes to gander at between each [stage]\\", but criticized the non-cutscene graphics, calling them \\"bland\\".

The Connacht final was not held in time to produce a team that could compete against the other three provinces in the semi-finals. Mayo was therefore nominated to represent the province. Mayo beat Wexford in the semi final. Kerry beat Cavan in the other semi-final. However, both Kerry and Cavan were disqualified for fielding illegal players. This meant that Mayo were declared champions without the need for a final. However, in the meantime, Galway had defeated Mayo in the Connacht final and this put the GAA in a bind.

It is the district umbrella administration board under which the Ludington Public Library (city) and the Scottville Public Library (county) function.Ludington Daily News, February 9, 1993Ludington Daily News, February 15, 1994 It consists of a seven-member board of trustees. The Ludington Public Library is in the city of Ludington in Mason County. The Scottville Public Library is in Scottville which is about 10 miles to the east of Ludington on the edge of the county. Mason County has a population of about 28,000 that the public library administration system serves. History When the library district administration board was created in 1994 with the merger of the Ludington City Library and the County Library in Scottville - the promise was made to maintain as much as possible 2 fully functioning libraries - that neither would be considered a 'branch' of the other. The Mason County District Library is the formal name of the administration for both libraries.Ludington Daily News, July 3, 1992 Under the Mason County District Library system umbrella these libraries are referred to as the Ludington 'branch' or the Scottville 'branch.' The Mason County District Library administration system itself is not any independent building. These libraries are each fully independent libraries maintaining the same open hours. The Mason County District Library is the formal name of the administration for both libraries but each library continues to be known as either the Ludington Public Library or the Scottville Public Library. The reason the board was established was to pool the resources of the city library (Ludington) with the county library (Scottville) and to eliminate duplication of services.Ludington Daily News, February 11, 1993 The process was to develop a board of combining the resources of the city and county under one district library administration called the \\"Mason County District Library\\". It is designed to offer \\"enhanced service\\" over the separate city and county library operations. There would be a .5 mill tax on property owners of Mason County and then no need for funding from the city or county. It would save the residents of the city and county over $100,000 per year starting in 1996. Divisions The Ludington Public Library is a branch or division of the Mason County District Library administrative board. The collection of the Ludington Public Library contains 65,000 volumes. This library circulates over 170,000 items per year. The Scottville Public Library is a branch or division of the Mason County District Library administrative board. The collection of the Scottville Public Library contains 35,000 volumes. This library circulates over 75,000 items per year. The Mason County District Library has over 95,000 volumes (Ludington library + Scottville library) and circulates nearly a quarter million items per year (Ludington library + Scottville library) to over 28,000 Mason County residents of which 10,000 are registered members. Current events In July 2008, District Library Director Robert Dickson terminated the employment of Sally Stern- Hamilton for writing a pseudonymous book that \\"portrays these people (library patrons) in a very unflattering manner\\" and whose cover includes a small picture of the Ludington Library.

The record was released in September 1981 by Concord Jazz, a subsidiary of Concord Records. It was produced by Russell Gloyd and engineered by Ron Davis and Phil Edwards. On this recording, pianist Dave Brubeck is accompanied by his son Chris Brubeck on the bass and bass trombone, with Jerry Bergonzi on tenor sax and Randy Jones on the drums. Paper Moon is Brubeck's third of three Concord recordings featuring this permutation of the Dave Brubeck Quartet; jazz commentator Scott Yanow referred to the album as the \\"most rewarding of the trio\\".  Analysis  Stylistically, Paper Moon is typical Dave Brubeck cool jazz, varying only slightly from past Brubeck recordings. The tracks on this album are less hurried than those on Time Out, Brubeck's best known recording. Paper Moon is a highly accessible recording; it flows seamlessly with the bass and drums providing a steady accompaniment.  \\"It's Only a Paper Moon\\"  The title track, \\"It’s Only a Paper Moon\\", begins with Dave Brubeck's piano, backed by the drummer's fast but light rhythm and the bassist's syncopated plucking. About forty seconds into the track the piano switches to stride style, and at 0:52 the saxophone enters on the melody as Dave Brubeck comps. At 2:38 Dave Brubeck begins his piano solo using block chords. His solo continues until 3:31 when bass player Chris Brubeck, now on bass trombone, takes over. His improvisation dips into the lowest registers, giving the piece a fuller and rougher tone. His solo ends the piece with a repeat of the chorus.

He was killed in Tartus, Syria on August 1, 2008 by Shayetet 13, an Israeli Navy special forces unit. Early life Suleiman was born in 1959 to a rich aristocratic Alawite family. Career Suleiman had been a top aide to Bashar al Assad even before he assumed the presidential office, from the time he appeared as heir to succeed his father, Hafez al-Assad, as president. Former Director General of Mossad Meir Dagan used to refer to him as the 'Commander of the Shadow Army'. Israel's Military Intelligence AMAN believed he had 'extraordinary organizational and logistical abilities'. He was also in charge of highly classified military and intelligence work, such as handling relations with the IAEA and the construction of the nuclear Al Kibar facility. He handled secretive intelligence affairs for the president and was reportedly also in charge of arms transfers from Syria to Hezbollah and Hamas in neighbouring Lebanon and Gaza. He had also built very close ties with Hezbollah's chief of staff Imad Mughniyeh and Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. Assassination and perpetrators It was reported by Iranian media that Suleiman was shot by a silenced weapon in the head and neck on a beach at al-Rimal al-Zahabiyeh resort near Tartus on 1 August 2008. According to the As-Safir newspaper, arrested Mossad spy Ali Jarrah \\"testified to have scouted 'certain points' in the coastal town of Tartus in northern Syria,\\" where Suleiman was assassinated. The Sunday Times reported that Suleiman was assassinated by Israeli Special Forces. A cable released by WikiLeaks revealed that France told the United States that Suleiman was probably killed as a result of political rivalry within the Syrian government. Maher al-Assad, brother of the Syrian president, was likely to have ordered the killing. Furthermore, France said that Suleiman was not killed by a sniper, but in fact gunned down in his car. In a 2009 article regarding the destruction of Al Kibar, Der Spiegel gives a detailed description of Suleiman's assassination as having taken place by sniper shots from a passing yacht and implies that it was linked to his direct involvement in the construction the Al Kibar Nuclear facility and strong ties to Hezbollah and Iran. In 2015, a National Security Agency document leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that Shayetet 13 were indeed directly behind Suleiman's killing. Funeral Suleiman was buried on 3 August 2008. The funeral was attended by Maher al-Assad. The New Yorker quotes an unnamed former Israeli official: \\"There was no funeral, no event. Nothing. They never admitted that he was killed. He just disappeared.” https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/10/qassem-suleimani-and-how- nations-decide-to-kill Aftermath According to a U.S. State Department cable published by WikiLeaks, Syrian authorities found $80 million in cash in the basement of Suleiman's home.

He is said to have lived at the court of Constantinople, and to have obtained the dignity of Archiater. He belonged to the medical sect of the Empirici, but not without a certain mixture of the doctrines of the Methodici, and even of the Dogmatici.Theodorus Priscianus, Rerum Medicarum Libri Quatuor, praef. p. 81, ed. Argent.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. Works The Rerum Medicarum Libri Quatuor, or \\"Medical Matters in Four Books\\", is sometimes attributed to a person named Octavius Horatianus. The first book treats of external diseases, the second of internal, the third of female diseases, and the fourth of physiology, etc. The author, in his preface, speaks against the learned and worthy disputes physicians held at the bedside of the patient, and against their reliance on foreign remedies in preference indigenous ones. It was first published in 1532, in a folio edition at Strasburg, and a quarto edition at Basel. Of these the latter is more correct than the other, but not so complete, as the whole of the fourth book is wanting, and also several chapters of the first and second books. It also appeared in Kraut's Experimentarius Medicinae, Argent, folio, 1544, and in the Aldine Collection of Medici Antiqui Latini, 1547, folio, Venet. J. M.

Design and construction Walter Wurdeman & Welton Becket were the building's architects. P.J. Walker Co. was the general contractor, and Carl Larsen was the construction superintendent. Groundbreaking on the 13-story building was on July 11, 1947, and the steel structure was virtually complete by December 1947. On February 27, 1948, a 31-year-old rigger, Laurence Leslie, slipped and fell to his death from scaffolding on the fourth floor. In March 1948, while still under construction, the building was sold to the New York Life Insurance Co. with a lease back to General Petroleum Corp. The purchase price was later disclosed to have been $11,750,000. The first offices were occupied in February 1949, and the building was dedicated on April 1, 1949 in a ceremony attended by Governor Earl Warren, Mayor Fletcher Bowron, and other dignitaries. At the time of its dedication, it had 504,000 square feet and was the largest office building in Southern California. Upon completion, the \\"Mobiloil\\" and \\"Mobilgas\\" names and flying red horse logo were displayed from the top of the building. The development also included a six-story rectangular parking garage, also designed by Wurdeman & Becket, built two blocks south on the corner of 8th and Flower, with space for 446 cars and a spiral interior path allowing cars to drive from the first level to the higher levels. At the time, the spiral design allowing for self parking was described the Los Angeles Times as \\"the only one of its kind in the nation.\\" Later use and designation The building was vacated in 1994 and converted into 322 apartments in 2003 by developers Kennedy Wilson and the KOR Realty Group. The apartment building was, and remains, operated under the name Pegasus in tribute to the flying red horse that was displayed for decades atop the structure. On June 22, 2004, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places based on architectural criteria.

It encompasses the village center of the town, which has acted as a civic and commercial center since the late 18th century. Its architectural heritage dates back to that time, but is now dominated by buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history The town of Ashfield was settled in 1736 and incorporated in 1765. Its early town center was located at the northeast fringe of the present town center, but migrated toward \\"The Plain\\" where it is now later in the 18th century. This area, set on a relatively large level area (in otherwise hilly terrain) along the main road leading east toward the Connecticut River valley, was a natural place for taverns and other businesses to congregate. The town was economically dominated by agriculture, but small water-powered industries developed along the South River, which runs to the north of Main Street and was impounded by a dam in the early 19th century (forming Ashfield Great Pond) to facilitate those uses. The historic district is essentially linear in character, extending along Main Street (Massachusetts Route 116) between Ashfield Great Pond in the west and Bishop Corner Road in the east, and then northward along Bishop Corner Road. It extends for short distances along some side roads, and along those two roads beyond their intersection to the east and south. It is in size, and is composed mainly of one and two-story wood frame residences. The central core of the village includes a number of commercial buildings, all also of wood-frame construction, as well as most of the town's civic buildings. Among the buildings included in the district is Ashfield's Town Hall, which was built in the 1810s to house the First Congregational Church. While still in use by the congregation the building was moved down a steep hill to its present location. In 1870 the building was sold to the town, and adapted for use as town hall.

The church is notable for the history of construction, movement, and reconstruction, since it was first erected in 1739, just two years after Bernardston was settled. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Its congregation is affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist Association which was established in 1820. Architecture and building history Located in the town's village center, at the southeast corner of Church and Depot Streets, it features a two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its architectural style is Greek Revival, featuring corner pilasters rising to an entablature and fully pedimented gables. An entry pavilion with similar features projects slightly from the main block. A square tower rises above the roof ridge, with a plain first stage and two octagonal stages of decreasing size above it, capped by a bellcast cupola and weathervane. The interior -- originally a single story with gallery -- is now two stories, with the sanctuary on the upper level and vestry and office spaces on the ground floor. The sanctuary's earliest documented organization included box pews and a high pulpit; these were removed during 19th-century alterations. The church began as an early colonial meeting house, located on Huckle Hill, near the town's early residential concentration. It was moved in 1772 on capstans and rollers using human power. In 1791 it was moved again, this time by disassembly and reconstruction, to a location on Bald Mountain Road. It was moved a third time in 1825, again by disassembly, to its present location. It was significantly altered in 1846, which it acquired its Greek Revival features and its belfry. The congregation began as a traditional Congregationalist community, which became Unitarian in the early 19th century; its more traditional Trinitarians split off to form the present Congregational group in 1824.

He is also known as Time Shadow. Biography Holland grew up in the British Guyana, in a family which forbade any music other than hymns and classical music, due to the deaths of his maternal grandfather and uncle on separate occasions, whilst playing popular music at a nightclub. His mother, a piano teacher, would instruct him on various classical pieces, which he would then practice on the piano until he fell asleep. Eventually, when he was thirteen years old, he began to play the keyboard in secret, until his parents found out when he was fourteen. Years later, his parents gave up the ban on popular music, and Holland moved to London, attending the Royal School of Music and then eventually pursued a scholarship in New York City, where he attended the Aaron Copland School of Music. During the mid-seventies, Holland began receiving calls from jazz legends including Steve Jordan and the Brecker Brothers, to do sessions with them. However, he did not have confidence in his own abilities, and so declined each time. His musical career began when he successfully auditioned as musical director at the Brooklyn Pilgrim Church. He then called in his colleagues from college to work with him, and eventually started his own gospel/fusion band. As Holland's career blossomed, he received offers from numerous gospel artists, but he declined, in order to stay with the church, until he realized he would need more than the $350 per month salary he received. He then co-produced a Christmas album by Mariah Carey, with Carey and Walter Afanasieff, and also set up a writing and production deal with Zomba Music and Jive Records. He later worked at London's battery studio's, together with artists including Jonathan Butler and Ruby Turner, but quit work there after a dissatisfaction with cuts made on the album he had worked on with Turner, and after Zomba Music called his writing partners to join them. and his singers teamed up with Mariah Carey, (although they would still call on him to play music for them, and ask to use it in their tracks) he resumed work at the Brooklyn Pilgrim Church. Holland was eventually asked by Tony Prendatt to help Fugees member Lauryn Hill, who was working on her own hip-hop record, but was unhappy with her players. When he played for her, she had him redo everything on the track, in favor of his work. She asked him to be her musical director, but he declined though he stayed and helped her band along. Awards and nominations He has been nominated for five Daytime Emmy awards from 2001 to 2005, all of which were for Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition for a Drama Series, for his work on All My Children. He won the award in 2002, 2003, and 2005. His first nomination was shared with Terry Walker, A.J.

The TECO Enhanced Long through truss bridge was built in 1951 by the T. J. Harvey Company, to a design by the Timber Engineering Company (TECO) and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (DOT). The bridge is long, and rests on stone- faced reinforced concrete abutments. Mill Brook passes fifteen to twenty feet below the bridge at normal water levels. It was the first covered bridge to be built in Massachusetts in the 20th century, replacing an earlier covered bridge that dated to about 1881. The bridge is sited near an old mill dam and pond, and is not far (about ) from the house of Henry W. Bissell, for whom it is named. The town appropriated $1000 for its construction in 1880, and it is assumed to have been built not long afterward. By the mid 20th century the bridge was deteriorating, and the DOT condemned it. The town vehemently opposed the construction of a modern steel-and-concrete structure as its replacement, and the matter drew a great deal of media attention. The design that resulted from the decision-making process was a near replica of the original bridge. It was built at a cost (shared by all levels of government) of $50,000 to $55,000.

Probably built in 1870, it is a regionally rare example of a multiple kingrod bridge with iron tensioning verticals (a modified Howe truss system), and one of a few 19th century covered bridges to survive in Massachusetts. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Burkeville Covered Bridge stands in the formerly industrial village of Burkeville, west of the center of Conway, carrying Main Poland Road over the South River just south of Massachusetts Route 116. It is of kingrod truss construction, with a total truss length of and a roadway width of (one lane). It is covered by a gabled metal roof and its sides are finished in vertical board siding. Its wooden trusses, in contrast to kingpost trusses, have wrought iron verticals which transmit the active load to the top chord of the truss. In some places, fittings of the trusses have either been replaced or reinforced by steel components. The first bridge on the site is thought to have been built in 1850, when Main Poland Road was rerouted to accommodate changes in the water impoundments for the industrial facilities then active in Burkeville. The present bridge was built in 1870 after that bridge was damaged in a major flood the previous year. It was closed after the 1938 New England hurricane weakened it, and it underwent major repairs. In the following years, its stone abutments were faced in concrete. Its roof partially collapsed under heavy snow in 1975, but was restored by town volunteers. It was closed for safety reasons in 1985, and reopened to vehicular traffic in November 2013 after renovations.

The district's properties represent the growth of the village center from its rural origin through a period of 19th century industrialization, including 18th and 19th century farmsteads, Greek Revival buildings of the mid 19th century, and later 19th century Victorian architectural styles. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The area that is now the town of Charlemont was surveyed by colonists in 1736, with settlement following in the early 1740s. It was abandoned during King George's War in the late 1740s, and resettled soon after that war ended. The village center was the principal nexus of this early settlement, even including a grist mill on Mill Brook. Significant population growth did not take place until the 1760s, and the town incorporated in 1765. The village was the site of an early tavern, where the 1787 Charlemont Inn now stands; it is said that Benedict Arnold stayed there in the early days of the American Revolutionary War. The town's economy was based on agriculture, taking advantage of the fertile floodplain of the Deerfield River. The village experienced a growth spurt in the third quarter of the 19th century, when the Hoosac Tunnel construction brought workers to the town, and continued through the end of the 19th century. Its economic fortunes waned in the early 20th century, with the advent of the automobile and a decline in its small industries. The historic district is basically linear in shape, extending for about along Massachusetts Route 2, the principal east-west route through the town. Its western boundary is roughly Harmony Lane, and its eastern end is at South Street. Prominent buildings in the district, in addition to the inn, include the 1803 Baptist church (built elsewhere and moved here in the 19th century), an 1831 two-story schoolhouse, Greek Revival church buildings for Congregationalist and Methodist congregations, and the town hall, a high-style Romanesque brick building constructed in 1892.

The center began as the location of a local farm, and a bridge which might have been the one that was remade in 2018. The land area available for development in this area is limited by steep hilly terrain and the floodplains of the North River. The center of the district and the village is the town green, a triangular patch of land at the junction of Main Road, Greenville Road and Jacksonville Road, and it is naturally bounded by the terrain, a steeply sided valley along a branch of the North River. Most of the housing in the district dates from the mid 19th century to the early 20th century, as do its institutional buildings. The Town Hall is a former congregational church, built in the Greek Revival style in 1834. The other former church building is the Methodist Church, built a few years later, but with Gothic Revival features; it was vacant in 2006. The Griswold Public Library building (1908, Classical Revival) is the only institutional building still used for its original purpose; all the others have either been lost or adaptively reused.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The town of Conway was settled in the 1760s and incorporated in 1767. The town's meetinghouse and early taverns were located in the area of the South River, along the main east-west road (which ran north of present Massachusetts Route 116). The area saw increased economic activity with the advent of industrialization in the 19th century, which took place in Conway primarily a short way to the west of the center in Burkeville. The main road was relocated southward in 1832, from which time the present town center began to take shape. The lack of railroad access to the area hurt the town's textile mills in the later 19th century, whose decline a belated introduction of a streetcar rail failed to stem. Many of the structures in Conway Center are houses, which are predominantly of 19th century wood frame construction, although there are a number of Colonial Revival structures from the early 20th century. Forty percent of the building stock was built during the boom years of the 1840s and 1850s, and is mainly Greek Revival in character.

Its significance was recognized, and the site was protected by a protective covenant. Adjacent land, in private ownership, was investigated in 1995 by Dr. Richard Gramly, and was acquired by the state when it was threatened by development. The site was again excavated by Dr. Gramly in 2013. This work greatly expanded the number of finds, and is of the opinion that the site is one of largest late-Clovis sites in New England. It has yielded stone artifacts such as scrapers, drills, hammerstones, and a stone bead, with the source stone material coming from a variety of locations across New England.

The plan consists of a 12-story office tower incorporating premium luxury condominiums in its top three floors, two hotels, retail spaces and an underground parking garage. The parking garage was completed in 2017. History Demolition of former buildings at the City Center construction site in August 2008 The project launched in summer 2008, when the designers razed the existing buildings on the construction site. The original estimated time of completion was in 2010 as it was intended to serve as a centerpiece for business during the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games. Before the construction of City Center began, many local residents objected to the project as it meant the destruction of Morton's Row, a row of buildings that were structurally insecure but used to be the city's second-oldest commercial district, and a local bar, The Dame. Morton's Row's buildings had flooded basements due to Town Branch creek running below it in a culvert. The buildings were in such disrepair before the developer bought them that they were not allowed to occupy the upstairs floors. In July 2008, the Fayette Alliance — a coalition of developers, neighborhood associations, and farmers — revoked its support for the building, due to an apparent reluctance on the part of the developer to work with concerned parties in addressing various issues concerning the development. In addition to the controversy surrounding The Dame, debate arose regarding the use of Tax Increment Financing for the development. Initially concern centered on the application of taxpayer money without the inclusion of ideas from those taxpayers. This opposition arose mostly from a common misunderstanding of Tax Increment Financing, which utilizes the boom property tax value from a redevelopment project to fund improvements locally. The issue went before the city council in September 2008. The council voted in favor of utilizing Tax Increment Financing for the project due to the infrastructure improvements for the surrounding area including sidewalks and underground parking structures. On June 25, 2009, the process of seeding and filling the City Center construction site began. On September 10, 2013, EOP, the architecture firm behind the fifth iteration of the City Center design announced they were pulling out of the project. Preliminary construction began in December 2013 and blasting for the parking structure and foundation began on March 17, 2014. The 700-space underground parking garage was expected to be completed by late summer 2014, but was not. Developers then attempted to sell $30 million in bonds solely devoted towards building the parking garage. Though construction on the parking garage was slow, the garage was ultimately finished in late 2017 and then first beam of the above-ground portion of the project was erected on December 19, 2017. Design evolution City Center constriction progress October 2018 The original plan in 2008 called for a 35-story, high rise which would include a hotel, condominiums, retail and office space. The entire development was estimated to cost $250 million and would have become the tallest building in Lexington upon completion. Three other proposed designs followed. The first two entailed one large building that would have covered the entire block. But after Studio Gang Architects became involved in the project in 2011, the latter two proposed designs have entailed one tower and several low rise buildings. Jeanne Gang, lead architect of Studio Gang Architects, was hired to draft ideas for the City Center project in 2011. She proposed a 30-story tower which would include a ten-floor boutique hotel, ten floors of apartments, seven floors of condominiums, and three floors of penthouses. Her design also called for an eight-story building on the intersection of South Limestone Street and West Main Street along with a row of low rises on West Main Street. In 2012, the Webb Companies released a design that resembled that of Studio Gang Architects. The proposed design included a 28-story hotel-condominium tower at the intersection of West Vine Street and South Upper Street, four smaller buildings on West Main Street, and a low-rise office building at South Limestone Street and West Main Street. A revised 2013 plan downsized the main high rise from 28 to 19 floors. It included a 286-room hotel along with 96 apartments and 10,700 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. The office building was planned to have 157,710 square feet of offices as well as restaurants and retailers. The development was estimated to cost US $393.9 million. The hotel-condominium tower was modified by architectural firm Rabun Rasche Rector Reece in 2014. A terrace on the twelfth floor of the tower was added along with a contemporary glass facade. The first eleven floors will serve as a 205-room Marriott hotel while the remaining seven floors are reserved for condominiums and penthouse suites. The plan for the apartment complex, originally to be seven floors, was revised to include twelve floors with retail on the first floor, 100 extended- stay suites on floors two through five, and apartments on floors six through twelve.

Although it was settled in the late 18th century, issues with Hawley's boundaries meant that the development of a central village did not take place until later. East Hawley was developing as a local transportation hub by the mid 1820s, with several roads (mainly East Hawley Road, Plainfield Road, Ashfield Road, and Buckland Road, the latter three leading to eponymous neighboring towns) converging in the area. The establishment of a store and post office, and the relocation of the Congregational Church into the area cemented its importance in the town's civic life. There was some industrial mill activity in the area during the 19th century, but this came to an end near the end of the century, and only a mill pond remains. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The historic district occupies a small plateau in the eastern part of the hilly town, extending along Plainfield Road between Buckland Road and Ashfield Road. The northern junction is the focal point of the village, where the town's small common (laid out in 1848) and church are located. The architecture in the district is largely vernacular in character, with modest stylistic elements from late 18th to late 19th century architectural styles. The church is probably the most architecturally sophisticated building; it is Greek Revival in character and dates to the late 1840s. One unusual feature of the district is a rare 19th-century charcoal- making kiln, which is set in the woods at the western edge of the district; it is one of the reminder's of the village's modest industrial history.

It encompasses a predominantly residential area just east of Greenfield's central business district, historically where the town's wealthier residents lived, and features a wide variety of mainly 19th-century residential architecture. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The city of Greenfield was settled as part of Deerfield in the 17th century, and was separately incorporated in 1753. It was reincorporated as a city in 2003. Due to its location near the confluence of the Deerfield and Connecticut Rivers, it developed in the 18th century as a regional center, and was named the shire town of Franklin County when it was established in 1813. The area east of its central business district was from the early 19th century a popular place for the well-to-do to live, a practice that continued through the 19th century. The historic district consists of an area of roughly two square blocks, east of Federal Street (United States Route 5) and the commercial district of Main Street. It is bounded on the north by Church Street, the east by High Street, and the south by Main Street. Its western boundary is generally Franklin Street, although it extends westward nearly to Federal Street on Church Street. It has an area of about , and most of its architecture is residential, predominantly wood frame buildings of 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 stories. There are four churches. The buildings are architecturally diverse, with the Italianate one of the most common varieties found; many buildings exhibit multiple styles, owing to alterations made over time. The district's residents included the owners and management of major local businesses, as well as prominent lawyers and politicians.

The two properties are located on Old Village Road, on a hill above the Deerfield River known as Old Village Hill, and are the oldest surviving elements of the town's early colonial settlement. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history Shelburne's Old Village Hill is located in a rural setting north of Massachusetts Route 2, at the top of a hill east of Dragon Brook traversed by Old Village Road. The cemetery occupies about on the west side of the road, with the Hubbard House on an adjacent parcel to its north. The cemetery has about 250 grave markers, the majority of which are slate. Markers placed before the 20th century are for the most part oriented to face west, toward the setting sun, a typical practice of the period. Later markers tend to be granite or marble, and are usually oriented to face the road. The Hubbard House is a 2-1/2 story frame structure, with a gabled roof, two interior brick chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. A single-story porch extends across its front, and an ell, possibly older than the main block, extends to the left. The main facade is five bays wide, with a central entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom window set in a corniced entablature. The interior of the house retains a great deal of original woodwork and other finishes, including plaster walls and wooden floors. The land that is now Shelburne was originally part of the colonial settlement of Deerfield, and was divided amongst that town's proprietors in 1742. The area of the cemetery and house were part of a tract set aside as common land. Permanent settlement began in the late 1750s, and its first meeting house was built sometime before 1769 on the cemetery grounds. Neither it, nor the second meeting house built in 1773, have survived. The cemetery has seen continuous use since the 18th century, and includes many of Shelburne's early settlers. The rate of burials decreased significantly beginning in the 1860s. The Parson Hubbard House was built in the 1770s for Shelburne's first minister, Robert Hubbard. Resistance activities related to Shays' Rebellion in the 1780s took place at the Hubbard house. These are the only major colonial-era historic properties in Shelburne; the meetinghouses from the period that were built in this area have not survived.

The district is centered on the junction of several roads, around which the center of the town grew. South Road arrives from the south, East Main Street and Bray Road from the east, Ledge Road from the north, and West Main Street from the west. The first European settlement in what is now Heath was Fort Shirley, built in 1744 to defend the frontier of Massachusetts against French and Native American attacks. Permanent residents began to settle the area in the 1750s, and what is now Heath Center began to organize in 1765, when the area was still part of Charlemont. Originally known as Charlemont Hill, Heath was incorporated in 1785. In 1789 the nucleus of its civic center was determined by the placement of the meetinghouse and common on land of Benjamin Maxwell. The center includes a cluster of well-preserved late colonial (Georgian) and early Federal style homes, and a number of institutional buildings that date from the 19th century. The only major Greek Revival building is the Old Town Hall, built in 1835. All of the village's churches date to later periods: the Union Evangelical Church is a Gothic Revival structure built in 1835, and the Methodist Church was built in 1872 in the Italianate style. The dominant style of the district's houses is Federal, although there are a few examples of later 19th-century and early 20th-century styles also to be seen.

The Colonial Revival block was completed in 1929, and is home to the city's largest theatrical performance venue. The theater is a unique example of an \\"atmospheric\\" garden theater, with artwork and mechanical systems designed to give its interior an outside appearance. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and included in the Main Street Historic District in 1988. The theater is now known as the Greenfield Garden Cinemas. Description and history The Garden Theater Block is located on the south side of Main Street in downtown Greenfield, just east of Bank Row. It is a steel-framed structure, with a two-story front section finished in brick and stone with Colonial Revival styling. The facade is divided into seven sections, articulated by stone pilasters. The outer sections are all commercial storefronts, with recessed entrances flanked by display windows on the ground floor, and two sash windows on the upper level. The central bay houses the theater entrance, which is deeply recessed and sheltered by a large marquee. The windows above the marquee are topped by rounded blinds, and the bay is capped by a gable. The interior of the theater is richly decorated with garden-themed carpeting and murals of New England scenes by noted theater muralist Frederick Marshall. The ceiling includes lighting panels designed to simulate stars, some of which twinkle, and there is machinery for simulating the movement of clouds across the ceiling. The theater was built in 1928-29 to a design by Mowll & Rand of Boston for the Goldman family who owned a theater chain across western Massachusetts. It was at the time the third theater in Greenfield, and its largest. Although it was designed for both film and live performance, it only sporadically showed vaudeville productions before being dedicated entirely to films. The theater was operated by the Goldman family for 70 years, closing in 1999. The city thereafter took the property in a tax proceeding, but the Goldmans were able to recover it through further legal action. The theater was then divided into seven smaller theaters, and its murals were covered over. The Goldmans leased the theater operation out, and the lessees acquired the property in 2008, with further plans for rehabilitation.

History Los Altos was built in 1925 and designed by Edward B. Rust and Luther Mayo. In 1999, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. When built, the Los Altos Apartments began as a co-op and were later used as a luxury apartment and hotel catering to stars like Clara Bow, Bette Davis, Mae West, Douglas Fairbanks, and William Randolph Hearst. The Spanish Colonial-style building went bankrupt during the Great Depression and fell into disrepair. In 1993, a local housing group Neighborhood Effort rescued the structure from demolition and obtained national historic site status by tracking down its original parts and design details such as floor tiles, doorknobs, and colors. In the 1980s the building became a magnet for a bohemian list of residents. Jeff Ayeroff, who went on to co-found Virgin Records America, and The WORK Group lived in the building as did screenwriter Becky Johnston while she wrote the scripts “Under the Cherry Moon” for Prince and “The Prince of Tides” for Barbra Streisand. Artists Nancy Reese, Phil Garner, Eric Blum and Tom Shannon all rented living quarters and art dealers Tom Jancar and Richard Kuhlenschmidt opened the Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery in the basement of the building. New York hotshots Richard Prince and Louise Lawler had their first L.A. exhibitions there. Actor Frederic Forrest was living at the Los Altos when he turned in his critically acclaimed performance in Francis Ford Coppola’s 1988 film “Tucker: The Man and His Dream”, as did musician Tommy Gear, who was a founding member of revered L.A. punk group The Screamers. Los Angeles-based architectural firm M2A rehabilitated the 75-unit structure, and restored its original decor. The firm restored or recreated Los Altos’ original light fixtures, hardware, carpets, plaster work, awnings, and ornamental iron work. The rehabilitation \\"successfully transformed the property from a vacant, blighted, graffiti-infested building into a healthy, mixed-income building serving the very low income population as well as the market population.\\"LOS ALTOS APARTMENTS, LP v. City of Los Angeles, No. B222174 (Cal. Ct. App. July 7, 2011)(rent abatement for housing code violations). Today, Los Altos is the home to artists, screenwriters, and actors. In 1999, Los Altos received several preservation design awards from the California Preservation Foundation and the Los Angeles Conservancy. The landmark also received a Historic Preservation Award of Excellence from the city of Los Angeles. Popular culture The television series Angel prominently featured exterior shots of the Los Altos Apartments, in seasons 2 - 4, it acted as the exterior of the Hyperion Hotel, the home and base of titular character and his friends. The 'Los Altos Apartments' building was also featured in a season 1 episode of Angel called \\"I Fall To Pieces\\", where it was used as both exterior and interior for the apartment building of a guest character. In the fifth episode of the second season of the television series Numb3rs, called Assassin, the building was used as the exterior of the Rancho Verde Assisted Living building. In the Amazon television series Transparent, the character Ali lives in the Los Altos Apartments; several exteriors, including scenes in the courtyard entry, are featured in seasons 1 and 2.

Joseph Griswold House, also sometimes referred to as the Mary Lyon House, is a historic house on Upper Street in Buckland, Massachusetts. Built in 1818, it is one of the region's finest examples of residential Federal period architecture. It is further notable for its association with pioneering women's educator Mary Lyon, who operated a school here before establishing Mount Holyoke College. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Description and history The Major Joseph Griswold House is located on the western edge of the village center of Buckland, set on a knoll high above the north side of Upper Street. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a gabled roof, and a long wood-frame ell extending to the rear. There are four chimneys, two set in each sidewall. The brick of the front facade is laid in Flemish bond, and the window openings are trimmed with marble. The main facade is five bays wide, with the entrance at the center, framed by slender pilasters and a half-round fanlight. The side gable ends each have a pair of windows, with a fanlight near the peak of the gable. These windows provide illumination to a large ballroom space occupying the attic level. The house was built in 1818 for Major Joseph Griswold, who was the son of an American Revolutionary War soldier. The Federal-style house, designed by Asher Benjamin is a large brick structure, three stories tall, with four chimneys. The house was a center of the town's social scene, with Griswold opening the third floor ballroom for public events. Between 1824 and 1829, Griswold allowed Buckland native Mary Lyon to establish a school for women in that space. She used it until 1829, and thereafter began to seek larger facilities to meet demand. This resulted in the 1837 establishment of what is now Mount Holyoke College.

About a year later, Hecht's became Strawbridge's. During the Strawbridge's years, it had a bargain basement in which all furniture and goods were marked down by 80%. Following Federated Department Stores' acquisition of May Department Stores in 2005, Strawbridge's was rebranded as Macy's. The mall is also home to one of Philadelphia's oldest and most notable cheesesteak restaurant chains, Jim's Steaks, which was founded in West Philadelphia in 1939 and also operates on South Street in Philadelphia. Great Northeast Plaza Located directly across from Roosevelt Mall is Great Northeast Plaza, which was formerly anchored by Sears. Prior to Sears, it was anchored by Gimbels.

In 1675 the Wampanoag chief Metacom, colloquially called \\"King Philip\\" by English colonists, is claimed to have held council here during King Philip's War. The hill has evidence of what appears to be trenches and other remnants of fortification from the time, but the exact nature of these is debatable; 19th century area historian George Sheldon believed the trenches to be the work of a colonist. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. It is now owned by the town, with a trail that loops around and over the hill, with informational signs along the way.

The district includes the town hall, county courthouse, several 19th century bank buildings, and three properties previously listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Garden Theater Block, the Leavitt-Hovey House (which houses the public library), and the 1915 Post Office building. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Greenfield was settled in the 17th century as part of Deerfield, and was incorporated as a town in 1775. The town center was by then already established on Main Street, with a variety of businesses and residences, none of which have survived. Major travel routes, both north-south and east-west, where developed in the late 18th century that met there. The town became the shire town of Franklin County when it was established in 1811, and a series of civic buildings took shape thereafter in the Bank Row/Court Square area. Commercial development extended east from that area as the 19th century progressed, although a few older homes survived this process, including the Leavitt-Hovey House. Further development was spurred by the arrival of railroads in the mid-19th century, and the late 19th century was the town's period of greatest industrial and economic growth.

Montague Center, one of the town's five villages, is the civic heart of the town, and was also an active industrial area in the 19th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The village of Montague Center, one of five, is located in the central-southern part of the incorporated Town of Montague, with the Saw Mill River flowing generally westward on the north and east sides of the village. Main Street runs through the village with a minor westward jog in the center of the village, deviating from its generally northerly track. The east-west portion of this jog has a triangular green at its eastern end, with Center Street running eastward and North Street running north. Further south on Main Street is a smaller triangle that forms the split-tail end of Old Sunderland Road at Main Street. In this triangular green is a tall sign-post box with several 18th-century signs giving directions to nearby towns, one of which is purportedly fake. Originally the entirety of the town, splitting off from Sunderland in 1752, Montague Center took shape in the 19th century as the site of an early gristmill and the intersection of two east-west and north-south roads. Main Street is where the most significant buildings in the village lie, along with North and Center Streets, which line the town common. A school and two churches from the 1830s flanked the common, as did the 1858 town hall, now the village library. The oldest building in the district is the Root Tavern that dates to about 1734, now a home.

Description and history The land that now makes up New Salem was granted in 1734 to citizens of Salem, Massachusetts, and was settled in 1737. It flourished as a rural community based on lumber and agriculture, with the town center benefiting economically as a stagecoach stop on the route between Worcester and Brattleboro, Vermont. The town center was originally laid out in 1737, including a large common, of which the present two-acre common is a surviving remnant. Other early elements of the center include the town pound, a stone enclosure built to house stray livestock, and the cemetery. The town center was bypassed by the railroads in the 19th century, and the town subsequently stagnated economically and declined in population. The historic district extends along South Main Street, from East and West Main Street in the north to Lovers Lane in the south. It is about in size, with 43 historic buildings.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Assafarge e Antanhol. It has a population of 2268 inhabitants (2001 Census) and occupies an area of . History The earliest histories of this region include the discovery of a polished stone implement, although there are no records prior to Roman intersession in the territory. The unearthing, between the localities of Carvalhais de Cima and Carvalhais de Baixo, of several irregular cavities allude to Moorish influence in the zone. It is also likely that local peoples may have dugout these holes in order to discover the treasure of the Moors, which they assumed was buried in the spaces. The local toponymy had its base in these early Arab settlers; the name, sometimes written as Açafarge, Açafargel, Safarge, Assafarja, Azofargelas, Azofarge, Asafarge, Assofragea or Alçoforge, may have originated from the Arabic Açafargel (plural Açafarge), which refers to the pome fruit quince. Evidence from historical documents suggest that the parish was founded around the 12th century (although no definitive record exists), and originated from its de-annexation (in 1120) from the neighbouring parish of Castelo Viegas. Geography The civil parish is located along the southern border of the municipality of Coimbra, with the municipality of Condeixa-a-Nova (civil parish of Bem da Fé and Vila Seca). Its municipal neighbours include the parishes of Almalaguês (to the southeast), Castelo Viegas (to the northeast), Santa Clara (in the north), Antanhol (in the northwest), and Cernache (in the southwest). Situated on a hilltop plateau overlooking the Mondego River, the region is marked by limestone hills covered in pine forests, dispersed by vineyards. By the end of the 20th century, the growth of the parish originated in its proximity to Coimbra; the resident population in 1981 was 1,714, grew slightly to 1,886 (in 1991), reaching approximately 2,200 inhabitants by 1998.

UNRWA and Palestinian \\"refugees\\"  Religion, Politics, and the Origins of Palestine Refugee Relief, the 2013 book Romirowsky co- authored with Alexander H. Joffe, examines the origins of the UNRWA in the endorsement by the British authorities in Mandatory Palestine of efforts by the American Friends Service Committee to assist Arab refugees during and after the 1947–1949 Palestine war. Romirowsky and Joffe argue that the UNRWA's attitude towards Israel is rooted in the \\"foundational belief\\" of the American Friends Service Committee \\"in a supersessionist Christianity that could not reconcile the possibility of a rebirth of Jewish nationhood in the Land of Israel.\\" Romirowsky argues that because of the tendency of UNRWA schools and personnel to abet terrorism, especially in Gaza, many of its functions should be turned over to the Palestinian Authority. According to Ruth Wisse, Romirowsky argues that the \\"unique nature\\" of the UNRWA, which perpetuates the refugee status of Palestinian Arabs rather than resettle them, has had the effect of prolonging \\"suffering and anger\\" which then becomes \\"a weapon to encourage [generations] toward terrorism and intransigence.\\" Romirowsky is in favor of normalizing the definition of Palestinian refugees to conform with the usual practice of defining only persons who fled, and not their descendants, as \\"refugees.\\" Marouf Hasian Jr., who supports the inclusion of all descendants of Palestinian refugees as \\"refugees,\\" accuses Romirowsky of minimizing the difficulties faced by Palestinian Arabs and the \\"horrors of refugee life.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Scholars for Peace in the Middle East Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Middle Eastern studies in the United States Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Category:Villanova University alumni Category:West Chester University alumni ","title":"Asaf Romirowsky"},{"id":"18721159","text":"Drumry is a district in the Scottish town of Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, split into North and South Drumry by its main thoroughfare, Drumry Road.

If the stone projects from a flat flint wall then the term is proudwork, as the stone stands \\"proud\\" rather than being \\"flush\\" with the wall. Flushworked buildings belong to the Perpendicular style of English Gothic architecture. It is characteristic of the external walls of medieval buildings – most of the survivors being churches – in parts of Southern England and especially East Anglia. Flushwork begins in the early 14th century, but the peak period was during the wool boom between about 1450 and the English Reformation of the 1520s, when church building virtually ceased and brick construction became more fashionable. The technique continued in occasional use, and saw a major revival in the 19th century, and is still sometimes used in a modern style today, as well as for the restoration or extension of older buildings. Technique Flushwork, and flint architecture in general, is usually found in areas with no good local building stone. Although the labour cost of creating flushwork was high, it was still cheaper than importing the large quantity of stone necessary to build or face the entire structure. The flints in flushwork areas are very carefully knapped (trimmed to shape by chipping) and selected for fit and consistency of colour. The stone usually used is a light limestone, often imported by sea and river from Caen in Normandy or other continental sources, which gives a strong contrast with flint that is most often black. The decorative patterns often form a notable contrast in these respects to those in nearby plain wall areas. Uses Typical motifs are arcades, chequers (diapering), shields, heraldic devices, and letters or whole inscriptions. Many motifs are very similar to those achieved in carved or pierced stonework in other areas. As with carved stone decoration, it is most common to find friezes at the base or top of a wall, or a decorated parapet (again often a later addition) to the top of a tower. Few churches have flushwork all over the main body of the building. An exception is Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford. Porches added to an earlier church often contain showy flushwork, as at the church that is now Chelmsford Cathedral. Sometimes large areas are covered with chequerwork or diapering, where blocks of stone (often light coloured limestone such as Chilmark Stone or chalk, or greensand) are alternated with panels of dressed flint in a chequerboard pattern. This style is a characteristic of Wiltshire architecture, both vernacular and ecclesiastical. Chequerwork is also found in East Anglia, such as on the Norwich Guildhall (pictured below), the Chapel of St Nicholas in Gipping, or the Victorian St Mary-le-Tower in Ipswich. Examples The Ethelbert Gate at Norwich Cathedral is one of the most important surviving examples of early flushwork, begun in 1316–17 and completed the following decade. Only nine surviving gatehouses use flushwork, and this one is further distinguished by using it on all four elevations. (The heraldic priory gatehouse at Butley, Suffolk, of 1325 is another flamboyant early example.Photographs available at the Butley Priory website.) The side pictured here has elaborate patterned flushwork in the top register, which uses selected round flints in the circular motifs; this section was unfortunately restored in the 19th century slightly differently from the original design. The limestone is unusually dominant in the proudwork level with the statue below, where the squared flints are selected for a whitish colour. Below this there are two rows of black flint and limestone chequers. Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford, Suffolk, is widely regarded as one of the finest wool churches in England. It displays arcading at four levels, shields, and a long inscription running below the crenellations; the inscription names the merchants who paid for the new church. The church of Stratford St Mary also displays long inscriptions, invoking prayers for the church's patrons. According to Stephen Hart, there are over 500 English churches with some flushwork. Among the finest not mentioned above are St Edmund's Church in Southwold, the Church of Saint Mary in Woolpit, the church in Earl Soham, and several in Norwich. The unique, and odd, east end of the church at Barsham, Suffolk, has a lattice pattern that continues from the window across the whole wall, although the date is highly uncertain.

It encompasses two parcels of land, one on each side of Church Street between South and Library Streets, totalling . The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. There are four buildings on these parcels, the most notable of which is the Italianate Powers Institute building. Its construction was funded by a bequest from Bernardston native Edward Eppes Powers (1793-1855), and it was built in 1857 on land donated by a number of local residents. The building was intended to serve the town's secondary school needs, but its reach expanded with the construction in 1860 of Cushman Hall, a dormitory located across the street. Land and funds for its construction came from Henry Cushman, a local resident who served as atrustee of the Powers bequest, and played a role in the institute's administration. Thereafter the school also took in students from further afield. Cushman in 1862 also funded the construction of the Cushman Library, which was built next to the institute. Upon the death of Henry Cushman, Cushman Hall was willed to the town, with the provision that income from its use go toward a park on the adjacent land. He also endowed the library, which was one of the first to be built in the area. Cushman's gift was expanded upon in 1900, when the family of John Sanderson donated funds to expand the library building, adding a second floor. The Power Institute remained a successful public-private academy until 1891, at which point it was transitioned to operate as a more conventional secondary high school for area residents. Cushman Hall ceased to be used as a dormitory, and was converted into apartments. In 1958 the school was closed, and has since been converted for use by the Bernardston Historical Society.

The site added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Site description The Riverside Archeological District encompasses a sizable tract of land north of Turners Falls, a major whitewater rapids on the Connecticut River, north of the eponymous village of Turners Falls, Massachusetts in Gill and Greenfield. Located in northern Massachusetts near the mouths of four major tributaries to the Connecticut, the area has an archaeological history known to date back to the late Pleistocene. During the earliest contacts between European colonists and Native Americans in the 17th century, the area was known to house major Native encampments, and was the site of the 1676 Battle of Turner's Falls in King Philip's War. The area has been recognized has archaeologically significant since the 19th century, with well-attested accounts of small finds and some distinctive burial sites. Formalized archaeology in the area began in the early 20th century with the accumulation of artifacts from Gill in 1915 and 1916 that are now in the collection of the American Indian Archaeological Institute in Washington, DC. It has continued at low levels of activity throughout the 20th century. Boundaries The western boundary of the site is roughly Adams Street in Greenfield; the eastern boundary is in the Lily's Pond area of Barton Cove in Gill, a sheltered area of the Connecticut River. The northern boundary is just north of Riverside Cemetery in Gill, and the southernmost portion of the area may extend just across the river into the village of Turners Falls.

This image from 1900, is one of several posed with a pistol. (Photo from Yale University Libraries collection.) Abraham Lincoln Artman Himmelwright (February 7, 1865 – March 24, 1936), a civil engineer, author, builder, adventurer, and marksman was the general manager of The Roebling Construction Company, the New York City firm created by John A. Roebling's Sons Company of Trenton, New Jersey. Himmelwright's first and second names were given to him by his parents to honor the slain president, Abraham Lincoln, assassinated the year Himmelwright was born. In most of the works he authored he went by the name \\"ALA Himmelwright\\". Biography He was born on February 7, 1865, in Milford, Pennsylvania.Passport application of 24 May 1919 In 1894 he was with the Carlin hunting party which left its cook, George Colgate behind to die. He purchased land in the Stockholm section of Hardyston Township, New Jersey and in 1907 completed a fireproof house made of stone. He died in 1936. Publications Himmelwright authored many books and articles, including a harrowing tale of a hunting trip in the Bitterroot Mountains of Idaho and a first-hand account of the famous Johnstown flood in Pennsylvania, published in Harper's Magazine. The former recounted the fate of the \\"Carlin Hunting Party\\", in which Himmelwright participated. He wrote the account under the pseudonym Heclawa because of the national notoriety which occurred when the disaster reached the nation's newspapers. The group's cook, George Colgate, died in difficult but disputed circumstances and some accused the men of abandoning him needlessly. For a discussion of the matter not entirely sympathetic to Himmelwright, see Ladd Hamilton's Snowbound (1997).Hamilton, Ladd: Snowbound. Washington State University Press, January, 1997 . For Himmelright's perspective, see his book In the Heart of the Bitter-Root Mountains. Himmelwright's books on pistol shooting technique were among the most popular American books on the subject and remained in print from 1904 into the early 1940s. He was president of the U.S. Revolver Association, an early sport governing body, from 1904–1906 and won the Association's inaugural national revolver shooting championship match in 1900. An expert on the danger of fire, in 1899 The Roebling Construction Company published the first of many articles and books by Himmelwright concerning fireproof construction, \\"Tests of the Roebling System of Fireproof Construction\\". In 1906, The Roebling Construction Company sought to reinforce its brand and expertise in fireproof development when it published the Himmelwright book, The San Francisco Earthquake and Fire : A Brief History of the Disaster ; A Presentation of Facts and Resulting Phenomena, With Special Reference to the Efficiency of Building Materials, Lessons of the Disaster. The catastrophic scale of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake spurned an era of innovation and adoption of new building technology, including reinforced concrete developed by inventors like Ernest L. Ransome. The Model Fireproof Farmhouse at Rock Lodge Plaque on model farmhouse. Two years prior to the publication of The San Francisco Earthquake and Fire, Himmelwright set out to personally prove the merits of fireproof construction, adding to his thinking a philosophy of environmental engineering, sustainable building and permaculture. He purchased of land about from New York City in Stockholm, New Jersey, and in 1907 completed the construction of what he called, a \\"Model Fireproof Farm House\\". Fire is a big danger on farms, and Himmewright believed it could be prevented with the use of stone found in the immediate environment. The setting for what is now known as \\"the Stone House\\" is on a hill or knoll and is in use today as a residence and overnight rental facility at the nonprofit Rock Lodge Club, a nudist resort. To give the setting a picturesque feel, and to provide for scenic views from the model fireproof farmhouse, Himmelwright dredged land below the knoll and built a spring-fed lake, now known as Rock Lodge Pond, a popular summertime nudist swimming destination that is considered the centerpiece of Rock Lodge Club. When first constructed, features of the model fireproof farmhouse included a state-of-the-art wood fired water system which pumped spring water to a third-floor holding tank; a coal fired furnace with radiators in each room for heat; a similarly stone built garage of sufficient size to accommodate two large touring cars; and awnings and shutters with a concrete sidewalk all around. The model fireproof farm house built by engineer ALA Himmelwright in 1907 and presently used as a residence and overnight rental facility at Rock Lodge Club. This photograph is circa 1938. The walls are of granite, the floors and ceilings of poured concrete with steel reinforcement, the roof is lined with copper. Woodwork, plaster, brickwork, and concrete were all specced to be of \\"first class materials and workmanship\\". Himmelwright estimated its lifespan at 400–500 years. In 1913, Himmelwright published detailed engineering plans, drawings, and instructions on how to build replicas of the Stone House in a book, A Model Fire-Proof Farm House or Country Home: Practical Suggestions for Economical and Enduring Construction, With Complete Plans and Specifications of A Model Building, dedicated to his son Kenneth who had drowned in the lake in 1911 at age 14. The book was first published by The Neale Publishing Company of New York, and republished by Rock Lodge Club on the 100th anniversary of its building in 2007. Himmelwright was an environmentalist before his time whose belief in sustainable building practices is strongly stated in his preface to A Model Fire-Proof Farm House. He wrote: > \\"A new epoch in home building is at hand. The wasteful, shortsighted and > ephemeral methods of the past have become intolerable, and on account of our > depleted timber supply, will soon be impossible.A sketch of the model > fireproof farm house in Himmelwright's building plans published in 1913. > This view is of the North Elevation.The conservation of the world's natural > resources is attracting universal attention, and will undoubtedly receive a > large portion of the best thought and consideration of the present > generation.

Its > deterioration is inappreciable for from ten to twenty generations, during > which time it retains its full original value, plus the added value due to > the subsequent development and improvement of the section in which it is > located.

Description and history The Arthur A. Smith Covered Bridge is located west of Colrain's village center, carrying Lyonsville Road across the North River a short way west of Massachusetts Route 112. The bridge is long, with an outside width of and an inside width of , sufficient for one lane of traffic. Much of the slate on its gabled roof was reclaimed from the original bridge roof. The exterior is windowless with vertical pine board siding. The structure is of a Burr Truss. Ten braced king posts are tensioned by sweeping segmented timber arches that sandwich the braced posts. In 1920 the bridge was strengthened with the addition two great laminated lumber arches. 2\\" X 12\\" spruce planks were bent and stacked to arch from abutment to abutment following the curve of the original Burr Truss arch. Threaded steel rods hang from these arches to hold the bridge deck support beams. The bridge was built in 1869 to cross the North River in Colrain Massachusetts close to where it is joined by the Fox Brook. The site is vulnerable to flooding and the Fox Bridge was soon severely damaged by flood in 1878. It then sat abandoned until 1896, when the town voted to rehabilitate it and moved it to its present location, where it served as part of the main road to Heath. The area was then known as the \\"Arthur A. Smith Flats\\", after a prominent local resident who lived in the area. In 1982 it was taken out of service and moved to adjacent land. Following a $2.1M rebuilding in 2007 a recreation of the Arthur A Smith was placed back over the river but was not opened to vehicular traffic. The Bridge was only slightly damaged during the record flooding of hurricane Irene in 2011. This is due to its having been placed on abutments that lift it high above the surrounding floodplain.

The properties in the district largely still follow the plan of the town when it was first laid out in 1714. The predominant architectural style in the district is Greek Revival, but there are fine examples of Georgian and Federalist architecture, as well as a number of late 19th and early 20th century architectural styles. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The area that became Sunderland was occupied by Native Americans until the 1670s, when it was purchased from them by English settlers; the single largest purchased traded much of the land for 80 fathoms of wampum. The settlement, known as Swampfield, was abandoned during King Philip's War (1675–78), and was not reestablished until 1714. At that time, Main Street was laid out along what had been a Native American trail, with a width of eight rods, and land parcels with frontage of fourteen rods were allotted to settlers. Land for the town cemetery was set aside, as was common land and a parcel for a minister.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History The village of Turners Falls was founded in the 1790s, when a canal was dug around the falls of the Connecticut River as part of a water-based transportation network. The canal remained in operation until the 1840s, when more reliable railroad transport rendered it obsolete. In 1867, Alvah Crocker, a businessman from Fitchburg, sought to harness the river's power for industrial use, and purchased the rights of the defunct transport canal. Crocker and his partners replaced the transpor canal with a larger power canal, where the water power could be sold to adjacent businesses. Adjacent to the power canal, Crocker laid out a grid of streets (numbered in one orientation, lettered in the other), with Avenue A as its principal thoroughfare. The first major business to locate there was the Russell Manufacturing Company, a Greenfield-based manufacturer of cutlery. Its plant, which has not survived, was the largest cutlery factory in the world at its greatest extent. The most prominent surviving industrial works are those of the Keith Paper Company, which was founded in 1871 but whose oldest buildings date to 1877.

After abortive negotiations with the Australian division of EMI Records, Spin Productions signed an exclusive ten-year distribution agreement with Festival Records and the first three Spin singles, released to coincide with the re- branding, were Ray Columbus' \\"We Want A Beat\\", Jeff St John & The Id's debut recording \\"Lindy Lou\\", and Marty Rhone's \\"Nature Boy\\". Spin releases played an important part in Festival's business in that period, releasing successful albums and singles, including the 1969 hit single \\"Mr Guy Fawkes\\" by The Dave Miller Set, and the original Australian cast recording of the rock musical Hair, which became the first Australian cast recording to earn a Gold Record award. Through Kipner, Spin was also able to secure the lucrative Australian release rights to the Bee Gees' Polydor recordings from 1967 until the Spin label folded in 1973. The early Spin releases were produced (or co-produced with Ossie Byrne) by Nat Kipner, or by noted producer-arranger Bill Shepherd, who accompanied the Bee Gees to the UK in 1967 as their musical director. From 1967, following the collapse of Ivan Dayman's Sunshine label, its acquisition by Festival, and his subsequent appointment as a Festival house producer, musician-composer-producer Pat Aulton took on a central role in Spin's productions, and he produced a large proportion of the label's output in the late '60s and early '70s. In 1966, Spin played a pivotal role in the Bee Gees story, issuing the group's final batch of Australian singles, including their first major Australian hit, \\"Spicks and Specks\\", released in September that year. It was one of Spin's most successful singles, spending 19 weeks in the Sydney charts, where it peaked at #3. It went to #1 in other cities including Melbourne, and reached #1 on the newly-established national Top 40 in Go-Set magazine, which also named it \\"Best Record of the Year\\". The Bee Gees had originally signed to Festival's subsidiary Leedon Records, established by promoter Lee Gordon in the 1950s, and which Festival had acquired after Gordon's untimely death. According to Bee Gees historian Joseph Brennan, Festival was on the verge of dropping The Bee Gees from Leedon in late 1965, after eleven successive chart failures, although the band, and their manager and father Hugh Gibb, felt that much of the blame lay with Festival itself, and that the company had done little to promote their recordings. (It is notable that several other Australian performers had scored local hits with songs written by the Gibb brothers during the same period.) Hugh Gibb also questioned the legality of the boys' contract—they were all under 18 when they signed with Leedon—but Festival managing director Fred Marks negotiated a compromise, agreeing to release the trio from their Leedon contract on condition that they transfer to the Spin label. It was at that point that Nat Kipner briefly took over from Hugh Gibb as the Bee gees' manager, until they moved back to the UK at the start of 1967, when they signed a new management contract with Robert Stigwood and the NEMS organisation. Once signed to Spin, Nat Kipner's support and guidance proved invaluable to The Bee Gees' career, as did the production skills and support of independent producer and studio owner Ossie Byrne. Over several months during mid-1966, Byrne gave the Gibb brothers virtually unlimited time in his St Clair Studio in Hurstville, Sydney and the Gibbs have acknowledged that Byrne's generosity and guidance were crucial in enabling them to find their feet as studio artists. Despite Festival's earlier misgivings, the deal proved lucrative for both Spin and Festival. After they arrived in Britain, The Bee Gees signed with Stigwood's RSO Records (distributed by Polydor) for the UK, and Atlantic Records in the USA, but Spin (and therefore Festival) retained the exclusive rights to distribute The Bee Gees' recordings in Australia for the better part of a decade. The first Bee Gees single released under that arrangement was their international breakthrough hit \\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\\" (1967). Spin released some of the best local and international singles of the late Sixties, including all of The Bee Gees late '60s UK recordings. Artists on the Spin roster included former Aztecs guitarist Tony Barber, Steve & The Board (led by Nat Kipner's son and future hit songwriter Steve Kipner), Ronnie Burns, Toni McCann, Ray Columbus, Jeff St John, Marty Rhone, Tony Summers, Chris Hall & The Torquays, The Sunsets (later renamed Tamam Shud), The Ram Jam Big Band, Janice Slater, The Dave Miller Set, and expatriate Hungarian fusion group Syrius, which featured legendary Australian jazz-funk bassist Jackie Orczarsky. Harry M. Miller's interest in the label also led to Spin releasing the highly-successful Australian cast recording of Hair in 1970, the first Australian stage cast recording LP to be awarded a Gold Record. The label was very productive, releasing 116 singles, 35 EPs and 38 LPs over the eight years between May 1966 and May 1974. Spin typically released 2-3 singles per month during its peak years. All Spin recordings were manufactured and distributed by Festival Records. Up to 1973, all singles distributed by Festival were catalogued in a consecutive four-figure series, with the different labels identified by prefixes. Festival's own releases (and some of the overseas recordings it released under license) were identified with a \\"FK\\" prefix (e.g. FK-1340). Spin singles were identified by the prefix \\"EK\\", an artefact of its original incarnation as \\"Everybody's\\". The final Spin single release, one of only two in Festaival's new \\"K\\" series (1973–74), was the Bee Gees' \\"Mr Natural\\". Spin's EP and LP releases were similarly catalogued; Festival catalogued all EPs in its consecutive '11000' series, prefixed with a two- letter ID prefix (Spin's was \\"EX\\"). Spin LPs were initially catalogued in Festival's '30000' series and identified with an \\"EL\\" prefix\\". That series changed to Festival's '930000' series ca. 1967. Early Spin LPs were released in mono; Jeff St John & The Id's Big Time Operators (1967) was Spin's first stereo LP, and one of the first stereo pop music albums by an Australian group. The original Australian cast recording of The Boy Friend (Sep. 1968) was the last Spin LP to be released in mono. Spin's last two LPs—The Bee Gees' compilation Double Gold, and Mr Natural (1974) were issued under Festival's new L series catalogue. Spin Productions went into liquidation in mid-1974 and the company's catalogue was subsequently purchased by Festival. The Spin name was revived briefly in 2000 for what was planned as an extensive series of commemorative CDs that were to have been issued to mark the company's 50th anniversary, but the project was cancelled after only a few releases, due to cost-cutting and restructures. Despite those measures, Festival Mushroom went into liquidation in mid-2005 and its entire recording archive—including the Spin catalogue—was sold to the Australian division of Warner Music in October 2005, for a reported AU$10 million.

The main structure exemplifies the organic growth of a farm complex from colonial days into the 19th century. The main block of the house is a Federal style 2-1/2 story center chimney structure, built c. 1820. A wing added onto the main block's west side is built in part on a foundation dating to 1740; this section of the house was apparently built in 1794, tearing down the earlier 1740 construction. This wing is attached at its other end to a 19th-century barn. The origins of this farmstead lie in the movements of Samuel Hinsdale (1708–86), whose father Mehuman, a tavern owner, was taken captive by Native Americans in the 1704 Raid on Deerfield. The elder Hinsdale died in 1736, willing this land, then still part of Deerfield to his son, who apparently built here around 1740, the year before his son was born. Not long afterward, Hinsdale was known to operating a tavern, for which he was formally licensed in 1747, although it is unclear if the license was for this location. Hinsdale was elected to the first board of selectmen when the Greenfield was separated from Deerfield in 1753. By 1787, when his estate was inventoried, Hinsdale had unambiguously been operating a tavern here, as well as a cooper's shop. The tavern continued to be operated by his sons. After 1836 the tavern was operated by others, and was closed in 1860, apparently due to the temperance movement. In the later part of the 19th century the property, then , was used primarily for agricultural purposes by the Smith family, whose descendants occupied the property until 1997. Now much reduced in size, the property is operated as a bed and breakfast inn, reviving its earlier use as a service to travelers. The farmstead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

Centered on a town common established in 1782, it includes a significant number of well preserved Greek Revival buildings. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The hill town of Wendell, located in eastern Franklin County, was settled in 1754 and incorporated in 1781. Its town center, roughly located at its geographic center, dates to the period of incorporation, when a meetinghouse (no longer standing) was built, and the town common and cemetery were laid out. The oldest surviving building, the Congregational parsonage, was built in 1823. The immediate area surrounding the center has remained rural into the 20th century, with the town's modest industry centered at Wendell Depot to the north. The town's population gradually decreased over much of the 19th century, leaving a town center with a significant number of Greek Revival buildings from the 1840s. The historic district is centered on the town common, which is a rectangular plot of land, about , bounded on the west by Lock's Village Road and Depot Road, and is roughly bisected by Morse Village Road. It is bounded on its north, east, and south by Center Road. The sides of the roads opposite the common are lined with institutional buildings and houses that are predominantly in the Greek Revival style and date to the first half of the 19th century. The only contributing 20th-century building is the Colonial Revival library, built 1921. The town hall, located in the district, is a Greek Revival building that was probably once a Baptist church built in 1845. There is one other church building, that of the Congregationalists; it was built in 1846. There is one school in the district; it is a typical 19th- century district schoolhouse, also built in 1846.

The area, located in the foothills of The Berkshires above the Connecticut River, has a long agricultural history, but also experienced a surge of industrial activity in the 19th century, of which only fragments remain. The district, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003, is focused on the areas surrounding West Brook and the areas where there was once industrial activity. From the late 18th century into the early 20th, there were some 16 mill complexes in the area, of which only one still has a surviving structure. The principal elements that survive of this industrial past are foundations and evidence of water works such as dams and millraces. There are only two institutional buildings in the district: the West Whately Chapel, built in the Queen Anne style in 1896, and a schoolhouse that has since been converted to a residence. The oldest documented mill privilege on West Brook was granted about 1765 to Edward Brown, who operated a sawmill with his sons. This mill site was active into the 1920s, and was probably one of the longest-lived industrial sites. Privileges granted in the 1780s include one that was initially used for an oil mill, and another that included both grist and saw mills. At the mid-19th century, the area was that of the largest non-agricultural employment in the town, and also had several shops. The water-powered industries suffered due to reduced waterflows after the Northampton Reservoir was built in 1901, and most of the buildings were gone by the 1920s.

Located in the hills west of the Connecticut River and north of Northampton, the district consists of a stretch of Chestnut Plain Road, the main north-south route through the village, and a short stretch of Haydenville Road, which is roughly at the center of the district. There are many fine homes from the Federal period, although they often have embellishments from later periods. Greek Revival architecture is also a major presence, with numerous houses, as well as the town's civic centerpieces, the town hall (c. 1844) and Second Congregational Church (c. 1843), showing that style. There are only a modest number of 20th century structures in the district bounds. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The area that is now Whately was Native American land until its purchase by English colonists from Hatfield in the late 17th century. Some farming took place then, but settlement was delayed by King Philip's War (1675-78). A land division in 1684 included provision for what is now Chestnut Plain Road, but settlement remained slow, with many early homes surrounded by wooden palisades. The archaeological remains of one such palisaded homestead remain in Whately Center. The town was separately incorporated in 1771, the date the center cemetery and its surviving animal pound were established. Only one house, the c. 1760 Morton House at 207 Chestnut Plain Road, predates the town's incorporation.

It currently houses the museum of the Swift River Historical Society. Built about 1816, it is a fine local example of Federal period architecture, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The Whitaker-Clary House is located in the village of North New Salem, on the east side of Elm Street north of United States Route 202. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, two interior chimneys, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the center entrance. The entrance has a fine Federal period surround, with flanking pilasters and a half-round transom topped by a corniced entablature. The interior follows a central hall plan, and retains many fine finishes, including woodwork finished to resemble marble. A two-story ell extends to one side. The house was built in about 1816 by William Whitaker, was a lawyer, shopkeeper, and member of the local militia during the War of 1812. This house served as his home and law office. It was purchased form the Whitakers by Mr and Mrs Edward Clary, and it remained in the Clary family until it was taken by the Massachusetts Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) because it was in the watershed of the nearby Quabbin Reservoir. It was slated for demolition, but the MDC later changed its mind, and instead gave the house to the historical society for $1 in 1961. The house now contains artifacts and memorabilia of the towns which were inundated by the creation of the reservoir.

During World War I, she was known as USAT El Occidente in service with the United States Army and as USS El Occidente (ID-3307) in service with the United States Navy. At the end of war, she reverted to her original name of SS El Occidente. Built in 1910, SS El Occidente was one of four sister ships that carried cargo and a limited number of passengers for the Morgan Line. She was acquired by the U.S. Army after the United States entered World War I in April 1917, and converted to carry horses and mules to France. In February 1918, she fought a 20-minute gun battle with two German submarines, destroying the periscope of one. In August 1918, the ship was transferred to the U.S. Navy and continued transporting animals through the end of the war. El Occidente returned to the Morgan Line in 1919 and sailed with them until June 1941, when the entire Morgan Line fleet was purchased by the United States Maritime Commission. While serving as a civilian-crewed cargo ship during World War II, El Occidente was torpedoed and sunk by German submarine U-435 on 13 April 1942.  Early career  SS El Occidente was a cargo and passenger steamship launched on 24 September 1910 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. of Newport News, Virginia (yard no. 133), and delivered to the Atlantic division of the Morgan Line on 2 December 1910. She was the newest of four sister ships; the older three being , El Mundo, and . El Occidente was , was long by abeam, and made .Crowell and Wilson, p. 315. The vessel sailed for the Morgan Line, the brand name of the Southern Pacific Steamship Company (a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Railroad), which employed her to carry cargo and a limited number of passengers between New York and New Orleans, the eastern terminus of the Southern Pacific line. In April 1913, The New York Times reported that El Occidente, loaded only with cargo, had rammed a schooner in fog off the New Jersey coast. Responding to a wireless message, the Savannah steamer City of Montgomery came alongside El Occidente to offer assistance, but was refused. The name and fate of the schooner were not reported.  World War I  After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army, needing transports to get its men and materiel to France, had a select committee of shipping executives pore over registries of American shipping. The committee selected El Occidente and thirteen other American-flagged ships that were sufficiently fast, could carry enough fuel in their bunkers for transatlantic crossings, and, most importantly, were in port or not far at sea.Sharpe, p. 359.Crowell and Wilson, pp. 313–14. After El Occidente discharged her last load of passengers and cargo, she was officially handed over to the Army on 30 May. Before any troop transportation could be undertaken, all of the ships had to be hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, four, including El Occidente, were designated to carry animals and cargo; the other ten were designated to carry human passengers. The four ships designated to carry animals had to have ramps and stalls built. All the ships had to have gun platforms installed, before each ship docked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to have the guns themselves installed.Crowell and Wilson, p. 316.The only exception was for , an American Line steamer in transatlantic service to Liverpool. Finland had already been outfitted for guns in early 1917. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.Gleaves, p. 102.

Joining the return trip were Army transport , Navy armed collier , Navy oiler , and cruiser , the flagship of Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves, the head of the Navy's Cruiser and Transport Force.Gleaves, p. 54. Sources do not reveal El Occidente's movements over the next eight months. But in April 1918, the Chicago Daily Tribune reported on an encounter El Occidente had with two German submarines that had occurred on 2 February. In a 20-minute running gun battle, Naval Armed Guardsmen aboard El Occidente exchanged fire with two U-boats, one on the port and one on the starboard. The news item reported that El Occidente's gunners had demolished the periscope of one of her attackers.

On 27 August 1918, El Occidente was transferred to the Navy and commissioned the same day with Lt. Commander E. S. Campbell, USNRF. El Occidente loaded cargo and 585 horses and mules, and sailed for France on 17 September. Five animals died or were destroyed during the voyage. Offloading her cargo at Saint-Nazaire and Verdun, El Occidente returned to the U.S. on 1 November. In port when the Armistice with Germany was signed on 11 November, El Occidente loaded of cargo and 800 animals for a second Navy voyage. Departing on 17 November for Verdun, the ship arrived there on 19 December. Returning to Baltimore for repairs and alterations which included the removal of her armament and the stalls for animal cargo, El Occidente sailed again on 15 January 1919 for Bordeaux where she unloaded cargo for the Army of Occupation and embarked 90 passengers for return to the United States. She was decommissioned at New York on 18 March 1919, and delivered to the United States Shipping Board the same day.  Interwar civilian service  Returned by the USSB in March 1919, El Occidente resumed cargo service with the Morgan Line, where she had almost 15 years of routine operation. However, in the 1930s, sailing on a New York – Galveston route, El Occidente was involved in several notable events. In July 1933, El Occidente had a fire in her No. 1 cargo hold while she was southbound out from Norfolk, Virginia. El Occidente's initial radio message reported that her crew had the blaze under control, but when that proved not to be the case, she headed in, docked at the Norfolk grain elevator, and requested assistance from local firefighters. In September 1935, El Occidente came to the aid of Morgan passenger liner , which had been driven onto French Reef by the Labor Day Hurricane. Dixie had been headed from New Orleans to New York when she grounded on the reef, located about south of Miami, Florida and off shore. El Occidente, one of 15 ships that responded to Dixie's distress calls, carried two loads of passengers and baggage from Dixie to Miami. There was no loss of life during the grounding or the rescue of Dixie's passengers. In January 1937, El Occidente issued a distress call while she was in the Gulf of Mexico. After she reported a fire while some south of the mouth of the Mississippi River, U.S. Coast Guard cutters and and German freighter Leubeck all responded to the call. Before any reached the burning vessel, El Occidente reported that she had gotten the fire under control and needed no further assistance. El Occidente headed to Galveston. The following month, El Occidente issued another distress call, this time for a broken rudder while off the Virginia Capes. Coast Guard cutter responded and towed El Occidente to Norfolk, delivering her there on 7 February.  World War II  In June 1941, the United States Maritime Commission (USMC) announced that it had requisitioned the entire Morgan Line fleet of ten ships, including El Occidente and her remaining sister ships, El Oriente and El Mundo.The fourth sister, , had been involved in a collision in 1927 and had been scrapped afterwards. See: Colton, Newport News Shipbuilding . The ships were to finish previously scheduled cargo runs and be handed over to the USMC over the following six weeks. The USMC had been charged with assembling a U.S. fleet to \\"aid the democracies\\" fighting Germany in World War II, and paid $4.7 million for all ten ships and a further $2.6 million for repairs and refits. El Occidente was handed over to the War Shipping Administration at Galveston on 7 July and assigned to United States Lines, Inc., for operation. The cargo ship was placed under Panamanian registry by U.S. Lines. Little is known of El Occidente's movements over the six months, but on 30 January 1942, she left Boston for Halifax loaded with a general cargo. Arriving at Halifax on 1 February,Helgason. she joined Convoy HX 174 and headed for Liverpool on 7 February, arriving at her destination on 21 February. Two days later, El Occidente sailed for Reykjavík, where she arrived on 1 March, just in time to depart with Convoy PQ 12 for Murmansk.Also in Convoy PQ 12 was El Coston, another former Morgan Line ship. After the convoy arrived at Murmansk on 12 March, El Occidente unloaded her cargo and took on a partial ballast load of chromium ore. She departed in Convoy QP 10 on 10 April. At 01:29 on 13 April, while at position , German submarine under the command of Siegfried Strelow fired one or two torpedoes which struck El Occidente in the engine room, nearly breaking the vessel in half. El Occidente went down stern first within two minutes, with no time to launch lifeboats. Within 30 minutes of her sinking, , one of the convoy's escorts, rescued 21 of the ship's 41-man crew; the remaining 20 crewmen died.

It is centered at the junction of Depot Street and Main Street, and includes properties lining those two streets and Old Farm Road. Most of the buildings in the area date to the second half of the 19th century, featuring architectural styles typical of the period, including Queen Anne, Second Empire, Italianate, and Colonial Revival. The village grew on land that was originally granted to colonial governor Simon Bradstreet and divided in 1682, and has remained largely agricultural since then. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The Bradstreet village is located in northeastern Hatfield, occupying an area that is mostly within the floodplain of the Connecticut River just south of the border with Whately. Main Street and Depot Street are the principal roads in the area, the former roughly paralleling the river, and the latter extending west toward North Hatfield. Between Main Street and the river lie several farm access lanes, Old Farm Road and Bashin Road among then, that are mainly lined with agricultural buildings. A large number of these are barns for the curing of tobacco, a major crop in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries. Most of the built architecture of the area dates from the late 18th to early 20th century; the major exception is a 20th-century subdivision on Cronin Hill Road. The largest number of houses date to the mid-19th century, with a number of modestly styled examples of Greek Revival architecture. There are a few houses that are Italianate, and a larger set of Colonial Revival and Craftsman/Bungalow houses.

There are two forms of EUIMID, known as Short Form (SF_EUIMID) and Long Form (LF_EUIMID). Both produce a 32-bit pseudo-UIMID (pUIMID) with 0x80 in the upper 8 bits and the least significant 24 bits of the SHA-1 hash of the entire SF_EUIMID or the entire ICCID EF (for LF_EUIMID) in the lower 24 bits. The EUIMID (and UIMID) are hardware identifiers that do not change throughout the life of the card they identify. Their most important characteristic is that they are globally unique, no two R-UIM or CSIM cards should ever be given the same number. Secondly, they can identify the issuer of the code (likely a mobile phone operator in the case of LF_EUIMID, and an R-UIM or CSIM card manufacturer in the case of SF_EUIMID). The pseudo-UIMID is not unique, but can satisfy most uses of UIMID. Where this is not possible, or not desirable, another unique identifier (such as EUIMID) should be used instead or the requirement for uniqueness should be removed.  Short Form EUIMID (SF_EUIMID)  The Short Form EUIMID is based on the 56-bit MEID and is allocated from the same numbering space by the current Global Hexadecimal Administrator (GHA), the TIA. This form requires new files within the R-UIM defined in 3GPP2 specification C.S0023-C v1.0 (or higher). This was published by the TIA as TIA-820-C. The SF_EUIMID has the unique ability to override the phone’s own MEID in signaling. This is controlled by a flag inside the R-UIM stored in bit 2 of the UsgInd (Usage Indicator) elementary file (EF). This may make it easier to provision a R-UIM that is manufactured without other unique identifiers (such as MIN or IMSI). The tradeoff is that the phone hardware cannot be easily identified. This tradeoff was removed in 2008 by the ability to specify MEID or EUIMID in OTASP signaling and in 2009 by the addition of these options to the CDMA air interface StatusRequest message. The term MEID_ME is used to distinguish the hardware identity of the phone from the MEID protocol element that may be the EUIMID.  Long Form EUIMID (LF_EUIMID)  The Long Form EUIMID is the ICCID that has been present in many generations of smart cards, including the SIM cards for GSM. This is composed of up to 18 BCD digits -- up to 72 bits. The storage allocated for the ICCID is, however, 80 bits, so it is recommended that the Luhn check digit be included plus a padding digit (0xf). Importantly, it is recommended in Version 2.0 of C.S0023-C that the pseudo-UIMID is generated from all 80 stored bits. The LF_EUIMID first became externally accessible in 2008 with OTASP specification C.S0066-0 v2.0.C.S0066-0 v2.0. Over-the-Air Service Provisioning for MEID- Equipped Mobile Stations in Spread Spectrum Systems. 3GPP2. 2008. In 2009, the CDMA air interface was also upgraded to the so-called 'Release E' which allows the transmission of all available identifiers in the StatusRequest message. If an R-UIM or CSIM with Expanded UIMID is inserted in a phone the identifier that is usually transmitted as the ESN protocol element over the radio interface is the 32-bit pseudo-UIMID.

Located on the Dead Branch of the Westfield River, the mill complex includes a wood frame mill building, along with its former mill pond, impounded by a dam across the river, and a canal that brought river water to the mill for power. Also included on the property is the site of the Damon sawmill, which was established in 1761, and the Pierce cornmill, which occupied a site north of the Bisbee mill building in 1823. The Pierce mill was moved to the site, from an earlier one that may also be on the grounds of the Bisbee mill complex. The Bisbee mill complex has an evolutionary history that begins with the establishment of the mill pond in 1823 by Elisha Bisbee. Neither the dam he built, nor an 1859 dam built to form a second mill pond, have survived. Bisbee also dug a canal to bring water to his new mill building; other canals would also have been dug for the other two mills, but traces of them have not yet been found, and their exact route is not known. The mill building on the site was used, modified, and added onto, by five generations of Bisbees, until it closed its doors in the 1960s. The property was acquired by the Chesterfield Historical Society, which has operated it since 1997 as the Bisbee Mill Museum. The main mill building started in 1823 as a single 2-1/2 story gable-ended wood frame block measuring by . This was extended eastward in the 1850s with the addition of a second block, by . The two sections were joined by their end gables, although at slightly different elevations. Both sections were originally on fieldstone foundations; these have been replaced in part with modern concrete, and in part strengthened by the addition of concrete. A third section was added to the building between 1888 and 1829. Measuring by , this section had a shed roof, and was added to the south side of the main blocks. A fourth major addition was made in 1954, when another large section was added to the north side of the building. Inside the building are the working portions of the mill. The water power it provided was delivered to the three levels of the mill by shafts, gears, and belts, and operated a number of different types of machinery. The major operations were as a gristmill, a woodworking mill, and a smithy. On the bottom level, the wheel pit, located in the original 1823 part of the building, houses a turbine wheel that dates to 1919. All levels of the mill have been adapted to showcase equipment that was used in the mill during its more than 100 year active lifetime. The mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

The Queen Anne style brick rowhouse was built in 1887 for Doctor Silas R. Cooley. The property is unusual because brick was not then a common building material for housing in the Connecticut River valley, and because the rowhouse style of construction was also rare in the area. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history Graves Street is a dead-end residential street that parallels Bridge Street (Massachusetts Route 9) off Market Street just northeast of downtown Northampton from which it is separate by a railroad right-of-way. Number 8-22 is located on the north side. It consists of a row of eight residential units constructed in rowhouse fashion out of red brick. The units are arranged in pairs that are mirror images, with windows set in segmented arch openings, projecting window bays on the ground floor, and entrances sheltered by gabled porches. Each unit has a gable peak above it, in which is a round window. At the rear, each pair of units shares a projecting service ell. The rowhouses were built about 1887, during a major period of growth in the city. It was built on the former house lot of Elisha Graves, which was platted for subdivision in 1884, creating Graves Avenue. The first documented owner of the building was Silas Cooley, who became a major landowner in the region; this was one of his early acquisitions. Its early occupants were members of the city's growing working class, and included a photographer, milk contractor, and telegraph operator.

Built in 1901, it is most historically significant as the home of President of the United States Calvin Coolidge between 1906 and 1930, the height of his political career. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 1976.  Description and history  The Calvin Coolidge House is located in a quiet residential area west of downtown Northampton, on the east side of Massasoit Street near its junction with Arlington Street. It is an architecturally undistinguished 2-1/2 story two-family wood-frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. Stylistically it is basically Colonial Revival, with projecting sections to the rear of each unit, and different porch treatments on each side. The Coolidge unit, on the left, has a gable-roofed porch supported by round columns, extending partly in front of a project polygonal bay window. The interior also has some Colonial Revival features, including a fireplace in the front parlor with flanking Doric pilasters. The house was built in 1900-01 by J.W. O'Brian, and its left side was rented in 1905 by Calvin Coolidge. The Coolidges occupied that unit until 1930. This period of occupancy coincides with Coolidge's political rise from city council to Governor of Massachusetts, then Vice President and President. In 1930, Coolidge moved to \\"The Beeches\\" at 16 Hampton Terrace in Northampton, a move he said was necessitated by the increasing number of tourists coming to this address and the attendant lack of privacy.

The area was developed primarily in response to the growth of industry to the south. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The town of Ware was established in the mid-18th century, with its town center several miles to the west. The falls of the Ware River (south of this district) were an early site of industrial activity, but did not experience significant growth until the 19th century. Large-scale development of the falls for textile production began in 1821, and including the platting of streets that make up what is now the town's commercial center. Church Street was a major road leading north from this area, and its southern end was developed with churches and single-family residences. As a result, the southern end of this district has a variety of housing which is mainly Greek Revival in character, that was built before about 1850. The upper stretch of Church Street remained largely agricultural until the 1880s, with four farmhouses surviving from that time. Ware's economic prosperity in the late 19th century prompted the construction of an array of fine Queen Anne Victorian houses, many of which include particularly well-preserved carriage houses. A number of Colonial Revival houses were added as infill construction in the early 20th century.

It is centered on the triangle formed by Bridge, Henry, and Pine Streets in northeastern Amherst, and arose because of the presence of falls on the Mill River, whose water power was harnessed for mills as early as the mid-18th century. Two houses survive from the colonial period. The village, although it was defined for many years by the (mainly wood-frame) mills, no longer has any industrial buildings, as they were demolished or destroyed by fire. Most of the houses in the district were built before 1860, the peak of the village's industrial activity. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history Cushman Village is located in northeastern Amherst, in an area where the plains of the Connecticut River to the west give way to hillier terrain. The Mill River runs roughly westward in this area to the north of the village, before turning south and eventually emptying into the Connecticut. In 1738 Nathaniel Kellogg was granted water rights to establish a grist mill on the Mill River's \\"great falls\\"; in 1746 he added a lumber mill further downstream. By the late 18th century there were at least six mills of various types operating on the river, and there were clusters of mill-related worker housing nearby. The oldest surviving house was built sometime before 1759, and now stands at 24 Leverett Road. Small textile mills were built on the river in the first half of the 19th century, but most were either destroyed by fire, or were replaced by later construction. The arrival of the railroad and the establishment of a depot (no longer extant), helped give a center to the growing village. Between about 1835 and 1930 mills established by the Cushman brothers came to dominate the local economic landscape. It was during the mid-19th century that most of the village's housing stock was built. Although not always built by the mill owners, the Cushmans owned a great deal of the local housing stock by the 1870s. Much of it was in relatively conservative architectural styles, with a large amount of Greek Revival construction persisting into the 1880s, even while modest versions of Italianate, Second Empire, and Queen Anne Victorians were also being built. The house at 131 Bridge Street is a mill owner's residence, and is one of the village's more elaborate expressions of the Greek Revival.

It was designated because of its architecture, and its connection with the locally influential Dickinson family, who (in addition to renowned poet Emily Dickinson) were a locally influential family with roots dating back to early colonial times. The old Amherst depot The Emily Dickinson House, built in 1813, is the oldest house within the district, with prominence beyond its association with the poet. Her grandfather Samuel, who built the house, was a founder of Amherst College, and a prominent local politician, as was her father Edward. Her brother William Austin Dickinson was also active in the political and economic life of Amherst, helping found its water and gas companies. Leonard Hills, who lived in two separate houses in the district, ran a distinctive business that manufactured hats out of palm leaves, and was a key figure in the founding of Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts at Amherst). The district also includes Amherst's Gothic First Congregational Church (1867), and the brick Italianate Central Vermont Railroad depot (1853), one of the oldest surviving railroad stations in the state.

Built in 1840 and remodeled in 1870, it exhibits a well-preserved combination of Greek Revival and Second Empire features. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and was included as a contributing property to the East Village Historic District in 1986.  Description and history  The Conkey-Stevens House is located on the west side of Amherst's East Village, on the north side of Main Street opposite its junction with Shumway Street. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a mansard roof providing a full third story in the attic level. It has a three- bay front facade, with a single-story porch wrapping across the front and around the right side. The main roof cornice has modillion blocks, with paired brackets set between the window bays. The steep slope of the mansard roof is pierced by three dormers, the outer ones with triangular pediments and the middle one with a segmented-arch pediment. The ground-floor front windows are full length in the Greek Revival style, with the main entrance in the right bay. This distinctive brick house was built in 1840 with Greek Revival features, but was remodeled in 1870 with a Second Empire style mansard roof. Ithmar Conkey, for whom it was built, was a prominent local lawyer and businessman, who was also active in regional civic affairs. In 1868 it was acquired by Abiel Stevens, whose wife was the sister-in-law of Sidney Dillon, an executive of the Union Pacific Railroad. Their son Albert worked for the railroad, and used his earnings to refashion the house in the Second Empire style. The house remained in the Stevens family until 1977.

Five of them have side gable roofs and are five bays wide; the Theodore Bartlett House is a Greek Revival house with a front-facing gable and a three- bay front facade. Three of the houses are basically Georgian colonial in character, the Roger Clapp House being the oldest of these (built c. 1753). Two are Greek Revival, and one, the Eleazer Strong House (built 1797), is one of the city's oldest Federal style houses. In addition to their age and architectural significance, all six buildings are notable for their association with the families of some of its earliest settlers. Preserved Clapp was one of Northampton's first settlers, and it was his son Roger who built the Clapp House that now stands. The two Strong houses were built by sons of Elder John Strong, another prominent early arrival, and the two Bartlett houses were built by descendants of Robert Bartlett, a town selectman between 1657 and 1663.

It encompasses a landscape that has seen agricultural use since 17th century colonial days, including fields now used for tobacco farming, and historic properties located along five roads: Elm Street, Scotland Road, Sunset Road, Brook Hollow Road, and Little Neponset Road. The district is bounded on its south by the Connecticut River, on its east and north by the Mill River, with a small portion of land border in the northeast which cuts off a large meander in the river. This section, near the junction of Elm and Prospect Streets, is also where this district abuts the Mill- Prospect Street Historic District, which runs north along Prospect Street, and its eastern boundary abuts the Hatfield Center Historic District. Its western boundary is roughly a north-south line in the area of the junction of Elm and Dwight Streets. Most of the buildings in the district are either residential or agricultural in nature, and the district includes the agricultural fields lying south of Elm Street, as well as important agricultural buildings such as tobacco drying barns. The houses in the district stylistically represent the long history of the period, and most home construction in the area had ended by the 1940s. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Hatfield was settled in the mid-17th century, and was incorporated as a town in 1670. The Elm Street area was originally common agricultural land, with land along Elm Street formally platted for residential development in 1683. Growth was generally slow, with a significant uptick in new construction after American independence in the late 19th century. Unlike the more prosperous town center, the Elm Street area saw the construction of utilitarian agricultural worker housing. It also saw the growth of some small cottage industries, such as broom-making which were also found in other parts of the town. Tobacco was a major and highly successful crop in the area, resulting in the construction of many tobacco barns. A trolley line built in 1900 on Elm Street to Northampton spurred additional development in the early 20th century.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history Amherst was settled in the early 18th century and incorporated out of Hadley in 1759. Its first meeting house was built near what is now Amherst Center, but a second parish was established at East Village in 1783. East Village benefited economically from industry on the Fort River, just to the east of the village center, and flourished in the first half of the 19th century, with a number of cottage industries operating in it or nearby. Amherst Center benefited from the founding of Amherst College in 1821, and by the arrival of the railroad in 1853, which led to its subsequent economic dominance. Growth slowed significantly, with only a few residential buildings and a new school added in the later decades of the 19th century. The district is a roughly cruciform shape, centered at the junction of Main and East Streets, from which a narrow strip-like green extends southward. It includes 49 buildings, including some of Amherst's oldest surviving structures. Four buildings, three houses and a tavern, date to the 18th century, while there are more numerous examples of Greek Revival and Federal architecture from the first half of the 19th century.

A single-story ell extends to the right of this section, with an open porch across its front. The house was built in 1849 for Basil Dorsey, an African American who escaped slavery in 1836 with abolitionist help. The lot on which it was built was purchased from the Bensonville Manufacturing Company, the silkmaking business of abolitionist George Benson. The Dorsey family lived in the house until 1852, when it moved to another Florence house. This house was purchased in 1854 by Mary Jones, the wife of Thomas H. Jones, another escaped slave and antislavery activist. An itinerant preacher, Jones was rarely present, and the family moved from Florence to Worcester in 1859.

It also has the community's highest concentration of high-quality 18th-century residential architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The area that is now South Hadley was originally common land held by the citizens of Hadley. This status ended with a division of land among the taxpayers in 1720, with settlement following soon afterward. Woodbridge Street was then the principal road between Hadley and Amherst, and was where a number of new homes were erected in the following years. One of the district's oldest surviving structures, now the rear ell of 82 Woodbridge Street, was built by Joseph White in 1727. The area remained agricultural into the 20th century, and benefited from the early preservation efforts of philanthropist Joseph Allan Skinner, who funded the restoration of a number of its houses in the early 20th century.

It was built in 1885 to a design by the architectural firm of Hartwell and Richardson, and is a prominent local example of Romanesque Revival architecture. The building, enlarged in 1904 and 1935 with stylistically sensitive additions, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history Ware Town Hall is located in the town center, at the southeast corner of Main (Massachusetts Route 9) Street and West Street. it is a roughly square shape, built out of red brick trimmed with red sandstone, with a tall hip roof and tower on one flank. The tower is square, rising to a pyramidal roof. At the center of the Main Street facade is a large round-arch opening, in which the main entrance is recessed. A secondary entrance is found on the lower level of the west side, facing West Street, under a projecting gabled canopy. Windows on the side are set in round-arch openings. The main floor of the building houses an auditorium and theater facilities, and the town offices are located in the basement. In the town's early days, its town meetings were held in the meeting house located at Ware Center, the town's geographic and early civic center. The present center arose around a manufacturing village that grew in the early 19th century. The first town hall was built in 1847, and burned in 1860. Until construction of this building was completed in 1886, town meetings were held in the Music Hall on Bank Street. This building was designed by Hartwell & Richardson, a Boston firm noted for its designs carrying the Richardsonian Romanesque influence. That firm also designed a 1904 enlargement, necessitated in part of state fire regulations concerning the number of exits in performance venues (which the main auditorium was used for). It was again enlarged in 1935, in another stylistically sensitive design by local architect Thomas Madigan.

It is a chick-lit novel by Sophie Kinsella, a pseudonym of Madeline Wickham. It follows the story of Becky Brandon (née Bloomwood) and her husband Luke as they navigate Becky's first pregnancy. Plot The plot jumps several months forward from Shopaholic and Sister. Becky is now heavily pregnant with her first child and is preparing for the arrival of her newborn. During a sonogram appointment with Luke, Becky is briefly left unaccompanied in the ultrasound room. Desperate to know the gender of the baby despite Luke's wishes to the contrary, Becky takes the ultrasound equipment to find out for herself. She initially thinks she can see male genitals on the baby but the sonographer returns, catching Becky and explains what Becky is actually examining is her own bladder. Back at the apartment, it's revealed that Becky and Luke have recently sold up in order to buy a house. The couple have difficulty finding a place which meets Becky's approval. Becky's relationship with Jess has drastically improved since the last novel as is evident when Jess arrives. Jess continues in her endeavor to make Becky more environmentally friendly, encouraging her to use second hand baby items, the mere prospect of which Becky finds horrifying. Becky's friendship with Suze has also improved despite Suze's involvement with Lulu, a mother introduced in the last novel whom Becky doesn't get along with. The two still have the occasional insult run-ins due to their obvious dislike for each other. Once again, Becky and Luke's marriage has been strained due to increasing anxiety on Luke's part over a new business partnership with the Arcodas group. While shopping at a luxury baby boutique, Bambino, Becky overhears a conversation about a celebrity obstetrician, Venetia Carter. Becky - fantasizing over the idea of a luxurious birthing experience - rushes home to consult Luke. Much to Becky's disdain Luke is firm and insists Becky remain a patient of Dr. Braine (an older obstetrician who has seen many of the Brandon women through their pregnancies, and whom Becky doesn't like and finds dull). After much nagging from Becky an exasperated Luke admits defeat and the couple attend an appointment with Venetia. Becky is taken aback when Venetia treats her with little interest whilst being flirtatious with Luke. She is further upset when it's revealed Venetia and Luke used to date during their time together in college, but she consoles herself with the knowledge Venetia is in a relationship. At a later appointment Becky is distraught to learn that Venetia is newly single, her married boyfriend having returned to his wife. This sets alarm bells ringing for Becky. As the novel progresses, Becky grows more and more suspicious of the relationship between Luke and Venetia; even going as far as to hire a private detective. As the baby's impending birth draws ever closer, Venetia and Becky have a dispute during an obstetric appointment, wherein Venetia spitefully confesses that she believes Becky and Luke should never have married and that she has every intention to pursue Luke once the baby is born. Once Becky has recovered from the shock of this revelation she plans to out Venetia's plans to Luke, hoping he'll be similarly horrified. Becky arrives at the party Venetia and Luke are attending only to find the two dancing together. The stress of witnessing this causes her to pass out. When Becky comes around, Luke is apologetic but denies any romantic involvement with Venetia. He admits the truth to Becky about his previous relationship with Venetia and she regrets making him switch obstetricians. The couple decide it's in their best interests to return to Dr. Braine and for a brief while, and everything seems to be going smoothly. Then while Luke is out, Becky receives photos from the PI that she hired named, Jim, and discovers Venetia along with Lulu in the company of Iain Walker, the CEO of the Arcodas Group. Although he claims Luke hasn't changed, Becky isn't fooled and points him out from behind Iain. Jim gets angry and yells at his son for screwing up. His son defends himself by admitting he had been following Iain and Venetia around in secret due to possible suspicion on them trying to ruin Brandon Communications' reputation by running it out of business. Overhearing this, Becky finally realizes Venetia's involvement with Iain. As she thinks about it more, Becky realizes how much she is motivated in destroying Luke' company and reputation in order to force him to leave her. She convinces Jim to apologize to his son as she now knows what's going on and she must save Brandon C.'s reputation. When she shows Luke the photos of Iain and Venetia together, he demands Becky to tell him where she got them. She refuses to elaborate and feels guilty for suspecting Luke of having an affair with Venetia. During her baby shower, Becky shows Suze photos she procured from her private investigator of Lulu in an unflattering light. Looking through the photos, Suze sees the truth of her hypocrisy in being unable to control her wild children and also her affair with Iain. Finally realizing how much of a hypocrite she is and despite Becky encouraging her to expose the latter to the Daily World, Suze decides she will end her friendship with her. Becky unwittingly comes across a love note sent by Venetia amongst gifts for the baby. Sneaking away from her own party, she goes to the birthing center in order to confront Venetia, pretending to be in early labor. Family and friends arrive at the clinic anticipating the baby's birth and when Venetia comes into the birthing room, Becky tells everyone present about the obstetrician's scheme. Luke, in disbelief, demands an explanation and becomes increasingly enraged as Venetia talks and including her affair with Iain in order to destroy Brandon C's reputation. As an argument begins, Suze confronts him for not telling everyone else the truth and only telling Becky about his past. Luke finally reveals to everyone present that Venetia has always been troublesome and even once feigning a pregnancy in order to keep him in a relationship he disapproved of. He didn't regret breaking up with her because of the trouble she caused him over the years. Enraged, Venetia tries one last effort to make him take her back and leave Becky by rudely calling her a dumb little airhead who doesn't deserve him. Luke refuses and tells Venetia off that he loves his wife regardless. Unlike Venetia who he sees as manipulative and conniving, Becky is a caring and intuitive person who puts others before herself. Whilst revelations are coming out into the open, Becky takes this opportunity to explain that she and Luke are effectively homeless as the home they had planned to purchase has been bought from under them in the midst of all the trouble Venetia has caused. To console Becky, Suze offers her and Luke her family's unused summer home in Scotland. However, Becky's mother, Jane, insists that they stay with her and Graham in Surrey. During the dispute, Becky's water breaks and she is calm about it. While everyone else admires Becky's calmness during her water breaking, a furious Jane reprimands Venetia for her behavior stating that she caused too much trouble in her family's life and orders her out of the room. Dr. Braine is called by another family member in order to assist during the birth. After Venetia leaves, Suze is disgusted by this and announces her intent to write an exposé about Venetia in the British tabloid magazine, \\"The Daily World\\", to help other pregnant women to avoid her. Dr. Braine arrives and helps Paula, an assistant working for Venetia in the delivery of Luke and Becky's child into the world, a daughter they name Minnie. Relieved, Becky and Luke are given some privacy in welcoming Minnie. The book ends with Luke, Becky and Minnie living modestly in the Bloomwood family home.

It is roughly bounded by South Street, the Ware River, Upper Dam Complex, Park Street, Otis Avenue and Church Street. The area includes surviving mill buildings, the oldest of which date to the 1840s, and a collection of tenement-style housing built for the millworkers, built between 1845 and the 1880s. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The Ware Millyard area first saw industrial use in the 18th century, when Jabez Olmsted established a sawmill at the falls of the Ware River. Capitalizing on the innovations in textile manufacturing that led to the establishment of Lowell, Massachusetts, investors in 1821 purchased mill privileges at the falls, and incorporated the Ware Manufacturing Company in 1823. The company platted out the area, with the mills along the river, and a dam and holding pond upriver. Housing for workers was planned for a street grid lying roughly north of the mill complex. Elements of this plan are still visible in the architecture of the mill complex, street plan, and the residential buildings on the streets. Although elements of the water power infrastructure date to this period, only one building, the company office, survives from this period. All of the major mill buildings date to later in the 19th century. The mill was the region's largest employer for nearly a century.

Centered at the junction of Massachusetts Route 9 with Greenwich Plains Road, it is a linear district extending about along Route 9 in either direction. Most of the structures in the district were built between 1760 and 1860, although there are some 20th century intrusions. The area was the center of town civic and commercial activity until the 1820s, when villages serving industry became more important. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history Ware was settled in the 1717 and incorporated in 1775. Its town center was laid out in 1760, on land belonging to one of its early large landowners. The first colonial meeting house was built in that year, near the geographic center of the town, and the road network developed around access to this area from the corners of the town. It had services typical of a town center, including a tavern and blacksmithy, but other industrial activity was modest, and was eclipsed in the 19th century by the industrialization of Factory Village, where the modern town center is located. The village retained much of its early Georgian and Federal character in part because the economic focus in the town moved with the advent of industrialization elsewhere in the town during the 19th century. The district is basically linear, with the First Congregational Church near its center. That church was built in 1799, near the site of the 1760 meeting house. The only other non-residential building in the district is a former district school built in 1872. The oldest building in the district is a farmhouse located at the corner of Walker and Doane RD, 42 Doane rd, this expansive single-family house was built in 1732. There is a building in the district, built in 1759 known as the Ezra Thayer House, a well- preserved Georgian house that was built for the town's first settled minister. It is one of four houses in the village built for ministers. There is one house, built about 1780 and subsequently enlarged, that served as a tavern for many years.

The home was designed for William Palmer, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, and his wife Mary. It sits on three lots at the end of a quiet, dirt road cul-de-sac. The location is near the Nichols Arboretum, and less than a mile (1.2 km) from the university. History William Palmer was born in Imlay City, Michigan, and studied economics at the University of Michigan; in 1930 he became a professor at the school. Mary Warton Shuford was born in North Carolina and enrolled in the University of Michigan's School of Music in 1935. She graduated in 1937 and married William Palmer. The couple purchased this property in 1949 and began seeking an architect to build their home. After seeing the Affleck house in Bloomfield Hills, they contacted Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright designed the house in 1950. The house was continuously owned by the Palmer family from 1951 to 2009. It was placed on the market in early August 2008, with restrictions in place. Jeffrey and Kathryn Schox purchased the house in March 2009. Jeffrey Schox, who is a San Francisco patent attorney, spends several weeks a year in Ann Arbor. When he is not in Ann Arbor, the Palmer House will be available for rent as a guest house and as a meeting location. Description The Palmer house is a 2,000 square-foot Usonian home. It is located in a hillside and constructed of red cypress and brick. The house has a triangular geometry, with no right angles in the structure. There is a central entryway with three wings extend off from that: a bedroom wing to on side, a living room and terrace wing to the other, and a smaller carport perpendicularly. The hipped roof is long and dramatic, with a low slope and wide overhangs extending over each wings; it is clad with cedar shingles and copper. A small garden house to the rear contains a collection of Wright-designed furniture. References * Storrer, William Allin. The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion.

The village is centered on the junction of Huntington Road (Massachusetts Route 112), Ireland Street, and Thrasher Hill Road. The district extends along Ireland Road as far as Conwell Road, and one contributing element, the dam which impounds Little Galilee Pond, extends into neighboring Chesterfield. The area had a number of small mills along the banks of the Little River, a tributary of the Westfield River, but only one complex, the Theron Higgins Mill on South Worthington Road, has survived from the 19th century. Most of the buildings in the district are residences dating to the 19th century; also included are three churches, including the particularly elegant Greek Revival South Worthington Methodist Church (1848). The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The South Worthington area first developed as a modest agricultural area in the 1760s. A falls in the Little River proved a good location for a sawmill, which was standing by 1794, and followed by a grist mill in 1812. The village flourished as a service center for the local farmers, and additional mills survived for a time in the 19th century, one of which was used to manufacture window blinds. The first church was built in 1828; the building, which still stands, was later used as a general store and as a school, after the present Greek Revival church was built. The village also achieved some notice as the birthplace and summer home of Russell Conwell (1843-1925), a famous Baptist minister and writer who founded Temple University. Conwell's summer stays in the house of his youth brought visitors to the community. Conwell's association with the village is commemorated by boulder with a plaque mounted on it near that house, 42 Conwell Road.

Located facing Burton Lawn, it was built in 1890 as a fine addition to the adjacent Gothic style buildings. The building now houses the college's archives, and was connected by the adjacent Neilson Library by a bridge in 1982. It is the first place in which a formal women's basketball game was played, in 1892, and is one of the first American athletic facilities built specifically for women. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The former Smith Alumnae Gymnasium is located in the central part of the Smith College Campus, immediately south of Neilson Library and north of Green Street. It faces the college's Burton Lawn, along with other buildings of the campus that were designed by Peabody & Stearns. It is built out of red brick with brownstone trim, with Late Gothic style that complements the surrounding buildings. Its main roofline is steeply pitched and hipped, with a small square cupola with flared roof at the center. From the main roof, a series of gabled and hip-roofed sections project, as do several smaller hip- roofed dormers. Most windows are rectangulas sash, but there are round-arch windows which illuminate the projecting stairwells. The gymnasium was built in 1890 to a design by William C. Brocklesby of Hartford, Connecticut. It replaced an older wood-frame structure that was part of the original Peabody & Stearns plan for the campus, and was built in 1879. Brocklesby is credited with the design of nine buildings on the Smith campus. It was here that Senda Berenson, the college's directory of physical education, adapted the then-new game of basketball for women, and where the first formal women's basketball game was played. In the 1970s, the school first planned to demolish the building as part of a planned expansion of Neilson Library. This was protested by the campus community, and was eventually replaced by a proposal to move the building to make way for the expansion. In 1982, the building underwent renovation, and was connected to the library via a bridge.

The Spanish Colonial Revival building on the campus (construction begun in 1925) is the only structure of its type in the city, was the first monastery established in western Massachusetts. It was enlarged in 1955, and served as a Roman Catholic monastery, retreat, and outreach center until 1993. It has since been converted into a senior living facility, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The former Our Mother of Sorrows Monastery and Retreat Center is located in a residential area north of downtown West Springfield, on more than of landscaped grounds on the north side of Monastery Street. The main building is a large five-section masonry structure with Spanish Colonial Revival styling. It has a steel frame, and its exterior is finished in brick and ashlar granite. First-floor window and door openings generally have rounded arches, while upper-floor windows are sash set in rectangular openings. It is covered by a red tile hip roof. Three of the five wings have more elaborate styling; these are the oldest section of the building, while the left wings, which give the building a general C shape, were added in 1955. The Passionist Order is a Roman Catholic fraternity founded in 1720 in what is now Italy. By the early 19th century, it had spread to English-speaking countries, and by 1852 it had reached the United States. The Catholic population of Massachusetts, small in the early 19th century, grew substantially due to immigration from Ireland and Quebec. The first Passionist monastery was established in Boston, and in 1922 members of the order proposed establishing one in western Massachusetts. This property was built in 1923 to a design by John T. Comes of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who had designed a retreat for the Passionists there. The building is the largest example of Spanish colonial architecture in the region. The monastery performed three principal functions during its period of operation (1923-1993). It provided a place for the contemplative life of order members, who followed rigidly prescribed patterns of life focused on work and prayer. It provided a retreat space for priests engaged in outreach throughout the region, and as a training ground for future priests and monks. In its later years it expanded to offer weekend retreats to lay people as well. The monastery operated as a nearly self-sufficient entity, raising most of its own food on garden plots on the grounds, and also housed a small infirmary where sick members not requiring hospitalization could be treated. The popularity of its retreat offerings declined in the second half of the 20th century, and the monastery population also began to shrink and age. In 1990, the facility opened its doors as an elder housing facility operated by the order, but was then shut down in 1993, its religious functions dispersed to other locations. The building subsequently underwent a certified historic rehabilitation, and now functions as an assisted living facility.
