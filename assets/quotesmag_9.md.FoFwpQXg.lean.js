Its oldest portion dating to about 1677, it is a well- preserved example of First Period architecture, modified by repeated addition during the 18th century. The house has belonged to the Rowley Historical Society since the 1920s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Platts-Bradstreet House is set on the southeast side of Main Street Massachusetts Route 1A opposite its junction with Pleasant Street in the village center of Rowley. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a two-story rear ell, wooden clapboard siding, and a large central chimney. The front facade, facing the street, is an asymmetrical five bays, with the entrance in the center bay and sash windows elsewhere. The entrance is set in a simple frame with an overhanging cornice. In addition to the house, the property includes a barn, a small shoe shop, and a long rectangular structure with a pitched roof. The oldest portion of the house, a full-width two-story structure with a depth of one room, was probably built in 1677 by Samuel Platts (1617-1682), who purchased the land in 1660 and was charged with tax on a house in that year. Early in the 18th century this structure was enlarged by adding a lean-to section, which would have given the house a classic New England saltbox appearance. In the late 1760s Moses Bradstreet (d. 1786) raised the lean-to section to a full two stories, giving the main block its present form. The interior styling of the house also appears to date to this time period. Because of the property's long history of use, it is believed to have historical archaeological artifacts relative to the domestic history of its occupants. The property has been owned by the Rowley Historical Society since the 1920s.

Architecture The dwelling, designed by Philadelphia socialite J. S. Lovering Wharton and artist William Trost Richards, is a three-story 23-room 10,000-square-foot shingle-style cottage. The structural system of heavy mill-type framing was designed to withstand hurricane-force winds. The name \\"Clingstone\\" was suggested by a remark that it was \\"a peach of a house\\". In August 2010 the interior was documented in a series of panoramic photographs. Film director Wes Anderson modeled the house from Moonrise Kingdom after Clingstone, specifically the interior shingles. Owners The original owner, a nephew of industrialist Joseph Wharton, built the house in response to the government condemning his earlier summer home in order to build Fort Wetherill. Wharton summered there until his death in 1931. Although little damaged by a hurricane in 1938, the residence was still vacant at the time of his wife's death in 1957 until it was purchased in 1961 by Boston architect Henry Wood. Wood, a distant cousin of the Philadelphia Whartons, was able to purchase the property for $3,600, the amount owed in back taxes. The house is known by locals as \\"The House on a Rock\\".

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. The building has a complicated history, in part because it includes parts of two different structures. A house was built c. 1690 in downtown Ipswich, and moved near the Choat Bridge in 1735. This house, known as the Ross Tavern, remained at that site until it was disassembled and moved to Jeffrey's Neck by Daniel Wendell, an amateur architectural historian, in 1940. Nothing is known of its original owners. Wendell joined the tavern to a second house, the c. 1675‚Äì1700 Lord-Collins House, that he also moved to the site.

A small battery powered Luminglas device, turned off. A crackle tube is a type of plasma lamp that is used most commonly in museums, night clubs, movie sets, and other applications where its appearance may be appealing for entertainment. Such a device consists of a double walled glass tube with a hollow center. The cavity between the inner and outer glass tubes is filled with thousands of small phosphor coated glass beads. A 5‚Äì14 kV transformer produces a low power gas discharge in the bead filled cavity, producing filaments of light that simulate lightning. Crackle tubes get their name not because of the sound they produce but rather because of the appearance of their internal behavior. The \\"lightning\\" (filaments or streamers) is forced around and in between the phosphor-coated glass beads, due to the beads' dielectric nature. In so doing, the phosphor is excited by the electrical energy and fluoresces producing visible light. Like plasma globes, crackle tubes respond to touch; the filaments appear to be \\"attracted\\" toward the point of contact and usually become more luminous (brighter) as the electricity is grounded. The tubes are also filled with a noble gas like neon, argon, or xenon which acts as the electron transfer medium of the cavity. The gas is typically below atmospheric pressure. Borg on display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum Typically, crackle tubes are cylindrical, however, they can be made into virtually any shape, even flat plates (trademarked by the name \\"Luminglas\\" ). The filaments can also be made to any color by combining different chemicals with the base phosphor. The chemical that is used to produce blue filaments is also responsive to ultraviolet light. The filaments can change color as they progress along the length of the tube. This effect is created by using glass beads with different chemical coatings on them, and the color of the filament changes as the electrical discharge transitions from one color layer to another. Chemical coatings can also be combined onto a single coating, allowing for a crackle tube to have multiple simultaneous filaments of several different colors. Crackle tubes appear white when viewed in their off state under normal lighting conditions. Their luminosity, or light intensity, depends on several factors, but generally crackle tubes are not very bright when compared to a fluorescent light or incandescent lamp. They are best viewed in darkness. Their transformers can also be linked to an acoustic modulator, allowing the tubes to 'respond' to music or ambient noise.

The Common was established in 1667, and during this period it was partially a swamp. Until 1802, there was no enclosing fence, allowing livestock to freely roam across it. In 1802 a subscription was put forth to beautify the park. The current wrought iron fence around the Common was built in 1850 and has undergone restoration. The white archway that stands near the north entrance was originally a design by Samuel McIntire, but it had to be removed because of its condition. The current archway is a replica of the original that was made in 1976. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 12, 1976, and further expanded on June 27, 2002. The district boundaries include the Essex Institute Historic District, a cluster of buildings along Essex and Brown streets owned by the Peabody Essex Museum.

Captain John Bertram purchased the Federal mansion from John Forrester and later sold it to Col. George Peabody. Col. George Peabody lived in the mansion for about 60 years and while there he made the mansion larger by the addition of a one-story dining room.

Salem as the Birthplace of the National Guard Map of Salem, Massachusetts in 1820. In 1637, the first muster on Salem Common took place where for the first time, a regiment of militia (the East Regiment) drilled for the common defense of a multi-community area, thus laying the foundation for what became the Army National Guard. In 1714 Salem decided that forever in front of Nathaniel Higginson's House on the Common there shall be a training Field for the militia.

It was built in 1875 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Construction Saugus Center and Town Hall In 1874, construction began on Saugus' second and present town hall. The cornerstone was laid on October 17, 1874. The day's exercises began with a procession from Sutton Hall up Chestnut Street, through Winter and Central Streets, up Main Street, through Summer Street, down Pleasant Street, and down Central Street to the site of the Town Hall. The Rev. Mr. Allen delivered an invocation and then the stone was laid by members of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. The East Saugus Brass Band provided music. Harmon Hall then made the introductory remarks. Nathaniel P. Banks followed with an oration. Wilbur F. Newhall made the closing remarks. The exercises ended with a benediction by Rev. F. V. Tenney. Saugus Town Hall was built on a low, wet piece of land purchased from Samuel A. Parker. The land was filled at great expense and construction of the town hall put Saugus in a $50,000 debt. This was one of the reasons that the neighborhood of East Saugus sought to be set off from Saugus and annexed to the city of Lynn. East Saugus was unable to get a bill in both houses of the state legislature, and the issue was dropped after the town appropriated $5,000 for the laying of water pipes through East Saugus. The building was officially dedicated on March 1, 1877. It was attended by residents from Saugus as well as from surrounding communities. Seated on the stage were dignitaries from Saugus and Lynn, including the Saugus Board of Selectmen, Lynn mayor Samuel M. Bubier, and former Lynn mayors James N. Buffum and Hiram N. Breed. The dedicatory address was given by Wendell Phillips. Mayor Buffum then made a speech and was followed by Building Committee Chairman E. P. Robinson, who made a brief speech followed by a formal handing over of the building's keys to Board of Selectmen Chairman E. W. Newhall, who also spoke. The hymn Old 100th was then sung and Rev. Samuel Jackson ended the ceremony with a benediction. Layout The first floor originally housed the selectmen, town clerk, and town treasurer's offices, as well as the school committee room, a high school classroom, and the public library. The high school and library have since moved to their own buildings and the school committee room is now located in the School Administration Building. The second story originally served as a community room that hosted a number of events including town meetings, political rallies, high school graduations, plays, boxing matches, puppet shows, firemen's balls, banquets, and school dances. It was later divided into offices for the accounting, financing, public works and personnel/purchasing departments. When the Town Hall was renovated in 1997, the second floor once again became an assembly room. The basement housed the town's police department and jail until a police station was constructed in 1936. Notable events Saugus Town Hall front view On March 14, 1892, town collector William F. Hitchings died during the Annual Town Meeting. He was distributing copies of a circular addressing an inaccuracy he had made when he suddenly died. In 1922, Private Winslow Hodgson laid in state after his body returned from burial in France. The local American Legion post wanted to hold the lying in state on a date the conflicted with a dance held by the Saugus Canoe and Tennis Club. The club chose not to postpone its dance, citing short notice and the great expense that had gone into the event. Members of the Legion stood outside of the dance with a banner that read \\"Enjoy Yourselves Dancing While The Body Of A Dead Soldier Lies In The Morgue\\". On October 31, 1927, a fire in the basement of the town hall caused $5000 in damages. The fire started in the cell room of the police headquarters and ate through the floors and partitions of the building. Police officers and firemen were able to save the town's irreplaceable documents, books, and articles. In 1929, Marchioness Townshend, mayor of King's Lynn, visited Saugus Town Hall on her visit to the town. The Marchioness, who was visiting the area as part of Lynn, Massachusetts' tercentenary celebration, also visited the Boardman House and the Saugus Iron Works while in Saugus. From August 26 to August 28, 1932, the body of John Burke, a soldier killed in Tientsin, China laid in state at the town hall. From December 8 to 11, 1947, the body of Staff Sergeant Arthur F. DeFranzo laid in state at the town hall. DeFranzo was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. In 1975, $30,000 in municipal funds (about $19,000 in cash and $11,000 in checks) were stolen from a vault the Collector‚ÄìTreasurer's office. The theft occurred two weeks after a set of keys was taken from a custodian who had left them in a ladies room door. Town Manager Maurice Cunningham could not explain why the money had not been deposited in a local bank as it usually was. Renovation In 1976, the building underwent renovation. The rear portion of the building was reconditioned and aluminium siding was installed. In 1977, the building was painted and the broken slate tiles on the roof were replaced. By the 1990s the town hall had fallen into disrepair and the town proposed tearing it down. However, the Saugus Historical Commission pushed to save and restore the building. The town's Capital Improvement Plan included funding for its renovation. In 1998, The Friends of Town Hall was formed to raise money to complete several projects not covered by the plan. This included the purchase of a piano for functions in the town hall auditorium, installation of display cases exhibiting historic items on the first floor, and the dedication of \\"The Founding of Saugus Mural\\" in the Town Hall auditorium. The town hall was closed during the renovations and the offices were moved to the former high school extension building on Main Street. A reopening ceremony was held on November 17, 1998. Board of Selectmen chairman Janette Fasano served as the master of ceremonies and delivered the opening and closing remarks. Father John Mulloy delivered the invocation. Town Manager Steven Angelo, former town manager Richard Cardillo, Secretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin, Historical Commission chairman Stephen Carlson, United States Representative John F. Tierney, Massachusetts Senate President Tom Birmingham, and State Senator Edward J. Clancy, Jr. spoke. Selectmen Richard Barry, Jon Bernard, Chris Ciampa, and Anthony Cogliano also made remarks. Reverend Gregg Messerole delivered the benediction. In total, the renovations cost $3.5 million.

Description and history The Sewall-Scripture House is set at the northeast corner of King and Granite Streets (the latter designated Massachusetts Route 127), on the outskirts of Rockport's main village. It is a 2-1/2 story structure with a side-gable roof, whose main block is constructed out of locally quarried granite. The front and side walls are formed out of dressed blocks about in size; the rear wall is formed out of coursed random and square rubblestone. A 2-1/2 story wood-frame ell, apparently original to the house's construction, extends to the rear; it is finished in wooden clapboards. The main facade is five bays wide, with a central entry set in a round-arch opening with flanking sidelight windows. The house was built in 1832 by Levi Sewall, owner of a granite quarry located on Pigeon Cove. Stone for this house was hauled from the quarry by teams of oxen. Sewall was one of Rockport's leading quarry owners, his business operating independently until its merger in 1921 with the Rockport Granite Company.

Shawsheen Village was completed in the early 1920s as a planned corporate community. Conceived by William Madison Wood of the American Woolen Company, the village was designed a team of architects including Adden & Parker, Clifford Allbright, Ripley and LeBoutillier and James E. Allen. John Franklin, a civil engineer for the American Woolen Company was responsible for designing the village, under the direction of Wood. Buildings from the original Frye Village were also incorporated into the design which included a railroad station, shops, apartment buildings, factories, parks and numerous single-family dwellings.From a plaque in Wood Memorial Park. The village was located just up the road from the Company's main factories in nearby Lawrence. The village was roughly divided into three sections. The westernmost of these sections, around the junction of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 28) with Massachusetts Route 133 (Lowell Street to the west, Haverhill Street to the east), was the village center, with shops, a post office. Immediately east of this area, descending to the Shawsheen River, was the industrial area. One residential area was primarily north and west of this central area, and it provided housing for the upper level executives of the Company. The third area was east and south of the industrial area, spilling across the railroad tracks and river, where middle class worker housing was provided. Sprinkled throughout were old houses from the Frye Village settlement that were relocated according to Wood's vision. Although the company community was well conceived, it was short-lived.

An enormous wading bird rookery can be found in the swamps of the refuge from May until July, while tens of thousands of waterfowl winter in its marshes. The brown pelican is a year- round resident of southeast Louisiana. The number of nesting brown pelicans has substantially increased despite loss of nesting habitat. Brown pelicans are frequent users of the refuge. Several bald eagles, another threatened species, visit the refuge each year. Other wildlife include waterfowl, wading birds, shorebirds, marsh rabbits, white pelicans, alligators, and other raptors, game and small mammals, reptiles and amphibians Habitat The refuge contains a variety of different habitats, including freshwater and brackish marshes, bottomland hardwood forests, lagoons, canals, borrow pits, chenieres (former beach fronts) and natural bayous. The marshes along Lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne serve as estuarine nurseries for various fish species, crabs and shrimp. Freshwater lagoons, bayous and ponds serve as production areas for largemouth bass, crappie, bluegill and catfish. The diverse habitats meet the needs of 340 bird species during various seasons of the year. Peak waterfowl populations of 75,000 use the wetland areas during the fall, winter, and early spring months.

The town's South Green was laid out in 1686, and is now the heart of a collection of historic properties dating from the 17th to the 19th century. The centerpiece of the district is the green itself, and its most notable associated property is the John Whipple House, a National Historic Landmark and museum. The district boundaries extend from the junction of South Main and Elm Streets, southward past the green to where County Road (Massachusetts Route 1A) crosses Saltonstall's Creek. Ipswich voted to establish the South Green in 1686, after which it was used as a common grazing area, and as a training ground for the local militia. It was also the site of Ipswich's earliest school buildings, which even predated the establishment of the green as a common area. The first schoolhouse was built in the area in 1652; it was moved to the Meetinghouse Green in 1704, at which time private education continued in the area. A public school was again introduced to the South Green area in 1794, which became the English High School from 1836 to 1874. Most of the surviving structures in the district are houses. The oldest is the c. 1653 Whipple House, which was moved to the area in the 1930s. The green is flanked by buildings dating through the 19th century, in a variety of styles. The predominant styles are Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival, although there are several later Victorian properties. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Built in the first quarter of the 18th century, it is a good example of late First Period architecture. It suffered serious fire damage in 1998, but underwent a meticulous restoration. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Smith House stands in a rural- residential area of eastern Ipswich, on the north side of Argilla Road, roughly midway between Northgate Road and Fox Creek Road. It is oriented facing nearly south (the road runs east-northeast), and is screened from the road by mature plantings. It is a 2-1/2 story colonial style house with five window bays and a center chimney. It features an integral leanto section at its rear (rather than being a later addition). A number of the critical framing members of its construction are still exposed, showing workmanship that is typical of the First Period, but there are also typical Georgian period features, such as a plastered ceiling and wood paneling, and the stairway to the second floor is Georgian in character. The main entrance is sheltered by a small gabled Greek Revival porch. The exact date of construction is not known with certainty. Architectural analysis places its construction toward the later end of the First Period of colonial construction, which ended around 1725. Other evidence suggests it may have been built about 1720 by Abraham Tilton, Jr. The house was extensively damaged by fire in 1998, and underwent a meticulous restoration by its owners, using period building techniques and salvage materials from 18th and 19th-century buildings. The building is the subject of a preservation easement held by the Ipswich Historic Commission.

Calbia is a small Balkan nation in southeastern Europe. It lies on the Adriatic Sea and is bordered by Greece, Albania, Macedonia, Serbia, and Montenegro. There are farmlands in the valleys and some flatlands. Otherwise it is heavily forested, usually with firs, and mountainous. The nation is largely undeveloped, though not a poor nation. One section of Calbia is rich in petroleum fields and dotted with oil wells. Asphalt roads, air fields, and development derived from this petroleum money were spreading throughout the nation in the 1930s. Calbia had an army, air force, and nascent navy. The capital of Calbia is San Blazna. The city streets are generally narrow, walled in by a profusion of houses built over the centuries. San Blazna lies on the River Carlos, named after the founder of the royal dynasty of Calbia, which is crossed by two large bridges. In the center of San Blazna on the left bank of the River Carlos is an ancient castle which serves as the king's palace. In medieval times the river was diverted into a moat around the castle. This moat is surrounded by a large esplanade which serves as the main promenade of the capital. In one part of town is an ancient stone house, now a national museum, which was the peasant home of the first King Le Galbin. Out the very outskirts of the capital is an old graystone citadel, a simple structure of one domed tower complete with subterranean dungeons, which was constructed by the first king of Calbia perhaps for defensive military reasons. The Calbian language is a dialect of Slavic-romance languages, the latter probably due to its proximity to Italy. Calbia is a kingdom, ruled by a dynastic monarchy. The King of Calbia in 1934 at the time of The King Maker is Dal Le Galbin. However, the nation was forward thinking and had progressive political movements such as democratic parties and a Calbia National Women's Suffrage League. Researcher Thomas Fortenberry has suggested that Calbia is the model for another fictional country, Latveria found in the Marvel Universe. The action of The King Maker may also form the basis for the Marvel Comics supervillain character Doctor Doom, especially when combined with another Doc Savage villain, John Sunlight. Furthermore, Fortenberry contends that The King Maker is the origin of the fictional nation of Novenia, found in the Prince Zarkon series by Lin Carter. This series was a self-admitted pastiche in honor of Doc Savage.

Probably built about 1750, it is one of the city's oldest surviving structures, and has a long association with a prominent local family. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Southwick House is located west of downtown Peabody, on the north side of Lowell Street just west of its junction with Southwick Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide but slightly asymmetrical, with a center entrance framed by simply moulded corner boards with rosette blocks at the tops. An ell, built soon after the main block, extends along the rear, giving the house a saltbox profile, and extending beyond the sides of the main block by one bay in what is locally known as a \\"Beverly jog\\". The interior follows a typical center chimney plan, with parlors on either side of the chimney, and the kitchen behind. There are many original period finishes on the interior, including floorboards, paneling, and trim. The house was traditionally claimed to be built about 1660, but was more likely built about 1750, possibly on the side of an earlier building. The land was first settled by John Southwick, a persecuted Quaker who had been banished from Danvers for his beliefs. The Southwick family became a significant presence in what is now Peabody, operating a tavern and becoming one of its largest landowners. In the 19th century they became involved in the manufacture of pottery, and in the tanning business. This house remained in the family until 1816.

It is centered on the falls of the Spicket River, from which the 19th century textile mills of Methuen derived their power. The historic district, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, includes commercial and civic buildings in and near Gaunt Square, the heart of the city, and along both sides of the Spicket River between Gaunt Square and the Boston and Maine Railroad tracks south of the river. It abuts the residential Pleasant-High Historic District, which lies to its east. The falls of the Spicket River were the site of small scale industrial works in the 18th century, but the area did not begin to take shape as the town center until larger-scale development began in the 1820s. The oldest buildings that survive are brick buildings constructed in 1825 and 1826, when the main \\"A\\" mill was built. The complex was expanded in the 1840s with the construction of a wood frame cotton processing mill and a brick warehouse near the railroad. Industrial David Nevins added six more buildings and a new dam between 1879 and 1882. The city center's growth along Broadway and the Gaunt Square area mirrored the expansion of the mills over time. The area had long been a stop on the north-south route, and hotels and taverns dating from the middle 19th century survive, including the Masonic Hall, which was formerly a hotel. The old brick town hall, from whose parking lot fine views of the Spicket valley are seen, was built in 1853 with Greek Revival styling. Notable early 20th century additions to the area include the central fire station (1899, Romanesque Revival), the Oddfellows' Hall (1904, Renaissance Revival), and the 1909 railroad station, built in Queen Anne style with funds donated by philanthropist Edward Searles.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history St. Michael's is set on a property that primarily faces Summer Street to the south, even though its address is on Pleasant Street to the north. The church building was constructed in 1714, originally as a parish church of the Church of England, and twenty-nine of the original thirty-three donors were sea captains. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts provided the church with its first rector. The original square church was expanded in 1728. During the American Revolutionary War in 1776 a mob of patriots raided the church and removed the British royal coat of arms from the building. Many of St. Michael's members were Loyalists who fled to Canada during the Revolution. In 1793 the original spire on the bell tower was taken down 'being rotten.' The building was renovated in 1833 with Gothic windows, new pews and with the altar, a pulpit and original reredos at the north end. Stained glass windows by Redding & Baird were installed in the Gothic windows in 1888. The windows over the south entrance were added later. The church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.Historica churches of America by Nellie Urner Wallington (Duffield, 1907) In the 1980s, residing activity uncovered some of the original window configuration, and archaeological activity was done in its crypt area to study 18th-century burial practices.

Built in 1880, it was the town's first modern graded school, and is a prominent local example of Colonial Revival architecture. It was named for a native son, United States Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, and served as a public school until 1978. It is now in residential use. it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The former Story School is located north of downtown Marblehead, on the southeast side of Elm Street opposite its junction with Curtis Street. Now predominantly residential, the area was until an 1877 fire an industrial area with many small shoe factories. It is a two-story red brick building, with a hip roof and Colonial Revival styling. Windows are set in segmented-arch openings with keystones at the tops, and there is a gabled pedimented in the roof above the main entrance, in a section that projects slightly. The entrance, a double door, is also set in a segmented-arch opening, with a large single-pane transom window. Above the entrance is a tall doubled three-sash window. The rear facade is similar to the front, but with simpler detailing and lacking the projecting center section. Early education in Marblehead was largely conducted in private homes of teachers or other such facilities, with college preparation typically taking place at the private Marblehead Academy, founded in 1789 by Dr. Elisha Story and others. In the first half of the 19th century, the town established a series of district schools, including one at the site of this building. In the 1870s, the town's population surged, buoyed by local shoe manufacturing industry, increasing pressure on the town to improve its educational infrastructure. This building, completed in 1880, was the first brick school built by the town, and its first major investment in improved education. It was named for Joseph Story, the son of Dr. Elisha Story and a noted associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. The school served the town until 1978, and was then converted into residential units.

Together with Ivo Snijders, Dylan van der Linde and Coen Eggenkamp he finished on the 9th position. With Karel Dormans, Jeroen Spaans and Joeri de Groot he finished third at the 2001 Rowing World Cup meeting in Seville, a fifth place in Munich and sixth at the World Championships in Luzern In 2002 Van der Linden totally focused on the lightweight double sculls together with Ivo Snijders. They became ninth and seventh in the World Cup meetings in Hazewinkel and Luzern before winning the silver medal at the Under-23 World Championships. At the senior World Championships in Seville they became 10th. Van der Linden, Snijders, Karel Dormans as well as Joeri de Groot started a new adventure in the lightweight double sculls in 2003, finishing second in the Munich World Cup and fourth in Luzern. These pre-tournament results earned them a place for the World Championships in Milan where they won the silver medal. Their next aim was to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics and with a seventh place in Pozna≈Ñ, a fourth in Munich and a fifth in Luzern they succeeded and could pack their bags for Athens. They aimed for a medal at the Olympics but came just short and had to be satisfied with a fourth place. He then decided to row in the lightweight single scull in 2005, finishing fifth in Eton, third in Munich and sixth in Luzern, before becoming fifth at the World Championships in Gifu. His 2006 results were almost equal with a fourth place in Munich, a fifth in Luzern and a sixth at the World Championships in Eton. In 2007 he made his comeback in the lightweight fours boat with Wolter Blankert, Arnoud Greidanus and Ivo Snijders in Linz where they finished in fourth position. With Roeland Lievens and Paul Drewes as replacements of Blankert and Greidanus they improved their result to a third place in Luzern and they created some high expectations for the World Championships in Munich. They could not keep up with the expectations and only finished in a tenth position in Germany. For the 2008 season he rowed with Greidanus, Snijders, and Marshall Godschalk to an eight place at the World Cup in Munich. After they finished ninth in Luzern, Greidanus was replaced by Paul Drewes, and in Pozna≈Ñ they rowed to a fifth place, which meant qualification for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

The mall and courthouse were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and included in the Newburyport Historic District in 1984.  Superior Courthouse  The courthouse, designed by architect Charles Bulfinch who also designed the Massachusetts State House in Boston, was built in 1805. Architecturally, the building has two stories and was designed and built in the Federal style. According to young archival researcher Tyler Hoover, \\"It was the first courthouse of its type because the courtroom was on the second floor instead of the first floor.\\" Originally, the courthouse had brick pillars and arches that supported the second floor, and also displayed a statue of \\"a female figure, representing Justice, holding a pair of scales in her right hand.\\" The Courthouse has undergone various renovations since 1805, first in 1853, when the front side of the courthouse was remodeled, the statue of Justice was removed, and the roof replaced with Italianate; and then again in 1973. Author/Historian Euphemia Vale, in her 1854 history of Newburyport, wrote that \\"The [1853] alterations cost $12,400, and the new furnishing of the rooms brought the total expense of the improvements up to more than $13,000.\\" According to the paperwork on file with the government of Newburyport, after construction of the Superior Courthouse was completed as a joint undertaking by the town and county, annual town meetings were held therein until 1834. The space was also used during that time as a location for a summer school for girls. On April 18, 1834, a town committee was appointed to sell off the town's financial interest in the building. Their goal was achieved by June 3 of that same year and the property officially came under the ownership of Essex County. Many historically relevant figures argued cases within the Superior Courthouse, including Daniel Webster, John Quincy Adams, and Caleb Cushing.  Bartlett Mall  Bartlett Mall, which runs in front of the courthouses along High Street near its intersection with Green Street, predates the 1764 separation of Newburyport from Newbury. Even prior to the building of the courthouse, it is noted that Bartlett Mall \\"has always been a focal point of the community.\\" See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Essex County, Massachusetts References Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Essex County, Massachusetts Category:Newburyport, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Essex County, Massachusetts Category:Charles Bulfinch buildings Category:Historic district contributing properties in Massachusetts ","title":"Superior Courthouse and Bartlett Mall"},{"id":"18760713","text":"Bayou Teche National Wildlife Refuge is located in the coastal towns of Franklin, Garden City and Centerville on Bayou Teche in Louisiana, USA.

It is a large piece, lasting around forty minutes according to the score, but ranging from 30 to 50 minutes in recordings attended by the composer.compare also 46 minutes 23 seconds in Herbert Henck's performance (ECM 1621), 54 minutes 23 seconds in Stefan Litwin's (cpo 999 569‚Äì2). It is in a single movement divided into two connected sections, roughly equal in length.  Influences  The densely dissonant polyphonic texture of the work resembles the Second Piano Sonata of Pierre Boulez, a work Barraqu√© knew well. In performance, however, the overall impact is quite different from anything of Boulez, and has often been claimed (e.g. by Hodeir (1961)), to be akin in spirit to the late sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven.\\"Without doubt the most significant since Hammerklavier\\" ‚Äì Halbreich (1987). In its turn, Barraqu√©'s Sonata spurred his pupil Bill Hopkins to compose his cycle of Etudes en S√©rie, which develops some of Barraqu√©'s serial techniques, and its scale, but has its own musical characteristics.  Structure  Paul Griffiths has written of the music of the sonata: 'contrasts of themes or keys are replaced by other polarities, in particular between perceptions of notes as sounds (acontextual, as if heard alone) and as tones (part of the unfolding of a serial form), between freedom and fixity in the registral placing of notes, between pulsed and pulseless rhythm and between sound and silence. In his preface to the composition Barraqu√© drew attention to another opposition, between a \\"free style\\" of motifs and chords in easy flow and a \\"strict style\\" of intensive, quasi- automatic process acknowledging the total serialism of the time. Compulsion, embodied in the strict music, may seem to spur protest in the free passages. But protest is compromised by having to be voiced in the same language, based on the same series.'Paul Griffiths, notes (1998) to 'Jean Barraqu√©, The Complete Works' (cpo 999 569‚Äì2), booklet pp. 24‚Äì5. Herbert Henck has also noted: 'The overall structure was based on juxtaposing a fast movement with a slow one of equal weight. But as the fast movement built up, slow sections were increasingly introduced, and the slow movement contained some fast ones, so that there was a balance of contrasts within the work as a whole. The piece closed in unison in a mediating tempo with a twelve-tone row, whose basic form determined the pitch structure of the whole work.'Herbert Henck, 'Jean Barraqu√©'s Sonata', in booklet for ECM 1621 (1997).  Performance History  The sonata was recorded commercially by Yvonne Loriod between 28 and 30 October 1957 and issued in 1958. This recording was made in the presence of the composer, and from the manuscript, which was corrected and modified by the composer during the sessions. It was not given its first performance in public until 24 April 1967, when the Danish pianist Elisabeth Klein played it in a recital in Copenhagen, seemingly unaware that she was in fact giving the world premi√®re.Griffiths, Paul, The Sea on Fire: Jean Barraqu√©. Rochester NY, Rochester University Press, 2003, p.47 The Sonata was subsequently recorded commercially by Claude Helffer in 1969 and Roger Woodward in 1972, both also in the presence of the composer. A concert recording from 1972 by Francoise Thinat, prepared with the composer, has also been released on CD. The new critical edition of the Sonata by Heribert Henrich was given its first performance from an early draft, in 2012 in Berlin, by Nicolas Hodges.Henrich 2019, p. 79 The concert also included the world premiere by Hodges of Barraqu√©'s juvenile piano works and songs. The new edition was given its first recording by Jean-Pierre Collot in 2018, release 2019 (see Discography). Published editions The Sonata had been published by Aldo Bruzzichelli, Florence in 1966; the rights have since transferred to B√§renreiter-Verlag of Kassel.

It is bounded by Bradstreet Rd., Green and Main Sts. and Park Way in North Andover, Massachusetts. The district encompasses Memorial Park, the Stevens Library, and properties facing Memorial Park and further along Bradstreet Road. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The Tavern Acres development is set in a suburban residential area of northern North Andover. Main Street, the eastern boundary is a major north-south road, and Green Street is a collector road running through the residential area. The northernmost part of the district is the triangular intersection of these two streets and Davis Street, in which the Stevents Library stands. The Davis Street stretch is functionally part of the library's parking area. South of the library, across Davis Street, stands Memorial Park, a five-sided grassy area about in size. At its northern end, near the library, is the Patriots Monument, which honors North Andover's military personnel. Bradstreet Road defines the southern boundary of Memorial Park. Ringing the north, east, and south sides of the park, and extending east along Bradstreet Road are a collection of houses that were all built as part of the initial Tavern Acres development. This development had its origin in a series of land acquisitions in the 1860s by Moses Tyler Stevens, whose family owned many mills in the area. In 1904 Stevens donated land and funds for construction of the library, which was completed in 1907, after his death, and was named in his honor. Stevens' heirs sought to develop the remainder of the parcel, and retained the famed Olmsted Brothers landscape firm to lay out the master plan. The Tavern Land Company, formed by the heirs to manage this development, contracted with Charles R. Waite of E. M. Parsons to design most of the houses that it built before the company dissolved in 1924. Only twenty houses were built by the partnership and are included in the district. These houses are general 2-1/2 story wood frame structures, in Colonial Revival, Dutch Colonial, and Craftsman styles. Fourteen of the properties include garages as part of the original plan, which are considered contributing elements to the district. The houses and properties are organized to have a certain degree of uniformity in setting and scale.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 20, 1984. It is the only surviving element of the large estate of Charles H. Tenney, a leading local industrialist. History The gatehouse was originally a two-story rough stone farm house built by Richard Whittier between August and November 1830. In April 1882, it was purchased by Charles H. Tenney. It was redesigned in 1883 by architects Damon Brothers into a gatehouse for the Tenney estate known as Grey Court. When first built, it was a two-story stone structure with five bays on its front facade and a central entry. The modifications by Damon gave the building a distinctive Queen Anne Victorian character, changing the roof to be hipped, and adding an ornately decorated tower with weathervane on one corner. A porch was added to shelter the entry, whose gable has rows of decorative shingles. The interior features Anglo-Japanese wallpaper that was replicated in 1999. In 1951, the Tenney family gave to the town for Tenney High School (now Tenney Grammar School). The family offered the castle and the 80-acre estate to the town of Methuen which rejected the generous gift. It was later sold to the Basilian Salvatorian Order. In the 1970s, after the Basilian Salvatorian Order vacated the property, the castle was used as a substance abuse treatment center and was then abandoned, boarded-up, looted and vandalized. A series of fires over a number of years heavily damaged the mansion. A major fire, intentionally set, destroyed the roof and most of the interior. Instead of preserving the still-impressive ruins of this Carrere and Hastings Beaux-Arts mansion, which despite the fire, still featured original exterior terracotta details, brickwork, and granite walls, the remains were almost completely demolished by approval of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management. The town government of Methuen did not act to prevent the demolition either. Of the mansion, only a very small corner and a section of the interior courtyard arcade exist. The ruins are currently in poor condition and continue to be vandalized. The Gatehouse, is now home to the Methuen Museum of History and maintained by the Methuen Historical Society. The Stock House or Stables remain standing as part of the original estate. The Tenney estate is currently a Massachusetts state park, known as Greycourt Park. 300px See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Methuen, Massachusetts * National Register of Historic Places listings in Essex County, Massachusetts References Category:Castles in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Methuen, Massachusetts Category:Gates in the United States Category:Methuen, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Methuen, Massachusetts Category:Gatehouses (architecture) ","title":"Tenney Castle Gatehouse"},{"id":"18760780","text":"Stem cell doping is the postulated practice of enhancing athletic performance through various beneficial effects of stem cells injected into the bloodstream or otherwise introduced into the body.

The common, established by 1650, is the traditional civic and religious center of the town, and is surrounded by houses dating from the 17th to 20th centuries, the town hall, library, and Congregational church. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history Colonial settlement of the area that is now Topsfield began in the 1630s, as colonists moved up the Ipswich River. By 1650, the year of the town's incorporation, a training ground for the local militia had been established. The town's first meeting house was built in 1703, where the present Greek Revival First Congregational Church (built 1842) now stands. Standing northeast of the common is the district's oldest building, the Parson Capen House; a National Historic Landmark built in 1683, it is one of the best-preserved houses of the period in the United States, and is now a historic house museum. The common is now an irregularly shaped collection of triangular greens, divided by and bounded by the five roadways radiating in all directions. The northern side of the common, bounded by Washington Street and North Common, is lined by houses dating mainly from the early 19th century. The congregational church occupies a triangular section at the western side of the common, while the town hall (Chateau style, 1873) and public library (Classical Revival, 1935) dominate the southwest and southern edges. Facing the eastern side of the common is a large Federal mansion, built 1815 for a member of the locally prominent Emerson family; it is now part of a local preschool.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986, and continues to serve as Beverly's main post office. Description and history Beverly's main post office is located west of downtown Beverly, at the eastern end of Odell Park, which separates it from the historic Beverly Depot. It is a single story building built out of sandstone in a Classical Revival style. The front facade has a projecting portico supported by six Doric columns on a granite base, with granite steps leading up to a recessed entrance. The lobby area occupies the front of the main block, and is styled with terrazzo marble. There are one-bay wings on either side of the main block, which house offices. The roofline has an extended overhanging eave, above which is a parapet and a smaller gabled section topped by an octagonal cupola. The interior lobby areas retain original multicolored marble terrazzo flooring as well as period woodwork. The post office was begun in 1910 and opened in 1912, to a design by Treasury architect James Knox Taylor. Taylor retired in 1912, so this building represents one of his later designs. It is in part unusual because most buildings of this type have flat roofs, while this one is gabled. A rear addition, in buff brick, was made to the building in 1935 with funding from the Public Works Administration. It was built as part of a projected urban renewal project in the neighborhood that was never fully realized.

Let f be an arithmetic function. We say that an average order of f is g if : \\\\sum_{n \\\\le x} f(n) \\\\sim \\\\sum_{n \\\\le x} g(n) as x tends to infinity. It is conventional to choose an approximating function g that is continuous and monotone. But even so an average order is of course not unique. In cases where the limit : \\\\lim_{N\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n \\\\le N} f(n)=c exists, it is said that f has a mean value (average value) c. Examples * An average order of , the number of divisors of , is ; * An average order of , the sum of divisors of , is ; * An average order of , Euler's totient function of , is ; * An average order of , the number of ways of expressing as a sum of two squares, is ; * The average order of representations of a natural number as a sum of three squares is ; * The average number of decompositions of a natural number into a sum of one or more consecutive prime numbers is ; * An average order of , the number of distinct prime factors of , is ; * An average order of , the number of prime factors of , is ; * The prime number theorem is equivalent to the statement that the von Mangoldt function has average order 1; * An average order of , the M√∂bius function, is zero; this is again equivalent to the prime number theorem. Calculating mean values using Dirichlet series In case F is of the form : F(n)=\\\\sum_{d \\\\mid n} f(d), for some arithmetic function f(n), one has, : \\\\sum_{n \\\\le x} F(n)=\\\\sum_{d \\\\le x} f(d) \\\\sum_{n\\\\le x, d\\\\mid n} 1=\\\\sum_{d \\\\le x} f(d)[x/d] = x\\\\sum_{d \\\\le x} \\\\frac{f(d)}{d} \\\\text+ O(\\\\sum_{d \\\\le x} f(d)).\\\\qquad\\\\qquad (1) Generalizations of the previous identity are found here. This identity often provides a practical way to calculate the mean value in terms of the Riemann zeta function. This is illustrated in the following example. The density of the k-th power free integers in  For an integer k \\\\geq 1 the set Q_k of k-th-power-free integers is : Q_k :={n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\mid n \\\\text{ is not divisible by } d^k \\\\text{ for any integer } d\\\\ge 2}. We calculate the natural density of these numbers in , that is, the average value of 1_{Q_k}, denoted by \\\\delta(n), in terms of the zeta function. The function \\\\delta is multiplicative, and since it is bounded by 1, its Dirichlet series converges absolutely in the half-plane \\\\mathrm{Re}(s)>1, and there has Euler product : \\\\sum_{Q_k}n^{-s}=\\\\sum_n \\\\delta(n)n^{-s}=\\\\prod_p (1+p^{-s}+\\\\cdots +p^{-s(k-1)})=\\\\prod_p \\\\left(\\\\frac{1-p^{-sk}}{1-p^{-s}}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{\\\\zeta(s)}{\\\\zeta(sk)}. By the M√∂bius inversion formula, we get : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta(ks)}=\\\\sum_{n}\\\\mu(n)n^{-ks}, where \\\\mu stands for the M√∂bius function. Equivalently, : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta(ks)}=\\\\sum_{n}f(n)n^{-s}, where f(n)=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\;\\\\;\\\\, \\\\mu(d) & n=d^{k}\\\\ \\\\;\\\\;\\\\, 0 & \\\\text{otherwise}, \\\\end{cases} and hence, : \\\\frac{\\\\zeta(s)}{\\\\zeta(sk)}=\\\\sum_n (\\\\sum_{d\\\\mid n}f(d))n^{-s}. By comparing the coefficients, we get : \\\\delta(n)=\\\\sum_{d\\\\mid n}f(d)n^{-s}. Using (1), we get : \\\\sum_{d \\\\le x}\\\\delta(d)=x\\\\sum_{d \\\\le x}(f(d)/d)+O(x^{1/k}). We conclude that, : \\\\sum_{n\\\\in Q_k, n \\\\le x}1=\\\\frac{x}{\\\\zeta(k)}+O(x^{1/k}), where for this we used the relation : \\\\sum_n (f(n)/n)=\\\\sum_n f(n^k)n^{-k}=\\\\sum_n \\\\mu(n)n^{-k}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta(k)}, which follows from the M√∂bius inversion formula. In particular, the density of the square-free integers is \\\\zeta(2)^{-1}=\\\\frac{6}{\\\\pi^{2}}. Visibility of lattice points We say that two lattice points are visible from one another if there is no lattice point on the open line segment joining them. Now, if gcd(a, b) = d > 1, then writing a = da2, b = db2 one observes that the point (a2, b2) is on the line segment which joins (0,0) to (a, b) and hence (a, b) is not visible from the origin. Thus (a, b) is visible from the origin implies that (a, b) = 1. Conversely, it is also easy to see that gcd(a, b) = 1 implies that there is no other integer lattice point in the segment joining (0,0) to (a,b). Thus, (a, b) is visible from (0,0) if and only if gcd(a, b) = 1. Notice that \\\\frac{\\\\varphi(n)}{n} is the probability of a random point on the square {(r,s)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} : \\\\max(r,s)=n} to be visible from the origin. Thus, one can show that the natural density of the points which are visible from the origin is given by the average, : \\\\lim_{N\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n\\\\le N} \\\\frac{\\\\varphi(n)}{n} = \\\\frac{6}{\\\\pi^2}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta(2)}. \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta(2)} is also the natural density of the square-free numbers in . In fact, this is not a coincidence. Consider the k-dimensional lattice, \\\\mathbb{Z}^{k}. The natural density of the points which are visible from the origin is \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta(k)}, which is also the natural density of the k-th free integers in . Divisor functions Consider the generalization of d(n): : \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha(n)=\\\\sum_{d\\\\mid n}d^\\\\alpha. The following are true: : \\\\sum_{n\\\\le x}\\\\sigma_{\\\\alpha}(n)= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\;\\\\;\\\\sum_{n\\\\le x}\\\\sigma_\\\\alpha(n)=\\\\frac{\\\\zeta(\\\\alpha+1)}{\\\\alpha+1}x^{\\\\alpha+1}+O(x^\\\\beta) & \\\\text{if } \\\\alpha>0, \\\\ \\\\;\\\\;\\\\sum_{n\\\\le x}\\\\sigma_{-1}(n)=\\\\zeta(2)x+O(\\\\log x) & \\\\text{if } \\\\alpha=-1, \\\\ \\\\;\\\\;\\\\sum_{n\\\\le x}\\\\sigma_\\\\alpha(n)=\\\\zeta(-\\\\alpha+1)x+O(x^{\\\\max(0,1+\\\\alpha)}) & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} where \\\\beta=max(1,\\\\alpha). Better average order This notion is best discussed through an example. From : \\\\sum_{n\\\\le x}d(n)=x\\\\log x+(2\\\\gamma-1)x+o(x) (\\\\gamma is the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant) and : \\\\sum_{n\\\\le x}\\\\log n=x\\\\log x-x+O(\\\\log x), we have the asymptotic relation :\\\\sum_{n\\\\le x}(d(n)-(\\\\log n+2\\\\gamma))=o(x)\\\\quad(x\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty), which suggests that the function \\\\log n+2\\\\gamma is a better choice of average order for d(n) than simply \\\\log n. Mean values over =Definition Let h(x) be a function on the set of monic polynomials over Fq. For n\\\\ge 1 we define : \\\\text{Ave}_n(h)=\\\\frac{1}{q^n}\\\\sum_{f \\\\text{ monic},\\\\deg(f)= n}h(f). This is the mean value (average value) of h on the set of monic polynomials of degree n. We say that g(n) is an average order of h if : \\\\text{Ave}_n(h) \\\\sim g(n) as n tends to infinity. In cases where the limit, : \\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\text{Ave}_n(h)=c exists, it is said that h has a mean value (average value) c. Zeta function and Dirichlet series in  Let =A be the ring of polynomials over the finite field . Let h be a polynomial arithmetic function (i.e. a function on set of monic polynomials over A). Its corresponding Dirichlet series define to be : D_{h}(s)=\\\\sum_{f\\\\text{ monic}}h(f)f^{-s}, where for g\\\\in A, set g=q^{deg(g)} if g e 0, and g=0 otherwise. The polynomial zeta function is then : \\\\zeta_{A}(s)=\\\\sum_{f\\\\text{ monic}}f^{-s}. Similar to the situation in , every Dirichlet series of a multiplicative function h has a product representation (Euler product): : D_{h}(s)=\\\\prod_{P}(\\\\sum_{n\\\\mathop =0}^{\\\\infty}h(P^{n})P^{-sn}), Where the product runs over all monic irreducible polynomials P. For example, the product representation of the zeta function is as for the integers: \\\\zeta_{A}(s)=\\\\prod_{P}(1-P^{-s})^{-1}. Unlike the classical zeta function, \\\\zeta_{A}(s) is a simple rational function: \\\\zeta_{A}(s)=\\\\sum_{f}(f^{-s})=\\\\sum_{n}\\\\sum_{\\\\text{deg(f)=n}}q^{-sn}=\\\\sum_{n}(q^{n-sn})=(1-q^{1-s})^{-1}. In a similar way, If ∆í and g are two polynomial arithmetic functions, one defines ∆í * g, the Dirichlet convolution of ∆í and g, by : \\\\begin{align} (f*g)(m) &= \\\\sum_{d\\\\,\\\\mid \\\\,m} f(m)g\\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{d}\\\\right) \\\\ &= \\\\sum_{ab\\\\,=\\\\,m}f(a)g(b) \\\\end{align} where the sum extends over all monic divisors d of m, or equivalently over all pairs (a, b) of monic polynomials whose product is m. The identity D_h D_g =D_{h*g} still holds. Thus, like in the elementary theory, the polynomial Dirichlet series and the zeta function has a connection with the notion of mean values in the context of polynomials. The following examples illustrate it. ExamplesThe density of the k-th power free polynomials in = Define \\\\delta(f) to be 1 if f is k-th power free and 0 otherwise. We calculate the average value of \\\\delta, which is the density of the k-th power free polynomials in , in the same fashion as in the integers. By multiplicativity of \\\\delta: : \\\\sum_f \\\\frac{\\\\delta(f)}{f^s}=\\\\prod_{P}(\\\\sum_{j \\\\mathop =0}^{k-1}(P^{-js}))=\\\\prod_{P}\\\\frac{1-P^{-sk}}{1-P^{-s}}=\\\\frac{\\\\zeta_A(s)}{\\\\zeta_A(sk)}=\\\\frac{1-q^{1-ks}}{1-q^{1-s}}=\\\\frac{\\\\zeta_A(s)}{\\\\zeta_A(ks)} Denote b_n the number of k-th power monic polynomials of degree n, we get : \\\\sum_{f}\\\\frac{\\\\delta(f)}{f^{s}}=\\\\sum_{n}\\\\sum_{\\\\text{def}f=n}\\\\delta(f)f^{-s}=\\\\sum_{n}b_{n}q^{-sn}. Making the substitution u=q^{-s} we get: : \\\\frac{1-qu^k}{1-qu}=\\\\sum_{n \\\\mathop =0}^\\\\infty b_{n}u^{n}. Finally, expand the left-hand side in a geometric series and compare the coefficients on u^{n} on both sides, to conclude that b_{n}=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\;\\\\;\\\\,q^{n} & n\\\\le k-1 \\\\ \\\\;\\\\;\\\\, q^{n}(1-q^{1-k}) &\\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} Hence, \\\\text{Ave}_{n}(\\\\delta)=1-q^{1-k}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta_{A}(k)} And since it doesn't depend on n this is also the mean value of \\\\delta(f). =Polynomial Divisor functions= In , we define : \\\\sigma _{k}(m)=\\\\sum_{fm, \\\\text{ monic}}f^k. We will compute \\\\text{Ave}_{n}(\\\\sigma_{k}) for k\\\\ge 1. First, notice that : \\\\sigma_{k}(m)=h*\\\\mathbb{I}(m) where h(f)=f^{k} and \\\\;\\\\mathbb{I}(f)=1\\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall{f}. Therefore, : \\\\sum_{m}\\\\sigma_{k}(m)m^{-s}=\\\\zeta_{A}(s)\\\\sum_{m}h(m)m^{-s}. Substitute q^{-s}=u we get, : \\\\text{LHS}=\\\\sum_n(\\\\sum_{\\\\deg(m)=n} \\\\sigma_k(m))u^n, and by Cauchy product we get, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\text{RHS} &=\\\\sum_n q^{n(1-s)}\\\\sum_{n}(\\\\sum_{\\\\deg(m)=n}h(m))u^n \\\\ &=\\\\sum_n q^n u^n \\\\sum_{l}q^l q^{lk}u^l \\\\ &=\\\\sum_n (\\\\sum_{j \\\\mathop =0}^{n}q^{n-j}q^{jk+j}) \\\\ &=\\\\sum_n (q^n(\\\\frac{1-q^{k(n+1)}}{1-q^k})) u^n. \\\\end{align} Finally we get that, : \\\\text{Ave}_n\\\\sigma_k=\\\\frac{1-q^{k(n+1)}}{1-q^k}. Notice that : q^n \\\\text{Ave}_n\\\\sigma_{k}=q^{n(k+1)}(\\\\frac{1-q^{-k(n+1)}}{1-q^{-k}})=q^{n(k+1)}(\\\\frac{\\\\zeta(k+1)}{\\\\zeta(kn+k+1)}) Thus, if we set x=q^n then the above result reads : \\\\sum_{\\\\deg(m)=n, m \\\\text{ monic}} \\\\sigma_k(m)=x^{k+1}(\\\\frac{\\\\zeta(k+1)}{\\\\zeta(kn+k+1)}) which resembles the analogous result for the integers: \\\\sum_{n\\\\le x}\\\\sigma_{k}(n)=\\\\frac{\\\\zeta(k+1)}{k+1}x^{k+1}+O(x^{k}) =Number of divisors= Let d(f) be the number of monic divisors of f and let D(n) be the sum of d(f) over all monics of degree n. \\\\zeta_A(s)^2=(\\\\sum_{h}h^{-s})(\\\\sum_gg^{-s})=\\\\sum_f(\\\\sum_{hg=f}1)f^{-s}=\\\\sum_f d(f)f^{-s}=D_d(s)=\\\\sum_{n \\\\mathop =0}^\\\\infty D(n)u^{n} where u=q^{-s}. Expanding the right-hand side into power series we get, : D(n)=(n+1)q^n. Substitute x=q^n the above equation becomes: : D(n)=x \\\\log_q(x)+x which resembles closely the analogous result for integers \\\\sum_{k \\\\mathop =1}^n d(k)=x\\\\log x+(2\\\\gamma-1) x + O(\\\\sqrt{x}), where \\\\gamma is Euler constant. Not much is known about the error term for the integers, while in the polynomials case, there is no error term! This is because of the very simple nature of the zeta function \\\\zeta_{A}(s), and that it has NO zeros. =Polynomial von Mangoldt function= The Polynomial von Mangoldt function is defined by: \\\\Lambda_{A}(f) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\log P & \\\\mbox{if }f=P^k \\\\text{ for some prime monic} P \\\\text{ and integer } k \\\\ge 1, \\\\ 0 & \\\\mbox{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} Where the logarithm is taken on the basis of q. Proposition. The mean value of \\\\Lambda_{A} is exactly 1. Proof. Let m be a monic polynomial, and let m=\\\\prod_{i \\\\mathop =1}^{l}P_{i}^{e_i} be the prime decomposition of m. We have, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{fm}\\\\Lambda_{A}(f) &= \\\\sum_{(i_1,\\\\ldots,i_l)0\\\\le i_j \\\\le e_j} \\\\Lambda_A(\\\\prod_{j \\\\mathop =1}^l P_j^{i_j})=\\\\sum_{j \\\\mathop =1}^l \\\\sum_{i \\\\mathop =1}^{e_i}\\\\Lambda_A (P_j^i) =\\\\sum_{j \\\\mathop =1}^l \\\\sum_{i \\\\mathop =1}^{e_i}\\\\logP_j\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{j \\\\mathop =1}^l e_j\\\\logP_j =\\\\sum_{j \\\\mathop =1}^l \\\\logP_j^{e_j}=\\\\log(\\\\prod_{i \\\\mathop =1}^l P_i^{e_i})\\\\ &= \\\\log(m) \\\\end{align} Hence, : \\\\mathbb{I}\\\\cdot\\\\Lambda_A(m)=\\\\logm and we get that, : \\\\zeta_{A}(s)D_{\\\\Lambda_{A}}(s)=\\\\sum_{m}logmm^{-s}. Now, : \\\\sum_m m^s = \\\\sum_n \\\\sum_{\\\\deg m=n} u^n=\\\\sum_n q^n u^{n}=\\\\sum_n q^{n(1-s)}. Thus, : \\\\frac{d}{ds}\\\\sum_m m^s=-\\\\sum_n \\\\log(q^n)q^{n(1-s)}=-\\\\sum_n \\\\sum_{\\\\deg(f)=n} \\\\log(q^n)q^{-ns}=-\\\\sum_f \\\\logff^{-s}. We got that: : D_{\\\\Lambda_A}(s)=\\\\frac{-\\\\zeta'_A(s)}{\\\\zeta_{A}(s)} Now, : \\\\sum_{m}\\\\Lambda_A (m)m^{-s}=\\\\sum_n(\\\\sum_{\\\\deg(m)=n}\\\\Lambda_A(m)q^{-sm})=\\\\sum_n(\\\\sum_{\\\\deg(m)=n}\\\\Lambda_A(m))u^n=\\\\frac{-\\\\zeta'_A(s)}{\\\\zeta_A(s)}=\\\\frac{q^{1-s}log(q)}{1-q^{1-s}} = \\\\log(q) \\\\sum_{n\\\\mathop=1}^\\\\infty q^n u^n Hence, : \\\\sum_{\\\\deg(m)=n}\\\\Lambda_A (m)=q^n \\\\log(q), and by dividing by q^n we get that, : \\\\text{Ave}_n \\\\Lambda_A(m)=\\\\log(q)=1. =Polynomial Euler totient function= Define Euler totient function polynomial analogue, \\\\Phi, to be the number of elements in the group (A/fA)^{*}.

Waldo House is a historic house at 233 Lawrence Street in Methuen, Massachusetts. Built in 1825 and altered somewhat around 1900 by local philanthropist Edward Searles, it is one of Methuen's finest examples of Federal period architecture. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and is currently occupied by the Kenneth H. Pollard Funeral Home. Description and history The Waldo House is set on the north side of Lawrence Street, a short way east of Methuen's central business district, and abutting the former estate of Edward Searles to the north. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, whose main block is five bays wide, and is topped by a hip roof with a distinctive monitor section. The central bay has an early 20th-century Colonial Revival 2-1/2 story projection, with a gabled top and a flat-roofed balconeyed portico supported by Ionic columns. A number of additions, also early 20th century additions, extend to the main block's side and rear. At the western edge of the property there are two massive stone columns of the Corinthian order, which are topped by urns. The main block of the house was built about 1825 by George A. Waldo, who was apparently in the shoemaking business, and involved in the development of Methuen's central business district. In 1872, the house is listed as being owned by John Low, a local druggist. Mrs. Mary Low sold the house in 1888 to Edward Searles, retaining a lifetime occupancy. In the early 20th century, when Searles was developing his large estate on the property to the north, he made significant additions to this house and property, which included creation of a small park whose entry was marked by the two large columns, which he had transported from New York City. The house became a funeral home in the 1960s.

The company owns and operates two of North America's largest malls, the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta and the Mall of America in Minnesota, both of which contain a wide variety of entertainment attractions alongside traditional retail. The company also owns the American Dream, which opened at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey on October 25, 2019. History=Early years (1965‚Äì1981) Germez Developments was founded by Jacob Ghermezian in 1965, and his family, the Iranian-Canadian Jewish Ghermezian family, remains the owners and operators of the company today. Jacob's four sons were the core of the business, and after them the brothers' children have begun to take leadership roles in the company, including CEO Don Ghermezian and Braze founder Mark Ghermezian. In the mid-1970s, Germez Developments was involved in land speculation on the outskirts of Edmonton. The province of Alberta established \\"restricted development areas\\" (RDAs) encircling Edmonton and Calgary in 1974, and two years later announced that the areas would be used as \\"transportation and utility corridors\\".\\"Transportation Utility Corridor - Introduction\\", Alberta Infrastructure. Germez was one of several companies that bought up large parts of the RDA ring around Edmonton, paying higher prices to rural landowners than the government was willing to offer. Despite not being allowed to develop the land, Germez dramatically raised its prices before selling its parcels back to the government.\\"Millions being made on RDA speculation\\", Medicine Hat News, February 1, 1982. The Ghermezians made an $18 million profit when the Albertan government purchased the land in 1979, and much of that profit was used to finance their first retail project, the West Edmonton Mall.  Entering retail (1981‚Äì1992)  Mindbender rollercoaster at the West Edmonton Mall The Ghermezians began developing the West Edmonton Mall in 1974.Goyette, Linda, and Carolina Jakeway Roemmich. Edmonton in Our Own Words, p. 329. University of Alberta Press, 2005. Early in the development process, Raphael Ghermezian was faced with allegations of attempted bribery towards an alderman on the Edmonton city council.\\"Alderman dumbfounded when offered $40,000\\", Lethbridge Herald, July 24, 1974. Eskandar Ghermezian retaliated with accusations of favor-seeking against the son of another Edmonton alderman.\\"Edmonton builder claims alderman's son sought favors\\", Lethbridge Herald, July 31, 1974. The first phase of the mall was completed in 1981, and Triple Five immediately began further construction for a second phase which opened in 1983 and a third in 1985. These expansions brought the West Edmonton Mall from the largest in Canada to the largest in the world. In addition to building the West Edmonton Mall, Triple Five also developed the Eaton's Centre mall and mixed-use development in downtown Edmonton, which began development in 1980\\"Eaton complex costs soar\\", Winnipeg Free Press, May 4, 1981. and opened in 1986. The Ghermezians held a 50% stake in the complex, alongside Confederation Life Insurance, which bought Triple Five's share of the development for $1 in 1991.\\"Triple Five sells stake in Edmonton mall for $1\\", Medicine Hat News, March 1, 1991. In 1985, Triple Five created Peoples Trust, a bank and trust company whose first branch was located in their West Edmonton Mall. When Peoples Trust opened, its primary focus was on residential mortgages and guaranteed investments. Today, there are branches across Canada, and the bank offers several other services, including mortgages for care facilities and other commercial properties, and prepaid credit cards. After the demolition of the Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota, in 1985, the Ghermezian brothers approached the Bloomington Port Authority with a proposal for their second mall, which would be larger than West Edmonton Mall was at the time.\\"Triple Five gets okay for giant mall project\\", Lethbridge Herald, July 3, 1985. The project was quickly approved, and ultimately became the Mall of America, which has remained the largest mall in the United States since it opened in 1992.  Searching for a third project (1986‚Äì2011)  The West Market area of the Mall of America Triple Five announced its plans in 1986 to build its third major project, considering Toronto, Montreal, and Niagara Falls, New York as possible locations.Martin, Douglas. \\"A Shopper's Paradise on the Prairie\\", New York Times, February 23, 1986. Montreal was dropped from consideration soon after, pitting the other two cities against each other for a project that was then dubbed \\"Fantasyworld\\".Kolbert, Elizabeth. \\"Niagara Falls Romances a Builder\\", New York Times, June 24, 1986. In the Toronto suburb of Mississauga, the first proposed location was rejected and the project was ultimately dropped.Kan, Alan. \\"5 Unbuilt Projects in Mississauga\\", InSauga.com, February 19, 2018. In Niagara Falls, the state of New York offered $400 million in subsidies to build Fantasyworld. The state later canceled its offer after deciding that the project was unlikely to be completed while Triple Five was preoccupied with building the Mall of America.Berkman, Seth. \\"'Dream' land: A look at the Canadian developers behind the Meadowlands megamall project\\", Inside Jersey magazine, November 17, 2014.\\"Aid Offer Rescinded for Niagara Falls Project\\", New York Times, April 12, 1987. The late-1980s Soviet policy of glasnost encouraged Western businesses to seek opportunities in Russia and the other Soviet republics. In December 1988, Triple Five proposed building a megamall in Moscow, competing with the Cyrus Eaton Group's similar proposal in Leningrad.\\"Canadians to build $5-billion Soviet park\\", Winnipeg Free Press, December 9, 1988. Both proposals were dropped, and within the month Triple Five had moved on to a proposal for a complex in Holbeck, Leeds, England. In addition to over of retail floor space, the Leeds development would have demolished significant parts of Holbeck to build a series of octagonal skyscrapers for mixed-use development.Leeds Centre & Motorways Sites: Initial Background Report March 1989, Triple Five Canada Developments Limited. The project was intended to be completed by 1993, but was never approved.\\"Edmonton mall developers launch major U.K. project\\", Winnipeg Free Press, December 22, 1988. Other Triple Five proposals prior to 1994 were made in Burnaby, British Columbia, Tampa, Florida, Beijing, China, Burbank, California, Oberhausen, Germany, and various cities in Japan. The American Dream Mall was first proposed for Silver Spring, Maryland, in the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington metropolitan area, in August 1995. A mixed-use development with an area of , Triple Five proposed that only be used for retail space, while also including an NHL-sized ice hockey rink, a large wave pool, an IMAX theater, and a Fantasyland hotel similar to the West Edmonton Mall hotel.Morgan, Perri. \\"Dream On: Will the Ghermezians‚Äô American Dream become Silver Spring‚Äôs nightmare?\\", Washington City Paper, April 5, 1996. With the support of Montgomery County, the plan grew to include \\"a multimedia educational facility, sports club, and wellness center\\", and at the request of a board of local residents, a performing arts center and a miniature golf course were added to the project. As with Fantasyworld in Niagara Falls, local and state governments in Maryland were concerned by the amount of public money that was expected to fund the project. Montgomery County gave up on the American Dream project by the end of 1996, and ultimately the site was used for a smaller commercial development called Downtown Silver Spring. In the early 2000s, Triple Five fought a legal battle over the majority ownership of the Mall of America. TIAA-CREF, who had held a 27.5% equity stake in the property since 1989, sold its share to Simon Property Group in 1999, making Simon the mall's majority owner. Triple Five sued, arguing that this deal was made in secret and that Simon breached its fiduciary duty in doing so. Simon was forced to sell the 27.5% stake to Triple Five when the case was decided in 2003, making Triple Five the majority owner of the mall it had developed and operated.Pristin, Terry. \\"Judge Rules Against Simon in Mall Suit\\", New York Times, September 12, 2003. Triple Five announced in 2004 that its next major project would be the Great Mall of Las Vegas. While not as large as the Mall of America, the plan for over of floor space still would have placed it among the largest shopping malls in the nation.\\"Company announces plans for largest mall in Las Vegas\\", Las Vegas Sun, March 25, 2004. The project was approved by local authorities in early 2008 and was expected to begin construction by the end of the year. However, plans for the mall were shelved as a result of the late 2000s recession, and by the end of 2010 Triple Five defaulted on the loan for the mall's intended real estate.\\"Developer buys Great Mall of Las Vegas parcel\\", Las Vegas Sun, January 4, 2011. West Edmonton Mall lost the title of world's largest shopping mall in 2004, with the opening of the Golden Resources Mall in Beijing, China. The following year, the New South China Mall in Dongguan opened and took the title, with an area of over . Triple Five has disputed whether these developments are actually shopping malls, and continues to claim that West Edmonton Mall is the world's largest. In 2005, Triple Five also attempted to enter the Chinese retail market with two proposed projects: the Mall of China in Dalian, and the Triple Five Wenzhou Mall in Wenzhou. Both of these were intended to feature over of floor space, and each would have become the largest mall in the world if completed.Barboza, David. \\"China, New Land of Shoppers, Builds Malls on Gigantic Scale\\", New York Times, May 25, 2005.Campanella, Thomas J. The Concrete Dragon: China's Urban Revolution and What it Means for the World, pg. 236. Chronicle Books, 2012. As of 2015, a project called \\"Triple Five China Dream\\" had been announced as an addition to the under-construction Beijing Daxing International Airport.Buchanan, Clare. \\"Mega mall planned for new Beijing airport\\", China Daily, September 23, 2015. Mark Ghermezian founded Appboy, a mobile marketing automation company based in New York City, in 2011. He has raised millions in venture capital investments from family members and Triple Five. The company, now known as Braze, advertises that it serves 420 million mobile users.  American Dream projects (2011‚Äìpresent)  American Dream in 2009, before Triple Five ownership On April 29, 2011, Triple Five took ownership of the unfinished Meadowlands Xanadu mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which had been under construction since 2004. The company had previously attempted to develop the site, having made a proposal for \\"MeadowFest America\\" in 2002 before construction on Meadowlands Xanadu began.Smothers, Ronald. \\"New Ideas Unveiled for Site of Meadowlands Arena\\", The New York Times, September 20, 2002. The project was renamed American Dream, placing it under a brand that had previously been used for the Silver Spring project. The mall was intended to open in fall 2013, but legal disputes with the New York Giants and Jets and financial setbacks have continually delayed construction. The company has pledged 49% of its West Edmonton Mall and Mall of America to finance this project. As with many of Triple Five's projects, the company has requested significant public funding to build American Dream Meadowlands, and has received hundreds of millions of dollars from the state of New Jersey to finish the project. The mall opened on October 25, 2019. Triple Five announced American Dream Miami in 2015, a project in Miami-Dade County, Florida which would become the largest mall in the United States if built. As of May 2018, the proposal for American Dream Miami has been approved by local authorities, but construction on the mall has not yet begun, pending regulatory approval.Hanks, Douglas. \\"Nation's largest mall wins Miami-Dade approval as county backs American Dream Miami\\", Miami Herald, May 17, 2018.

Description and history  With a construction history that is believed to date back to the last decade of the 17th century, the 2.5 story wood-frame house is claimed to be the oldest building in Weston. The house was extensively rehabilitated in 1961, at which time the restorer identified at least six different phases of construction. The first was c. 1696, in which a \\"half house\\" was built, three bays wide and two stories high, with a large chimney on one side. A leanto section was added to this structure's rear c. 1720. In about 1760, the house was greatly expanded, adding the two rooms on the east side of the chimney, as well as a two-story ell in the northeast. The older leanto section was rebuilt at this time. The final 18th century work was the addition of another shed addition to the northeast c. 1790. Then, in 1929 the shed addition was removed and a two-story ell added to the north face. In 1961, the entire building was restored, and the 1929 ell was replaced with a modern construction. In addition to its extensive architectural history, the building is notable for at least one of its occupants. Thomas Rand, who acquired the house in 1781 after it was confiscated from its Loyalist owner, was a soldier in the American Revolutionary War who served at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, and a housewright who worked on a number of municipal buildings. He also served on the town's board of selectmen during the Revolutionary War years, and filled other municipal offices as well. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 9, 1978.

Ashland Reservoir was constructed in 1885, impounding a portion of Cold Spring Brook, a tributary of the Sudbury River. The dam and spillway were built as part of Boston's second major water works effort, which impounded large portions of the upper Sudbury River. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history Ashland State Park is located off West Union Street in southern Ashland, a rural outer suburb west of Boston. Its centerpiece is the former Ashland Reservoir, with the dam and spillway at its northern end. From that point, Cold Spring Brook flows north to join a branch of the Sudbury River. The dam is an earthen embankment, built above bedrock and above the level of the reservoir. There is a concrete core wall about thick at the bottom and at the top. The spillway lies at the eastern end of the dam, and is constructed of granite rubble, and a series of steps made of granite laid in concrete. The spillway is long, and is naturalistically designed to resemble a brook descending through landscape. The dam was originally topped by a gatehouse; it was demolished in 1976 after repeated vandalism. The dam and spillway were built in 1885 as one of the later elements of Boston's second major water supply system. This system impounded large sections of the Sudbury River, primarily in Framingham, from where the water was piped toward Boston via the Sudbury Aqueduct. Water impounded by the Ashland dam was originally fed to the aqueduct by a pair of pipes. By 1927 the reservoir was part of the system's backup elements, and a pipe was laid to feed its water into the Sudbury Reservoir; this pipe was never used. The reservoir and surrounding land were turned over to the state, and are now administered by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.

The town of Ashland was incorporated in 1846 out of portions of neighboring Hopkinton, Holliston, and Framingham. Its town meetings were at first held in a combination school and meeting hall built in 1830 by local mill owners. In 1851 the town began considering the construction of a town house, resulting in construction of the present structure in 1855 on the site of the previous building. Originally three bays wide and five deep, two additional bays extended its length in 1905. At the same time, the Colonial Revival portico was added to the front, augmenting its otherwise Italianate and Greek Revival features.

Description and history The Stephen Bacon House is located north of Natick's modern downtown, on a lot bounded on the west by North Main Street (Massachusetts Route 27), the south by Gilbert Road, and the east by Franconia Avenue. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with asymmetrically placed windows and a roughly centered entrance. A four-bay 2-1/2 story ell extends to the right, set at a recess from the main block. A shed-roof ell extends to the rear, giving the house a saltbox profile. The interior of the house includes features typical of transitional late First Period houses, included a beaded summer beam, a side-facing oven in the front right chamber, and an exposed summer beam in the upper left chamber with chamfered edges. The oldest portion of this house is the left side front, which was built c. 1704 by Stephen Bacon, one of Natick's early settlers. The right side and the rear leanto were later 18th-century additions, as is the block to the right. This building appears on one of the earliest maps of the area (in 1724), and the town's first school classes were held here.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Rev. Stephen Badger House stands on the south side of the village of South Natick, at the southwest corner of Eliot Street and Badger Avenue. It is a two-story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a hip roof, two interior chimneys, and clapboarded exterior. The entrance is flanked by pilasters, and topped by a transom window and gabled pediment. A gabled dormer projects from the center of the roof. A single-story ell extends to the rear of the main block. The town of Natick was founded in 1650 as a community of Christianized [Praying Indian s, with its original town center at South Natick. Supported by an English missionary organization, it had four ministers before Stephen Badger arrived in 1753. He was granted a parcel of land that includes the place where this house now stands. Badger's tenure as missionary was troubled by the American Revolutionary War, when he was accused of being a Loyalist, and by increasing white settlement in the town. At least in part due to his loss of status, the town's main meeting house was moved to the present center, leading to South Natick's decline in civic importance. The property was sold out of the Badger family in 1822, to Oliver Bacon, a local businessman whose philanthropy includes South Natick's Bacon Free Library. In 1949 the house was restored to its c. 1870 appearance.

It is traditionally baked in a pot or steamed in special wooden casks by burying it in the ground near a hot spring, in which case it is known as hverabrau√∞ or \\"hot-spring-bread\\". Modern r√∫gbrau√∞ is usually made in a square baking pan. The bread is crustless, dark and very dense, usually rather sweet, and keeps for a long time. It is often served with butter, mutton p√¢t√©, hangikj√∂t (smoked lamb), or with pickled herring. Dry r√∫gbrau√∞ would be ground and mixed with buttermilk to form a kind of porridge. Stale r√∫gbrau√∞ is often soaked, then made into brau√∞s√∫pa (bread soup) - that is, simmered with raisins and flavorings (usually lemon) and served hot with whipped cream as a dessert. Excessive consumption of this bread is said to cause flatulence, earning it its nickname √ærumari which roughly translates as \\"thunderbread\\" or \\"thunderer\\". There are, however, varieties of the traditional rye bread with wheat and whole grain added to make it less dense, but also called r√∫gbrau√∞. These varieties tend to be less heavy than the traditional straight rye variety and more similar to the modern Danish rugbr√∏d or German pumpernickel. Rye, produced in Denmark and exported to Iceland, became the predominant cereal in Icelandic cuisine in the early modern period after a trade monopoly was instituted by the king of Denmark in 1602, remaining in vigor until 1786.

Born into an educated family from the Hutu ethnic group, Cimpaye acquired the reputation as a leading intellectual and became involved in politics in Burundi which was then under Belgian rule. His position in the minor conservative Christian Democratic Party (Parti d√©mocratique chr√©tien, PDC) opposed to the more popular anti-colonial Union for National Progress (Union pour le Progres national, UPRONA) led to his rise to the role of prime minister in 1961 before UPRONA was decisively returned in the country's first elections ahead of Burundi's independence in July 1962. He left politics but was arrested under the regime of Michel Micombero in 1969. While imprisoned, he wrote L'Homme de ma colline which has been acclaimed as the first Burundian novel but which remained unpublished in his lifetime. He was among a number of influential Hutus killed in the genocidal violence of 1972 instigated by the Micombero regime. Biography Cimpaye was born in 1929 in Mugera, Gitega Province in Ruanda-Urundi which was then under Belgian rule. A member of the Hutu ethnic group, his father had been employed as a medical assistant (assistant m√©dical) and was literate. This background enabled Cimpaye to receive further education at the Groupe Scolaire d'Astrida where he graduated as a veterinary technician in 1951. As one writer has noted, Cimpaye's √©lite background and education made him \\"an intellectual almost without peers in his era in Burundi\\". He entered colonial-era politics within the minor conservative Christian Democratic Party (Parti d√©mocratique chr√©tien, PDC) which formed part of an electoral coalition called the Union of Popular Parties (Union des parties populaires, UPP) against the more popular Union for National Progress (Union pour le Progr√®s national, UPRONA) under Prince Louis Rwagasore. Cimpaye served briefly as prime minister of an interim government between 26 January to 28 September 1961 shortly before the country gained full independence from Belgian colonial rule. However, UPRONA won the country's first elections decisively in 1961 and Rwagasore replaced Cimpaye as prime minister. Rwagasore's assassination in October the same year, attributed to supporters of the PDC, led to the radicalisation of politics in Burundi and forced Cimpaye to leave politics to pursue studies in Europe. Burundi became independent in July 1962. After returning to Burundi, Cimpaye worked for the Belgian airline Sabena as its head of public relations in Bujumbura. He was distrusted by Michel Micombero who came to power at the head of a radical Tutsi regime after a series of coups d'√©tat in 1965‚Äì66. Cimpaye was arrested in October 1969 for \\"endangering state security\\" and imprisoned for five years. During this time, he authored a French-language novel entitled L'homme de ma colline (, or 'District') which followed the struggles of a protagonist named Benedikto living in a rural part of Burundi during the colonial era. It addressed the theme of exile and has been praised for its use of language, particular Kirundi proverbs in translation. It has been hailed as the country's first novel although it remained unpublished until 2012. Cimpaye was among a number of Hutu public figures killed in the genocidal violence of 1972 under the Micombero regime.

According to Rodin, the sculpture aims to portray the writer's persona rather than a physical likeness. The work was commissioned in 1891 by the Soci√©t√© des Gens de Lettres, a full-size plaster model was displayed in 1898 at a Salon in Champ de Mars. After coming under criticism the model was rejected by the soci√©t√© and Rodin moved it to his home in Meudon. On July 2, 1939 (22 years after the sculptor's death) the model was cast in bronze for the first time and placed on the Boulevard du Montparnasse at the intersection with Boulevard Raspail. Casts and various studies of the sculpture are today in many different collections including the Ackland Art Museum, Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum in Antwerp, The Norton Simon Museum of Art, the Mus√©e Rodin in Meudon, the Rodin Museum in Philadelphia, the Hirshhorn Museum, the Hirschhorn Sculpture Garden (Smithsonian) in Washington D.C, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, in front of the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, Netherlands, in Caracas, Venezuela in the open spaces around the former Ateneo de Caracas, now UNEARTES and Balzac in the Robe of a Dominican Monk in Museo Soumaya in Mexico City. Today the artwork is sometimes considered the first truly modern sculpture. Commission The Soci√©t√© des Gens de Lettres (Paris, France) considered four different artists for the sculptural work before it was given to Rodin. The first was French neoclassical artist Henri Chapu, however, Chapu died in 1891 before the work could be finalized. Marquet de Vasselot was the next artist considered for the sculpture and provided a bust of the writer for the Societ√©. At the same time artists Millet and Coutan also applied for the commission. Rodin was not initially considered for the work because at that point in time, around 1885, his career had not become as prominent. After the death of Chapu, the recently elected president of the Societ√©, √âmile Zola strongly supported Rodin for the job and, so, the artist submitted a proposal to have a completed three-meter statue of the French novelist within an eighteen-month period which was approved. The commission was in response to the elevated importance of Honor√© de Balzac after his death. Balzac was one of the founders of the Societ√© as well as the second president of the organization. Upon his death in 1850 interest in creating a statue to commemorate the writer quickly developed under the leadership of Alexandre Dumas, p√®re. Preparation Instead of the designated eighteen-month period of time, Rodin employed a lengthy seven years to finish the work. Rodin became infatuated with the literature of his subject as well as researched the character and personality of Balzac, similar to the writer's own approach to character development. In preparation for the sculpture, Rodin read the author's works as well as traveled numerous times to the author's hometown of Touraine France in order to sketch and model clay portrait studies from individuals with similar likeness to the novelist although Rodin never saw him in person. Rodin had clothes resembling those of the Balzac's made by the writer's former tailor, using a cloak similar to Balzac's writing cloak for his final statue. The studies ranged from portrait to muscular and elderly nude figures along with humorous and distorted representations with sexual emphasis. Rodin repeatedly studied the cloak as well as different facial features that he derived from his observational studies and limited references including a daguerreotype of Balzac. Each sketch evolved and transformed into a different representation of the novelist varying from phallic nudes to heavily clothed and hidden figures. In 1894, the Societ√© threatened to step in legally with the commission, turn the job over to artist Alexandre Falgui√®re and take away Rodin's payment. Yet Rodin continued to ask for extensions on time making over fifty studies and continuously distanced himself from a true physical portrayal, tending towards a more psychological representation. The artist became infatuated with capturing the essence of the author's strength. In a message to writer Charles Chincholle in May, 1898, Rodin explained his artistic pursuit: \\"The only thing I realize today is that the neck is too strong. I thought I had to enlarge it because according to me, modern sculpture must exaggerate the forms from the moral point of view. Through the exaggerated neck I wanted to represent strength I realize that the execution exceeded the idea.\\" Final study The Final Study for the Monument to Balzac is a smaller version study for the final statue. Rejection Monument to Balzac photographed by Edward Steichen, 1911 Monument to Balzac in Paris by Auguste Rodin Finally in 1898, Rodin presented a plaster study of the Balzac statue in the Salon de la Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. The sculpture was not received well by the critics; Rodin took the negativity as a personal attack. Many disliked the grotesque stature of the figure while others criticized the work to be very similar to that of the Italian impressionist Medardo Rosso. As well, reports surfaced before the unveiling of the sculpture regarding anticipated dismay over the final outcome of the artwork. The Soci√©t√© des Gens de Lettres decided to disregard the commission to Rodin and not accept the sculpture. Regardless of rejection from his commissionaires, contemporaries such as Paul C√©zanne, Toulouse-Lautrec and Claude Monet supported Rodin in his point of view. A backlash against the rejection along with a petition signed by supporters in the artistic community proceeded, yet in the end, Rodin decidedly declined any bids for the work and placed the plaster artwork in his home at Meudon.

Jefferson declares that the British Parliament did not have the right to govern the Thirteen Colonies. He argues that since the individual colonies were founded they were independent of British rule. Jefferson, in this work, held that allodial title, not feudal title, was held to American lands, and thus the people did not owe fees and rents for that land to the British crown. Despite being a life-long slave owner, Jefferson included a strong condemnation of slavery in the tract, writing \\"The abolition of domestic slavery is the great object of desire in those colonies, where it was unhappily introduced in their infant state. But previous to the enfranchisement of the slaves we have, it is necessary to exclude all further importations from Africa; yet our repeated attempts to effect this by prohibitions, and by imposing duties which might amount to a prohibition, have been hitherto defeated by his majesty's negative: Thus preferring the immediate advantages of a few African corsairs to the lasting interests of the American states, and to the rights of human nature, deeply wounded by this infamous practice.\\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/jeffsumm.asp The work was presented to, and debated by, the First Continental Congress. When this took place, Jefferson did not attend. Despite his attempts, Congress agreed to a more moderate decision than Jefferson's proposed concept. Despite not being able to completely convince Congress, friends of Jefferson printed the Summary in a pamphlet form. It was distributed throughout London, New York and Philadelphia.

Proprietors may enforce restrictions by technical means, such as by restricting source code access, firmware replacement restrictions (by denying complete tooling that may be necessary in order to recompile and replace the firmware), or by legal means, such as through copyright and patents. Proprietary firmware may range from just a few kilobytes of microcode for a network interface controller to megabytes of binaries for a wireless router. Custom firmware may still be available for certain products, which is often free and open-source software, and is especially popular in certain segments of hardware like gaming consoles, wireless routers and Android phones, which are capable of running complete general-purpose operating systems like GNU/Linux, FreeBSD or NetBSD, which are often the systems used by the manufacturer in their original proprietary firmware. Difficult to avoid Proprietary firmware (and especially the microcode) is much more difficult to avoid than proprietary software or even proprietary device drivers, because the firmware is usually very specific to the manufacturer of each device (often being unique for each model), and the programming documentation and complete specifications that would be necessary to create a replacement are often withheld by the hardware manufacturer. One potential solution is going with open-source hardware, which goes a step further by also providing schematics for replicating the hardware itself. Even though both proprietary firmware and proprietary device drivers are shipped in binary form, to be practical, the branding \\"binary blobs\\" is used only for the binary drivers. Distribution issues Many open-source operating systems reluctantly have to include proprietary firmware files in their distributions simply to make their device drivers work, because manufacturers try to save money by removing flash memory or EEPROM from their devices, requiring the operating system to upload the firmware each time the device is used. However, in order to do so, the operating system still has to have distribution rights for this proprietary microcode. If such distributions rights are not obtained, then the device will not work; this especially presents a chicken-and-egg issue with wireless network interface controllers from certain short-sighted manufacturers like Intel, which cannot be used until such files are somehow obtained first, which is difficult to accomplish when the wireless card doesn't work. Security concerns Proprietary firmware poses a significant security risk to the user, because of the direct memory access (DMA) architecture of modern computers, and the potential for DMA attacks. Theo de Raadt of OpenBSD suggests that wireless firmware are kept proprietary because of poor design quality, as well as firmware defects. Mark Shuttleworth of Ubuntu suggests that \\"it's reasonable to assume that all firmware is a cesspool of insecurity courtesy of incompetence of the worst degree from manufacturers, and competence of the highest degree from a very wide range of such agencies\\". However, the security and quality/reliability risks posed by proprietary microcode may be lower than those posed by proprietary device drivers, because the microcode in this context isn't linked against the operating system, and doesn't run on the host's main processor.

It is the traditional indigenous form of governance in the both Samoas, comprising American Samoa and the Independent State of Samoa. The term comprises the prefix fa'a (Samoan for \\"in the way of\\") and the word matai (family name or title). Of central importance in the system are the matai, the holders of family chief titles, and their role in looking after their family. Fa'amatai is the key socio-political system of governance and way of life (fa'a Samoa) in Samoan culture. Inherent in the fa'amatai system is the welfare and well-being of the extended family ('aiga) and the protection of family property, consisting most importantly of customary land. At the apex of this system are the four major title holders ‚Äì Tupua Tamasese, Malietoa, Mata'afa, Tuimaleali'ifano - known as the Tama-a-Aiga ('sons of the families') that afford them leadership over the royal families of Samoa. All heads of state of Samoa have been one of the four title holders. In addition, these four paramount chiefs are often accorded pƒÅpƒÅ titles - titles that indicate sovereignty or leadership over a designated territory or kinship network. These titles are Tui Atua, Tui A'ana, Gatoaitele and Vaetamasoalii. The Tui Atua is currently held by Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Efi, former Prime Minister and Head of State of Samoa. The Gatoaitele title is currently held by Savea Sano Malifa, a respected journalist and owner of the Samoa Observer Newspaper. There are no official holders of the other two pƒÅpƒÅ titles. In the 49-seat Legislative Assembly of Samoa, all 47 Samoan members are also matai, performing dual roles as chiefs and modern politicians, with the exception of the two seats reserved for non-Samoans. The 2011 census of Samoa identified 16,787 matai out of a total population of 187,820 (8.9%); 15,021 (89.5%) were male and 1,766 (10.5%) were female. The fa'amatai system is significant in modern Samoa where most of the land, about 81% (567,000 acres), is under customary ownership with the rest under the national government (malo) as public lands with another 4% freehold. Former system of government Two great families comprise what may be termed the aristocracy of Samoa: Sa Malietoa, and Sa Tupua. For a great length of time, the title of Tupu (Sovereign) was confined to members of the latter since the reign of Queen Salamasina. On the death of the Safe-o-fafine, the last king in the Sa Tupua line, the title remained in abeyance for a long time, as the line of succession was broken after Atua's defeat in war and the seat of power moved from Lufilufi to its new seat in Manono. The new malo was led by the Manono high chief Lei'ataua Lelologa, His son Tamafaiga, succeeded him and assumed the attributes of a god as well as those of a king. He was actually worshipped as a god and developed into a tyrant. In the hope of escaping from his tyranny, the people of A'ana conferred their title of Tui A'ana upon him, but only to further smart under his oppressive rule. Whereas the Tonumaipe'a clan had earlier taken all the royal titles and left the districts to run their own affairs, the reverse happened in Manono's case. The Manono/Tonumaipe'a party ignored the royal titles but took the malo (executive power). This was a political move, as claiming the Tafa'ifa was irrelevant to the substance of power and would only validate his defeated foes' traditional authority to distribute patronage. And so for the first time for many generations, the dignity passed from the family of Fonoti and thus from the line of the ancient Queen Salamasina. A'ana not only lost the prestige it had so long held in this connection but the royal residence no longer was situated in the province, the new king continuing to reside on Manono. As his tyranny increased, in like proportion increased the hatred of the people of A'ana, and at length they rose against him and he was killed in 1829. T his was just before John Williams, whose name is a shining light in the annals of missionary enterprise, visited Samoa for the first time. A bloody war ensued and A'ana's power was broken and the district laid waste. Governance Lepea village with round meeting houses where matai meetings take place and open commons area (malae) for outdoor ceremonies. Samoa's chiefly system revolves around family and extended clans of kinship (aiga), based on the culture's communal and extended family relationships. The term aiga includes not only the immediate family (father, mother and children), but also the whole union of families of a clan and even those who although not related are subject to the family control. At the local level, much of the country's civil and criminal matters are dealt with by some 360 village chief councils, Fono o Matai, according to traditional law, a practice further strengthened by the 1990 Village Fono Law. Most Samoans live in villages consisting of groups of families with close ties and history. The influence of the matai is felt not only in the village but also in the district and even beyond. The active factor in the life of the village is the village council or fono o matai and its members are the matai. The fono of matai is the executive and judicial authority of every village in Samoa. If a matter is of importance the assembly is held on the malae, the open space in front of the village. The speakers address the assembly and stand to do so. The listeners are comfortably seated on mats. Those not taking part in these assemblies are described as tagatanu'u (people of the village) and include untitled men, women and children. Democratic ideas do not prevail at these fonos and decisions are independent of majority or minority rule. The decision of one or more matai sili (senior matai) is decisive. The remainder who are merely at the fono to listen, agree with the decisions given. It is permissible for the minor matai to discuss the matter with and endeavour to try to influence the matai sili before the fono commences. Before the fono commences preliminary councils are held (taupulega) by the different groups and at these councils the single family heads exchange opinions and endeavour to convince each other and to create harmony in order that when the actual fono eventuates everything will move smoothly. Some matai are permitted to speak at these fono without having any right to make a decision. The 2006 census of Samoa also revealed that 96% of the country's matai were actively involved in village activities as part of their matai responsibilities. The 4% 'not active' was explained as possibly due to the matai holding more than one title or living away from the village where their title belonged. Authority The authority of the matai has some limits. They are called upon to discuss all important matters with everyone of significance belonging to the family union. If the matter is of minor importance and only of interest to the immediate village family, more distant relations may be omitted from discussion. Matai subject to a senior matai (matai sili) are independent in family matters concerning their own single family unless they have a tuaigoa shared title name only, in which case they are not referred to at all in family matters and may be deprived of their names at the will of their superior at any time. Modern politics Government Building in the capital Apia housing administrative ministerial offices. The fa'amatai system is entrenched in Samoan politics. From the country's independence in 1962, only matai could vote and stand as candidates in elections to parliament. In 1990, the voting system was changed by the Electoral Amendment Act which introduced universal suffrage and the right to vote for adults aged 21-years and over. However, the right to stand for elections remains with matai, who are themselves selected by consensus of their families, including non-matai family members. Therefore, every Samoan Member of Parliament is also a matai, performing dual roles as a 'chief' as well as duties in the Samoan parliament. This applies to most Samoans in positions of public responsibility from the Prime Minister of Samoa to the country's Head of State, who is referred to as O le Ao o le Malo (the chieftain of the government). Colonial influences As matai head their families and represent their villages, communities and districts, important high-ranking title-holders came to play significant roles in colonial politics with the advent of western powers and rivalry in the 19th century. The colonial era saw Britain, Germany and the United States supporting different matai (such as Mata'afa Iosefo and the youthful Malietoa Tanumafili I) in order to gain political influence in Samoa. This led to the colonial powers bestowing the European title of king upon their own candidate during the tumultuous years of the late 19th century, leading to warring among competing high-ranking matai in different districts. The Samoan term tupu, referring to paramount status over a particular region or the entire island group, has sometimes been translated incorrectly to the English language as \\"king\\" in the European sense. The relatively brief usage of the term \\"king\\" died out with the end of colonialism. In the early 20th century, matai leadership played a pivotal role in the pro-independence Mau movement which eventually led to Western Samoa's independence in 1962. Matai title High chief Seumanutafa Pogai of Apia, circa 1890‚Äì1910. (photo by Thomas Andrew) Each matai has a name () by and through which they exercise their rights in the family over which they preside. Matai names are for the most part very old ones and are handed down from generation to generation. Matai titles can be bestowed on one person or numerous family members who are distinguished from each other by their Christian name. It is common for each 'aiga to have a number of matai titles, but one particular title will be the most important and serve as the main matai title. The title of a family matai which is peculiar and particular to that family is the subject of tradition and is faithfully recorded by the family and passed on from generation to generation. It sometimes happens that new names are for some reason taken and the old ones discarded or passed on to lesser or junior chiefs. In Samoan culture, the concept of serving and taking on the responsibility for the welfare of the family is integral to the fa'amatai system. Various members of the family are called upon in turn to support their matai in carrying out their role and responsibilities according to Samoan tradition, cultural obligations and duty. This often involves the family contributing money and important cultural items such as ie toga (fine mats) as well as food which the matai presents on behalf of the aiga to ensure the family's obligations are met in their village or wider community. Men and women have equal rights to matai titles in Samoa, although the role of women in Samoan society means female matai comprise a relatively small percentage. Before the advent of European contact and influence, the authority (pule) of the matai extended to life and limb but this power has been altered and absorbed by a Western-style modern government (referred to as the malo) where the matai's authority is confined and balanced against the national governance.

The round tanoa (or laulau) vessel represents the 'ava ceremony, central to Samoan traditions. There are two different ranks within the Samoan chief system. There is the 'high' or 'sacred' chief known as the Ali‚Äôi and 'orator' Chief known as Tulafale and is a system found in every district throughout Samoa. In some places, there is also the Tulafale-alii, a chief of high rank who, owing to their status and antiquity, carry the dual functions of orator-chief. These are also referred to as 'matua' (elder), most notable of which are the Fuataga and Tafua of Aleipata, Moeono and 'Iuli of Falefa, Tofua'iofo'ia and Talo of Falealili, Te'o and Maugatai of Safata. In former times the term matai applied only to tulafale, but over time the term has become applied to ali'i generally. The wife of an ali'i is referred to as faletua. The wife of a tulafale (orator status matai) is referred to as tausi. Central to Samoan culture is the recording of history and genealogy which was achieved through oral history before the introduction of a written language. Orator chiefs (tulafale) and speakers (failauga ‚Äì 'speech-maker') are terms used for Samoans holding the position of speakers or mouthpieces of chiefs and they are found in all villages. Important matai titles are also tied to certain orator matai titles. Orators serve the means of conveying the wishes of chiefs to the people or speaking on behalf of the family, village or district on important occasions. The orator is the recorder of family histories and pedigree (fa'alupega), genealogies (gafa) and events and is indispensable at public ceremonies. The power balance this system carries is often depicted in cultural and social settings. Ali‚Äôi are known to not to say much during these meetings as the Tulafale are the traditional mouthpiece tasked with interpreting the will of the Ali'i. In doing so, tulafale have over the centuries become a powerful group, able to utilise their speaking platform to wield considerable influence over the aiga, the village and in their dealings with other aiga and districts. This led to the rise of the Tumua ma Pule institution, the influential group of orators from both Savaii and Upolu. The orators of Leulumoega and Lufilufi have wielded considerable power over the centuries as it is only through their consent that the royal ali'i title of Tui A'ana and Tui Atua titles could be bestowed. Men and women both have equal rights to the matai title. The Chiefs are responsible for their village/family, whenever needed, they must be there to support them. (Fa‚Äôalavelave) . Samoan gafa (pedigree, ancestors, descent) is central to family kinship and will usually commence from the person who first brought the name into prominence and caused it to be respected. It does not necessarily mean that the family commenced from the institution of a name or that the individual holding the title was the founder of the family. Former matai of the family have by comparison become unimportant and their names have fallen into disuse or become uninfluential.  Fine mats: 'Ie Toga  There are many Samoan public events at which the distribution of mats will take place. Many of these mats, particularly the fine mats ('ie toga), are valued very highly both from a monetary point of view and also from a historical and sentimental viewpoint. The more important mats bear respected names. The most noteworthy occasions on which mats are presented are marriages, births and deaths and the bestowal of a chiefly title. Customary land View in Safune village. Apolima Tai village in Apolima Island (1890‚Äì1910). The matai of the family is the administrator and representative of the family property which includes customary land. Most of the population in Samoa, 65% overall, live with their families in villages on customary land. However, the 2006 Samoa census showed that 34 out of 48 political districts had more than 80% of households living on customary land with the lowest figures (25%) in the more densely concentrated urbanised area around the capital Apia. On the island of Savai'i, where there are fewer people and fewer signs of western material culture, 93% of the 43,142 population live on customary land. Looking after the collective family land is one of the most important responsibilities of Samoan families and their matai. A matai may make their wishes known and bequeath certain property to others such as a married daughter, but they cannot transfer land rights beyond their own. Under the management of one or more matai the lands are divided amongst the various families for their own use and are viewed by these family members as their unassailable rights. A Samoan proverb highlighting the importance of land in Samoa reads, E le soifua umi le tagata fa'atau fanua (The man who sells family land will not live to an old age ‚Äì devils will bring about his early death). With most of the country's land under customary ownership, the position of the matai is significant in modern- day politics in Samoa in terms of the nation's economic development, conservation, sustainability, tourism, national infrastructure and access to natural resources such as water, forestry, road access, agriculture and farming. An example in recent years is the matai from the village of Sili on the island of Savai'i turning down a government proposal to build a hydroelectric plant on village land because of environmental concerns. In contrast, the matai in Sasina have agreed with government support to an unprecedented 120-year lease of prime oceanfront land to an American company to build a tourism resort estimated to cost US$450‚Äì500 million. In conservation, the villages of Uafato in the Va'a-o-Fonoti district at the east end of Upolu island and Falealupo at the west end of Savai'i have agreed to conservation covenants for their native forests. Much of the land under the government today was alienated or sold during colonialism and later came under the Samoa government when the colonial era ended. This includes large tracts of plantation land from the 19th century as well as later periods of colonial administration including German Samoa (1900‚Äì1914) followed by the New Zealand administration. This has resulted in ongoing court cases for land claims between matai and the government, such as that of the village of Satapuala over land by Faleolo International Airport, disputes which directly impact upon the country's national infrastructure. Matai selection Samoan women preparing 'ava, 1909 In effect, every Samoan, men and women, is an heir to a matai title pertaining to their kinship and ancestry. However, matai titles are not automatically passed from a matai to their children or direct descendants but are bestowed upon those whom the extended family agree will best serve their needs while also ensuring that different branches of the family are represented. A recent example of this Samoan custom and law is the stripping of the important Malietoa title from the son of the previous title holder, the late Head of State, Malietoa Tanumafili II (1913‚Äì2007). Following Malietoa Tanumafili II's death in 2007, one branch of the family bestowed the title upon his son Papali'i Fa'amausili Moli in the village of Malie. The other branches of the family filed petitions at the Samoa Land and Titles Court claiming the bestowal invalid in breach of Samoan law. In June 2008, the court agreed and ruled the bestowal of the Malietoa title upon the son illegal, highlighting the unique nature of matai selection based on consensus, merit, custom and due process rather than automatic hereditary selection. Other cultural factors can also play a part in the complex decision making process including seniority in age (an important factor in Samoan society), leadership qualities, oratory and an individual's ability to contribute to the family's overall circumstances and well-being. Title bestowal Matai titles (, literally \\"formal name\\") are bestowed upon family members during a cultural ceremony called a saofa'i which occurs only after discussion and consensus within the family. The saofa'i is a solemn ceremony which marks the formal acceptance of a new matai by their family and village into the circle of chiefs and orators. It involves the gathering of chiefs and orators in a fale tele meeting house, the exchanging of oratory speeches, the reciting of genealogies and a kava ceremony followed by a feast provided by the new matai's family. Architecture of Samoa dictates seating positions inside the meeting house during the title bestowal including the position of those making the kava being situated at the rear. Once the ceremony is completed, the new matai is henceforth called by their new name. In New Zealand, more people born in Samoa than any other foreign country officially change their names with the Department of Internal Affairs and it is believed that many of these are adding matai titles. Non-Samoans Matai titles are sometimes conferred upon non-Samoans as an honour by Samoan families and their villages. An example is the title of Seiuli conferred in 1993 by Samoa's Head of State, Malietoa Tanumafili II upon Barry Curtis, at the time Mayor of Manukau, a New Zealand city with a large Samoan population. Other non-Samoan New Zealanders bestowed with matai titles include prime ministers Robert Muldoon, David Lange and Jim Bolger, politician Winston Peters and Auckland businessman Dick Hubbard who holds the title Galumalemana. In 1988, American ethnobotanist Paul Alan Cox received the legendary title Nafanua from the village of Falealupo, where Cox had lived for many years and later helped to set up a covenant to protect the native rainforest. Congressional Record: Eni F.H. Faleomavaega In 1978, the Governor-General of Fiji, Ratu Sir George Cakobau was bestowed the title Peseta by Matautu on Savai'i island during his visit to Tui Fiti's sacred ground. Ban Ki-moon was given the title Prince Tupua Ban Ki-moon of Siupapa Saleapaga on 2 September 2014 during the United Nations' Small Island Development Conference while serving as the Secretary General of the United Nations. Naming convention A matai title is always first in naming convention as the most important name for a titled individual. When a person is appointed a matai, they retain their Christian name in addition to their new matai title. The matai title is appended to the beginning of their name so that their Christian name follows their new matai title. As one person may hold a number of different matai names from different branches of their genealogy, the new names are also added before their Christian name, with no set order in terms of general usage. An example is Mata'afa Faumuina Fiame Mulinu'u I whose first three names reveal individual high chief titles and thereby his genealogy and the different villages and families to which he belonged; the Faumuina title from Lepea, the Fiame title from Lotofaga and the Mata'afa title, one of the paramount names in the country. As more than one family member can be bestowed the same matai title, each person's Christian name serves to distinguish them from each other. Dividing a family title so that it is shared among more than one family member is also agreed upon by consensus. The Samoans explain this by saying that a man has a fasi igoa ‚Äì a piece of the title. Usoali'i refers to brother chiefs, those men in the family union holding matai names. They may all enjoy the same rights or be under the control of one matai who is termed sao, in which case the other chiefs are referred to as tuaigoa. Women matai Of Samoa's total population of 187,820 (2011 census), 90,830 were female, comprising 48.4% of the population. The male (51.6%) to female (48.4%) ratio for the country is higher than the world ratio. In 2011, there were 1,766 female matai, 10.5% of the 16,787 matai living in the country. A woman can hold a matai name and have the pule (authority) of the family but this does not often occur. Should she have both she will usually bestow her matai title on one of her family, probably her husband, and retain the pule. In 2006, there were four female Members of Parliament in Samoa and three were cabinet ministers out of a 13-member cabinet. Prominent women matai in Samoa include scholar and historian Aiono Fanaafi Le Tagaloa (matai title Aiono), high chief and senior cabinet minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa (matai title Fiame), politician Safuneitu'uga Pa'aga Neri (matai title Safuneitu'uga) and writer Letuimanu'asina Emma Kruse Va'ai (matai title Letuimanu'asina). With many Samoans also living overseas in other countries, other prominent Samoan female matai includes New Zealand former Member of Parliament Luamanuvao Winnie Laban (matai title Luamanuvao). Old age Seniority in years and old age is a respected status in Samoan society where elders, whether familiars or complete strangers, are referred to as tamƒÅ (father) or tinƒÅ (mother). In this cultural context, a retired matai usually enjoys the respect of their family and is referred to as the faatonutonu folau, the steersperson of the boat. In this case they do not actually do the steering but their advice is listened to and their family profits from their ripe experience. Untitled men Young man dressed as a manaia, the son of a Samoan chief, in ceremonial attire including an elaborate headdress (tuiga), circa 1890‚Äì1910. (photo by Thomas Andrew) The Samoan appellation for a male person who is not a matai is a taule'ale'a. The real meaning of the word, which is derived from the word le'ale'a (immature), is a young man who has not reached maturity. It is nowadays applied to any male person who is not a matai. In the past the term was sometimes used to indicate that any male person, even a matai, was not an old man. In this sense, taule'ale'a signifies young or comparatively young, just as toea'ina is used to signify that a man is aged or elderly (a respectful status in Samoa) whether he be a matai or a taule'ale'a. It is permissible for a taule'ale'a (an untitled man) to change his name as often as he wishes. A chance remark or an outstanding incident will often be the determining factor in naming a taule'ale'a. This can apply to everyone else, including females in Samoa, where a family member, especially a child, might be called a new name to commemorate an important occasion. Disputes resolution Disputes over matai titles which cannot be resolved among family members within the wide extended 'aiga are dealt with by the Samoa Land and Titles Court which consists of cultural and judicial experts appointed by the Supreme Court of Samoa. The Land and Titles Court hears disputes over matai title succession as well as disagreements pertaining to customary land. The court derives from the Native Land and Titles Court put in place under the colonial German administration in 1901. Samoa's political stability is thought to be due in large part to the success of this court in hearing disputes.

Life and career Cantillana's grandmother was a communist and later she practiced the evangelic religion and he grew up under that doctrine until 12 years old in Curic√≥. He used to play the piano in the local church. He studied in the theater academy of Fernando Gonz√°lez. Since 1994 he has participated in theater work such as Historia de la Sangre (1995), Cal√≠gula (1998), Hamlet (2000) and La Herencia (2000). In 1995, Cantillana traveled to the Canadian city of Montreal with the play \\"Historia de la Sangre\\". The following year, 1996, he participated in the same play in Berlin, a city where he would return that same year with the play La misi√≥n. In 1998, the actor would return to Germany to present the same play in Munich, Bonn and Stuttgart. In 1996, Cantillana received the award for best actor for his role in the play Despertar de Primavera, presented in the third Nuevas Tendencias Teatrales festival. He made his debut in the telenovela world in the role of Patricio Tepano in Iorana (1998) from TVN, he then performed some other characters, among them, an AIDS victim, a common employee, a frustrated detective and a young homosexual doctor. Cantillana was nominated for an Altazor Award for his role in the soap opera Roman√© and he won the APES award as the best actor in the year 2000. He had the protagonist role in the TVN soap opera, Coraz√≥n de Mar√≠a (2007), where he plays Miguel. He has one of the mains roles in the HBO series Pr√≥fugos. He also has supporting role in the TVN series Los Archivos del Cardenal. This series tells the ordeals of a group of lawyers than works for Vicaria de la Solidaridad an office within the Catholic Church that investigates crimes by Augusto Pinochet's secret police against left-wing people. He acted in the movie Radio Coraz√≥n (the sequel to El Chacotero Sentimental), with Claudia Di Gir√≥lamo, Tamara Acosta and Manuela Martelli, under director Roberto Artiagoit√≠a (El Rumpy) and with screenwriter Pablo Illanes. The argument represents the personal relations among family members and combines various elements, principally comedy, with some romance and drama aspects.

Hodder & Stoughton) A Horseman Riding By is a 1966 novel sequence by R. F. Delderfield that starts in 1902 at the tail end of the Boer War and is continued in the sequel to end in the summer of 1965. It is set in Devon in the early 20th century. It was to some extent an elegy for the traditional society which was blown apart by the First World War. Delderfield wrote at least one sequel: some accounts describe it as part of a trilogy, but this may be due to confusion because it was published in two parts in the USA. After a three-part radio adaptation broadcast on the BBC Home Service and BBC Radio 4 in 1967, starring William Lucas, Josephine Tewson and Hilda Schroder, the first part of the novel and the World War I portion of the second were dramatised as a BBC 13-part television serial, starring Nigel Havers, Prunella Ransome and Glyn Houston, broadcast on Sunday evenings from 24 September 1978. The series was never repeated on any BBC channel, but was released on DVD in 2004. The BBC did not adapt the remainder of the series of novels, but a few years later they adapted two more of Delderfield's novels, To Serve Them All My Days and Diana. Long Summer Day The first novel is Long Summer Day. The novels are all set in south Devon, where the main character, Paul Craddock buys an estate after serving with the Imperial Yeomanry in the Boer War. The first novel covers the years of the long \\"Edwardian afternoon\\" after the death of Queen Victoria, including the postponement of the coronation of King Edward VII, the Liberal landslide of 1906 and the coronation of King George V. The story follows the trials and tribulations of Craddock, and later his second wife and their growing family. Post of Honour The second novel Post of Honour covers the years from 1914 through to May 1940 with the Dunkirk evacuation. However the first chapter catches up with the main characters and events from 1911 to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. The second novel finishes with the \\"Miracle of Dunkirk\\" with Craddock's eldest son Simon (his son from his brief first marriage) returning safely from France. The Green Gauntlet The third and final novel The Green Gauntlet is in two sections. Part one picks up the story of the Craddock family in February 1942 and runs through the rest of the Second World War to the culmination of the D Day landings. The story then takes us on to the end of the war just before V.E. Day. Part two gets underway with the V.E. Day celebrations in May 1945, then follows the Craddock family fortunes through the 1950s and up until the funeral of Sir Winston Churchill in 1965. A Horseman Riding By - BBC TV Adaptation In 1978, a 13-part television adaptation was broadcast Sunday evenings on BBC1 at 7:15pm. It was produced by Ken Riddington. Part of the filming was undertaken at Bowringsleigh, a Grade 1 listed Elizabethan house in West Alvington, Devon, England. Main cast: Nigel Havers, Glyn Houston, Madge Ryan, Pam St Clement, Glyn Owen, Alan Browning, William Moore, Milton Johns, Margaret John, Steve Hodson, Olaf Pooley, Prunella Ransome, David Prowse, Gillian McCutcheon and Fiona Gaunt.

There are seven major classes of nutrients: carbohydrates, fats, fibre, minerals, proteins, vitamins, and water. Constituents of diet Macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built) and energy. Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally, though the net energy depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance. Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class dietary material, fiber (i.e., non-digestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, though the exact reasons remain unclear. Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex polysaccharides (starch). Fats are triglycerides, made of assorted fatty acid monomers bound to glycerol backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are essential in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing amino acids. Essential amino acids cannot be made by the animal. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs normally only during prolonged starvation. Other dietary substances found in plant foods (phytochemicals, polyphenols) are not identified as essential nutrients but appear to impact health in both positive and negative ways. Most foods contain a mix of some or all of the nutrient classes, together with other substances. Some nutrients can be stored internally (e.g., the fat soluble vitamins), while others are required more or less continuously. Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients or, in extreme cases, too much of a required nutrient. For example, both salt provides sodium and chloride, both essential nutrients, but will cause illness or even death in too large amounts. Dietary fibre is a carbohydrate (polysaccharide or oligosaccharide) that is incompletely absorbed in some animals. Protein Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes which control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each molecule is composed of amino acids which are characterized by the inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulfur. The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are essential (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are non-essential (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A few amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called gluconeogenesis; this is done in quantity only during starvation. Minerals Dietary minerals are the chemical elements required by living organisms, other than the four elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen that are present in nearly all organic molecules. The term \\"mineral\\" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Many elements are essential in relative quantity; they are usually called \\"bulk minerals\\". Some are structural, but many play a role as electrolytes. These include: * Calcium, a common electrolyte, but also needed structurally structural (for muscle and digestive system health, bones, some forms neutralizes acidity, may help clear toxins, and provide signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions) * Chlorine as chloride ions; very common electrolyte * Magnesium, required for processing ATP and related reactions (builds bone, causes strong peristalsis, increases flexibility, increases alkalinity) * Phosphorus, required component of bones; essential for energy processing * Potassium, a very common electrolyte (heart and nerve health) * Sodium, a very common electrolyte * Sulfur for three amino acids and therefore many proteins (skin, hair, nails, liver, and pancreas) Many elements are required in trace amounts, usually because they play a catalytic role in enzymes. Vitamins Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions. Excess of some vitamins is also dangerous to health (notably vitamin A), and animal nutrition researchers have managed to establish safe levels for some common companion animals.Morris PJ, Salt C, Raila J, Brenten T, Kohn B, Schweigert FJ, Zentek J. Safety evaluation of vitamin A in growing dogs. British Journal of Nutrition. 2012; 108(10):1800-1809. Deficiency or excess of minerals can also have serious health consequences. ASH Though not a nutrient as such, an entry for ash is sometimes found on nutrition labels, especially for pet food. This entry measures the weight of inorganic material left over after the food is burned for two hours at 600 ¬∞C. Thus, it does not include water, fibre, and nutrients that provide calories, but it does include some nutrients, such as minerals Purina; The Facts About Dietary Ash ; last checked 2009-07-22 Too much ash may contribute to feline urological syndrome in domestic cats.R.

Accessed April 19, 2014 in an unambiguous way. ArchiMate is a technical standard from The Open Group and is based on the concepts of the IEEE 1471 standard. It is supported by various tool vendors and consulting firms. ArchiMate is also a registered trademark of The Open Group. The Open Group has a certification program for ArchiMate users, software tools and courses.ArchiMate Certification at opengroup.org. Accessed January 11, 2014. ArchiMate distinguishes itself from other languages such as Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) by its enterprise modelling scope.Pallab Saha (2008) Advances in Government Enterprise Architecture. p.39. Also, UML and BPMN are meant for a specific use and they are quite heavy ‚Äì containing about 150 (UML) and 250 (BPMN) modeling concepts whereas ArchiMate works with just about 50 (in version 2.0). The goal of ArchiMate is to be ‚Äùas small as possible‚Äù, not to cover every edge scenario imaginable. To be easy to learn and apply, ArchiMate was intentionally restricted ‚Äúto the concepts that suffice for modeling the proverbial 80% of practical cases\\".  Overview  ArchiMate offers a common language for describing the construction and operation of business processes, organizational structures, information flows, IT systems, and technical infrastructure. This insight helps the different stakeholders to design, assess, and communicate the consequences of decisions and changes within and between these business domains. The main concepts and relationships of the ArchiMate language can be seen as a framework, the so-called Archimate Framework: The ArchiMate Framework, in: ArchiMate¬Æ 2.1. Accessed 06.2015. It divides the enterprise architecture into a business, application and technology layer. In each layer, three aspects are considered: active elements, an internal structure and elements that define use or communicate information. One of the objectives of the ArchiMate language is to define the relationships between concepts in different architecture domains. The concepts of this language therefore hold the middle between the detailed concepts, which are used for modeling individual domains (for example, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for modeling software products),Zoran Stojanoviƒá et al. (2007). Service-oriented Software System Engineering. p.145-146. and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), which is used for business process modeling.  History  ArchiMate is partly based on the IEEE 1471 standard. It was developed in the Netherlands by a project team from the Telematica Instituut in cooperation with several Dutch partners from government, industry and academia. Among the partners were Ordina, Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen, the Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) and the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI). Later, tests were performed in organizations such as ABN AMRO, the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration and the ABP.Telematica Instituut (2006) Annual Report 2005. p.7. Accessed 18 jan 2009. The development process lasted from July 2002 to December 2004, and took about 35 person years and approximately 4 million euros. The development was funded by the Dutch government (Dutch Tax and Customs Administration), and business partners, including ABN AMRO and the ABP Pension Fund.ArchiMate : Its Time Has Come? Enterprise Architecture Demystified. Posted by snair007 on August 3, 2008 In 2008 the ownership and stewardship of ArchiMate was transferred to The Open Group. It is now managed by the ArchiMate Forum within The Open Group. In February 2009 The Open Group published the ArchiMate¬Æ 1.0 standard as a formal technical standard. In January 2012 the ArchiMate¬Æ 2.0 standard, and in 2013 the ArchiMate¬Æ 2.1 standardThe Open Group (2012), ArchiMate 2.1 Specification was released. In June 2016, the Open Group released version 3.0 of the ArchiMate Specification.ArchiMate v3.0 Specification Accessed 27 June 2016. The latest update of the Archimate is 3.0.1 that came out in August 2017. Version 3.0 adds enhanced support for capability-oriented strategic modelling, new entities representing physical resources (for modelling the ingredients, equipment and transport resources used in the physical world) and a generic metamodel showing the entity types and the relationships between them.  ArchiMate Framework = Core Framework  ArchiMate Core Framework. The main concepts and elements of the ArchiMate language are being presented as ArchiMate Core Framework. It consists of three layers and three aspects. This creates a matrix of combinations. Every layer has its Passive structure, Behavior and Active structure aspects. = Layers = ArchiMate has a layered and service-oriented look on architectural models. The higher layers make use of services that are provided by the lower layers. Although, at an abstract level, the concepts that are used within each layer are similar, we define more concrete concepts that are specific for a certain layer. In this context, we distinguish three main layers: * The Business layer is about business processes, services, functions and events of business units. This layer \\"offers products and services to external customers, which are realized in the organization by business processes performed by business actors and roles\\". * The Application layer is about software applications that \\"support the components in the business with application services\\". * The Technology layer deals \\"with the hardware and communication infrastructure to support the Application Layer. This layer offers infrastructural services needed to run applications, realized by computer and communication hardware and system software\\". Each of these main layers can be further divided in sub-layers. For example, in the Business layer, the primary business processes realising the products of a company may make use of a layer of secondary (supporting) business processes; in the Application layer, the end-user applications may make use of generic services offered by supporting applications. On top of the Business layer, a separate Environment layer may be added, modelling the external customers that make use of the services of the organisation (although these may also be considered part of the Business layer). In line with service orientation, the most important relation between layers is formed by use relations, which show how the higher layers make use of the services of lower layers. However, a second type of link is formed by realisation relations: elements in lower layers may realise comparable elements in higher layers; e.g., a ‚Äòdata object‚Äô (Application layer) may realise a ‚Äòbusiness object‚Äô (Business layer); or an ‚Äòartifact‚Äô (Technology layer) may realise either a ‚Äòdata object‚Äô or an ‚Äòapplication component‚Äô (Application layer). = Aspects = * Passive structure is the set of entities on which actions are conducted. In the Business Layer the example would be information objects, in the Application Layer data objects and in the Technology Layer, they could include physical objects. * Behavior refers to the processes and functions performed by the actors. \\"Structural elements are assigned to behavioral elements, to show who or what displays the behavior\\". * Active Structure is the set of entities that display some behavior, e.g. business actors, devices, or application components.  Full Framework  ArchiMate Full Framework The Full ArchiMate framework is enriched by the Physical Layer, which was added to allow modeling of ‚Äúphysical equipment, materials, and distribution networks‚Äù and was not present in the previous version. The Implementation and Migration Layer adds elements that allow architects to model a state of transition, to mark parts of the architecture that are temporary for the purpose, as the name says, of implementation and migration. Strategy Layer adds three elements: Resource, Capability and Course of Action. These elements help to incorporate strategic dimension to the ArchiMate language by allowing it to depict the usage of resources and capabilities in order to achieve some strategic goals. Finally, there is a Motivation Aspect that allows different stakeholders to describe the motivation of specific actors or domains, which can be quite important when looking at one thing from several different angles. It adds several elements like stakeholder, value, driver, goal, meaning etc.  Archimate Language  The ArchiMate language is formed as a top-level and is hierarchical. On the top, there is a model. A model is collection of concepts. A Concept can be either an Element or a Relationship. Element can be either of Behavior type, Structure, Motivation or so-called Composite Element (which means that it does not fit just one aspect of the framework, but two or more). The functionality of all the concepts without dependency on the specific layer is described by Generic metamodel. This layer non-specific description of concepts is useful when trying to understand mechanics of the Archimate language.  Concepts  Elements = The generic elements are distributed into the same categories as the layers: * Active structure elements * Behavior elements * Passive structure elements * Motivation elements As described earlier in the Layers section, active structure element represents an entity that is capable of performing behavior. Based on two levels of abstraction that ArchiMate provides, it is possible to distinguish between internal active structure elements, which stands for active elements within the system like f.e. business actors and external active structure elements which stands for elements that carry out the behavior outside the system - f.e. interfaces. Behavior elements can be internal or external as well. Internal behavior element is the one that stands for an activity carried out by some active structure elements within the system. Archimate defines f.e. Process and Function elements. External behavior a service that the whole system provides to the environment. Passive structure element is an object, that can be used by the behavior elements (and thus active structure elements can perform behavior on them). They usually stand for information objects in the business layer and data objects in the application layer, but they may also be used to represent physical objects. As described in the previous chapter, Motivation elements are answering the question Why?, they are trying to give a context and explain the motives behind the architecture. They can be of an active structure, as a Stakeholder and also of a passive structure - Value, Meaning, Driver, etc. = Relationships= ArchiMate sets several types of relationships that can connect different sets of source and target concepts. The classification of relationships is following: * Structural relationships ‚Äì create a static construction of concepts of the same or different types * Dependency relationships ‚Äì define how elements can support other elements * Dynamic relationships ‚Äì model behavioral dependencies * Other relationships  General structure of models within the different layers  Core concepts of the ArchiMate language (Lankhorst, 2013). The general structure of models within the different layers is similar. The same types of concepts and relations are used, although their exact nature and granularity differ. First, it is necessary to distinguish the structural or static aspect and the behavioural or dynamic aspect. Behavioural concepts are assigned to structural concepts, to show who or what displays the behaviour. For example, role, interface and collaboration are assigned to business process, organisational service and business interaction, respectively. Second, there must be a distinction between an external view and an internal view on systems. When looking at the behavioral aspect, these views reflect the principles of service orientation. The service concept represents a unit of essential functionality that a system exposes to its environment. For the external users, only this external functionality, together with non-functional aspects such as the quality of service, costs etc., are relevant. Services are accessible through interfaces, which constitute the external view on the structural aspect. Although for the external users only the external view is relevant, the design of organisations or systems and their internal operations and management also requires knowledge about the internal realisation of the services and interfaces. For this realisation, it is necessary to make a distinction between behavior that is performed by an individual structural element (e.g., actor, role component, etc.), or collective behavior (interaction) that is performed by a collaboration of multiple structural elements.  Notation  The ArchiMate separates the languages concepts from their notation (contrary to the UML or BPMN). As there are different groups of stakeholders, they may need different notations. This might be confusing, but it is solved by the viewpoint mechanism. Although ArchiMate doesn't stress the only one notation, it comes with one and it aims to those \\"used to existing technical modeling techniques such as ERD, UML, or BPMN, and therefore resembles them\\". = Use of colors = In ArchiMate, the use of colors is not explicitly set, however, it is usual that colors are used to distinguish between the different layers. * Yellow for the Business Layer * Blue for the Application Layer * Green for the Technology Layer = Letters = As another way to distinguish to which layer which element belongs, according to the Full Framework layers, there can also be a capital letter in the left top corner of the element that stands for the specific layer (M for the Motivation, B for the Business, etc.) = Element shape = The shape of elements helps to distinguish the right Aspect. Structure elements have square corners, Behavior elements come with round corners. Diagonal corners indicate a motivational element.  Viewpoints  A great premise of the latest version of ArchiMate are the Views and Viewpoints. They allow stakeholders to define specific conditions like concepts, analysis techniques, models, and visualizations ‚Äì a viewpoint, from which the model should be perceived. A view (or a view model) ‚Äúis defined as a part of an Architecture Description that addresses a set of related concerns and is tailored for specific stakeholders‚Äù. In return, the stakeholders give their feedback which creates a bi-directional communication. Ultimately, this allows the stakeholders/architects to communicate their ideas and concerns easily with others. Also by reducing the ‚Äúview‚Äù by setting the right conditions and intentionally limiting the perspective, it is easier solve specific problems and also, for stakeholders from specific areas it makes the model easier to read.  Benefits and pitfalls of ArchiMate = Benefits  * Ensures consistency across all architecture models (business domains) * Allows the stakeholders to be involved in design, to assess all the requirements and it works well as a communication tool * Richness of the tool ‚Äì core framework, motivation extension that enriches the core with reasons why and implementation and migration extension * It is regularly updated with quite broad base of certified users * 3.0.1 version supports IOT features * It provides user with viewpoints  Pitfalls  * Some of the concepts are more useful than others, and some of them have been found confusing and/or duplicative, according to current ongoing research. Like other related content frameworks (e.g. the TOGAF content metamodel introduced in TOGAF 9), the framework covers a number of layers including both business and technology. The business layers can be harder to model because the concepts there are perhaps less tangible. However, this difficulty is not restricted just to ArchiMate.  Exchange file format  A standard model exchange file format has been developed for ArchiMate 2.1 and 3.0 models. This is an XML/XSD based file format, and is intended for exchange rather than a persistent file format.

The rigours of raising such a large family took its toll on her health and with time she became unable to walk. Nevertheless, she was a faithful member of Bethel Methodist Chapel in the village of Llanpumsaint and was often seen outdoors, carried aloft in her chair by her children or neighbours.Thomas, Arwyn (2004) Hanes Llanpumsaint, Carmarthenshire County Council Libraries and Community Learning Section Llwyd died in 1845, aged 79 years, one year after the death of her husband.

At the time of its sinking, it was the world's largest dynamically positioned flexible fall pipe rock dumping vessel.M.V. Rocknes . Retrieved on 2008-08-07. The ship was repaired during 2004 and 2005 and renamed Nordnes. Rocknes was owned by Kvitnes Shipping Company Ltd. of St. Johns, a part of the Hartmann group of Cadenberge, Germany. The ship was on a long-term charter to Van Oord ACZ, an international contractor specializing in dredging, rock dumping, and offshore and coastal construction. Conversion Conversion of the ship was commissioned on 3 May 2003 in response to the increasing demand for offshore rock dumping. The ship was converted from the self unloading bulk carrier MV Kvitnes at Keppel Verolme Shipyard, Botlek, The Netherlands. The actual conversion was led by a design team formed by Van Oord ACZ. Post-conversion, the ship remained a capable bulk carrier, albeit with a reduction of in cargo capacity and a loss of of sailing speed. Conversion was scheduled for a maximum of 112 days, and was completed in 124 days. Design challenges Its large size (largest in the world of its type at the time of construction) created design challenges. In order to create an economically feasible vessel of this size, the vessel must be designed with a high deadweight tonnage and a relatively high sailing speed to allow large quantities of rock, with densities ranging from per cubic meter or per cubic yard, to be rapidly transported to deeper waters farther from shore. Because of the density of the rock, the ship must include large void spaces located ahead of, astern of, and to either side of the cargo holds in the hull to provide sufficient stability. The holds themselves are loaded from above through hatches by shore-based equipment. They are designed with sloping sides and bottoms to allow them to be self-trimming and self-unloading via a conveyor belt running the length of the holds along the centerline of the ship at their lowest point. The conveyors transport the rock to the forward part of the ship, into a rock hopper, then into flexible fall pipes that extend out of the ship's bottom through a moon pool. The ends of the fall pipes are fitted with purpose-built, state of the art remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) which ensure that the fall pipes are accurately guided along the cable or pipeline, ensuring highly precise deposition of protective rock ballast. These ROVs can also be used for dredging, trenching, and jetting tools. The large quantity of heavy equipment mounted above the main deck of the ship raises its center of gravity and reduces its transverse stability. Sinking MV Rocknes hit shallow water and suddenly capsized in four minutes south of Bergen, Norway, while on her way to Emden in Germany, killing 18 of 30 crew. She remained afloat upside-down.Smit International corporate website: Salvage project details on Rocknes , February 2004, visited 12 February 2012  Salvage  The Dutch salvaging company Smit International was hired to salvage the ship. As she had remained afloat upside down, a plan was designed to parbuckle the vessel, an exceptional approach for a ship of this size. Cables were attached from the 9000-ton vessel to two barges that had been specially prepared for this operation. She was towed into the harbour of Bergen, still capsized and after repairs the bulk-carrier was put back in operation. In the media The sinking of Rocknes was broadcast on Discovery Channel in an episode of Blueprint for Disaster (in Europe broadcast under the name Minutes from Disaster). The sinking of the Rocknes also features in season 1 of Disasters at Sea.

Life  Bernhard Kellermann and Professor Otto Nagel, Painter, president of the Academy of Arts Bernhard Kellermann enrolled in 1899 at Technical University Munich initially in general studies, but later focused on German literature and painting. Beginning in 1904 he built a reputation as a novelist with early works such as Yester and Li, and reached extraordinary success through 1939 with 183 printings. The novel Ingeborg (1906) achieved an impressive 131 printings (until 1939). In the years before World War I his novels were published following journeys in the United States and Japan. His novel Das Meer (The Sea) was made into film by Peter Paul Felner and Sofar-Film- Produktion GmbH, featuring prominent film stars. His main work was Der Tunnel in 1913. It was highly successful for both him and his publisher, S. Fischer Verlag: circulation exceeded one million, and the work was translated into 25 languages. Kellermann's works became more critical of society and directly related to real-world events; his previous writings were marked with impressionism and prose. During World War I, Kellermann worked as a correspondent for the Berliner Tageblatt [Berlin's Daily Journal], one of Berlin's most influential newspapers, and published several war reports. In 1920, his novel Der 9. November (The Ninth of November) appeared, which argued critically against the behavior of soldiers and officers in relation to the people. This book doomed Kellermann during the Nazi era. Beginning in 1922 he produced numerous novellas and short stories. In 1926 Kellermann became a member of the Prussian poet academy, from which he was excluded 1933. In 1926 he divorced Lene Schneider-Kainer while on an extended odyssey of two years, often traveling by donkey or caravan visiting Russia, Persia, India, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Tibet, Hongkong and China. His novel The Ninth November was banned and burned publicly. Kellermann did not flee the country and offered no resistance, but wrote dime novels. After the collapse of the Nazi dictatorship, Kellermann worked with Johannes R. Becher in the Cultural Association of the GDR. He was a member of East Germany's Volkskammer as well as chairmen of the Society for German-Soviet Friendship. His commitment in the postwar years to East Germany caused a boycott of West German booksellers. His name was forgotten. Even shortly before his death in 1951 he rallied the writers of both German states to push for unified deliberations. Bernhard Kellermann is buried in the New Cemetery at Potsdam. His grave is preserved.

New Zealand contains many glaciers, mostly located near the Main Divide of the Southern Alps in the South Island. They are classed as mid-latitude mountain glaciers. There are eighteen small glaciers in the North Island on Mount Ruapehu. An inventory of South Island glaciers compiled in the 1980s indicated there were about 3,155 glaciers with an area of at least one hectare (2.5 acres).Chinn, Trevor J.H., (1988), Glaciers of New Zealand, in Satellite image atlas of glaciers of the world, U.S. Geological Survey professional paper; 1386, . Approximately one sixth of these glaciers covered more than 10 hectares.

New Zealand glaciers have been retreating since 1890, with an acceleration of this retreat since 1920. Most of the glaciers have thinned measurably and have reduced in size, and the snow accumulation zones have risen in elevation during the 20th century. In the period 1971‚Äì75, Ivory Glacier receded from the glacial terminus, and about 26% of the surface area of the glacier was lost over the same period. Since 1980 numerous small glacial lakes were created behind the new terminal moraines of several of these glaciers. Glaciers such as Classen, Godley and Douglas now all have new glacial lakes below their terminal locations due to the glacial retreat over the past 20 years. Satellite imagery indicates that these lakes are continuing to expand. There has been significant and ongoing ice volume losses on the largest glaciers: the Tasman, Ivory, Classen, Mueller, Maud, Hooker, Grey, Godley, Ramsay, Murchison, Therma, Volta and Douglas Glaciers. The retreat of these glaciers has been marked by expanding proglacial lakes and terminus region thinning. The loss in volume from 1975‚Äì2005 is 11 percent of the total. Several glaciers, notably the much-visited Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers on the West Coast, have periodically advanced, especially during the 1990s, but the scale of these advances is small when compared to 20th-century retreat. Both glaciers are currently more than shorter than a century ago. These large, rapidly flowing glaciers situated on steep slopes have been very reactive to small mass- balance changes. A few years of conditions favorable to glacier advance, such as more westerly winds and a resulting increase in snowfall, are rapidly echoed in a corresponding advance, followed by equally rapid retreat when those favorable conditions end. Hence glacier advance in a few locations is regarded as due to transient local weather conditions which brought more precipitation and cloudier, cooler summers since 2002.

The museum is tasked with acquiring, preserving and supplying knowledge about Slovenian railway history on the basis of the national collection. It is owned by Holding Slovenske Zeleznice, and is located in front of the former Ljubljana ≈†i≈°ka Railway station. History The notion of documenting the history of Slovene railways was born in the 1960s when it was becoming clear that the era of the steam locomotive was drawing to a close. If this was late in the day, it was because a decision had been made after WW2 to make Belgrade the base for railway museum activities for the whole Yugoslavia, a choice that led later to the establishment of the Belgrade Railway Museum. When the railwayman and woman of Slovenia elected to establish a museum of their own, they chose for its location the former locomotive shed at Ljubljana Siska. In its formative years, historic vehicles were temporarily displayed only in the 'roundhouse', a semicircular shed forming the centrepiece of the depot. This shed itself had been listed as part of the cultural heritage. In 1996, the year that marked the 150th anniversary of the advent of railways in Slovenia, the Museum of the Slovenian Railways presented to the public a permanent display of its most important railway artefacts. This was housed in the former railway training school in Kurilni≈°ka Street, close by the main site of the museum. The building, however, was old and in a ruinous state. With its demolition in 2002, the display had to be closed to the public for the duration. It reopened on a newly acquired site next to the roundhouse in 2004. As before, the display introduces visitors to the main spheres of railway activity. Aided by its maps and illustrations, visitors can trace the whole development of Slovenia's railway network. Communications Sound, sight and written communication systems played key roles in ensuring the safe operation of trains between stations. The newly invented electric telegraph was swiftly introduced to the railways. In 1876, the telephone was added. Later teleprinter took place of the telegraph. In 1963, the radio-telegraph as introduced to Slovenian railways as its operations centres were equipped with the required transmitters and receivers. The need for accurate timing presented itself only with the beginning of the railways in order to respond to the demand for regular and punctual traffic. The clocks on the posts along the railway line were regulated each day at noon to the signal given by the telegraph. On stations there is a main clock which controls the rest of the clocks by means of electricity so they all show exactly the same time. Rolling stock One of the exhibited locomotives The most prominent element of the railway is its rolling stock, especially its locomotives. Steam locomotives, which made the development of railways possible, first appeared in the early years of the 19th century. They reigned supreme for more than 150 years. Throughout this time, they were continually developed and improved. The extensive museum collection includes more than sixty locomotives and fifty other vehicles. Only the most important are on display. The oldest locomotive is the former Southern Railway No. 29.718, built in 1861. Keeping her close company is the diminutive No. 162-001. Her huge chimney earned her the nickname 'the Kamnic Cornet'. Next is the most eminent of the engines, express locomotive No. 03-002, designed in 1910 particularly for the Ljubljana-Trieste line. Nearby is mighty No. 06-018 of 1930, also designed especially for lines in Slovenia. The smallest of all is No. K3, a little gem built in 1892 especially for the narrow gauge Poljƒçane - Slovenske Konjice Line. Signalling and Safety Equipment Signalling apparatus and all the safety equipment associated with it allows rail travel to be speedy and safe. It protects trains when they are stationary and in motion. It ensures that points and signals are correctly set for their passage. Around 1900, electromechanical signalling and safety equipment was introduced. It has two essential controls. First is the lever frame at its base. This houses the levers used to change the positions of the points and signals. Second, and above the lever frame, are the indicator panels. These hold the electric block repeaters that maintain communication with the main control frame in the stationmaster's office, from which route orders for trains are despatched. The stationmaster's and the signalmen's apparatus is interlocked to ensure that mistakes cannot occur. Station Master's Office The station master's office is a key part of the railway station. It is the place where the traffic officer, the station 'chief', sees that all that is required to ensure the safe and regular operation of the trains is carried out. Using his signalling equipment, the traffic officer transmits order to his more remote signalmen about how the points and signals are to be set. In the past, the connections to adjoining stations needed to operate the trains were by telegraph. With the passage of time, the telephone and other modern telecommunication devices were introduced to assist him. On top of all this, he also saw to the ticket sales. Development, Construction and Maintenance The development of Slovenia's railway network is depicted with seven maps, each relating to a distinctive era. Historic boundary stones, engraved with the individual railway companies, bear witness in the display to each period. In their time, they marked the ownership of the land where the track was laid. Railway vehicles characteristically operate on special tracks, known as the 'permanent way'. Such tracks make it possible, for some effort, to transport loads several times heavier than normal roads would allow. Over time, calls for ever-heavier vehicles and greater speed demanded the development of stronger track. This involved changes in the size of the rails and in the ways in with they were secured, and in the sleepers, where wood gave way in some places to steel and, finally, concrete. The gangs that maintained the permanent way used a range of tool and vehicles. The small trolleys the employed to maintain the track and carry their equipment and material were allowed to travel on the ine only by special arrangement. Uniforms Full dress uniform of the kkStB Uniforms, 'garments of honour', were introduced in the early days of the railways so the railway employees could be distinguished from passengers. They differed from company to company. In Slovenia, until 1952, they also indicated employees' rank. Until 1927, on special occasions, higher-ranking officials wore full-dress uniforms. Railwaymen were always provided with the smaller items of equipment needed for their work. There varied little over the years.

The mediological method pays specific attention to the role of organisations and technical innovations, and the ways in which these can ensure the potency of cultural transmission - and thus the transformation of ideas into a civilisational worldview capable of sustained action. Overview The term was first coined and introduced in French as \\"m√©diologie\\" by the French intellectual R√©gis Debray in the \\"Teachers, Writers, Celebrities\\" section of his book Le pouvoir intellectuel en France, (Editions Ramsay, 1979). The English form of the term became more widely known and respected in the English-speaking world with the publication of the key text on mediology in English, Debray's Transmitting Culture (University of Columbia Press, 2004). Mediology was taught for the first time in the Sorbonne (Paris) in 2007. The practice of mediology is not a science, and thus is able to range across academic disciplines. The main areas involved are those of longitudinal history (the history of technologies, the history of the book, the histories and theories of aesthetics) and also research in communications and information theory. Mediology is not a narrow specialist area of contemporary academic knowledge (as media sociology is), nor does it aspire to be a precise science of signs (as semiotics does). It differs from the models put forward by communication studies, in that its focus is not isolated individuals and a fleeting few moments of communication. Instead mediologists study the cultural transmission of religions, ideologies, the arts and political ideas in society, and across societies, over a time period that is usually to be measured in months, decades or millennia. Debray argues that mediology \\"would like to bring to light the function of medium in all its forms, over a long time span - since the birth of writing. And without becoming obsessed by today's media.\\" Mediology must thus closely examine the methods used for the memorising, transmission, and displacement of cultural knowledge in any milieu. But it must balance its understanding of these with an equally close study of our individual modes of belief, thoughts, and competing social organisations. Mediology must further understand that such transmission is not simply happening within a lofty linguistic or textual discourse, but that transmission takes an equally valid concrete form in which \\"material technologies and symbolic forms\\" combine to produce things such as rituals, architecture, flags, special sites, customs, typefaces and book bindings, smells and sounds, bodily gestures and postures, all of which have a potent anchoring role in cultural transmission among ordinary people. Debray further points to the need to consider the role in transmission of all manner of non- media technical-cultural inventions, especially those of new forms of transportation. He gives the historical example of the bicycle, which he suggests was historically associated with: the rise of a democratic rational individualism; a new role for women in advanced societies; and the new kinetic ideas expressed in early modernist art and cinema. A mediologist might thus make an examination \\"within a system\\" (e.g. of systems of book production, of authors and publishers), or of \\"the interaction between systems\\" (e.g. how painting and early photography influenced each other), or even of \\"the interactions across systems\\" (e.g. the ways in which symbolic transmission of systematic knowledge is brought to intersect with the material history of actual transportation - such as desert trading routes and ancient religion, telegraph and railroad, the radio and airplanes, television and satellites, mobile phones and cars). Debray is generally critical of some of the ideas of Marshall McLuhan (whom he sees as being overly technologically determinist), and of the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. He also tries to step beyond Antonio Gramsci, in that he suggests that an ideology cannot be comprehended in ideological terms alone. Criticisms Criticisms of mediology in English so far have been found in two short book reviews and one article. The first, by the screenwriter Yvette B√≠r√≥ (Wide Angle magazine, Vol.18, No.1, January 1996), was a four-page book review of Debray's Vie et Mort de l'Image, in which she claimed to have discerned \\"traces of a strong, vulgar Marxist school of thought\\". The second review, by Pramod Nayor of the University of Hyderabad (Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory, Vol.8, No.1, Winter 2006) was a review of the English translation of Transmitting Culture (2004). In concluding the review Nayor notes the similarities of some aspects and directions of mediology to Birmingham School cultural studies ranging from \\"Raymond Williams through Stuart Hall\\". Nayor also notes that recent philosophers and historians of science - he cites Bruno Latour, Eugene Thacker and Dwight Atkinson - have also examined science in relation to \\"intersecting cultural, ethnic, economic and iconographic 'bases' of the transmission of culture\\" An article by Steven Maris in Fibreculture No.12 similarly suggests that Debray is too firmly embedded in \\"the French academic scene\\" and that thus \\"Debray's explicit engagement with other national scholarly traditions of media, communications and cultural studies in the works mentioned above is minimal\\". Maris also notes that mediology \\"predates much of the [current academic] interest in networked cultures and new media\\". Physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont have criticized Debray's work for using G√∂del's theorem as a metaphor without understanding its basic ideas, in their book Fashionable Nonsense. Debray engaged in dialogue with Bricmont in a 2003 book titled \\"√Ä l'ombre des lumi√®res : D√©bat entre un philosophe et un scientifique\\", which so far has not been translated into English. Despite such criticisms, the six- volume New Dictionary of the History of Ideas (2004) wrote of Debray that \\"His achievement is to have synthesized these earlier arguments into a practice with a powerful political project ahead of it.\\" (Vol.4, page 1394).

It is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lahore in Punjab, Pakistan. The Marist Fathers of Ireland established St. Anthony's High School in 1892. It now has been expanded to college level as well. The Sacred Heart Cathedral is located beside the school. When Lt. Col (ret) L. C. Rath was the principal in 1992, nearly 2,000 pupils were enrolled at the school with a staff of 100. As of now, the school has more than 100 qualified teachers. The motto of the institution is Scientia cum Virtute meaning \\"Knowledge with Virtue\\".  History  St. Anthony's was founded on 1 March 1892 in Peeli Kothi, Empress Road, Lahore by the Marist Fathers of Ireland. They named it St. Anthony's Catholic Day School. Rt. Reverend Doctor Van Don Bouch performed its opening ceremony with three students at Empress Road Lahore where St. Anthony's Church and Don Bosco School stand today. As it progressed, its site was shifted to 3-Lawrence Road, where it was renamed St. Anthony's High School in 1900 which was dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua who sympathised with the miserable and gave hope to the despaired people. The Bishop of Lahore Rt. Reverend Van Don Bouch performed the dedication ceremony. Father Leo took over as the first Principal of the school and started 'O' Level classes. Archbishop Sebastian Francis Shaw was the Chairman of the Board of Governors, H.D.Maxwell Shanthi the executive secretary, and Shahid Ambrose Moghul the Principal. There are about 1600 students and about 100 teaching staff at present. The school is upgraded to a college with the approval Archbishop Sebastian Francis Shaw in August 2013. The College was inaugurated by Cardinal Fernando Filoni in the presence of the Apostolic Nancio Edgar Pene Para and Sebastian Francis Shaw, the Archbishop of Lahore. To honour the legendary war veteran of Pakistan Air Force, Group Captain Cecil Chaudhry (Late), Government of Pakistan has renamed a part of Lawrence Road (the road in front of St. Anthony School) as Cecil Chaudhry Road. The renaming ceremony was held at St Anthony High School on Saturday, November 30, 2014. The ceremony was attended by friends and family members of the war hero, important personalities of the Christian community and significant civil and military dignitaries. Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Central Air Command Commanding Air Officer Air Vice Marshal Mujahid Anwar Khan was the chief guest on the occasion.

In 272 AD Emperor Aurelian had defeated the breakaway Kingdom of Palmyra; its king Vaballathus and his mother Zenobia were in Roman captivity. In 273 AD another rebellion against Roman rule broke out in Palmyra. The rebels first approached Aurelian's governor Marcellinus to become emperor, but he pretended to consider the offer as he sent a letter to Aurelian warning of the rebellion.Watson, Alaric, Aurelian and the Third Century, pg. 80 While the rebels were waiting they decided to elevate Septimius Antiochus, the reputed son of Zenobia, to the purple. Receiving Marcellinus's letter, the Emperor reacted quickly, and in the spring of 273 the city was brought back under Roman rule. Aurelian punished the city heavily, but allegedly spared Antiochus. Antiochus claimed to be descended from Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt, and the kings of Syria. There is some doubt as to his relationship to Zenobia. He may be unrelated, claiming kinship for political purposes; he may be her father, also named Antiochus; he may be indeed her biological son, or possibly an adopted son; he may be a son of Zenobia by someone other than Vaballathus, in which case he would have been quite young, perhaps as young as five.

Childhood and early career Hobley (pronounced to rhyme with 'nobly') was the son of Charles McDonald Hobley, the naval chaplain at the cathedral in Stanley and his wife Gladys, n√©e Blanchard. He was christened Dennys Jack Valentine McDonald-Hobley and attended Brighton College, a public school, from 1931‚Äì36. He began his acting career in repertory theatre, under the stage names Val Blanchard and Robert Blanchard, using his mother's maiden name, and toured before the Second World War in J. B. Priestley's Time and the Conways. War service During the Second World War, Hobley served with the Royal Artillery. He was involved in an ultimately abandoned plot to abduct Adolf Hitler and bring him to Britain. He also served in Ceylon with the British Forces Broadcasting Service. Post-war After being demobbed, Hobley was selected as an announcer for the post-war revival of BBC Television. He was also one of the comperes on the BBC's Come Dancing programme and appeared on various other shows as himself. He headed the team of BBC TV's early continuity announcers, which included Peter Haigh, Mary Malcolm and Sylvia Peters. He once introduced the politician Sir Stafford Cripps as 'Sir Stifford Crapps'.Michael Farrell, Key Issues for Primary Schools, Routledge, London, 2003, p. 70. Hobley was also a presenter of BBC TV's For Deaf Children from 1953 to 1955. He left the BBC in 1956 to join Granada Television for its opening. He returned to present It's A Knockout in 1966. During that year, he also returned to radio, fronting the Coffee Break Show on the pirate station Wonderful Radio London. On BBC radio, he was chairman of Does The Team Think?. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of BBC Television, he re-appeared in November 1986, as an in-vision announcer on BBC 2. He played himself as a beauty pageant judge in the 1960 film The Entertainer based on the play by John Osborne starring Laurence Olivier. Hobley appeared in London's West End in the farce No Sex Please, We're British and appeared in It Ain't Half Hot Mum and The Goodies, among other programmes.

A narrower version of the hypothesis, i.e. that asthma may be induced by chlorine related compounds from swimming pools, has been stated based on a small numbers of cases at least as early as 1995. An empirically motivated statement of the wider form of the hypothesis is first known to have been published on the basis of tests of the effects of nitrogen trichloride above chlorinated water on the lung as well as epidemiological evidence by a group of medical researchers led by Alfred Bernard of the Department of Public Health in the Catholic University of Louvain in Brussels, Belgium in 2003. In the epidemiological studies, the association between chlorinated swimming pools and asthma was found to be more significant than factors such as age, sex, ethnic origin, socioeconomic status, exposure to domestic animals and passive smoking (in a study in Brussels), and independent of altitude, climate, and GDP per capita (in a Europe-wide study of 21 countries). Effects of nitrogen trichloride (trichloramine) on the human lung Nitrogen trichloride has been directly linked as a factor causing asthma in two lifeguards and a swimming teacher. A study of 624 swimming pool workers found a significant correlation between upper respiratory symptoms and their total exposure to nitrogen trichloride. The study also found an excess risk in the workers for the specific symptoms indicative of asthma. In a study by Alfred Bernard's group, two hours exposure to an average concentration of 0.490 mg/m3 of nitrogen trichloride above a swimming pool was found in both children and adults to significantly increase the levels of the alveolar surfactant associated proteins A and B, which indicate hyperpermeability of lung epithelium. In other words, exposure to nitrogen trichloride was found to weaken the protective nature of the surface of the lungs. Epidemiological studies In a study of 341 schoolchildren, Bernard and his colleagues found that long-term attendance at indoor chlorinated swimming pools by the children up to the age of about 6‚Äì7 years was a strong predictor of airway inflammation (measured by exhaled nitric oxide) independently of other factors, while for those children susceptible to allergic problems, as defined by having a blood serum level of immunoglobulin E greater than 100 kIU/L, their total time spent at indoor chlorinated swimming pools was a strong predictor of the probability that they would have asthma. Relations to demographic and environmental variables In the Bernard group's study of 226 children in Brussels and the Ardenne region in 2003, asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (a test related to potential breathing difficulties) were not found to have any statistically significant correlation with the demographic and environmental factors of age, sex, ethnic origin, socioeconomic status or exposure to pets or passive smoking alone. However, when the time spent at chlorinated swimming pools (modified for pool height as a statistical way to indicate likely concentrations of chlorine related gases) was adjusted for exposure to pets and passive smoking, the significance of the correlations with asthma increased further. The authors describe this saying that a \\"very strong argument in [favour] of causality [between pool attendance and asthma] comes from the synergistic action of exposure to pets and [passive smoking], two well documented risk factors for asthma, which together considerably increase the strength of the associations, to levels largely above those usually observed in asthma epidemiology.\\" In a later study by the Bernard group of 190,000 children in 21 countries in Europe, it was found that 13- to 14-year- old children were 2% to 3.5% more likely to have or have had asthma for every additional indoor chlorinated pool per 100,000 inhabitants in their place of residence. Other atopic diseases such as hay fever or atopic dermatitis were found to be not associated with the presence of the pools. The association of asthma with the number of indoor chlorinated swimming pools per 100,000 inhabitants was found by the authors to be independent of altitude, climate, and GDP per capita. Scientific debate on the epidemiological studies After the publication of Bernard's group's 2003 study, B. Armstrong and D. Strachan described the study as \\"generally well conducted\\", but stated that some aspects of the statistical analysis and interpretation were \\"misleading\\", to the extent that \\"the epidemiological association of asthma with swimming pool use [was] not as strong as claimed by the authors\\". Following publication of Bernard's group's 2006 study, some concerns by P.A. Eggleston and a response by Bernard's group were published. For example, Eggleston argued that if \\"chlorinated compounds at indoor swimming pools could cause asthma\\", then \\"frequent and longer exposures at home\\" should be even stronger causes of asthma, in contradiction to the available evidence from a single group of children. Bernard's group's response was that while children at an indoor chlorinated pool \\"actively inhale [the chlorination products] as gases, aerosols, or even water\\", they are not usually involved in household cleaning tasks, so they could benefit from the hygienic effects of the chlorine based cleaning products while avoiding any significant contact with the related gases. Members of Bernard's group's declared that they had no potentially conflicting financial interests, while Eggleston declared that he had received money from the United States-based group called the Chlorine Chemistry Council. In a \\"Faculty Disclosure\\" statement in an asthma-related publication, it was declared that Eggleston is \\"a consultant for Chlorine Chemistry Council, Church and Dwight, Merck Sharp & Dohme, and Procter & Gamble, and is on the speakers' bureau for AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Merck.\\" Hypothesised mechanistic explanation Alfred Bernard and colleagues argue that what is common to the pool chlorine hypothesis and epidemiological studies associating chlorine based irritants to atopy could be that frequent, long-term disruption of the epithelium of the lung, which normally provides a protective barrier against various pathogens, could allow allergens to cross this barrier. This process would also cause certain proteins from the lung epithelium to have increased blood serum concentrations.

The temple was located 137 meters north-east of the Roman castra of Segontium on the outskirts of modern Caernarfon in Gwynedd, Wales. The remains were discovered by accident on 2 April 1958 and excavated by the National Museum of Wales in August of the following year under the direction of George Boon.G.C. Boon 1960. A Temple of Mithras at Caernarvon-Segontium. In Archaeologia Cambrensis 1960. pp136-178. The site was found to be already damaged by a sewer trench which cut across the anteroom and had removed part of the southeast corner, but the majority of the temple could be excavated. The excavators noted the site was quite marshy and this suggested that a stream had once flowed close to the temple at the bottom of the shallow valley. The marshy conditions caused the mechanical excavator to frequently fall into the excavation, causing further damage.  Mithraeum Phase I  The first phase of the templeBoon 1960, p141-146 (and all subsequent temples on the site) was orientated on an alignment 30 degrees east of north at the foot of the western side of a small shallow valley. The building measured 14.6m by 6.55 and is tentatively dated to the third century AD, a period when the fort was occupied by the Cohors I Sunicorum. The shrine consisted of an anteroom (narthex) at the southern end, followed by the temple proper which consisted of a sunken central nave flanked by low benches. This is typical of mithraic temples and enabled the temple to be clearly identified despite no sculptural or epigraphic evidence being found. A rectangular alcove stood at the northern end and would have held the tauroctony. Untrimmed beach boulders were used for the walls, which must have given the structure a rustic look. No trace of the bonding mortar for the stones survived. Several fragments of purple Cambrian slate tiles were found belonging to the roof. The narthex, measuring 1.82m x 5.48m, was almost totally destroyed and no trace of any features survived, including the floor covering. The shrine measured 10.6m x 5.48m with a 2.43m wide niche at the northern end, 45 cm deep. The benches were 1.52m deep and 9.1 meters long. Steps must have led down into the nave, though this part was destroyed by the sewer trench. The bench tops were at ground level, the same level as the narthex. The only dating evidence came from a worn denarius coin of Faustina I (138-9 AD) found on top of one of the benches.  Mithraeum Phase II  For the second phase,Boon 1960 p147-150 timber colonnades were inserted, presumably to help support the weight of the slate roof. The ten timber columns were supported by small stone bases, each base set on a bed of cobbles. The fact that each base is different (including one circular in shape while the rest are all square) suggested to the excavators that they were salvaged from various other buildings. A v-shaped tile-lined drain was cut into the floor and entered the temple through the exterior wall just north of the end of the south bench and ran diagonally across the nave to terminate at the front of the middle of the north bench. A tank must have existed here to collect the trickle of spring water. No dating evidence existed for this phase, however the excavator surmised by the lack of wear on the Phase I floor that Phase II occurred very soon after.  Mithraeum Phase III  The third and final phase of the temple was preceded by the partial collapse of the roof.Boon 1960 p150-155 Broken slates were used to raise the level of the nave, this could have been to help avoid the waterlogging that may have affected the earlier two phases. This layer was sealed by a new cobbled floor throughout the nave. To compensate for the raising of the nave height, the benches and the area in front of the niche were raised. Small flights of two steps were now erected at the front of the benches near the entrance into the nave and steps were provided to lead up to the area in front of the niche. A stone platform 0.9m x 1.52m was built to the right of the niche, possible to serve as a statue base. The colonnade from Phase II was removed and at least five small pedestals were placed against the bench fronts. A layer of soil was found,Boon 1960 p155 no more than 60 mm thick, between the Phase III floor and layer of burnt debris that sealed the site. This indicated a period of abandonment prior to the burning of the roof and also explains why no Mithraic sculptures were found in the building as they had all been removed. This would equate well with the removal of the garrison of Segontium in c290 AD.  Bibliography  G.C. Boon 1960. A Temple of Mithras at Caernarvon-Segontium.

During World War I, she was known as USAT El Sol in service with the United States Army and as USS El Sol (ID-4505) in service with the United States Navy. At the end of war, she reverted to her original name of SS El Sol. SS El Sol was one of four sister ships that carried cargo and a limited number of passengers for the Morgan Line. She was acquired by the U.S. Army after the United States entered World War I in April 1917, and converted to carry horses and mules to France. In August 1918, the ship was transferred to the U.S. Navy and continued transporting animals through the end of the war. El Sol returned to the Morgan Line in 1919 and sailed with them until March 1927, when she sank in New York Harbor after colliding with Sac City of the American Diamond Line. A portion of the ship's cargo was salvaged but the ship was scrapped later in the year.  Early career  SS El Sol was a cargo and passenger steamship launched on 11 May 1910 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. of Newport News, Virginia (yard no. 130), and delivered to the Atlantic division of the Morgan Line on 20 August 1910.

The vessel sailed for the Morgan Line, the brand name of the Southern Pacific Steamship Company (a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Railroad), which employed her to carry cargo and a limited number of passengers between New York; New Orleans, the eastern terminus of the Southern Pacific line; and Galveston, Texas.  World War I  After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, El Sol was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) on behalf of the United States Army, who designated her as an animal transport ship.Krenzelok Although there is no information about the specific conversion of El Sol, for other ships this typically meant that any second- or third-class passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.Crowell and Wilson, pp. 313‚Äì14. Sources do not reveal all of El Sol's movements, but it is known that she departed on her second trip to France from Newport News on 10 February 1918.

The convoy was escorted by when it departed from New York on 18 February,Crowell and Wilson, p. 605. and arrived at Saint-Nazaire on 4 March. Ten animals on board El Sol died or were destroyed during the crossing. The next recorded activity of El Sol was on 3 August, when she was transferred from the Army to the U.S. Navy and commissioned the same day with Lieutenant Commander G. Anderson, USNRF, in command. El Sol was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) and continued to carry animals and supplies for the U.S. Army. By August, each animal transport ship had a transport veterinarian and a permanent veterinary detachment to care for the animals while on board the ship. El Sol had also been joined by two of her sister ships, and in animal transport duty. She next departed Newport News on 23 August 1918 with 520 horses and mules on board. Upon arrival at Saint- Nazaire on 19 September, El Sol delivered her complete load of animals; none had died during the passage.

While returning to the United States from her last NOTS sailing in late March 1919, El Sol responded to distress calls from , a Navy troop transport which had a damaged rudder and was disabled. El Sol came to the aid of the stricken ship, which was east of New York, to attempt to take her under tow. During the day on 28 March, Scranton attempted to run a towline to El Sol by sending a launch in the rolling seas, but it capsized, killing three men. Ultimately, El Sol stood by Scranton for over 40 hours until minesweeper arrived and took Scranton under tow. At the conclusion of her last NOTS voyage on 3 April, El Sol was converted to a troop transport and assigned to the Navy's Cruiser and Transport Force on 15 April.

Postwar civilian service  El Sol resumed cargo service with the Morgan Line, where she had eight years of uneventful operation. On 11 March 1927, however, El Sol was inbound to New York with a $1,000,000 cargo of pig iron, copper, and bales of cotton. When a heavy fog settled over New York Harbor, Captain Charles H. Knowles ordered his ship to anchor until the fog cleared. As El Sol was being maneuvered into position at about 07:45, the American Diamond Line ship Sac City hit a glancing blow to El Sol, bounced off and then struck El Sol a second time, ripping through El Sol's plating. Sac City's bow had some slight damage, but El Sol sank quickly in about of water about a half-mile (800 m) south of the Statue of Liberty. Out of El Sol's crew of 45 men, 44 were rescued; the ship's carpenter, who could not swim, was last seen clutching the ship's rail as it went below the surface. El Sol settled on the bottom at a 45¬∞ angle with only the tops of her masts protruding above the surface; the Morgan Line house flag‚Äîa blue house flag with a red M inside a white star‚Äîstill fluttered in the breeze. Even though the sunken vessel was not considered a hazard to navigation, in another fog two days later a Staten Island Ferryboat nearly hit El Sol's wreck. In a hearings before the United States Steamboat Inspection Service, Captain Knowles of El Sol and the captain of Sac City were both cleared of wrongdoing in the collision, and the blame was laid on the heavy fog. On 31 July, The New York Times reported on the cargo salvage operations still underway on the wreck of El Sol. In three months of continuous operations, the salvage company reported that about 35% of the sunken ship's cargo had been recovered. The hulk of El Sol was scrapped later in 1927.

Schaper Mfg. Co., Inc. as it was originally known, was a game and toy company founded in 1949 by William Herbert Schaper in Robbinsdale, Minnesota. \\"Herb\\" Schaper published a variety of games but was best known for having created the children's game, Cootie. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the company operated as Schaper Toys, a subsidiary of Kusan Inc. In 1986, Schaper Toys was acquired by Tyco Toys. Cootie was the company's bestseller. History William Herbert \\"Herb\\" Schaper was a Minnesota postman who created, developed, and manufactured a children's game known as Cootie.Heenpin History Museum: Objects:Dolls & Toys. Retrieved October 31, 2008. After whittling a fishing lure in 1948, he molded the object in plastic, fashioned a game around it, and formed the H. W. Schaper Mfg. Co., Inc. to manufacture and publish the game. In the fall of 1949, the game was launched on the market, and sold through Dayton's department stores. Schaper sold 5,000 Cootie games by 1950, and over 1.2 million games by 1952. Schaper Toys manufactured a host other games including the well-known Ants in the Pants and Don't Break the Ice. While most children's games of the period were made of paper and cardboard, Schaper Toys was one of the first toy and game manufacturers to extensively use plastic in its products. Schaper games were constructed almost completely of plastic. The company introduced Stompers, a battery-powered line of toy trucks and other vehicles in 1980. In the early 1980s, Schaper became one of the licensed producers of Playmobil in the United States. A large deal with McDonald's to promote Playmobil by distributing figures in Happy Meals ended badly when the toys were found to violate American child safety regulations. Schaper Manufacturing operated as the Schaper Toy division of Kusan Inc. in the 1970s and 1980s.Crowley,Ellen T. and Donna J. Wood. Trade Names Dictionary. Gale Research, 1974. . In 1986, Schaper Toys was acquired by Tyco Toys, which is now a division of Mattel Inc. In the deal, Tyco sold the rights to four Schaper games including Cootie to Hasbro's Milton Bradley division. Cootie is manufactured and sold today through Milton Bradley with legs featuring in-line skates, sneakers, and other fanciful accessories. Gameography Schaper Christmas ad, ca. 1952 Big Mouth Big Mouth (1968) is a game for 2 to 4 players. Each player is given a giant fork, a green insect, and a paper plate that contains 6 different plastic food items (bananas, carrots, grapes, lemons, pineapples, strawberries). The players take turns using a spinner. If a spin yields a food item, all players attempt to be the first to feed that item to a cardboard clown using an oversized fork. The insect acts as a wildcard. The losers return the food to their plates after each round. The goal is to be the first player to feed all the food on their plate to the cardboard clown. Clean Sweep Clean Sweep (1967) is a game for 2, 3, or 4 players. The object is to \\"collect as much 'good' litter (scattered trash) as possible and at the same time avoid collecting any of the 'bad' litter.\\" Don't Blow Your Top Don't Blow your Top (1972). Dunce Dunce (1955) is a game for two to four players. Its object is to avoid being the first player to complete a plastic figurine of a boy wearing a dunce cap. Components consist of a stool, a body, a head, a dunce cap and a die. The plastic parts are acquired at the roll of the die beginning with the stool and ending with the cap. The player who completes his figurine first is the loser.Dunce: How to Play. Schaper, 1955. King of the Hill \\"King of the Hill\\" (1963) is a game for two to four players.

It can be reached throughout Scandinavia by satellite. The founder and executive editor of the channel is Jan Hanvold. A sister channel based in Sweden, TV Vision Norden was launched in 2015. Organization TV Visjon Norge has 75 employees, in addition to a number of volunteers. The television department of the organisation has 30 employees. 46% of the channel's programming is produced by its \\"broadcasting partners\\", and the remainder by the channel itself. Visjon Norge also does aid work in Eastern Europe and Africa, and has aired programs about its work in Moldova. In addition it operates two radio stations, and has a monthly magazine with 17,000 subscribers (2011). The organisation has its headquarters in Drammen. Since 2011 it has an annual operating revenue (nearly all donations) of around . History Visjon Norge began broadcasting on March 24, 2003. It airs over Scandinavia 24 hours a day, with a variety of Christian-themed programming, aiming to preach the gospel of Jesus and to support the state of Israel. The company is owned by Visjonskirken, a local congregation founded by Jan Hanvold and his wife Inger in 2001, but the channel itself is officially interdenomenational. The channel claimed 100,000 more or less regular viewers by 2007, in addition to Norway, mostly in Sweden and the Faroe Islands. It is available to 98% of Norwegian households, and averages around 20,000 daily viewers in Norway as of 2015 (TNS Gallup). Visjon Norge has been cited as a central part in mobilizing the development of a new Christian right in Norway, and accused of promoting The Christians Party. Abroad, the channel has held meeting campaigns with thousands of people in the Faroe Islands. TV Vision Norden Due to a large viewership and more programming from Sweden, Visjon Norge attempted to branch out to the country with a television studio in Floda, Lerum in 2010. While the initial attempt to launch a stand-alone channel sizzled through, the sister channel TV Vision Norden was finally launched in 2015. The channel is based in Gothenburg. Programming In addition to its own programming, the channel broadcasts programs by various groups and people, including Forum Idag, Hanne Nabintu Herland, Oslo Symposium (biennial conference), ES TV, Dansk TV Mission, Open Doors, Hope Channel, and formerly included Hillsong, Youth of Europe and Livets Ord. In 2014 Livets Ord was replaced with a slot for Ludvig Nessa and the \\"Church of Norway in Exile\\", following Jan Hanvold attacking Livets Ord leader Ulf Ekman as a \\"heretic\\" after Ekman converted to Roman Catholicism, and accusing Livets Ord of \\"sectarianism\\" and of operating as a \\"personality cult\\". Controversies In its early years TV Visjon Norge was funded by the aid foundation Visjon Norge Misjon, formerly Visjon Bibel Center (VBC) founded by Jan Hanvold in 1989, which has been criticized for using most of its donated aid money on television operations and purchasing property for TV Visjon Norge. VBC reportedly spent on property for TV Visjon Norge in 2003, and in 2007 purchased a property in Drammen for for the television channel. In 2006 the channel was reprimanded by the Norwegian Media Authority after a rerun of an evening show was aired in an early morning timeslot on NRK2 (which formerly had slots for independent programming), showing an explicit video of an abortion procedure. Jan Hanvold apologized and described the incident as a technical mistake. In 2015 Visjon Norge was criticized for shows in which the Nigerian pastor Bayo Oniwinde had called on viewers to donate large sums of money to the channel, asking for to 200.000, in order to get blessings and miracles. In response to the criticism Jan Hanvold defended Oniwinde, noting some cultural differences and that the portion of the show had been taken out of context, while stating that Visjon Norge did not support any notion of direct payment for miracles or healing. In February 2020, preacher Dionny Baez appeared on Visjon Norge telling viewers to donate 2020 kroner, saying it would protect the giver's children from the COVID-19 pandemic.

CAMM shares some common features and components with the ASRAAM air-to-air missile, but with updated electronics and an active radar homing seeker. The Common Anti-Air Modular Missile is replacing the Sea Wolf missile on Type 23 frigates of the Royal Navy since 2018, will replace the Rapier missile in British Army service and is contributing to the updating of MBDA's ASRAAM in service with the Royal Air Force. [1][9] Characteristics CAMM is a point defence and local area defence missile designed to respond to sophisticated missile attacks and has the capability to defend against saturation attacks of supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles, aircraft and other high-performance targets.[7] It does this via multiple channels of fire, providing 360-degree simultaneous coverage and high degrees of manoeuvrability. MBDA state that CAMM has a \\"high rate of fire against multiple simultaneous targets\\",[23] providing capabilities comparable to the Aster 15 missile. Design characteristics allow for low cost by modularity and minimising electromechanical complexity through implementing most functionality in software. Additionally, the command and control software reuses over 75% of that developed for the PAAMS system.[11] CAMM has a minimum operational range of less than 1 km and a maximum range greater than 25 km, although IHS Jane's reports that trials have a shown a capability of up to 60 km. These ranges are significantly greater than the 1‚Äì10 km range of Sea Wolf and other systems CAMM will replace.[22] CAMM weights 99 kilograms (218 lb), is in length, 166 millimetres (6.5 in) diameter and reaches generous supersonic speeds of Mach 3 (or 1,020 meters per second). CAMM's claimed benefits include: * Active RF seeker that means there is no need for complex and high-cost fire control/illumination radars * A two-way datalink. * A Soft Vertical Launch (SVL) system that offers 360¬∞ degree coverage. This uses a gas generator to eject the missile from its canister, the benefits of which include increased range ‚Äì by saving all the rocket motor's energy to power the intercept ‚Äì reduced minimum intercept range, reduced stress on launch platforms, reduced maintenance costs, more compact installations on ships and there being no need to manage the hot gas efflux on board, reduced launch signature, and on land the possibility of firing the missile from wooded or urban areas. * CAMM comes in its own launch canisters, or alternately can be quad-packed into existing vertical launching systems. CAMM's Extended Range application is known as CAMM-ER and has been under development with MBDA for the Italian MoD since 2013[26]. The CAMM-ER (extended range variant) shares the same characteristics of the original CAMM with the exception of an additional rocket booster which significantly increases the missile's engagement range, out to 45 km and a slightly adapted missile structure. The missile is 160 kilograms (350 lb) in weight, 4.2 metres (14 ft) in length, 190 millimetres (7.5 in) diameter. History The Common Anti-Air Modular Missile has its roots in a Technology Demonstration Programme (TDP), jointly funded by MBDA and the Ministry of Defence as part of the United Kingdom's Future Local Area Air Defence System (FLAADS). Phase 1 of the TDP worked on technologies for soft vertical launch, the low-cost active radar seeker, a dual-band two- way datalink and a programmable open systems architecture. Phase 2 began in 2008 and covered the manufacture of flight-worthy subsystems, mid-course guidance firings and captive airborne seeker trials on a Qinetiq Andover experimental aircraft. The Soft Vertical Launch was proven over a series of trials, culminating in a successful truck launch in May 2011. The MoD decision on the business case for the naval variant was scheduled for 2010. After publishing the Strategic Defence and Security Review in October 2010, the business case was approved in April 2011. FLAADS is part of a wider UK 'Complex Weapons' programme to deliver a variety of UK industry based weapons. FLAADS is intended to deliver a common weapons platform (the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM)) to equip forces in the air, land and maritime environments.Future Local Area Air Defence System Hansard, 7 Mar 2012Complex Weapons Hansard, 15 July 2008 During the early stages of the FLAADS programme, requirements were identified for the new missile to meet the known and unknown air threats of not only the present, but those well into the future too. Thought was particularly given to meeting a target set \\"of complex airborne targets which are typified by high speed, rapid evasive manoeuvres, low signatures and advanced countermeasure[s].\\"FLAADS MBDA, June 2010 Milestones *In January 2012, MBDA and the Ministry of Defence announced a contract worth ¬£483 million to fully develop the maritime application of CAMM known as Sea Ceptor for the Royal Navy.\\"Sea Ceptor, MBDA‚Äôs Next Generation Air Defence System Gets Go Ahead For Royal Navy Frigates\\", 31 January 2012, navyrecognition.com *In October 2013, the Royal New Zealand Navy selected CAMM to equip their Anzac-class frigates and . *In August 2014, the Chilean Navy emerged as a potential export customer for CAMM to equip their Type 23 frigates. *In November 2014, the Brazilian Navy selected CAMM to equip their future Tamandar√©-class frigates. *In January 2015, the Ministry of Defence announced that it had signed a development and manufacturing deal with MBDA in late December 2014. *In May 2016, the Spanish Navy selected CAMM-ER to equip their future F110-class frigates. Later in 2018 the missile lost against RIM-162 Evolved SeaSparrow Missile Block II *In September 2017, the first Sea Ceptor missile was successfully fired at sea from the Type 23 frigate, HMS Argyll. Applications MBDA states that by purchasing the same missile to meet the air defence needs of both armies and navies, both services are able to utilise a common stockpile that reduces procurement and support costs.  Sea  The maritime application of CAMM is known as Sea Ceptor. MBDA claim that CAMM has a \\"wide target set\\", including the capability to engage small naval vessels, which would give the missile a limited surface-to-surface role.[24] A Royal Navy Officer of the Type 23 Frigate HMS Westminster stated: ‚ÄúWestminster managed to explore the real potential of the system during her training and to say it is a real game changer is an understatement. Unlike its predecessor, the system is capable of defending ships other than Westminster herself. Whether it‚Äôs engaging multiple air threats or fast incoming attack craft, Sea Ceptor represents a massive capability upgrade for the Type 23 frigate.‚Äù  Land  On land, CAMM is known as Land Ceptor by the British Army and the whole land-based air defence system is known as Sky Sabre. The system has over three times the range of its predecessor Rapier. For international customers, MBDA markets the \\"Enhanced Modular Air Defence Solutions (EMADS).\\" This is a rapidly deployable point and area defence system designed to protect mobile and static high value assets. It provides all- weather protection against air targets, including low level terrain and high altitude threats. Each EMADS launcher is scalable and can carry multiple CAMM or CAMM-ER missiles as well as being mobile with off-road capability. The system provides EMADS with pre-launch targeting information based on track data from a suitable radar sensor.https://www.janes.com/article/77933/british- army-unveils-sky-sabre-air-defence-system Air Originally, the CAMM program aspired to provide Land, Sea and Air launched capabilities, but it was deemed more effective to instead develop CAMM for use for land and sea only, while using the well established ASRAAM short range air-to-air missile to cover the air launched role. However, technologies and components developed for CAMM have been used as part of an upgrade to ASRAAM. Operators Map of CAMM operators in dark grey, and future operators in lighter grey.

It was produced by Pennant Picture Productions and presented by British Lion Film Corporation. The film is based on the 1931 play by Edgar Wallace. This production was the second time that Wallace‚Äôs play had been adapted for the cinema. The first production in 1932 was directed by T. Hayes Hunter and starred Emlyn Williams. The BBC also produced two television versions; the first in 1938 and the second in 1983 which starred Warren Clarke and Virginia McKenna. In 2008, the film was released on DVD by Odeon Entertainment as part of their 'Best of British' collection. Prior to this release, the film had not been seen in public since its original release. Plot The story is a thriller that revolves around the Lebanon family who live at Mark‚Äôs Priory. Lady Lebanon (Helen Haye) tells her son, William, Lord Lebanon (Marius Goring) that he must marry his cousin Isla Crane (Penelope Dudley Ward) to continue the family line. However, William has no intention of marrying Isla and matters are made more complicated due to Isla falling in love with architect, Richard Ferraby (Patrick Barr), who has come to Mark‚Äôs Priory to draw up renovation plans. At the same time, the strange behaviour of two footmen and the family physician (Felix Aylmer) add to the mystery surrounding the family and eventually rumour and speculation lead to a murderous conclusion.

He has written and directed various films and videos, made dozens of radio programmes for Icelandic national radio and written articles on art, politics and culture. His filmmaking style has been described by critics as laid back, amusing and minimalistic. Biography Einar Thor grew up on a farm in northwest Iceland, and in his early years became also a part-time sailor in the nearby village, Flateyri, where he was also born. He used to be a year ahead in junior school and left his home ground at the age of 14 for further studies in south Iceland, left school at the age of 17 to work in various jobs in fishing and farming, but continued his studies again at the age of 19. At 23 he went as a volunteer to Nicaragua in 1988 during the Contras conflict. He returned to Europe where he graduated from the London Film School with a distinction in directing in 1992. He also studied mass media theory and Spanish at the University of Iceland and at the Universidad de M√°laga, Spain, from 1988 to 1990, and later continued his academic studies at City University, London where he completed an MA in Art Management and Policy Making in the arts in 2001. Career Prior to films he took part in number of European conferences on cultural and social issues in Denmark, Germany, France and Spain as a member of the Executive Committee of the Icelandic Youth Council in 1989, and was actively involved in international exchange programs in Europe and Central America in 1988. During his London years in the early 1990s he received a European council's grant to study in Spain, jury prize for his short film in Antalya, Turkey, nomination for the young film maker of the year award at the Edinburg film festival, and appeared in number of short films and videos as an actor, including the lead in a Soul II Soul music video for UN in 1994. In late 1990s Einar was critical of the handing of film policy in Iceland, and in 2001 wrote his MA theses, \\"Film Policy in Iceland\\", a study on the state of the film community in Iceland at the time. Among his published articles in the late 1990s were pieces on the work of the Scandinavian writers Ibsen and Strindberg and interview with their English translator Michael Meyer, in addition to the short stories \\"Dolores\\" and \\"Time & Space\\". After his latest dramatic work, Hei√∞in, aka Small Mountain was released (2008), Variety magazine called the film a 'kooky charm' and a critic at the National Radio 2 said he \\"continues to develop the art of filmmaking in the country\\", but Einar had previously made the satirical, stage-play-like movie The Third Name (2003), that went mostly unnoticed in his country. \\"Hei√∞in\\" was famously condemned for 'sacrificing a lamb for a movie' receiving 'zero stars' by some cinema goers, whereas in fact a lamb was convincingly fake-slaughtered in a key scene in the movie. In October 2010 his feature documentary North West was premiered in cinema in Iceland receiving favorable reviews and running for 6 weeks. In addition to North West / 2nd part, it was released on DVD late 2011. The documentary tells the story of a snow avalanche which hit the town he was born in.

Because of their small numbers, rare breeds may have a threatened conservation status, and they may be protected under regional laws. Many countries have organizations devoted to the protection and promotion of rare breeds, for which they each have their own definition. In botany and horticulture, the parallel to rare animal breeds are heirloom plants, which are rare cultivars. Definitions A rare breed Manx Loaghtan sheep at Cregneash, Isle Of Man. There are fewer than 1,500 registered breeding Manx Loaghtan females in the United Kingdom. There are several definitions of \\"breed\\" and \\"rare breed\\". Breeds may be defined as a group of animals that share visible characteristics, such as Pinto horses, which are all spotted. A stricter definition insists that breeds are \\"consistent and predictable genetic entities\\", which means that individuals from that breed will produce offspring that is predictably similar to their genitors, and that this similarity is genetically based. This biological definition is useful for conservation, which treats breeds as reliable sources of genetic diversity. Conservation organisations each have their own definition of what constitutes a rare breed. The Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST) and The Livestock Conservancy (TLC) both divide rare breeds into five categories, \\"critical\\" being the rarest. TLC places a livestock breed under \\"critical\\" status when it has \\"fewer than 200 annual registrations in the United States and estimated global population less than 2,000\\". The RBST determines the status of a breed by the number of its breeding females in the United Kingdom. For horses and sheep, fewer than 300 is considered \\"critical\\", whereas goats and pigs must have fewer than 100 to join that category. The Poultry Club of Great Britain considers a poultry breed \\"Rare\\" when it does not have its own breed club. These \\"Rare Breeds\\" are catered by the Rare Poultry Society (RPS). The RPS does not look after breeds that count few individuals but have their own breed club. The British Rabbit Council (BRC) notes in its breed standards those rabbit breeds that have been recognized by the affiliated Rare Varieties Rabbit Club, of which there are currently 26 breeds. Causes Major factors causing breeds to become rare are reported to include increased use of exotic breeds, weak policies and institutions in animal genetic resources management, neglect of certain breeds because of a lack of profitability or competitiveness, the intensification of production systems, the effects of diseases and disease management and loss of pastures or other elements of the production environment. In postwar Britain, for example, the introduction of the Poland China pig and the Texel sheep affected populations of historic breeds, which were seen as less profitable for farmers. Conservation Tamworth is a pig breed that is rare in both its native country and abroad. Several organizations ‚Äì the Food and Agriculture Organization (United Nations), The Livestock Conservancy, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust (UK), Rare Breeds Canada, the SVF Foundation (US) ‚Äì promote conservation of rare livestock and poultry breeds for their unique traits, which can contribute to general biodiversity and cultural heritage. Animal Husbandry can be important to livestock production in harsh environments and may contribute to the adaptation of livestock populations to challenges such as shifts in disease epidemiology, climate or market demands.FAO. 2015. The State of the World's Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Rome. Conservation activities may include in situ conservation programmes supporting the maintenance of breeds in their normal production environments (i.e. on farms, ranches or in pastoralist herds or flocks) FAO. 2013. In vivo conservation of animal genetic resources. FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines. and ex situ conservation programmes in which animals are kept at sites such as zoos or special conservation farms or genetic material (e.g. semen or embryos) is maintained in a cryoconserved form.FAO. 2012. Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources. FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines. No. 12. Rome. In 2009, The Livestock Conservancy launched an online classified advertising service for promoting rare breeds. It allows the general public to \\"browse listings of rare breed livestock and poultry for sale, rare breed products such as meats and wools and other items that help secure the future of rare breeds\\". Other interests of rare breeds Beyond the concerns of conservation organisations, there are other reasons for individuals or groups to keep rare breed animals. Rare breeds can be popular with hobby farmers, as they often require less intensive management. Some rare breeds are kept by tourist attractions for their value in attracting visitors. Some farmers also prefer to sell meat from rare breeds, as they believe such breeds offer higher quality produce.

His work is mainly written in his native Welsh language, and is noted for adapting the established style and context of Welsh poetry from a rural and bygone age to that of a modern industrial landscape, while retaining traditional prosody and metre. Life Robert Rhydwenfro Williams was born in Pentre, a village in the Rhondda in Wales, on 29 August 1916.Davies (2008), pg 750. He was one of at least two children. Like most families in the area at that time, Williams' family worked in the coal mining industry but, after an economic depression struck the area, his family moved to England in search of work, settling in the village of Christleton, in 1931. Williams stayed in England for some time, about ten years, before returning to Wales in 1941.Obituary:Rhydwen Williams bnet United Kingdom Fortunately for Williams, he found more opportunities in Wales than he did in England, where he'd worked menial jobs; he was made pastor of a Baptist chapel in Ynyshir and was able to study, although intermittently, at both Swansea University, then known as University College of Swansea, and Bangor University. During World War II, in the midst of the Liverpool Blitz, Williams served in a Quaker relief unit, having been a conscientious objector as both a pacifist and a Welsh nationalist. Additionally, for his gifted speaking voice, comparable with that of Welsh actor Richard Burton, he would often read poetry for the Welsh version of the Home Service on the BBC and found popularity as a minister, despite his anti-war pro-Wales stance. As a member of the Cadwgan Circle,Guide to Wales, Welsh Literature Go Britannia! website he mixed with fellow members J. Gwyn Griffiths, Pennar Davies and Gareth Alban Davies, and was especially close to J. Kitchener Davies. From this informal group of like- minded intellectuals, Williams developed a style of writing and literal ethic opposed to eisteddfodic tradition. Amongst his heroes were writers Aldous Huxley, W H Auden and George Orwell. Although Williams' poetry was not in keeping with the tradition of the National Eisteddfod, he was still embraced by it. In 1946, at Mountain Ash, he won the Crown competition for the poem Yr Arloeswr (English: The Pioneer) and again in 1964 for Yr Ffynhonnau (English: The Springs). Leaving Ynyshir in 1946 he travelled Wales, holding pastorates at Resolven and Pont-lliw near Swansea until 1959, before spending a year at Rhyl. Williams later moved from his ministry to accept a post at Granada Television in Manchester, presenting Welsh language programmes, in which his skills as a communicator came to the fore. He wrote television scripts; one about Dietrich Bonhoeffer was the first Welsh-language television play to be broadcast on a foreign network. Of all Williams' work, his trilogy Cwm Hiraeth is seen by many as his finest achievement;Davies (2008), pg 960. semi- autobiographical, the three books form a prose epic of life in the depression hit Rhondda through the eyes of the author's Uncle Sion, a poet and thinker. In the 1970s, Williams and his family lived in a council house at Coed yr Haf, in Ystrad Mynach, where he continued to be an active member of the Welsh political party Plaid Cymru. He suffered a stroke in 1981, which had a negative effect on his physical health for the remainder of his life. Nonetheless, despite his health, he continued to actively write and publish new material, serving an editor of Barn, a Welsh-language current affairs magazine, from 1980 until 1985. He ultimately passed away in Merthyr Tydfil on 29 August 1997, at the age of 81, leaving behind his wife and son.

She was born and raised in Alton, Hampshire, England, and became involved in the local folk club scene in the late 1960s. She has played in a number of bands and formed a number of collaborations with other artists, but has become well known in recent times as a solo artist and songwriter. She enjoys singing songs with meaningful words and has named her major influences as Bob Dylan, Al Stewart, Dave Evans, Leon Rosselson, Billy Bragg, Bruce Cockburn and Robb Johnson. Several of her own songs have entered the repertoires of notable artists, such as Martin Carthy and June Tabor and, in 2000, Holland received the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards \\"Best Song of 1999\\" for her song \\"A Place Called England\\". Colin Irwin wrote of her in fRoots magazine: \\"The proof that outstanding contemporary songs are still being written‚Äù. She now lives in Leith, Scotland.  Career history = Early collaborations  Hot Vultures = Her first work as a professional musician was as bassist and, later, singer in Hot Vultures, alongside Ian A. Anderson. By this time she had moved to Farnham, Surrey. Hot Vultures toured and recorded from 1973 to 1979. = English Country Blues Band = Hot Vultures became the English Country Blues Band (ECBB) when Holland and Anderson were joined by Rod Stradling and Sue Harris (Sue Harris later being replaced by Chris Coe). = Tiger Moth = The ECBB expanded to become Tiger Moth, an electric country dance band, which lasted until 1989. = Orchestre Super Moth = This was a further expansion of the Tiger Moth line-up, including occasional musicians from around the world, and represented a move away from purely English and American traditions to become one of the first \\"crossover\\" world music bands. Alongside Holland and the other Tiger Moth members, line-ups have included such respected international musicians as Flaco Jimenez, Dembo Konte, Kausu Kuyateh, Hijaz Mustapha and Abdul Tee-Jay.  Solo career  From 1980, Holland, whilst continuing as a member of the ECBB and its successor Tiger Moth, began performing occasionally as a solo artist, singing and accompanying herself on guitar or banjo, performing a mix of modern and traditional British and American songs. She released her first solo album, Still Pause, in 1983. She also occasionally performed as a duo with Chris Coe, including a tour of the far east in 1985. Also in 1985 she was the female lead singer in the National Theatre's 3-month run of Tony Harrison's Mysteries trilogy. Holland moved from Farnham to Oxford in 1986. Holland continued to punctuate her solo career with collaborations with other artists whose work she admired.  Songwriting  In 1987 Holland began to write her first songs, encouraged by Jon Moore, one of her colleagues from Tiger Moth, with whom she had made an EP. Her writing, whilst not prolific, is of great quality, and has met with much critical acclaim. = Some notable Maggie Holland songs  \\"Perfumes of Arabia\\"  Holland wrote this in April 1991 about the Gulf War. It was first published on her 1992 album Down to the Bone. Later in the year Martin Carthy recorded it with Dave Swarbrick for their album Skin and Bone. An earlier live version sung by Martin Carthy on 17 October 1991 at Graffiti's, Pittsburg, was released in 2001 on \\"The Carthy Chronicles\\".  \\"A Proper Sort of Gardener\\"  Credited jointly with Jon Moore, this is a sentimental journey back to her childhood in Alton, the nostalgia tinged with sadness at the changes wrought on small parts of all our lives by \\"progress\\".  \\"Sandy Hill\\"  Composed while she was living in Farnham, this collaboration with Moore focuses on the fact that it is not just inner cities which have their problem areas. Her observational skills are unclouded by the sentiment which she clearly feels. \\"A Place Called England\\" The song which won Holland an award in the inaugural (2000) BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards was (in her own words)Sleeve notes to \\"Getting There\\" inspired by Christopher Hill's book \\"The World Turned Upside Down\\", Leon Rosselson's song of the same name, Naomi Mitchison's \\"Sea-Green Ribbons\\", William Cobbett's \\"Cottage Economy\\", Hamish Henderson's \\"Freedom Come-All-Ye\\", Jean Giono's \\"The Man Who Planted Trees\\" and \\"animated discussions with (rightly) proud and passionate Scots like Dick Gaughan\\". A Loughborough Folk Festival programme stated: \\"Maggie Holland is one of the most inspiring singer/songwriters in Britain today. \\"A Place Called England\\" has become emblematic in the movement to reclaim a positive sense of English identity.\\"  Recent collaborations  Maggie's Farm = With Moore and Kevin Mason she formed Maggie's Farm in 1986. The band's name is a reference to the Bob Dylan song of that name, Dylan being one of Holland's favourite songwriters. Maggie's Farm toured Bangladesh for the British Council in 1988. = Robb Johnson Band = In 1989 she began to play bass in Robb Johnson's band. Holland much admires Johnson's songwriting and has recorded a number of his works. = Derroll's Dream = During 2010 Holland participated in a project featuring the music of Derroll Adams, arranged and directed by Wiet Van Der Liest. The ensemble included seven female singers including Holland who also played 5-string banjo, a thirteen-piece chamber orchestra, guitarist Roland Van Campenhout and Wiet van de Leest on violin. They performed the programme at the Brosella, Gent and Dranouter festivals in 2010.

Building upon the run batted in (RBI) statistic, the game-winning RBI was defined in MLB rules as \\"the RBI that gives a club the lead it never relinquishes.\\" For example: A batter on the winning team brought his team ahead 3‚Äì2 from a 2‚Äì2 tie at some point during the game and his team later led 5‚Äì2 as a result of the other batters. Then, the opposing team scored two more runs, making the final score 5‚Äì4. The batter on the winning team who batted in the third run would be credited with the game-winning RBI, even though the losing team scored four runs. That the statistic \\"did not adequately distinguish the achievement it was meant to reward\\" was one of the criticisms that led to the statistic being retired. Statistically, the pitcher of the losing team who gives up the game-winning RBI is charged with a loss; the pitcher of the winning team who finished the last half-inning before the game-winning RBI is hit would be credited with the win (with certain exceptions).

Less widely known than the margarita, its structure is similarly simple, with three primary ingredients: silver or blanco tequila, pineapple juice, and lime juice. Its chief coupling of pineapple and a single spirit resembles a Jackhammer, a variant of the Screwdriver which substitutes pineapple juice for orange juice to mix with vodka. Matadors are often presented differently, either in a martini glass or a champagne flute. Background The cocktail combines three Mexican exports: tequila, pineapple and lime. Due to typically high natural sugar content in many pineapple varieties, or use of sweetened commercially produced pineapple juice, additional sweeteners are not usually added. In addition to these details, Matador is a commercial brand of tequila, though usage of a specifically branded spirit here is variable, similar to ingredient usage in other cocktails.

It was also originally called Relay Call Indicator (RCI). Originally designed along with the panel type telephone office, PCI was intended to allow subscribers in fully automated exchanges to dial numbers in manual offices the same way they dialed numbers in their own exchange. For PCI to achieve its purpose, the panel office sent the requested number to the manual office, where the number was lit on an operator's display. The switchboard operator at a PCI-aware manual office reads the number from the call indicator display and completes the call in the usual way. As a format of interoffice signaling, PCI is one of multiple options retained for compatibility in the #5 Crossbar switch, a later system which served as the platform for the initial DTMF push-button telephone services. In the British Director telephone system, Coded-Call Indicator working (CCI) filled a similar role, as it displayed dialed telephone numbers at the local manual exchange in a mixed (automatic and manual) linked-number area.http://www.samhallas.co.uk/repository/po_docs/e2_cci_working.pdf What is sent A Call Indicator on display at the Museum of Communications The usual seven-digit US telephone number consists of a three-digit office code and a four-digit line number within the given office. After a caller in a panel office dialed the office code, the sender looked up the type of the called office (panel, manual, etc.), and whether PCI was to be used. Then the sender found a trunk to the called office. Once a trunk had been found and the decision to use PCI had been made, the sender outpulsed the digits to the manual office where they were displayed for the operator. Because the operator only needed the last four digits of the phone number to complete the call, the first three dialed digits were not sent to the manual office. However, for two reasons, PCI always sends five-digit numbers rather than four (and the caller may need to dial eight digits rather than seven). The panel system was designed to work with manual offices of up to 10,500 lines. Callers dialed the office code followed by the line number within the office. For lines 10,000 and up, callers therefore dialed the office code and a five-digit line number. For offices with fewer than 10,000 lines, callers dialed four digits but PCI sends a leading 0. Also, when the panel office was designed, many people used party lines. Party line numbers were listed with a J, M, R, or W following the line number. The caller dialed the office code, the line number, and the digit corresponding to the letter. Party letters replace the ten-thousands digit described above. That is, PCI sends the letter followed by the four-digit line number. So party letters and line numbers above 10,000 can't be used together. In special cases, calls through a tandem office also used PCI signaling. This originated with manual operator tandems, and was later carried on to machine- based tandems as well. For this special tandem class, all seven dialed digits were sent to the distant office. In the case of a manual tandem, operators had a special seven segment display which displayed the entire telephone number. In later mechanical tandems, PCI was used because it was faster than revertive pulse signaling, and would thus allow for quicker call completion times. PCI encoding Digits are sent in order from most to least significant. The party letter is sent first, since it replaces the ten-thousands digit. Generally, each digit is sent as a group of four bits having the place values 1, 2, 4, and 5. This could be considered a form of biquinary code. The thousands digit is sent using binary-coded decimal, but with the 1 bit moved to the end of the group. Except for the 1 bit in the thousands digit, all bits are sent in order from least to most significant. An entire transmission uses twenty bits. Looking at the transmission another way, it consists of twenty \\"time slots\\" which may be filled by DC pulses. The first and third pulse times in a group of four contain either a positive DC current or no current. The second and fourth pulse times in a group of four contain either a light (high resistance) negative DC pulse or a heavy (low resistance) negative DC pulse. The pattern of current flow (positive, negative, positive, negative) keeps the receiver synchronized with the sender. This pattern never varies so it contains no information. The existence of a current (in the first and third pulse times) or the resistance of the current (in the second and fourth times) carries the information. In the below table, + represents a positive pulse, - represents a light negative pulse, and ‚ñ≠ represents a heavy negative pulse. Note that the thousands digit (as transmitted) is coded differently than the hundreds, tens, and units digits. 715x715px Below, is a graph of PCI pulses transmitted from the Panel switch at the Museum of Communications in Seattle. The positive and negative pulses occur on physically separate leads, but are overlaid on the same graph for simplicity, so the values of the Y axis are not absolute. Indicated on the graph are the start and end of the transmission (bottom), and the actual digits being transmitted (top).

The positive and negative pulses occur on physically separate leads, but are overlaid on the same graph for simplicity, so the values of the Y axis are not absolute.  CCI encoding  The Director telephone exchange was based on a store-and-forward handling of dialled numbers, originally with seven digit numbers. The director would receive all seven digits, use the first three to determine the destination exchange, then send the last four digits onward. For CCI working, the director would wait until the equipment at the destination was ready and then send each digit as a series of current pulses. Much like PCI signalling, each pulse had three possible levels (weak positive current, weak negative current, strong negative current) and a digit consisted of at most four pulses.

It took place in St. S√∏ren's Church (Sankt S√∏rens Kirke) in the town of Rye in eastern Jutland, where the Jutlandic nobility elected Prince Christian, son of King Frederick I and Duke of Schleswig and Holsten, as king. This brought about the Count's Feud (Grevens Fejde) and later also led to the implementation of the Protestant Reformation in Denmark and Norway. √òystein Rian. Christian 3 Norsk biografisk leksikon Christian (1503‚Äì1559) was a zealous Protestant who had witnessed the defence of Martin Luther at the Diet of Worms, and he had already carried out the Reformation in the Duchy of Holstein and Duchy of Schleswig. Christian's views made it difficult to gain the support of a majority of the Council of the Realm as most noblemen and, of course, the bishops would rather see a Roman Catholic king on the throne. Among the supporters of Christian were Steward of the Realm, Mogens G√∏ye (ca. 1470‚Äì1544). Mogens G√∏ye was a Danish statesman and the Royal councillor of several Danish Kings. G√∏ye was among the originators of the meeting in Rye Church between eight Jutlandic members of the Council and the four Jutlandic bishops. Mogens G√∏ye, Danmarks rigeste mand (Mumieklub.dk) Members of the lesser nobility had also turned up ‚Äì presumably on Mogens G√∏ye's initiative ‚Äì but had to stay outside the church. The lengthy discussion about the election eventually made them lose patience, and they forced their way into the church and demanded to know who opposed the election of Prince Christian. After that, the opponents finally gave up. Ove Bille, Bishop of Aarhus, wept when he signed the request for the Protestant Duke to become king, realising that it would mean his own downfall. Mogens G√∏ye (Den Store Danske) Although hesitant, Christian accepted the election and was cheered at a meeting in Horsens on 18 August 1534, where he declared that he would, like his predecessors, sign a h√•ndf√¶stning (charter), although with a reform of ecclesiastical affairs, i.e. the implementation of the Protestant Reformation in Denmark and Norway.Christian 3 (gravsted.dk) ReferencesOther sources *Colding, Poul Studier i Danmarks politiske historie i slutningen af Christian IIs og begyndelsen af Frederik IIs tid (Copenhagen, 1939) *Lausten, Martin Schwarz Christian 3. og kirken 1537‚Äì1559 (Copenhagen, 1987) Category:Denmark‚ÄìNorway Category:Protestant Reformation Category:1534 in Denmark Category:16th-century elections Category:1534 in politics Category:1534 in Norway ","title":"Election of Christian III"},{"id":"18762967","title":"Our Bright Future"},{"id":"18762968","text":"Zubo is a rhythm action video game developed by EA Bright Light for the Nintendo DS.

The professional teams that played at this facility included the Medford Nuggets/Rogues of the Far West League in 1948‚Äì1951 and three Northwest League teams, the Medford Giants in 1967 and 1968, the Rogue Valley/Medford Dodgers from 1969 to 1971, and the Medford/Southern Oregon A's ‚Äì Southern Oregon Timberjacks franchise from 1979 through 1999.  History  In 1951, local auto dealer Claude \\"Shorty\\" Miles (1887‚Äì1968) worked behind the scenes to help get a new baseball park built in Medford because of his unbridled passion for the sport. A suspicious fire destroyed the structure in early July, but it was quickly rebuilt. Originally known as Jackson County Baseball Park, it was rededicated as \\"Miles Field\\" in June 1969, eight months after his death It was known as \\"Jackson & Perkins Gardens at Miles Field\\" during the mid to late 1990s, because of the ballpark's relationship with Bear Creek Corporation, now the Harry & David Corporation. At the south end of the city, Miles Field was a block north of Garfield Street, between Highway 99 and Interstate 5. The elevation of the natural grass playing field was approximately above sea level and aligned east-northeast (home plate to center field), the recommended  Demise of the stadium  After 21 seasons at the venue, the Timberjacks left Medford in October 1999 for British Columbia and became the Vancouver Canadians, leaving the city without a pro baseball franchise. The field continued with use by high school and American Legion teams, and despite efforts to both raise funds to remodel the stadium and to bring in a new team to play there. It was torn down in 2004 to make way for a controversial new Walmart Super Center that was delayed and eventually opened in 2012. In 2006, Harry & David Field was constructed just down the street from the old Miles Field site. Under an agreement between the venue and the city of Medford, that field was built to accommodate youth, high school, and American Legion baseball, but not a professional team. The Miles Field site remained empty and unoccupied due to the legal battle over the site which involved the Medford City Council, Walmart, and the Medford Citizens for Responsible Development. In 2009, the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals ruled to block the project temporarily on June 4 until a traffic study was prepared. The city council appealed that ruling soon after. However, despite the MCRD's best efforts to block construction, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled in favor of Walmart in 2010 on November 18, and the new Supercenter got the go-ahead to be built. The court overturned a decision by the state's Land Use Board of Appeals to do a traffic Construction started on the new Walmart in early 2012 and was completed that summer.

The closest the Confederate States Army ever came to the area was New Mexico and eastern Kansas, each over a thousand miles away. There was not even an organized territory using \\"Montana\\" until the Montana Territory was created on May 26, 1864, three years after the Battle of Fort Sumter. In 1861, the area was divided between the Dakota Territory and the Washington Territory, and in 1863, it was part of the Idaho Territory. Nevertheless, Confederate sympathizers did have a presence in what is now the U.S. state of Montana. Those in the Montana Territory who supported the Confederate side were varied. Among them were Confederate sympathizers who were determined that some of Montana's gold would go into the Southern instead of Northern coffers. But most were those who would rather not fight in the war, which ranged from pure drifters to actual Confederate deserters.Sargent, Tom. Lincoln's Vulnerable Treasure Chest, The Civil War in Montana (Virginia City Preservation Alliance, 1999) Varina Davis In southwest Montana, Madison County residents of the area native to the Southeast United States wished to name their new town Varina, in honor of Varina Davis, the wife of the Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The Varina Townsite Company, on June 16, 1863, went to confirm the of land as the town of Varina. However, when they applied for the name, the judge--Connecticut native Dr. G.G. Bissell-- refused, saying they would be \\"damned\\" before he would allow the town to be named for the first lady of the Confederacy. Bissell did say he would allow the company to name the town after the state of Virginia, and they did so, incorporating the town of Virginia City. Charles Dickens even mentioned it in his book All the Year Round.Dickens, Charles. All the Year Round. 1868. p. 60. The town would remain sympathetic to the South, even after being named the capital of Montana. When boats sailed down the Yellowstone River from the town (this is manifestly wrong, since the Yellowstone River does not even penetrate Madison County, much less flow through Virginia City), the local newspaper said they were sailing to \\"America.\\"Cromie, Alice. (Well, this is clearly wrong, since the Yellowstone River does NOT lie anywhere near Virginia City) A Tour Guide to the Civil War (Rutledge Hill Press, 1992) pg.171,172Dimsdale, Thomas. The Vigilantes of Montana (University of Oklahoma Press, 1977) pg.72 The loyalty towards the Confederacy concerned many supporters of the Union. Seeing this, Sidney Edgerton in 1863 went quickly to see Abraham Lincoln about the situation, and this was one impetus to create the Montana Territory so quickly.Sargent, Tom. The Commanding Officers in Montana, The Civil War in Montana. Virginia City Preservation Alliance, 1999. Gold mining in Montana began during the Civil War; gold placer deposits were discovered at Bannack in 1862. The resulting gold rush resulted in more placer discoveries, including those at Virginia City in 1863 and at Helena and Butte in 1864.Koschman, A. H., and M. H. Bergendahl. Principal Gold-Producing Districts of the United States (Professional Paper 610). United States Geological Survey, 1968, p.143. Gold from the Montana gold mines went to both sides of the conflict.Sargent, Tom. The Economics of the Civil War, The Civil War in Montana (Virginia City Preservation Alliance, 1999) In Broadwater County, in the central portion of the state, Confederate sympathizers found a vein of gold eight miles (13 km) west of Townsend, with the immediate area named \\"Confederate Gulch\\" in their honor. It was said to be among the \\"largest and richest of the placer diggings\\" within the state.Cromie, p. 172.Dimsdale, p. 244.  Civil War Regiments in Montana Territory  Although no organized Confederate forces reached Montana Territory, a series of union regiments, most of which were raised to fight confederates in the south, instead found themselves far to the west of the Civil War, fighting Native Americans and guarding outposts in Montana Territory.

Biography=Early life, ordination and ministry Joseph Fox was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to Paul and Frances (n√©e Bartel) Fox, who were German immigrants. He received his early education at the parochial school of the Cathedral of St. Francis Xavier in his native city. He made his classical studies at St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee from 1870 to 1875. He then studied philosophy and theology at the American College of Louvain in Belgium. While in Belgium, he was ordained to the priesthood on June 7, 1879. Fox's first assignment, following his return to Wisconsin, was as pastor of St. Kilian Church in New Franken, where he remained for eight months. He afterwards served at St. John the Baptist Church in Green Bay for three years, in addition to serving as secretary to Bishop Francis Krautbauer. In 1883, he became pastor of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Marinette, serving there for eleven years. He served as vicar general of the diocese from 1894 to 1904, and was named a domestic prelate by Pope Leo XIII in 1898. Bishop of Green Bay, Wisconsin On May 27, 1904, Fox was appointed the fifth Bishop of Green Bay by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 25 from Archbishop Sebastian Messmer, with Bishops William Stang and Frederick Eis serving as co-consecrators. He was the first and only native son of the diocese to become its bishop. During his tenure, he built a new episcopal residence, which later became the diocesan chancery (now demolished), and displayed a strong interest in education and advancing the parochial school system.

They founded their own label, Unique Leader Records, which has since become home to a number of other death metal bands from around the world. Deeds of Flesh have released eight studio albums, their most recent being Portals to Canaan which was released in 2013. Overview=Brief history Deeds of Flesh formed in 1993. They signed to Wild Rags Records and released their first EP, entitled Gradually Melted. They then moved labels to the now- defunct Repulse Records, and released their first full-length album, entitled Trading Pieces, in 1996. Two years later, in 1998, they released a second album, entitled Inbreeding the Anthropophagi, on the same label, this time with Brad Palmer replacing Joey Heaslet on drums. After this album was recorded, guitarist Jim Tkacz joined the band. The band then lost their contract with the label and self-released a demo. After this, they decided to form their own label Unique Leader Records. All their subsequent records were released on this label. The band then released a DVD called Deeds of Flesh: Live In Montreal in 2005. In 2007, founding member and bassist Jacoby Kingston announced he was leaving the band, due to lifestyle changes. He was replaced by Erlend Caspersen. In Summer 2012, Erik Lindmark was diagnosed with tendonitis, leading to a touring hiatus. The band's eighth full-length, Portals to Canaan was released on June 25, 2013. On November 29, 2018, frontman Erik Lindmark died from sclerosis at the age of 46. On September 28, 2020, the band announced a new album, Nucleus, which will be released on December 11. It will be the band's first album without frontman Erik Lindmark, though it will feature music Lindmark wrote and recorded prior to his death. It was also announced that former bassist and vocalist Jacoby Kingston had ended his retirement and rejoined the band solely as vocalist, while former drummer Mike Hamilton also contributed to the album. In addition, it will also feature guest vocals from many established death metal vocalists, including Luc Lemay of Gorguts, John Gallagher of Dying Fetus, George \\"Corpsegrinder\\" Fisher of Cannibal Corpse, Frank Mullen of Suffocation, Matti Way of Disgorge, Bill Robinson of Decrepit Birth, Anthony Trapani of Odious Mortem, Obie Flett of Pathology, Robbe Kok of Disavowed, Dusty Boisjolie of Severed Savior, and Jon Zig of Serpentian. Tours Deeds of Flesh has toured extensively over the past decade. After the release of Mark of the Legion, the band supported Monstrosity on the \\"Bloodletting North America Pt. II\\" Tour. A year later, in 2002, they would tour with Disgorge and Dutch death metallers Severe Torture and Disavowed on the Bloodletting North America Part III tour. The band also performed a number of shows with Cannibal Corpse. 2004 found the band touring with such widely known American death metal acts as Dying Fetus and Hate Eternal. They also toured Australia with Tasmanian death metal group Psycroptic. After sitting out much of 2005 due to injuries to Jacoby Kingston and Mike Hamilton, the band started touring again in 2006. They toured Europe alongside Monstrosity, Vile, and Impaled, then toured North America with Decrepit Birth, Vile, and Odious Mortem. Musical style Their music can be described as influenced by the brutal death metal style pioneered by Suffocation and the technical approach of bands like Morbid Angel and Cannibal Corpse coupled with a songwriting style that incorporates numerous abrupt changes in meter and tempo, creating a disorienting atmosphere to the listener. The guitar riffs themselves tend to be atonal, albeit often minor or diminished, mixtures of palm-muting, fast tremolo picking, and breakdowns. The drum parts also change frequently, mirroring the constantly shifting nature of the guitar lines. The vocals are a mixture of low growls and high screams. On former albums, the low-pitched vocals were performed by Lindmark, and the high-pitched vocals by Kingston. After Kingston's departure, Lindmark undertook all vocal duties before his death on November 29, 2018. Deeds of Flesh did not implement guitar solos until their 2008 release Of What's to Come, on which there are many, performed by then-new guitarist Sean Southern. Their lyrical content deals with themes common to death metal, such as death, murder, disease, and horror. Of What's To Come was a stylistic departure from this as a concept album that dealt with post-apocalyptic and science fiction themes.

Stephens, M (et al.), Handbook of Australian Livestock, Australian Meat & Livestock Export Corporation, 2000 (4th ed), Characteristics Adaptaur cattle are early maturing and of a medium size with a short dark red pigmented coat and good resistance to internal parasites. Some Adaptaurs carry a gene that produces extremely high resistance to cattle ticks and the Australian Hereford Society is assisting to increase frequency of the gene by embryo transfer. It is capable of producing substantial hybrid vigor when used for crossbreeding. The F1 progeny grow faster and are more fertile than Brahmans.

It is found in Costa Rica, Brazil, Venezuela; Colombia; Ecuador; Suriname; French Guiana; Guyana; Panama; Trinidad, and Peru. They have a small thumb which is included in the membrane of the wing, causing the 'thumbless' appearance.  Taxonomy  The thumbless bat belongs to the family Furipteridae (Mammalia: Chiroptera) which is currently composed of only two genera: Amorphochilus and Furipterus. Both genera are monotypic. The first description of the species was proposed by Fr√©d√©ric Cuvier in 1828, separating the taxon to a new genus Furia. The taxon was reassigned to Furipterus in 1839 by Charles Bonaparte.  Geographic range  The thumbless bat is found in Central and South America. Its range includes Costa Rica, Panama, southern Brazil and Bolivia (Gardner 2008, Peracchi et al. 2011). In Brazil, it was recorded in 12 different regions covering the Amazon, Caatinga, Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes (Reis and Gazarini 2007, Tavares et al. 2008, Peracchi et al. 2011).  Population  Its populations are rare and very local, but widespread. Male and female bats may live separately during some parts of the year. There were found more than 60 males occupying one hollow.  Habitat  The thumbless bat is found in caves. Additionally, it is associated with moist environments. Thumbless bats were detected significantly more frequently over large lakes(Emmons and Feer 1997). The moist habitat plays a key role for aerial insectivorous bats. However, thumbless bat's activity is significantly higher in forest compared to the lakes. They roots in small clusters in colonies for up to 60 individuals in caves. The nests are located in deep cracks between rocks.  Diet  Thumbless bats are aerial insectivorous bats.

Biography  Maniu was born in 1833 in Szil√°gybadacsony, Kingdom of Hungary, now the village of BƒÉdƒÉcin, in Pericei commune, SƒÉlaj County, Romania. He studied law in Pest and Vienna. Maniu was deeply influenced by his uncle, Simion BƒÉrnu»õiu. At the age of 6, in 1839, he started to study at »òimleu Silvaniei, the courses for the Franciscan minority gymnasium, where he graduated from the elementary school and 4 lower secondary classes. He spent 8 years under the strict discipline of the monks. In this place he met the vicar Alexandru Sterca-»òulu»õiu and the Romanian language teacher Andrei Liviu Pop, who would later influence his life. In the fall of 1849, he went to the Romanian schools in Blaj, where he was enrolled in the fifth grade. As a student in Blaj, Maniu lived very hard, with the \\"scream\\" (the Metropolis had shared free bread to the poor students) and also, they were given the poor \\"zeama\\" (the chicken soup) for free from the kitchen of the Theological Seminary, where on a daily basis the cooks made the soup for the poor students. In 1850 he came home on Easter holiday, but due to shortages, he had to quit school. He remained here until his former teacher, Andrei Liviu Pop, intervened, telling his mother Ileana that it would be a shame for the boy to stay home, a peasant, seeing his excellent grades. From the annual reports of the high school it was observed that, in grades VI-VIII (there were missing those of the fifth grade), but the student Maniu was among the first, related to the marks and behavior. Starting with the 7th grade, uncle BƒÉrnu»õiu was able to send some modest help. One of his very good colleagues and friends was Ioan Micu Moldovan, who remained to the death his friend and the counselor of the family, passing the old friendship especially on Iuliu Maniu, who, at his proposal, was appointed the lawyer of the Metropolitan Church of Blaj. He married in 1865 Clara Coroian, the daughter of the Greek-Catholic clergyman Demetriu Coroian. They had five children: Cassiu, Iuliu, Sabina, Cornelia, and Elena. Their second child, Iuliu Maniu, was a politician. He died in 1895 in his native village of BƒÉdƒÉcin.  Family  He was born on September 10, 1833 in a Romanian family (Greek-Catholic), being the son of Teodor Man and Ilena BƒÉrnu»õiu, the sister of the revolutionary Simion BƒÉrnu»õiu. Teodor Man was a peasant-nobleman from Badacin, one of the descendants of Lauren»õiu Man. In a letter to his uncle, Simion BƒÉrnu»õiu, of March 10, 1861, Ioan Maniu, had made his self-description, in which he said that he is tall, \\"only that I am thin and not fat like my father\\". Teodor Man died in his prime due to pneumonia, which he contracted while working on the construction of his own house. Ioan Maniu was only 2 years old when his father died. Ileana BƒÉrnu»õiu was the daughter of teacher and singer Ioan BƒÉrnu»õiu, married to Ana Oros from Boc»ôa. Ioan Barnutiu was the son of the united Roman priest Simion BƒÉrnu»õiu from Boc»ôa, the latter was also a son of a priest, and his father was also called Simion BƒÉrnu»õiu. In the letter that Ioan Maniu addressed to his uncle, Simion BƒÉrnu»õiu, on October 30, 1855, he wrote: \\"You are the replica of your mother, the only thing that the Mother‚Äôs face was drier and paler than yours.\\" In another letter Ioan Maniu also said to his uncle: ‚ÄúI have another growth by the years of 16th, I had nothing but my mother who gave her sweet words. Another example of virtue I had was only her gentle behavior, her noble heart, which all man marveled at.\\" Ileana BƒÉrnu»õiu died in 1854‚Äì1855. Teodor Man and Ilena BƒÉrnu»õiu had three children: Ioan, Sofia (married to Teodor Man, economist form BƒÉdƒÉcin), and »òtefan.

Together with Christel Rijnten she won the bronze medal. The following year Dekker became World Junior Champion in the four with Rijnten, Karin Klinge and Maartje Breeman in Glasgow. In 1997 she finished fifth in the single scull race at the Junior World Championships in Hazewinkel. She kept on rowing the single scull in 1998 with winning a bronze medal in the Nations Cup. In 1999 in the double sculls with Annemieke Klaren she was unsuccessful. Dekker and Marloes Bolman qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and became 10th in the coxless pairs. In 2001, she formed a fours boat with Anneke Venema, Hurnet Dekkers and Carin ter Beek that finished fourth and fifth at the Rowing World Cup meetings in Sevilla and Munich. At the World Championships in Luzern with Christine Vink as a replacement of Hurnet Dekkers they won the bronze medal in the coxless fours. 2002 was a disappointing year for Dekker as she only reached two fourth places in World Cup meetings with Marlies Smulders, Nienke Hommes and Melina Bus in the fours. At the World Championships they could only reach to an eighth position. The double sculls season in 2003 with Froukje Wegman was even more disappointing as not one single A-final was reached. She decided to row on her own in 2004 and to aim to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics. In the single scull she became fifth and third in World Cup meetings, which secured her spot in Athens, but at the Olympics itself she only was able to finish in tenth position. In 2005 it was time to start with the newly born Dutch eights project. The team existing of Dekker, Sanne Beukers, Nienke Hommes, Hurnet Dekkers, Annemarieke van Rumpt, Laura Posthuma, Annemiek de Haan, Helen Tanger and cox Ester Workel managed to row to the second spot at the World Cup meeting in Munich straight away. With Marlies Smulders instead of Hommes they reached the same spot in Luzern. Hommes returned to the team instead of Smulders for the World Championships, while Beukers was replaced by Nienke Dekkers. This team dropped down one place and won the bronze medal. In 2006 Dekker remained in the eights, but at the World Championships in Eton she performed in the coxless fours with Posthuma, Nienke Kingma and Roline Repelaer van Driel to finish in fifth. She returned to the eights in 2007 rowing to two third positions in the World Cup in Linz and Luzern as well as the first place in Amsterdam with Jacobine Veenhoven, Smulders, Hurnet Dekkers, Van Rumpt, Repelaer van Driel, Sarah Siegelaar, De Haan and Workel. Then at the World Championships in Munich the team failed to achieve the A-final and had to be satisfied with the 7th position overall. In 2008 the team tried to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics and at the first World Cup in Munich Veenhoven was replaced by Nienke Dekkers while Hurnet Dekkers was replaced by Nienke Kingma; they finished in fourth position. Helen Tanger replaced Nienke Dekkers in the second meeting held in Luzern and another fourth position was achieved. This also meant the Olympic qualification was accomplished.

He was an officer in the King's Royal Rifle Corps and Royal Engineers. Templer set out a scientific foundation for British military ballooning. In particular, he worked out routines for balloon handling, how to use hydrogen in cylinders and methods for training observers. Biography James Templer was the son of John Templer. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. Whilst serving in the King's Royal Rifle Corps Templer became interested in military ballooning. In 1878 Captain Templer and Captain C M Watson started the first regular British Army balloon school at Woolwich. The school was started with Templer's own balloon, the Crusader. At the same time, Templer was appointed Instructor in Ballooning to the Royal Engineers. The following year Captain Templer took command of the newly established military balloon department at Chatham. On 10 December 1881 Captain Templer was accompanied by Walter Powell the MP for Malmesbury and Mr. A. Agg-Gardner, brother of James Agg-Gardner ‚Äì then between terms as MP for Cheltenham ‚Äì in the balloon Saladin. The group departed Bath and headed towards Dorset. In time they found themselves within half a mile of the sea near Eypesmouth which is to the west of Bridport. As the balloon was rapidly drifting seaward, they attempted to descend. The balloon touched the ground a mere 150 yards from the cliff edge. The balloon dragged along and ground and Templer exited the basket holding the valve line in his hand. As the balloon had just been lightened, it rose about eight feet and Agg-Gardner jumped out breaking his leg. Powell was now the only occupant of the balloon. Templer, who had still hold of the line, shouted to Powell to climb down the line. Powell made a move for the rope but the balloon rose, tearing the line out of Templer's hands. The balloon climbed rapidly and Powell was taken out to sea. He was never seen again. In February 1885, Templer was promoted to the rank of major. During the British Army's expedition to the Sudan in 1885, Templer took three balloons. He was mentioned in despatches for his actions during the Hasheen engagement. In 1888 Templer was accused, arrested and charged with providing the Italian Government with British secrets about military ballooning. The case was found to be without foundation and Templer was honourably acquitted. At the start of the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), Templer served in the Scientific and Departmental Corps as a lieutenant colonel. He was promoted to full colonel in the Reserve of Officers on 6 December 1899, and was able to put his interest in steam traction to use when he served as Director of Steam Road Transport during the war. He was mentioned in despatches (29 November 1900) by Lord Roberts, Commander-in-Chief during the early part of the War. After the end of the war, Templer retired from his commission in the 7th (Militia) Battalion of the King‚Ä≤s Royal Rifle Corps in November 1902. The Airship Nulli Secundus, 1907 In 1902, Templer decided that it was time to construct a British military airship. Under Templer's direction, in 1905 the Balloon Factory relocated to Farnborough. where work could be started on an airship shed. This, and a shortage of money, delayed the project. Work on the British Army Dirigible No 1, named Nulli Secundus (\\"Second to none\\") was not complete until 1907 by which time Templer was no longer the superintendent of the Balloon Factory, Colonel Capper having taken over in 1906. Templer continued as the superintendent of the Balloon Factory until retiring from service in 1908. He died at Laughton Grange in the Sussex town of Lewes on 2 January 1924. Family Templer married Florence Henrietta Gilliat at Chorley Wood in Watford on 12 January 1889. Their daughter Ursula Florence Templer was born in London the following year on 29 August 1890.

Aaron Motsoaledi is the current Minister of Home Affairs.https://ewn.co.za/2018/11/13/ramaphosa-appoints-blade-nzimande-as- acting-home-affairs-minister/  Duties  The department is responsible for: * Maintenance of the National Population Register (the civil registry), including the recording of births, marriages/civil partnerships and deaths. * Issuing identity documents and passports. * Issuing visas for visitors to South Africa (although visa applications pass through embassies or consulates which are part of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation). * Managing immigration to South Africa and naturalization of permanent immigrants. * Handling refugees and asylum seekers in South Africa. * Controlling ports of entry at land borders, seaports and airports. Budget In the 2010 national budget, the department received an appropriation of 5,719.6 million rand, and had 9,375 employees. Criticisms=Extremely Poor Service The department has been criticized for its inefficiency, particularly in regard to processing documents. Eye Witness News reported that it will take two years to process visa requests from Zimbabwe citizens applying for work and study permits. In another case, The Sowetan reports that as South African citizen has unsuccessfully tried to attain an identity document for four years . There have also been reports of the incompetency of the officers themselves. For instance some of them do not even know the relevant documents that need to be submitted for a particular visa application. In some scenarios, 2 identical applicants submitting the exact documents for the exact visa might not get the same response. One might be refused while the other one might be approved. Some applicants might have their applications rejected several times, either because they are only being informed of the relevant documents to be submitted each time their applications get rejected or the Home Affairs officials processing the documents are themselves not aware of the immigration rules of the country and thus a well completed application that deserved to be approved might still be rejected. It is not surprising that a straightforward application might take up to 2 years to be processed, while ideally in an effective system, they would be processed in a couple of months at worst. The consequences of such inefficiency can be worrying. Many foreigners thus often find themselves working illegally or even losing their bread winning job, simply because the system takes too long to process their visas. Harshness on Applicants Communication is also a major issue. Apart from the call centre, where the operators can provide technical advise with regards to lodging complaints, follow ups on applications and referring a complaint or question to the \\" Right Person\\" , there is actually no efficient way of contacting the actual immigration officers themselves, especially when it comes to getting explanation and professional advises on delicate matters. Phone calls usually go unanswered. Emails sent to the designated immigration officers also go unswered most of the time. If a phone call or an email ever get answered, the applicant usually gets told that his complaint or request will be referred to the \\"Right Person\\" and that an immigration officer will contact him in due time. It turns out that most of the time the applicant never gets called back. What usually follows is that the applicant usually phone again or send a new email only to have a totally new person attending to him ( if he is lucky enough ), to whom the applicant will have to reexplain his entire problem. This vicious cycle usually goes on for a long time to the point that some applicants actually give up because of the harshness of the system. Corruption There have been numerous reports of corruption within Home Affairs. In February 2010 the department closed one of its Johannesburg offices due to corruption. A number of officials and staff members have appeared in court for alleged corruption and bribery . Allegations include the sale of fake passports. Mismanagement In May 2010 it was reported that the Department of Home Affairs had not paid its bill to the Government Printing Works, leading to a delay in the issuance of new passports.\\"DA statement on Home affairs's R126million debt to GPW\\", From the Old, http://fromtheold.com/news/da-statement-home-affairss-r126million-debt- gpw-2010031016905.html , 10 March 2010 Home Affairs is facing lawsuits of R 5 billion for various breaches of terms and contracts.

Following his graduation from Baylor and marriage to Kathryn Buffington, Miller entered the Metropolitan Urban Study Program in New York City directed by Bill Webber of East Harlem Protestant Parish. While participating in the study program, Miller also worked for WCBS NewsRadio 880. In 1968, the Millers moved to Austin, Texas where Miller served as an associate minister of First Baptist Church. It was there in March, 1969 that Miller met Peter, Paul and Mary and convinced them to allow him to make a documentary of their music and activism. That documentary, called The Song is Love, was among the first films made on Peter, Paul and Mary. The film, shot and directed by Tobe Hooper, aired on PBS for ten years starting in Easter 1970. The Song is Love was a major fund- raising event for PBS during the seventies.http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74947 Miller then began developing curriculum for the Texas Education Agency, using role-playing games and short ‚Äútrigger‚Äù films to teach Career Education. During the seventies, Miller assisted Warren Skaaren in starting the Texas Film Commission. Miller also began developing feature films with John Heyman of World Film Services, Inc. Career Filmmaker Al Reinert approached Miller in 1986 to assist in completing one of Reinert‚Äôs projects, For All Mankind. The film documents the Apollo missions from 1968 to 1972. In 1989, For All Mankind was selected as the Audience Favorite and the Grand Jury Winner at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award. The film participated in many major film festivals in 1989 and 1990.http://www.criterion.com/ASP/release.asp?id=54 In the early 1990s, Miller and a team of educators and sociologists designed a program for IBM called ‚ÄúThe Advancement of Women.‚Äù Miller chose Rosabeth Kanter‚Äôs classic male and female stereotypes as the basis for humorous ‚Äútrigger‚Äù videos. In addition to producing and directing the five videos, called ‚ÄúPerceptions‚Äù, Miller traveled to many of the IBM plants facilitating two-day workshops for IBM executives. Texas Entertainment News! was founded by Miller in 1995 to combine broadcast television and Internet streaming. Though the show was top-rated, the lack of broadband users in 1995 prevented its growth and it was canceled after one season. That same year Miller received the W. R. White Meritorious Service Award from Baylor University. In 1999 Miller joined Lloyd Walker at Human Code, Inc., a digital-content studio that built web sites, developed computer games and created broadband programming. Human Code was eventually sold to Sapient. In 2000, Miller produced and directed A Most Significant Journey, one of the first high definition traveling showcases presented in major cities across America. The 35-minute HD show gave a first hand look of what it was like to be a student at Baylor University in 2000. The Comical Sense Company (now The Trevor Romain Company) was founded by Miller, Trevor Romain and Woody Englander in 2003 with the goal of promoting social and emotional fitness for elementary school children through animated programming. The Trevor Romain Show is seen on PBS. Some of the awards it has received are: Cine Golden Eagle, a top Telly, and the Oppenheim Gold DVD Award. Miller retired from the company in 2007. Miller, along with producers Elizabeth Avell√°n and Shannon McIntosh, recently produced Turk Pipkin's Christmas novel When Angels Sing as a feature film under the title Angels Sing. The movie stars Harry Connick, Jr., Connie Britton, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and Lyle Lovett. Tim McCanlies is the director. The movie was released in theaters by Lionsgate. In 2018, Miller wrapped production on the feature film When We Last Spoke,https://www.toccoagachamber.com/blog/2018/8/30/when-we-last-spoke- movie-5-in-toccoa-stephens-county based on the novel of the same name by Marci Henna.https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30623136-when-we-last-spoke The movie stars Melissa Gilbert, Corbin Bernsen and Oscar and Emmy-winner Cloris Leachman,https://www.emmys.com/bios/cloris-leachman among others.

Rivers of the Lower Tanana Management Area, \\"Minto Flats\\" Accessed August 7, 2008. The Chatanika is thus a portion of the Yukon River drainage basin. During the first portion of the 20th century, the Chatanika was dominated by the gold- mining industry, which used its flow to operate gold dredges. The most visible example of this was the construction of the Davidson Ditch, a dam-and-pipeline system used to divert water to gold-mining operations closer to Fairbanks. The Ditch was abandoned in the 1950s, and during the 1967 Tanana Valley flood, the dam was damaged and became inoperable. In January 2002, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service removed the dam in conjunction with other groups, restoring the Chatanika's original flow.Florida Museum of Natural History.

Today, the upper Chatanika is a moderately popular rafting and fishing destination, and vacation cabins have been built at spots along its banks. Chatanika, Alaska, located near the river, shares its name with the river. The river contains Arctic grayling, Arctic lamprey, burbot, chum salmon, humpback whitefish, king salmon, least cisco, longnose suckers, northern pike, sheefish, and slimy sculpins. Boating Boaters can float the Chatanika River in many kinds of non-motorized watercraft. The Elliott Highway, which crosses the river below the village of Chatanika, and the Steese Highway, which parallels the river further upstream, offer multiple places to begin and end boating trips. Several public campgrounds and waysides along these highways afford access to the river. The entire river is rated Class I (easy) on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Dangers include logjams and overhanging trees and stumps. Parks The Upper Chatanika River State Recreation Site is at mile 39 of the Steese Highway. It is a relatively small park at .

Poitier also stars in the film alongside Harry Belafonte and Ruby Dee. This is the first film Sidney Poitier directed. Vincent Canby of The New York Times said Poitier \\"showed a talent for easy, unguarded, rambunctious humor missing from his more stately movies\\". This film broke Hollywood Western traditions by casting black actors as central characters and portraying both tension and solidarity between African Americans and Native Americans in the late 19th century. The notable blues musicians Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, and Don Frank Brooks performed in the film's soundtrack, composed by jazz great Benny Carter. Plot Set in the late 1860s in the Kansas Territory shortly after the American Civil War, Buck and the Preacher follows a former soldier named Buck (Sidney Poitier) as he leads wagon trains of African Americans from Louisiana west to the unsettled territories of Kansas. In order to ensure safe passage and food for his company, Buck negotiates with the Native Americans in the area. He pays them, and in turn they allow him to kill limited numbers of buffalo to eat, and to pass through their land providing they do it quickly. A group of violent white men are hired by plantation owners in Louisiana to raid the African American wagon trains and settlements to either scare them back to Louisiana or kill them. The raiders attempt to kill Buck by setting a trap at his home. However, warned by his wife, Ruth (Ruby Dee), he escapes. While in flight he chances across Reverend Willis Oaks Rutherford (Harry Belafonte), a shady individual masquerading as a preacher, and forces the Reverend to switch horses with him. Although the Preacher initially had a desire to get even with Buck, he changes his mind and decides to work with Buck after seeing the carnage the white raiders inflict on the African American travelers. Buck, Ruth and the Preacher do whatever it takes to get the wagon train west, including ambushing some of the raiders in a brothel, robbing a bank, and when necessary taking on the entire band of raiders going up against them.Buck and the Preacher, 1972, dir. Sidney Poitier Cast * Sidney Poitier as Buck * Harry Belafonte as The Preacher * Ruby Dee as Ruth * Cameron Mitchell as Deshay * Denny Miller as Floyd * Nita Talbot as Madame Esther * John Kelly as Sheriff * Tony Brubaker as Headman * Bobby Johnson as Man Who Is Shot * James McEachin as Kingston * Clarence Muse as Cudjo * Lynn Hamilton as Sarah * Doug Johnson as Sam * Errol John as Joshua * Jullie Robinson as Sinsie * Enrique Lucero as Indian chief Production background Buck and the Preacher was one of the first films directed by an African American and to be based on a band of African Americans fighting against the White majority. Poitier directed the film and it was produced by Belafonte Enterprises, Columbia Pictures Corporation, and E & R Productions Corp. The film was filmed in Durango, Mexico, as well as in Kenya. It was released in the United States in 1972. Poitier wasn‚Äôt originally slated as the director of the film. Joseph Sargent, who was known for being a western director, left the project because of some disagreements he had with some of the cast. Even though this would be the first feature he directed, Poitier assumed the role of director. It took Poitier 45 days to shoot the film, and he edited the film during the shooting of The Organization, in which he starred. In regards to how Poitier felt directing, he stated, ‚ÄúI rolled my camera for the first time. I tell you, after three or four takes of that first scene, a calm came over me. A confidence surged through my whole body‚Ä¶ and I, as green as I was, had a touch for this new craft I had been courting from a distance for many, many years.‚Äù  Themes = Civil rights  Civil rights themes can be seen throughout the film. Many allegorical parallels can be drawn between the film's plot and the main tenets of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. The violence of the marauders preventing the former slaves from settling their own land parallels the housing and property ownership issues of the 1960s. Additionally, the film comments on the systemic racism of the twentieth century by depicting a conversation between the leader of the marauders and a sheriff. Essentially, the point of the conversation is to illustrate that although there are laws in place to prevent racism and violence, the lack of enforcement of those laws makes them useless, in effect. The film also has themes shared by other Blaxploitation films in regards to its depiction of white people and how they interact with African Americans. Not only does the film depict white people as being sadistic, there is a specific scene in which Preacher uses a racist stereotype to fool the night riders into a sense of comfort. He improvises an over-the-top sermon to get the white men to laugh and let their guards down, and as soon as they do, Buck enters and kills everyone at the table. This usage of racist stereotypes by oppressed people can be seen in other Black Power films such as The Spook Who Sat by the Door.  Exodusters  Following the Civil War, around 1879, African Americans in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee fled to Kansas seeking work and new lives away from the South. These migrants are known as ‚ÄúExodusters.‚Äù While there was work for them in the South and slavery had technically ended, the powerful white leaders of Southern states did all they could to prevent African Americans from owning land. These lawmakers also created sharecropping which, in effect, continued slavery. Also, the Exodusters had no interest in sharecropping or growing cotton or other cash crops for the white people who were once slave owners. The work they sought in Kansas was subsistence farming. With the independence of African Americans in the South came a violent reaction from Southern whites. The scarce law enforcement of rural areas mixed with Confederates‚Äô bitterness about their loss of the Civil War, which was frequently blamed on African Americans, lead to groups of former Confederate soldiers raiding settlements of former slaves trying to make their own way. These marauders would steal supplies, horses, food, and destroy anything they didn‚Äôt take. This violence only gave the Exodusters more reason to flee to Kansas. Release The film was screened October 30, 1971 at Loew's Theatre in Richmond, Virginia for the benefit of Virginia Union University in what was originally billed as its world premiere but later referred to as a preview by Poitier to avoid the film being reviewed.  Reception  According to Poitier, the film was not an immediate success financially. The film was made on a budget of $2 million and Poitier claimed that it broke even at the box office. In fact, the poor financial reception resulted in Poitier losing a film deal with Columbia Pictures. Critics were somewhat split in their reviews. Gordon Gow, a critic for Films and Filming, said that the movie was ‚Äúbreezy stuff and highly entertaining.‚Äù He went on to say that Belafonte‚Äôs performance was humorous even though it was somewhat over-the-top for the overall historical realism that the film is going for. Other reviews were not so positive. Writers for Motion Picture Guide focused more on the negative stereotypes presented in the film. ‚ÄúStereotypes abound in this foolish, witless western, a production misusing the fine black talent in its cast.\\" The initial lackluster response from audiences may have been caused by how different Buck is than typical Blaxploitation heroes such as Shaft and Coffy who live in contemporary society. The old west setting may have been too far removed from the African American audiences viewing the film. Additionally, the fact that white heroes were typically the centerpieces of American westerns may have also contributed to the foreignness of the film to its target audience.

The North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, formally known as the Convention between the United States and Other Powers Providing for the Preservation and Protection of Fur Seals, was a treaty signed on July 7, 1911, designed to manage the commercial harvest of fur-bearing mammals (such as Northern fur seals and sea otters) in the Pribilof Islands of the Bering Sea. The treaty, signed by the United States, Great Britain (also representing Canada), Japan, and Russia, outlawed open-water seal hunting and acknowledged the United States' jurisdiction in managing the on-shore hunting of seals for commercial purposes. It was the first international treaty to address wildlife preservation issues. Terms of the treaty The fur seal's range. All pelagic sealing north of the 30th parallel in the Pacific Ocean was banned by the treaty. The two most significant terms of the treaty were the banning of pelagic seal hunting and the granting of jurisdiction to the United States in managing on-shore hunts.Bailey (1935), p. 13. In exchange for granting jurisdiction to the United States, the other signatories to the treaty were guaranteed payments and/or minimum takes of seal furs while the treaty remained in effect, subject to certain conditions. The treaty also provided an exemption to aboriginal tribes which hunted seals using traditional methods and for non-commercial purposes including food and shelter. Aboriginal tribes specifically mentioned in the treaty include the Aleut and Aino (Ainu) peoples. Authorship and ratification The treaty was co-authored by environmentalist Henry Wood Elliott and United States Secretary of State John Hay in 1905, although the treaty was not signed for another six years. The treaty was signed at Washington, on July 7, 1911, with ratifications by each signatory on the following dates: *United States: Ratification advised by the Senate on July 24, 1911, and ratified by President William Howard Taft on November 24, 1911 *Great Britain: August 25, 1911 *Russia: October 22 / November 4, 1911 *Japan: November 6, 1911 Ratifications were then exchanged at Washington on December 12, 1911, and the treaty was proclaimed two days later on December 14. Enactment and legacy Following ratification, the U.S. Congress enacted an immediate five-year moratorium on hunting, to allow for recovery of the decimated herds. The treaty remained in effect until hostilities erupted among the signatories in World War II. However, the treaty set precedent for future national and international laws and treaties, including the Fur Seal Act of 1966 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. On the 100th anniversary of the treaty in 2011, the Pribilof Fur Seal Monument was erected.

It extends along Great Road between Bacon and Concord Roads, and includes primarily residential areas on adjacent side streets. The area includes the town's main civic buildings, its first cemetery, and a diverse array of residential architecture spanning more than two centuries. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977; its boundaries were adjusted in 2014 and its period of significance extended. Description and history The area that is now Bedford was settled in the 17th century, and was first incorporated as part of Billerica in 1655 before being separately incorporated in 1729, including a portion of neighboring Concord. The town's civic center was at the time of incorporation established near its geographic center, with a colonial meeting house built in 1730 on land donated by early settler Israel Putnam. Its network of major roads developed in part out of early roads connecting Concord and Billerica, with Great Road laid out sometime between 1713 and 1731. The town's first cemetery was established just to its north in 1729, and was the town's only cemetery until 1849. The oldest building in the district is the Fitch Tavern, built 1710. Most of the buildings in the district were built in the 18th and 19th centuries; there are some modern intrusions, but they are generally stylistically compatible. The centerpiece of the district is Bedford's First Parish Church, a Federal-style church built in 1816, which faces the town common. Also facing the common is Bedford's town hall, which was built in 1857 as a school, and has seen a variety of civic uses before housing town offices. When the district was listed on the National Register in 1977, its period of significance extended to 1927; in 2014, the district underwent boundary adjustments that increased its size by , and extended its period of significance to 1967.

The original 1874 depot and 1877 freight house are listed on the National Register of Historic Places; along with a restored Budd Rail Diesel Car, they form the centerpieces of the Bedford Depot Park. History=Early service The Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad was built to what is now Lexington Center in 1845‚Äì46, and bought by the Boston and Lowell Railroad in 1870 in order to prevent the line from building an alternate route to Lowell via Bedford. In August 1873, the subsidiary Middlesex Central Railroad opened an extension to Concord Center via Bedford. A Victorian-style passenger station was built in 1874. In 1877, the Billerica and Bedford Railroad, a narrow-gauge line, opened from Bedford Depot to North Billerica. The line built a two-stall engine house and a turntable at the Bedford terminus. The Billerica and Bedford was markedly unsuccessful, and closed down in 1878. In 1879, the Middlesex Central was extended to Reformatory station in Concord; this permitted short-lived through service to Nashua via a connection to the Nashua, Acton, and Boston Railroad. In 1885, the Boston & Lowell rebuilt the route to Billerica as part of their standard gauge network. The depot, originally west of South Road, was moved to its present location at the junction. The narrow gauge engine house was also moved and turned into a freight depot. Two years later, the Boston and Maine Railroad absorbed the Boston & Lowell, including the two routes through Bedford. Decline After the Cambridge Subway opened in 1912, streetcar lines connecting at Harvard Square began to siphon off passenger traffic from the northwestern suburban lines. Within six years, about half of Lexington Branch trains (through trains from Reformatory and Lowell, plus short turns from Bedford, Lexington, and Arlington) had been cut from schedules. Passenger service ended on the Reformatory Branch in 1926, and on the Lexington Branch beyond Bedford in 1933, though freight service continued for several more decades. A wye with an engine house in the center was built just west of the station around this time to turn trains. By 1950 service was down to three daily round trips from Bedford; this decreased to two several years later and one on May 18, 1958. When the newly formed MBTA began subsidizing B&M; commuter service in 1965, the MBTA intended to drop the single Lexington Branch and Central Mass Branch round trips, but they were instead kept. RDC #6211 and the Minuteman Bike Path in 2010 On January 10, 1977, a major snowstorm blocked the line for several days. The MBTA decided then to discontinue service on the lightly used and poorly maintained line. After lawsuits, the MBTA agreed to help construct the Minuteman Bike Path from Alewife to Bedford in exchange for being released from requirements to restore service. The trail was to be constructed so as not to preclude future restoration, nor an extension of the MBTA Red Line along the corridor. However, local opposition in Arlington prevented such a subway extension (which might have terminated in Arlington, Lexington, or even Bedford at a Route 128 park-and-ride station). NRHP and RDC6211 The depot and freight house were sold by the B&M; to private businesses in the 1950s, and a second story was added to the depot in the 1960s. The town of Bedford purchased both in 1999, following a four-year effort by the Friends of Bedford Depot Park, and restored them as the centerpieces of the Bedford Depot Park. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 as part of the Bedford Depot Park Historic District. The freight house received a $350,000 renovation from 2006 to 2008 and serves as a museum run by the Friends; the depot continues to house private businesses. In 1998, Budd Rail Diesel Car #6211, an ex-B&M; car that had been used for Lexington Branch service decades earlier, was brought from Billerica Repair Shops to the former railroad yard west of South Road for rehabilitation. The $125,000 project, funded by the town and done under the watch of a former B&M; worker, restored the car to its original specifications but not to running condition. In 2003, the car was moved across South Road to its present location next to the freight house.

The west side of the rock is the site of the two earliest Congregational meeting houses in Malden (First Meeting House 1649-1658 and Second Meeting House 1660-1730). The park also has an American Civil War memorial statue \\"The Flag Defenders\\" by Bela Pratt and a World War II memorial. The park was laid out in 1910 by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. History The rocky outcrop that is the most prominent feature of Bell Rock Memorial Park has been an important local landmark since early colonial days. A bell was hung from scaffolding on top of the rock in 1658 to summon the faithful for worship; it is from this usage that the park derives its name. Although it was the site of Malden's first two meeting houses, the second was removed in 1727 (as was the bell), and the immediate area remained as pastureland until 1904. In 1907 the city awarded a commission to Bela Pratt to create a sculpture commemorating the city's American Civil War soldiers. To find a site for this monument, the city engaged Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., who had been consulting for the city on the development of other parks in its system. Olmsted recommended the Bell Rock site, which was acquired by the city in 1904. Olmsted worked on the park's design from 1908 to 1917. He carefully laid out its paths to take account of the site's topography, and to provide ready views of Pratt's sculpture, which he sited at the highest point of the park. The paths were also laid out to provide a seamless connection to the neighborhood, despite the topographical challenges posed by its sometimes significant changes in elevation. The bronze sculpture \\"The Flag Defenders\\" is composed of three figures, representing the three branches of the military at the time: Navy, Army, and Marines. One figure holds an American flag; the other two crouch and watch guard. It is mounted on a base designed by R. Clipson Sturges. In addition to this sculpture, the city has added a number of other memorials to the park. There are several plaques, commemorating the site's early history and the city's Revolutionary War soldiers, as well as larger memorials to the various conflicts the country has been involved in since the park's creation. There is also a stone and bronze tablet commemorating Michael Wigglesworth, one of Malden's leading 17th century ministers.

Built c. 1812, it is a well-preserved example of rural Federal period architecture, and is associated with a property that was farmed for two centuries. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Most of its associated farm property is now local conservation land. Description and history The Bennett-Shattuck House is located on the north side of Martins Pond Road, a winding lane passing through the rural northeastern part of the community. The house consists of a main block, 2-1/2 stories in height, with a side gable roof and central chimney, from which a two-story ell extends to the right. The main facade, oriented roughly southward, is five bays wide, with a center entrance that is framed by pilasters supporting an entablature with cornice. The exterior finish is wooden shingles, the roof is asphalt, and the foundation is split fieldstone. The ell, three bays wide, is set back from the front, and also has a side- gable roof. The interior retains a significant amount of original material, including its principal staircase, as well as trim, plaster walls, and wide pine floorboards in most of its rooms. Only the kitchen has been substantially modernized on the ground floor; the left front room retains a swinging hook (used in period cooking fireplaces) and a bake oven. The ell, apparently built to house a workshop, has a completely unfinished first floor interior, with exposed balloon framing. The house was built about 1812, after the previous house (probably set on the same foundation) was destroyed by fire. The oldest documented house on this property was standing in 1738. The current house was probably built by Joseph Sawtell, a local builder, for Joseph Bennett. Acquired by Eliza and Arthur Shattuck in 1879, it remained in their family until 1967. The Bennetts, Shattucks, and intervening owners all actively farmed the property, which originally included of land across the street, which is now town-owned conservation land. The last active farming use of the property was about 1989. The property was thereafter acquired by the Groton Land Foundation, which subdivided the land, and has resold the house with preservation restrictions.

The C.P. Talbot & Company mill building still stands in the center of the district. The buildings were planned and sited over decades, spanning from the mid-19th century until the 1920s. The Talbot brothers were able to secure land bordering the Concord Falls from the defunct Middlesex Canal Company (MCC) in 1851. The dam, water power and of MCC land were secured for $10,000. In 1857, CP Talbot secured additional property from neighbor Faulkner and an agreement with Faulkner over water power rights. Also in 1857 they partnered with the Lowell-based Belvidere Company for 5 years, supplying water power while Belvidere gave the equipment and know-how. The exact date of the large brick building and clock tower is not known, but likely between 1865 and 1870. It was at this time that the Talbot brothers built the first tenement company housing for workers as well. The company operated and existed for 100 years until 1956. The Talbot brothers were the children of Charles and Phoebe (White) Talbot (married in 1802) whose children were Charles P. (b. 1807) and Thomas (b. 1818) among six others.

The short was released on December 23, 1938. The film parodies several Mother Goose nursery rhymes using caricatures of popular Hollywood film stars of the 1930s. The film was directed by Wilfred Jackson and was the last to have a Silly Symphony title card, even though it was the third to last film of the series. Plot The film begins with a nursery book that opens by itself. Mother Goose appears on the title of the Leo the Lion from the MGM title cards. Underneath the goose is written, in Pig Latin, \\"Nertz to You\\". The opening disclaimer states that \\"any resemblance to characters herein portrayed to persons living or dead, is purely coincidental.\\" Little Bo Peep (Katharine Hepburn) claims she \\"lost her sheep, really I have\\". After performing a few ballet steps she looks behind the next page of the book, which is turned around. The next scene shows Old King Cole (Hugh Herbert) excited when his fiddlers arrive (The Marx Brothers). The trio starts playing their violins, but then break them over their knees. The king enjoys this very much, but his court jester (Ned Sparks) obviously does not. The king commands \\"off with their heads.\\" Then Joe Penner brings the king a bowl and, in reference to his famous catch phrase, asks \\"wanna buy a duck?\\" Donald Duck appears out of the water in the bowl, repeats Penner's catchphrase and starts laughing. The king then replaces the lid on the bowl, much to the chagrin of Donald. On the following page the nursery rhyme Rub-a-dub-dub is portrayed with Charles Laughton (as Captain Bligh from Mutiny on the Bounty), Spencer Tracy (as Manuel Fidello from Captains Courageous) and Freddie Bartholomew (who also appeared in Captains Courageous and is dressed as Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he also starred in). Just like a similar scene in Captains Courageous Bartholomew falls overboard, but Tracy pulls him back in. Then Katharine Hepburn passes by on an outboard motor still looking for her sheep. The tub overturns when the trio tries to hitch a ride with Hepburn. W. C. Fields plays Humpty Dumpty. He inspects a bird's nest with the words, \\"My Little Chickadee\\", but discovers Charlie McCarthy sitting in it. He insults Fields who tries to attack him, but then falls off the wall onto a mushroom which then resembles an egg cup. Simple Simon (Stan Laurel) is seen fishing with a fish on his hook and catching worms instead of the other way around. The Pieman (Oliver Hardy) is busy tending a large stack of his pies on a wagon. Laurel refuses an offered pie, but picks one from the middle of the stack, which alarms Hardy, fearing the stack will collapse. Nothing happens, however and a reassured Hardy tries to do the same. When the stack collapses and one of the pies lands on his head, he looks angrily at Laurel. Laurel swallows his pie in one piece and then snickers at Hardy. Hardy throws one of his pies at Laurel, who ducks his head inside his shirt, and the pie lands in the face of Katharine Hepburn. The pie transforms her face into a blackface and she starts speaking in African-American slang. See Saw Margery Daw is performed by Edward G. Robinson and Greta Garbo on a seesaw. Garbo says: \\"I want so much to be alone\\", to which Robinson replies: \\"O.K., babe, you asked for it!\\". He leaves and Garbo falls off the seesaw. Little Jack Horner (Eddie Cantor) opens the next scene, a big musical sequence. He sings Sing a Song of Sixpence and when he mentions the line, \\"four and twenty black birds baked in a pie\\" several African-American jazz and swing musicians stick their heads out of a large pie. One of them is Cab Calloway (singing \\"Hi-de- Ho!\\") who invites Little Boy Blue (Wallace Beery) to blow his horn. When this takes some time, Fats Waller asks \\"Where's that boy?\\" to which Stepin Fetchit replies \\"What boy?\\" Beery finally wakes up and blows his horn until he's out of breath. The book pops open to reveal a big shoe (a reference to There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe) and all the characters start singing, dancing and playing instruments. The camera zooms in on three trumpet playing ladies (Edna May Oliver, Mae West and ZaSu Pitts), a flute player (Clark Gable) and a saxophonist (George Arliss). Oliver Hardy plays trombone and Stan Laurel plays clarinet, whose repeated notes annoy Hardy so much he hits Laurel over the head with a hammer. Laurel's clarinet then sounds like a bass clarinet. Fats Waller plays piano until Groucho and Chico start playing with him. He sends them away, but discovers that his piano now plays by itself. When he looks inside, Harpo is seen plucking the strings. He exclaims: \\"The man's crazy!\\". Fred Astaire tap dances and invites Stepin Fetchit to dance along with him. Fetchit tries to encourage his feet by saying \\"Git Along, Little Dogies\\", but he is too lazy, and his feet release steam from the effort. Cab Calloway is much more excited and energetic and sings and dances along with his band. W.C. Fields plays double bass with Charlie McCarthy sitting on the instrument. Charles Laughton declares the music to be \\"It's mutiny, but I love it!\\". Martha Raye and Joe E. Brown are seen dancing and laughing so loud that their mouths are opened wide. When Raye kisses Joe E. Brown (leaving a large lipstick smear) his mouth opens so wide that the camera tracks inside. There, Katharine Hepburn is still looking for her sheep.

Pope Shenouda III assigned Father Samuel Thabet Samuel to head that church in September 1983, and Father Samuel and his wife and two children left Egypt and moved to Roxborough. The congregation later bought the current building in Norristown, Pennsylvania. The parish was built in 1863 using Greek revival architecture. It was originally a Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church.Montgomery County: St. George Coptic Orthodox Church (Retrieved 08-07-2008) In order for the building to allow for Coptic Orthodox Liturgies, the interior required a partial conversion for that use. The exterior, however, retained its architectural style. The building was consecrated in October 1994, by Pope Shenouda III. The parish had more than one priest in its history. Fr. Angelos Habib Boghdadi served the parish in its early years, as well as several other Coptic Churches throughout the States, including St. Mary Coptic Orthodox Church in Ambridge, Pennsylvania. Fr.

His is the most recent execution to be performed by the Bahamas. Mitchell was convicted of stabbing his victims to death and received the mandatory sentence of death by hanging. He was originally scheduled to be executed on 10 August 1999, but execution was delayed to allow the Bahamian appeal courts to hear his appeal on the constitutionality of the death penalty. His appeal was rejected by the Bahamian courts and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which acts as the final court of appeal for the Bahamas. Mitchell was hanged in the Fox Hill Prison in Nassau on the morning of 6 January 2000. His execution was controversial because it was carried out while he had an appeal pending before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Amnesty International alleged that this amounted to a violation of the Bahamas' treaty obligations as a member of the Organization of American States. The victims' son had also requested that the death sentence be commuted. John Higgs was scheduled to be executed the same day as Mitchell for an unrelated murder, but he committed suicide the day before.

The three parkways, The Fellsway, Fellsway West, and Fellsway East serve to provide access from the lower portion of the Mystic River Reservation to the Middlesex Fells Reservation. The latter two parkways continue northward, providing access to the interior of the Fells and providing a further connection to Lynn Fells Parkway. Significant portions of these parkways south of the Fells, which were among the first connecting parkways designed to be part of the Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston by Charles Eliot, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Background Following the enactment of authorizing legislation in 1894, the Metropolitan Parks Commission (predecessor to the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) and today's Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR)) began working with Charles Eliot to plan a parkway to provide access from Boston to the Middlesex Fells Reservation. This job was made difficult due to the existence of relatively densely populated areas between the Mystic River and the reservation. The plan that the commission and Eliot finally drafted called for an arterial trunk (The Fellsway), which would run north through Medford and Malden, and then split into two branches. Fellsway West would provide access to the promontory point at Pine Hill in Medford (now visible on the west side of Interstate 93) and the western parts of the reservation, while Fellsway East would provide access to Bear's Den Hill in Malden, and points east. These corridors were wide () rights of way, in order to provide for several modes of transportation: automobile, street car, and pedestrians and cyclists. The Fellsway Land for The Fellsway was acquired in 1896. Its original southern terminus was at Mystic Avenue in Somerville, and was further extended south to Broadway in 1898. The Somerville section of the parkway south of Mystic Avenue later became part of the McGrath Highway, and the intervening section was extensively altered by the construction of I-93. The Fellsway is designated Massachusetts Route 28 for its entire length. From Somerville it crosses the Mystic River into Medford on the Wellington Bridge and soon enters the Wellington Circle interchange, where it joins with Mystic Valley Parkway and Revere Beach Parkway, both designated Massachusetts Route 16. It crosses into Malden near Devir Park, shortly before it ends at the junction with Fellsway West and Fellsway East. The Medford and Malden portions of The Fellsway, including its medians and Wellington Circle, are part of the National Register listing for the Fells Connector Parkways. ;Major intersections Fellsway West Portions of the Fellsway West right of way were acquired in 1896; the rest were obtained in 1897. The eastern portion followed an existing alignment along Medford's Valley Street. The road runs west from the northern end of The Fellsway, soon after crossing Massachusetts Route 60 just across the Malden-Medford line in Medford. At Fulton Street the road turns north, paralleling Interstate 93 to Roosevelt Circle, which is where it terminated when completed in 1898. From Roosevelt Circle it continues northward into the Fells, in an extension constructed between 1905 and 1908, and was fully extended to Stoneham in 1931. The section from a point about north of Roosevelt Circle has been extensively altered due to the construction of I-93. Only the section between Fulton Street and The Fellsway is part of the National Register listing for the Fells Connector Parkways; the section immediately north of Roosevelt Circle is included in the Middlesex Fells Reservation Parkways listing. Fellsway West is designated Massachusetts Route 28 for its entire length. ;Major intersections Fellsway East Fellsway East runs north from the interchange with The Fellsway and Fellsway West, with its entire length in Malden, Melrose, and Stoneham. The oldest portion runs to East Border Road at the southern edge of the Fells, crossing Massachusetts Route 60 and passing Fellsmere Park. Except for a brief section, it is a broad multilane boulevard with an impressive tree canopy over the northern part, and is the best preserved section of the Fells Connector Parkways. From the junction with East Border Road, it becomes a narrow park road, passing into a heavily wooded section of the Fells Reservation in Melrose. It then becomes a border road, skirting the eastern edge of the reservation in Melrose before reaching its end at a junction with Pond Street and Lynn Fells Parkway in Stoneham. The section of this parkway south of East Border Road is listed as part of the Fellsway Connector Parkways; the northern section is listed as part of the Middlesex Fells Reservation Parkways. ;Major intersections Alterations Several significant alterations have been made to these roadways since they were first laid out. Streetcar lines ran all the way along The Fellsway and Fellsway West from 1907 into the 1940s, and eventually reached all the way to Stoneham Square. This service was cut back to run only along the Fellsway, and completely discontinued in the 1950s. The Wellington Bridge, originally a drawbridge, was replaced in 1914. Roosevelt Circle was built (as a surface rotary) in the 1930s to address increasing traffic volume, and was replaced by the present aerial rotary with the construction of I-93 in the late 1950s. Wellington Circle, originally a rotary, was extensively redesigned in 1941 and again in 1956. The southernmost section of the Fellsway was effectively obliterated by the construction of I-93 through Somerville.

The surviving alignment in Weston, Massachusetts extends along the entire length of United States Route 20, except for a bypassed section that passes through the town's village center. The of roadway retains much of the generally rural appearance it had during the late colonial period, and the town center retains significant elements of historic character as well. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Boston Post Road was one of the first major roadways to be developed in colonial New England. The section of US 20 in Weston was originally a Native American footpath, and had its first documented use as a post road in 1673. What is now Weston was originally the westernmost precinct of Watertown, and its town center arose around its first meeting house built in 1695. The road was upgraded in 1783 to accommodate stagecoaches. Some of the route's oldest buildings are taverns operated in part to support passing travelers, including the Golden Ball Tavern (1763) and Josiah Smith's (1757). The roadway is in part significant for its importance in the American Revolutionary War, when it was used by Patriot forces to move men and military supplies. Sites of importance along the road include Lamson Park, where Weston's militia mustered before marching to the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, and the Golden Ball Tavern, whose Loyalist owner made it the target of protests. The route gradually declined in importance in the 19th century, as it was supplanted by more directly routed turnpikes. As a result, the roadway has retained much rural character, with only limited encroachment from suburban residential development and the growth of the center to accommodate a larger population. The historic district extends for the entire length of US 20, some 3-1/2 miles. It also includes a segment of post road that passes through the town center, which was bypassed in 1931. The district is more than , and includes properties that are generally widely spaced in the eastern and western reaches, with a cluster of development around the village.

It claims to host more than 1 million images. History Getty Designs was developed by CosmoSun, a MSC Malaysia Status company that launched Getty Designs in December 2004. The service emerged from tools originally created for Cosmo's, a web-based software developer. Early versions of Getty Designs focused on an images library with photo exchange capabilities. There was also an emphasis on collecting images found on the web rather than photographs taken by users. The successive evolutions focused more on the uploading and filing backend for individual users and the exchange function was buried in the site map. In February 2008, Property2u acquired Getty Designs. During the week of, all content was migrated to Property2u server in Malaysia, resulting in all data being subject to Law of the Malaysia.

Developed between about 1860 and 1904, it includes surviving mill buildings and a variety of mill- related worker housing. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history Brookside Village is centered on Brookside Road, running from Lowell Street to Coolidge Avenue, and includes adjacent properties on Coolidge Avenue and Moore Road. The main structure in the district is the old Brookside Woolen Company mill building, a two-story masonry structure built in 1862 and enlarged in 1894. The mill took its power from Stony Brook, which runs across the southern part of the district. The other principal non-residential structures are the dam across the brook, and a social club at 11 Brookside Road, an English Revival structure built in 1920 as a dining hall for the mill's employees. The rest of the district represents worker housing, most of which was built in the later decades of the 19th century, and are largely in vernacular styles of the period. The current mill building stands on the site of the first documented fulling mill in Westford, which was built about 1725. Mills were also recorded on the site on an 1831 map, as was a bridge across the brook. In the late 1850s Theodore Hamblett, owner of a sawmill and gristmill at Depot Street, began purchasing properties in the area, including the existing mills. In 1862 he sold the mills to George and Seth Moore, who transformed the property into a woolen mill operation, erecting the oldest surviving portion of the mill that year. The mill owners did not at first build very much worker housing, as sufficient housing was typically built by others in the area. It was not until about 1895 that the company began building housing in significant numbers. The mills declined during the Great Depression, and were closed by 1945. Mill ownership divested itself of the area housing stock by the mid-1950s.

Bernhardt spent parts of four seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Yankees (1976), and the Seattle Mariners (1977‚Äì79). As a member of the inaugural Mariners team in 1977, he hit the team's first home run. Over his major league career, he compiled a .238 batting average with 46 runs scored, 117 hits, 19 doubles, two triples, nine home runs, and 43 runs batted in (RBIs) in 154 games played. The majority of Bernhardt's career was spent in the minor leagues. He began his professional career in 1971 with the Class-A Key West Sun Caps. In the minors, he would go on to play for the Class-A Fort Lauderdale Yankees (1972‚Äì73), the Double-A West Haven Yankees (1974‚Äì75), the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs (1975‚Äì76), the Triple-A San Jose Missions (1978), the Triple-A Spokane Indians (1979), the Triple-A Iowa Oaks (1979), the Triple-A Tabasco Plataneros, the Triple-A Campeche Piratas/Alacranes (1981‚Äì83), and the Triple-A Aguascalientes Rieleros. He served as a player-manager from 1981 to 1982. Professional career=New York Yankees On August 1, 1970, Bernhardt signed with the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent. Bernhardt made his professional baseball debut in 1971 in the Yankees minor league organization. With the Class-A Key West Sun Caps that year, he batted .249 with 25 runs scored, 82 hits, 15 doubles, two triples, one home run, and 31 runs batted in (RBIs) in 97 games played. Defensively, Bernhardt played 54 games at third base, 28 games at first base, five games in the outfield, and three games at shortstop.

Bernhardt continued playing with the Class-A Fort Lauderdale Yankees in 1973. In only 37 games played that year, he batted .337 with 34 hits, four doubles, and one home run. After the season, the New York Yankees purchased his contract, adding him to their 40-man roster. Bernhardt attended spring training with New York in 1974, but was assigned to the Double-A West Haven Yankees before the start of the regular season. With West Have that year, Bernhardt batted .201 with 20 runs scored, 37 hits, six doubles, one triple, three home runs, and 19 RBIs in 60 games played. Bernhardt split the 1975 season between the Double-A West Haven Yankees, and the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs. At the Double-A level, he batted .319 with 51 hits, 10 doubles, one triple, and one home run in 41 games played. In the field, he played third base, and first base.

After his promotion to the Chiefs, Bernhardt batted .303 with 22 runs scored, 90 hits, 19 doubles, one triple, four home runs, and 44 RBIs in 79 games played. Defensively, he played 33 games at third base, 33 games in the outfield, and 16 games at first base. Combined between the two clubs, Bernhardt's batting average was .309. In 1976, Bernhardt began the season with the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs. However, in July, the New York Yankees purchased his contract from the minor leagues when Elliott Maddox was placed on the disabled list. Bernhardt made his debut in Major League Baseball on July 10, against the Chicago White Sox, where in one at-bat, he went hitless. His first hit came on July 17, in a game against the Texas Rangers. In August, he was sent back to the minor leagues. In September, the Yankees attempted to trade Bernhardt in exchange for Rico Carty, but nothing ever came of it. In the majors, Bernhardt batted .190 with four hits in 21 at-bats. In the minor leagues, he batted .303 with 41 runs scored, 115 hits, 24 doubles, eight home runs, and 57 RBIs in 101 games played. Seattle Mariners During the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft, Bernhardt was selected by the Seattle Mariners from the New York Yankees. Bernhardt made the inaugural Mariners team out of spring training in 1977. During his first game of the season, Bernhardt got five hits, including a home run, in five at- bats. Not only was it Bernhardt's first career home run, but it was also the first home run in Mariners history. On the season, Bernhardt batted .243 with 32 runs scored, 74 hits, nine doubles, two triples, seven home runs, and 30 RBIs in 89 games played. Defensively, he played 21 games at third base, and eight games at first base. The majority of his playing time, 54 games, was spent as a designated hitter in the Mariners lineup.

The district covers , and includes six houses and three barns whose construction dates range from the late 17th to the late 19th centuries. Many of them have some association with the descendants of Roger Buck, who with his son Ephraim is said to have built the Ephraim Buck House (216 Wildwood Street) around the turn of the 18th century. Other houses in the district range along Woburn Street, south from Wildwood Street to Allenhurst Way. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The oldest portion of the Ephraim Buck House is believed to have been built c. 1704, with a second section added in the 1740s. Its exterior was restyled c. 1770 to give it Federal period styling, including a front door entry with 3/4 length sidelight windows and an entablature. The Daniel Eames House at 584 Woburn Street may also have been built by Ephraim Buck, c. 1714-23, and is a fairly typical early Georgian house. A third 18th century house, that at 604 Woburn Street, was originally believed to be 17th century in origin, but is more likely a Federal period construction from c. 1785-91. The Jonathan Buck House (571 Woburn Street, c. 1795-1820) is an excellent local example of Federal architecture, and one of only a few period hip roofed houses in the town. It is the typical five bays wide and two deep, with a central doorway flanked by full-length sidelight windows and pilasters supporting a narrow entablature. The remaining contributing houses to the district were built later in the 19th century: the Henry Sheldon House (603 Woburn Street, c. 1861-62) is Italianate in style, and the John Howard Eames House (590 Woburn Street, c. 1883) is a Queen Anne Victorian. Three houses have 19th century barns that contribute to the district (as did the Ephraim Buck House until its barn was demolished). Two houses within the district bounds do not contribute to its significance. One is a modern house (c. 1999) at 588 Woburn Street; the other, at 580 Woburn Street, was an Italianate house built c. 1856-75, but has been renovated in an historically insensitive manner. A Buck family house at 585 Woburn Street, dating to the late 18th century, was demolished not long before the district boundaries were drawn.

The district is centered on the four-way intersection of School, Wellesley, Newton and Ash Streets in Weston, Massachusetts, and runs mainly along Wellesley Street, which runs north-south through the district between the centers of Weston and Wellesley. The district encompasses a pastoral landscape managed by Marian Case, a horticulturalist and landscape preservationist. One of its central features is the Case Estates, a property bequested by Case to Harvard University that once served as a nursery for Boston's Arnold Arboretum. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The multi-junction intersection of Wellesley, School, Newton, and Ash Streets is located near the geographic center of Weston, a sprawling suburb of Boston, Massachusetts. To the west and north of this junction is a cluster of civic buildings, including several schools and former school buildings, as well as the Weston Public Library. East of this cluster and north of the junction is a residential area of late 19th and early 20th century houses that is bounded on the north by United States Route 20, which forms the historic district's northern boundary. East of the junction is town-owned open land that is partially occupied by Land's Sake Farm, but is generally preserved by the town as open space. To the south and southwest are lands that made up a significant portion of the former Case Estate, some which are now owned by Harvard University. Included in these lands are the Case Estates, west of Wellesley Street, which served as a nursery for the Harvard- owned Arnold Arboretum in Boston, but are now under negotiations to be acquired by the town. The core of the historic district is a landscape mostly developed and preserved by Marian Case. Her father, James Case, was a wealthy Boston businessman who purchased land here in 1869, and in 1889 built the large Shingle style mansion at 89 Wellesley Street. After James Case died in 1907, Marian established what became known has Hillcrest Gardens, a model market garden property which she used to educate and train a generation of horticulturalists, and to bring an appreciation of the vanishing rural landscapes to the town's children. In addition to the garden property, she purchased adjacent farm properties, preserving their farmhouses and outbuildings. The Hillcrest garden property was bequested to Harvard upon her death in 1944.

Land acquisition for the parks lining the Charles began in 1895, with park and parkway construction beginning soon afterward. The western portion of Soldiers Field Road was one of the first to be built, as part of the Charles River Speedway, an early racing oval, between 1899 and 1910. Other roads completed by 1910 include the listed portions of North Beacon Street, Greenough Boulevard, and Charles River Road. Nonantum Road was built between 1910 and 1931. Leo Birmingham Boulevard was completed in 1936, as a bypass around a slaughterhouse on the river that the MDC had been unable to acquire. It was eventually taken in the 1940s, allowing for the completion of Soldiers Field Road. The master plan for the upper river was predicated on acquiring sufficient land for the building of continuous roadways, which was precluded by dense land use in portions of Watertown and Waltham. The oldest of the roads is Quinobequin Road, built in 1900. Recreation Road and Norumbega Road were both built in the 1930s. Recreation Road has since been impacted by the construction of both Interstate 95 and the Massachusetts Turnpike, which have cut off elements of the waterfront from land access.

During the American Civil War, a new commander's quarters was commissioned by then-Capt. Thomas J. Rodman, inventor of the Rodman gun, for the Watertown Arsenal. The lavish, , quarters would ultimately become one of the largest commander's quarters on any U.S. military installation. The expense ($63,478.65) was considered wasteful and excessive and drew a stern rebuke from Congress, who then promoted Rodman to Brigadier General and sent him to command Rock Island Arsenal on the frontier in Illinois, where he built an even larger commander's quarters. The Watertown commander's quarters house now houses offices and a museum about the arsenal.

The houses were built in 1870 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  History  The Clark Houses are significant as two of the finer examples of the Second Empire/mansard style in Natick, MA. They are also significant for their association with Edward Clark, a local entrepreneur. Edward Clark was born in Natick in August 1838. He was the son of Nathaniel Clark, builder of the Clark Block in Natick Center, which is also listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Edward was established as a prominent Natick grocer by 1882. His business was housed in the Clark Block. He succeeded his father as town treasurer from 1889-1910, and while in office handled more than four million dollars. Edward was a director of the Natick National Bank, of which his father was a founder. During Edward's lifetime he also served as a trustee of the Morse Hospital and treasurer of the Park Cemetery Association. He died in 1910. The house at 74 West Central was built by Clark in 1870. 76 West Central Street -- known as the \\"Mary Clark Whitney House\\" -- stands directly west of the Edward Clark House (#74). It is the second of five houses on West Central Street known as \\"the Clark Houses.\\" The house was built by Edward Clark (owner of #74 and cousin of Mary Clark Whitney) for Mary and her husband James Whitney. The couple was socially prominent in the town of Natick. James Whitney, a native of Sherborn, MA, went into partnership in a Natick-based clothing business in 1857 with Alfred W. Mann, originally of Templeton, MA. The firm, Mann and Whitney went out of business following the Panics of 1857 and 1861. Mr. Whitney then joined the Natick Protective Clothing Company, and subsequently served as treasurer of the Natick Five Cents Savings Bank, a position he held until his death in July, 1889. Mary Clark Whitney, was born January 8, 1816, one of 13 children, to Alphonse and Nancy Leland Clark of Sherborn, MA. Both of Mrs. Whitney's grandfathers served in the Revolutionary War. The Natick Chapter of the DAR made her an honorary member, and planned \\"an observance\\" on the century mark of her birth on January 8, 1916. However, fate intervened, and on the morning of December 24, 1915, two weeks before her 100th birthday, Mrs. Whitney died quietly in her home of 45 years. Her obituary in the Natick Bulletin, December 24, 1915, noted that \\"General sorrow was manifested on Wednesday by the people of Natick when it became known that its oldest woman, Mrs. James Whitney,...had passed away in the night.\\" Mary Clark Whitney was survived by her daughter, Mrs. Annie Bean, as well as Mrs. Bean's husband and two daughters, Madeline and Clara Bean.  Architecture  Both buildings, at 74 and 76 West Central Street respectively, represent coherent examples of the Second Empire style. The house at 76 West Central Street is a three-story, T-plan Second Empire structure set on a granite foundation. The main rectangle is three bays wide by two bays deep. The hip roofed ell attached to the rear elevation is two bays wide by two bays deep. The house is sheathed in beaded clapboards painted beige. Cornerboards and water-table are plain. The wide entablature is ornamented by irregularly placed paired brackets beneath the widely overhanging eaves. The high mansard roof is covered by fish scale slate tiles. Fenestration is 2/2 framed by plum-colored louvered shutters on the first two stories. First story windows are headed by a molded projecting cornice. Second story windows are headed by a triangular pediment with a boss at their center. The gable dormers contain 2/2 windows flanked by a stepped architrave and headed by an open triangular pediment. The facade faces north toward West Central Street. A central projecting pavilion rises the full three stories, with the first story being an entrance portico. Paired Doric columns support the portico entablature with its bracketed corners. Narrow Doric pilasters frame double Italianate style \\"tombstone\\" entrance doors. The second story of the pavilion has a wide molded sill beneath double-arched 1/1 windows with a projecting flat cornice on the facade and a segmentally arched 1/1 window on both the east and the west sides of the projection. The gable dormer above has a segmentally arched window The east elevation has a three-sided flat-roofed projection on the first story. The three sides are at 45-degree angles to one another. Each corner has two pairs of brackets beneath the cornice. Two windows stand above on the second story, with a dormer overhead. The east elevation of the ell has an open porch with a single window overhead on the second story. The west elevation of the house has two windows on both stories. The west elevation of the ell has a second story window at the northern end and a first story window at the southern end.

It is styled with a mix of late Georgian and Federal style woodwork. The property's barn was also built by Henry Fletcher using the same construction methods. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Fletcher House is set on the north side of Concord Road (Massachusetts Route 225), just west of its junction with Preservation Way, in a rural-residential area of southern Westford. It is a 2-1/2 story timber frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. The main facade faces south, and is symmetrically arranged, with a center entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by a four-light transom window and simple entablature and cornice. The interior layout follows a typical Georgian center-chimney plan, with public rooms on either side of the chimney, and a kitchen area behind. Ells and minor additions, most of them 20th-century enlarge the house. The barn, which stands east of the house, is of similar construction as the house, but was enlarged in the 20th century with a balloon-framed addition. The house and barn were built c. 1810-13 by Henry Fletcher, descended from one of the Westford area's first settlers. It is a distinctive retrograde example of Georgian architecture, at a time when it had been out of fashion for some time.

CUF is a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio. Its name is derived from the communities of Clifton Heights, University Heights, and Fairview. CUF is bordered by the neighborhoods of Clifton, the Heights, Mount Auburn, Over-the-Rhine, and Camp Washington. University Heights occupies the northern area of CUF, and is separated from Fairview and Clifton Heights by Straight Street. Fairview occupies the south-west corner and Clifton Heights the south-east corner of CUF. Fairview and Clifton Heights are separated by Ravine Street; Fairview on the west, Clifton Heights on the east. The population was 16,989 at the 2010 census. The term \\"CUF\\" is rarely, if ever, used by locals. Although inaccurate, these neighborhoods, along with Corryville, are often referred to as being part of Clifton, even by long-term residents. Clifton Heights The residential area of Clifton Heights is largely rental property that functions as off-campus student housing, with many restaurants and convenience stores. The Clifton Heights Business District of the fifties is completely gone and developed into businesses that cater to university students as there are few families remaining. Currently, the area has been redeveloped into a contemporary mixed-use district featuring restaurants, bars, boutiques and an urban-style Target. It is located in the area of McMillan Street and Calhoun Street between Vine/Jefferson and Clifton Avenue, immediately south of the University of Cincinnati campus. The architecturally significant St. George Church has been remodelled and is home to the Crossroads Church. The former St. George School is now home to Corryville Catholic School. Clifton Heights is home to the Hughes Center, a vocational and special-purpose high school. Its current Clifton Heights location was built in 1906. Currently there are five college prep schools housed at Hughes. The Paideia High School, the High School for Communications Professions and Health Professions, High School for Teaching and Technology and the Cincinnati Academy of Mathematics and Science (CAMAS). Clifton Heights is also home to the Kreuck recreation complex, a large indoor recreation center which is located on the campus of the Hughes Center. The Kreuck complex is a public facility operated by the Cincinnati Recreation Commission. Bellevue Hill, a city park located at Ohio Avenue, is well known for its overlook of downtown Cincinnati. The Clifton Heights Community Urban Redevelopment Corporation (CHCURC) is committed to the revitalization of the Clifton Heights neighborhood. It was established as a partnership between the Clifton Heights Business Association, the Clifton Heights, University Heights, and Fairview Neighborhood Association, and the University of Cincinnati. CHCURC was responsible for the University Park Apartments development. Clifton Heights is sometimes called \\"Clifton,\\" either intentionally shortened or not, by locals and non-locals. However, the actual Cincinnati neighborhood of Clifton is just north of CUF. University Heights University Heights is primarily a residential area, and like Clifton Heights and Fairview, there is an unusually high percentage of student-targeted rental property. However, unlike the other two neighborhoods, there is also a large contingent of owner- occupied single-family houses. University Heights is home to Good Samaritan Hospital as well as The Riddle Road Market. Fairview Fairview is a residential area, with a very high percentage of rental property targeted at University of Cincinnati students. Many of these buildings are excellent examples of the Italianate form of architecture prominent in many of Cincinnati's older neighborhoods. Fairview is known best as the former home of Fairvew German Language School, which was founded by the neighborhood's German community in 1888. In 2008 however the school was relocated to nearby Clifton. The neighborhood's name comes from the view much of the area has of downtown Cincinnati, as Fairview is perched on one of many hillsides facing the city proper. Fairview Park, a park located at McMillan Street, has a long driving path with numerous overlooks.

This complex is located at the end of Framingham Reservoir No. 1, which is also known as the Stearns Reservoir, off Winter Street and north of Long Avenue. Constructed from 1876-78 as part of an expansion of the water supply of the city of Boston, this was designed by its first city architect George A. Clough. The historical purpose of the reservoir, which was located at the confluence of two branches of the Sudbury River, was primarily to control the river's water level, and secondarily to provide reserve supply capacity. The reservoir's reserve capacity was generally used only as a backup supply, as the reservoir's muddy bottom made it a less desirable source than reservoir No. 3 upstream. However the reservoir No. 1 system was nonetheless important due to its role in controlling the flow of the river downstream, and due to the gatehouse which controlled the water flows for all the Framingham reservoirs into the Sudbury Aqueduct. Reservoir No. 1 is no longer maintained as a reserve water source, although it is still owned by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, successor to the Boston Water Board which oversaw its construction. MWRA retains ownership as the gatehouse contains the connection between Reservoir No. 3 and the Sudbury Aqueudct which remain part of the emergency water systems. The dam measures in length, with an overfall area that is long. The embankments are wide, with a core of granite rubble laid in cement. The overfall area is topped with cut granite, and originally had wooden flashboards held in by pins. The gatehouse is a 1-1/2 story granite structure, designed by Boston city architect George Clough. Located at the southern end of the overfall, it houses one end of the Sudbury Aqueduct extension pipe from Farm Pond, a pipe connecting this reservoir to numbers 2 and 3, and gates for channeling water either into the aqueduct or into the river. The gates allowed water to be selectively channeled from any of the reservoirs (1, 2, or 3) into the Sudbury Aqueduct or into the river below the dam. There are also flood gates and equipment for moving the dam's flashboards. Today the gatehouse, Sudbury Aqueduct, and the pipes from reservoir number 3 remain part of MWRA's emergency systems. If activated, the water from reservoir number 3 flows from the dam number 1 gatehouse down the Sudbury Aqueduct extension pipe to a gatehouse at Farm Pond where it enters the Sudbury Aqueduct proper which in turn brings the water to the Chestnut Hill Reservoir. The dam and gatehouse were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

The dam and gatehouse are located west of the junction of Winter and Fountain Streets, and impound a branch of the Sudbury River. The reservoir, which is also known as the Brackett Reservoir, was built 1877-79 as part of an expansion of the water supply of the city of Boston. The dam is in length, with a centered overfall area. The core of the dam is granite rubble laid in cement, with earthen embankments. The overfall area is faced on the downstream side with cut granite, and earthen embankment on the upstream side. It is topped with granite and originally had iron mounts for flashboards. The gatehouse is a rectangular granite structure with a steep hip roof, a brick chimney and an eyebrow dormer. The door and windows are in round-arch openings. It contains gate controls for regulating water flow from the reservoir and from a pipe connected to Reservoir No. 1, and a pipe connected to the Ashland Reservoir. The dam was built by contractors from upstate New York, and the gatehouse was built by James Fagin of Boston to a design by the Boston city architect, George Clough. The Metropolitan Water Board, established in 1895 to oversee the city's water supply, took the reservoir out of service soon afterward due to its poor water quality.

The dam and gatehouse are located at the southeastern end of Framingham Reservoir No. 3, off Massachusetts Route 9. They were built 1876‚Äì78 as part of an expansion of the public water supply of the city of Boston. The dam is long, and impounds an area of in the Sudbury River watershed. The reservoir is the largest of the three Framingham reservoirs that were built at that time. The dam's core is constructed of granite rubble laid in cement. There is a granite-lined overfall area long, which was originally topped by flashboards. At the end of the overfall area nearest Route 9 stands the gatehouse, a granite structure with a rectangular main block and a smaller wing. Both sections have a steeply pitched slate roof. The door is in a round-arch recess, and the building is capped by a cupola. It houses controls for two mains connected to the Sudbury Aqueduct via the gatehouse at Reservoir No. 1. The water is directed either directly beyond the dam into reservoir 1 or through the 4-foot mains to the Sudbury Aqueduct gatehouse. The dam was built by contractors from Worcester, and the gatehouse was built by Benjamin Dewing of Boston to a design by the Boston city architect, George Clough. Since its construction, the reservoir, which is also known as the Foss Reservoir, has been connected by an open channel to the Sudbury Reservoir (in 1898), and had its shore areas resurfaced (in 1907‚Äì08). Nearly all of the reservoir's water comes from the Sudbury Reservoir as its own natural watershed is very limited. Of the Framingham Reservoirs, Reservoir #3 is the only one that was regularly used throughout its time as an active water source due to its better water quality than the reservoirs to the south. The reservoir is no longer in active service though it is maintained as an emergency source. It is the only one of the Framingham reservoirs still maintained as an emergency source.

The district encapsulates historical development trends in Weston, in which land began in agricultural uses, and was later transformed into either resort or suburban residential housing. It is also notable for its longtime association with the Jennings family, who owned the land from the 18th century into the 20th, and engaged in all three land uses. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history The Glen Road Historic District is a linear area of about , extending along Glen Road in southern Weston, between Oak Street and Pembroke Road. The road is a winding country lane, now lined with suburban residential construction. All of its 28 houses are wood frame structures, either 1-1/2 or 2-1/2 stories in height, and most are finished in either wooden shingles or clapboards. The oldest house in the district is a c. 1732 farmhouse, which is also believed to be the town's oldest surviving building. Most of the other residences were built either as a series of cottages that were part of a hotel complex developed around the turn of the 20th century, or were suburban development from the early decades of the 20th century. The land through which Glen Road now winds was part of a land grant made in 1642 to William Jennings, when the area was an outer precinct of Watertown. Jennings descendant Nathaniel built the oldest house here, now standing at 266 Glen Road. The second house in the district was built about 1812 by Paul Pratt, now at 317 Glen Road. In the late 19th century, most of the land in the area was consolidated again under Edward Jennings, who operated a dairy farm called Glen Farm. Edward's brother Willard, also a farmer, took in boarders during the summer, beginning a small tourist trade. The house now at 245 Glen Road was expanded as a small hotel with forty rooms, and Willard Jennings added five cottages to establish a small resort complex; four of these still survive. Sometime in the 1920s, the wings of the hotel were destroyed by fire. With the dairy operation in declined in the 1910s, the Jenningses began to subdivide the property, resulting in the construction of most of the other residences in the area.

Built in 1768, it is one of the town's finest examples of Late Georgian architecture. It also played a pivotal role in local activities during the American Revolution, due to its Loyalist tavern keeper. The tavern was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was included in Weston's Boston Post Road Historic District in 1983. Description The Golden Ball Tavern stands on the south side of Boston Post Road, near the center of Weston, just east of its junction with Golden Ball Lane. It is a two-story wood frame structure, its main section covered by a hip roof and finished in wooden clapboards. A two-story ell, likely an older house, extends to one side, and a single-story ell to the other. The main entrance is at the center of a five-bay facade, flanked by simple pilasters and topped by a modillioned cornice. The property also has a barn that is believed to date to the main house's construction. History The tavern was built in 1768 by Captain Isaac Jones, a local shopkeeper. Jones, a Loyalist, gave shelter to British soldiers performing reconnaissance on rebellious activities in 1774. After the Boston Tea Party in December 1773, the tavern was raided by local Patriots, who believed Jones to be serving tea on which hated taxes had been collected. Known locally as the Weston Tea Party, the event consisted of little more than a ransacking of the premises (which had no taxed tea). Later in the Revolution, Jones apparently joined the cause of independence, and regained a position of prominence in the community. His tavern flourished until the early 19th century, when the opening of the Worcester Turnpike siphoned traffic away from the Post Road. The tavern closed about 1805, and was then occupied as a residence by six generations of the Jones family. It then underwent restoration, and has since been opened as a museum.

The competition resumed in 1945 as hostilities were drawing to a close. The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds. Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included Ponsonby, Waterside (Wellington), Hamilton Wanderers, Nomads (Christchurch), and Mosgiel. The 1940 final Waterside successfully defended the trophy for a second consecutive time, becoming the first team to win the trophy three times. The final also saw the first re-match since 1925, with the two teams having previously met in the 1938 final. Eight Waterside players (Sid Ward, Bob Bolton, Fred Hazel, Colin McCarthy, Tom Walker, Sonny Ward, Alf Longbottom, and Toby Janes) played in all three finals, and eight Mosgiel players played in both the 1938 and 1940 finals. Bolton, Janes, and Walker were each to gain a fourth final win in 1947. Sonny Ward scored in the third consecutive final, taking his tally of cup final goals to four, and McCarthy added a hat-trick to his two goals in the previous season's final to take his overall total to a then-record five. The final was played in front of a record crowd of 8,000 spectators. Contemporary reports say that the final was the most one-sided in the cup's history up to that time. Despiute this, Mosgiel took an early lead with a second-minute goal from A. Sharpe. The equaliser came from Sonny Ward after 25 minutes, and from that point it became one-way traffic. Walker put Waterside into the lead and McCarthy added another only two minutes later. McCarthy added a further goal to give the Wharfies a 3-1 half-time lead. In the second half McCarthy added his third and then crossed the ball from a corner which Longbottom headed in for Waterside's sixth. Mosgiel gained a late consolation goal through W.

Built in 1860 for a member of a prominent local family, it is a good example of Italianate architecture, probably the work of noted local architect Alexander Rice Esty. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Paul Gibbs House stands in a rural area of northwestern Framingham, on the north side of Edmands Road, between Pine Hill and Nixon Roads. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a low-pitch hip roof and mostly clapboarded exterior. The roof has extended eaves, below which are shallow attic windows. The main facade is three bays wide, with a pair of projecting rectangular bays on either side of the main entrance. The entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a rounded transom window. A series of ells extends to the rear of the main block. The house was probably designed by architect Alexander Rice Esty, and built c. 1860 for Paul Gibbs. The attribution to Esty is based on surviving architectural elements that are similar to other documented works of his in Framingham. Gibbs was a member of the locally prominent Gibbs family, who had been major landowners of northwestern Framingham since the early 18th century, and the house was built around the time of his marriage. It is the last surviving house of a series of Gibbs family homes built in the area. The property associated with the house remained in use as farmland into the 1970s, although this house was converted in the 20th century for use as a tenant house by farm workers.

The oldest portion of the two- and-a-half story timber frame house dates to 1702, making it the oldest existing building in Hudson. George Francis Dow and John Goodale designed and built the house. It was later home to Goodale's various notable descendants. The house may have been a stop on the Underground Railroad. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History George Francis Dow and owner John Goodale designed and built the original 1702 portion of the Goodale Homestead in what was then Marlborough, Massachusetts. John Goodale was born in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1679 and died in 1752. When he died, the house passed to his only son Nathan Goodale (1709‚Äì1780). At least five generations of notable Goodales were born or lived at the homestead, including Nathan's only son Abner Goodale (1755‚Äì1823), a captain in the American Revolutionary War who fought at the Battle of White Plains and later a deacon. Abner and his wife Mary \\"Molly\\" Howe Goodale (1757‚Äì1818) had at least ten children. Their first son Nathan Goodale (1780‚Äì1848) became a schoolteacher while his younger brother David Goodale (1791‚Äì1858) followed in their father's footsteps as a deacon. Their youngest sister Lucy Goodale Thurston (1795‚Äì1876) became one of the first American Protestant missionaries in Hawaii. Both Nathan and David Goodale had large families. Though Nathan was the oldest son he decided David should be the house's owner and occupant, supposedly stating, \\"Thou art the one to remain. Our father was a deacon, you are also a deacon, and let remain as the Deacon Goodale farm.\\" David Goodale was an anti-slavery abolitionist who ran for Congress on the Free Soil Party ticket. The house therefore possibly served as a stop on the Underground Railroad prior to the American Civil War. David's son David Brainard Goodale (1822‚Äì1900) also became a deacon, making him the fifth generation of Goodales and third generation of deacons who were born or lived at the ancestral homestead. Most of the Goodale family is buried at Spring Hill Cemetery in Marlborough, which is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1955 then owner Mrs. Arthur Greenwood donated the house's northern ell to the Smithsonian Institution. When the Marlborough, Hudson, and Massachusetts Historical Commissions inventoried the house as a historic property in 1974, Mrs. Greenwood's estate owned it. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 21, 1975. Since 1975 the house has been owned by corporations established by Thurston Twigg-Smith, Hawaiian businessman and a great-great- grandson of Lucy Goodale Thurston. Architecture The original two-and-a- half story, wood frame central portion of the Goodale house dates to 1702. This main part of the house is sheathed with wood clapboards and includes an original stone chimney. The house's western ell and a brick chimney are later additions, though still predating the American Revolution. The extant lead glass windows and dentiled cornice are 1920s-era reproductions. A northern ell was removed in 1955. The property includes two existing barns. Historically, orchards and woodlots owned by the Goodale family surrounded the house. A small portion of this formerly agricultural landscape is preserved as the Goodale Memorial Forest, a publicly-accessible conservation area owned by the New England Forestry Foundation (NEFF). Goodale descendant Francis Goodale of Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, donated the forest to the NEFF in 1967.

The song has been sung by many other singers, such as Mireille Mathieu, too. Background The French journalist Jean Noli tells in his book \\"Edith\\" (Stock, 1973) the story about this song written by Charles Dumont and Michel Vaucaire. The story behind is that Dumont for a long time had tried to make Piaf interested in his compositions, but she had turned him down. She considered his songs too mediocre. But that changed after he had offered her Non, je ne regrette rien. In the middle of the night he was sent to Piaf's home. She wanted the Olympia- boss Bruno Coquatrix to listen to that song, and even Coquatrix was conquered. \\"Do you have another song?\\", Piaf asked Dumont.\\"Yes, he answered, but I don't know if it suits you.\\" \\"I'll listen to you. At last we'll listen to you.\\", said Piaf. He played it and sang the words. When he had finished there was a short silence.\\"The music is very beautiful, but the text is completely impossible. What is the name of the song?\\", Piaf asked. \\"Toulon-Le Havre- Anvers\\", answered Dumont. \\"Grotesque\\", said Piaf. \\"Completely ridiculous and stupid.

The station served the Northwest Florida and South Alabama areas.  History  Samuel F. (Sam) Townsend became the general manager and first announcer on WCNU radio station in Crestview, Florida in April, 1948. The station began broadcasting on a frequency of 1010 kHz on the AM dial with 1000 watts of power. WCNU operated from its studio in Radio Valley on State Road 85 south of the city limits. WCNU played a country-western format for its listeners in the Northwest Florida/South Alabama area. It was known as the \\"Community Station\\" and for playing \\"Dixie\\" before and after the news in the morning. The station was also known for signing off every evening to \\"Canadian Sunset.\\" In the late 1950s, WCNU and WDSP were owned and operated by W.D. \\"Cooter\\" Douglass and his wife, Marie. In 1959, citing his actions \\"in the spirit of emphasizing the public interest\\" and his \\"faithful reporting of the news and fearless comment thereon from Radio Stations WDSP, DeFuniak Springs and WCNU, Crestview\\", the Florida Legislature passed a resolution designating U.S. Route 90 passing through Walton and Okaloosa counties as the \\"William D. \\"Cooter\\" Douglass Highway.\\" In the early 1960s, Sam Townsend and Vernon Cooper formed a partnership and bought the station. Morning shows like \\"the Birthday Calendar\\" (folks called in to wish friends and relatives birthday greetings) and \\"the Trading Post\\" (forerunner of Craigslist) were daily staples for many in Okaloosa County. WCNU was purchased by Jerry W. Milligan, Sr. in the late 1970s. In 1980, Milligan changed the format of the station to light rock/pop music and, in September 1983, increased its power to 10,000 watts. The new format and high power significantly increased the station's listener appeal and listener area. WCNU went out of business in 1989. Licensed to Eagle International Broadcasting Inc., based in Pensacola, Florida, WCNU's final FCC license expired on February 1, 1996 and it was cancelled and deleted from the FCC database on August 29, 1996.

The district contains the famous Wayside Inn, a historic landmark inn that is reputedly the oldest continually operating inn in the country, opening as Howe's Tavern in 1716.Historic Homes and Genealogical memoirs of Early New England pg 281-283 publ 1909 by Ellery Bicknell Crane The district features Greek Revival and Colonial architecture. The area was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The Wayside Inn The inn's archive has documents from 1686 onward, including the official inn license granted to the first innkeeper, David Howe, in 1716. His son, Ezekiel Howe, was the next innkeeper and fought in the American Revolution with the Sudbury Minutemen. Lydia Howe, a granddaughter, was born in the Inn. The inn is also known as \\"Longfellow's Wayside Inn\\", a name given to the inn to capitalize on the popularity of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Tales of a Wayside Inn, a book of poems published in 1863. Longfellow visited the Wayside Inn in 1862, when it was called the \\"How Tavern\\". In his book Tales of a Wayside Inn, Longfellow republished his poem \\"Paul Revere's Ride\\" as \\"The Landlord's Tale\\". Two slaves are known to have lived at the inn: a man named \\"Portsmouth\\" and an unnamed girl were purchased in 1773 and 1779, respectively, by Ezekiel Howe. Henry Ford was the last private owner of the Wayside Inn. He purchased it in 1923, from Cora Lemon, and he also purchased 3,000 acres (12 km¬≤) of land surrounding the Inn, with the aim of developing it into a historically oriented village and museum. Although his original aims were not accomplished at the Wayside, he did establish the non-profit institution that operates the Inn and associated museum, watermill, and archives today. He also established the Wayside Inn Boys School, a trade school which operated from 1928-1947, aiming to demonstrate his belief that \\"the only way to really learn is by doing.\\"Henry Ford's Boys: the story of the Wayside Inn Boys School, Curtis F.

Retrieved May 2008. The inn is still in operation, offering a restaurant, historically accurate guest rooms, and hosting for small receptions. The original building burned down in 1955 and was rebuilt with many original beams and pieces shortly thereafter. A guest book (called at various times \\"Front Door Diaries\\" or \\"Hostess Diaries\\") was kept for many years, including observations of famous people who stayed or dined at the Inn, entries written by the guests, and newspaper clippings for context. Martha-Mary Chapel Henry Ford built a replica and fully working grist mill and a white non-denominational church, named after his mother, Mary, and mother in law, Martha. Less well known is Ford's attempt to create a reservoir for the Wayside Inn. Across US Rte. 20 and now secluded in a wooded area behind private homes is a 30 ft. high stone dam. Dubbed by the locals as \\"Ford's Folly\\" the structure failed to retain water because the feeding brook provided insufficient volume and the ground was too porous for a pond to fill. In the grounds of the church stands a one-room schoolhouse that was moved there from its original location in Sterling, Massachusetts by Ford, who believed the building was the actual schoolhouse mentioned in Sarah Josepha Hale's poem \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\", though little historical evidence exists to support his belief.

It includes 79 buildings on Silver Hill and Westland Roads, and Merriam Street. The area of Silver Hill and Westland Roads was formally laid out in 1905, while Merriam Street is a very old country road which had seen some development in the 1890s. The houses in the district are predominantly Colonial Revival and Queen Anne in their styling, a relative rarity in Weston although common in other Boston suburbs. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The Silver Hill neighborhood is located in northern Weston, south of North Street (Massachusetts Route 117) and the Silver Hill stop of the MBTA's Fitchburg Line commuter rail. The district extends along Merriam Street, which crosses the railroad line on an old wooden bridge, south to Westland Road. Just south of the railroad crossing, Silver Hill Road branches west, then curves south to flank the eponymous hill, reaching its end at Westland Road. The neighborhood is extended further west on Westland Road, an area which is excluded from the historic district due to a loss of historical integrity in many of its houses. The district is complete residential in character, occupying about with 41 historically significant houses, as well as a number of period barns and garages. Merriam Street is a road that dates to relatively early in the area's settlement history, but its northern end remained farmland until the 1890s. The Silver Hill railroad stop was opened in 1875, and helped spur residential development. The oldest house in the district, 227 Merriam Street, was built in 1892 for a worker at the Hook & Hastings Pipe Organ Company, whose plant was one stop east on the rail line. Land along Merriam Street was subdivided and built first, and in 1905 the Weston Land Company was formed by local owners and investors to plat and develop Silver Hill and Westland Roads. Although land was divided into lots of , many were sold as double lots, resulting in a relatively spacious development. Most of the houses built are either Queen Anne or Colonial Revival in character, and most were built by 1920.

It is located in the southern part of the town, and grew up around a series of mills that were located along Catacoonamug Brook, and then the railroad, which was built through the area in the 1840s. The district contains 441 properties. It is roughly bounded by Center, Harvard, Leominster and Shaker Roads. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The town of Shirley was settled in the 1720s and incorporated in 1775. Its colonial town center (recognized in the Shirley Center Historic District) was nearer its geographic center than Shirley Village. The village grew in the 19th century as an industrial site, overtaking the original center economically, and eventually also becoming the site of its main municipal buildings. Catacoonamug Brook, the source of its early power, was the site of a gristmill and sawmill as early as 1740. Lancaster Road, which passes through the village, was also the only major stagecoach route in the town, and the village was also where the Boston and Fitchburg Railroad was routed through in 1845. The village's dominant economic force thereafter were the cotton mills, of which the large building of the Phoenix Mills still stands. Residential growth on the south side of the railroad in the second half of the 19th century resulted in a large number of mainly vernacular wood frame residences. The focal point of the district is near its western end, where Leominster, Lancaster, and Harvard Roads meet with Main Street and Center Road in a series of intersections. The district radiates out for short distances along most of these roads, and more significantly to the east, along Front and Fredonia Streets and Ayer Road. There is one cemetery, the Village Cemetery on Harvard Road, established in 1849. Notable brick buildings in the district include several schoolhouses, the war memorial hall, and the library, a handsome Richardsonian Romanesque building trimmed in brownstone.

It is located at 26 Washington Street in Malden, Massachusetts and was built in 1913. The current building replaced an earlier 1871 building that now serves as the church's parish house. Some of the church's stained glass windows were created by the noted glass studio of Wilbur Herbert Burnham. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Its current minister is the Rev. John Clarke. Description and history St. Paul's Parish Church is located at the southwest corner of Washington and Florence Streets, west of downtown Malden's Main Street business district, and south of a residential area. It is a two- story rectangular structure, built out of ashlar granite stone in the Gothic Revival style. Its main entrance faces north toward Florence Street, recessed in a Gothic-arch opening, above which are a pair of tall Gothic windows. Smaller Gothic windows are elevated on either side of the entrance, with buttresses at the outer edge of the facade. The church is six bays deep, with buttresses separating paired Gothic windows. The building was designed by the noted proponent of the Gothic Revival, Ralph Adams Cram, and was completed in 1913. Its stained glass windows were provided by Wilbur Herbert Burnham, a frequent Cram collaborator. The congregation for which it was built was founded in 1861 and formally organized in 1867. It first met in a number of area halls, and its first church was built on an adjacent lot in 1872. Growth in the congregation prompted the need for a larger edifice, resulting in construction of the present building. The old church building now serves as the parish house.

The area was, until the arrival of the railroad in 1847, primarily known for its granite quarries. The railroad's arrival prompted the construction of an industrial mill by Charles G. Sargent, and the area developed rapidly thereafter. A significant amount of housing stock, as well as civic institutional buildings, were built during the second half of the 19th century. The district is bounded on the east by River Street and on the south by Bridge Street and North Main Street. The western edge of the district runs just before North Main Street's junction with West Street, northward and then eastward to encompass a number of quarry sites, before meeting North Main Street at River Street.

Navigation Catalyst Systems was a subsidiary of New.net and an affiliate of the ICANN-accredited registrar Basic Fusion.  Lawsuit  In 2007, Navigation Catalyst Systems, along with its affiliate registrar Basic Fusion, was sued by Verizon for the registration and domain tasting of 1,392 domain names incorporating Verizon's trademarks (Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems, Inc., 2008 WL 2651163 (C.D. Cal. June 30, 2008). Navigation argued that it did not register the domain names in bad faith because it had used a proprietary software tool that, through both manual and automatic means, \\"scrubbed\\" its registered domains for registered trademarks. It claimed that it was merely \\"reserving\\" the domain names by taking advantage of Basic Fusion's Add Grace Period. Basic Fusion attempted to argue that it was not the same legal entity as Navigation Catalyst Systems, but the court stated that they were the same for the purposes of a preliminary injunction motion. Navigation further asserted an unclean hands defense, arguing that Verizon used a similar pay-per-click program to monetize its wildcard DNS records. The court rejected both arguments and ultimately granted a preliminary injunction against Navigation Catalyst Systems. In so doing, the court held that Navigation Catalyst Systems had intended to profit in bad faith from the typographical errors of Internet users that mistyped Verizon's trademarks in the URL bar of their web browsers: > It is clear that their intent was to profit from the poor typing abilities > of consumers trying to reach Plaintiffs' sites: what other value could there > be in a name like ve3rizon.com?

The district's houses are reminders of a period when the area was rural farmland along one of the oldest roads in town. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Gowing‚ÄìSheldon House The Gowing‚ÄìSheldon House at 642 Woburn Street is a Federal style wood frame house built c. 1809. Like many period houses, it faces south and rests on a granite foundation; however, it is only four bays wide and one bay deep. There is a rear ell perpendicular to the main house that was added sometime before the turn of the 20th century, and has been modified since, based on photographic evidence. This ell connects the house to a 19th-century barn. This house was built by Joel Tweed, a cordwainer who bought the property in 1809 and sold it, with house, in 1819. It was acquired in 1920 by John Gowing, who is reported in local histories to have raised a large family there. He sold the property in 1864 to Horace Sheldon, whose family owned the property until 1898. Lucy and Henry Sheldon House In 1892, Lucy Sheldon purchased land across the street from the Sheldon house from her father-in-law, Henry, who was Horace's brother. The house that Lucy and Henry, Jr. had constructed in 1893 is one of the most elaborate Queen Anne houses in Wilmington. The house has cross gables expanding the third floor, its gables decorated with cut shingles and heavy brackets. A single story porch is decorated with turned posts and jigsaw brackets. The entry is highlighted by a gable end decorated with a starburst. In the back of the property is a carriage house, which carries on the Queen Anne styling.

Wildlife Endangered wildlife in the refuge are red-cockaded woodpecker, bald eagle and brown pelican. Other wildlife include rabbit, turkey, various neo-tropical birds, deer, squirrel, migratory waterfowl, and wading birds. Habitat The refuge has unique habitat zones that contain diverse combinations of plant communities. These zones begin with the sandy beach fringing Lake Pontchartrain. Moving inland, the next zone is the brackish marsh. The third zone has a water level that is slightly below the marsh floor and the predominate plants are wiregrass and spike rush. The farthest inland plant zone is the upland zone and it consists of pine flatwoods and bottomland hardwood hammocks. Hurricane damage The facilities at Big Branch Marsh NWR were damaged by Hurricane Katrina. The Boy Scout Road Trail boardwalk was destroyed but a new and improved boardwalk was built in early 2007. The other facilities on the refuge have been repaired or rebuilt. Sections of marsh vegetation were damaged and thousands of trees were destroyed or damaged. We planted trees on the refuge in 2006, 2007, and 2008.

A gas pycnometer is also sometimes referred to as a helium pycnometer. Types of gas pycnometer=Gas expansion pycnometer Gas expansion pycnometer is also known as constant volume gas pycnometer. The simplest type of gas pycnometer (due to its relative lack of moving parts) consists of two chambers, one (with a removable gas-tight lid) to hold the sample and a second chamber of fixed, known (via calibration) internal volume ‚Äì referred to as the reference volume or added volume. The device additionally comprises a valve to admit a gas under pressure to one of the chambers, a pressure measuring device ‚Äì usually a transducer ‚Äì connected to the first chamber, a valved pathway connecting the two chambers, and a valved vent from the second of the chambers. In practice the sample may occupy either chamber, that is gas pycnometers can be constructed such that the sample chamber is pressurized first, or such that it is the reference chamber that starts at the higher pressure. Various design parameters have been analyzed by Tamari.S. Tamari (2004) Meas. Sci. Technol. 15 549‚Äì558 \\"Optimum design of the constant- volume gas pycnometer for determining the volume of solid particles\\" The working equation of a gas pycnometer wherein the sample chamber is pressurized first is as follows: ::V_{s} = V_{c} + \\\\frac{ V_{r}} {1-\\\\frac{P_{1}}{P_{2}}} where Vs is the sample volume, Vc is the volume of the empty sample chamber (known from a prior calibration step), Vr is the volume of the reference volume (again known from a prior calibration step), P1 is the first pressure (i.e. in the sample chamber only) and P2 is the second (lower) pressure after expansion of the gas into the combined volumes of sample chamber and reference chamber. Derivation of the \\"working equation\\" and a schematic illustration of such a gas expansion pycnometer is given by Lowell et al..S. Lowell, J.E. Shields, M.A. Thomas and M. Thommes \\"Characterization of Porous Solids and Powders: Surface Area, Pore Size and Density\\", Springer (originally by Kluwer Academic Publishers), 2004 p. 327 Variable volume pycnometer Variable volume pycnometer (or gas comparison pycnometer) consists of either a single or two variable volume chambers. The sample cell volume can be at different types and size, like G-DenPyc 2900 technology specified, the volume can be 0.1ml up to 500ml. The volume of the chamber(s) can be varied by either a fixed amount by a simple mechanical piston of fixed travel, or continuously and gradually by means of a graduated piston. Resulting changes in pressure can be read by means of a transducer, or nullified by adjustment of a third ancillary, graduated variable-volume chamber. This type of pycnometer is commercially obsolete; in 2006 ASTM withdrew its standard test method D2856ASTM D2856-94(1998) Standard Test Method for Open-Cell Content of Rigid Cellular Plastics by the Air Pycnometer (withdrawn in 2006). for the open-cell content of rigid cellular plastics by the air pycnometer, which relied upon the use of a variable volume pycnometer, and was replaced by test method D6226ASTM D6226-05 Standard Test Method for Open Cell Content of Rigid Cellular Plastics. which describes a gas expansion pycnometer. Practical use=Volume vs density While pycnometers (of any type) are recognized as density measuring devices they are in fact devices for measuring volume only. Density is merely calculated as the ratio of mass to volume; mass being invariably measured on a discrete device, usually by weighing. The volume measured in a gas pycnometer is that amount of three-dimensional space which is inaccessible to the gas used, i.e. that volume within the sample chamber from which the gas is excluded. Therefore, the volume measured considering the finest scale of surface roughness will depend on the atomic or molecular size of the gas. Helium therefore is most often prescribed as the measurement gas, not only is it of small size, it is also inert and the most ideal gas. Closed pores, i.e. those that do not communicate with the surface of the solid, are included in the measured volume. Helium may however demonstrate some measurable permeability through low density solids (polymers and cellulosic materials predominantly) thus interfering with the measurement of solid volume. In such cases larger molecule gases such as nitrogen or sulfur hexafluoride are beneficial. Adsorption of the measuring gas should be avoided, as should excessive vapor pressure from moisture or other liquids present in the otherwise solid sample. Applications Gas pycnometers are used extensively for characterizing a wide variety of solids such as heterogeneous catalysts, carbons, DIN 51913 Testing of carbon materials ‚Äì Determination of density by gas pycnometer (volumetric) using helium as the measuring gas metal powders,ASTM B923-02(2008)Standard Test Method for Metal Powder Skeletal Density by Helium or Nitrogen PycnometryMPIF Standard 63: Method for Determination of MIM Components (Gas Pycnometer) soils,ASTM D5550 -06 Standard Test Method for Specific Gravity of Soil Solids by Gas Pycnometer ceramics,ASTM C604 Standard Test Method for True Specific Gravity of Refractory Materials by Gas-Comparison Pycnometer active pharmaceutical ingredients (API's) and excipients,USP<699> \\"Density of Solids\\" petroleum coke,ASTM D2638 ‚Äì 06 Standard Test Method for Real Density of Calcined Petroleum Coke by Helium Pycnometer cement and other construction materials,C.

Built c. 1726, it is a well-preserved late First Period, including a rare surviving stairway balustrade from the period. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Hapgood House is set on the east side of Treaty Elm Lane, a rural residential dead-end street in central Stow, near a stream that descends to the Assabet River. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, large central chimney, and clapboard siding. A leanto section was added to the rear, giving the house a saltbox profile, and an ell extends to the right. The front eave is deeper than is typical for the period. The front rooms of the first floor have exposed beams with quirk beading, a late First Period feature, and the left room's fireplace includes the remains of a beehive oven. The entrance vestibule has a narrow winding staircase, with its original balustrade, a feature that rarely survives from houses of this period. The upstairs front chambers were probably plastered, also a late First Period feature. In the upper level of the leanto section, original exterior siding is visible, indicating the leanto was added later. The oldest portion of this 2-1/2 story timber frame house was probably built c. 1726, not long after Hezekiah Hapgood's marriage. It has a history of 200 years of association with his descendants.
