Completed in late 1942, she was transferred to France in July 1943. T25 was unsuccessfully attacked by Allied motor torpedo boats and aircraft during her voyage down the English Channel and then came to the aid of a convoy being attacked by Allied destroyers. Later that year she escorted blockade runners and Axis submarines through the Bay of Biscay. T25 also helped to lay minefields in the English Channel in mid-1943. She participated in the Battle of Sept-√éles in October and was sunk two months later by British light cruisers during the Battle of the Bay of Biscay. Design and description The Type 39 torpedo boat was conceived as a general-purpose design, much larger than preceding German torpedo boats.Whitley 1991, p. 52 The boats had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. They had a beam of , a draft of at deep load and displaced at standard load and at deep load.Gr√∂ner, p. 195 Their crew numbered 206 officers and sailors.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 239 The Type 39s were fitted with a pair of geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller, using steam from four high-pressure water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce which was intended give the ships a maximum speed of . They carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at .Whitley 1991, pp. 54, 203 As built, the Type 39 ships mounted four SK C/32 guns in single mounts protected by gun shields; one forward of the superstructure, one between the funnels, and two aft, one superfiring over the other. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by four SK C/30 AA guns in two twin-gun mounts on platforms abaft the rear funnel, six C/38 guns in one quadruple mount on the aft superstructure and a pair of single mounts on the bridge wings. They carried six above-water torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships and could also carry 30 mines; the full complement of 60 mines made the ships top-heavy which could be dangerous in bad weather. For anti-submarine work the boats were fitted with a S-Ger√§t sonar and four depth charge launchers. The Type 39s were equipped with a FuMO 21 radar and various FumB radar detectors were installed late in the war.Friedman, p. 205; Whitley 1991, pp. 52‚Äì55; Whitley 2000, p. 73 Construction and career Originally ordered as a Type 37 torpedo boat on 30 March 1939, T25 was reordered on 10 November 1939 from Schichau. The boat was laid down on 30 November 1940 at their Elbing, East Prussia, shipyard as yard number 1484, launched on 1 December 1941 and commissioned on 12 November 1942. After working up until June 1943, on 3 July T25 and her sister departed for Western France. On the morning of 5 July, the sisters were unsuccessfully attacked by three Dutch-manned motor torpedo boats and shelled by British coastal artillery. After reaching Boulogne harbor, they were attacked by Hawker Typhoon fighters on 6 July which were equally unsuccessful. The boats sailed shortly after midnight on 7 July, bound for Le Havre where they arrived without being attacked. On the night of 9/10 July, on passage between Saint- Malo and Brest, they were tasked to provide distant cover for a convoy that was escorted by five minesweepers off Ushant. The convoy was attacked by the British destroyers , and the Norwegian-manned which sank one of the minesweepers and damaged another before T25 and T24 could arrive. The sisters heavily damaged Melbreak before the Allied ships disengaged. Now assigned to the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, the torpedo boats were tasked to help escort U-boats through the Bay. On 2 August T25, T24 and their sister , responding to a distress call from another submarine, rescued survivors from the submarine . From 29 to 31 August, the same three boats escorted the through the Bay to Lorient.Hervieux, pp. 96‚Äì97; Rohwer, pp. 256‚Äì257, 259, 269; Whitley 1991, pp. 144‚Äì145, 212 T25 helped to lay minefields in the Channel from 3 to 5 September. While providing distant cover for a small convoy during the night of 3/4 October, the 4th Flotilla spotted a force of five British destroyers off the Sept-√éles near the coast of Brittany in the Channel and attacked with torpedoes with complete surprise. The first volley of five torpedoes all missed, but the British did not see them and continued on their course. Only when T23 turned on her radar to determine the range for a second volley did they react when one of the British destroyers detected the radar; they altered course just in time for the second volley of torpedoes to miss. Two of the British ships were able to pursue the retreating Germans at high speed, but both were damaged by German gunfire and forced to disengage.Hervieux, p. 97; Rohwer, pp. 270, 279; Whitley 1991, p. 147 Battle of Sept-√éles On 22 October, the 4th Flotilla, now consisting of T25, T22, T23, and their sisters and , sortied from Brest to provide cover for the unladen blockade runner M√ºnsterland and her close escort from the 2nd Minesweeping Flotilla as they sailed up the Channel. The British were aware of M√ºnsterland and attempted to intercept her on the night of the 23rd with a scratch force that consisted of the light cruiser and the destroyers , , , Wensleydale, and . T22s hydrophones detected the British ships off the Sept-√éles at 00:25 and Korvettenkapit√§n Franz Kohlauf maneuvered his flotilla to intercept them before they could reach M√ºnsterland. Limbourne overheard the radio transmissions about 01:20 as the German ships turned and alerted the other British ships. At 01:36 Charybdiss radar detected the German torpedo boats at a range of and she fired star shells in an unsuccessful attempt to spot them visually. About this time, T23 spotted Charybdis silhouetted against the lighter horizon and Kohlauf ordered every boat to fire all of their torpedoes. Two of these struck the cruiser, which sank shortly afterwards, and another blew the bow off Limbourne, which had to be scuttled later. None of these torpedoes were fired by T25 as her partially trained torpedo officer did not react in time. The loss of the flagship threw the British into confusion as they had not worked together before the attack, and the torpedo boats successfully disengaged before the senior surviving British captain realized that he was in command.Hervieux, pp. 97‚Äì98; Rohwer, p. 282; Whitley, pp. 147‚Äì148 Battle of the Bay of Biscay Alsterufer burning after a RAF attack On 24‚Äì26 December T25 was one of the escorts for the blockade runner through the Bay of Biscay. Another blockade runner, the refrigerated cargo ship , trailed Osorno by several days and four destroyers of the 8th Destroyer Flotilla and the six torpedo boats of the 4th Flotilla set sail on 27 December to escort her through the Bay. The Allies were aware of these blockade runners through their Ultra code-breaking efforts and positioned cruisers and aircraft in the Western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. A Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber from No. 311 Squadron RAF sank Alsterufer later that afternoon.Rohwer, pp. 294‚Äì295; Whitley, p. 149 A sketch of the rescue drawn by Hans Helmut Karsch, while interned in the Curragh Camp (note the Irish tricolours on the Kerlogue) ‚Äì National Maritime Museum of Ireland The German ships were unaware of the sinking until the following afternoon and continued onward to the rendezvous point. They had been spotted by an American Liberator bomber on the morning of the 28th and the British light cruisers and , which were assigned to Stonewall, maneuvered to intercept them. By this time, the weather had gotten significantly worse and the German ships were steaming for home, hampered by the rough seas that threw sea spray over their forward guns which made their operation difficult. It also severely reduced visibility and hampered the rangefinders and sights for the guns and torpedoes. Using her radar, Glasgow was the first to open fire at 13:46 at a range of with Enterprise following a few minutes later. About that time, the destroyers began firing back with guns and torpedoes; the latter all missed and one hit was made on Glasgow at 14:05. Kapit√§n zur See (Captain) Hans Erdmenger, commander of the 8th Flotilla, decided to split his forces and ordered the destroyers , , and T22, T25 and T26 to reverse course to the north at 14:18. The cruisers pursued them with Enterprise crippling Z27 and Glasgow engaging T25. At 14:54 the cruiser began to make multiple hits on T25, killing the crews of the aft torpedo tubes, the quadruple 2 cm gun mount and the 3.7 cm guns. They also stopped one turbine and severed the oil pipes supplying after engine room, causing the boat to lose speed. Another hit blew the foremast and the forward funnel overboard and knocked out electrical power. At 15:10 T25 fired her forward torpedoes without effect. Her captain requested that T22 come alongside and rescue his crew, but Glasgows intense fire prevented her from complying. The cruiser switched targets to T26 shortly afterwards, leaving T24 drifting by herself with some hope of restarting one turbine. At 16:35 Enterprise reappeared and closed to a range of , despite sporadic firing from the German guns, which were almost out of ammunition, before firing one torpedo that caused T25 to founder at 16:46 with the loss of 85 crewmen. The survivors were rescued by , which picked up 34 men from T25; several hundred other survivors from Z27, T25 and T26 were rescued by the Irish merchantman , the British minesweeper and two Spanish destroyers, but the precise breakdown of which survivors belong to which ship is not available.Gr√∂ner, p. 195; Hervieux, pp. 98‚Äì99; Rohwer, p. 295; Whitley 1991, pp. 149‚Äì153 NotesCitationsReferences * * * * * * * External links * T25 at german navy.de Category:Type 39 torpedo boats Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean Category:Maritime incidents in December 1943 Category:1941 ships Category:Ships built by Schichau Category:Ships built in Elbing ","title":"German torpedo boat T25"},{"id":"31607473","text":"Enneanectes boehlkei, known commonly as the roughhead triplefin, is a species of triplefin blenny.

The co-stardom network can be represented by an undirected graph of nodes and links. Nodes correspond to the movie star actors and two nodes are linked if they co-starred (performed) in the same movie. The links are un-directed, and can be weighted or not depending on the goals of study. If the number of times two actors appeared in a movie is needed, links are assigned weights. The co-stardom network can also be represented by a bipartite graph where nodes are of two types: actors and movies. And edges connect different types of nodes (i.e. actors to movies) if they have a relationship (actors in a movie). Initially the network was found to have a small-world property. Afterwards, it was discovered that it exhibits a scale-free (power-law) behavior. The parlor game of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon involves finding paths in this network from specified actors to Kevin Bacon.  Network representation  In order to represent any network, it is necessary to characterize the properties of the corresponding graph of nodes and links. Studies on the collaboration network of movie actors have been described in literature such as the work done by (Watts and Strogatz, 1998), and Barab√°si and Albert in (1999) and (2000). The general characteristics are described below. * According to Watts and Strogatz (1998), the movie/actor network indicated the following characteristics showing a small-world property of the underlying network: :Size: 225 226 :Average degree: 61 :Average path length: 3.65 :Clustering coefficient: 0.79 Compared to a random graph of the same size and average degree, the average path length is close in value. However, the clustering coefficient is much higher for the movie actor network. * The network characteristics and scaling exponents given by Barab√°si and Albert (1999), indicates the scale-free behavior: :Size: 212 250 :Average degree: 28.78 :Cutoff for power-law scaling: 900 :Clustering coefficient: 0.79 Therefore, the underlying network has the scale-free degree distribution p(k) ~ k‚àíŒ≥actor, with an exponent Œ≥actor = 2.3 ¬± 0.1 (Barab√°si and Albert, 1999), (Albert and Barab√°si, 2000). * According to (Newman, Strogatz, and Watts, 2001), the movie actor network can be described by a bipartite graph. Nodes in this graph are of two types: movies and actors. And the edges only connect nodes of different types. So edges link the co- stars to the movie they appear in. Therefore, the collaboration graph of film actors can be constructed using a transformation matrix of the bipartite graph interaction matrix.  Data collection The Internet Movie Database IMDB represents one of the largest internet sources for movies/actors data. And it is where most of the datasets are collected to study the collaboration network of co-star actors. IMDB facilitates the ability to collect data for very specific and variable types of network. For example, a network can be constructed using data from all the horror movies made within a specific time period (ex. 2000‚Äì2010) and only picking the top three co-stars in each movie.

The gallery is operated by the Shire of Wellington, and is located at the Port of Sale, 70 Foster Street, Sale. The Gallery exhibits art of all media, styles and periods, but has a focus on the natural environment and artists based in Gippsland. The Gallery also incorporates the Maffra Exhibition Space, an access gallery available for local artists and artist groups, located at 150 Johnson Street, Maffra.  History  The Gallery was formerly opened on 25 September 1965 by Rupert Hamer. Originally named the Sale Regional Art Centre, it was built above the Sale Library at 82 Macalister Street, Sale. Construction of the Gallery was funded by a State Government grant of ¬£20,000, with the Sale City Council contributing a further ¬£10,000. An intensive program of temporary exhibitions was organised, complete with educational materials, and the institution soon became an important resource centre for schools, arts and crafts groups and the public, covering the whole area of Central and East Gippsland. In 1989 the Gallery was relocated from 82 Macalister Street after blue asbestos was reported as being present in the ceiling. The Gallery moved between several temporary locations before settling at 288 Raymond Street, Sale. In 1995 the Gallery relocated again to 70 Foster Street, Sale, and changed its name to the Gippsland Art Gallery. Between 2015 and 2017 the Gallery underwent a major redevelopment to improve facilities and increase exhibition space. The new fit out was designed by FJMT Architects, Melbourne, and opened to the public on 6 January 2018. The Gallery has six exhibition spaces over 800sqm, including a space dedicated to Sale-based textile artist Annemieke Mein, which rotates displays three times annually. The Gallery has presented a number of significant exhibitions throughout its history. Important exhibitions include 'From Frederick McCubbin to Charles McCubbin' (2008), which explored the creative legacy of the McCubbin Family; 'Lost Highways' (2009), the first major survey exhibition of work by Melbourne artist Tony Lloyd; and 'Disappearers' (2009), which explored the absent figure in the work of eight contemporary Australian photographers. The Gallery has also presented major exhibitions of work by William Delafield Cook, Robbie Rowlands, Kylie Stillman, Sam Jinks, Charles McCubbin, Annemieke Mein and Jane Burton. In 2011 the Gallery presented the first ever comprehensive survey of work by Russian- born Swiss artist Nicholas Chevalier (1828‚Äì1902). The exhibition coincided with the release of a major publication by Curator Simon Gregg, which includes a detailed catalogue raisonne of Chevalier's Australian works. The exhibition later toured to Geelong Art Gallery. To date the Gallery has had seven Directors: Gwen Webb OAM (1976‚Äì1990); Giacomina Pradolin (1990‚Äì1991); Anthony Dahlitz (1992); Judy Miles (1993‚Äì1994); Michael Young (1994‚Äì2005); Anton Vardy (2005‚Äì2017); and Simon Gregg (2018‚Äìpresent).  The Gallery today  The Gallery currently presents approximately thirty-five exhibitions annually, across the Gippsland Art Gallery, Sale, and the Maffra Exhibition Space. The Gallery hosts two biennial prize exhibitions: the John Leslie Art Prize for landscape painting (presented every even year); and the Gippsland Print Award (presented every odd year). The John Leslie Art Prize is a $20,000 acquisitive award, whose past winners include David Keeling (2000), Vera M√∂ller (2002), Mark McCarthy (2004), Brigid Cole-Adams (2006), Andrew Mezei (2008), Jason Cordero (2010), Tony Lloyd (2012), Shannon Smiley (2014), and Amelda Read- Forsythe (2016). The Award is named after the late John Leslie OBE, former Patron of the Gallery and Mayor of Sale. The Gippsland Print Award is a $5,000 acquisitive open-entry award for printmaking. The winners to date have been Martin King (2015) and Jock Clutterbuck (2017). To mark its fiftieth birthday, in 2015 the Gallery published 'Hindsight: Gippsland Art Gallery History & Collections, 1965‚Äì2015'. Written and compiled by Simon Gregg, the 446-page book chronicles the history of the Gallery, collection highlights, and a complete collection catalogue.  Permanent collection  Gippsland Art Gallery is home to a permanent collection of approximately 1,750 items, consisting of paintings, works on paper, ceramics, sculpture, textiles, woodwork and metalwork. The collection has a focus on the natural environment, and specifically Gippsland artists and Gippsland themes. The collection includes works by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Jan Hendrik Scheltema, Peter Booth, Rodney Forbes, Victor Majzner, Clive Murray-White, Rosemary Laing, Tony Lloyd, Polixeni Papapetrou, Annemieke Mein, Charles Rolando, Ann Greenwood, Andrew Browne, and Sam Leach. The Gallery is also home to the Esso Australia Collection of Australian Art, a significant collection of artworks spanning the breadth of the twentieth century, which were donated to the Gallery in 2018. A rotating display of artworks from the collection is on permanent display at the Gallery.

Madhusudan Dey (Modhu), the canteen's founder, is an equally important figure in the socio-political history of the region. He was killed on 25 March 1971 at the beginning of the Bangladesh Liberation War. As part of Operation Searchlight, the Pakistan Army attacked the Dhaka University. Madhusudan Dey was taken to Jagannath Hall by the Pakistani armed forces where he was executed along with many university students. After the Liberation War, Arun Kumar Dey assumed the responsibility of running the canteen.http://www.daily-sun.com/post/133002/DU- cafeterias:-cheapest-rate-highest-pleasure- Years after Modhu's death, the canteen remains a significant landmark and also a place for gathering in the community.http://www.thedailystar.net/news/the-legacy-of-madhus-canteen  History of the canteen Memorial to Madhusudan Dey at the canteen Origin Madhur Canteen was started in 1921, when Madhusudan Dey (Modhu) came to Dhaka with his father, Aditya Chandra, at the age of 15. Aditya Chandra, with the permission of the university authorities, began selling food in the Dhaka University Campus which was, at the time, located in the present Dhaka Medical College building. The canteen was shifted later when the Arts Faculty of the university was shifted to a new building at Nilkhet. Madhur canteen played a pivotal role in the Bangladesh Liberation Movement. It was the focal point for the start of various political movements in the country. The canteen played a significant part in the Language Movements of 1948 and 1952, the movement of fourth-class Dhaka University employees in 1949, the student's revolt against the black laws (kala kanoon) of the university, and the 1969 mass uprising in East Pakistan. During these critical political moments, Madhur Canteen was a social epicentre frequented by student leaders and activists. The Pakistani army targeted Madhur Canteen on 25 March 1971, with the beginning of operation Searchlight. Massacre Madhusudan Dey was killed on 26 March 1971. The Pakistani military stormed his house and started firing in the early morning hours. Dey's wife, son and daughter-in-law were amongst those killed. Madhusudan Dey was injured in the firing, arrested and taken to the Jagannath Hall playground where he was killed alongside many students. Madhur Canteen  Present location  The Jalsaghar buildings in 1904. Madhur Canteen was reconstructed after suffering severe damage during the liberation war. The canteen was relocated from its original location in the present-day Dhaka Medical college building to an old structure. The canteen's present location served as the Durbar Hall of the Dhaka Nawabs. Apart from being used as a venue for formal and informal meetings, it also served as a skating rink and ballroom for the enjoyment of the Nawabs. Construction of the building began in 1873 which continued over several years. In 1906, a conference was held in the building, sponsored by Nawab Khwaja Salimullah, the Nawab of Dhaka that led to the formation of the All-India Muslim League. Toufiq Hosen Khan, a student of fine arts, engraved a statue of Madhusudan Dey in 1995, which remains in front of the Madhur Canteen to the present day.

His name is closely associated with the exploration and rediscovery of medieval music in the 20th century, particularly the compositional techniques of the Ars Nova and the isorhythmic motet. Life Ludwig was born in Potsdam, and after completing the abitur at the Victoria-Gymnasium (Now Helmholtz-Gymnasium, Potsdam), he studied historiography with Harry Bresslau at the University of Strasbourg, where he earned a doctorate in 1896. He owed his musical education on one hand to Gustav Jacobsthal, the only full-time professor of historical musicology in Germany at the time, and on the other hand to philosopher-organist Albert Schweitzer and composer Hans Pfitzner, both of whom he met in Strasbourg where he settled. For about a decade, Ludwig made numerous trips throughout Europe to investigate the sources of medieval music. He joined the faculty of Strasbourg University upon Jacobsthal's retirement in 1905, first as a lecturer, and in 1910 as an associate professor of music history. He was expelled from Strasbourg when it fell into French hands at the end of the First World War. In 1920, he became an associate professor at the University of G√∂ttingen, where he served as Rector in 1929/30. Works Friedrich Ludwig belonged to the school of thought among cultural historians that did not ascribe to the Romantic view that Baroque Polyphony was the only type of polyphony of highest worth; rather, he sought to explore its historical development and evolution, leading to a critical reassessment of earlier music. These researches have made the practice and theory of music of the Middle Ages accessible. His research area was music before Palestrina-style polyphony; namely, the Ars Antiqua, Ars Nova, and the polyphony of the Franco- Flemish school. As a historian, Ludwig was already familiar with the cultural unity of Europe in the Late Middle Ages, and he approached it through the narrative and source-based methodology of Leopold von Ranke, of whom Ludwig's teacher Bresslau was a disciple. These methods had, for instance, moved Slavic cultures into a new perspective. In contrast to the prevailing view among music historians of the 19th century - a view epitomized in Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's Phenomenology of the Spirit (1807) asserting that music is an art in and of itself, Ludwig followed a systematic method to explore the relationships between music and other cultural phenomena such as architecture and literature, finding in it unity through the poetry of medieval languages. For this purpose, he used the philology of High Middle German, the Romance languages, and medieval Latin, the chorale, and historic chronicles. He made stylistic comparison of primary sources to date musical works, and introduced these methods to music historiography. Ludwig's contributions to musical scholarship include his investigations into Organum, deciphering early neumatic notation (square note notation), the discovery of Rhythmic modes in the unison songs of the 13th century, and the systematic representation of compositions of the Notre Dame School and the motets of the Ars Nova. He transcribed many multi-part works of the 15th century and published them in critical editions. Ludwig discovered the compositional principal of isorhythm ‚Äì a term he coined. He also coined the term Stimmtausch.  Selected bibliography  * Die mehrstimmige Musik des 14.

Alden in Middleborough, Massachusetts. Alden specializes in handcrafted men's leather boots and dress shoes, such as Oxfords, Bl√ºchers, loafers, and Chukka boots. In the 19th century, there were once hundreds of shoemakers in New England, but now Alden is one of only a few factories. Alden is considered a heritage, family-owned brand. Many of the company's roughly 100 workers at its factory in Middleborough are second or third generation, and it sources its leathers mostly from small tanneries in Europe and the U.S. - its shell cordovan comes from the last such tannery in America, Horween Leather Company. Alden has used Horween as their leather supplier since 1930, and is their largest cordovan customer. Along with other brands of Americana, Alden has experienced something of a resurgence in 21st century men's fashion. Despite a recession in the late-2000s and the relatively high prices of their products, Alden has grown again because of a renewed interest in more traditional men's shoes and boots, which can last decades. It is this reliance on high-end shoes, especially by those interested in business attire, that has allowed the company to avoid going under despite the decline of American shoe manufacturing. In popular culture, Alden model 405 boots (commonly referred to as the Alden \\"Indy\\" boot) were the shoe of choice for Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones character in the film versions of the franchise.

Before taking the Princeton job in 2011, he served as an assistant for the Northwestern Wildcats men's basketball team for 11 seasons under Bill Carmody. Henderson was a member of three consecutive Ivy League championship Princeton teams as a player (two of which went undefeated in conference, the first tying the school record with 19 consecutive wins and the second achieving 20). He was a co-captain of the second of these undefeated league champions along with Steve Goodrich. Early life Born in Vincennes, Indiana, Henderson later lived in Lexington, Kentucky as a teenager and attended Culver Military Academy in Culver for high school. Henderson was a twelve-time varsity letter winner at Culver in football, basketball and baseball. In 1994, he was drafted by the New York Yankees with the 24th pick of the 29th round, 815th overall in the 1994 Major League Baseball draft. In baseball, he was a pitcher. He was named the 1994 South Bend Tribune high school Male Athlete of the Year. He did not sign with the Yankees and retained his amateur status although he chose to pursue basketball rather than baseball in college. As a basketball player, he was a four-year starter at Princeton University, where he was captain of the Ivy League champion 1997‚Äì98 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team as well as a member of the 1995‚Äì96 and 1996‚Äì97 conference champions. The latter two teams were undefeated in conference play and were coached by Carmody. The 1995‚Äì96 team was notable for its upset of the defending national champion UCLA Bruins in the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The 1996‚Äì97 team finished the regular season on a school record 19-game winning streak. In the 1997 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, against the fifth-seeded , the team lost 55‚Äì52. Henderson had tied the score at 50 with 1:37 to play. Henderson was a 1997 honorable mention All-Ivy League selection. The 1997‚Äì98 team posted a 27‚Äì2 overall record, reached the top 10 in the national polls, and achieved a 14‚Äì0 conference record. The Tigers entered the 1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament on a 19-game winning streak and finished the season ranked eighth in the final USAToday/NABC Coaches Poll. He was a 1998 2nd team All-Ivy League selection. In the 1998 tournament opening game for the fifth-seeded Tigers, he scored 19 points to help them defeat the 69‚Äì57, which marked the team's 20th consecutive win‚Äîa school record. He was briefly a member of the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association during the 1998‚Äì99 NBA season, but he did not appear in any regular season games. He also played professional basketball in Sligo, Ireland, from August 1998 to January 1999. Coaching career Henderson served as an assistant to his former coach Carmody during Carmody's first eleven seasons as the coach at Northwestern University. Carmody used Henderson, who commonly scrimmaged with the players, as part of a joke for a Sports Illustrated: \\"I don't mind that Mitch is cagier and smarter than all those guys on the court. The thing that bothers me is that he's faster than all of them.\\" During Henderson's final three seasons at Northwestern, the team qualified for the National Invitation Tournament. Henderson was selected to replace outgoing Princeton head coach Sydney Johnson. He inherited a 2010‚Äì11 team that narrowly lost to Kentucky in its opening game of the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The team returned its 2nd leading scorer and rebounder, Ian Hummer, who as a sophomore was a 2nd team All-Ivy selection. With a new head coach who is a first-time head coach, the 2011‚Äì12 Tigers got off to a slow start with a 1‚Äì5 record, but won 18 of its final 24 games and started its conference schedule with a 2‚Äì3 record, but won 8 of its final 9 games. Eventually, Princeton earned its first home win against a ranked opponent since the 1976‚Äì77 team's January 3, 1977 victory over Notre Dame by defeating Harvard (No. 21 Coaches/25 AP) on February 11, 2012. The win was also its first against a ranked opponent on any court since November 11, 1997, which is when the 1997‚Äì98 team opened its season with a victory over a ranked Texas team at Meadowlands Arena (now named Izod Center) in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Princeton also defeated eventual 2012 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament Champion Florida State five weeks after Harvard did. The team qualified for the 2012 CBI Tournament and earned a first round 95‚Äì86 victory over Evansville. In the subsequent game against Pittsburgh, Princeton lost 82-61 to end the season. The 2012‚Äì13 Tigers finished with a 17-11 (10-4) record on the season. . The 2013‚Äì14 team lost in the second round of the 2nd Round CBI to finish with a 21-9 (8-6) record. In his sixth season, he earned unanimous recognition as Ivy League Coach of the Year for the 2016‚Äì17 Tigers. On December 29, 2018 the 2018‚Äì19 Princeton Tigers team defeated the number 17-ranked Arizona State 67-66. It was Princeton's first win over a ranked opponent since defeating the 25-ranked 2011‚Äì12 Harvard Crimson on February 11, 2012 and the school's first win over a top-20 opponent since Henderson was a player on the 1995‚Äì96 Princeton team that upset the UCLA Bruins in the 1996 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament.

The vessel was considered to be one of the most powerful tugs of its time. Career Richard Holyoke was among the first seagoing tugs to be built on Puget Sound. The vessel was constructed by shipbuilders Hiram Doncaster and William McCurdy at Seabeck, Washington and was named after the manager of the Seabeck lumber mill. In 1891, Holyoke was owned by the Washington Mill Co., which joined with four other mills to form their own tug and towing company, called the Puget Sound Tug Boat Company. Each mill contributed one tug to the new company, and the Holyoke was the contribution of Washington Mill co. Holyoke, as the vessel was generally known, participated in numerous towing and salvage operations over the years. Some the more notable are described in this article.  Attempted salvage of Kilbrannan In early February 1896, Richard Holyoke was dispatched to Point Wilson, where the iron-hulled British sailing ship Kilbrannan had grounded. Despite the efforts of Holyoke and four other powerful seagoing tugs, Kilbrannan could not be pulled off the beach. Kilbrannan was not a total loss, as eventually a special channel was dredged and the vessel was floated free.Newell, ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History, at 9, 15, 27, 50, 100, 135, 144, 145, 191, 240, 263, 342, 353, 376, 392, 408, 481, and 553. 1897 flotilla to Alaska  On July 30, 1897, in the company of the then very old side-wheeler Eliza Anderson, the Richard Holyoke began towing several vessels from Seattle to St. Michael, Alaska to participate in the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898. The tows included the sternwheeler W.K. Merwin, the former Russian sidewheel gunboat Politkofsky stripped and converted to a fuel barge, and the small schooner William J. Bryant. After a number of misadventures, including the near-loss of the Merwin when the towing cable parted in a storm, the flotilla was eventually able to reach Nome, where the Politkovsky ended up abandoned on the beach. Both Richard Holyoke and William J. Bryant were able to make it back to Puget Sound, where the Bryant was later converted into the steamer Dode. Moran sternwheelers to Alaska In the spring of 1898, Richard Holyoke was engaged, together with two other seagoing tugs, to tow to Alaska, to the mouth of the Yukon River, 12 identical sternwheel steamboats which had recently been completed by the Moran Brothers shipyard in Seattle. After a difficult voyage, the tugs were able to get 11 of the sternwheelers in tow to St. Michael, where one was wrecked shortly after arrival.  The Clallam disaster In January 1904, Richard Holyoke, then under the ownership of the Puget Sound Tug Boat Company and another steam tug were dispatched to the rescue of the steamship Clallam, which in bad weather had begun taking on water near the end of its run to Victoria. At about 3:30 pm on January 8, Clallam's master, believing the vessel to be in immediate danger of sinking, had attempted to launch three lifeboats mostly occupied by women and children. However, when the boats were lowered into the water, they either overturned in the waves or were battered into the ship's sides, and 54 people were killed. Those remaining on board began bailing out the ship with buckets, and Clallam stayed afloat until the next morning, Saturday, January 9. Meanwhile, at about 10:35 p.m. on January 8, Holyoke, under the command of Capt. Robert Hall, found Clallam, a task made more difficult by the absence of any distress rockets on board the sinking steamer.. Captain Hall got a tow line over and took Clallam under tow. This was in between Smith Island and San Juan Island. Although Victoria was closer, the weather conditions were such that it seemed best to head for the American shore. The tug Sea Lion joined them at about 1:00 a.m. on January 9. Clallam never got to the shore. Captain Roberts realized she was about to founder and signaled the Holyoke to cast off the towline. Holyoke misunderstood Captain Roberts‚Äô signal to cast off the tow line, so it had to be cut lest the sinking Clallam drag Holyoke down with her.Newell, Ships of the Inland Sea. Clallam rolled over and sank quickly at about 1:15 a.m. The tugs then went to rescue the people in the water, saving most or all of the 36 who had remained aboard.Newell, Gordon R., and Williamson, Joe, Pacific Steamboats, at 84‚Äì85, Bonanza Books, New York, NY 1958 Capt. Edward D. Hickman (1876‚Äì1928), then serving as mate on Richard Holyoke, dove into the icy water to rescue 15 people. He suffered from poor health as a result for a long time afterwards. Later history In 1916 the Holyoke was sold to the Port Blakely Mill Company to be used for ship construction then being engaged in at Port Blakely by the Skinner and Eddy Corporation. In 1923 Skinner and Eddy sold Holyoke to the Bellingham Tug and Barge Company to be used to tow loads from Puget Sound to Alaska. In 1924 the vessel was equipped with wireless. In 1930 or 1931, the vessel was taken out of service. In 1940 Bellingham Tug and Barge Company sold the vessel to the Metal Conservation Corporation, a Seattle firm. The plan was to install a diesel engine in the hull and relocate the upper works to make room for materials to be salvaged from wrecks in Alaska waters. This never came through, and the hull was abandoned in Lake Union.

The Alliance was founded in 1993 following the merger of the International Exchange Association and the Liaison Group for International Educational Exchange. Following this merger, the Alliance became the sole collective voice of the 76 non-governmental organization exchange programs for the purpose of developing a unified public policy voice.  Guiding principles  The Alliance's stated mission is \\"to formulate and promote public policies that support the growth and well being of international exchange links between the people of the United States and other nations\\". The Alliance operates under five guiding principles: * The experience and relationships gained through international exchange are essential to furthering global peace, freedom, mutual understanding, international cooperation, economic prosperity, and the growth of human knowledge; * International exchange enhances the effectiveness of the United States in dealing with other nations by building the global competencies of U.S. citizens and others skills increasingly important in the world of the 21st century; * Participating in an international exchange program contributes fundamentally to a person's intellectual development; * The conduct of the international exchange program must embody the highest standards of quality, integrity, and professionalism, and must offer the fullest possible equality of opportunity; and * The international exchange community in the United States has a responsibility to advocate public policies needed to sustain and strengthen international linkages with other countries through educational and cultural exchanges. The Alliance produces specific recommendations for public policy makers concerning the exchange organizations that it represents. Further, it provides an opportunity for the leaders of the various exchange organizations to come together and exchange ideas or concerns. One of the core organizational activities of the Alliance is the spreading of public awareness of the role of exchange programs in meeting real demands.  View on exchange programs  The Alliance has four stated views on the role that exchange programs play in international relations. First, the Alliance believes that participants who engage in exchange programs and those who encounter exchange program participants experience a change in understanding of other cultures. Secondly, these types of exchanges allow for participants and others to grow and to develop new or refined skills. The third role is economic as people brought to the United States necessarily expend money and benefit local economies. The final role that the Alliance states is integral to exchange programs is in leadership training. The Alliance believes that exchange programs advance leadership skills that may be used in the future in finding solutions to the critical problems facing the United States, domestically and internationally.

December 15, 1885 in Heidelberg) was a German music scholar and writer best known for discovering and publishing Beethoven's famous bagatelle, \\"F√ºr Elise\\". Life After graduation from the Gymnasium in Duisburg, Nohl studied jurisprudence at the universities in Bonn, Heidelberg, and Berlin, where he received instruction in music from Siegfried Dehn and Friedrich Kiel. From 1853 to 1856 he was a referendary and undertook journeys to France and Italy, and he also taught music in Heidelberg. In 1860 he wrote his thesis on Mozart and earned the rank of privatdozent for \\"History and Aesthetic of Musical Art.\\" In 1864 he moved to Munich and made an introduction to Richard Wagner, whose works he had praised in his writings. In 1865 he was awarded by King Ludwig II the title of Professor of Music at the University of Munich for his compilation of Mozart's letters. The university faculty, however, was disinclined to Nohl, and he was not given any teaching duties. In that year he discovered through the \\"industrial teacher\\" Babeth Bredl in Munich the now-lost autograph of Beethoven's Bagatelle F√ºr Elise. The work was first published in 1867 in Nohl's book \\"New Beethoven Letters\\" (Neue Briefe Beethovens). From 1868 to 1872 he lived in Badenweiler and eventually returned to Heidelberg. In 1875, he was a Dozent at the polytechnic in Karlsruhe (predecessor to the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) and became a full professor in 1880. He was one of the most widely read writers on music of his time. His many books went through a lot of printings. His main legacy is as a Beethoven scholar, and a portion of his writings are housed at the state archive in Iserlohn.

Brymo released his fifth studio album Klƒ≠t√¥rƒ≠s on 9 May 2016. It comprises 11 tracks and was preceded by the lead single \\"Happy Memories\\". In March 2018, Brymo released his critically acclaimed sixth studio album O·π£√≥. Six months later, he released the self-referential fictional novel Oriri's Plight. Brymo teamed up with three members of Skata Vibration to form A.A.A, an alternative rock band whose eponymous debut EP was released in August 2019. Brymo's seventh studio album Yellow was released on 1 April 2020. Early life and career beginnings Olawale Ashimi was born and raised in Okokomaiko, Ojo, Lagos State; his father is an Awori carpenter and his mother is an Egun petty trader; he is the only child of his parents. Brymo grew up in a multi-faith household and learned to recite the entire Qur'an after being enrolled into an Islamic School. He went to Aganju Aka Primary School and later enrolled at Japual Primary School. Brymo was quite a troublesome child who got into numerous fights with other children from his neighbourhood. He was initially interested in playing football after graduating from secondary school. In 1999, he recorded his first song while in secondary school and titled it \\"Future\\". In 2002, Brymo and some of his friends formed a group called The Aliens. Between 2004 and 2005, the group had problems and disbanded in 2005. Brymo was inspired to create music after listening to his mother singing fuji songs. Brymo gained admission to Lagos State University (LASU), where he studied zoology, but after his second year he left LASU to pursue a career in music. 2007‚Äì2012: Brymstone, \\"Oleku\\" collaboration, and The Son of a Kapenta  Brymo released his debut studio album Brymstone in 2007. Its lead single \\"Shawty\\" was accompanied by a music video. He told Damiete Braide of The Sun he chose R&B; after being influenced by the work of R. Kelly and the Backstreet Boys. He also told Braide he sold more than 2,000 copies of the album within six months of its release. In a 2013 interview with The Sun, Brymo said management problems prevented him from getting a marketing deal for the album and that he had a one-million naira offer that did not work out because of technical issues. Brymo also said Brymstone is his worst body of work but credits it with helping him get a foot in the music business. Brymo was featured on the hit single \\"Oleku\\", which was released as the lead single from Ice Prince's debut studio album Everybody Loves Ice Prince (2011). Brymo told Tony Erhariefe of The Sun that his inspiration for recording the hook of \\"Oleku\\" came from the passion and energy around him, and from hunger and desperation. He also said that although the song did not necessarily generate money, it gave him exposure. In 2010, Denrele Edun, whom he met few years earlier, asked Brymo if he knew the rapper M.I, who was interested in talking with him. In 2010, Brymo signed to the label Chocolate City after talking with M.I. Prior to his record deal with Chocolate City, he collaborated with Jesse Jagz on the song \\"Love You\\", which appeared on the rapper's debut studio album Jag of All Tradez (2011). Brymo released his second studio album The Son of a Kapenta on 15 November 2012. It features guest appearances from Jesse Jagz, Pryse, M.I, Ice Prince and Efya. The album was recorded in English and Yoruba. On 18 September 2011, Brymo released the Legendury Beatz-produced \\"Ara\\" as the album's lead single. Its music video was directed by Aje Filmworks and was released on 31 December 2011. Brymo told Damiete Braide of The Sun that \\"Ara\\" is a slang term that loosely translates to \\"wonder\\". In a July 2012 interview with Adeola Adeyemo of BellaNaija, Brymo said he recorded the song while being under pressure from Chocolate City to submit a single. He also revealed that \\"Ara\\" was written six months after he recorded \\"Good Morning\\". On 16 April 2012, Brymo released \\"Good Morning\\" as the album's second single. Its music video was directed by Aje Filmworks and released on 30 July 2012. In a 2012 interview with The Punch newspaper, Brymo said his father's carpentry profession inspired the album's title and described The Son of a Kapenta as a summary of his life and said each song is a reflection of his energy. Brymo also said he recorded the album to be identified by his body of work as a lead artist rather than as a featured artist. In January 2013, The Nation newspaper included The Son of a Kapenta on its list of the \\"Albums that failed commercially in 2012\\". 2013‚Äì2015: Merchants, Dealers & Slaves, Tabula Rasa and Trance Brymo released his third studio album Merchants, Dealers & Slaves on 20 October 2013. The album was produced by Mikky Me and features guitar work from David. Hard copies of the album were released on 26 March 2014. On 18 October 2013, Brymo revealed the track list of the album on Instagram. The album's lead single \\"Down\\" was officially released on 1 October 2013; its music video was uploaded to YouTube the previous day. Brymo dedicated the song to his family and country. In May 2014, Nigerian Entertainment Today reported that undergraduate students at Southern Illinois University Carbondale deconstructed the lyrics of \\"Down\\" as part of a case study project. Brymo was invited to the school to attend the case study presentation. On 21 October 2013, \\"Eko\\" was released as the album's second single. Critical reception to Merchants, Dealers & Slaves was positive. Ayomide Tayo of Nigeria Entertainment Today described the album as a \\"soulful masterpiece that is emotionally charged with amazing production\\". On 14 October 2014, Brymo was announced as an ambassador for the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He released his fourth studio album Tabula Rasa on 30 October 2014; his manager Lanre Lawal announced plans for the release during an interview with The Punch in October 2014. Lawal also told The Sun the album would be a fusion of African folk and popular music. Brymo told The Nation newspaper he recorded the album to move on from his controversial split with Chocolate City. Brymo decided to name the album Tabula Rasa after hearing the judge used it in a speech. \\"Fe Mi\\" was released as the album's lead single on 18 September 2014. Ayo Onikoyi of Vanguard describes the song as \\"a soft traditional ballad\\". On 6 March 2015, Brymo released a documentary about the song \\"1 Pound\\", which was directed by St. Immaculate; a teaser of the documentary was released four days prior. On 30 March 2015, he released the music video for the song \\"Jƒô L√© O Sinmi\\"; the video was directed by Godson KC Uma of MaadKreativity Inc and runs for 3 minutes and 59 seconds. On 8 December 2015, Brymo released an eight- track compilation album titled Trance. It was released by American record label and publishing firm Tate Music Group and was originally scheduled for a September 2015 release. It was primarily targeted at audiences in the U.S., and contains songs from the albums Merchants, Dealers & Slaves and Tabula Rasa. Brymo described the album as a medley of thoughts based on his experiences. The album contains elements of African folk, soul, pop, and afrobeat. Chocolate City departure In May 2013, Brymo announced on Twitter that he had left Chocolate City. Audu Maikori, who was the CEO of Chocolate City at the time, refuted Brymo's claims during a press conference at the label's office in Lekki. Maikori said Brymo still had three years left on his contract and still needed to record two albums. Vanguard newspaper reported that during the press conference, Maikori said Brymo committed an act of insubordination when he refused to remove an inappropriate picture he posted on Instagram. While speaking to journalists in June 2013, Brymo said Chocolate City cheated him when the label failed to explain how his second studio album was leaked. He also said there was no accountability about the way his album was being sold and distributed. In August 2013, Brymo signed a distribution deal with Spinlet, enabling the digital media company to distribute his next album online. Nigerian Entertainment Today reported that Spinlet discontinued the deal after Chocolate City made them aware of its existing contract with Brymo. On 14 October 2013, Chocolate City filed an interim injunction against Brymo, restraining him from partaking in musical ventures beyond the confines of his contract. Six days later, Brymo released his third studio album despite reports about the injunction. On 21 October, a judge at the Federal High Court of Lagos restrained Brymo from releasing and distributing any musical work pending Chocolate City's lawsuit against him. According to The Nation newspaper, Brymo and his management met with Chocolate City representatives in October 2013 to discuss mutually-agreeable terms. Chocolate City asked Brymo to sign an agreement during the meeting, but failed. On 11 November 2013, Premium Times newspaper reported that the legal teams of both parties met in court for a hearing and that the case was adjourned to 5 December 2013. Between December 2013 and March 2014, the case was adjourned four times for several reasons. In March 2014, the Federal High Court of Lagos lifted the restraint it put on Brymo. In May 2014, Nigerian Entertainment Today reported that the judge presiding over the case pulled out after he was accused of being biased. In a radio interview with Toolz in May 2016, Brymo said he did not win the case against Chocolate City, saying, \\"we had the opportunity to iron it out in court but they fried it up. I don‚Äôt know what they did but they definitely spoke to the judge and spoke to the lawyers and scrapped the case, they are lawyers; they can do it.\\" 2016‚Äì2017: Klƒ≠t√¥rƒ≠s Brymo's fifth studio album Klƒ≠t√¥rƒ≠s was released on 9 May 2016. It was made available for pre-order via iTunes prior to its release. The album comprises 11 tracks and was preceded by the lead single \\"Happy Memories\\". Brymo's girlfriend Esse Kakada is featured on the song \\"Naked\\". The original artwork for the album was designed by Georgi Georgiev of Moonring Art Design. An edited version of the artwork was done by Duks after iTunes refused to put up the original artwork. In an interview with Nigerian Entertainment Today, Brymo said the title of the album means key in the Greek language and that the album is an expression of love and the uncertainty of it. He said, \\"the album is the key to a certain door I have knocked on for years; and yes it was meant to be sensual, there ought to be two sides to the coin\\".  2018: O·π£√≥ and Oriri's Plight  alt=A man is seated playing the piano and singing into a mic. In November 2017, Brymo said on Twitter that plans were underway for his sixth studio album, whose title he disclosed as O·π£√≥ (Yoruba: The Wizard) and launched a website titled theosoproject.com dedicated to the project. In August 2017, he released the Jazz-infused Afrobeat single \\"Do You Know Me\\". O·π£√≥ was released on 27 March 2018; it consists of 11 tracks. It was produced and mixed by Brymo's frequent collaborator Mikky Me Joses. The album was mastered at Metalworks Studios in Canada. A day following the release of the album, Brymo released the music video for the lead single \\"Heya\\", which was filmed and directed by NVMB3R Production. The video features Brymo exposing his buttocks while wearing a loincloth to hide his genitals. The video received mixed reviews; in an e-mail to Pulse Nigeria, Brymo defended his decision to expose his buttocks, saying, \\"I decided to appear how my forebears dressed before the arrival of civilization to Nubian continent\\". In September 2018, Brymo released Oriri's Plight, a self-referential fictional novel. It is centered around a young Nubian man of the Dark Ages. The digital version of the book was published worldwide on all digital book platforms, while the physical version was published in Nigeria on 4 October 2018. The book was published and distributed by Clockwyce Publishing. 2019‚Äìpresent: A.A.A, Yellow and Verses Brymo teamed up with three members of Skata Vibration to form A.A.A, an alternative rock band composed of himself, guitarist Jad Moukarim, drummer Adey Omotade, and bassist Laughter. The band's eponymous debut EP was released on 5 August 2019. Comprising five tracks, it is a fusion of African folk and psychedelic rock. The EP was recorded at Blackstar Studios in Ikoyi, Lagos, and was mixed and mastered by Mikky Me Joses. Music critic Kolawole Michael said A.A.A is a \\"decent experimental piece, a litmus test that foretells what Brymo‚Äôs next project may sound like. It's a show of Brymo tenacity, a testament to his songwriting skill and vocal phrasing\\". Brymo's seventh studio album Yellow was released on 1 April 2020. The album's cover art and track list were unveiled in March 2020. Brymo described Yellow as an album about \\"love and survival\\" and said it would be an alternative pop and electronic record. Yellow incorporates elements of sentimental ballad, trap, sophisti- pop, shoegaze, rock, synth-pop and folk. The album's cover art features a rendition of Insight and Frustrations 2020, a painting by Nigerian artist Samuel Olowomeye Ancestor. Brymo revealed on Instagram that he was drawn to the painting after having several conversations with his friends. Nigerian singer Lindsey Abudei is the only artist featured on the album. With the exception of \\"Ab·ª• Ya\\", which was co-produced by Nsikak David and Lindsey Abudei, Yellow was produced and engineered entirely by Brymo's frequent collaborator Mikky Me Joses. Thematically, the album explores topics such as love, heartbreak, socio-politics and mental health. Yellow spans three sides and was initially composed of 17 tracks: six were recorded in English, five in Nigerian Pidgin, five in Yoruba and one in Igbo. The album's three sides were numbered in Arabic, Roman and English numerals, respectively. On 24 March, Brymo cited technical reasons for omitting the tracks \\"Iya Awele\\" and \\"Ife\\" from the album. In April 2020, Brymo released the e-book Versus, alternatively titled Verses (Musings, Notes and Prose). Artistry Brymo's music is a mixture of fuji, R&B;, pop and rock. He told Damiete Braide his music can easily be called pop due to its ability of getting across to the people. Brymo's albums Merchants, Dealers & Slaves and Tabula Rasa comment on social injustice and chaos that are prevalent in Nigerian society. In a 2016 interview with OkayAfrica, Brymo said, \\"Although my songs reflect many issues which are relevant in my society, I believe that human relations is the site where all issues emerge\\". Music critic Michael Kolawole said Brymo's music has doses of \\"profanity couched in intellectualism and philosophical thoughts\\". Michael also characterized Brymo's music as \\"affirmations of deep-rooted personal ideology, enigmatic and beautiful lyrical poetry, equations of balanced ribaldry and cheekiness\\". Personal life Brymo has a son who was born on 27 March 2015. On 12 November 2015, he uploaded pictures of his son onto his Instagram account for the first time.

This crisis was started by a group of politicians who were dissatisfied towards Stephen Kalong Ningkan's leadership as chief minister. Ningkan was later removed from the chief minister post by the Governor of Sarawak in June 1966. However, Ningkan was reinstated by the High Court in early September 1966. He was ousted from the chief minister office for the final time at the end of September 1966 and was replaced by Tawi Sli as the new chief minister. It was widely believed that the ouster of Ningkan was a result of interference by the Malaysian federal government due to him being a strong advocate of greater state autonomy. Background Stephen Kalong Ningkan was the leader of the Sarawak Alliance which comprised Sarawak National Party (SNAP), Parti Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA), Barisan Ra'ayat Jati Sarawak (BARJASA), and Sarawak Chinese Association (SCA). On 22 July 1963, Ningkan was appointed as the first chief minister of Sarawak following his party landslide winnings of the 1963 Sarawak district council elections. Temenggung Jugah (leader of the PESAKA party) was originally poised to become the first governor of Sarawak however he was transferred to a newly created portfolio called \\"Federal Minister of Sarawak Affairs\\" because of the opposition from the Malaysian federal government against the Dayaks to fill up the two highest posts in the state. Ningkan did not include any of the PESAKA representatives in his state cabinet despite the party contributing a significant number of seats for the Alliance. Ningkan did not have a good relationship with the federal government and also with his component parties such as PESAKA and BARJASA. He excluded both PESAKA and BARJASA from the cabinet decision-making process and opposed the usage of Malay language as the official language in Sarawak. Ningkan was also slow in replacing the expatriate officers from the state civil service to enable the Borneotisation of the state civil service. Ningkan opined that expatriates should hold the office until the locals were suitable to take over the positions. In the next three years, the Malays of PANAS and BARJASA were working together trying to topple Ningkan from power. They tried to bring the peninsular-based United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) into Sarawak to consolidate their power against Ningkan. However, after an assessment by the peninsular UMNO, the plan was cancelled because the party would require the support of other non-muslim Dayaks in order to survive in Sarawak as the group made up 50% of the total Sarawak population. In 1965, Ningkan tried to initiate a land reform law that would allow the natives to sell their land to anyone including the Chinese. Such a law would also allow the natives to acquire large tracts of forest land. Ningkan's action angered the leaders in BARJASA party. Subsequently, Sarawak Native Alliance consisting of Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS), BARJASA party, and Parti Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA) was formed in order to challenge Ningkan's leadership.Syam, M.F (2012). In Domination and Contestation: Muslim Bumiputera Politics in Sarawak. Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. p. 109-110. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 23 June 2014. The land bill was subsequently withdrawn and PESAKA reaffirmed its standing with SNAP while accused BARJASA for splitting Iban's unity amongst SNAP and PESAKA. Ningkan then expelled BARJASA from the Alliance. However, negotiations restarted between the Alliance and BARJASA. BARJASA and PANAS were later readmitted into the Alliance. Two ministerial posts were reinstated for BARJASA, two new ministerial posts were created for PESAKA and one ministerial post was created for PANAS. On 13 June 1966, Ningkan sacked Abdul Taib Mahmud (a BARJASA leader) from the post of Minister of Communication and Works for the second time. Ningkan accused Taib for trying to topple the state government. On the following day, PESAKA and BARJASA ministers resigned voluntarily from the state cabinet. The political crisis On 16 June 1966, 21 out of 42 members of the state legislature declared that they did not have confidence in Stephen Kalong Ningkan. The 21 assemblymen wrote a petition to the Governor of Sarawak stating that they have lost confidence in the chief minister. The prime minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman also advocated the petition and asked Ningkan to resign. On the same day, the Governor, Abang Haji Openg, at the insistence of the federal government in Kuala Lumpur, requested Ningkan to resign from the post. However, Ningkan refused to resign from the cabinet. Ningkan argued that the letter has not been supported by a formal motion of no confidence against him at the Council Negri (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly). He also demanded the names of all the 21 Council Negri members who signed the petition. Ningkan also claimed that he still commanded a majority of the state assembly members and challenged his dissidents into a formal debate of motion of no confidence in the Council Negeri. Since Ningkan refused to resign, the governor then declared that Ningkan has ceased to hold office and appointed Tawi Sli as the new chief minister. The Governor also forwarded the names who had signed the petition to Ningkan. Judicial intervention in the political dispute Following the ouster, Ningkan decided bring the case into Kuching High Court and named the Governor as the first defendant and Tawi Sli as the second defendant. On 7 September 1966, Chief Justice of Borneo, Justice Harley, delivered a verdict that reinstated Ningkan back to his chief minister post. According to Section 21 of the Interpretation Ordinance of the Sarawak state constitution, only the Council Negri has the power to appoint or dismiss a chief minister. The Governor does not have the power to dismiss a chief minister. However, chief minister can only be dismissed if he had lost the confidence of Council Negri or he refused to resign from the chief minister post but he also failed to advise a dissolution of the Council Negri. The removal of Ningkan Following the court's decision, Ningkan tried to initiate a dissolution of Council Negri so that he could seek a fresh mandate from the voters. However, in September 1966, the federal government declared a state of emergency in Sarawak, citing chaos in the state. Through the Emergency (Federal Constitution and the Constitution of Sarawak) Act, an amendment was made to Article 150 of the Sarawak constitution. Such amendment authorised the Governor of Sarawak to convene a Council Negri meeting without going through the chief minister.Sundaram J.K., Wong S.N (2008). In Law, Institutions and Malaysian Economic Development. NUS Press. p. 57. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 3 February 2015. A Council Negri meeting was commenced on 23 September 1966 and Ningkan was successfully removed from the chief minister post. Aftermath Ningkan decided to bring the case to Federal Court of Malaysia after his second ouster. Ningkan also tried to seek legal advice from the British government about Britain's role in setting the conditions of Sarawak entering Malaysia and the signing of the London's agreement on behalf of Sarawak. Ningkan also argued that the Sarawak constitutional amendment was illegal because the state of emergency was declared under unusual circumstances. There was no riots or disturbances taking place in Sarawak. Furthermore, Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation was already over in August 1966. However, the federal court held that the word \\"emergency\\" has a broad meaning and it would also include the Sarawak constitutional crisis because such a crisis would cause a breakdown in the Sarawak state government and harm the political stability in Sarawak. Therefore, such declaration of emergency in Sarawak is legal. On 1 August 1968, Judicial Committee of the Privy Council dismissed Ningkan's appeal. MacDermott stated that, \\"their Lordships could not find any reason for saying that the emergency was not grave and did not threaten the security of Sarawak.\\" References S S Category:History of Sarawak Category:Politics of Sarawak Category:Constitutional crises ","title":"1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis"},{"id":"31608054","text":", also styled as PERSONZ, is a Japanese pop and rock band formed in 1983 with the lead vocalist Jill, Tsukasa Tanaka, Mitsugu Watanabe, and Tsutomu Fujita.

There is so much in it! Sadly though, I think it may be largely overlooked by the music press as a) it's an underground release; and b) it doesn't fit neatly into any established genres.

Flore des Serres et des Jardins de l'Europe ('Flowers of the Greenhouses and Gardens of Europe') (18451888) was one of the finest horticulture journals produced in Europe during the 19th century, spanning 23 volumes and over 2000 coloured plates with French, German and English text. Founded by Louis van Houtte and edited together with Charles Antoine Lemaire and Michael Joseph Fran√ßois Scheidweiler, it was a showcase for lavish hand-finished engravings and lithographs depicting and describing botanical curiosities and treasures from around the world. The work is remarkable for the level of colour-printing craftmanship displayed by the Belgian lithographers Severeyns, Stroobant, and De Pannemaker. Louis-Constantin Stroobant (1814-1872), printed many of the illustrations for the first 10 volumes.Welcome to the website of Antiquariaat Junk Most of the plants depicted in Flore des Serres were available for sale in van Houtte's nursery, so that in a sense the journal doubled as a catalogue. The editors were experienced botanical engravers and horticulturists, combining their knowledge and skills to create a showpiece of novel exotics and familiar cultivated plants. Lemaire came from being an engraver for Redoute's great works Les Liliaces and Les Roses. Van Houtte, owner of the most successful nursery in Europe at that time, sent his own plant explorers to find unknown orchids and other exotics and bring them back to Ghent for cultivation at his nursery and later publication in Flore des Serres.

The defensive wall was built by the Nguyen Dynasty as a demarcation line against the ƒê√° V√°ch (H're people). It is the longest monument in Southeast Asia. History and purpose According to ƒê·∫°i Nam th·ª±c l·ª•c () and other archives from the reign of Emperor ƒê·ªìng Kh√°nh, the wall was constructed in 1819 by L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát, a high-ranking mandarin, under Emperor Gia Long early in the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty. The wall is considered the \\"greatest engineering feat\\" of the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty. Nguyen Tien Dong contended that the wall was constructed over 500 years ago and was adopted for military purposes during the 19th century. Nguyen Dang Vu, director of the Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i, said that parts of the wall in mountainous regions existed hundreds of years ago. It was possibly constructed by General Bui Ta Han (1496‚Äì1568) when he became the leader of Qu·∫£ng Nam. Archaeologists have excavated ceramic relics that verify the 16th-century origin. In 2005, Andrew Hardy, head of the Hanoi headquarters of √âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient, came upon a textual reference to a \\"Long Wall of Quang Ngai\\" in the \\"Descriptive Geography of the Emperor Dong Khanh\\", an 1885 Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty court document. An excavation crew was assembled; led by Hardy and archaeologist Nguyen Tien Dong of the Institute of Archaeology at the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences, the team discovered the wall after five years of searching. In 2009, they had uncovered the first portion of the wall in Nghƒ©a H√†nh District. The wall has since been a destination of some independent explorers. Experts posit that the construction of the wall was the result of the work of Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty soldiers and collaboration between the Viet and the H're minority, who seldom had peaceful relations. Residents of either side of the wall relate that the wall was erected by their forebears to prevent invasions by the opposing side. Not only did it define the territorial borders of the respective peoples, it also afforded security and furthered trade. Similar rock arrangement methods have been found on L√Ω S∆°n Island. One-hundred fifteen forts are located where rivers intersect the wall, with posts for 15 to 20 guards each. In these secured settings, the Viet and the H're conducted trade, the H're trading rice, cinnamon, and forest products for salt from the Viet. During the Vietnam War, armaments and food were conveyed from north to south Vietnam via portions of the wall in ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï and Ho√†i √Çn districts, as extensions of the Ho Chi Minh trail. Description Running parallel to the Truong Son mountain range, the wall extends through ten districts‚ÄîTr√† B·ªìng, S∆°n T·ªãnh, S∆°n H√†, T∆∞ Nghƒ©a, Minh Long, Nghƒ©a H√†nh, Ba T∆°, ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï, Ho√†i √Çn, and An L√£o. Alternating chunks of soil and rock were used to build the wall, reaching in height at its maximum and in width. In more rugged terrain, the wall was built primarily of rocks to prevent landslides and provide stability in inclement weather. The wall is similar to Hadrian's Wall in that it is parallel to an antiquated trade route. Researchers have unearthed markets, temples, and the aforementioned forts along the road, all built long before the wall. Some natives dub it the \\"Great Wall of Vietnam\\". The wall runs along the \\"ƒê∆∞·ªùng c√°i quan th∆∞·ª£ng\\" () as it safeguards the National Route connecting the north and south Vietnam regions. Research Christopher Young of English Heritage said, \\"The Long Wall presents an enormous opportunity for research, careful conservation and sustainable use\\". At a 27 March conference at the site of the wall, EU ambassadors deemed the wall a \\"unique architectural monument not only of Vietnam but also of the world\\". Hardy asserted that the wall \\"is the evidence of goods transaction between the people in the lowland and upperland\\". French Ambassador to Vietnam Jean-Fran√ßois Girault said, \\"In the world, there are walls to separate communities but the Truong Luy Wall in Quang Ngai gives us a new look about the mutual-assistance of difference communities\\". Tourism and preservation On 9 March 2011, the Vietnam government formally established the wall as a National Heritage site, planning to request the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage designation and to make the wall a global tourist site. In view of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i's history, developing the wall for tourism would be difficult, CNN's Adam Bray noted. Tourism in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i has been considerably limited by the government. Establishing the wall as a tourist destination would call for government encouragement of \\"adventure trekking and cycling through previously isolated highland communities on an unprecedented scale\\", introducing historical ecotourism. The government plans to build a \\"protected corridor stretching 500m on either side of the wall\\", and the People's Committee of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i has devoted VND15 billion to rejuvenating and maintaining the wall. Nguyen Giang Hai of the Vietnam Institute of Archaeology asserted that since the preservation of the relic is contingent on indigenous sentiment, \\"there is a need to sow the seed of consciousness for protecting the relic in the community living alongside the structure.\\" Young articulated that in the case of tourism, \\"income-generation opportunities\\" should be available for locals, since \\"a world heritage is not something to admire but [something] for the benefit of the people\\". Between 27 April and 8 May, English and French advisers will examine the wall and discuss with Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i officials how to publicise the wall in light of socioeconomic expansion.

It is located in the town of Molde. It is the church for the Molde parish as well as the seat of the Molde domprosti (arch-deanery) and the episcopal seat of the Diocese of M√∏re. The white, brick church was built in a long church style in 1957 by the architect Finn Bryn. The church seats about 700 people. This building was built to replace an earlier church here, and it is the third church to be located on the same site. It became a cathedral in 1983 when the Diocese of M√∏re was created. Structure The cathedral is a double-nave basilica that has a free-standing bell tower next to the main building. The cathedral seats about 1000 people. The church building is shaped like a long \\"basilica\\", but with a central aisle and another on the north side, but not on the south side. The entrance consists of two copper-clad doors surrounded by fields in natural concrete under a gable roof. The square campanile (bell tower) is at the church's southwest corner, and it is approximately tall. Behind the church's main entry doors to the west, there is a spacious rectangular foyer which leads into the sanctuary. History This is the third church to stand in the town of Molde. The first, cruciform in plan, was built in approximately 1661. When it burned down, a wooden neo-Gothic dragestil church was built to replace it in 1887. This wooden church burned down during the bombing of the town center on 29 April 1940 (during World War II). After the war was over, planning for a new church began, to designs by architect Finn Bryn (1890-1975), who was awarded the contract after winning a competition for a new church in Molde in 1948. Total costs came in about . The church was completed and consecrated on 8 December 1957. Bishops The cathedral has been the seat of the Bishop of the Diocese of M√∏re since its establishment in 1983.

Jose Luis Ansorena, within the Andra Mari Choir, the organizer of Musikaste since 1973, took the initiative to create a center to collect the works that could be spread by this festival. The collection of scores of Basque-navarre composers throughout the time began in 1974. Nowadays, it contains over 200,000 documents, 93,997 of which are audiovisual documents and 74,441 are sheets. Other 16,810 documents complete the collection, including books, magazines and microforms, and also 15,669 copies of varied documentation, such as letters, photographs, programs and posters. The archive consists of different sections: * Basque composers: at the beginning, the score collection of Basque‚Äìnavarre composers was carried out through queries in libraries and archives, purchase and collaboration with creatives. Since 2000, a score legal deposit copy is collected from the Basque Country Autonomous Community. * Archives collections: documentary collections, archives and individual libraries, as well as institutional collections, began to arrive in 1978, either in terms of donation or as assignment on depot. * Sound archives: this section stores the sound records of the works created by Basque composers. At present, the initial scope has been enlarged to include the entire musical production which is edited in the Basque Country, as well as the one concerning Basque musicians. Since 2000 a sound recording legal deposit copy is collected from the Basque Country Autonomous Community. * Musical library: this section compiles the main printed sources for the musical research development, with an important presence of reference works.

On 6 April 2011, he was found dead in an open air badminton court on the first floor of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) building in Kuala Lumpur. His death coincided with the MACC's investigation into allegations of corruption in the Royal Malaysian Customs. The MACC insists that Ahmad Sarbani was not murdered, nor did he commit suicide, but rather fell to his death trying to escape from the building. In September 2011, the coroner's court ruled the death an accident. Ahmad Sarbani's death came nearly two years after the death of Teoh Beng Hock in the custody of the MACC. A royal commission of inquiry ruled Teoh's death as suicide resulting from abusive behaviour by MACC officers, a verdict which was rejected by the victim's family. Biography Ahmad Sarbani bin Mohamed was the Selangor Customs assistant director. He was attached to the Port Klang Customs office. At the time of his death, Ahmad Sarbani was 56 years old. He is survived by his parents, his wife, and five children. Events leading to death On 29 March 2011, the MACC announced that it had uncovered a syndicate involved in tax evasion, money laundering and illegal money outflows worth RM108 billion. That figure was later revised to RM2.2 billion. A special task force comprising the MACC, the Inland Revenue Board, the Customs Department and Bank Negara Malaysia raided over 100 premises, including 25 Royal Malaysian Customs offices, in what was known as \\"Operation 3B.\\" Ahmad Sarbani was among 62 customs officers who were detained relation to the investigation. He was first detained on 1 April 2011. He was then picked up again by the MACC for questioning on 4 April. During this round of questioning, he confessed to accepting between RM50 and RM100 a month from Schenker Logistics officer Wan Zainal Abidin Wan Zaki and between RM30 and RM200 a month from a Top Mark Freight & Shipping officer called Ah Seng. After giving his statement, Sarbani was released on bail. He returned to the MACC building on Jalan Cochrane, Kuala Lumpur at 8:26am on 6 April, apparently to change a statement he had previously given. The MACC maintains he had gone on his own accord without prior appointment. According to MACC accounts, Ahmad Sarbani was brought into a room on the third floor by an officer and disappeared a few minutes after 10:15am. He was then found dead in the open air badminton court on the first floor at 10:20am. Police classified the case as sudden death. Aftermath In a press conference after the news emerged, MACC director of investigations Mustafar Ali said Ahmad Sarbani went to the MACC building without prior appointment. Two MACC investigating officers who met Ahmad Sarbani were suspended on 8 April. The MACC also announced that all business with accused persons, suspects, witnesses and complainants would be conducted only on the ground floor with heightened supervision. None of the Customs officers initially held under the tax evasion and money laundering allegations has been charged. Ahmad Sarbani's family lawyers denied allegations that he was involved in money laundering and rejected suggestions that he committed suicide. Inquest On 2 June 2011, Attorney-General Abdul Gani Patail agreed to hold an inquest into Ahmad Sarbani's death. The inquest was held from 4 to 15 July 2011 at the magistrate's court in Kuala Lumpur and continued on 2 August. ;Family Sarbani's wife, Maziah, told the court that her husband was \\"very calm, patient and rational\\" and would \\"never\\" have committed suicide. ;Schenker Logistics Schenker Logistics senior executive Wan Zainal Abidin Wan Zaki denied that Sarbani ever took bribes from his company. Zainal Abidin said Sarbani called him at 8:55pm on 4 April to tell him that his name was mentioned by Sarbani when questioned by the MACC. He also told the court he felt Sarbani was being pressured. Zainal Abidin last spoke to Sarbani at 9:55pm on 5 April to ask how he was. ;Customs officers Customs officer Abdul Rahim Abdul Kadir, who among those arrested in the MACC crackdown on tax evasion and money laundering, told the court that he was beaten and forced to confess to accepting bribes by the MACC. He said he lodged a police report on the incident then retracted it out of fear. Another Customs officer, Mohd Khairul Hisyam Mohd Gazali, said Sarbani told him on 2 April that he was pressured by the MACC to confess that he had accepted bribes but refused to give in. Three of Sarbani's colleagues testified that Sarbani was calm and patient man with \\"high integrity.\\" ;MACC Investigating officer Abdul Ghani Ali testified that he was under orders from KL MACC investigation unit head Mohd Fauzi Husin not to allow Sarbani to change his statement on 6 April. He said he ordered Sarbani to wait in the MACC office before Sarbani was found dead. Ghani also said: \\"Throughout my career, I think no one has confessed like this before. I‚Äôve never met a suspect who confessed.\\" Assistant superintendent Mohd Rosly Mohd Saup testified that Sarbani denied accepting bribes from a Top Mark officer on 2 April. Assistant superintendent Sheikh Niza Khairy Sheikh Mohamad said Sarbani confessed to him on 4 April to receiving \\"goodwill payments\\" and that Sarbani went to the MACC office two days later to change his statement. ;Forensics DSP Sharul Othman Mansor from the Bukit Aman Forensic Division said Sarbani fell 10 m to his death. Forensic investigator DSP Sharul Othman Mansor told the court that Sarbani's death was neither suicide nor murder. He instead claimed that Sarbani tried to jump over the roof of the badminton court, but missed and fell to his death. Sharul added that there were no signs of a struggle and that an optical illusion made the roof appear near to the corner of the window. Forensic pathologist Faridah Mohd Noor, who performed the autopsy, said the death was \\"accidental\\" based on \\"the injuries and circumstantial evidence.\\" =Verdict= On 26 September 2011, the coroner's court ruled Sarbani's death an accident. Coroner Aizatul Akmal Maharani said the fear of being arrested must have preyed heavily on Ahmad Sarbani's mind so as to make him consider the window exit. Aizatul also remarked that the MACC officer tasked to look after Sarbani on 6 April had been \\"negligent.\\" Malaysia Today allegations Prominent blogger Raja Petra Kamaruddin alleged on his Malaysia Today blog that Sarbani fell accidentally from the third-floor pantry window of the MACC building after being forced onto the ledge by a senior MACC officer. He claimed the MACC then went through great lengths, including \\"concoct[ing] the most plausible story\\" and wiping CCTV footage, to cover up the incident. Raja Petra also posted what appeared to be Sarbani's cautioned statement denying that he had ever received \\"additional profit\\" as a Customs officer. Sarbani's family lawyer Awtar Singh said Raja Petra's allegations were \\"plausible [ada asasnya].\\" The MACC's lawyer called the allegations \\"nonsense.\\"  References  Mohamed Ahmad Sarbani Mohamed Ahmad Sarbani Category:Political scandals in Malaysia Category:Malaysian prisoners and detainees Category:Deaths in police custody in Malaysia ","title":"Death of Ahmad Sarbani Mohamed"},{"id":"31608415","text":"upright=1.2 Marie Cabel (31 January 1827 ‚Äì 23 May 1885) was a Belgian coloratura soprano. She is probably best remembered for having created the role of Philine in Ambroise Thomas's opera Mignon. Biography=Early life and career Born Marie-Jos√®phe DreuletteKutsch and Riemens 2003, p. 675, give her birth name as Marie-Jos√®phe Dreulette; Walsh 1981, p. 375, as Marie Josephe Dreulette; F√©tis 1878, p. 137, as Marie-Jos√®phe Dreullette. Amadeus Almanac (17 November 1866) lists her forenames as Marie-Jeanne-Jos√®phe. None of the other cited sources corroborate this. in Li√®ge, she was the daughter of a former cavalry officer in Napoleon's army, who after his discharge had become an accountant for various theatres in Belgium. Pauline Viardot, who at that time lived in a chateau near Brussels, happened to hear Cabel sing as a child and predicted a great future for her.F√©tis 1878, p. 137. Cabel first studied voice in Li√®ge with Bouillon,Chitty and Rosenthal 1992. and, her father having died, gave music lessons to help support her mother. Cabel's younger brother Edmond also became a singer and in 1863 created the role of Hylas in Hector Berlioz's Les Troyens.Walsh 1981, pp. 170, 317, 375. Cabel later studied voice in Brussels with Ferdinand Cabel and Louis-Joseph Cabel.Louis Joseph Cabel n√© Cabu (? ‚Äì 1884), a baritone, was a member of Adolphe Adam's Op√©ra-National at the Cirque Olympique in Paris in 1847‚Äì1848 (Walsh 1981, pp. 360, 375). He rejoined the revived company (renamed Th√©√¢tre Lyrique), in the fall of 1853, along with Marie Cabel, who was his sister-in- law (Walsh 1981, pp. 39, 43). In 1847 she married Georges Cabel, the brother of Louis-Joseph and also a voice teacher.Georges Cabel n√© Cabu (? ‚Äì 1881) (see Walsh 1981, pp. 43, 375). F√©tis 1878, p. 137, states that Cabel married her voice teacher Louis-Joseph Cabu dit Cabel. Walsh was aware of F√©tis's article (F√©tis's book is listed in his bibliography on p. 367) and repeats some portions of it. Nevertheless, F√©tis's information concerning the identity of Marie Cabel's husband is more or less replicated by Kuhn 1992, p. 114; Sadie 1992, vol. 1., p. 667; Chitty and Rosenthal 2001; and Kutsch and Riemens 2003, p. 675. As the marriage was unhappy, they soon separated and ultimately divorced. That same year she gave a concert in Paris and continued her studies at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1848‚Äì1849.Kutsch and Riemens 2003, p. 675. Cabel made her operatic debut in Paris at the Ch√¢teau des Fleurs in 1848, and in 1849 sang the roles of Georgette in Hal√©vy's Le val d'Andorre and Ath√©na√Øs in Hal√©vy's Les mousquetaires de la reine at the Op√©ra-Comique, where she went almost unnoticed.Kutsch and Riemens do not specify which opera Cabel performed in her 1848 debut at the Th√©√¢tre Chateau des Fleurs or whether it was a concert performance or a fully staged one. F√©tis 1878, p. 137, describes it somewhat differently: \\"En 1847, Mme Cabel vint √† Paris et se fit entendre au chateau des Fleurs, √©tablissement de concerts situ√© aux Champs-Elys√©es, puis elle obtint un engagement √† l'Op√©ra-Comique, o√π elle d√©buta au mois de mai 1849 dans la r√¥le de Georgette du Val d'Andorre, apr√®s quoi delle se montra dans les Mousquetaires de la Reine. Elle passa alors completement inaper√ßue‚Ä¶.\\" (\\"In 1847, Madame Cabel went to Paris and was heard at the Chateau des Fleurs, a concert establishment situated on the Champs-Elys√©es, then she obtained an engagement at the Op√©ra-Comique, where she debuted in the month of May 1849 in the role of Georgette of Le val d'Andorre, after which she appeared in Les mousquetaires de la reine. She passed then completely unnoticed‚Ä¶.\\"). Moving back to Brussels, she sang at the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie from 1850 to 1853 with greater success. In 1852 she also appeared in Lyon, at a salary of 3,000 francs per month, and the following year in Strasbourg and Geneva. At the Th√©√¢tre LyriqueJules Seveste= It was in Lyon that she was discovered by Jules Seveste, the director of the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique in Paris.Walsh 1981, p. 43. Seveste engaged her for the 1853‚Äì1854 season at his theatre, where she made her debut creating the role of Toinon in Adolphe Adam's Le bijou perdu on 6 October 1853. F√©tis described her as \\"young, fresh, winsome, cheerful, having the devil of a body, lacking at the time taste and musical style, but blessed with an adorable voice, of a marvelous purity, whose brilliant and silvery timbre produced an amazing effect on the public, with which she launched the most difficult lines with amazing confidence and assurance‚Ä¶\\"F√©tis 1878, p. 137. \\"Jeune, fra√Æche, accorte, souriante, ayant le diable au corps, manquant √† la fois de go√ªt et de style musical, mais dou√©e d'une voix adorable, d'une puret√© merveilleuse et dont le timbre brillant et argentin produisant un effet √©tonnant sur le public, avec cela lan√ßant les traits les plus difficiles avec une cr√¢nerie et une s√ªret√© surprenantes‚Ä¶\\" Georges Bousquet, writing in the Revue et Gazette Musicale of 9 October 1853, reported that the hit of the show was Cabel's performance of the aria \\"Ah! qu'il fait donc bon cueillir la fraise\\".Walsh 1981, p. 43. Walsh gives the first line of this aria as \\"Ah! qu'il fait donc beau cuellir des fraise\\"; the vocal score (p. 118 as reprinted by Alphonse Leduc) has \\"Ah! qu'il fait donc bon, qu'il fait donc bon cueillir la fraise\\". See File #71241 at IMSLP. She became such a popular star that the company, located in the working class district of the Boulevard du Temple, began to attract a well-heeled audience, including Emperor Napoleon III and his new bride Eug√©nie de Montijo. Cabel as Marie in Clapisson's La promise Cabel continued singing at the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique, creating the roles of Corbin in Fran√ßois-Auguste Gevaert's Georgette ou Le moulin de Fontneoy (28 November 1853) and Marie in Louis Clapisson's La promise (16 March 1854).Antoine Louis Clapisson (born Naples, 15 September 1810; died Paris 19 March 1866), French composer, curator, and teacher (Bran- Ricci and Lacombe 2001). The Musical World of 25 March 1854 suggested that \\"although not a work of the first class, it [La promise] will probably have a run, owing to the manner in which the principal part is sustained by Mlle Marie Cabel‚Ä¶.\\"Quoted by Walsh 1981, p. 47. This proved to be true, as it was performed a total of 60 times, that season and the next.Walsh 1981, p. 304. Near the end of the season in May, Cabel was on leave and appeared in Bordeaux and Nantes, but was announced, and may have returned, for a benefit performance of La promise at the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique on 1 June.Walsh 1981, p. 48. =London ‚Äì Summer of 1854= After the season in Paris was over, during the summer break, a contingent of the company led by Lafont went to London's St James's Theatre. The London company was not officially the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique, as Seveste had refused to take part and remained in France in order to prepare for the fall season in Paris. This distinction was generally ignored by the press, however. The London contingent presented a two-month season at St James's, which opened with Cabel singing in Le bijou perdu. The Illustrated London News (10 June 1854) opined that the opera was \\"exceedingly immoral--a thing of no importance in Paris, but not yet disregarded, we trust, in London.\\" Cabel also appeared as Catarina in Daniel Auber's Les diamants de la couronne and Marie in Donizetti's La fille du r√©giment. The Musical World (29 July 1854) reported in detail on Cabel's performances: > In spite of intense heat of the weather, which has helped mightily to thin > most of the London theatres, the St. James's has been attended by > fashionable audiences every evening on which the charming and fascinating > Marie Cabel has appeared. The Diamants de la Couronne has proved the most > attractive opera produced by the company of the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique, and, > independently of the superiority of Auber's music to that of any other > composer whose work has been produced, we do not hesitate to say that Madame > Marie Cabel's Caterina is the most striking and interesting character in > which she has appeared in London. Perhaps it was because it was the last, > and consequently made the deepest impression. The fair artist, however, > could hardly be of that opinion; since, on the occasion of her benefit, > Wednesday last, she selected La Fille du R√©giment in preference to Les > Diamants de la Couronne. After all it is a mere matter of choice whether > Madame Cabel's Caterina or Maria is preferable. Many doubtless think the > former, having no other reason than that they like the music of Auber better > than the music of Donizetti. > Mad. Marie Cabel was welcomed by an audience of true devotees on Wednesday > night. The hot weather seemed to have no effect upon her voice, unless it > was to render it still more soft and flexible. If Jenny Lind be entitled to > be called the \\"Nightingale,\\" and Alboni the \\"Thrush,\\" surely, without any > stretch of metaphor, Marie Cabel may be called the \\"Lark.\\" No lark, indeed, > could sing more sweetly, or pour forth its unpremeditated lay more joyously > than she on Wednesday night. Her singing was the very exhilaration of > pleasant sounds, and her acting perfection, both as the Vivandi√®re in > costume and the Vivandi√®re out of costume, as the daughter of the regiment, > and as the daughter of her newly-found mother. In the second act Madame > Cabel introduced the scene from M. Adolphe Adam's Taureador, in which the > variations on \\"Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman,\\" were introduced. This was one of > the most finished and brilliant displays of bravura singing to which we have > listened for a long time, and was a genuine triumph for Madame Cabel, who > was ably supported by MM. Legrand and Louis Cabel in the two male parts. > Madame Cabel was re-called at the end of the opera, received with > enthusiastic applause, and honoured with a shower of bouquets.\\"Dramatic. St. > James's Theatre--Opera Comique\\", The Musical World (29 July 1854), p. 502. The success of the company in London was somewhat tarnished, however, as Jules Seveste had died unexpectedly on 30 June in Meudon.Walsh 1981, p. 49. =√âmile Perrin= √âmile Perrin took over as director of the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique on 26 July 1854, while retaining his position as the director of the Op√©ra- Comique as well. Marie Cabel had been under contract to Seveste and was now free to go elsewhere, but Perrin was able to persuade her to sign a five-year contract with him for 40,000 francs per year and three months annual leave. The new season opened with Cabel in La promise.Walsh 1981, pp. 52, 54. Adolphe Adam had recently written two new works for Perrin, Le dernier balLe dernier bal was apparently never performed or published (Champlin and Apthorp 1893, p. 8). for the Op√©ra-Comique and the 3-act op√©ra-comique Le muletier de Tol√®de for the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique. It was thought that producing both works at the same time would cause jealousies to arise, so Adam was given a choice of one or the other. Since he had written Le muletier for Cabel, he did not have to think twice. The opera premiered on 16 December 1854 with Cabel in the leading soprano role of Elvire, and although it is often considered to be one of Adam's weakest works, it turned out to be one of Perrin's more successful new productions at the theatre, receiving 54 performances that year and the next. Its ephemeral success can be attributed almost entirely to Cabel. As The Musical World (30 December 1854) enthused, she was \\"neatly bound as to the feet in the very jauntiest little morocco boots‚Ä¶. She is the fauvette of the boulevards, the very sweetest of warblers; and her acting is quite equal to her singing.\\"Walsh 1981, pp. 55‚Äì56, 305. Marie Cabel in 1855 Later in the season, after a series of lackluster productions by Perrin (with the exception of a highly adapted revival of Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz called Robin des Bois on 24 January 1855), Cabel created the role of Jaguarita in Hal√©vy's Jaguarita l'Indienne (14 May 1855). This production was even more successful than and was performed a total of 124 times by the company.Walsh 1981, pp. 57‚Äì58, 60, 306. Cabel did receive some criticism in The Musical World (26 May 1855) for her appearance in this role: \\"She is chief of a Red Indian community, and she alone appears as a pale-face. She is queen of the savages, and her costume is too suggestive of a Parisian modiste. Some red ochre would be well applied‚Ä¶.\\"Quoted by Walsh 1981, p. 60. During the summer break Cabel went to Baden-Baden, but returned to open the 1855‚Äì1856 season on 1 September in Jaguarita.Walsh 1981, p. 63. It had already been announced the previous April that Perrin was leaving his position as director, and he did so on 29 September.Walsh 1981, p. 64. =Charles R√©ty= Cabel, being under contract with Perrin, followed him to the Op√©ra-Comique, but returned to the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique for the 1861‚Äì1862 season, when the company was under the direction of Charles R√©ty. She appeared in revivals of Le bijou perdu in September and Jaguarita in November. Of the former The Musical World (14 September 1861) reported that \\"the house was crowded and the reception of the brilliant songstress was of the most enthusiastic description.\\"Quoted by Walsh 1981, p. 140. By the time of Jaguarita, however the same journal (30 November 1861) complained that \\"such perverted productions as these, in which the voice is treated as an instrument of brass or wood, intended to obey merely mechanical impulses rather than the grand and noble organ of human emotion, have ruined all the best singers whom France has recently produced, and by all who have any regard for pure art, ought to be energetically reprobated.\\" Walsh remarks that when Cabel had left the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique, she had been replaced by Caroline Miolan-Carvalho \\"who seems to have refined public taste in singing.\\"Walsh 1981, p. 140. Later that season on 18 March 1862 Cabel appeared to great acclaim as F√©line in the premiere of Albert Grisar's 3-act opera La chatte merveilleuse (with a libretto based on a vaudeville by Eug√®ne Scribe). The work received a total of 72 performances that year and the next and was the greatest success of R√©ty's directorship, but was never revived.Walsh 1981, pp. 143‚Äì144, 315. =L√©on Carvalho= The following season L√©on Carvalho returned as director, replacing R√©ty, and on 30 October 1862 the company moved to its new house on the Place du Ch√¢telet. Because Carvalho's appointment had been a surprise, his wife Caroline Carvalho had accepted other engagements and was unavailable for many of the starring roles. Cabel played hard to get, insisting on a fee of more than 6,000 francs per month. Presumably she got it, because she was singing again in La chatte merveilleuse on 31 October.Walsh 1981, pp. 153‚Äì155. When Th√©ophile Semet's new opera L'ondine, which premiered on 7 January 1863, did poorly, a replacement had to be quickly brought to the stage. This turned out to be Peines d'amour perdues, a reworking of Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte in which Da Ponte's original libretto was replaced with one by Jules Barbier and Michel Carr√© which was based on Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost. The music was arranged by Prosper PascalProsper Pascal (ca. 1825‚Äì1880), French composer, music critic, and translator (Walsh 1981, p. 381.). and L√©o Delibes. Such drastic adaptations were not uncommon in the 19th century, especially in Germany, but also in France. Many of the newspaper critics who had caught wind of the preparations for this new production were aghast and were saying so. Le M√©nestrel (8 February 1863) reported that their critic had been reassured by the company that Mozart's music would remain unaltered and his \\"work will not be disparaged by exchanging the glass beads of Da Ponte for a diamond of Shakespeare.\\"Le M√©nestrel 8 February 1863, p. 75. Quoted and translated by Walsh 1981, p. 158. The \\"revival\\" had its first performance on 31 March 1863, and Marie Cabel sang the role of Rosine (Dorabella in the original, although she also sang the new words to the music of Fiordiligi's aria \\"Per piet√†\\"). Adolphe Deloffre was the conductor. Much of Mozart's music had been rearranged to fit the new plot, and the recitatives were replaced with spoken dialogue. Perhaps it is unsurprising that this production was only presented a total of 18 times. Cabel gave her last performance in it on 8 May and went to Marseille, relieving Miolan-Carvalho, who was then able to return to Paris and perform in Gounod's Faust. After this Cabel turned down L√©on Carvalho's offer for the next season and decided to go to Lyon instead.Walsh 1981, pp. 156‚Äì160, 316. At the Op√©ra-Comique After leaving the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique with Perrin to join the Op√©ra-Comique company at the end of 1855, Cabel's first creation was on 23 February 1856 in the title role of Daniel Auber's 3-act opera Manon Lescaut. The famous aria \\"√âclat de rire\\" (\\"Laughing Song\\") is said to have been created especially for her. She also appeared in Meyerbeer's L'√©toile du nord. Meyerbeer, who was trying to decide whether Cabel or Caroline Miolan-Carvalho was better suited for his new opera Le chercheur des tr√©sors (later to be titled Le pardon de Plo√´rmel or Dinorah),Meyerbeer 2004, p. 27. attended some performances and recorded in his diary on 7 August 1857 that \\"Madame Cabel remained far below my expectations.\\"Meyerbeer 2004, p. 40. By 31 October he found her \\"much better than before, without completely satisfying.\\"Meyerbeer 2004, p. 50. In the meantime, Cabel created the role of Sylvia in Ambroise Thomas' 3-act op√©ra- comique Le carnaval de Venise (first performed on 9 December 1857) in which she sang an elaborate vocalise. This opera was also attended by their Imperial Majesties.Parsons 1993, p. 204; Walsh 1981, p. 83. The Musical World (19 December 1857) wrote: \\"The execution of an air without words, imitating a 'concerto (!) for violin', as we are informed, was a prodigy of vocalisation.\\"Quoted by Walsh 1981, p. 83; the date of the work's premiere is from Forbes 1992. Cabel as Dinorah By October 1858, Meyerbeer had apparently decided on Cabel as Dinorah, since no other more suitable singer was available, and was working with her on the part.Meyerbeer 2004, pp. 41, 94‚Äì99. On 4 November 1858 Cabel created the leading soprano role in Eug√®ne Gautier's La bacchante. Despite \\"the personal success won in it by Mme Cabel\\" (according to Cl√©ment and Larousse), this work received only 3 performances.\\"le succ√®s personnel qu'y obtint Mme Marie Cabel\\", Cl√©ment and Larousse, Dictionnaire des op√©ras, 1905 revision by Pougin, vol. 1, p. 107; quoted in Meyerbeer 2004, p. 108. Meyerbeer had found that \\"Madame Cabel's assumption of the title role was very ordinary.\\"Meyerbeer 2004, p. 95. The premiere of Meyerbeer's Le pardon de Ploermel was on 4 April 1859 with Cabel singing the role of Dinorah. At the end of the performance the calls for Meyerbeer were unending, and the Emperor and Empress summoned Meyerbeer to the Royal Box, where Marie Cabel was given the honor of placing a laurel wreath upon his head.Zimmermann 1998, p. 302. Afterward Meyerbeer dared to write in his diary that he considered it \\"a brilliant success\\".Meyerbeer 2004, p. 121. The critics were also quite positive, and Cabel was praised for her \\"vertiginous-virtuoso portrayal of Dinorah.\\"Letellier 2008, p. 196. Cabel created the role of Lise in Fran√ßois- Auguste Gevaert's Le chateau trompette on 23 April 1860. This piece received a total of 25 performances. On 28 May 1866 she appeared in the premiere of Friedrich von Flotow's 2-act op√©ra-comique Zilda, which received 23 performances.Cabel's participation in these premiers is from Parsons 1993, p. 204; performance data are from Wild and Charlton 2005, pp. 188, 446. Cabel's other appearances at the Op√©ra-Comique included revivals of Auber's L'ambassadrice, Victor Mass√©'s Galath√©e, and Thomas's Le songe d'une nuit d'√©t√©. Cabel as Philine One her most important creations was on 17 November 1866, when she sang Philine in Thomas's 3-act opera Mignon. Philine's polonaise in the garden scene, \\"Je suis Titania la blonde\\", was written for Cabel at her request. Eug√®ne Ritt, the director of the Op√©ra-Comique from 1862 to 1870, later recalled: \\"Marie Cabel, who was playing Philine, asked Thomas to write her a grand aria in the garden scene. He regretfully did so.\\"Quoted by G. Loiseau, \\"La Milli√®me de Mignon\\", Le Figaro, March 13, 1894 (Lacombe 2001, pp. 22‚Äì23, 116, 355n48). Yet Cabel received high praise for her singing of it. The Musical World wrote of a performance later that season: \\"The other female part was intrusted to Madame Marie Cabel, long one of the most distinguished favourites of the Op√©ra-Comique school. It would be a matter of some difficulty to speak too highly of this most accomplished singer. Madame Cabel is no longer young; but she is still a very handsome woman, retaining full possession of her powers, and her vocalization is marked by a grace and fluency which have been rarely equalled, and possibly never surpassed. There would be something almost audacious in the fearlessness with which she dashes off her ascending scales and roulades, were it not for the ease and unconsciousness of difficulty with which she executes them; one scarcely knows which to admire most in her singing--its perfect finish or entire absence of effort. Her execution of the air, 'Je suis Titania', a brilliant and enormously difficult polonaise, was unquestionably the greatest success achieved during the night.\\"\\"Letter from Paris\\" The Musical World (27 April 1867). Cabel's last creation at the theatre was H√©l√®ne in one of Auber's last operas, the 3-act Le premier jour de bonheur (15 February 1868). This work was also successful being given 175 times up to 1873.Loewenberg 1978, column 996. Final years In the following years Cabel made guest appearances in the French provinces and Belgium. She also appeared in concerts in London in 1871. In May and June 1872 she starred in a season of French opera at London's Op√©ra-Comique in the Strand, under the management of a Sgr Montelli. Works performed included Donizetti's La fille du r√©giment, Boieldieu's La dame blanche, and Auber's L'ambassadrice.Rosenthal 1958, p. 182. She retired in 1877 due to increasing signs of mental derangement, and was eventually confined to an asylum. She died in Maisons-Laffitte.

Isotta degli Atti (late 1432 or 1433 ‚Äì 9 July 1474) was an Italian Renaissance woman and regent. She was the mistress and later wife of the condottiero and lord of Rimini, Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta. She governed Rimini as regent during the excommunication of Malatesta in 1437, as well as during the minority of their son in 1468‚Äì69. Biography She was born in Rimini, the daughter of Francesco degli Atti, a wealthy wool trader and banker. She was noticed by Sigismondo Malatesta at the age of 12 or 13, in the period when his nearby residence was being restored and the lord of Rimini was a guest of Francesco. As early as 1447 Sigismondo and Isotta had perhaps a son, Giovanni, who died as a newborn; he was buried in the Malatesta church of San Francesco. Their relationship became public only in 1449, after the death of Sigismondo's second wife, Polissena. The two married in 1456. During the period in which Sigismondo Pandolfo was excommunicated by Pope Pius II, Isotta governed Rimini on his behalf. After her husband's death (1468), she acted as regent for her son Sallustio. The latter was assassinated the following year by Roberto Malatesta, an illegitimate son of Sigismondo Pandolfo, who took control of Rimini. She died in 1474 and was buried in the church of San Francesco. She is featured in Ezra Pound's Cantos.

Named for the iconic Pan American World Airways, the series features the aircraft pilots and stewardesses of the airline as it operated in the early 1960s at the beginning of the commercial Jet Age. Pan Am premiered on ABC on September 25, 2011, and ended on February 19, 2012. ABC canceled the series on May 11, 2012. In May 2012, Sony Pictures Television had conversations with Amazon about picking up the series for a second season because of its international success. It won the \\"Best Series\\" at the Rose d'Or TV awards, Europe's equivalent of the Emmys. Unable to reach a deal with Amazon, the producers officially ended the series on June 20, 2012.Pan Am' Cancelled: ABC Series Dead\\", The Huffington Post, June 20, 2012  Cast and characters = Main  * Mike Vogel as Dean Lowrey, a Boeing 707 pilot recently promoted to captain on Pan Am's international routes and one of the youngest airline captains in the industry. A former Air Force pilot, he had been romantically involved with the crew's former purser, Bridget, and is now pursuing a relationship with Colette. Dean also finds himself in a secret relationship with Ginny, the mistress of a Pan Am vice president. * Michael Mosley as Ted Vanderway, the crew's first officer (co-pilot). A former United States Naval Aviator and test pilot, he was honorably discharged from the navy after a naval tribunal blamed him for the crash of an aircraft he was piloting even though his father (whose company manufactured the aircraft) admits to Ted in private that there was a mechanical problem. Though he is engaged to his childhood friend, Amanda, Ted slowly develops a relationship with Laura. * Christina Ricci as Margaret \\"Maggie\\" Ryan, the flight crew's idealistic and liberal-minded purser, who is not afraid to test the rules and her Pan Am superiors. Originally from Tacoma, Washington, Maggie worked as a waitress in a seedy diner after dropping out of college during her freshman year. She joined Pan Am by creating the impression that she was fluent in Portuguese because her former employer was from Brazil. * Karine Vanasse as Colette Valois, a French Pan Am stewardess. Orphaned during the German occupation of France during World War II, she still harbors resentment toward the German people. It is later on revealed that her parents were French Jews who had been killed at Dachau shortly after she was left at an orphanage. Furthermore, she has a brother who was placed for adoption; by the end of the series, Colette plans to search for him. * Margot Robbie as Laura Cameron, a stewardess newly out of training, and Kate Cameron's younger sister. Laura appears on the cover of Life magazine in her Pan Am uniform, making her a minor celebrity and a source of irritation for her older sister. Having run away from her own wedding in New Haven, Connecticut, several months prior, she struggles to grow up and prove to her sister that she can stand up on her own two feet. * Kelli Garner as Catherine \\"Kate\\" Cameron, an experienced, trilingual stewardess and Laura Cameron's older, head-strong sister. During the pilot episode, Kate is recruited by the CIA and starts taking early assignments as a covert operative. She demonstrates a flair for espionage that impresses her handlers. In the final episode, she is promoted from courier to agent.  Recurring  * David Harbour as Roger Anderson, a British MI6 agent and Kate's covert intelligence operations contact in London. It is revealed in the season finale that Anderson is a double agent for the KGB. * Jeremy Davidson as Richard Parks, Kate's CIA handler and mentor, based in New York. In the season finale, he recommends that Kate be sent to Langley for training as one of the CIA's first female field officers. *Annabelle Wallis as Bridget Pierce, an English stewardess and former Pan Am purser. She was dating Dean Lowrey before she resigned from Pan Am and vacated her flat in London following her deactivation as an MI6 courier. She recommends that Richard recruit Kate into the CIA as a courier. After Kate kills the intelligence dealer who was planning to sell a list of CIA/MI6 assets, Bridget reclaims her job at Pan Am and hopes to reclaim Dean as well. *Goran Visnjic as Niko Lonza, a Yugoslavian diplomat attached to the United Nations, serving in the United States. He becomes involved with Kate, and finds himself torn between his love of his homeland and the advantages of his new country. Visnjic appeared in a three-episode arc beginning with the season's fifth episode. *Scott Cohen as Everett Henson, a Pan Am vice president whose mistress, Ginny, has a secret affair with Dean. * Chris Beetem as Congressman Christopher Rawlings, a Republican congressman who briefly has an affair with Maggie, despite their political differences; Rawlings is a right-wing conservative and Maggie is a left-wing liberal. * Darren Pettie as Captain George Broyles, a veteran Pan Am pilot who smuggles alcohol and tobacco during his flights on the side. Despite being punched by Dean for this activity, he lures Maggie into becoming his business partner. He also saves Dean from termination by giving the investigating board an endorsement from Juan Trippe * Kal Parekh as Sanjeev, the crew's Indian flight engineer. * Jay O. Sanders as Douglas Vanderway, Ted's father and president of a major aeronautics firm. After Ted is discharged from the US Navy, Douglas has Juan Trippe hire him into Pan Am. * Piter Marek as Omar, a Wahran prince who befriends Colette after boarding a flight to Rome with no money or luggage. On the rebound from her relationship with Dean, Colette accepts Omar's advances and nearly becomes engaged to him; however, he reluctantly breaks things off after Colette consents to a background check which reveals her Jewish heritage (something which Omar's family would not accept). *Veanne Cox as Miss Havemeyer, an uptight, authoritarian Pan Am supervisor who is always at odds with Maggie. * Erin Cummings as Ginny Saddler, a mistress of Pan Am vice president Everett Henson. She becomes romantically involved with Dean behind Henson's back; however, Maggie exposes her secret affair to the vice president. When Dean urges Ginny to end their affair, she takes it hard enough to smash her face through a window in Rome. *Colin Donnell as Mike Ruskin, a columnist for The Village Voice who befriends Maggie on his trip to Berlin and publishes her scathing article on Congressman Rawlings. *Ashley Greene as Amanda Mason, Ted's childhood friend and later, love interest and fianc√©e. At a party, she unexpectedly kisses a desolate Maggie. When Ted later confronts Amanda, she admits that she feels more comfortable around women, and Ted refuses her proposal of an open marriage.  Production  Sony licensed the rights to use the Pan Am name and logo from Pan Am Systems, a New Hampshire‚Äìbased railroad company that acquired the Pan Am brand in 1998. The pilot episode cost an estimated $10 million. The series was produced by Sony Pictures Television, and was optioned by ABC in May 2011 for the 2011‚Äì2012 schedule. ABC commissioned five more scripts in November 2011. The broadcaster later added a fourteenth episode to the series. In the middle of the first season, Steven Maeda was hired as Pan Ams new showrunner, with the mandate to \\"serialize and embrace the soap aspect\\" of the show. In November 2011, there was media speculation that the series had been canceled by ABC, based on a comment from Karine Vanasse about the future of Pan Am and its absence from the mid-season schedule. The network denied the rumors; it planned to complete fourteen episodes and delay any announcement regarding a second season to a later date. The series was canceled on May 11, 2012. Although its episodes depict the characters in various cities around the world, the show was filmed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and other locations around New York City. The pilot was filmed partly at Gold Coast Studios in Bethpage on Long Island. According to Entertainment Weekly magazine, a life-size recreation of a Pan Am 707 jet is \\"the biggest star of the series‚Äîin all senses\\". The 707 model is kept in a hangar near the Brooklyn waterfront. Nancy Hult Ganis, a Pan Am stewardess from 1968 to 1976, was one of the show's executive producers and is credited as the series developer; she researched for the series at the Pan Am Historical Foundation and at Pan Am's archives at the University of Miami. In addition, Ganis advised the actors, props department, production designers, and costumers in making details for the show as accurate as possible. The program featured the trademark, sky-blue Pan Am uniforms worn by stewardesses. Costume design was overseen by Anne Crabtree, who ensured attention to detail. The department made the replicas based on an old uniform which was thoroughly studied. Twenty craftsmen worked to produce each outfit. The technique was the same used by Pan Am in the sixties, and Crabtree said the process was very \\"old school\\". At the time, girdles were mandatory to improve posture; some of the cast members found them \\"extremely restricting\\" during filming. Crabtree said that male costumes were inspired by James Dean and Steve McQueen.  Promotion  The September 12, 2011, edition of TV Guides Fall Preview issue included an advertisement on the back of the magazine, tilted upside down, featuring Ricci, Garner, Vanasse, and Robbie appearing as their characters for a fictional cover for TV Guide, using the magazine's 1960s logo. Between December 20, 2011, and January 5, 2012, the first nine episodes of the series were made available free of charge on Internet download sites in an effort to increase viewer interest in the series. Canadian Karine Vanasse responded to a question on her Twitter account by saying that the promotion was only available in the United States.  Episodes  Broadcast  The series aired in Canada on CTV on the same night as the ABC broadcasts, but was shown in different time slots by region. It also aired on CTV's sister cable channel Bravo! on Saturdays. The series premiered in Brazil and Panama on Sony Entertainment Television on March 18, 2012. In Costa Rica the channel Teletica aired Pan Am on October 15, 2012. In Ireland, the show premiered on RT√â Two on October 17. The series premiered in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on November 16, 2011. The BBC suspended its broadcast after eight episodes and stated that further episodes would return on January 28, 2012. Canal+ began broadcasting the series in Spain on October 29, 2011. The series premiered in Sweden on TV3 on October 16, 2011. On November 6, 2011, the series premiered on SIC in Portugal. On December 26, 2011, the series premiered in the Netherlands on NET 5. In Australia the series was broadcast on the Nine Network in 2012. In the Flemish part of Belgium, the airing started on Vijf on February 15, 2012., In the French part of Belgium the airing started on BeTV on May 7, 2012. In Finland the show premiered in January 2012 on Yle TV2. In Denmark, Pan Am was aired on TV3 (Danmark), TV3 Puls & TV3+ (Denmark). In Catalonia, TV3 started broadcasting the series on February 10, 2013. In South East Asia, the channel beTV (a Sony Pictures Entertainment Networks Asia, SPENA television) airs the TV Show from February 4, 2012, every Saturday at 9:00 p.m. It started airing on STAR World India from February 11, 2012. (Advertisement) In New Zealand the show premiered on November 24, 2012 with TVNZ, which rescheduled episode \\"Romance Languages\\" into chronological order to maintain series flow. It was shown every Saturday at 9:35pm on their TV One channel before being moved to a later time slot after episode 9 due to lower than expected viewing numbers.  Home media  The complete series' DVD was released on January 29, 2013 through Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. Mill Creek Entertainment re-released that format in addition to releasing the Blu-ray version on August 13, 2019.  Reception = Critical and industry reception  The show was given a 67 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 28 reviews, indicating generally favorable reception. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen rated the show highly, saying, \\"I continue to be impressed by the unapologetic way Pan Am pushes the women to the forefront of every story... I don't think Pan Am really knows what kind of show it wants to be just yet. But I also don't think that's a problem because every variation‚ÄîCold War drama, nostalgic soap opera, feminist ‚Äîhas something to offer.\\" Later episodes, however, received lower reviews for the loss of focus on the women and the addition of romantic storylines. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe gave the show a \\"B\\" grade, commenting, \\"Next to The Playboy Club it's the better network 1960s drama. The romance and the attractively stylized innocence of the era is addictive, but the espionage plot, with its link to political history, is absurd. And the female empowerment message grows feeble.\\" The Insider included Pan Am in its list of \\"10 Best New Fall TV Shows\\". Media coverage has noted that no major characters smoke, although the practice was common on flights and in the terminal during the 1960s. ABC and its parent, Disney, banned tobacco use by the show's stars. Citing \\"an enormous impressionable element\\", Thomas Schlamme called the anachronism \\"the one revisionist cheat\\", and said he had encountered a similar restriction directing a previous show for ABC. Other characters will be seen holding cigarettes in the background. In the UK, Melissa Whitworth of The Daily Telegraph said that Pan Am chose to \\"airbrush\\" the sixties because it depicts a \\"romanticised\\" view of the period. Colin Kennedy and Sharon Lougher of the Metro said the series is \\"irritatingly in love with its own sense of style\\". Though they said the storylines made it a \\"soapy guilty pleasure\\" and included it in their \\"pick of the day\\" television feature. Euan Ferguson from The Guardian praised Ricci's casting as a positive indicator of the quality of acting, but criticized the overall casting, saying similar looks and identical uniforms make it difficult for viewers to learn the characters. Emma Brockes from the Guardian said that Pan Am is \\"bubble gum bright\\" and praised the whole cast for putting in \\"strong performances\\". In Ireland, Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald said the series portrays \\"silly storylines\\" and \\"cheesy dialogue,\\" calling it \\"mile-high mediocrity\\". Scott McCartney of The Wall Street Journal noted that the show highlights the \\"elegance and excitement\\" of air travel during the early 1960s. He said that former employees of the airline thought the series is an accurate portrayal, aside from some \\"Hollywood glamorization\\". The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, the world's largest flight attendant union, released a statement following the premiere of Pan Am. It said that the show is a reminder of the progress of flight attendants in relation to previous social injustices: About the show's failure, Christina Ricci said: \\"I think it should not have been on network television. I think if that had been [on] a cable show or streaming, they would‚Äôve been able to do so much more.

It was really well made.\\"  Viewership  The series premiere attracted 11.06 million viewers, but viewership declined thereafter. The second episode attracted 7.76 million, and by the sixth episode, ratings were less than half of the show's premiere. By the season's 12th episode, audiences had fallen to 3.74 million. Following ABC's announcement of its mid-season schedule in November 2011, TV by the Numbers called Pan Am \\"defacto canceled\\", given its ratings and the fact that ABC had ordered only one further episode. A tweet by cast member Karine Vanasse (\\"Well, we received THE call, #PanAm is only coming back for one more episode after Christmas. But up to the end, we'll give it our all !\\") appeared to confirm the cancellation, though weeks later Vanasse told The Hollywood Reporter \\"what I was saying is that we would come back to shoot one more episode after Christmas.\\" In a Los Angeles Times interview published just before the season finale, showrunner Steven Maeda said that Pan Am has a \\"good upscale core of viewers\\" both live and DVR; the season finale, \\"tie[s] up some loose ends but ... also add[s] some new threads in there to explore later.

VLF systems are advantageous in that they can be manufactured to be small and lightweight; making them useful ‚Äì especially for field testing where transport and space can be issues. Because the inherent capacitance of a power cable needs to be charged when energised, system frequency voltage sources are much larger, heavier and more expensive than their lower-frequency alternatives. Traditionally DC hipot testing was used for field testing of cables, but DC testing has been shown to be ineffective for withstand testing of modern cables with polymer based insulation (XLPE, EPR). DC testing has also been shown to reduce the remaining life of cables with aged polymer insulation. VLF testing of cables is supported in IEC 60502 (up to 35 kV) and in IEEE 400.2 (up to 69 kV). As higher voltage VLF equipment is developed, standards may be adapted to increase the voltage level for application. The VLF test can be used in a number of ways: * Apply VLF to cables in a simple withstand approach to detect potential failures (faults) in the cable insulation during a planned outage. The tested cable must withstand an AC voltage for a specified testing time without flashover. This method yields a \\"pass/fail\\" statement. VLF cable testing uses different wave shapes, typically sine and square and care must be taken when describing the voltage to be used. RMS and peak voltages have different relationships to each other depending on the wave shape and IEEE 400.2 uses the peak voltage level to equate the wave shapes. Frequency ranges used are within the range of 0.01 Hz to 0.1 Hz, where frequency selection depends on the load presented by the cable. Test voltage levels are either calculated using a multiple of the cable's nominal phase-phase voltage or via tables in IEEE 400.2; typically they are in the range of 1.5 U0 to 3 U0. The VLF cable testing time varies from 15 to 60 minutes. IEEE 400.2 establishes some suggested test voltages and times. Subsequent work by the CDFI has shown there to be no significant change in the efficacy of a VLF test conducted over the frequency range 0.1 to 0.01 Hz when the IEEE 400.2 voltages and times are used. * Apply VLF to cables in a monitored withstand approach where a diagnostic measurement is made before and during the course of the withstand test. Monitoring a diagnostic enables some additional decision making before the final test voltage is reached. Some cables are not good candidates for withstand testing and a diagnostic indication obtained at a lower voltage can negate the need to perform withstand testing. During the test measurement of a diagnostic parameter can be used to optimise test times. Test times can be shortened for cables with good diagnostic indications or lengthened for cables that show deteriorating diagnostic measurements during the test. * Apply VLF to measure insulation losses (i.e. the insulation dissipation factor or Tan- delta). In this case, the IEEE 400.2 establishes the criteria for assessment. The test is typically performed over a range of test voltages from 0.5 Uo to 2 Uo depending on the standard/guide that is being followed. * Apply VLF in order to detect and measure partial discharge. In this case, the IEEE 400.3 outlines a procedure for assessment and IEC 60270 provides the background for partial discharge testing of high voltage apparatus. The test is typically performed over a range of test voltages to identify the different defects and their inception and extinction voltages.  VLF Withstand Testing  High voltage withstand tests are used in conjunction with partial discharge measurements on solid dielectric cable and accessories within manufacturing plants to ensure the quality of completed cable system components from MV to EHV. Thus, it is quite natural for utilities to also use withstand and partial discharge tests as commissioning and maintenance tests for cable systems in the field. The goal of these tests is the same as in the factory test, namely to detect any defective components of the cable system before failure. Withstand tests can be conducted using a variety of voltage sources from DC to 300 Hz and are simple to operate and the equipment may be inexpensive. Some observations for the VLF withstand test are (Based on CDFI results): * VLF tests are simple for a utility to perform and do not require specialized services * The on-test failure rates on a cable system are in the range of 0.2 to 4% for 30 min tests performed at the IEEE 400.2 voltage levels. * IEEE Std. 400.2 provides suggested time and voltage test levels but exact parameters are not possible since defect growth rates are not known and can vary widely. * VLF tests at IEEE 400.2 test levels do not damage cable systems' 'good' insulation but are used to degrade existing insulation defects to failure during the test rather than in-service. The reasoning is that the low-energy failure of the cable under test results in less collateral damage and a reduced likelihood of unplanned outages due to in-service failure. * Data has been collected using both of the commonly used VLF waveforms, there is little evidence of a significant difference in failure rate outcomes that can be ascribed to the voltage waveform when the recommend voltages are used.  VLF Tan Delta Testing  Medium voltage distribution cables and their accessories form a critical part of power delivery systems. The systems employ insulation materials that have a low permittivity and loss. The permittivity and the loss are dielectric properties of the insulation material. As the systems age, these dielectric properties can change. The dielectric loss can be assessed since it can increase several orders of magnitude during the service life of the systems. This approach correlates well some lossy growths in aged polymeric insulation such as water trees. Tan delta measurement constitutes a cable diagnostic technique that assesses the general condition of the cable system insulation, which can be represented in a simplified equivalent circuit that consists of two elements; a resistor and a capacitor. When voltage is applied to the system, the total current is the result of the contributions from the capacitor current and the resistor current. The tan delta is defined as the ratio between the resistive current and the capacitive current. The measurements are carried out offline. In practice, it is convenient to measure the dielectric properties at a VLF of 0.1 Hz. This both reduces the size and power requirements of the energizing source and increases the resolution of the resistive component (near DC component) of dielectric loss (not the capacitive component). Using the IEEE 400.2, three different criteria are applied for diagnosing a cable insulation system using the Tan Œ¥ value. One criterion uses the magnitude of the Tan Œ¥ value as a tool for diagnostics while the other uses the difference in Tan Œ¥ values for particular electrical stresses or voltage levels. The latter is commonly known as the ‚ÄúTip-Up‚Äù of the Tan Œ¥ value. The results for both criteria are often interpreted using recommendations given in the guide. The guide provides a hierarchical level that evaluates the cable insulation system. The major caveats with this approach are: * The source of the losses may need further testing in order to be located. * For longer cables the loss contributions from damaged portions may be diluted in the measurement. * Some insulation defects are not associated with losses.  VLF Partial Discharge Testing  A VLF source can be used to energise insulation and initiate partial discharges from defects within the insulation. As the test is offline, the test voltage can be varied in order to measure the inception and extinction voltages of the partial discharge. TDR techniques can be used to localise the source of the discharge and a reference measurement can be made with a calibrator in order to present the measured pd in pC. VLF PD measurements have the same benefits and limitations as other PD measurements and the data that is obtained using different voltage sources has the same uncertainties. It must be noted that different defects may exhibit different characteristics dependent upon the environment and the excitation source. The impact of this on the final decision is likely insignificant. Even at higher voltages the criteria for detection (e.g. in Cigre WG B1.28) and severity calculation are not defined and not dependent on the measured properties of the PD. Therefore, the detection of PD sources is currently more important than the characterisation of the defects. Detection of defects is especially useful for new cables where the severity analysis is perhaps less important to the decision that is made. Any defects in new installations should be corrected. For aged systems the PD severity can be assessed by consideration of the various PD characteristics. Unfortunately there is no independent guide that can be used to classify the severity after a single measurement. A trend can be established from repeat measurements and it is therefore important that measurement conditions are carefully controlled and repeated so that the comparison of repeated measurements is valid. Typical characteristics of PD that can contribute to severity analysis include: * Inception and extinction voltages * PD type classification (Internal, surface, corona) * PD Magnitude (in mV/pC) * PD repetition rate * Location of defect  Comparison with other voltage sources  There is some industry debate (much of it commercially driven) over the use of different voltage sources to energise cables and on the benefits of the different diagnostic techniques when used in conjunction with the different sources. Theoretical Approach The cable is subject to operational stresses at the system voltage and frequency and voltage sources that are different (in magnitude, waveshape or frequency) will provide different stresses to the cable than those experienced under operational conditions. Defects and damage may also respond differently and the diagnostic indications may be different depending upon the types of defects. Proponents of this approach will argue that these differences detract from the commercial benefits offered by the competing voltage sources. Practical Approach Electrical equipment has a failure rate which is the inverse of its reliability. Test techniques have the intention of improving the reliability of the insulation system and an analysis of the impact of the testing on the reliability of the network under test is evidence of the efficacy of the test technique; irrespective of the differences from operational stresses. Probability Insulation failure is a stochastic process and it is erroneous to identify single events and attribute this to a particular source. Failure of an insulation system after a good diagnostic indication (or vice versa) is to be expected for any test using any voltage source. Better tests will be better predictors of condition but no tests should be considered infallible.

Early life and education  Mehr Chand Khanna was an ethnic Punjabi born in Peshawar on 1 June 1897 to Karam Chand Khanna, a rich businessman. He had his schooling in Peshawar and graduated from Edwardes College, Peshawar. Khanna also graduated in law and practised for a time as a lawyer.  Politics  Mehr Chand Khanna entered politics at an early age and founded the Hindu Sabha. In 1926, he served as member of the Peshawar Cantonment Board, as a Hindu representative. He served for some time as a member of the Frontier Crimes Regulations Enquiry Committee set up by the Government of India. In 1932, he was elected to the North West Frontier Province Assembly from the Peshawar Cantonment constituency as a member of the Hindu-Sikh Nationalist Party. When the Frontier National Congress captured power in the province in the 1937 elections and Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan became the Premier, Khanna, whose party was in winning alliance, was made the Minister of Finance. Khanna was the only Hindu minister in the cabinet. He was also the only cabinet minister who was not related to Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan. Khanna served as the Minister of Finance from 1937 to 1939, when Congress ministries all over India resigned in protest against Britain's declaration of war against Germany. He also served as Minister of Finance in the second Frontier Congress cabinet which ruled from 1945 to 1947.  Arrest  Khanna was serving as a cabinet minister in the NWFP government when the dominion of Pakistan was formed on 14 August 1947. However, the government was dismissed soon afterwards. In January 1948 Khanna was arrested along with Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan on charges of possessing firearms and lodged in Peshawar jail. The Indian government sent Anglo-Indian lawyer Frank Anthony to secure his release as no Hindu lawyer was willing to travel to Pakistan. Upon his release Khanna migrated to India and settled down in Delhi.  In the Indian government  Khanna participated in the Lok Sabha elections in independent India and was elected from the New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency. He served as Minister of Rehabilitation in the Jawaharlal Nehru cabinet from 1954 to 1962. Being a refugee himself, he is believed to have handled the refugee problem well. From 1954 to 1957, he also handled the law portfolio. During the 1960s, he was also giving the portfolio of housing.  Death  Khanna died on 20 July 1970 in Delhi at the age of 73.

The name comes from the Roman name for the city, Noviomagus Reginorum. The museum, designed by the architect Keith Williams following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions, has an area of 1,300 sq m which is approximately 2.4 times the size of the previous museum in Little London. The building is divided into three floors each of which will contain a gallery for exhibition. It contains a research and learning room as well as a collection store for the social history collection. The museum is built directly over the top of the Chichester's Roman Bath House complex which are displayed in the ground floor gallery. The museum has over 350,000 objects of geological, archaeological and social historic interest. The social history and geological collections is made up of some 50,000 objects which are housed within the new building, whilst the archaeological collection is contained in a purpose built store within the Discovery Centre located at Fishbourne Roman Palace. The museum was opened on 8 July 2012. History of Chichester District Museum In 1831, Dr John Forbes decided to form a Philosophical and Literary Society in Chichester and, as one of the objectives of this society, Chichester Museum was founded as a Natural History collection. The museum was initially located in the Royal West Sussex Hospital, and the collection was formed from donations from the general public. The Museum was later relocated to 45 South Street after plans for a move to 7 North Pallant where abandoned due to financial difficulty. In 1851 interest in the museum was motivated by the Great Exhibition in London, and the decision of the Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland to hold their annual conference in Chichester. This led to a boom of local interest in local heritage, and extensive excavations were carried out in the area. The 1890s saw a dramatic decline in interest, which led to the unfortunate decision to sell artefacts to support the museum. In 1914 the museum building was commandeered by the army and rumours of wanton destruction of the remaining exhibits. By 1924 there was little left of the museum and the collection had been completely sold. During the 1930s, a wave of interest led to attempts to resurrect the museum. However, the City Corporation showed little interest in funding the venture. Finally in 1936 a two-week exhibition was displayed in the Guildhall, Priory Park using artefacts that had been collected over the previous three years. This led to the Guildhall becoming a store for artefacts collected over the next 25 years. In 1961 another temporary exhibition was opened in the Assembly Rooms which inspired a local architect to purchase a disused Corn Mill, which he offered to lease to the council for the specific purpose of opening a museum. In 1962, the new museum opened its doors under the name of Chichester Museum with displays of 18th-century local art, and was formally opened in April 1964 by the Duchess of Richmond. The collection has increased dramatically since its opening due to the extensive archaeological work that has been ongoing in the area. In 1974 the museum was renamed the Chichester District Museum to reflect its direct association with the District Council. The most recent event in the museum's history was the closure of the Little London Corn Mill in anticipation of the move into the museum's new premises and name as The Novium. History of the site Evidence for the Roman baths was first identified in 1960 during works at the rear of Morant's Store, later the Army and Navy store. This first observation identified a section of black and white mosaic along with a fragment of wall. Further archaeological excavation was undertaken in 1972 during the construction of the Post Office Building. At that time the site was scheduled to become a multi-storey car park, the construction of which would have meant the complete destruction of all archaeological layers.

In 1879, the first graduating class consisted of three members. By 1883, the high school curriculum was expanded to three years and in 1889, it was expanded to four years. In 1995, Lorain High School was closed and became Lorain Middle School, which was later closed in 2005. In the fall of 2010, following the merger of Lorain Admiral King High School and Lorain Southview High School, Lorain High School reopened as the Lorain High School Titans, with navy blue and silver as their colors and operated in the former Lorain Southview High School building as construction began for the new building. The all new Lorain High School complex opened in 2016. History Prior to the organization of the area's first public school, subscription classes were taught by David Smith of Amherst. These classes were held in an old log cabin location at the intersection of Oberlin Avenue and First Street. On November 9, 1827, the house holders of the village met to discuss the education of their children. A school board was elected and two hundred dollars was appropriated for the purpose of building a schoolhouse for the youngsters of Lorain. It was suggested that a schoolhouse to be built on the west side of town; later, it was agreed upon and a small building was constructed. Miss Lucria Smith was employed to teach the boys and girls who were of school age. After twenty years of service, the little schoolhouse became inadequate and classes were held in the old meetinghouse at the corner of Washington and West Erie Avenues. When the village of Charleston was incorporated in 1836, it became part of the township system. A lot was, therefore, set aside for school use, although no schoolhouse was built on it for several years. During 1853, a two- story frame building was constructed on Fourth Street. This was the only schoolhouse within the limits of the town until 1870 when a four-room, two story brick building was completed. The cost of this building, which later became a part of the high school, was fifteen thousand dollars. The building site had been purchased for an additional two thousand dollars. As early as 1862 there was a tax levied for the township schools, and the first school census that same year showed 187 people of school age living in (Lorain). By 1872, the number increased to 199. In 1871, the first formal adoption of textbooks occurred and the students soon after began using McGuffery's readers, Ray's arithmetic and Harvey's grammar books. Strictly speaking, the public schools of the city of Lorain began in 1874 when Lorain became incorporated. Benjamin F. Bellows was the first superintendent. He, along with one assistant, Miss Kirkbridge, were the entire teaching staff. The following year, Miss Hannah E. Burett became the third member of the faculty. In 1876, the schools were divided into primary, grammar and high school departments. A two-year high school course was developed and in 1879 the first class, consisting of two boys and one girl, was graduated from Lorain High School. By 1883, the high school curriculum was expanded to three years; in 1889, it was expanded to four years. The first wing of Lorain High School was completed in 1916 and dedication exercises were held on May 12 of that year. The second wing of the building was completed in 1917 and the two wings included ninety two rooms, a gymnasium-stage and an auditorium. Located at Sixth Street and Washington Avenue, Lorain High School was expanded and remodeled three times since the second wing of the high school was built in 1917 before closing in 1995. In the late 1930s, an Arts building was completed when it became necessary to expand the industrial arts program. In 1962, a three unit gymnasium and a new home economics department were built and a new cafeteria and a two-level media center were added in 1972. In 1995, Lorain High School was closed and merged with Admiral King High School, changing the name to Lorain Admiral King High School and remaining in the latter's building. Lorain Middle School was opened that fall in the former Lorain High School building and retained the previous high school's mascot and colors until closing in 2005. Lorain High School reopened in late August 2010, with their colors being navy blue and silver and the new mascot being the Titans. The high school was previously housed in the former Lorain Admiral King High School building until 2012, where it was moved to the former Lorain Southview High School and the newly constructed Southview Middle School to make way for the construction of Lorain High School at the site of the former Lorain Admiral King High School on 2600 Ashland Avenue. Grade 9 is located in the Lorain High School Annex at 2321 Fairless Drive, along with Credit Recovery Academy, due to lack of space for the entire student body in the current building. Grades 10-12 are located in Lorain High School at 2270 E 42nd Street. On October 24, 2012, a groundbreaking ceremony was held at the new site for Lorain High School. The new building's cost amounts to $73 million and will be 330,000 square feet. School officials claim the building will rival college or university buildings and give students a chance to compete with others around the world. Construction on the new site for Lorain High School was completed in 2016; in time for students to begin attending in August. The doors were opened to students on August 24, 2016. Sports and recreation 100px Physical education in Lorain City Schools is said to have begun in 1894, the year Lorain High School first played a three-game football schedule. 1917 is generally regarded as the turning point in Lorain's physical education program. In that year, the second wing of the high school was completed and it included a gymnasium. Since that time, physical education has been a required course in the schools. The Lorain Board of Educated purchased a tract of land for a recreation field in 1919. A football field was laid out and a track was constructed on the land known as Longfellow Field. This field had poor drainage, and, as a result, many of the football games and track meets were held on water soaked and muddy grounds. The 1920s brought an increase in physical education activities. The four junior high schools were built during that time, adding four gymnasiums to the school system. Also, during the early 1920s, Lorain High School joined the Lake Erie League and soon after the Board of Education realized that Longfellow Field was not adequate for playing league games. In 1927, the Board of Education purchased a fourteen and one- half acres of land on Oberlin Avenue to be used as a stadium for football and track. The field cost $40,000. The public school children agreed to raise $15,000 if the Board of Education gave $25,000. The children raised the money by means of carnivals, candy sales, plays, operettas, paper drives and athletic events. The football stadium on Oberlin Avenue is a tribute to the hard work of the citizens of Lorain. Originally known as Recreation Field, its name was changed in 1958 to George Daniel Field in honor of the man who served as teacher, coach and athletic director for more than fifty years. George Daniel, a three-sport athlete at Lorain High School at the turn of the century and a track star at Ohio Wesleyan University, coached football at Lorain High School until he was named the first supervisor of physical education. George Daniel, a 1905 LHS graduate, became Lorain High's second athletic coach in 1910. Although Lorain High School students participated in sports prior to 1911, it was in that year that Daniel was instrumental in forming the \\"Little Big Four\\" league, which consisted of Lorain High School, Elyria High School, Sandusky High School, and Norwalk High School. The league later expanded to include Fremont, Bellevue, and Oberlin, and the name was changed to the \\"Little Big Seven.\\" The two-semester system with promotions twice a year was begun, and the first mid-year graduation was held in 1911, the same year that work on the new Lorain High School building was begun. 1912 was the first year that the Lorain High School football team, under coach Daniel, went undefeated, also achieving this feat in 1914 and 1916. In 1922 the Lorain High basketball team was winner of the first Ohio High School Athletic Association Class Title. The school became champion of the Lake Erie League in 1927 for Football. During the 1960s, Lorain High School played in the Buckeye Conference alongside teams from Findlay, Sandusky, Fremont Ross, Admiral King High School, Mansfield, Marion, and Elyria. In 2014, the new Lorain High made its first splash real in athletics. The football team made the playoffs for the first time and the basketball team powered to a 25-1 record, reaching the sweet sixteen of the Division I State Tournament.

It was established on 29 October 1915 by the Brooklyn-based Vitagraph Studios and the Hearst Corporation, and produced its first reel in February 1916, but folded in 1916. Previously, Hearst had produced newsreels together with the Selig Polyscope Company from 1914 on, and after the deal with Vitagraph ended Hearst teamed up with Path√©. Another of the Hearst-Vitagraph Krazy Kat animated shorts The cartoons which were added to the newsreels were created by Hearst's animation studio International Film Service, led by Gregory La Cava, which converted popular comic strips from the Hearst newspapers to the big screen. Included in the News Pictorial were Parcel Post cartoons created by Frank Moser (who animated most of the other ones as well), George Herriman's Krazy Kat (at least eight shorts), And Her Name Was Maud and Happy Hooligan by Frederick Burr Opper, Daffydil and Judge Rummy by Tad Dorgan, The Katzenjammer Kids by Harold Knerr, Bringing Up Father by George McManus, Joys and Glooms by T. E. Powers, and Jerry on the Job by Walter Hoban. The newsreels were created by a staff of about 56 cameramen, and produced a number of scoops, including images of the sinking of the British ship HMS Audacious in 1914, and the sinking of the German ship SMS Bl√ºcher in 1915.

Major national holidays were therefore controlled by Joseph Goebbels at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, and were often accompanied by mass meetings, parades, speeches and radio broadcasts. Many of the official national holidays in the Third Reich were anniversaries of political events, namely the seizure of power (January 30), the announcement of the Party program in 1920 (24 February), Hitler's birthday (20 April) and the Beer Hall Putsch (9 November). Others were traditional German holidays. Heroes' Memorial Day was celebrated on 16 March, National Labour Day on 1 May, Mothering Sunday in May, Summer Solstice in June, Harvest Thanksgiving in Autumn and Winter Solstice in December.

They have been the centerpiece of several radio BBC, PRI and international radio stories. History The label's first two releases, Nosferatu D2's We're Gonna Walk Around This City With Our Headphones on to Block Out the Noise and Benjamin Shaw's I Got the Pox, the Pox Is What I Got, brought the label attention and proved popular with alternative press like Drowned in Sound, The Skinny and Pitchfork and radio stations such as BBC 6 Music, Triple R, Resonance FM and NME Radio. They also gained notable supporters in Gareth of Los Campesinos! and Nic Dalton of The Lemonheads. In 2011, the label released a series of EPs from Ex-Hefner man Jack Hayter, Broken Shoulder, Wartgore Hellsnicker, Paul Hawkins & The Awkward Silences and Fighting Kites. The label also put together a well received charity compilation album, to raise money for Japan entitled Bob Hope Would, which they followed up with a charity busk for Japan in Greenwich, London from Jack Hayter. 2011 saw the label's profile slowly begin to rise. Label founder Jamie Halliday was interviewed by Tom Robinson on BBC 6 Music and wrote a \\"Do and Don't\\" guide to running an independent label for the BBC site, while the label was featured in a short list of recommended labels on the Johnny Foreigner blog, and described as \\"possibly the greatest one man label in the world\\" by the Another Form of Relief blog. The label ended 2011 with the debut LP from Benjamin Shaw (There's Always Hope, There's Always Cabernet) which was well received in the music press and by BBC 6 Music before kicking off 2012 with a second charity compilation, Some.Alternate.Universe, this time for FSID to raise money for their efforts to prevent Infant Death Syndrome. The compilation featured more established artists like Jeffrey Lewis, Jonah Matranga, Art Goblins, Internet Forever, Johnny Foreigner and more. They are now working on a year long series of singles from Jack Hayter entitled The Sisters of St. Anthony. On 29 August 2012, Audio Antihero and Nosferatu D2 were featured in a retrospective piece for the BBC World Service/PRI production \\"The World\\" ‚Äì which featured interviews with label founder Jamie Halliday and Nosferatu D2 vocalist Ben Parker. The Nosferatu D2 song \\"We'll Play 'The Power of Love' by Frankie Goes to Hollywood a Thousand Times Tonight\\" closed the show. In November 2012, Audio Antihero contributed the H√ºsker Doo-wop EP to the Hear It for New York pop-up shop. The EP was released to raise money for the Independent Music Community in New York that was affected by Hurricane Sandy and featured rare/exclusive songs from Nosferatu D2, Benjamin Shaw, Jack Hayter, Superman Revenge Squad and Wartgore Hellsnicker. They followed up this charity EP with This Christmas (I Just Want to Be Left Alone), a Christmas single from Benjamin Shaw & Fighting Kites to raise money for Shelter. The single benefited from critical praise from online press/radio and support from Tom Robinson and Jon Solomon at WPRB. When promoting the single, label founder Jamie Halliday co-hosted The Wrong Rock Show on the legendary Bush Radio, the appearance was endorsed by Rolling Stone. Audio Antihero kicked off 2013 with a new single from Jack Hayter entitled \\"Charlotte Badger,\\" a live appearance on the local Croydon Radio station and two guest articles for the GoldFlakePaint music site, a guest interview with Jeffrey Lewis in January and a retrospective \\"Paint It Back\\" feature on Gary Numan's Pure album in February. Following the finale of Jack Hayter's \\"Sisters of St. Anthony\\" series, Audio Antihero released a charity compilation entitled \\"REGAL VS STEAMBOAT\\" to raise money for Rape Crisis England & Wales and Rape Crisis Scotland. The compilation featured artists such as Darren Hayman, Ace Bushy Striptease, Jeffrey Lewis, Bored Nothing, David Cronenberg's Wife and more and was praised by The Quietus, The Skinny and more.

It is located in the Hamburg, Germany quarter of Eppendorf, in the borough of Hamburg-Nord.  History  The area of Kellinghusenpark and around the station used to be owned by a Hamburg mayor, Dr. Heinrich Kellinghusen (1796 - 1879). After a station called Oderfelder Stra√üe had originally been planned south-west of the current station, the plans were revised to include a branch line to Ohlsdorf, with the new station having four lines. The architects for the new station were Ludwig Raabe und Otto W√∂hleke, who also designed Landungsbr√ºcken and Mundsburg stations, and the stone figures decorating the station were sculptured by Johann Michael Bossard (1874-1950). Kellinghusenstra√üe station was built from 1909 to 1910 on an embankment for which some houses needed to be demolished. When the station opened on 10 May 1912, it was a terminus for trains from Barmbeck, now Barmbek. From 25 May 1912, it was no longer a terminal, as the trains ran to Millerntor, now St. Pauli. These trains used the outer two lines of the four. The inner two lines were used from 1 December 1914, when the line from Kellinghusenstra√üe to Ohlsdorf was opened, and the station was a terminus for that line until 2 June 1929, when the line was extended to Stephansplatz. In the meantime, in 1926, a bridge designed by Walther Puritz was built between the two platforms at the south end after they had been lengthened from 60 to 90 meters.  Location  The station is close to the 1914-built art deco Holthusenbad swimming baths and to Kellinghusenpark, and is on the corner of Kellinghusenstra√üe and Goernerstra√üe.  Station layout  The station is on an embankment with two island platforms, joined by a bridge at the south end. There is an exit at its north end on the corner of Kellinghusenstra√üe and Goernerstra√üe, with steps and elevators leading to each platform. On the entrance level is a shop, which also sells tickets, but no lockerboxes. No personnel attends the station but there are ticket machines, CCTV, and emergency and information telephones.

SAP-FL strives to provide evidence-based policy advice, tools and services to enable governments, employers‚Äô and workers‚Äô organizations and other partners to take effective, coordinated and rights-based action to prevent and eradicate forced labour. SAP-FL indicates that all human trafficking leads to forced labour.  Organizational background  SAP-FL advocates and communicates so that policy makers and the public become aware of forced labour, the harm it causes to men, women and children, and what they can do to combat it. Their work at global level is complemented by field-based operational projects which set out to develop, test and demonstrate the effectiveness of a distinct ILO approach to combating different manifestations of forced labour and human trafficking.  ILO Forced Labour Conventions  ILO Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), provides a general prohibition of the use of forced labour admitting only five exceptions to it. Its object and purpose is to suppress the use of forced labour in all its forms irrespective of the nature of the work or the sector of activity in which it may be performed. ILO Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105), supplements Convention No. 29 by defining specific circumstances under which forced labour is never allowed. The use of forced labour is now almost universally banned, since the Conventions Nos. 29 and 105 are the most widely ratified of all ILO Conventions with 177 and 172 ratifications respectively. The 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work commits ILO member states to respect, promote and realize the principle of the elimination of all forms of forced labour as one of the four fundamental principles, even if they have not ratified the forced labour Conventions.  International definitions = Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29)  The article 2 of Convention No. 29 defines [forced labour] as: \\"all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.\\"ILO Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), Art. 2 The key elements of this definition are:Eradication of forced labour - General Survey concerning the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), and the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105) - (2007) Menace of any penalty is to be understood in a very broad sense. It can be direct or indirect physical violence, psychological coercion or economic compulsion used against a worker, his/her relatives or close associates. The penalty does not only refer to penal sanctions, but may also take the form of a loss of rights or privileges. For example, imprisonment or other physical confinement, financial penalties, dismissal from employment or loss of promotion, threat of denunciation to authorities, or deprivation of food, shelter or other necessities may constitute a menace of a penalty. The absence of a voluntary offer refers to the principle that all work relations should be founded on the mutual consent of the contracting parties. The worker must have a right to freely choose to enter into employment and also freely leave the employment at any time with reasonable notice in accordance with national law or collective agreement. The consent to work has to be freely given and informed, and exist throughout the employment relationship. This means that there is never voluntary offer under coercion or threat, neither when deception and fraud are used. Besides, the given consent is also considered irrelevant when it is obtained by abusing the vulnerability of the worker. All work or service includes all types of work, service and employment, regardless of the industry or sector within which it is found, including occupations not considered as employment in certain countries, such as begging, prostitution or domestic service in private household. It encompasses legal and formal employment as well as illegal and informal employment. Any person includes any human being ‚Äì adult or child. It is considered irrelevant whether the person is a national of the country or whether the person works legally or illegally in the country. =Means of coercion= A case of forced labour is essentially determined by the nature of the relationship between a worker and an ‚Äòemployer.‚Äô The crucial element is the coercion on the part of the employer or recruiter and the lack of free, informed consent of the worker. Thanks to this broad definition and the elements provided in it, the Convention is a ‚Äòliving instrument‚Äô that covers traditional forms of forced labour as well as contemporary forms, for example, those linked to human trafficking. In practice, forced labour is a situation where a person is not free to leave his or her work because of threats, debts, or other forms of physical or psychological coercion. Some examples of means of coercion: ‚Ä¢ Physical or sexual violence against workers or their family ‚Ä¢ Restriction of movements ‚Ä¢ Deprivation of food ‚Ä¢ Debt bondage / manipulated debt ‚Ä¢ Withholding or non-payment of wages ‚Ä¢ Retention of identity documents ‚Ä¢ Threat of denunciation to authorities ‚Ä¢ Kidnapping or abduction ‚Ä¢ Sale of the person ‚Ä¢ Slave status by birth ‚Ä¢ Deception /false promises about work =Exceptions= The Convention specified some exceptions, such as:* ILO Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), Art. 2 ‚Ä¢ Compulsory military service for work of purely military character ‚Ä¢ Work or service performed as part of normal civic obligations, such as jury duty ‚Ä¢ Work or service performed in emergency situations, such as flood, fire, famine, earthquake ‚Ä¢ Minor communal services, provided that members of community agree on need for services Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105) ILO Convention No. 105 on Abolition of Forced Labour specifies that forced labour, as defined by Convention No. 29, can never be used as means of political coercion, for the purpose of economic development, discrimination, labour discipline or as a punishment for having participated in strikes ILO Convention No. 105 strengthens ILO Convention No. 29 on Forced Labour by requiring the abolition of forced labour:ILO Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105) Art. 1 ‚Ä¢ As means of political coercion or education or as punishment for political views ‚Ä¢ As means of mobilizing labour for economic development ‚Ä¢ As means of labour discipline ‚Ä¢ As punishment for strikes ‚Ä¢ As means of racial, social, national or religious discrimination Forms of forced labour Forced labour can take many forms. While the initial emphasis in combating forced labour was on state-imposed practices, the majority of forced labour takes place in the private economy and the coercion takes indirect and subtle forms, making it more difficult to combat forced labour. The main forms of forced labour include:Forced Labour: Definition, Indicators and Measurement, ILO Working Paper by Kanchana N. Ruwanpura, Pallavi Rai, 2004 ‚Ä¢ Debt-induced forced labour, commonly referred to as ‚Äòbonded labour‚Äô or ‚Äòdebt bondage,‚Äô under which labourers and their families are forced to work for an employer in order to pay off their actually incurred or inherited debts. The labour service is rarely defined or limited in duration, and it tends to be manipulated in such a way that it does not pay off the debt. ‚Ä¢ Forced labour as an outcome of trafficking in persons, fuelled by organised criminal networks or individuals. It can begin with the contacting of an employment agency offering work abroad. Once recruited and transported to the destination country, workers‚Äô employment conditions are changed, documents withheld, and coercion is applied, resulting in forced labour. ‚Ä¢ Practices of slavery, still in existence, transmitted by birth to individuals from certain ethnic groups, who are compelled to work for their masters. ‚Ä¢ State-imposed forms of forced labour, such as prison labour when prisoners are forced to work for profit- making private enterprises; military labour when civilians are forced to work for government or the military; or compulsory work on public construction projects.

The upper surfaces have neither a discal spot nor transverse lines. Each abdomen segment of the abdomen has paired patches of tiny spines which show through the scales. The resting position is horizontal with the front end raised and the cilia give the hind tip a frayed and upturned look if the wings are rolled around the body.

The IPS brought together a loose affiliation of surf contests around the world by forming one world circuit. The IPS was formed by Fred Hemmings and Randy Rarick in October 1976. Hemmings contacted directors of the major events in the world and formed the circuit, Peter Burness of South Africa, Bill Bolman of Australia and Kevin Sieter of California were instrumental in the early success of the pro surfing world circuit, A women's division was added in 1977, administered by athlete turned organizer Patti Paniccia, with Margo Oberg being the first IPS Women's World Champion. Two important IPS developments were the introduction of the man-on-man format in 1977 and the addition of California to the tour schedule in 1981. In 1982, the self- described \\"Bronze Aussies,\\" Peter Townend and Ian Cairns, saw an opportunity to take over the IPS in order to form their own business, and their criticism of the organization initiated its demise. In January 1983 Ian Cairns launched the Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP) and lured world circuit organizers to his organization. The IPS and Hemmings were effectively pushed aside and left to operate only his Hawaiian pro events. Hemmings and Randy Rarick incorporated the famous Triple Crown Surfing events, Then in December 1984 the IPS-controlled Pipeline Masters received an ASP sanction as a specialty event.

John Mansel was born in Cosgrove, Northamptonshire, in 1729, and married Mary Anne Biggin. The couple had two sons, John, who became a major in the army, and Robert, who joined the Royal Navy and rose to the rank of rear admiral. In the army Mansel was made lieutenant-colonel commanding the 3rd Dragoon Guards on 27 April 1775 and became colonel of the regiment on 16 May 1781. Promoted to major-general on 28 April 1790, he commanded the 2nd (heavy) brigade of cavalry under the Duke of York and Albany in the Flanders Campaign from May 1793. He was at the relief of Menin on 15 September,Burne p.84 and possibly at Sainghin on 27 October, although the heavy cavalry was apparently commanded by Prince Ernest on the day, as Mansel was not yet divisional commander. In 1794 he was with Erskine's column at Pr√©mont on 17 April, but at the Battle of Villers-en-Cauchies on the 24th his command missed the action through a confusion in the orders that left Rudolf Ritter von Otto with just four squadrons to face 5,000 French. At Beaumont on 26 April he led the cavalry flank attack in the valley of Cawdry and completely routed a column of infantry before plunging at the head of his troops across a ravine to attack a battery of 14 cannon on the other side. > \\"He passed the ravine, and, at the head of a considerable body of his men, > charged the cannon with inconceivable intrepidity, and complete success.

(K)arophite Black refers to the combining of Carbon Black from the original nCode racquets with graphite and SiO2 to create a dense and strong racquet matrix. (K)onnector refers to the two wings molded on each side of the racquet that increase dwell time of the ball when it hits the racquet thereby providing more control and comfort as well as a larger sweet spot. (K)ontour Yoke refers to cross-sectional shape of the frame that enhances stiffness to increase stability of the racquet.

Bill Barrett, Martha Graham Ensemble, 2007‚Äì2008, Fabricated Bronze, 12' x 18' x 8'  Steel  Barrett began welding while a student at the University of Michigan. His early works consisted of steel rods, joined together to create open, three-dimensional drawings. For subsequent sculptures, he filled in the negative space between the rods with molten metal and steel plates. From here, Barrett developed a technique of cutting steel sheets into rectangular shapes and forming the shapes into three-dimensional blocks or cylindrical forms.Palmedo (2003), pp. 19‚Äì27. He also explored the surface of steel, grinding or brushing the surface to give his finished work texture. Barrett later painted his steel sculptures to prevent the final pieces from rusting.Palmedo (2003), pp. 31‚Äì33.  Aluminum  Bill Barrett, Hari IV, 1982, Fabricated Aluminum, 32' x 30' x 16' Barrett's work with aluminum began in 1960's.

Keeping contemporary culture in mind, Barrett's title for this work comes from a graffiti \\"tag\\" that was appearing on New York City Subway cars at the time. The work was well received by the students, earning the nickname \\"the elephant\\". It became the high school's symbol, being used on the yearbook cover and adorning the football team's helmets.

As his interest in expressive forms grew, Barrett found that wax gave him the creative freedom to model shapes. He created a technique of pouring wax into a baking tin, drawing the shapes in the wax, and then combining the shapes to create a model, twisting and carving away at each shape by hand. The most successful models were cast into bronze and the bronze maquettes were then fabricated into larger bronze sculptures.Palmedo (2003), pp. 54‚Äì55. From the '90s on, Barrett's bronze works took on a free-flowing quality that suggested calligraphy, movement, dance and music. Several sculptures from this decade refer directly to dance.Palmedo (2003), pp. 88‚Äì111.

A baseband processor typically uses its own RAM and firmware. Baseband processors are typically fabricated using CMOS (complementary metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor) or RF CMOS technology, and are widely used in radio-frequency (RF) and wireless communications.  Overview  Baseband processors typically run a real-time operating system (RTOS) as their firmware, such as ENEA's OSE, Nucleus RTOS (iPhone 3G/3GS/iPad), ThreadX (iPhone 4), and VRTX. There are more than a few significant manufacturers of baseband processors, including Broadcom, Icera, Intel Mobile Communications (former Infineon wireless division), MediaTek, Qualcomm, Spreadtrum, and ST- Ericsson. The rationale of separating the baseband processor from the main processor (known as the AP or application processor) is threefold: ; Radio performance : Radio control functions (signal modulation, encoding, radio frequency shifting, etc.) are highly timing-dependent, and require a real-time operating system. ; Legal : Some authorities (e.g. the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)) require that the entire software stack running on a device which communicates with the cellular network must be certified. Separating the BP into a different component allows reusing them without having to certify the full AP. ; Radio reliability : Separating the BP into a different component ensures proper radio operation while allowing application and OS changes.  Security concerns  Since the software which runs on baseband processors is usually proprietary, it is impossible to perform an independent code audit. By reverse engineering some of the baseband chips, researchers have found security vulnerabilities that could be used to access and modify data on the phone remotely. In March 2014, makers of the free Android derivative Replicant announced they have found a backdoor in the baseband software of Samsung Galaxy phones that allows remote access to the user data stored on the phone.

In 1910, Piern√© arranged the music into two orchestral suites. Structure of the music Although the composition is melancholic, like Basque music in general, one of the main characters of these suites is the quintuple rhythm of the zortziko, which appears in the first half of the Overture and the latter part of the Rapsodie. The structure of the suites is as follows: Suite No. 1Suite No. 2=The production The play takes place in the French Basque Country, and describes its scenery and its way of life. But above all it is about its young hero, Ramuntcho. The turning point in a not very eventful story comes when Ramuntcho, smuggler and pelota champion, returns to his village after three years of military service and finds that Gracieuse, whom he was expecting to marry in spite of her mother‚Äôs opposition, has been coerced into entering a convent. And there, in spite of Ramuntcho‚Äôs efforts, she stays. In the last scene, Gracieuse is challenged by her Mother Superior to make the choice between God and her lover, applying so much emotional pressure that the young nun drops dead under the stress of it. Piern√©‚Äôs incidental music contributed significantly to the success of the production. It was greeted at the time as ‚Äòfull of the conflicting languor, passion and religious fervour of the Basque Country‚Äô, and supplied much of the local colour so lovingly described in the novel but difficult to represent on the stage. The Overture to the play, which opens Suite No. 1, the first of two orchestral suites drawn from the Ramuntcho music in 1910, is a demonstration of how seriously and at the same time how entertainingly Piern√© set about creating an authentically Basque backdrop. Rather than designing a unified symphonic construction, he put together a sequence of episodes each with a rhythmically distinctive zortzico in time, its own Basque material. The overture is followed by the serene, delicate and atmospheric Gracieuse‚Äôs Garden. It is set where Ramuntcho and the chaste Gracieuse had their secret meetings, is an idyllic inspiration featuring an expressive exchange between two flutes. On his return to the village from military service he finds her mother Franchita close to death ‚Äì an event anticipated in Franchita‚Äôs Room, which is chilling in its minor harmonies on muted horns, dark in its bassoon and cello colours, desolate in a solo viola‚Äôs musing on a Basque lament. Ramuntcho and Gracieuse also used to meet at village dances such as that represented here by a fandango with picturesque interventions from a pair of piccolos and a drum echoing the pipe-and-tabor bands of the region. Suite No. 2 begins with the Cider House which reflects the conviviality of the place where Ramuntcho and his smuggler companions would plot their sorties into Spain and, no doubt, entertain themselves with folk tunes like the two introduced separately at first and combined in the closing bars. The Convent is a contrastingly ethereal piece reflecting in its scoring for muted strings the rarefied atmosphere of the nunnery and, with the entry of an ancient Basque canticle on woodwind, anticipating the death of Gracieuse. At the end of the second suite the Basque Rhapsody balances the ‚ÄúOverture on Basque Tunes‚Äù at the beginning of the first. But, while it too is constructed in episodes each with its own Basque tune, it conforms to her rhapsody type by beginning unhurriedly and gradually increasing in speed. The central highlight is another zortzico, this one introduced by piccolo and oboe over an ostinato rhythm on a traditional Basque drum. The exhilarating ending is based on the unofficial Basque anthem Gernikako arbola. Recordings The latest recording of these suites (2011) was by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra led by Juanjo Mena, for Chandos Records. There is a 1929 recording of excerpts with Piern√© himself conducting the Colonne Orchestra; it was reissued on CD in a compilation on Piern√©'s recordings by Malibran Records.

History=Founding The company was founded on June 15, 1870 as Dominick & Dickerman by William Gayer Dominick and Watson Bradley Dickerman. Dominick was born in Chicago, and moved to New York as a child. In 1869, at the age of 25, he purchased membership on the New York Stock Exchange. At the NYSE, Dominick met Connecticut-born Dickerman and they went into business forming a stock brokerage firm.The New York Times Obituary. \\"William Gary Dominick\\" The New York Times 1 September 1985: n. pag.

Print} Dominick & Dickerman opened its first branch in 1889 in Cincinnati, where the firm was one of only two exchange members. A year later, Dickerman left the firm when he was elected president of the New York Stock Exchange. He would serve as president from 1890 to 1892, then return to the firm. His cofounder, William Dominick, died in 1895 at the age of 50 to typhoid fever. Dickerman would retire in 1909, passing away at the age of 77 in 1923. Dominick & Dickerman changed its name in 1899 to Dominick & Dominick, adding several new partners including Milnor B. Dominick, Andrew V. Stout, J.A. Barnard, and Bernon S. Prentice. The firm was one of the original sources for closed-end funds, launching The Dominick fund, Inc in 1920 by selling 200,000 shares for a raise of $10 million. Despite the stock market crash in 1929, the fund survived and was listed in 1959 on the NYSE before it was merged with Putnam Fund in 1973.SEC \\"SEC NEWS DIGEST\\" www.sec.gov/news/digest/1974/dig100274.pdf SEC Docket, Vol 6, No. 8 3 October 1974 Expansion In 1936 Dominick & Dominick expanded through acquisition, merging with A. Iselin & Co., also one of Wall Street's oldest firms. Several months earlier the patriarch of the firm, Adrian Iselin, died at the age of 89. He had joined the firm, which his father Adrian Georg Iselin formed, as a 22-year-old in 1868. At the time of the merger, Dominick & Dominick had 13 partners, including Gayer G. Dominick (senior partner since 1926), Bayard Dominick, and Gardner Dominick Stout. It next picked up several partners from Iselin & Co., as well as Iselin Securities Corporation, which brought with it an office in Paris, and the Iselin Corporation of Canada with its office in Montreal. Because Dominick & Dominick already maintained a London office, the London office of Iselin Securities was closed.

The firm was content to just keep its doors opened and operate. Gayer Dominick had been with the firm since 1909 after graduating from Yale University. In 1935 he was elected a governor of the New York Stock Exchange and helped to hire the first paid president of the Exchange, at the behest of the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

August 19, 1961 Post-War expansion After World War II came to an end and following a brief economic recession as the United States reverted to a peacetime footing, the economy enjoyed a long period of growth. Dominick & Dominick benefited from the country's prosperity. Some of the firm's most notable transactions during the postwar years involved Yonkers, New York-based Alexander Smith Carpet Company and Canada's Great Plains Oil. In the late 1950s Dominick & Dominick was also part of a banking syndicate that managed the initial public offering (IPO) of stock issued by Arvida Corporation, which was formed in Florida in 1958 to sell the real estate holdings of Arthur Vining Davis. The IPO gained attention because of objections raised by the SEC to the way the managers had announced the stock sale before filing a registration statement with the SEC, a violation of the law. Dominick & Dominick ended registration as a partnership, reorganizing as a corporation in 1964. The 1960s also saw the firm spread its operation across the country, taking advantage of a bull market to build up a domestic retail brokerage business. In 1962 an office in Chicago was opened. Dominick & Dominick gained a major presence in New England in 1966 by acquiring the firm of Townsend, Dabney, Tyson. Not only did the firm pick up a large Boston office but another 15 offices throughout the Northeast.

While the infusion of capital was welcome, Dominick & Dominick still found itself in a difficult position and decided to exit the domestic retail brokerage business and to sell the bulk of its branch offices. The firm's chairman and chief executive, Peter M. Kennedy, explained to the New York Times that \\"a national retail structure is not right for a firm of our size.

The firm also became involved in the fixed income area, making corporate and municipal bonds, Eurobonds, and Treasury Notes available to its clients, and launched managed futures programs to participate in the global currency markets. The firm also did a healthy business providing clearing services to more than 100 National Association of Securities Dealers firms; its Dominick & Dominick Advisors unit provided investment and portfolio management services to high-net-worth investors and institutions in the United States, Europe, and Asia.{Dominick Branches Sold to Other Firms.\\" The New York Times 8 Aug. 1973} 21st century By the start of the new century, Dominick & Dominick was in decline and needed an infusion of partner capital.

October 6, 2003 Campbell joined Dominick & Dominick in 2003, bringing senior management from DLJ and Credit Suisse First Boston. The new management relocated the firm headquarters from lower Manhattan to Midtown Manhattan to an office on 52nd St. In addition, Campbell wasted little time in recruiting new advisors from Credit Suisse and other major financial firms. Dominick & Dominick's first branch office to open under Campbell's management was in the fall of 2004 when an operation in Miami was opened to focus on wealthy Central and South American residents. It was not an acquisition, as Dominick was absorbing the Miami office of Pennsylvania-based First Security Investments, which had been opened by another former DLJ employee, Alain O'Hayon, who stayed on to manage the office. Campbell was very familiar with the potential of a Miami operation, having built up an office in the city for DLJ from just two brokers to more than 70.On Wall Street.

He is most famous for being the author of An Universal Biographical and Historical Dictionary. Life Born in Devon, he was educated at Bristol for the nonconformist ministry. Becoming dissatisfied, he conformed to the Church of England around 1786, with his friend Samuel Badcock, and for some years kept an academy in Devon. Watkins moved to London soon after beginning to write, probably about 1794. He became editor of the Orthodox Churchman's Magazine. His latest preface is dated 30 May 1831. Works His first independent publication appeared in 1792, entitled An Essay towards the History of Bideford, 1792. Chapter x. consists of the depositions in a trial for witchcraft held at Exeter on 14 August 1682. The work was reprinted and published at Bideford in 1883. In 1796 appeared The Peeper: a collection of Essays, Moral, Biographical, and Literary (London, 1796; 2nd edit. London, 1811), dedicated to Hannah More. These were followed by a number of publications, some anonymous and some under his name. The most important of them was perhaps his Universal Biographical and Historical Dictionary, which appeared in 1800, London. It went through several editions, the last in 1827, and was translated into French, with additions, in 1803 by Jean Baptiste L'√âcuy (fr).

Carlisle United F.C. is an English football club formed in 1904 and based in Carlisle, Cumbria, where they play at Brunton Park. Carlisle is the smallest location, by population, to have had a resident top flight English football club since 1980.  Carlisle United is born  The club was formed on 17 May 1904 at Shaddongate United's Annual General MeetingTHE CARLISLE UNITED STORY Carlisle United FC when the club's members voted to change the club's name to Carlisle United. The newly formed club initially played at Milhome Bank and later at Devonshire Park, finally settling at their current home Brunton Park situated on Warwick Road. There is a myth that still persists to this day that the club was formed from the amalgamation of Shaddongate United and Carlisle Red Rose. Carlisle United actually defeated Carlisle Red Rose 3‚Äì0 in the 1905‚Äì06 FA Cup.  Early years  Carlisle were elected to the Football League Third Division North in 1928 replacing Durham City. They won their first game in the league, the side of Prout, Coulthard, Cook, Harrison, Ross, Pigg, Agar, Hutchison, McConnell, Ward and Watson beating Accrington Stanley 3‚Äì2. In 1949, the club had the distinction of being the first club to appoint Bill Shankly as their manager. Shankly later went on to manage Workington and then Grimsby Town before being appointed manager of Liverpool in 1959; over the next 15 years he would guide the club to numerous trophy successes. Ivor Broadis was appointed player manager after the end of the Second World War making him the youngest league club manager in history. Broadis then had the distinction of becoming the first manager to transfer himself when he moved to Sunderland. Broadis returned as an 18 times capped ex England international in mid-1950s to add to his playing career at Brunton Park. Carlisle were members of the Third Division North until 1958, and Fourth Division until they won their first promotion.  Golden era  Carlisle were promoted from the fourth division in 1962. They then won consecutive promotions in 1964 and 1965, and established themselves as a Second Division side. They were promoted to the First Division for the 1974‚Äì75 season. Carlisle won their first three fixtures of the top division campaign to top the English football pyramid, with the likes of Chris Balderstone (it was Balderstone's penalty that put Carlisle top) and Bobby Parker who both made at least 375 league appearances for Carlisle. However the success was short lived and they finished the season in bottom place and were relegated. Highlight victories include doing a double over Everton, and home victories over eventual champions Derby, and former titlists Chelsea, Ipswich, Arsenal, Burnley, Tottenham and Wolves. Carlisle also beat former champions Chelsea in the opening game of the season at Stamford Bridge.https://www.chelseafc.com/en/about-chelsea/history/stadium- history?pageTab=1960s%20and%2070s Chelsea's new East Stand was opened for the first time and the game featured on Match of the Day.https://sites.google.com/site/motdlistings/home/1974-75  Late 20th century  Another relegation followed in 1977 before returning to the Second Division in 1982 under Bob Stokoe. With players like Malcolm Poskett and Tommy Craig, they mounted a promotion challenge in the 1983‚Äì84 season but finished 7th after a late slump, and consecutive relegations followed in 1986 and 1987. The 1987‚Äì88 season saw Carlisle in the Fourth Division for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century. They finished second from bottom in the league, 19 points ahead of the relegated Newport County. They reached the FA Cup Third Round, where they lost to defending league champions and eventual FA Cup winners Liverpool. A playoff position was nearly achieved 1989‚Äì90 season, but a 5‚Äì2 defeat to Maidstone United on the final day of the season meant that Carlisle remained in the Fourth Division. The following season ended with the Cumbrians 20th in the final table and cost manager Clive Middlemass his job in March. He was succeeded by Aidan McCaffrey. 1991‚Äì92 was worse still. Carlisle finished bottom of the Fourth Division, but fortuitously, due to the demise of Aldershot combined with the Football League's plan to expand to 94 clubs, no relegation to the Football Conference took part that year. In the 1992 close season, Michael Knighton took Carlisle and within weeks had sacked manager Aidan McCaffrey following a terrible start to the new Division Three campaign. David McCreery, 35, was appointed player-manager and steered Carlisle to safety as they finished 18th in the final table. 1993‚Äì94 began with much promise with Michael Knighton announced his intention to deliver Premier League football to Carlisle by 2003. He re-organised the management team to appoint Mick Wadsworth as Director of Coaching, while David McCreery was given the role of Head Coach and 38-year-old goalkeeper Mervyn Day was named as Assistant Coach. This season was Carlisle's best in years, as the ¬£121,000 record signing of striker Dave Reeves in October saw them acquire a much- needed prolific goalscorer. They won 10 of their final 14 league games to secure the final playoff place in Division Three, though their promotion dream was ended by Wycombe Wanderers in the semi-finals. In 1994‚Äì95, Carlisle finally achieved their first major success in 13 years by lifting the Division Three title. David Reeves scored 25 league goals to help Carlisle achieve their long-awaited success which ended their eight-year ordeal in the league's basement division. They also reached the Autoglass Windscreens Trophy Final but missed out on the trophy after conceding a sudden death extra time goal against Birmingham City. The following season was a tough one for Carlisle. Mick Wadsworth's resignation as manager in December was a major blow to Carlisle, as was the mid-season sale of key players Paul Murray and Tony Gallimore. They finished the season clear of the relegation zone with more goals than 21st-placed York City, who had to replay a game against Brighton and Hove Albion which had been abandoned due to crowd trouble. But a 3‚Äì1 victory for York sent Carlisle down, just one season after they had won promotion to Division Two. In 1996‚Äì97, young players like Rory Delap, Matt Jansen and Lee Peacock were crucial as Carlisle bounced back from relegation to achieve promotion back to Division Two at the first time of asking. The promotion joy was accompanied by a penalty shoot-out triumph over Colchester United in the Auto Windscreens Trophy Final, in which Tony Caig pulled off some impressive goalkeeping heroics. Mervyn Day was sacked just six games into the 1997‚Äì98, and chairman Michael Knighton promptly installed himself as manager. They were still in the relegation zone come Christmas, they did manage to climb clear. But nine defeats from their final 10 games condemned Carlisle to relegation in 23rd place, with 17 goals from striker Ian Stevens not being quite enough to attain survival. Carlisle entered the final game of the 1998‚Äì99 season needing to beat Plymouth Argyle at Brunton Park to avoid relegation and possibly extinction, and the score was still 1‚Äì1 at full-time. The referee allowed four minutes of stoppage time and during the final minute Carlisle were awarded a corner. Goalkeeper Jimmy Glass, signed in an emergency loan deal after the transfer deadline, drove home a last-gasp winner which preserved Carlisle's Football League status and sent down Scarborough.  21st century  Once again, Carlisle narrowly avoided relegation in 1999‚Äì2000, finishing in second from bottom place in Division Three. They lost their final game of the season 1‚Äì0 to Brighton and Hove Albion, but were kept up by Chester City's defeat at the hands of Peterborough United. 2000‚Äì01 saw Ian Atkins appointed at the Carlisle helm and there was much hope that he could be the man to achieve promotion. But things didn't work out, and they finished 22nd. Atkins quit at the end of the season and was succeeded by Roddy Collins. In 2001‚Äì02 Carlisle attained a safe final position of 17th ‚Äì which saw them finish 16 points clear of the relegation zone. For the fourth time in five seasons, Carlisle narrowly avoided relegation in 2002‚Äì03. This time, 22nd place was just one place above the drop zone, as this was the first season in which two clubs were relegated to the Conference instead of just one. Carlisle lost 18 of their first 21 Division Three games of the 2003‚Äì04 season. Paul Simpson's side picked up 40 points from a possible 75 but were still relegated; had they performed as well during the first half of the campaign as they did during the second, then they would have featured in the promotion push. Carlisle United thus became the first club to compete in all top five tiers of the English football league system (Oxford United, Luton Town, Grimsby Town and Leyton Orient have since followed). In 2004‚Äì05, Carlisle returned to the Football League at the first time of asking by winning the Conference National promotion playoffs. Carlisle's excellent form under Paul Simpson continued into the following season as they returned to the Football League with a bang, clinching the League Two title. Simpson then departed for Preston North End, and was succeeded by Neil McDonald. In 2006‚Äì07, Carlisle become the first visiting team to win a League One match at the Keepmoat Stadium, the new home of Doncaster Rovers, after a 2‚Äì1 win on 3 February 2007. The win was part of a sequence of games in which the club staged a late run for a play-off place; they finished the season in 8th place, their highest league finish for 22 years. Average league crowds were the highest for 30 years. Neil McDonald was sacked one game into the 2007‚Äì08 season. Greg Abbott took over as caretaker manager with Cheltenham Town manager John Ward taking over on a permanent basis in October 2007. Ward's contract will run for four years. Ward took Carlisle to the top of League One on 28 October, and they still looked likely for automatic promotion at the beginning of April, but could only finish fourth. On 12 May 2007, Carlisle United played Leeds United in the League One Playoff first leg at Elland Road. Carlisle won that match 2‚Äì1 with Graham and Marc Bridge-Wilkinson scoring the goals. Dougie Freedman scored a controversial injury time goal in the 96th minute for Leeds to set up a second leg. In the corresponding fixture at Brunton Park, Leeds took an early first-half lead through a Jonny Howson goal, and Howson then scored a second with only seconds to spare to put the match at 3‚Äì2 on aggregate to Leeds, meaning Carlisle would spend another season in the third tier of English football. The 2008‚Äì09 season began with the sale of two key players for a combined total of ¬£1.5 million. On 18 June 2008, Keiren Westwood left for Coventry City, for an initial ¬£500,000, while Joe Garner left for Nottingham Forest for ¬£1.14 million, triggering a clause that made Carlisle sell him. On 3 July, a consortium of local businessmen, led by director and accountant David Allen completed a takeover of the club from Fred Story. Carlisle's start to the season was one of their best, maintaining an unbeaten run in the league throughout August. However, this was followed by one of the poorest runs in form of recent Carlisle United history. On 3 November, Carlisle announced that they had parted with John Ward \\"by mutual consent\\", and Greg Abbott became the caretaker manager of the club. Greg Abbott was announced as the permanent manager of Carlisle, after his performance in a 6-game stint as temporary manager and his low wage demands impressed the board enough to appoint him. Carlisle secured their place in League One after beating Millwall 2‚Äì0 on 2 May and Northampton Town were relegated to League Two. In November 2009, the Blues reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time in nine years, after a 3‚Äì1 win over Norwich City in a foggy evening fixture at Brunton Park, before losing 3‚Äì1 to Everton on 3 January 2010 in the third round at Goodison Park. On 9 February 2010, Carlisle defeated Leeds United in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy Northern Final, winning 6‚Äì5 on penalties after the match finished 4‚Äì4 on aggregate over two legs, with Leeds winning the second leg 2‚Äì3 at Brunton Park. Carlisle thus became the first club to reach the final of this competition five times. On 28 March 2010, Carlisle played Southampton at the new Wembley Stadium in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy Final, where they succumbed to a 4‚Äì1 defeat in front of 73,746 fans. There was however some consolation when substitute Gary Madine grabbed a goal in the 84th minute with a fine header. Carlisle began the 2010‚Äì11 season strongly, with new acquisitions James Berrett, Frank Simek and the popular Francois Zoko boosting a team who had lost their star defender, ex-Leeds United full-back Ian Harte to Reading. Centre forward Gary Madine had begun to prove his worth, immediately forming a strong partnership with Zoko. However, the honeymoon period was not to continue and several slumps in form saw the club drop to within just four points of the relegation zone. Their luck was to change, with strong runs in the Johnsons Paint Trophy and the return of captain Paul Thirwell boosting a Carlisle team lacking in penetration. In April 2011, Carlisle won the 2011 Football League Trophy after a 1‚Äì0 win against Brentford. References Category:Carlisle United F.C.

John Grundy, Sr. (c.1696 ‚Äì 1748) was a teacher of mathematics, a land surveyor, and later a civil engineer. Grundy lived in Congerstone, Leicestershire, England for the first forty years of his life; he later moved to Spalding in Lincolnshire. He was one of the first engineers to apply mathematical principles to the problems of land drainage. His son, John Grundy Jr., was also a civil engineer. Life history John Grundy was the son of Benjamin and Mary Grundy. He was born in the village of Bilstone, probably in 1696, but resided in the nearby village of Congerstone for most of his early life. He married Elizabeth Dalton some time before 1719, for their first son, John Grundy Jr., was baptised in the church at Congerstone on 1 July of that year. He became well known as a land surveyor, and taught mathematics to private pupils, advertising his skills in Market Bosworth, Derby and Leicester. He visited Spalding in 1731, to do some surveying for the Duke of Buccleuch, where he noticed the work being undertaken by John Perry on the River Welland. He became convinced that \\"mathematical and philosophical principles\\" could be applied to the proper drainage of low-lying ground. He joined the Gentlemen's Society at Spalding in 1731, and presented them with a map of Spalding in 1732. Over the next six years, he made several trips to the Spalding area and Deeping Fen to work on drainage projects; he moved his family to Spalding in 1738. He had trained his son well, for he undertook his first project at Pinchbeck sluice in 1739, and the two of them worked jointly on a survey of the River Witham from Lincoln to Boston, and plans for drainage of the fens bordering the river. He died at the age of 52, on 30 December 1748 at Spalding, but was buried in Congerstone. His son, who went on to become one of the leading English civil engineers of the eighteenth century, erected a memorial in the church building. > In memory of John Grundy, late of Spalding, in Lincolnshire, who without the > advantage of a liberal education had gained by his industry a competent > knowledge in several of the learned sciences and lived by all ingenious > honest men deservedly beloved and died by all such truly regretted. Surveying Grundy used a number of devices to enable him to carry out surveys, including a theodolite, a circumferentor, Beighton's improved plane table, and a Gunter's chain. When he undertook work for the Duke of Baccleugh in 1731, surveying his south Lincolnshire estates, he used the opportunity to study banks, drains, sluices and outfalls. The contract lasted for six months, and it was during this time that his ideas about applying mathematical principles developed. In 1733, he worked for the Commissioners of Sewers, surveying the parish of Moulton, near Spalding, and suggesting ways in which its drainage could be improved. To assist him, he obtained a spirit level with telescopic sights from Jonathan Sisson, who was the best instrument maker at the time. With it, he was able to achieve an accuracy better than 1 inch per mile (15 mm per km). He demonstrated its use to Henry Beighton, a Fellow of the Royal Society, in 1734, who was convinced that Grundy's methods for obtaining such accuracy were correct. Drainage By 1734, Grundy had done enough research to publish a paper on the problem of flow in an open channel. He considered the movement of a single drop of water along a drain which was long, and dropped over that distance. Treating it in a similar way to free fall on an inclined plane, he calculated that the drop would take 1 hour and 28 minutes to cover the distance, and would thus travel at about per second. He understood that this calculation ignored the effect of fluid friction, and used field observations to show that the actual speed was less than half of his theoretical value. He also tackled the science of flow through a sluice, and insisted that draining of fenland could only be achieved by accurate mapping, correct determination of levels, and detailed observations on the ground. His conclusions met with the approval of John Theophilus Desaguliers, another Fellow of the Royal Society, who advocated the application of science to engineering problems, and who wrote papers on Experimental Philosophy. In 1735, Grundy went to see the River Dee, where Nathaniel Kinderley was working on a new ship canal through Chester. Although he thought that there were some aspects which could be better, he was upset by a paper published by Thomas Badeslade, which was extremely critical of it, and also of the work he was doing at Deeping Fen. A series of published exchanges took place in early 1736. Grundy took the view that making channels narrow and deep was important, since it increased the speed at which the water moved, and therefore its scouring action. Baseslade advocated allowing the maximum volume of water to move up and down a tidal river, and therefore opposed sluices, new cuts and the enclosing of salt marshes. Although the debate continued long after Grundy's death, he again pioneered the use of scientific principles, using works such as Castelli's Mensuration of Running Water to support his case. Projects Following his work for the Duke of Baccleuch, he was asked to survey the parish of Moulton in 1733. The request came from the Commissioners of Sewers, and the survey was to include plans for improving the drainage of the parish lands. It is unclear whether the plans were implemented, but in the following year, he was surveying of fenland to the west of Spalding, at the request of the Adventurers of Deeping Fen. He produced a map of of the River Welland, and proposed the construction of a reservoir and sluice at the junction of the River Glen and the Welland, which would be used to scour the river below that point. The following year, he surveyed Vernatt's Drain, the main drainage channel of Deeping Fen. No action was taken immediately, but in 1737, the Adventurers decided to proceed. Working with Humphrey Smith, Grundy revised his proposals somewhat, and they formed the basis for an enabling Act of Parliament obtained in 1737. Although Grundy initially worked under Smith, soon both men were directing separate parts of the works. By 1742, the project was completed. The Deeping Bank flood bank had been repaired, the Welland and Glen had both been regraded, the banks of the Glen had been raised, a reservoir covering and a sluice had been built at the mouth of the Glen to allow the channel to be scoured, the banks of the Glen had been raised and two drainage mills with scoop wheels had been constructed, one on Vernatt's Drain and the other on Hill's Drain. Grundy continued to work on the Welland until 1746, making the channel through Spalding deeper and wider in 1744 and 1745, and carrying out other routine improvements, costing about ¬£1,200 per year. He proposed that the outfall from Vernatt's Drain should be moved towards the sea, and although he did not see this actioned during his lifetime, his proposals were eventually implemented in 1774. During this period, he also made a survey of the River Witham, working with his son, and proposed a cut to improve navigation and flow on the river, but again did not see it implemented. In this case, the cost of ¬£16,200 was too high, but the work was carried out in the 1760s.

He was known for his crime novels, which have been classified in the noir genre. He won the Fawcett Gold Medal Paperback Award for his third novel, Black Wings Has My Angel, which has been reprinted in three editions since the original. He was also known for essays, published in popular magazines such as Life and Redbook. Chaze served in the military during World War II, and in the Occupation of Japan. He became a journalist, working in New Orleans and Denver before settling in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. There he wrote as a reporter and columnist for the Hattiesburg American beginning in 1951. He also served from 1970 to 1980 as its City Editor.  Biography = Early years  Elliott Chaze (the name he used as an adult) was born to Lewis and Sue Chaze in Mamou, Louisiana. Evangeline Parish had a strong tradition of French and Acadian influence. In 1932, Chaze graduated from Bolton High School in Alexandria, Louisiana. He attended Tulane University, Washington and Lee University, and graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1937. Chaze began his journalism career as a reporter for the New Orleans Bureau of the Associated Press. During World War II, he trained as a paratrooper and technical sergeant in the 11th Airborne Division of the U.S. Army. The war ended before he completed his training. After hostilities ended, Chaze continued to serve for a time, stationed in the Occupation of Japan. He married Mary Vincent Armstrong, with whom he had five children.  Journalist  After the war, Chaze rejoined the Associated Press (AP) in New Orleans, then transferred to the AP's Denver, Colorado bureau. In 1951, Chaze returned to the South, settling in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where he worked as a reporter and a columnist for the Hattiesburg American newspaper. While at the Hattiesburg American, Chase received the Hal Boyle Memorial Award for the best personal newspaper column, for his On the Lopside, which was printed in several newspapers. He was promoted to City Editor of the Hattiesburg American in 1970, and he served in that position through 1980. Chaze also wrote articles, humorous essays, and short stories, which he published in popular magazines of the time, including Collier's, Cosmopolitan, Life, Reader's Digest, Redbook, as well as the more literary The New Yorker. His Two Roofs and a Snake on the Door (1963), a collection of humorous essays, is considered by Marshall Keys to contain some of his best writing, in which Keys finds the \\"quintessential expressive detail.\\" Many of the essays were first published in Life, where Chaze was a regular contributor in the early 1960s.  Novelist  Chaze's works of fiction drew from many of his own experiences. They were praised by reviewers as being authentic and filled with local color, but sometimes criticized for sensationalism. The Stainless Steel Kimono, published in 1947, was Chaze's first novel, inspired by his time in Japan during the occupation. It is about the lives of seven American paratroopers while stationed in Japan. His most controversial novel, Tiger in the Honeysuckle (1965), was set within the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s in a fictionalized Hattiesburg. Exploring a white Southern newspaperman immersed in the changing times, it was harshly criticized by the New York Times and the Herald Tribune, but Granville Hicks of the Saturday Review wrote that it was \\"a sound piece of journalistic fiction, both informative and exciting.\\" He said that readers would likely respond based on their own positions on \\"the race question, not by anything inherent in the novel.\\" In an interview regarding his motivation for writing fiction, Chaze said: \\"Primarily I have a simple desire to shine my ass‚Äîto show off a bit in print.\\" During his career, Chaze had at least ten books published, including a collection of essays. His work was rediscovered in the 1980s, when Black Wings Has My Angel was republished One for the Money, and four more crime novels were published for the first time. The novels, and years of publication, were as follows: *The Stainless Steel Kimono (1947) *The Golden Tag (1950) :Republished as: Love on the Rocks (1956) *Black Wings Has My Angel (1953) :Republished as: One for My Money (1962), One for the Money (1985) *Tiger in the Honeysuckle (1965) *Wettermark (1969) *Goodbye Goliath (1983) *Mr. Yesterday (1984) *Little David (1985) *The Catherine Murders (Connoisseur Crime) (1986) Adaptations The rights to Black Wings Has My Angel were purchased in the early 21st century, and casting of major roles took place.

Born in Kingston upon Hull, Dawson went with his parents to Nottingham when he was still an infant and always regarded the latter as his native town. His parents were poor, and he began life in a Nottingham lace factory. But even while engaged in lace-making he continued to find time for art, and used to paint small pictures, which he sold at first for about half- a-crown each. In 1835 he gave up the lace trade and set up as an artist, his earliest patron being a hairdresser in Nottingham, who possessed a taste for art. In 1844 he removed to Liverpool, where after a time he got into greater repute, and received higher prices for his works. In 1849 he came with his family to London, and settled at Croydon, where some of his best pictures were painted. Among these may be reckoned 'The Wooden Walls of Old England,' exhibited at the British Institution in 1853, 'The Rainbow,' 'The Rainbow at Sea,' 'London Bridge,' and ' London at Sunrise.' With the exception of six lessons from Pyne received in 1838, Henry Dawson was entirely a self-taught artist, and his art shows much originality and careful realism. He studied nature for himself, but he seems in later life to have been moved by Turner's influence to try more brilliant effects than he had before dared. Many of his works indeed are very Turneresque in treatment, though he can scarcely be called an imitator of Turner, for he had a distinct style of his own. Henry Dawson, though painting much, and selling his pictures for high prices in his later life, remained, strange to say, very little known except to artists and connoisseurs until the large and very interesting collection of his works that was made for the Nottingham Exhibition in 1878 brought him wider fame. This exhibition showed him to be a genuine English landscape painter, of no great imaginative or intellectual power, but who delighted in nature, and represented her faithfully to the best of his ability. He died in December 1878, at Chiswick, where he had for some time resided.

Creation Made in a tall, thin, vertical drum or 'freezing unit' with an auger running axially in the centre. A water level is set in the bottom of the drum by gravity and as ice crystals begin to form, the auger carries them up the drum where they are compressed and further frozen until they are ejected from the top as 'flakes'. By changing the geometry of the auger and introducing 'ice breakers' into the ejection arrangement, the size and appearance of the ice can be changed to suit different applications. Storage As the ice is made at -0.5degC, it can be stored for prolonged periods in ambient conditions and all it will ever do is melt. However this means that the ice does contain more free water than colder types, therefore it is not suitable for storage in freezers below zero. Usage The medium size is widely used by fishmongers and supermarkets for fish display, so is probably the type of 'flake ice' that the average person is likely to have seen. Due to its properties of rapid cooling/melting, the small size of granular ice is used widely by the process industries, particularly food manufacture for cooling products made in mixers or bowl choppers such as dough or sausage meat, here it is mostly known as \\"fine ice\\" or \\"micro ice\\". It is also used in laboratories where it is often referred to as \\"crushed ice\\". The large size is most commonly used on board trawlers and for field cooling/packing of vegetables such as asparagus and broccoli. This is variously referred to as \\"flake ice\\", \\"large ice\\" and \\"macro ice\\".

It displays changing exhibitions of contemporary art, but has no permanent collection.  History  The building dates from the 19th century, originally having been built as a public prison. Following a request for a new prison, the Ministry allowed the construction of the building, on May 16, 1861. This project was carried out by the architect Jos√© Mar√≠a Ortiz y S√°nchez. The building, which was supposed to be a simple jail but eventually became a courthouse with courts, prisons and a small shelter for the guards, was completed in 1880. A century later, the city council considered demolishing the building to create a leafy square in its place, but after a strong rejection of this new project by the architect Alvaro Siza Vieira and Javier Sainz de Oinza and the History Professor From Madrid High School, Pedro Navascu√©s Palacio, this idea was abandoned. On 6 October 1990, the Directorate General of Heritage of the Galician regional government declared the building as a Cultural Property. In 1995, a new cultural project with the objective of rehabilitating the building and transforming it into a contemporary art museum was approved. The work was commissioned to a team of architects formed by Salvador Fraga Rivas, Francisco Javier Garc√≠a-Quijada Romero y Manuel Portol√©s Sanju√°n.

(2007). Integrating complementary and alternative medicine instruction into health professions education: organizational and instructional strategies. Academic Medicine, 82(10), 939-45. . This program is focused on training students to objectively assess the safety and efficacy of various CAM modalities such as acupuncture, massage, herbs and supplements, and mind-body interactions and introducing scientific rigor to much needed research in this field. History In Fall 2003, Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) introduced the first CAM-oriented, science-based Master of Science program at a US Medical Center. In 2010, over 90% of the 2004 graduates had started their residency programs or were in the process of completing their medical school.Amri, H., & Haramati, A. (2010). Using basic science to develop an innovative program in complementary and alternative medicine. Journal of the International Association of Medical Science Educators, 20(2), 48-55. . In Fall 2005, the Georgetown University School of Medicine (GUSOM) launched a 5-year MD/MS track, with the CAM MS course of study followed by the 4-year medical curriculum. The program was the first toAmri, H., & Haramati, A. (2010). implement the national initiative to integrate the critical scientific evaluation of CAM with medical education. Philosophy and Mission The American public's use of CAM therapeutic modalities, herbal medicines, and supplements has grown exponentially.Barnes, P.M., Bloom, B., & Nahin, R.L. (2008). Complementary and alternative medicine use among adults and children: United States, 2007. National Health Statistics Reports; no. 12. Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics.Nahin, R.L., Barnes, P.M., Stussman, B.J., & Bloom, B. (2009). Costs of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and frequency of visits to CAM practitioners: United States, 2007. National Health Statistics Report; no. 18. Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics. Georgetown University Medical Center recognizes the need to train a new generation of healthcare providers that has a grasp of what is called \\"integrative medicine\\" (medicine that incorporates beneficial evidence-based practices from CAM as well as mainstream medicine). The faculty of Georgetown University School of Medicine has made this institution one of the leaders in this field, by incorporating CAM into the education of medical students and into the graduate research programs. Physiology is the study of integrated function of the body, and trained physiologists are uniquely able to address, in their research and teaching, issues of biological and health- related effects of new or previously uninvestigated agents or treatments. The Complementary and Alternative Medicine Graduate Program is based on three pillars: an academically rigorous program that emphasizes the science of physiology, an innovative curriculum that offers students a broad insight into CAM disciplines and philosophies, and the skill to assess the evidence base that currently exists for various treatments and modalities. The program emphasizes critical thinking and a wide array of methods for scientific inquiry. The coursework also addresses legal, regulatory, and ethical issues involving CAM modalities. The mission of this program is to educate open- minded health care providers and scientists eager to explore the state of the evidence in areas of complementary and integrative medicine with objectivity and rigor. The goal is to train students who will enter careers in the private and public sectors related to CAM research, education, and integrative healthcare, and provide them with a rigorous educational program that incorporates a firm foundation in biomedical science, exposure to CAM disciplines, and competence in assessment of evidence. A select number of the graduates go on to complete a doctorate and pursue research, while others may apply their education in CAM to pursue further training for a career as healthcare providers; and still others may have been previously trained as practitioners (physicians, nurse practitioners, acupuncturists, nutritionists, pharmacists, etc.), and wish to return to their careers with their additional perspective and education in evidence-based medicine. Curriculum With the public interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM),Nahin, R.L., Barnes, P.M., Stussman, B.J., & Bloom, B. (2009). Georgetown University Medical Center anticipated the need for scientists and physicians trained to understand the basic principles of both Western biomedicine and CAM modalities, and the need for CAM professionals to be better grounded in basic biomedical sciences. This graduate program is designed to meet those needs. At the core of the program is an academically rigorous graduate education in CAM within the context of state of the art biomedical science. The program is designed to be completed in one year: two semesters and a summer session. In addition to the traditional basic science disciplines such as Biochemistry and Metabolism, Fundamentals of Physiology, and Biostatistics, the curriculum includes CAM-related courses such as Survey of CAM, CAM in Pathophysiological States, Mind-body Medicine Skills, Physiologic Basis of Mind-body Medicine, Critical Readings in CAM, as well as a number of diverse electives including Legal Aspects of CAM, Bioethics and CAM, and Western Practice of Eastern Medicine. In order to emphasize the cross-disciplinary application of academic knowledge and develop real-time problem-solving skills, the students complete an eight-week summer practicum in a relevant professional CAM-related environment or public health field. Faculty The Georgetown University Medical Center's Complementary and Alternative Medicine program was launched by faculty in the Departments of Physiology and Biochemistry. The multi- disciplinary expertise of the faculty in the basic sciences, in healthcare, and in CAM is broad and includes a number of nationally known leaders in the field. The program includes additional faculty members from clinical departments and guest lecturers with exceptional skills and expertise who participate in the teaching of CAM graduate students and further contribute to the strength and uniqueness of the program.

The newspaper is distributed free of charge on campus and to subscribers for a cost. The Dickinsonian is funded by the College and revenues from advertising and subscriptions. History Originally published by Dickinson's two literary societies, Union Philosophical Society and Belles Lettres Society in 1872, the paper was issued monthly. At this time, the newspaper functioned as more of a literary magazine \\"for the purpose of advancing the interests of the institution; and uniting more closely the Alumni to their Alma Mater; and promoting Science, Art, Literature and Religion.\\" Operated by faculty, students, and administrators, The Dickinsonian was responsible for bringing speakers like Walt Whitman to the campus. However, towards the end of the 1800s, students desired that The Dickinsonian print more campus news than literary work. Students independent from Union Philosophical Society, Belles Lettres Society, and the College administration began publishing The Dickinsonian while the literary societies continued to publish their paper as The Dickinsonian Literary Monthly for some time afterwards. By 1925, the newspaper established itself as a reliable source of campus news.

It offers a wide variety of yoga and meditation tools, including a line of eco-friendly gear and made in USA products.  History  In 1986, Sara Chambers founded Hugger Mugger Yoga Products in Salt Lake City, Utah. Chambers was a custom furniture builder and a student of the Iyengar Yoga teachers Cita Mason and David Riley in that city. During a workshop with the late Mary Dunn, Chambers observed the teacher using a belt to demonstrate a modification to a pose. This inspired her to create a 1-1/2-inch-wide cotton D-ring strap, and she began making more Iyengar-inspired yoga props in the basement of her home. She consulted with her local teachers and Dunn to help her come up with products, including handmade yoga bricks to B. K. S. Iyengar's specifications. She named her company Hugger Mugger after the thigh-hugging yoga shorts she was sewing. (Hugger Mugger means \\"to conceal.\\") These maroon, velour shorts stayed in place during inversions and wide-legged poses with the addition of an elastic band around the thighs. Chambers began importing and selling a makeshift yoga mat, cut from European carpet underlay. When she heard that this material would crumble after a few months, she decided to develop the Tapas Mat, the first mat designed specifically for yoga. Hugger Mugger moved into a warehouse space in 1989, as the company began to outgrow her basement. To help continue expanding the business, Chambers took on a partner, David Chamberlain, in 1997.

Rhodesian propaganda efforts targeting Britain often used such symbolism to stress Rhodesia's contribution on Britain's side during the two World Wars, and accuse the British government of betrayal. During the Rhodesian Bush War, informational and political warfare was mounted by each of the involved factions: on one side, the Rhodesian government (led by Prime Minister Ian Smith of the Rhodesian Front); on another, the British government and the Commonwealth of Nations; on a third, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and its associated guerrilla army, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA); and, on a fourth, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and its armed wing, the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). Beginning in 1965, the Rhodesian government implemented a coordinated strategic information and public diplomacy campaign, which included propaganda, censorship, and psychological operations, aiming to maintain the support of the country's black majority in the face of infiltration and indoctrination of ZANLA and ZIPRA, as well as to appeal to the common British populace, which the Rhodesians hoped would begin to question British government policy regarding Rhodesia.  Information operations = Rhodesian propaganda efforts in the West The Rhodesian government initiated white propaganda efforts‚Äîthat is, propaganda which truthfully states its origin‚Äîin October 1965, with the publishing and dissemination of a pamphlet titled Rhodesia's Case for Independence, which was distributed within Rhodesia and exported to Britain.

Brent Bozell Jr..Horne, Gerald From the Barrel of a Gun: The United States and the War Against Zimbabwe, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001 p.102 Typical of the group's propaganda was a column by Burnham where he declared that what African nationalists want is \\"to destroy the power and privileges of the white men; to take over their property, or most of it; and to permit white men to remain only as servants and handmaids\\", causing him to declare his support for the state of Katanga, which was ruled by Mo√Øse Tshombe and covertly supported by Belgium.Brownell, Josiah \\"Diplomatic Lepers: The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\\" from The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 47, No. 2, Spring 2014 p.215. The battle-lines formed by the issue of whatever the United States should recognize Katanga repeated themselves with regard to Rhodesia with the same people who championed Katanga championing Rhodesia while the people opposed to Katanga as a 'sham' were also vehmenently opposed to Rhodesia.Brownell, Josiah \\"Diplomatic Lepers: The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\\" from The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 47, No. 2, Spring 2014 p.210. In 1966, the ACAKFF was reborn as the American African Association (AAAA) with both groups having Yergan as president or co- president, virtually identical letter-heads, the same board of directors, the same mailing lists, and same address in New York, 79 Madison Avenue, which was also the headquarters of Marvin Liebman Associates.Brownell, Josiah \\"Diplomatic Lepers: The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\\" from The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 47, No. 2, Spring 2014 p.231. At the same time it was revealed that the public relations firm of Marvin Liebman Associates had been hired by the Information Office of the Rhodesian government to try to improve Rhodesia's image in America.Brownell, Josiah \\"Diplomatic Lepers: The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\\" from The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 47, No. 2, Spring 2014 p.231-232. Even more extreme were groups such as the American Friends of Rhodesia founded by the far-right Liberty Lobby and John Birch Society which engaged in wildly racist propaganda that Kenneth Towsey, the head of the Information Office in New York thought did more harm than good.Brownell, Josiah \\"Diplomatic Lepers: The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\\" from The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 47, No. 2, Spring 2014 p.232. About groups such as the American Friends of Rhodesia, Towsey in a 1966 letter: \\"We have considered prudent to sup with them with a long spoon\\".Horne, Gerald From the Barrel of a Gun: The United States and the War Against Zimbabwe, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001 p.103 In June 1966, the Rhodesian Ministry of Information published a pamphlet Rhodesia in the Context of Africa saying: \\"The hopes and expectations of the [African] masses been dashed in tragedy after tragedy...One island of relative sanity remained in the richly endowed Katanga...But war was waged by the United Nations to destroy this secessionist or 'rebel' government....it is the fashion today to turn a blind eye on the Congo tragedy, and even to suggest that it is an exceptional case from which Europeans in Rhodesia should not draw unwarranted conclusions. Embarrassing though it may be, its lessons are there to be learned‚Äîby the world no less than Rhodesia\\".Brownell, Josiah \\"Diplomatic Lepers: The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\\" from The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 47, No. 2, Spring 2014 p.225. In Canada, the Friends of Rhodesia was founded by Gerald Hart and John Baldwin with a total membership of 200 people by 1966. Hart told Maclean's that he was not racist, but was for Rhodesia \\"because they are the same kind of people who helped build Canada. Why should they be driven out by a pack of savage aborigines just down from the trees? And no, I wouldn‚Äôt want my daughter to marry one. You‚Äôd bastardize both races.\\" In November 1966, the AAAA published an ad featuring a map of Africa in The New York Herald Tribune entitled \\"Sovereignty ... and Strife\\" listing all of the newly independent African nations which had experienced coups and civil wars in the last year, with the implication that to allow color-blind voting in Rhodesia would be to invite chaos.Brownell, Josiah \\"Diplomatic Lepers: The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\\" from The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 47, No. 2, Spring 2014 p.225. A pamphlet issued by the AAAA from 1966 declared: \\"Should Rhodesia fail, all of Africa will suffer...Chaos would inundate order, and Africa would not fail to read the message that Western Civilization has abdicated\\".Brownell, Josiah \\"Diplomatic Lepers: The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\\" from The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 47, No. 2, Spring 2014 p.215. Another pro-Rhodesian group was the American Southern African Council headed by Lake High, a Southern political activist well known for his support of segregation in his native South Carolina.Horne, Gerald From the Barrel of a Gun: The United States and the War Against Zimbabwe, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001 p.102 Much the Council's propaganda was blatantly racist such one article that featured in its magazine American Southern Africa Review in 1970 where it declared that how \\"Americans suffering under the ravages of such outrageous legislation such as the Civil Rights (forced housing) act of 1968 can only look enviously at the Rhodesians\\".Horne, Gerald From the Barrel of a Gun: The United States and the War Against Zimbabwe, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001 p.102 In 1968, the Council endorsed George Wallace for president because of his statements that if elected president he would recognize Rhodesia and use Rhodesia as a model for solving America's \\"Negro problem\\".Horne, Gerald From the Barrel of a Gun: The United States and the War Against Zimbabwe, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001 p.103  Media censorship  As the Rhodesian government prepared for their autonomy from Britain, it began to limit foreign communication. It began with a weekly radio broadcast prepared by the Ministry of Information, the content of which was \\"selective and slanted reporting attempted to build up a black picture of the independent African states to the north, combined with an image of Rhodesia, South Africa and the adjacent Portuguese territories as havens of good government and fair play.\\"British National Archives, Dominions Office ref: 207/220. \\"Rhodesia: The Regime's Propaganda Machine and its Operations.\\" Rhodesia Political Department, Commonwealth Relations Office; 16 March 1966. The Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation, a statutory body, was subjected to close Government control. By the end of 1964 Rhodesia Television, an independent commercial station, was taken over by the Government.  British response  When the British became aware of the propaganda being mailed to their citizens from Rhodesia, they began a counter-campaign. The Rhodesia Political Department of the British Commonwealth Relations Office wrote a paper titled \\"Rhodesia: The Regime's Propaganda Machine and its Operations.\\"British National Archives: Dominions Office ref: 207/220. \\"Rhodesia: The Regime's Propaganda Machine and its Operations.\\" Rhodesia Political Department, Commonwealth Relations Office; 16 March 1966. The paper outlined how in May 1964, even before their official declaration of independence, the Rhodesian Government appointed a South African propaganda specialist named Ivor Benson. Benson became a special adviser within the Ministry of Information and it was his task to develop an effective propaganda machine.SGM Herbert A. Friedman, PSYOP 1965‚Äì1980 Paragraph 41  Political warfare in the Bush War In early 1972 ZANLA, the military branch of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) led by Robert Mugabe and ZIPRA, the military branch of the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) led by Joshua Nkomo, rose up against Smith's minority government. ZANLA and ZIPRA forces began infiltrating Rhodesia, committing acts of murder and terrorism against farmers. The Rhodesian Front received intelligence that ZANLA fighters were operating out of the Chiweshe Tribal Trust Area. Tribal trust areas were large tracts of land prescribed by law to be used and occupied exclusively by the black population of the area. In response to the violence perpetuated by the ZANLA fighters in the Chiweshe Tribal Trust, the Rhodesian Front created protected villages. Smith's government attempted to relocate 45,000 people and their houses, belongings and livestock, but they were unable to mobilise.Rhodesian Army Association. \\"The Start of the Protected Village Program. Paragraph 4 and 10 Protected villages quickly proved insufficient, forcing people to live without access to food (stores and grinding mills were closed), clean water, or toilets. Shelter was limited and as the cold season arrived, people continuously died from exposure.SGM Herbert A. Friedman, PSYOP 1965‚Äì1980 Paragraph 29 The Smith government asserted that these conditions were forced by the violence of the ZANLA forces, and that the lack of adequate accommodations was simply caused by their inability to build the infrastructure quickly enough. ZANU and ZAPU announced a joint \\"Patriotic Front\\" and together began infiltrating Rhodesia, committing murder and acts of terrorism against Rhodesians, particularly in the protected villages, with many of the forces living in these protected village as a form of cover. ZANLA and ZIPRA violence escalated to include murder, rape, abduction, torture, beatings, robberies, and cattle-maimings.Rhodesia Ministry of Information, \\"Anatomy of Terror.\\" Government Printer (Salisbury): 1974. p. 2 This escalation in violence and subsequent civil war became known as the Rhodesian Bush War.  Restricted media  The Rhodesian government again employed tactics of censorship. Rhodesian cameras were banned from protected villages. At the same time, propaganda was being circulated to discourage Rhodesians from talking about conditions inside of the country. Brightly coloured stickers were distributed throughout the country and posted in restaurants and bars.SGM Herbert A. Friedman, PSYOP 1965‚Äì1980 Paragraph 67 They consisted of a series of slogans focused around self-censorship including: \\"Your Tongue Could Pull a Trigger. Think about national security, don't talk about it.\\" Others included \\"Women's Lib is One Thing, Women's Lip is Another,\\" \\"What You've Said May Blow Up a Truck,\\" and \\"An Open Mouth Makes a Big Target. Think about national security, don't talk about it.\\"SGM Herbert A. Friedman, PSYOP 1965‚Äì1980 Paragraph 67  Propaganda  In an effort to gain sympathy around the world, particularly the West, the Rhodesian Government published a series of booklets offering photographic evidence of the atrocities alleged to have been committed by Patriotic Front military forces. In March 1974, William F. Buckley Jr. traveled to Salisbury (modern Harare, Zimbabwe), where he interviewed Smith and expressed much sympathy for Rhodesia.Horne, Gerald From the Barrel of a Gun: The United States and the War Against Zimbabwe, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001 p.108 Later, he was to denounce President Jimmy Carter's human rights policies, writing about Carter's \\"hectic concern for human rights in Rhodesia, practically defined as the transfer of power from an orderly white community to a disorderly black community\\".Horne, Gerald From the Barrel of a Gun: The United States and the War Against Zimbabwe, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001 p.108 The American economist and academic Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago visited Rhodesia in 1976 on the invitation of the Information Office and upon his return to America stated he was \\"impressed by what I saw there\\".Horne, Gerald From the Barrel of a Gun: The United States and the War Against Zimbabwe, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001 p.110 Friedman added that victory for the Patriotic Front guerrillas \\"would be a great prize for the Russians\\" and the end of Rhodesia as a white-ruled state would be the \\"suicide of the West\\".Horne, Gerald From the Barrel of a Gun: The United States and the War Against Zimbabwe, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001 p.110  Massacre of the Innocents A pamphlet released by the Rhodesian Ministry of Information proclaims the strength of the security forces and the benefits of the protected villages. \\"Today, many thousands have taken grateful refuge in protected villages or live in communities protected by the security forces and the para-military wing of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\\"Rhodesia Ministry of Information, \\"Massacre of the Innocents\\" Government Printer (Salisbury): 1978. Paragraph 4 It states that the terrorists are scared of the government forces, and therefore are pursuing \\"soft targets\\". The piece goes on to reiterate criticism of the British government for not providing support. \\"Tragically, the villagers are dying in a war they do not want, waged to further a political creed they do not understand or care about.\\"Rhodesia Ministry of Information, \\"Massacre of the Innocents\\" Government Printer (Salisbury): 1978. Paragraph 3  Red for Danger  The Rhodesian Ministry of Information published a booklet titled \\"Red for Danger\\". Hundreds of thousands of copies were dispatched to many different countries and it ranked as a best seller.Rhodesian Ministry of Information, \\"Red for Danger.\\" Paragraph 1 It identifies ZANU and ZAPU political parties as cover organisations for Communist expansion and was an attempt to elicit the help of Western countries actively pursuing containment. The book drew parallels between the Chinese push for Communism in Vietnam, their success in other African countries, and their pursuit of the same goal in Rhodesia through monetary support and training of the ZANU terrorist forces. \\"The terrorists who have recently been shot or captured in Rhodesia were all thoroughly indoctrinated with the communist ideology. They carried the literature of Mao Tse Tung and more important, they were armed with modern automatic rifles and machine guns of communist manufacture as well as explosives, grenades and powerful bazookas. In fact, recent Australian visitors have been surprised to find that the weapons being used against Rhodesia are of the same pattern as those being used against Australians, New Zealanders and Americans in Vietnam.\\"Rhodesian Ministry of Information, \\"Red for Danger.\\" Paragraph 21 To make the case for Western involvement, the booklet continues: \\"Should Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola succumb to communist domination, the southern coast of Africa would follow and the lifeline between the Western powers and the Far East would be cut.\\"Rhodesian Ministry of Information, \\"Red for Danger.\\" Paragraph 23  Anatomy of Terror  Anatomy of Terror was a booklet published by the Rhodesian Ministry of Information and circulated by the Rhodesian information office in Washington, D.C. The booklet offers a short summary of the crimes perpetrated by \\"Communist-trained thugs\\"Rhodesia Ministry of Information, \\"Anatomy of Terror.\\" Government Printer (Salisbury): 1974. p. 2 followed by a \\"Chronological Sequence of Terror\\" which details brutal attacks committed against black Rhodesians from December 1972 to May 1974 and corresponding photographs.  Psychological operations = Propaganda: Operation Split- Shot  As the war progressed and the Rhodesian government's control diminished, the 1st Psychological Operations Unit of the RF implemented \\"Operation Split-Shot.\\" Leaflets were distributed to engender fear among the Rhodesian population. The campaign was focused around the theme of \\"Terror and death is the way of the communist terrorists in Rhodesia.\\"SGM Herbert A. Friedman, PSYOP 1965‚Äì1980 Paragraph Leaflets depicted ZANLA/ZIPRA recruiters forcing black Rhodesians into training camps, raping women in front of their children, spreading sexually transmitted diseases, and killing defenceless civilians. These leaflets also depicted military recruits being mistreated and killed by opposition forces. Propaganda efforts backfired when Rhodesians who voluntarily joined the opposition forces returned to their villages unharmed. According to senior members of the 1st Psychological Operations Unit, the unit was creating their propaganda based on false intelligence.SGM Herbert A. Friedman, PSYOP 1965‚Äì1980 Paragraph The Rhodesians began to realise that the information presented in the leaflets was false and therefore began to mistrust their government. As a final effort, PSYOP forces resorted to reporting messages from the spirits to gain credibility with rural tribes. \\"Mhondoro, your tribal spirit, has sent a message to say that your ancestral spirits are very dissatisfied with you. As a result of this, there has been no rain, your crops have died and there could be great famine. It is only the Government which can help you, but you have to realize your obligation to help the government also.\\"SGM Herbert A. Friedman, PSYOP 1965‚Äì1980 Paragraph Efforts were unsuccessful, as the source of the propaganda had already lost all credibility.

In their initial advance, the French began the Siege of Menin and captured Kortrijk (Courtrai). With Habsburg Austrian reinforcements, Clerfayt counterattacked on the 28th but Joseph Souham soon massed superior French forces and drove the Coalition troops out of the area. This Flanders Campaign action happened during the War of the First Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. The battle occurred near Mouscron, Belgium, located at the French border south of Kortrijk and at Menen, located west of Kortrijk. Because most of the Coalition army was covering the Siege of Landrecies, the early French advance was largely successful in driving back a weak screen of Hanoverian troops. On the north bank of the Lys River, a division under Jean Victor Marie Moreau besieged Menen, while Souham's division operated on the south bank. Clerfayt's foray enjoyed initial success at Mouscron, but Souham on his own initiative concentrated superior forces against the Coalition. Completely isolated by Clerfayt's defeat, the largely Hanoverian garrison of Menen under Rudolf von Hammerstein broke out of the fortress and escaped on the 30th. The next action occurred at the Battle of Courtrai on 10 May. Background For the 1794 Flanders Campaign, the French deployed 160,000 troops in the Army of the North and 35,000 in the Army of the Ardennes. Against them the Coalition used approximately 150,000 soldiers from Habsburg Austria, the Dutch Republic and various contingents paid for by the Kingdom of Great Britain. Coalition strategy called for their armies to exert pressure the north and northeastern frontiers of France in order to open a path to Paris. Jean-Charles Pichegru had control over the two French armies whose lines stretched from Dunkirk on the North Sea west through Lille, Douai and Cambrai to Maubeuge. Army of the Ardennes was posted on the right wing and the newest recruits were used to man the fortresses. The French enjoyed numerical superiority but the Coalition fielded troops of better quality. According to the plan drawn up by Minister of War Lazare Carnot, the French were to turn both Coalition flanks. The Coalition army was headed by Austrian Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld who was supported by British Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Both armies operated on the cordon system which required troops to guard the entire frontier.Dodge (2011), p. 120 With 85,000 soldiers, Coburg began the Siege of Landrecies to start the 1794 campaign. Pichegru made two relief attempts but both were repulsed. On 26 April one of the columns commanded by Ren√©-Bernard Chapuy was crushed at the Battle of Beaumont-en-Cambresis by the Duke of York. In this fiasco, the French suffered losses of 7,000 killed, wounded and missing, plus 40 guns and 50 ammunition wagons taken. When Chapuy was made prisoner his captors found Pichegru's plan of campaign on his person. This outlined the attack that was about to be carried out in Flanders. These Republican French failures led to the surrender of Landrecies on 30 April 1796. French losses in the siege amounted to 2,000 dead from enemy action or sickness and 5,000 captured.Smith (1998), p. 76 On 13 April 1794, Pichegru was at Lille to organize his attack. His army consisted of divisions led by Pierre Antoine Michaud at Dunkirk with 13,943 soldiers, Jean Victor Marie Moreau at Cassel with 15,968 troops, Joseph Souham at Lille with 31,865 men and Pierre-Jacques Osten at Pont-√†-Marcq with a 7,822-strong brigade. Pichegru assigned Moreau's brigade of Nicolas Joseph Desenfans to Souham. Moreau was assigned half of Michaud's division as compensation.Phipps (2011), p. 292 Austrian General Fran√ßois S√©bastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt with 28,000 troops was responsible for covering the Coalition right wing. On 23 April a French force advanced from Cambrai toward Denain, menacing Coalition troops led by Hessian General Ludwig von Wurmb. In response, Clerfayt was directed to move south from his base at Tournai toward Denain. Aware of the danger to Menen (Menin), Clerfayt was irritated by these orders from Austrian chief of staff Karl Mack von Leiberich.Phipps (2011), p. 293 Battle Battle of Mouscron, 29 April 1794, part of the Flanders Campaign On 25 April Pichegru started to advance on Menen and Kortrijk (Courtrai). Michaud spread out between Veurne (Furnes) and Roesbrugge but his role was small in this offensive. Moreau moved down the north bank of the Lys River and began firing his cannon on Menen on the 28th. Souham advanced on the south bank of the Lys. Spearheaded by Jacques MacDonald with 15,000 troops, Souham's division seized Kortrijk on 26 April. In this skirmish, the French forced 1,500 Coalition troops under Hanoverian General Georg Wilhelm von dem Bussche to abandon the city. The Hanoverians in Bussche's detachment included two squadrons of the 9th Bussche Light Dragoon Regiment, one company of the 14th Diepenbroick Light Infantry Regiment, 200 foot soldiers from various units and a half-battery of artillery. The French Royalist units were one battalion of the York Rangers and two squadrons of Uhlans Britannique. The Hanoverians suffered 42 men killed, wounded or captured, and lost one field gun. French Republican and Royalist losses are unknown. Joseph Souham Also on the 26th, elements of Souham's division bumped into a force under Hanoverian General George von Oeynhausen at Mouscron. This Hanoverian detachment consisted four battalions of the 1st Scheither and 4th Bussche Infantry Regiments, two J√§ger companies, two squadrons of the 7th Heavy Dragoon Regiment and five heavy guns. Oeynhausen moved east to Dottignies where his troops were able to hold their ground. Moreau and 14,000 soldiers invested Menen on 27 April. The 2,423-man Coalition garrison was commanded by Hanoverian General Rudolf von Hammerstein. The Hanoverian contingent was made up of one battalion of grenadiers, two battalions of the 14th Light Infantry Regiment, 62 horsemen from the 1st Leib Cavalry and 9th Light Dragoon Regiments and one foot artillery battery manned by 160 gunners. The remainder of the garrison consisted of 282 soldiers from the Hesse-Kassel Erbprinz Infantry Regiment, the French Royalist Loyal Emigrant Battalion and 17 Austrian gunners. Hammerstein's force had a total of 22 cannons and six howitzers. Once the Coalition came into possession of Pichegru's plans, Clerfayt was ordered to march his troops to the west. According to historian Ramsay Weston Phipps, Clerfayt attacked Mouscron on 28 April and drubbed Nicolas Bertin's brigade, the French retreating southwest to Tourcoing. Henri Antoine Jardon's brigade withdrew north to Aalbeke. Another authority, Digby Smith asserted that Oeynhausen recovered Mouscron on the 28th after having suffered 111 casualties. That evening, Oeynhausen was reinforced to a strength of 3,600 by four battalions of the 6th Hammerstein and 9th Saxe-Gotha Infantry Regiments and two squadrons each of the Leibgarde and 4th Bussche Cavalry Regiments. All these were Hanoverian units. Also that evening, Clerfayt arrived with an Austrian force of seven battalions, 10 squadrons and 12 12-pound cannons in addition to battalion pieces. There were two battalions each of the Szt√°ray Nr. 33 and Brentano Nr. 35 Infantry Regiments and two squadrons of the Blankenstein Hussar Regiment Nr. 16. The other units are not identified. Clerfayt commanded a total of about 10,000 troops. Phipps remarked about Pichegru that, \\"nothing is more remarkable than the manner in which he managed to be absent when his army fought\\".Phipps (2011), p. 284 On the 29th Pichegru was again unavailable. In the event, Souham acted with initiative, ordering Jacques MacDonald to march his brigade to Aalbeke and take command of Jardon's and Bertin's brigades, a total of 16,000 troops. When the brigade of Herman Willem Daendels arrived on the scene the total force numbered 24,000 men. As many as 28,000 French troops were engaged in battle on 29 April. Meanwhile, Clerfayt planned to relieve Menen on 30 April. While Souham's main force attacked frontally, Bertin's brigade turned Clerfayt's left. The Austrian general believed the battle was over and did not have his soldiers ready to defend themselves. Even so, the Coalition troops defeated Bertin again and twice repulsed the attacks of Daendels and MacDonald. At 2:00 PM Souham demanded another effort as he and MacDonald personally led the assault. French artillery superiority was decisive, despite a brief panic among the French troops. The badly outnumbered Austro-Hanoverians were eventually routed. They were saved from further losses when five battalions of reinforcements met their retreating columns at Dottignies. The corps continued its withdrawal to Espierres on the Scheldt River. Results The French Royalists in Menen were aware that they would be executed if captured. Therefore, on the night of 30 April the garrison of Menen broke out. Led by the Loyal Emigrant Battalion, Hammerstein's men cut their way out to the north. It was alleged that the escape was partly due to the carelessness of Moreau's brigade commander Dominique Vandamme. The garrison got away with most of their own artillery. The Hanoverians lost 38 killed, 123 wounded and 387 captured while the Royalists lost 92 killed and 87 wounded. Hessian and Austrian losses were not reported. The total loss was therefore 727 casualties and 10 artillery pieces. The garrison captured seven French guns but had to abandon five because they did not have enough horses to haul them. French losses were 500 men and two guns. One source stated that the Austrians lost 3,000 prisoners, 33 artillery pieces and four colors in the Battle of Mouscron. Another authority gave Austrian losses as 903 casualties and 11 field guns and Hanoverian losses as 58 killed, 272 wounded and 527 missing plus five colors, 13 artillery pieces and 16 munition wagons captured. The total reported loss was 1,760 men and 24 guns. The Szt√°ray Regiment was severely mauled, losing 11 officers and 400 rank and file. The French suffered about 1,500 casualties and lost six guns. After capturing Landrecies, the Coalition moved large forces into the area but they failed to concentrate them. They sent Clerfayt to the north side of Kortrijk, the Duke of York to Marquain near Tournai and other forces to the east of Kortrijk.Phipps (2011), p. 294 The Hanoverian cavalry was victorious in a clash at Roeselare on 4 May. For a loss of three killed and 27 wounded, they inflicted 102 casualties on the French and took three artillery pieces. The next day there was an indecisive skirmish at Harelbeke in which Hesse-Darmstadt troops sustained losses of three killed and 18 wounded.Smith (1998), p. 77 The next significant action was the Battle of Courtrai on 10‚Äì12 May 1794.Smith (1998), p. 78 Commentary Phipps called Souham's actions in the absence of his army commander on 29 April \\"praiseworthy\\". He also noted that Clerfayt should have waited for reinforcements before offering battle. J. Rickard gave Oeynhausen credit for saving the Coalition position on the 26th and for recovering Mouscron. The French admitted that Hammerstein's handling of the breakout was most \\"creditable\\". Bertin was soon replaced in command of his brigade by Philippe Joseph Malbrancq.

A co-evolutionary arms race is established between the sexes in which either sex evolves a set of antagonistic adaptations that is detrimental to the fitness of the other sex. The potential for reproductive success in one organism is strengthened while the fitness of the opposite sex is weakened. Interlocus sexual conflict can arise due to aspects of male‚Äìfemale interactions such as mating frequency, fertilization, relative parental effort, female remating behavior, and female reproductive rate. As the sexes demonstrate a significant investment discrepancy for reproduction, interlocus sexual conflict can arise. To achieve reproductive success, a species member will display reproductive characteristics that enhance their ability to reproduce, regardless of whether the fitness of their mate is negatively affected. Sperm production by males is substantially less biologically costly than egg production by females, and sperm are produced in much greater quantities. Consequently, males invest more energy into mating frequency, while females are choosier with mates and invest their energy into offspring quality. The evolutionary pathways resulting from interlocus sexual conflict form part of interlocus contest evolution, a theory describing the coevolution of different loci in a species through the process of intergenomic conflict. This has led to the proposal that sexual antagonistic coevolution is fueled by interlocus sexual conflict. Well-evidenced examples come exclusively from the insect world, with the majority of research being conducted in yellow dung flies, Scathophaga stercoraria, and fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. Examples outside of these taxa are theoretical, though currently not well studied. Interlocus sexual conflict differs from intralocus sexual conflict, a similar theory in which a set of antagonistic alleles resides on the same locus in both sexes.  Theory development = Models  The first model of interlocus sexual conflict, the genetic threshold model, was developed by Parker to explain sexual conflict among yellow dung flies. Further investigation of sexual conflict theory remained relatively untouched until Rice predicted that genes for sexually antagonistic traits exist at the same loci of the sex chromosomes in both sexes, which led to the development of intralocus sexual conflict. Rice‚Äôs genetic model of X-linkage influencing sexual dimorphism demonstrated that alleles for reproductive traits will persist if they increase the fitness of one sex, regardless of the associated cost for their mate. An expansion of Parker‚Äôs genetic threshold model was later used to examine how sex-linked harming alleles, or mutant alleles that cause males to harm females during reproduction, proliferate within a population and initiate interlocus sexual conflict. In a population of fruit flies where a Y-linked harming allele decreases the fitness of a female mate, an indirect cost is imposed on the male‚Äôs fitness. Consequently, the harming allele is only favored in circumstances where the difference between offspring sired by harming males and normal males is greater for harming males, or harming males are at a fitness advantage. The chase-away sexual selection model, proposed by Holland and Rice, enabled the prediction that mating discrimination by females will drive the evolution of male display features toward extreme phenotypes. As a result, an arms race develops where female mate choice drives male morphology. A model of antagonistic coevolution by Arnqvist and Rowe highlighted the example of abdominal spines in female water striders, Gerris incognitus, to demonstrate how this arms race leads to evolutionary adaptations in females. Female water striders achieve control over copulatory acts by using their spines as defense against aggressive males.  Interlocus contest evolution  Interlocus sexual conflict forms the basis for interlocus contest evolution (ICE), characterized by the coevolution of genes at different loci in a species through intergenomic conflict. In other words, a disequilibrium forms as alleles for reproductive traits are substituted at different loci in opposing sexes, resulting in rapid evolution of the trait at the locus, which further fuels an arms race between the sexes. The Red Queen hypothesis postulates that evolution of a trait in one species will drive antagonistic coevolution in an opposing species and can be used to explain coevolution in cases of predatory behaviour, host-parasite relationships, and sexual selection. Of interest to interlocus sexual conflict, the Red Queen hypothesis allows for the evolution of traits that enhance reproductive fitness. ICE extends from this hypothesis, proposing that antagonistic coevolution does not require opposing species, but can be applied to genes at different loci in a single species.  Versus intralocus sexual conflict  The genetic basis of the distinction between interlocus sexual conflict and intralocus sexual conflict is the location of the interacting antagonistic alleles. Conflict in which the antagonistic alleles are located at the same locus is termed intralocus sexual conflict. This occurs when males and females undergo different selective pressures at the same locus, resulting in either sex limiting the fitness of the other sex. Importantly, many examples of sexual conflict are not categorized into interlocus sexual conflict or intralocus sexual conflict, as the genetic locations of the interacting alleles for these traits are not known or specified. It is critical to note when interpreting information regarding sexual conflict that these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, despite this being incorrect.  Antagonistic coevolution  Sexual antagonistic coevolution is characterized by an arms race between the sexes in which one sex experiences changes in morphology or behaviour to compensate for the negative effects of the reproductive traits of the opposite sex. Both sexes strive to maintain an optimal fitness level, but do so at the expense of their mate's fitness. For interlocus sexual conflict to be a valid cause of antagonistic coevolution, the harm induced by the males across all loci has to outweigh the indirect benefits that the females gain by interacting with males. Copulation in Scathophaga stercoraria  In Scathophaga stercoraria  Through Parker‚Äôs genetic threshold model, it was discovered that female yellow dung flies can be injured in battles between male suitors. Males are selected to evolve traits for competitive ability that would increase their reproductive success, but females would evolve a set of antagonistic adaptations to reduce their chances of being injured during these interactions. Male yellow dung flies use pheromones, seminal fluid proteins (SPFs), and aggressive behaviour attributable to their size to manipulate females during courtship. As yellow dung flies are a polyandrous species, females obtain sperm from multiple males which is stored for fertilization. Larger males have a competitive advantage in displacing the sperm of other males, enhancing the likelihood of their sperm fertilizing the eggs. This phenomenon is termed sperm competition. In response, females have evolved larger spermathecae, spermicides, and an enhanced ability to select sperm based on the fitness of male suitors. Scathophaga stercoraria displaying either polyandry or monogamy differ in female fitness. When females are placed in enforced polyandrous or monogamous mating conditions, females from polyandrous conditions exhibit substantially reduced fitness, displaying decreased egg production, decreased number of offspring, and a shortened life span compared to monogamous females after only one mating experience. Initially, it was suggested that the Sexy son hypothesis was enough to compensate for the direct impact of antagonistic coevolution on female fitness. However, the detrimental fitness impact in females singly-mated with a polyandrous male suggests adaptations to resist harm by males requires competition, and is therefore better explained by interlocus sexual conflict.  In Drosophila melanogaster  Copulation in Drosophila melanogaster Drosophila melanogaster are a promiscuous species in which mate choice is a recurring event, fostering the development of interlocus sexual conflict. The ejaculate of male fruit flies contains seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) that play a significant role in determining female fitness. SPFs are capable of influencing processes such as oogenesis, sperm storage, and the onset of ovulation. This ultimately leads to a decrease in female fitness, as increasing behaviours such as egg-laying can decrease the success of fertilization, delay remating, and impact the female‚Äôs life span. In response to the negative effects of SPFs, female fruit flies have evolved resistance tactics to hyperactive males and refractoriness, resulting in interlocus sexual conflict. This has been supported in studies revealing the rapid evolution of SPF genes. In a study examining fruit flies under polygamous and monogamous conditions, it was discovered that antagonistic coevolution decreases in monogamy, as the organisms mate with only one opposite-sex member and there is no competition among males to mate with the female. In another laboratory study, a mutation that reduces the attractiveness of females was introduced into the genome of the experimental females. By reducing the attractiveness of the females expressing the trait, the mutation provided females with resistance to the direct costs of re-mating and male courtship. These results show that the resistance allele significantly accumulated in the experimental group, suggesting that the direct costs of male-courtship are greater than the indirect benefits of male- courtship. Reciprocal crosses of Drosophila melanogaster have been used to investigate the evolution of sexual traits under allopatric conditions. In divergent populations, organisms will respond adaptively to local mates but not foreign mates. As a result, the female remating rate decreased significantly upon introduction of foreign males. Females are most resistant to males they coevolved with in local conditions, but show limited defense against foreign males.

Life Born in Oxfordshire, he was the illegitimate son of Ozias Humphry by Delly Wickens, daughter of an Oxford shopkeeper, called Upcott from the maiden name of Humphry's mother. His father bequeathed to him his miniatures, pictures, drawings, and engravings, as well as correspondence with many leading figures. Upcott was initially a bookseller, at first an assistant of Robert Harding Evans of Pall Mall, and then of John Wright of Piccadilly. While at Wright's shop he attracted the attention of John Ireland, William Gifford, and the writers of the Anti-Jacobin who met there, and he witnessed the scuffle there between Gifford and John Wolcot, helping to eject Wolcot. When Richard Porson was made librarian of the London Institution, Upcott was appointed as his assistant (23 April 1806), and he continued in the same position under William Maltby. On 30 May 1834 he resigned his office. Upcott spent the rest of his days at 102 Upper Street, Islington. The house in his time was called \\"Autograph Cottage\\"; among many autographs collected by Upcott was that of William Blake, in 1826, with whom he was on good terms, as his father had been, and made some significant introductions to Blake (Henry Crabb Robinson and Dawson Turner).G. E. Bentley Jr., The Stranger from Paradise: A Biography of William Blake (2003), p. 48, p. 330 and p. 360. In imitation of the plan adopted by William Oldys, he fitted up a room with shelves and a hundred receptacles into which he dropped cuttings on different subjects. The Guildhall Library originated in a suggestion by him, and in 1828 he superintended the arrangement of the books in it. Upcott died, unmarried, at Islington on 23 September 1845. Collector The walls in Upcott's rooms, whether at the London Institution or at home in Islington, were covered with paintings, drawings, and prints, most of them by Thomas Gainsborough or Humphry; all the drawers, shelves, boxes, and cupboards were crammed with his collections. In 1833, while still at the London Institution, he was robbed of the whole of his collection of gold and silver coins and some other curiosities; ¬£500 was voted to him. Upcott's library, books, manuscripts, prints, and drawings were sold by Sotheby at Evans's auction-rooms, 106 New Bond Street (15 June 1846 and following days), and are said to have realised ¬£4,125 17s. 6d. He owned about 32,000 letters, illustrated by three thousand portraits, many of which were engraved in Charles John Smith's Historical and Literary Curiosities. Many of the autograph letters were bought for the nation, and now form Additional MSS. 15841 to 15957 at the British Museum.These volumes, 116 in number, comprise 15841‚Äì54, albums mostly of foreign princes and scholars; 15856, papers of John Nicholas; 15857‚Äì8 and 15948‚Äì51, Browne and Evelyn papers; 15859‚Äì64, Thomas Burton's diary (edited by J.

The sketch-books of Ozias Humphry (Addit. MSS. 15958‚Äì69) were purchased by Thomas Rodd at the sale, but were at once resold to the British Museum. The main parts of Upcott's collections which were not acquired by the British Museum consisted of the correspondence of Ralph Thoresby (which was edited by Joseph Hunter) and of Emanuel da Costa. A large series of autograph letters from Upcott's stores was purchased by Captain Montagu Montagu, R.N., and left by him at his death in 1863 to the Bodleian Library. Many of Humphry's works passed at Upcott's death to his friend, Charles Hampden Turner. In 1836 Upcott privately printed a brief catalogue of his letters, manuscripts, and state papers, in the hope that they might be bought for some public institution. One of his major finds was the original manuscript of Thomas Chatterton's extravaganza Amphitryon, which he chanced upon in the shop of a city cheesemonger. It was purchased by the British Museum in 1841. Works Upcott published in 1818, in three volumes, a Bibliographical Account of the Principal Works relating to English Topography. It was later largely superseded by the British Topography (1881) of John P. Anderson, who refers in his preface to Upcott's \\"excellent catalogue\\". Upcott revised for the press the first edition of John Evelyn's Diary, brought out by William Bray in 1818, and for the edition of 1827 he collated the copy with the original manuscript at Wotton and made corrections. In 1825 he further edited Evelyn's Miscellaneous Writings. He reprinted in 1814 Andrew Borde's Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge, and in 1819 Edmund Carter's History of the County of Cambridge. Robert Southey was indebted to Upcott for the transcript of Thomas Malory's King Arthur (1817), and Upcott corrected it for the press. He took an active part in the publication of the Garrick Correspondence, and in the preparation of the Catalogue of the London Institution; and assisted in compiling the Biographical Dictionary of 1816.

It is located on a hill on an island in the Volga Delta, between the Volga, the Kutum, and the Tsarev. About For centuries, the Astrakhan Kremlin was inapproachable stronghold in the south-eastern border of Russia. A series of historical events are related to the fortress: the Crimean Turkish hiking on the lower Volga in the 16th century, the \\" Troubles \\" in Russia and the peasant uprising led by Stepan Razin in the 17th century, the transformation of the tsar Peter the Great Period, revolt of archers in 1705-1706, development of the Caspian navy in the 18th century, the reinforcement of the country's borders and entry into a part of Russian territories of the Caucasus and Central Asia. In 1552, Tsar Ivan IV conquered the Kazan Khanate. Four years later, Russian troops took Astrakhan. When the Middle and Lower Volga Region was joined, Moscow department acquired access to the Caspian Sea, in the new lands began to emerge and strengthen the Russian city. Astrakhan Uspenskii sobor of kreml The first construction of the Kremlin began in 1587- 1588 under the guidance of sapper, a lector of Discharge Order ‚Äì I.G. Vorodkov. He laid the first wooden fortress with powerful solid walls and towers. The place of construction was chosen on the hill, known as ‚ÄúRabbit‚Äù or ‚ÄúZayachii‚Äù in Russian. It was definitely the best place to build the fortress, because from the west and the north the hill was surrounded by the Volga River, and south and east ‚Äì by lakes and marshes. During the reign of Ivan IV The Terrible and Boris Godunov the wooden fortress was rebuilt into a stone one. For the development of Kremlin walls and towers state-owned official masters were headed from Moscow to Astrakhan. The chiefs of creation and planning of stone fortress were Mikhail Ivanovich Veliyaminov, Grigorii Ovcin and lecturer Dei Gubastii. For best results executives used the old, but very strong Tatar plinths which were brought from the ruins of the cities of the Golden Horde towns. Stone citadel was built by the type of Moscow Kremlin. History=Construction and early history The walls of the Astrakhan Kremlin were equipped with prongs the slots of which allowed to fire from handguns against enemies. At the same place at the top tier were formed \\"Varnitsa\\"--holes through which boiled water or hot tar was poured on attackers. During those times the system of organization of ‚Äúfire fighting‚Äù of the fortress was invoked as one of the most modern systems in whole Russia. Construction of Assumption Cathedral, which began in 1699 on the first of October, was probably the most significant event that was held on the territory of the Astrakhan Kremlin. Thirty professional stonemasons were invited led by bondman architect Dorotheos Myakisheva. Building of the Cathedral lasted almost 12 years. During this time, the architects created the temple with proper cubic form with five heads. The external of the Cathedral was decorated with molded brick and carved with white stone. Windows and dome heads were framed by columns in the style of Corinthian d√©cor and semicircular arches were filled with paintings with biblical plot. Three of such arches were arranged on each side of the temple. The cathedral was divided into two floors: the upper church is dedicated to the honor of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin. Tall and light temple was intended for ceremonial worships during warm months. The lower church which is dark lightened and surrounded by the gallery columns. In 1710 the bell tower cathedral was constructed under the control of architect Dorothea Myakisheva. In addition to bells, the watch was also installed, which created freshness and uniqueness in the city. The next two centuries were relatively calm for the Kremlin. Its buildings were repaired, rebuilt and renewed. Twentieth century At the beginning of the 20th century, after the October Revolution, access to the Territory of Kremlin was closed. Instead it was transformed as a military post, where groups of Red Guards were formed the Military Revolutionary Committee was placed. In January 1918 Astrakhan Kremlin was once again in the middle of fateful events, when supporters of Soviet power fought with Astrakhan Cossacks. They attacked The Red Army that was entrenched in the Kremlin, from the roofs of nearby buildings. Serious destruction was caused to the Kremlin after this battle. Miraculously the temples of Kremlin have survived. In 1919 the Army was reorganized under the leadership of Kirov to protect the outfall of Volga and to defeat the White Guard troops and foreign interventionists. Thus, in the early 20th century the Kremlin remained a military target. It was popularly named as ‚ÄúThe Town of Trotsky‚Äù (in 1992-1926). Only after the end of World War II did the town open access to the Kremlin. At the same time, the Kremlin ceased to be subject of military purposes. In the middle of the 20th century, significant restoration works were held, due to which many buildings, requiring urgent repairs were saved. Museum In 1974 the Astrakhan Kremlin became a museum and in 1980 became part of the Astrakhan State United Historical-Architectural Museum-Reserve. Nowadays citizens and tourists of Astrakhan have access to museum exhibits of the lifestyle of the Astrakhan Garrison. Moreover, they can see Casual Suits archers and scorers, elements of their weapons and ammunition, the exhibition dedicated to the history of popular uprisings and corporal punishment. In 2011, after the restoration of the Kremlin, the Guardhouse exposition was opened, which tells visitors about the life of Astrakhan military garrison of the 19th century.

Many HP ePrint technologies use cloud resources to provide mobile printing capabilities for specific HP ePrint-enabled printers and MFPs and for other printers using applications that provide network printing. The HP ePrint portfolio of mobile printing solutions includes the following: HP ePrint via Email HP ePrint data flow HP ePrint via Email is a feature of most HP printers and MFPs that enables printing documents attached to email messages sent to the device. The HP ePrint-capable printer or MFP must be registered to an HP ePrint cloud service called HP ePrint Center, which assigns a unique email address to the printer or MFP. The assigned email address is customizable but by default is arbitrarily set to promote security since only those who know the email address can use it to print. HP ePrint via Email does not require a print driver installed on the client. The HP ePrint public cloud renders the printing data from each separate attachment into a suitable print data stream, such as PCL3, PCL 5, or PostScript, and, subsequently, sends it to the HP ePrint enabled printer. For this to work, the attachments for printing must be in a native plain format, such as any of the following: *MS Word document *MS PowerPoint presentation *MS Outlook document *Image file (JPEG, BMP, GIF, PNG, TIFF) *Adobe Acrobat file (PDFs) *Text file and Rich Text Format (RTF) *HTML file Any email-capable client, including a smartphone, a tablet computer, a laptop, or any other email client, can submit print jobs to HP ePrint via Email. Anything that can send email can print. Registered users can also log into HP ePrint Center to manage and view their print jobs, their printers, and their settings. For example, HP ePrint Center provides options to create lists of users approved to print, and it includes spam filters to prevent unwanted print requests. Users can also change the email address of the HP ePrint- enabled printer or MFP by requesting a new one (each HP ePrint email address must be unique and, thus, must be approved). Figure 1 shows how data flows from the email client to the HP ePrint public cloud server (HP ePrint Center) for rendering into an acceptable print stream format and then forwarded to the HP ePrint enabled printer or MFP. HP ePrint Public Print Locations HP ePrint Public Print Locations data flow HP ePrint Public Print Locations is a mobile printing service that prints from the cloud using one of the HP ePrint mobile device apps. HP ePrint Public Print Locations is meant for people who use printers while traveling. It also enables a business or a public facility to charge for printing. For example, a businessperson preparing for a presentation can print handouts at a destination hotel for a fee rather than carrying them as they travel, or a traveler can print a boarding pass at a hotel to save waiting in line at the airport. The HP ePrint apps are free and include versions for Apple iPhones and Android devices. Users can find it at iTunes App store or Google Play. It is also available for Blackberry mobile devices from BlackBerry App World. The HP ePrint apps lists various registered HP ePrint public printers at locations, such as hotels, airports, and print shops. When a user submits a print job to HP ePrint Public Print Locations, the service returns a notification email message with an authorization code that is required for printing at the device. This authorization code prevents unwanted printing and depending on the business model enables the owner of the printer to charge for printing before the documents are printed. The HP ePrint Service app uses GPS coordinates to locate and map HP ePrint public printers nearby. The user can use smartphone navigation features for directions to the location of the HP ePrint Public Print Location. HP ePrint Public Print Locations supports the following file formats for printing: *Microsoft Office (‚Äô95-2010) Word, Excel, PowerPoint *Microsoft Visio *OpenOffice.org (2.X/3.X) *StarOffice (StarWriter, StarCalc, StarChart, StarDraw, StarImpress) *Adobe Acrobat (PDF) *Text and Rich Text Format *Image files (PNG, BMP, JPEG, GIF, TIFF) The HP ePrint Public Print Locations service maintains a database of public print providers. Each provider, upon receiving a print request, renders the print data accordingly and sends the print data stream (PCL or Postscript) to a destination print queue. To retrieve the print job, the user goes to the printer location kiosk and types the authorization code to release and print the print job(s). HP ePrint Enterprise Blackberry data flow iOS and Android data flow HP ePrint Enterprise is a private cloud printing solution for use in large networks, such as those in SMB, large corporations, or academic environments where IT departments can manage private cloud services. It provides a mobile printing option for people, such as mobile workers, who travel from office to office and need printing at remote locations. HP ePrint Enterprise also supports direct email printing from a corporate email service to HP and non-HP printers and MFPs. The HP ePrint Enterprise (service) app enables users to submit print jobs to private company printers or to public print locations. The user must be registered with the company‚Äôs HP ePrint Enterprise server to view the company‚Äôs private printers in the HP ePrint Enterprise (service) app. The HP ePrint Enterprise server is an ASP.NET application that is supported on Windows Server 2003/2008. It can send print jobs to any network-connected printer capable of PS, PCL5, or PC3-GUI language support. The following are system requirements for the HP ePrint Enterprise server application: *Windows Server 2003 or 2008 R2 (32 or 64 bit) *Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) *Microsoft SMTP server *Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) *Microsoft Office (full installation) *Microsoft Windows Installer *Office Primary Interop Assemblies (PIA) *Microsoft .NET Framework (3.5) *Microsoft SQL Server 2008 (or Express) The method of sending data to the printer or MFP depends on the type of mobile device in use (i.e. Android, iOS, or BlackBerry). Android and iOS mobile devices use a direct connection to the HP ePrint Enterprise server. BlackBerry devices access the HP ePrint Enterprise network resources indirectly via the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES); because of the indirect communication between the Blackberry device and the HP ePrint Enterprise server, the BlackBerry solution is considered more secure: print data never travels outside of the private network, and the channels that transmit print data can be secured and encrypted. HP ePrint Enterprise is scalable to adapt to varying workloads. It can operate in a master/slave configuration where the slave server handles the primary workload while the master server handles backup and redundancy. The master server dispatches print jobs to appropriate slave servers. As the workload increases, additional slave servers can be deployed. A large geographically dispersed company can have the master server as the primary point of communication at corporate headquarters and slave servers at local sites. These reliability and scalability features are essential for successful cloud computing architectures. HP ePrint Enterprise supports the following plain data file formats for printing: *MS Word (2007) document *MS PowerPoint presentation *MS Outlook *Image file (JPEG, BMP, GIF, PNG, TIFF) *Adobe Acrobat files (PDF) *Text file and Rich Text Format (RTF) *HTML file The HP ePrint Enterprise server accepts print jobs using two primary protocols: http/https and SMTP. Once the HP ePrint Enterprise private cloud printing service accepts a print job message, it converts the print job into an appropriate printer language (PCL or Postscript) via an internal rendering process and submits it to the printer or MFP via TCP port 9100. HP ePrint Enterprise server is capable of processing multiple print jobs simultaneously by using a message queue service with the ability to track the progress of each individual print job. HP ePrint Enterprise server has a Web-based administration console, which any authorized user can access using a Web browser. This console provides settings for adding and managing users and print devices, configuring server settings, performing simple diagnostics, and tracking events. HP ePrint Enterprise can be configured for guest user access. This enables users outside the company to remotely print to company devices. Guest users are given access for 30 days by default. An administrator can change the access period to any time value and or revoke access at any time. HP ePrint Enterprise administrators can limit printing access to company devices by user (guest or regular) as needed. HP ePrint Wireless Direct Printing HP ePrint Wireless Direct Printing is a feature of some HP printers and MFPs that connects directly to mobile devices for printing. It requires the mobile device to have a compatible app that can print: *Apple AirPrint (standard on iOS version 4.2 or later) *HP ePrint *any other app that can send a print job An HP printer or MFP that has the HP ePrint Wireless Direct Printing feature behaves as a wireless access point where the mobile device connects as though it were on any wireless network. Once the device is connected, the user can print from any app that has printing options. iOS (4.2 or later) includes Apple Airprint, and can print using HP ePrint Wireless Direct Printing once the mobile device is connected to the printing device wireless access point. Android and other platforms can connect to an HP ePrint Wireless Direct printing device, but can print only with supported apps, such as HP ePrint. Apple AirPrint Apple AirPrint is a mobile print subsystem included with iOS 4.2 and later (for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch) that can find available printers and send them print jobs. Apple Inc. and HP collaborated to develop Apple AirPrint to enable iOS devices to print to many HP printers, but, since its introduction, many other printer manufacturers are producing compatible printers. HP considers Apple AirPrint as part of the HP ePrint portfolio of mobile printing solutions. Apple AirPrint creates a PDF internally, an HP filter (pdftopcl) renders the PDF into PCL data that the printer can process, and the printer prints it. Apple AirPrint begins when the user selects the Action button and chooses the Print option. Apple AirPrint searches the network for available printers using the mDNS network protocol. It filters the list of printers it finds and then displays only the compatible printers. All HP ePrint printers and MFPs are Apple AirPrint compatible. HP ePrint Mobile apps A screenshot of the HP ePrint Android app homescreen. HP ePrint includes three mobile printing apps: *HP ePrint (Android, iOS and BlackBerry) *HP ePrint Enterprise (service) (Android, iOS and Blackberry) *HP Designjet ePrint and Share These apps provide features necessary for printing from Android, iOS and Blackberry devices. HP is combining the features of several mobile printing apps to simplify the mobile printing experience for HP ePrint Wireless Direct Printing, HP ePrint Public Printing Locations, and HP ePrint Enterprise. HP ePrint via Email does not require a printing app, but HP ePrint Mobile apps function to configure settings and to organize email addresses and HP ePrint printers. HP ePrint provides printing capabilities for HP ePrint printers and MFPs, local area network (LAN) printers, and HP ePrint Public Printing locations. HP ePrint Enterprise (service) provides capabilities to use HP ePrint Public Printing Locations, HP ePrint Enterprise and print directly from Dropbox, Facebook, and Box. HP Designjet ePrint and Share provides cloud printing capabilities for HP Designjet printers. It also provides a means to share and preview print jobs before printing to save on costly proofs. HP ePrint Software HP ePrint Software (formerly HP ePrint Mobile Print Driver) is a mobile print driver for Windows or Macintosh computers that supports cloud printing, HP ePrint Wireless Direct printing, local area network (LAN) direct printing from any application to any HP printer and HP ePrint Public Printing Locations. It provides mobile printing features including searching for and connecting to compatible printers, duplex printing, and multiple pages per sheet. It also can print directly to network connected HP Postscript printing devices. It is the HP mobile print app for PCs.

From 1930 to 1934 this first Austin London taxicab was colloquially known as the High Lot or Upright Grand. On a new chassis and thereby much lowered its appearance was revised in 1934 and it was renamed by Austin the Low Loading taxi. Previously Austin had only provided hire car chassis not troubling to make major amendments to that chassis to comply with Metropolitan Police regulations for London taxicabs.Malcolm Bobbit, Taxi!: The Story of the London Taxicab, Veloce, Dorchester UK, 2011 History Will Overton, director of the car dealership Mann & Overton, had been selling Unic taxicabs in London since 1906. In 1924 their business with its French-made Unics had provided almost 80% of the new taxicabs bought in London. In 1925, with effect from 1 May 1926, McKenna duties were imposed on commercial vehicles to protect UK manufacturers from imports and in spite of Unic's local assembly operation in Cricklewood, opened in 1928, it was no longer possible to supply London with French Unic taxicabs at an acceptable price. So William Overton approached Herbert Austin about modifying the Heavy Twelve-Four hire car chassis so that it would comply with the London Conditions of Fitness. It had been announced in 1927 that those regulations would be lightened with effect from 1928. In view of the easing of police regulations and the enormous gap in the market left by imported vehicles Austin duly modified their hire-car chassis to suit, and Mann & Overton arranged for their catalogued three standard bodies made in Greater London by: Strachan or Vincent or ‚Äì for ¬£5 more ‚Äì Jones.

So it was agreed that Austin would supply the engine/chassis and Carbodies in Coventry the body, although it was actually designed by Austin's chief body designer Jim Stanfield. In 1948 a new Austin taxi appeared on the streets called the FX3. It was soon the market leader. Although in 1952 a diesel engine from Perkins Engines was available as a conversion, by 1954 Austin was producing their own 2.2 litre diesel engine as a factory fit. Also made by Austin and Carbodies was the hire car FL1 which was almost identical but lacking luggage space by the driver, having instead a bench seat, and there was no roof sign.

There is a waiting list of more than 50 individuals to fill stamping positions. Information on how to mail valentines is available on the Loveland Chamber‚Äôs website.http://www.reporterherald.com/news_story.asp?id=30981 The Valentine Re-mailing Program inspired the Loveland Chamber to produce the, ‚Äúofficial Loveland valentine card‚Äù each year.

ATP publishes training materials for career and technical education, industrial training, and apprenticeship programs. It is the only employee-owned career and technical publisher in the country.  History  ATP was founded in 1898 by R. T. Miller, Jr. as the American Technical Society (ATS). The ATS published instructional materials for the American School of Correspondence, which was also founded by Miller. In 1902, Miller moved both companies from Boston to Chicago. Today, the building that housed both companies is recognized as a Chicago landmark. During World War II, the ATS changed its primary publishing material to vocational training materials for preparation of industrial workers for the war effort. In the early 1960s, the Vocational Education Act of 1963 and subsequent appropriations provided increased federal funding for the expansion of vocational education programs. This act allowed companies, such as the ATS, to develop new training materials for vocational studies. In March 1980, the company American Technical Publishers, Inc. Profit Sharing Retirement Plan and Trust purchased the assets of the Society. The Society then became known as the Technical Foundation of America, and ATP became its own company. The current President is Robert D. Deisinger.  The ATP Building  An exterior shot of the LEED-Certified ATP Building. In November 2008, ATP opened its new headquarters building in Orland Park, Illinois. In order to reduce the harmful effects a building can have on the environment, the ATP Building was constructed as a sustainable green building, conforming to the established LEED requirements. The building was built by Morgan/Harbour Construction and has earned LEED Gold Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Some of its green features include sunshades on exterior windows and raised flooring. The sunshades on the exterior windows reduce the amount of energy needed to warm and cool the office by offering a natural way to control temperature. The raised flooring also reduces energy by minimizing the amount of ductwork. In October 2010, the Economic Development Council for the Southwest Suburbs, an organization affiliated with the Workforce Development and Community Services department at Moraine Valley Community College, presented ATP with the Sustainability Award for its new building and commitment to sustainable practices.  Products  ATP publishes career and technical (formally vocational) training materials for a variety of fields, such as electrical, construction, welding, culinary, CAD and technical drawing, and boiler operations. Materials include textbooks, workbooks, instructor resource guides, and digital media.

Aims The NRG opposes the Dutch monarchy because of its successive nature and seeks to form a republic through democratic means. The NRG seeks to bridge the discrepancy between the Dutch form of government and its democratic order by creating a republican form of government. The NRG achieves this by the numerous developments and incidents, as result of the inevitable friction, critically examining them and stimulating the discussion of this matter. Nationally but also regionally, the NRG is active in this field. The association only wants to make use of legal means; the spoken and written word are the main ingredients of this. All forms of physical violence, as well as activities that are contrary to generally accepted forms of behaviour, are explicitly rejected. This includes personal attacks, for example on the members of the royal family. The association is open to anyone, regardless of political conviction or social standing, and has both members and sympathisers.  History  De Republikein, magazine of the 'old' and New Republicans The immediate cause of the establishment of the NRG were the celebrations which marked the sixtieth anniversary of Queen Beatrix and the closing of the Dam in Amsterdam for these festivities. On 20 January 1998, the NRG released a Republican manifesto, and on 29 January of the same year former NRG spokesman Erik van den Muijzenberg, under the eyes of the international press, proclaimed the Third Republic of the Netherlands on Dam Square. In 2005, the Republican Society and New Republican Society co-founded the magazine De Republikein (\\"The Republican\\"); all 1300 NRG members at the time automatically became subscribers. From a small movement with a few members, the organization in eight years time grew into a union with more than 1,300 members and seven regional offices as of 2006. The NRG states the royal house is outdated, and thus protested against the monarchy on 30 April 2013 The society protested the wedding of Crown Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Maxima Zorreguieta on 2 February 2002. Following the enlargement of the European Union, thirteen Republican organizations from all the monarchies of the EU on 1 May 2004, sent a petition to the European Parliament. The thirteen organizations asked the abolishment of constitutional monarchy throughout the European Union. The petition is an initiative of the Belgian Republican Circle (Republikeinse Kring-CRK). In the Netherlands, the petition was signed by the NRG. In June 2010, several European republican movements, including the NRG, founded the AERM: the Alliance of European Republican Movements. This organisation is an umbrella of republican organisations in the seven main European countries that are still monarchies. In 2015, Arjen Lubach succeeded Joanna (left) as Republican of the Year for satirising the Dutch monarchy Early April 2013, the NRG reported having seen its membership grown rapidly with 800 people in the preceding two months (on top of the 1200 there were in January). It attributed this growth to the 'Orange hype' in the run-up to the investiture of Willem-Alexander later that month.‚ÄûSnelle aanwas republikeinen‚Äù, ANP/Reformatorisch Dagblad, 6 April 2013. Chair Anjo Clement claimed on 21 April 2013 that the monarchy would not exist in twenty years time, because of the bumpy road Willem-Alexander has had on his way to become king, especially regarding his villa in Mozambique and the denial of Zorreguieta's part in Argentina's dictatorship during the Dirty War. A citizen's initiative on the monarch's salary started by the NRG was signed by over 13,000 people.\\"Nederlandse monarchie bestaat over twintig jaar niet meer\\" NU.nl, 21 April 2013 Each year, the NRG awards the title of Republican of the Year to the person that has best encouraged discussion on the abolishment of the monarchy. In 2015, comedian Arjen Lubach was given the award for the 22 March 2015 episode of his satirical talkshow Zondag met Lubach, in which he mocked the monarchy by proclaiming himself \\"Pharao of the Netherlands\\" and launched a citizens' initiative with more than 100,000 signatures to confirm it. He succeeded Utrecht student Joanna, who in 2013 caused national uproar by publicly protesting with a sigh that said: \\"Weg met de monarchie. Het is 2013.\\" (\\"Down with the monarchy. It's 2013\\").  Offsplits  Pro Republica logo * At the end of 2003, disagreement arose in the NRG about the invitation policy for an NRG theme night. In protest, Peter Nugter of the Republican Socialists, founded the New Republican Fellowship in 2004. This association has never become active, and was later dissolved. * In September 2004, board member Frits Hoogesteger left.

Besides being the youngest MP in Parliament, Tin was also the PAP's youngest candidate in the 2011 Singapore general election. She is serving as the Chairperson of the Ulu Pandan Youth Executive Committee for the Young PAP (YPAP), the PAP's youth wing, and a member of the Community Development Welfare Fund Committee. Background Tin attended Crescent Girls' School and Hwa Chong Junior College during her adolescent years. She attended the National University of Singapore to major in psychology. Prior to the formation of the 17th Young PAP Executive Committee marked by the 2011 elections, Tin was formerly assistant treasurer for Young PAP and a representative for the Ulu Pandan branch. Career=2011 general election In the 2011 general election, Tin was selected as a candidate for the Marine Parade GRC alongside former prime minister Goh Chok Tong among others. Having been a member of the Ulu Pandan branch of the Young PAP for 7 years, she was fielded by the PAP as a candidate to attract the \\"unpredictable\\" youth vote through social networking sites. On election day, the PAP took Marine Parade GRC with 56.65% of the votes, defeating National Solidarity Party's team led by Cheo Chai Chen Goh Chok Tong admitted after the election that Tin's youth and negative image perceived by the public was a \\"factor\\" for the People's Action Party's weaker performance this election compared to their 72.9% win in 1992. On 1 June 2011, Tin announced on her Facebook account that she had resigned from her Senior Associate position in Ernst & Young, where she had worked for four years. She said the decision was made in order to focus on her responsibilities as full-time MP in her MacPherson ward and the Marine Parade GRC. Tin's selection as a candidate for Parliament in 2011 resulted in a large online backlash, especially amongst young Singaporeans. Throughout the campaign, Tin garnered negative attention due to her perceived immaturity to become an MP, and allusions were also raised as to how her husband's position had opened doors for her into politics. A widely circulated Facebook photo of Tin posing with a Kate Spade- branded gift from her husband, also led to widespread accusations online of ignorance, materialism and privilege. When asked if there was a policy she would change, she replied that there were no policy that she felt strongly against. When asked what her \\"greatest regret\\" was, she said it was not having brought her (still living) parents to Universal Studios Singapore. Some Singaporeans were concerned that as an \\"undeserving [candidate],\\" Tin had a high chance of being elected \\"not on [her] own merit, but rather on the back of established MPs\\" since the 5-member PAP team would be voted in or rejected as a group under Singapore's Group Representative Constituency system. The public's online hostility towards Tin was so great that Goh Chok Tong defended her in the press. He said he had taken Tin in when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had offered her to be fielded as a candidate in his GRC. He had accepted her as he did not think Tin was a weak candidate. He dismissed the online criticisms as \\"distortion\\" and even though \\"some sound bites of her which pitted her as a rather light-weight person\\", it was just \\"a superficial view\\". He still believed that she \\"would work very hard\\", \\"[could] reach out to the young, and the not so young,\\" that he \\"would like her to do more to help the old people in MacPherson,\\" and that she would become \\"a good MP in due course\\". Nicole Seah from the National Solidarity Party (NSP) team in Marine Parade GRC filed a complaint to the Elections Department on 6 May 2011, stating that Tin had violated the state-mandated cooling-off period 24 hours before polls by posting a Facebook comment on Seah crying during her walkabout. Under the Singapore Parliamentary Elections Act, canvassing on Polling Day and Cooling Off Day is prohibited and the offence carries a fine or imprisonment or both. When questioned, Tin replied that one of her administrators, Denise He, had posted the comment under her account and that He had meant to post in her own capacity from her phone, but had forgotten to log out of Tin's account. The NSP team was advised by the Elections Department to file a police report before the Elections Department could investigate. The police confirmed that a report was lodged against her. The police issued a stern warning to Tin as well as Seah, who also had a similar complaint lodged against her. 2015 general election In the 2015 Singaporean general election, MacPherson SMC was split from Marine Parade GRC for the first time since the 2006 elections. She ran against Bernard Chen of the Workers' Party and Cheo Chai Chen of the National Solidarity Party. Cheo's campaign suffered a major blunder when he described Tin's new role as a mother as \\"her weakness\\" in the campaign. Facing public backlash, Cheo later claimed that this comment was meant as a joke. She received 17,227 votes, or 65.58% of the total, compared to Chen's 33.6% and Cheo's 0.82%. 2020 general election In the 2020 Singaporean general election, Tin Pei Ling defended her seat in MacPherson SMC with 71.74% of the vote against Goh Meng Seng of the People's Power Party. She was then appointed Chairperson of the Communications and Information Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) in the 14th Parliament of Singapore. Personal life Tin is married to Ng How Yue, Second Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Trade and Industry and formerly a Principal Private Secretary to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Tin Pei Ling has a child that was born on 5 August 2015. She also has another child that was born on 25 September 2018.

Life He graduated from Columbia Law School. In May 1905, he was appointed by Mayor George B. McClellan as a Police Magistrate, and in July a judge of the Court of Special Sessions. In November 1906, McAvoy ran on the Tammany Hall ticket for the Court of General Sessions but was defeated by Republican Otto Rosalsky, who had been endorsed by the Independence League in defiance of the Tammany/Independence L. fusion ticket. At the same election, Recorder John W. Goff was elected to the New York Supreme Court. The vacancy was to be filled by the Board of Aldermen, but the election was deadlocked because no party had a majority. The Republicans voted for Alderman James Cowden Meyers, the Democrats for McAvoy, and the Municipal Ownership Leaguers for Judge John Palmieri. On the first ballot, on January 7, 1907, Meyers had 34, McAvoy 27 and Palmieri 12 votes. The deadlock continued when, on January 15, suddenly the M.O.L. aldermen voted for Rufus B. Cowing instead of Palmieri. Hours later Alderman Clifford was arrested and accused of having received $6,000 to change the vote of his party friends. After another week of accusations and much noise in the press, McAvoy received the votes of the M.O.L. and was elected on the 24th ballot (McAvoy 42; Meyers 35 votes) on January 22, 1907, as Recorder of New York City to fill the vacancy until the end of the year. Due to a prolonged illness, McAvoy took his seat on the bench in the Court of General Sessions (of which the Recorder was one of the judges) only on May 6, 1907. In the meanwhile, D.A. William Travers Jerome and Gov. Charles Evans Hughes introduced legislation in the New York State Assembly which abolished the office of Recorder‚Äîone of the oldest offices in New York, in existence since 1683‚Äîat the end of the year, and called for the election of an additional judge of General Sessions instead. McAvoy died suddenly on August 6, 1926, dropping dead on the corner of 152nd Street and Broadway in Manhattan while on the way to his law office; he was buried at Saint Raymonds Cemetery New in the Bronx.

As a result, the Korean Empire became a protectorate of the Empire of Japan.Hulbert, Homer. The History of Korea. pp. 461-462. This treaty deprived Korea of its national sovereignty. The treaty also allowed the Empire of Japan to build the Japanese Government- General Building in Seoul and appoint a resident-general. The treaty of 1905 led to the foundation of the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907. In March 1908, the National Diet of Japan passed the bill establishing the Oriental Development Company that the government of Korea was forced to sign. It was initially managed by both the Korean Empire and the Empire of Japan. When the headquarters were moved to Tokyo in 1917, it became wholly owned by the Empire of Japan. In 1927 Na Seok-ju, a Korean independence movement activist, bombed the building in Seoul, which resulted in the death of some of the managers.\\"Movement of Activist Na Seok Ju\\".

Despite this incident, the company started to create more branches in countries abroad, such as Taiwan, Manchuria, Sakhalin, and South Pacific Mandate. In 1938 there were nine branches with over 800 employees.  History = Migration  Due to a decrease in arable land in Japan, Imperial Japan decided to establish migration policies that would help people move to the Korean Peninsula to farm. It has been estimated that the Korean branch of the company accepted 85,000 Japanese people in 1904, and about 500,000 had migrated there by 1908.Thomas F. Millard, Japanese Immigration into Korea Company land had been given to Japanese colonists up to the spring of 1924, amounting to more than 8,000 landmass and normal immigrants reached 246,767, thus put together, forming one-seventh of the whole arable land attained by Japanese migrants.Dong-A Ilbo (13 December 1924). \\"On Colonial Policy\\".

The large amounts of landmass held by Japanese migrants gained taxes for the authorities. Indigenous farmers lost their independence. According to Arthur C. Bunce, land tenure was the most common approach for farmers, since there was not other employment. 75% of Korean farmers became tenants.Far Eastern Survey- JSTOR.org. Arthur C.

Northern populations are identifiable by their shiny black bodies and black and yellow reticulated forewings. Some southern populations are yellow in the adult stage. The species is unique in using its black coloration to thermoregulate and in being chemically defended. The aposematic coloration warns vertebrate predators of its unpalatability and allows the grasshopper to roost conspicuously upon desert shrubs. Etymology T. eques was first described by Hermann Burmeister in 1838. The vernacular lubber refers to the flightless terrestrial status of the subfamily Romaleinae. Eques is the Latin term for \\"horseman\\". Description T. eques is one of the largest grasshopper species in North America. A female of the species can reach 7 centimeters in length and weigh 9 grams. The mature male weighs 3 grams on average. There is a wide range of sizes due to influences in its specific habitat. Males stridulate more commonly than females by expanding the hindwings against the closed forewings, thus flashing the bright red hindwings. It is unique among desert grasshoppers because of its conspicuous size and coloring. The body is mostly black, with finely patterned black and yellow forewings with green veins and red hindwings with black borders. The antennae and head of the adult include orange markings. The forewings of males normally extend past the tip of the abdomen. However, most T. eques cannot fly, with only approximately 10 percent of males possessing wings long enough for flight. The T. eques nymph resembles the adult in coloration, except the nymph also possesses yellow head markings and black antennae. Distribution and habitat T. eques ranges from southern Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas to central Mexico, and inhabits the lower Sonoran life zone, which consists primarily of sparse desert brush and grasslands. It can be found among Acacia, Mimosa, Ephedra, and Yucca shrubs. In the United States, this grasshopper species is the only member of its genus (Taeniopoda) and one of the largest arthropods. In the United States, it inhabits the Chihuahuan Desert community from southern Arizona to the Big Bend region of Texas. The Chihuahuan Desert receives a high amount of summer precipitation compared to other deserts, which is necessary for the grasshopper's development. Diet T. eques does not feed on the same plants it roosts on. In an experiment, it was found to be unable to survive on Acacia and Mimosa shrubs alone. It feeds mainly on foliage, flowers, and seed pods of low-growing summer desert annuals. T. eques only forages during daylight hours; at night it roosts near the tops of desert shrubs to hide from nocturnal ground predators. At dawn, it descends to the desert floor to feed on the annual plant species which are abundant following summer rains. T. eques drink free-standing water from raindrops. T. eques is known to be polyphagous, and also consumes a variety of other material, including spider silk and feces. It is an opportunistic carnivore and can occasionally be found scavenging for insect and vertebrate cadavers. It can detect odors to find mammal and insect carcasses, which may provide a source of protein and nitrogen in the diet. The female is more likely engage in scavenger behavior than the male T. eques. This difference may be explained by the female's greater need for protein and other nutrients to facilitate more rapid maturation and egg production. Cannibalism has been observed upon molting or incapacitated individuals of its own species. Life cycle T. eques is univoltine, producing only one brood of offspring per year. Females lay eggs at the base of shrubs or large rocks, depositing the approximately 50 eggs in a single pod 4-8 centimeters deep into the soil. The females also eject a liquid with the eggs, which dries and forms a hard case protecting the egg pod. In the United States, eggs are deposited in subterranean egg pods in October. The number of egg pods laid is dependent upon the rate of development in the adults and the time available before the frost sets in. The grasshoppers reach maturity in October and die in November during the winter freeze. Thermoregulation is necessary for speeding the development of T. eques to increase its reproductive chances before the favorable growing season ends. Along with the onset of the summer rainy season, the young hatch in synchrony from subterranean egg pods in July. The larvae are especially vulnerable to predatory ants for about the first three minutes after hatching. After shedding the provisional cuticle, the larvae climb up the nearest vertical object. They are born reddish in color, but transform to black within two hours. Despite its large size, T. eques has a relatively speedy rate of larval development, undergoing five nymphal molts to reach the adult stage in about 40 days. Recently molted individuals are brown but darken within two hours at warm temperatures. Temperature influences whether they can complete the molting process. At temperatures less than 25 ¬∞C, molting is usually not initiated. At temperatures above 36 ¬∞C, they can become stuck in old exoskeletons. Individuals are exposed to predation and sibling cannibalism during molting. T. eques is different from other aposematic grasshoppers in its asynchronous molting. Mating begins about 12 days after maturity, and about 30 days after the adults molt, females begin laying egg pods each containing about 50 eggs. Egg pods are deposited 6 to 9 centimeters underground. Females continue to lay subsequent egg pods at 18-day intervals until they are killed by the freeze in November. Behavior=Thermoregulation Thermoregulation is necessary for all essential life functions of T. eques and most other behaviors, including food consumption and digestion, predator escape, reproduction, walking, flying, and ovipositing. The desert environment of T. eques is often unpredictable and allows the grasshopper only about four months, the time between the onset of the summer rains and the arrival of the winter freeze, to complete its entire life cycle. Growth and development are further slowed by cold desert nights, and in October, cold days. T. eques speed development by solar basking, aided by its black heat-absorbing coloration. By thermoregulating, the grasshopper can maintain an optimal body temperature between 30 and 40 degrees Celsius for most of the day. Elevating body temperature for extended periods allows T. eques to metabolize faster, thus permitting maximum growth and reproduction before the onset of winter. Without thermoregulation, T. eques could not survive in its northern range. The unique black coloration of T. eques is thermally beneficial, contributing to the species' shorter larval development compared to the light- colored desert grasshoppers. T. eques has also developed behavioral thermoregulatory mechanisms for sunlight exposure. Flanking occurs when the grasshopper orients its body perpendicular to sunlight, maximizing thoracic heat gain. The sun-side hindleg is lowered, the shade-side hindleg is raised, and the abdomen is lowered to reduce wing shading. Moving into the centers of bushes allows for shading to limit sun exposure at midday to prevent overheating. Defense Ants regularly attack hatching and molting nymphs. Vertebrates sharing the habitat of T. eques rarely disturb horse lubbers and prefer other lubber grasshopper species instead. Only invertebrates and grasshopper mice have been shown to be undeterred by adult T. eques defenses. T. eques possesses a multi-sensory defense system. The chemical secretion has a strong coffee-vanilla odor and composed of a complex mixture of synthesized phenolics and plant toxins produced from the grasshopper's diet. When consumed, the toxic tissues of T. eques cause vomiting or death in predators. The species relies on a comprehensive aposematic display containing chemical deterrents, and visual and auditory elements for defense against vertebrate predators. For example, when attacked by mice, the grasshoppers spray the odorous secretion from their metathoracic spiracles while producing a hissing noise. The secretion surrounds the insect in a noxious deterrent cloud. Adults also turn sideways to predators and display their bright red hindwings while waving their bright antennae and spiny hindlegs in a threatening manner. Together these signals warn na√Øve predators and remind experienced predators of the grasshopper's toxicity. Social behavior In the first stage of life, pod mates aggregate and move and feed together, but disperse after a few days. Aggregation is tightest in this first-instar period and may be a method of defense for the vulnerable developing grasshoppers. Thereafter they are solitary, although mature T. eques are attracted to the largest bush at dusk which provides the appearance of clumping. This behavior may provide benefits of increasing opportunities for mating and enhancing aposematic displays against predators. Sexual behavior and pheromones Both sexes of mature T. eques engage in promiscuous behavior. Males are sexually aggressive, actively mounting females and males of the species as well as individuals from other grasshopper and lizard species. Males cautiously stalk females before suddenly mounting without any communicatory leg or wing signaling. Females react violently when mounted by jumping, kicking, running, and rotating from side to side. However, immediately following copulation, females become docile and carry males on their backs. Males do not guard ovipositing females. The female T. eques releases a pheromone that elicits male attraction and sexual behavior over a short distance. Male T. eques can remain in copulation for up to 24 hours, continuously passing spermatophores to the female. Trait interaction Multiple phenotypic traits interact in T. eques since chemical defense from vertebrates releases the species from the need to be small and hidden. Thus T. eques has evolved a large body size, to increase fecundity, deter small invertebrate predators, increase water retention, and allow for deep ovipositing. However, the large adult size requires long development and growth, which is difficult in its short season. It speeds growth by thermoregulation mechanisms including dark color and solar exposure positions, both allowed only because of chemical defense. These features cause T. eques to be conspicuous; however, chemical deterrents protect it against predators. The species can allocate resources to reproduction instead of wings and flight muscles. As with many other chemically defended insects, T. eques is flightless and sluggish.

Early years Elizabeth Graeme, the sixth of nine children born to Dr. Thomas and Ann Diggs Graeme, spent much of her youth at Graeme Park, the family estate in Horsham, Pennsylvania, located outside of Philadelphia. Ann educated Elizabeth, teaching her to read and write, an advantage that most young girls in colonial America did not receive. Aside from writing poetry, Elizabeth's main literary project was the translation of Les Aventures de T√©l√©maque from the original French. Career When Elizabeth was seventeen, she met, and later began courting, William Franklin, son of Benjamin Franklin. The two were engaged in 1757. William moved to England to study law, and the couple's relationship became strained. A miscommunication had occurred and William believed the engagement had been broken, and he married another woman while in Britain, while Elizabeth thought the two were still engaged. In 1764, Elizabeth traveled to London at the urging of her mother, whose health was failing. Another reason to travel to London, was to lift her spirits from the recent breakup. While in London, Elizabeth met Laurence Sterne and King George III. While she was in England, she kept a travel journal, which was later circulated and read among her peers in Philadelphia. Upon returning to Graeme Park, Elizabeth learned that her mother had died while she was travelling. Elizabeth thus overtook the role of female head-of-household after her mother's death, hosting \\"attic evenings\\"‚Äîsalon gatherings for her elite male and female acquaintances. It was at one of these \\"attic evenings\\" that Elizabeth met Hugh Henry Fergusson. The two had a quick courtship, became engaged, and married secretly in 1772 and without the approval of her father. One month later, Elizabeth's father died of a stroke, never having learned of his daughter's marriage. As a result, he left the property at Graeme Park in her name, though under colonial law, Elizabeth was a feme covert, meaning that all of her property belonged to her husband when they were married. Henry spent much of the couple's marriage in England and in Philadelphia, working for the British. When the British evacuated the city of Philadelphia in 1778, Henry left for London. He sent a number of letters to Elizabeth pleading for her to join him in England, but she remained in Pennsylvania for the rest of her life. After the war, the Pennsylvania government confiscated Graeme Park, asserting that it was property that belonged to the alleged Loyalist Henry Fergusson. Elizabeth was forced to vacate the property and for two years lived with various acquaintances and family members. After two years of petitioning the government, Elizabeth finally regained the right to her property and moved back to Graeme Park in 1781. In 1791, however, Elizabeth could no longer afford the upkeep of the property and was forced to sell. For the final ten years of her life, Elizabeth lived with friends and wrote voraciously, publishing some of her poetry and participated in the writing of commonplace books with a number of her female acquaintances, such as Hannah Griffitts. She died in 1801, while being tended to by Benjamin Rush, very close to Graeme Park.Ann M. Ousterhout, The Most Learned Woman in America: A Life of Elizabeth Graeme Fergusson, University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2004. Elizabeth is buried on the south side of the churchyard of Christ Church in Philadelphia.  Writer  Elizabeth Ferguson wrote letters to get help regaining her property after it was confiscated. These letters tended to be forceful and vigorous in order for her to get the help she needed. On the other hand, her poems showed more of her emotional side. One of her longest and most poems was \\"Il Penseroso or The Deserted Wife\\". The poem had four parts: hope, solitude, doubt, and adversity. The poem traces the progress of her grieve as she feels abandoned by her husband. In part one, Fergusson is angry at her husband, Henry, because he deserted her but, more importantly, because there were rumors he had gotten a servant pregnant. Eventually, Ferguson realizes that she is not alone in her anger and grief. She realizes that she has many things in common with other loyalist women such as Grace Growden Galloway. In the second part of her poem, she writes \\"My Shattered Fortunes I with calmness Bore/ A Loss in Common but with thousand more\\". Her connection with other women is one reason she is regarded highly by historians.

Retirement After his retirement, Ogimura coached overseas in Sweden, China and USA. He got involved in Japanese Olympic Committee and Japan Table Tennis Association. He became an executive member of the International Table Tennis Federation in 1973 and president in 1987. In 1994, Ogimura died of lung cancer; he was survived by his wife, a son and two daughters. He was inducted into the ITTF Hall of Fame in 1997.  The \\"Ping- pong Diplomat\\"  Ichiro Ogimura was a key figure in the ‚ÄúPing-pong Diplomacy‚Äù of the early 1970s, and has been called ‚Äúa giant of sports diplomacy‚Äù and garnered the nickname, the ‚ÄúPing-pong Diplomat.‚Äù While the meeting of Glenn Cowan and Zhuang Zedong is often used as the catalyst for the ‚ÄúPing Pong Diplomacy‚Äù movement, Ogimura had already been working behind the scenes to arrange for China‚Äôs return to the international table tennis scene. On Ogimura‚Äôs insistence, Chinese Premier, Zhou Enlai, allowed the Chinese national team to take part in the 1971 World Table Tennis Championships in Nagoya, Japan. It was at this tournament where Cowen and Zedong had their chance meeting, an event which led to the meeting of President Nixon and Chairman Mao. The ‚Äúhighlight of Ogimura‚Äôs table tennis diplomacy‚Äù was his work in leading North Korea and South Korea to play as a unified Korean team at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba, Japan. Prior to the championships, Ogimura ‚Äúvisited South Korea 20 times and traveled to North Korea 15 times to plead for a unified team from the Korean peninsula. Ogimura worked with local Japanese government heads to create joint training camps in the cities of Nagano, Nagaoka in Niigata Prefecture, and Chiba, and secured agreement from the ITTF for North Korea and South Korea to compete under the unified name of ‚ÄúKorea‚Äù ‚Äì the first such occurrence since the Korean War. The unified Korean team played under a white flag depicting the Korean peninsula in blue, and used the Korean folksong, Arirang, rather than a national anthem of the North or the South. The competition saw the Korean team win one gold medal, one silver and two bronze medals. Ichiro Ogimura also served as the Japanese goodwill ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1954.  Playing Style  The \\"Fifty-One Percent Doctrine‚Äù was a playing style invented and popularised by Ogimura. It encouraged an aggressive playing style whereby a smash shot would be risked by a player if they believed they had a 51% or higher chance of defeating the opponent with it. This style was later adopted by world champions such as Zhuang Zedong and Stellan Bengtsson, to both of whom Ogimura served as a coach and mentor.  Equipment  Old advertisement of shoe designed by Ichiro Ogimura for table tennis for Japanese footwear brand, Koyo Bear. Ogimura was active in the development of table tennis equipment, designing a shoe especially designed for table tennis for Japanese footwear brand, Koyo Bear. In Britain, the shoes were marketed in cooperation with the table tennis equipment brand and co-branded with the Joola logo.

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year.

It is known from two partial skulls from the Richards Spur locality in Oklahoma. The holotype OMNH 74606 consists of a partial skull preserving snout and mandible, and the referred specimen, OMNH 74607, a partial skull preserving the skull roof, vertebrae and palatal elements. It was first named by Robert R. Reisz, Sean P. Modesto and Diane M. Scott in 2011 and the type species is Orovenator mayorum. The generic name means \\"mountain\\", oro, in Greek in reference to the Richards Spur locality, which was mountainous during the Permian period and \\"hunter\\", venator, in Latin. The specific name honours Bill and Julie May. Orovenator is the oldest and most basal neodiapsid to date. A 2018 redescription by David Ford and Roger Benson found that Orovenator shared many similarities with varanopids, a group of reptile-like tetrapods traditionally considered to be synapsids (amniotes more closely related to mammals than to modern reptiles). However, this proposed close relation between Orovenator and varanopids did not render Orovenator a synapsid; rather, it supported a placement for Varanopidae within Diapsida.

Raven is best known in technology circles by his birth name, Eran Feigenbaum, for his role as both the former director of security at Google Enterprise (2007-2016), and the former chief information security officer for Jet.com. Raven is famous in the US for his death-defying mentalism performances on NBC‚Äôs Phenomenon. Early life Eran Raven was born Eran Feigenbaum on March 3, 1972 in Tel Aviv, Israel. His mother was a high school principal and his father was a rocket scientist. His interest in magic began at an early age, and he gave his first public performance at age 11. He became interested in mentalism after he realized the way he asked questions could influence the person's response, or willingness to respond, to the request. Raven became fascinated by, and would make much use of, this nonverbal communication. Appearances Raven has appeared on stage in more than 35 countries in North America, Europe and Asia; and on more than 50 TV shows internationally. His biggest air date was on NBC's Phenomenon, before a broadcast audience of 8 million live viewers. In October and November 2007, Raven was one of ten mentalist contestants on the primetime NBC series Phenomenon, which was hosted by Tim Vincent and judged by Criss Angel and Uri Geller. He finished as runner-up on the series, after performing dangerous demonstrations of mentalism involving razor blades, snakes, scorpions, and nail guns. A demonstration with Holly Madison went wrong when Raven was bitten by a snake on live TV. He decided to continue after having his hand bandaged. Raven was seriously injured during rehearsals for another demonstration, which resulted in multiple ruptured disks in his back and relegated him to using a wheelchair, and a cane for a period thereafter. He has commented that he will reattempt this demonstration Death Drop. http://vegasrumors.blogspot.com/ Famous personalities Raven has \\"manipulated\\" include Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Owen Wilson and Sylvester Stallone. Security career As Eran Feigenbaum, he worked at Google as head of security for Google Enterprise, and gave multiple presentations before technical audiences the world over, and members of Congress. He has written security whitepapers with ex-Google CIO Douglas Merrill. Eran Feigenbaum is a frequent speaker at international security gatherings like Black Hat Security Conference and Hacker Halted, where he talks about why current security systems don't work, the vulnerability of passwords and how to think like a hacker. His areas of expertise include cybersecurity, perception management, social engineering and non-verbal cues. He is currently Chief Security Officer at Oracle. He sits on the board of a number of technology startups, including telemedicine innovator Curogram; technology company Peri; and KoolSpan, an encrypted mobile communications provider. Personal life Raven has been linked to Heather Sweet (AKA Dita Von Teese) when they went to University High School together, and TV personality Carmen Electra whom he met during his nail gun stunt on NBC's Phenomenon.

Two other special cases are well-known conjectures: there are infinitely many twin primes (n and 2 + n are primes), and there are infinitely many Sophie Germain primes (n and 1 + 2n are primes).

Much of Glaze's poetry reflects his coming of age in the South, and his eventual return there. He also lived and wrote in New York City for 31 years. In New York City he became part of a circle of poets that included Oscar Williams, Norman Rosten, John Ciardi and William Packard. Personal history Andrew Louis Glaze was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to Mildred Ezell Glaze and Dr. Andrew Louis Glaze M.D., a dermatologist. He grew up in Birmingham, Alabama with a younger sister and brother, and he graduated from Ramsay High School. He has been called both Andrew L. Glaze III, and Junior. His grandfather, Andrew Lewis Glaze, was a Confederate doctor during the Civil War. After graduating from the Webb School in Bell Buckle, Tennessee, Glaze went on to major in English at Harvard College. Immediately after graduating from Harvard in 1942, Glaze enlisted in the United States Air Force to serve during World War II. He sailed to Europe on the RMS Queen Mary, which had been converted into a troop transport ship that could carry 15,000 men. \\"The American poet Andrew Glaze, then an Air Force lieutenant, stood on the foredeck and looked down on 'a quarter of a mile of human circles shooting craps'.\\" When the war was over, while waiting his turn to be shipped back home, he attended the University of Grenoble. He died on February 7, 2016 in Birmingham, Alabama. Author Glaze began to have success with his writing and between May 1950, and February 1956, Poetry magazine published seven of his poems. In 1951, Karl Shapiro, the editor of Poetry at the time, awarded him the magazine's Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize At the same time, The New Yorker accepted one poem in 1950, and a second in 1955. He also had a short fiction piece appear in the 1953 4th Edition of New World Writing, and a poem in the 9th Edition in 1956. By January 19, 1957, The Saturday Review had accepted and published a poem titled Suwanee River. In 1957, Glaze moved with wife and daughter to Greenwich Village in New York City. Glaze wrote a poem entitled As I walk mornings down Bleecker Street (later retitled, \\"Alleluia\\"), and another poem, Village Parade, which appeared in his first book. A son was born, but by 1961 the couple had divorced. The move to Manhattan, and subsequent divorce were later incorporated into Glaze's poem and book titled A City. Glaze's ex-wife later became Dorothy Elliott Shari, and went on to join The Living Theatre, for a six-year tour of Europe. The move to New York may have been for many reasons, but it was hastened by a fear of reprisal for articles that Glaze had written as a reporter for the Birmingham Post-Herald. This was the dawn of the Civil rights movement, when racial segregation and Jim Crow laws were an everyday part of life in Birmingham. Glaze had testified against a deputy sheriff in defence of two black men. He also wrote about police brutality against demonstrators. In 1962, Glaze married his second wife, dancer and actress, Adriana Keathley. At the time they met, she was in the original Broadway cast of Camelot. She later danced in the original cast of Michael Bennett's Broadway show Ballroom. In Andrew Glaze's Greatest Hits 1964‚Äì2004, Glaze notes that his poem Night Walk to a Country Theater (originally in The New Yorker) was written on a visit to Connecticut where his wife was performing. The couple settled into an apartment on the West side of Manhattan, and for many years Glaze bicycled across town to the British Tourist Authority office on 5th Avenue and 54th Street, where he worked as a Press Officer, writing travel stories. His morning bicycle journey to work, heading East along 54th Street, inspired the poem Reality Street which was published in the magazine The Atlantic. The evening trip home, going West on 53rd Street, resulted in the matching poem Fantasy Street, which appeared in The New Yorker. Glaze referred to them as \\"Two Odes, after the fashion of Milton's L'Allego and Il Penseroso\\". In 1978, Glaze did a reading and interview on WNYC radio, and stated that before The New Yorker published Fantasy Street, they sent a fact checker out to follow the entire route of the poem and check every location mentioned in it for accuracy. That same year, the reviewer in New York Times described Glaze's poetry as \\"wonderful company. I would like to just quote and quote.\\" Schjeldahl, Peter. Three Poets. The Week in Review. New York Times. 17 December 1978 Glaze's first poetry book, Damned Ugly Children was published in 1966. The book was well received in a review in The New York Times by Richard Eberhart, \\"...Glaze's poems are refreshing in the intellectual health they show ... He possesses a true richness of psychic perception\\". That same year the American Library Association named the book, \\"One of the most notable books of 1966\\". On the wave of this acclaim, Glaze was invited to participate in the 1967 Morris Gray Lecture Series at Harvard, and to sign their historic Morris Gray Lecture Signature Book. A few months later, in June 1968, Robert Mazzocco reviewed the book, together with one by poet Robert Bly, in The New York Review of Books. The header for the dual review was \\"Jeremiads at Half-Mast\\". The following summer of 1969, Glaze returned to the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, this time as a guest faculty member. In 1974, with the assistance of producer Joseph Papp, Glaze had a play, Kleinhoff Demonstrates tonight, produced at the Cricket Theatre in Minneapolis. Seven theatre groups performed the play between 1971‚Äî1988, and The Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival did a production with the rock star, Meat Loaf, in a leading role. A second play, The Man-Tree, had a staged reading in 1974 by Joseph Papp's The Public Theater. Two years later, The American Repertory Company of London, performed Glaze's play The Man-Tree in London. Glaze's book I Am The Jefferson County Courthouse appeared in 1981 and was published and chosen by Library Journal as one of the best small press titles of that year. In the title poem, Glaze describes a busy Southern courthouse of the 1950s; and compares the Prosecutor to a bull frog on a lillypad, addressing a pond of \\"obedient\\" followers who wait for a signal \\"to sing\\". Two of his plays were produced in 1983, Love is Nothing to Laugh At and Uneasy Lies. The latter was reviewed in the New York Post by William Raidy. Between 1988‚Äì2002, Glaze prepared four new books of poetry for publication. The first to be published, in 1991, was Reality Street. In 1997, the second, a collection of Glaze's poems titled Carnal Blessings was a finalist for the T.S. Eliot poetry prize. A third book of poems went to print in 1998 with the title, Someone Will Go On Owing, selected poems, 1966‚Äì1992, and won the SIBA Award. In 2002, the fourth book, Remembering Thunder was released, after which Glaze and his wife moved to his hometown of Birmingham, Alabama. This time Maxine Kumin commented, \\"His original and unsettling voice makes these poems a real triumph\\". Once he'd resettled in Birmingham, Glaze continued to write, and in 2004 his book Andrew Glaze: Greatest Hits 1964‚Äì2004 was published. In 2012 the Alabama Writers' Conclave announced Glaze's appointment as the 11th Poet Laureate of Alabama, beginning in 2013. On November 5, 2012, he was officially commissioned by the Governor of Alabama in a ceremony at the State Capitol building in Montgomery. On June 8, 2015, Glaze was an inaugural inductee into the Alabama Writer's Hall of Fame, along with Helen Keller, Harper Lee, and nine other writers with roots in Alabama. In August 2015, his ninth book of poetry, a collection of previously unpublished poems titled Overheard in a Drugstore and other poems was released by NewSouth Books.

Written in 1902, it was first published in Harper's Weekly, Nov. 8 1902Harper's Weekly, Volume 46, Nov. 8 1902, page 1649. The first book publication was in his Time's Laughingstocks and Other Verses (London: Macmillan, 1909). Overview \\"The Man He Killed\\" dramatizes a battle scene between two men. The short poem begins when an unnamed character faces his foe. He deals with an internal struggle as his thoughts are regretful before he even shoots. The narrator muses that, in a different context, he would have befriended the combatant. Nevertheless, he kills the man and attempts to reassure himself by explaining the reasons for shooting him. In the end, he has no real justifiable reason and wonders at how \\"quaint and curious war is\\" to make one kill a man as easily as becoming friends at an inn. Analysis=Poetic structure The poem is made up of short lines using a simple rhyme scheme and everyday language. These format choices make the poem almost like a nursery rhyme in its simplicity, providing an ironic contrast to its unpleasant subject. The heavy irony of terms compared to the events narrated in the poem contrast in purposeful ways that emphasize the senselessness of how war seems. The poem's form is a dramatic monologue in the voice of a returned soldier. There are five stanzas with four lines, following a regular metre and an ABAB rhyme scheme in each stanza. The first, second and last line of each verse is about six syllables long. and the third line is a little longer with eight syllables. This gives the poem a sort of conversational tone, setting up the scene and portraying the dark themes of the poem. The rhyme allows the description to have a surreal quality and brings forth a dreamlike state of the soldier's mind. When the speakers start to think in the next stanza, the meter stays regular but the feeling changes dramatically with the repetition of words, the awkward pauses within the lines, the internal rhyme and the way when it ends with the word although. The soldier is confused and repeating the word at the end leaving the soldier in pieces. Critical interpretation The poem was written at the time of the second Boer War (1899-1902). The poem considers the irrational situation of war, and diminishing patriotic motives of the soldiers that meet one another on the battlefield. By giving his readers the perspective of an ordinary man‚Äôs life and experience, Hardy asked broader questions about the purpose of war in general. Hardy's own class origins were visible in this poem; where his own parents were from the middle and lower class, so that even as a rich and successful novelist, he could put himself in the perspective of ordinary people. Such as where the man in poem ponders about the motives of war. Also during this time Hardy and his wife, Emma, did not approve of the South African War like many other liberals- it gave Hardy doubts about the British Empire. To him, it seemed like the Boers were only defending their homes and land against the English. Overall, it made him question the purpose of killing others for the sake of war. Hardy's poem reintroduces many war themes and has many similarities with other poems he has written. He reintroduces war scenarios such as the feeling of guilt and being immobilized by a feeling. He also describes and observes characters in close detail, which is consistent with many of his previous poems. This somber poem expresses the internal battles that soldiers face, particularly the regret he faces on a battle field. \\"The Man He Killed\\" has been interpreted and interchanged with the title \\"The Many He Killed\\" as the author attempts to make a point that this scenario happens frequently with soldiers. Soldiers progressively begin to have a harder time summoning the it-could-have-been-me scenarios of fate that have traditionally provided a warrior's haunted but honorable bottom-line consolation. Hardy argues this and emphasizes the fact that things could have been different in multiple ways throughout the poem. \\"The Man He Killed\\" was one of several Hardy poems about war inspired by the Boer War and World War I. Others include \\"After the War\\", \\"The Eye of Waterloo\\", and \\"Drummer Hodge\\". His book Moments of Vision includes an entire section labeled \\"Poems of War and Patriotism\\".Patil, Mallikarjun. Thomas Hardy, The Poet: A Critical Study.

Civil Military Relations, State Strategies & Presidential Elections in Iran. Conflict Studies Research Centre, Middle East Series, June 2005: p.12.Rasmus C. Elling. State of Mind, State of Order: Reactions to Ethnic Unrest in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Wiley publishing . Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism Volume 8, Issue 3, pages 481‚Äì501, December 2008. \\"...The first, which will be called the Ahvaz unrest, took place in the south-western Iranian province of Khuzestan, which borders Iraq, and in particular in the regional capital of Ahvaz...\\" or 15 April Ahvaz Protests \\"On 15 April, protests in Ahwaz followed the publication of a letter...\\" were violent riots, initiated by Iranian Arabs in the city of Ahvaz in southwestern Iranian province of Khuzestan. The unrest erupted on 15 April 2005, and lasted for 4 days. Initially, the Iranian Interior Ministry stated that only one person had been killed, however an official at a hospital in Ahvaz said that there were between 15 and 20 mortal casualties. Government officials blamed the unrest on Britain, whose troops based just across the border in southern Iraq. Following the unrest, several bombings were carried out in Ahvaz, killing 28 people. In 2006, Iran executed five Arab separatists, convicted of carrying out the bombings in 2005. Background Before the Iran-Iraq war in 1980s, Arab people in Khuzestan largely lived a nomadic life style and resided in rural regions along the Karkhe and Karun rivers in the south west of the province; and the number of those living in cities was very limited. But after the war, Arabs refugees were stationed by the government in some urban regions and small towns. This conversion of lifestyle from nomadic to settled life caused many problem and conflicts in the structure of their societies - and ultimately led to unrest. The Arabs of Iran are concentrated in the province of Khuzestan and number between half a million to 2 million.J. Lorentz, 1995, p.172. These Arabs are descendants of Shi'ite Arab tribes gradually migrating to Iran since 16th (During Ottomon sovereignty on Arabian peninsula). Most Iranian Arabs are Shi'a, but a small minority of Sunni Muslim Arabs live along the Persian Gulf coastline.Nikki R. Keddie, \\"Iran and the Muslim World: Resistance and Revolution\\", New York University Press, 1995 (3/5/09). pp. 12‚Äì13: \\"Many writings state that the Arabs are Sunni, but the only bases for this assertion seem to be that most Arabs in the world are Sunni, that some Arabs in Khuzestan learly are Sunni, and the Shi‚Äôa Arabs follow some customs that Persians associate with Sunnism. In the absence of scholarly work or census surveys, it is impossible to estimate the percentages of Shi‚Äôas and Sunnis among the Arabs, but the evidence suggests that the great majority of Iranian Arabs are Shi‚Äôite. First, the Arabs border on a part of Iraq that is, and has long been, almost entirely Shi‚Äôite, and it would be surprising to find a Sunni pocket in such an area, especially since, second, they live in the Shi'ite state of Iran.\\" In Khuzestan, Arabs are the dominant ethnic group in Shadegan, Hoveyzeh and Susangerd, a majority in Mahshahr and Khorramshahr, a minority in Abadan and together with Persians, Arabs are one of the two main ethnic groups in Ahvaz.Iran Overview from British Home Office The Constitution of Iran guarantees freedom of cultural expression and linguistic diversity. Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province has radio and television stations in Arabic. School education is in Persian, the official language, but use of Arabic is allowed under the constitution of the Islamic Republic. Article 15 of the constitution states: However, some human rights groups have accused the Iranian government of discrimination and other human rights violations against Iranian Arabs and violating the constitutional guarantees of equality. Amnesty International says: According to the US Department of State: According to Article 16 of Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Arabic is taught in all classes of secondary school and in all areas of study including universities.Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran Causes A forged letter attributed to Mohammad-Ali Abtahi, an adviser to Iran's Reormist President Mohammad Khatami, began circulating on the blogosphere, and was widely circulated by hand and subsequently cited in a report by al-Jazeera network. The fake letter proposed measures to reduce the proportion of Arabs in Khuzestan. The letter inspired crowds of young Arab rioters to attack government buildings and institutions in Ahvaz city. Some Iran experts and analysts at the time speculated that the move was part of a plan by the conservative establishment to discredit the reformist camp among Arabs in the run-up to the 2005 presidential poll. Casualties The Iranian Interior Ministry stated that only one person had been killed, while an official at a hospital in Ahvaz said that between 15 and 20 mortal casualties. Another government official said clashes with security services resulted in 3 or 4 deaths. A spokesman for the Ahvaz Arab People Democratic Popular Front, Abu Shaker al-Ahwazi, mentioned the names of 20 people who he said had been killed in the clashes. He said that \\"dozens of people had been wounded and 300 others had been arrested.\\" Amnesty International has cited \\"unconfirmed reports\\" that 29 people were killed. Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported at least 50 deaths. News reports and accounts have put the number of fatal casualties at between 5 and 20. \\"The revolution is meant to commemorate Bloody Friday, when more than 20 Arab-Iranians were killed, 500 injured, and 250 arrested on 15 April 2005 during protests in the city of Ahwaz.\\" Aftermath The Iranian government officials blamed the Khuzestan unrest on UK, which hosts the headquarters of the Iranian Arab militant group \\"Al-Ahwaz Arab Peoples Democratic Popular Front\\". The government also temporarily banned broadcasts by the Arabic- language satellite-television station Al-Jazeera, accusing it of fanning the unrest. Ali Yunesi, the intelligence minister at the time, said those arrested in Khuzestan were mainly \\"young, innocent people\\" who had been provoked by \\"real criminals\\". Defense Minister at the time ‚Äì Ali Shamkhani, who is an ethnic Arab, was dispatched by the Reformist Government of Khatami, to the Ahvaz area to look into the reasons behind the unrest. He met with local leaders, and he stressed that ethnic Arabs are an integral part of the country but acknowledged that Khuzestan Province suffers from \\"underdevelopment\\". Following the riots, in June 2005 four bombings by Arab separatist militants in Ahvaz and two others in Tehran killed 10 people and injured at least 90. Two other bombings in Ahvaz, one in October 2005 and another in January 2005, killed 12 people. In 2006, Iran executed five Arab separatists convicted of carrying out the bombings in 2005. According to an April 2006 report by the Amnesty International, on 4 November 2005, during a Muslim feast celebrating the end of Ramadan, several hundred Iranian Arab demonstrators marched towards the centre of Ahvaz city, and were met by the security forces, who reportedly fired tear gas grenades into the crowd causing two youths to fall into the Karoun River and drown, apparently under the effects of the tear gas which caused temporary paralysis. Amnesty International has also stated that there were further clashes in Khuzestan between Iranian Arabs and the security forces on 11 and 12 January 2006, during the Muslim Feast of Sacrifice, which reportedly resulted in 3 deaths and 40 injured persons. The demonstrators were reportedly demanding \\"an end to Arab persecution, poverty and unemployment, and the release of political prisoners detained since April 2005\\". On 15 April 2011, there was a protest by the Sunni Arab minority in Ahvaz, to mark the sixth anniversary of the 2005 events. In a letter, written to the UN high commissioner for human rights, Iran's Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi stated that \\"more than 12 people were killed, around 20 injured and tens of protesters have been arrested.\\" See also *List of modern conflicts in the Middle East *Politics of Khuzestan Province References Category:2005 protests Category:April 2005 events in Asia Category:Arab rebellions Category:Protests in Iran Category:2005 riots Category:Political riots Category:2005 in Iran Category:Ahvaz Category:Khuzestan conflict Category:Human rights abuses in Iran Category:Ahwazi Arabs ","title":"2005 Ahvaz unrest"},{"id":"31611782","title":"1963 South Vietnamese parliamentary election"},{"id":"31611807","text":"thumb Steven Lugerner is an American San Francisco-based jazz and classical musician.

He played college football at USC, and was drafted by the San Diego Chargers in the third round of the 2011 NFL Draft. He has also played for the San Francisco 49ers, Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills, Oakland Raiders, and Houston Texans. Early years  Wright played football at Colton High School in Colton, California, where he was a star player. He had 68 tackles and 2 sacks in 2005, plus ran for 1,094 yards on 78 carries (14.1 avg.) with 16 TDs and caught 13 passes for 336 yards (25.8 avg.) with 4 TDs despite missing the first 2 games with a broken left hand. He also ran track at Colton, where he posted a best of 11.4 seconds in the 100-meter dash. College career Wright was a backup cornerback and key special teams player as a freshman in 2006, his first year at USC. Overall in 2006 while appearing in all 13 games, he had 15 tackles and 2 fumble recoveries (versus Arizona State and Stanford). Wright was used often as USC's nickel back and also played on special teams as a sophomore in 2007. Overall in 2007 while appearing in 11 games (all but Stanford and Arizona), he had 29 tackles, including 3.5 for losses of 26 yards (with an 8-yard sack), plus 4 deflections. Wright started USC's first 2 games (Virginia and Ohio State) of his 2008 junior season at cornerback and was productive, but then suffered a hairline fracture in his neck in practice prior to the Oregon State game and was sidelined the rest of the season. Wright was set to start at cornerback as a junior in 2009, but was ruled academically ineligible in 2009 fall camp and had to sit out the regular season. He regained his eligibility for the bowl game against Boston College and started that contest, getting 2 tackles and an interception (which set up a USC touchdown). He was limited in 2009 spring practice while recuperating from a neck injury. The 2010 season was the only one in which he was a full-time member of USC's secondary, as he started all games he played in and was voted a team captain. Professional career=San Diego Chargers2012 season= Wright had appeared on track for a big year in 2012 after appearing in just seven games as a rookie. He was coming off a solid preseason, one that included a performance against Dallas in which he had a 73-yard interception return, a sack and forced fumble, and two passes defensed. But on the first play of the Chargers‚Äô 2012 opener at Oakland, Wright hurt his foot while making a special teams tackle inside the 20 and it sent him to the sidelines for the rest of the night and for the next six games. Once healed, Wright played in each of the Chargers‚Äô last nine games, and he finished the year with 14 tackles on defense and seven on special teams. =2013 season= Wright was named starter opposite of newly acquired Derek Cox. Wright got off to a slow start, giving up 193 receiving yards to DeSean Jackson in week 2 win against the Philadelphia Eagles. Wright improved during San Diego's run toward the playoffs. In Week 14, Wright picked off New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning, returning it 41 yards for his first career interception. Wright played well against Peyton Manning and Denver's high powered offense, holding star receiver Demaryius Thomas to 4 receptions for 45 yards in a winning effort. Wright finished the regular season starting 13 games, collecting 56 tackles, 54 solo, 1 interception, and 9 passes defended. In the Wild Card round, Wright picked off Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton, returning it 30 yards, which set up a Nick Novak field goal. The game ended in San Diego winning 27-10. =2014 season= Wright headed into 2014 with more experience as a starter and would wound up playing 14 games, recording 60 total tackles (54 solo), and 10 passes defended. San Francisco 49ers2015 season= On March 14, 2015, Wright signed a one-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers. After being inactive for the first three games of the 2015 season, it announced that he was seeking a trade or his release from the 49ers. The 49ers granted his request by releasing him on October 10. Baltimore Ravens2015 season= Just a couple of days after Wright's release from the 49ers on October 13, 2015, the Ravens signed Wright after Will Davis suffered a season- ending ACL tear. =2016 season= On March 7, 2016, the Baltimore Ravens signed Wright to a three-year contract extension.

Personal life She was educated at Mount Anville Secondary School, Dublin, and at University College Cork. She lives in Collooney, County Sligo with her husband and three children. Journalism O'Keeffe is a journalist by profession. In 1995, when working on World in Action, she was threatened with prison in Ireland for refusing to reveal her sources. She had investigated scandals within the Irish meat industry in two films in 1991. The investigation centred on the Goodman International group ‚Äì involving tax fraud, misappropriation of beef and Larry Goodman's dealings with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, leading to the setting-up of a Tribunal of Inquiry, known as the Beef Tribunal, which found that much of her criticism of the industry was substantiated. However, the Tribunal demanded that she name her informants, and when she refused to do so, she was charged by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The case became a cause c√©l√®bre in Ireland, and, in January 1995, she faced trial for contempt of court but was cleared of the charge. She was honoured in the 1994 Freedom of Information Awards for her stand. Politics She was an unsuccessful candidate at the 2011 general election for the Sligo‚ÄìNorth Leitrim constituency, polling 4,553 first preference votes (10.2%). She was also a candidate in the 2009 European Parliament election for the North-West constituency. Her candidacy in the 2011 general election was not helped by the fact that three former members of the Labour Party stood against her. She was elected to the 24th Seanad in April 2011 by the Agricultural Panel. She was appointed whip of the Labour Senators in the Seanad. In May 2012, it was reported that she had the worst voting record amongst Labour Party Senators. A motion of no confidence in her was tabled by Senator John Whelan, although later withdrawn. It was reported in The Irish Times that \\"Ms O‚ÄôKeeffe is considered by her critics to be too close to the leadership and inclined to play along with the official Labour Party line of accepting Fine Gael's proposal to abolish the Upper House.\\" At the 2016 general election, she contested the Sligo‚ÄìLeitrim constituency. Her vote was 1,829 first preference votes.

History  Dmitrovskaya Tower is main tower of Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin A sheet of Russian definitive stamp showing Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin. The first attempt to replace the wooden fort with a stone kremlin was recorded in 1374, but construction was limited to a single tower, known as the Dmitrovskaya Tower (this has not survived). Under the rule of Ivan III, Nizhny Novgorod played the role of a guard city, having a permanent garrison; it served as a place for gathering troops for Moscow‚Äôs actions against the Khanate of Kazan. In order to strengthen the defenses of the city, construction works on the walls began again. Construction of the stone Kremlin of Nizhny Novgorod began in 1500 with the building of the Ivanovskaya Tower; the main work commenced in 1508 and by 1515 a grandiose building was completed. The oak walls that formed the old fortifications were destroyed by a huge fire in 1513. The two kilometer wall was reinforced by 13 towers (one of them ‚Äì Zachatskaya ‚Äì was on the shore of the Volga; not preserved, but was rebuilt in 2012). This ‚ÄúStone City‚Äù had a permanent garrison with solid artillery weapons. With the fall of Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin lost its military significance, and later it housed the city and provincial authorities. During the World War II, the roofs of the Taynitskaya, the Severnaya, and the Chasovaya Towers were dismantled and anti-aircraft machine guns were installed on the upper platforms. Thus, the fortress defended the airspace of the city from the Luftwaffe. The Luftwaffe bombed the Kanavinsky Bridge and the Fair, but the Kremlin's air defense defended these objects. The Council of Ministers of the RSFSR issued an order on January 30, 1949 for the restoration of the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.–°–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–ª–∞—Å—å V –ù–∏–∂–µ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–∞—è –º–µ–∂—Ä–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–æ–≤–µ–¥—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è ¬´–°–≤—è—Ç—ã–Ω–∏ –∑–µ–º–ª–∏ –ù–∏–∂–µ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–æ–π. –ù–∏–∂–µ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–∏–π –∫—Ä–µ–º–ª—å¬ª, Nizhny Novgorod diocese, 1 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 2009 –≥–æ–¥–∞ In October 2018, archaeologists discovered the remains of a medieval settlement and cemetery on the site of the destroyed church of St. Simeon Stylites.

It is the oldest surviving building in the Kremlin. The cathedral contains the tomb of Kuzma Minin. In 1828, an obelisk in honor of Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky was constructed in front of the Archangel Cathedral (architect Melnikov and Martos). The house of the military governor was built in 1837-1841; it is now the Museum of Art. The Arsenal was built in 1840-1843 at the direction of Nicholas I. In 1931, the Transfiguration Cathedral was replaced by the House of Soviets; that building is now the City Council building. Eternal Flame In 1965, a memorial complex in honor of Nizhny Novgorod citizens who died in World War II was created, near the obelisk of Minin and Pozharsky; this included an Eternal Flame.

Prior to its release, four preview stories appeared in Dark Horse Presents on MySpace from January to April, 2010. Book 1 was released in July 2010, Book 2 in January 2011, Book 3 in May 2012, Book 4 in April 2013, Book 5 in April 2014, and the final volume, Book 6, was released April 2015. Premise Brody lives in the slums of a city which time period is said to be slightly into the future where he is working a dead end job in a small one room apartment, he soon meets Talia the ghost who contracted leukemia. She explains that Brody has special psychic powers that makes him see ghosts, she then requests him to help her apprehend the penny murderer so she can pass on. The books follow the duo's investigations and Brody's training in martial arts and his psychic powers. Characters Brody- A young man who has given up on making any real effort in life, since being dumped by his girlfriend, Nicole. Brody is mostly a mellow guy, but he sometimes has a problem with his temper. One day he meets a ghost named Talia, who wants his help finding and apprehending a serial killer known as the Penny Murderer. Because he can see her, she believes he has untapped psychic powers that will allow him to hear \\"death echoes\\" at the scenes of the crimes. So, she introduces him to a ghost named Kagemura, who trains him to unlock his powers. He also gives Brody a weapon called the \\"kanazuchi\\" (a sort of Kanab≈ç). Talia- A girl who contracted leukemia at age 16, and apparently died soon after. For some reason, she has been locked out of heaven until she can identify and apprehend the Penny Murderer, or at least, that's what she tells Brody when she first meets him. But she has kept many secrets. She cannot physically interact with the material world, though she says every ghost has one specific way they can do so. Her thing is breaking glass. Because she can't catch the killer herself, she needs the assistance of someone living. She spent her first five years as a ghost looking for someone who could see her, and Brody was the first ghost-seer she encountered. So, in spite of his initial reluctance to get involved, she refused to take \\"no\\" for an answer. After she saved him from a street gang called the L47s, he agreed to let her introduce him to Kagemura. Kagemura- An ancient samurai ghost, who is a site spectre: a ghost attached to a specific location; in his case, Shinshoji Temple. Kagemura has his own reasons for agreeing to train Brody, and has no interest in Talia's reasons. While he trains Brody to unlock his psychic powers (or \\"Greater Senses\\"), five demighosts who work for Kagemura train Brody in various styles of combat. Nicole- Brody's ex-girlfriend, a waitress at a swanky restaurant called Arturo's. Gabriel- Brody's only friend, whom he describes as one of the few honest cops. The penny murderer- The mysterious serial killer who targets young women and kills them via strangulation, their namesake is based on their calling card (crime) of leaving a penny on the victims forehead. Demighosts Kyo- a large, muscular ghost whose combat style is brute strength. Soku- a ghost with long, pointed limbs, whose combat style is speed. Chi- the most humanoid of the demighosts, whose combat style is about strategy and intellect. Ran- a flat-bodied ghost with elongated limbs and no head, whose combat style is chaotic and unpredictable. Gi- a small ghost with a round body and several short, pointed limbs, whose combat style is deceit.

The film premiered at various film festivals in 2005 but had a limited release across theatres in 2008.http://www.lakshmansruthi.com/cineprofiles/english%20Films/2008.asp Later, Zee Tamizh telecasted this film. The film received critical praise and won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil.\\"Winners of national awards do Tamil film industry and Chennai proud\\" Plot The film unfolds from the life of college student Manimekhala (Navya Nair), a village girl who can see what others don't. A serious reader of modern literature from a southern district of Tamil Nadu, Manimekhala sees visions that no one believes. Later, incidents prove that what she says become true. She creates scenes whenever she has these illusions. The illusions are like a movie projected on an imaginary screen from her bangle presented by her fianc√© Muthu (Aari). The bangle is actually made from molten celluloid. This projected movie roughly reveals the story of a couple of street performers in love and tortured by a lustful Zamindar (Prakash Raj), who tonsures the girl's head. Even on the marriage stage, her bangle projects such a show specially for her, and she creates a scene ending in the cancellation of the marriage ceremony. Later, Muthu accompanies her to investigate what really happens. It leads to an old retired schoolmaster, who narrates the story of the dropped movie. In the later 1970s, this movie was actually made by an enthusiastic young director Gnanasekaran (Cheran), and dropped midway due to a mishap. This retired man was enacting the role of the Zamindar in the film, and the plot was based on a real incident. The heroine is at first reluctant, when the director/hero tells her that her head will be really shaved and no special effects business. After persuasion, she agrees for the sake of reality. Meanwhile, the real Zamindar's son (Seeman) comes to the shooting spot and objects, stating that the real incident maligning his dad should not be canned. The master pacifies him saying that it is only an imaginary plot. But the Zamindar's son returns with his bunch of hooligans and creates havoc in the shooting spot. The tonsured heroine is mentally disturbed and hangs herself, and the shooting comes to a halt. The director disappears, only to return as a Naxalite to annihilate the wicked Zamindar along with his unshaved revolutionary comrades. But he is encountered by the cops and shot down, and the period was the Emergency. Manimekhala suddenly wields a camera and becomes a docu film maker and goes to the particular village again. There she meets the real Dalit woman (Manorama), who was tonsured during the Zamindar's period, and interviews her. And she repeats the dialogues prompted by Manimekhala with a theatrical accent and a huge white wig. The Zamindar's grandson (Seeman) is also interviewed.

All of the brewery's waste is delivered to a family-owned farm in Haymarket, Virginia, where it is converted into animal feed and composting material. DC Brau also supported a bill before the Washington City Council that would allow on-site beer tasting at breweries within the city's limits. D.C. law previously only allowed on-site tastings at grocery stores and retailers that do not manufacture beer at the same location, prohibiting the brewery itself from opening a tasting room. DC Brau now offers tastings, pints, and growler fills, as well as free brewery tours.

The phone also has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and TV-out (HDMI 1.3) connectivity. The Samsung C110 processor enables the Meizu M9 to play full HD video. There is also an English version of the phone's software. The M9 was launched on January 1, 2011, resulting in buyers lining up overnight to enter the stores to purchase the device. History Jack Wong, at that time the CEO of Meizu announced that the Meizu M9 would be released in late 2010. Only 300 copies of the phone were released on the first day of the phone's launch. It was only available in December 2010 if it was pre-ordered in October. The price of the Meizu M9 was set for 2380 Yuan (350 dollars). The phone was originally slated for release in early November. Because of several delays, the phone's release date was delayed to late December. One of the delays in the release of the phone was the company's decision to brand the phone with an ancient Chinese character for a logo. Another delay was caused by the validation process of the phone by the China Academy of Telecommunication Research. The validation process took two months. Another delay was caused by the arrival of the IPhone 4 to China. Because Meizu Technology Co., ltd wanted to compete with Apple, the company had to use the same retina screen as the iPhone 4. Software=Internal hardware The Meizu M9 runs on a 1 GHz CPU, Power VR 540 GPU and 512 MB of RAM. The Meizu M9 is similar to the iPhone 4 in a number of ways. They both have similar CPUs which are ARM Cortex A8-based. The difference is that the Meizu M9 has the Samsung S5PC1110 application processor rather than the Apple A4 application processor. Even the clock speed and phone internals are similar between the Meizu M9 and the Apple iPhone 4. Display The Meizu M9 uses a 3.5 inch Sharp AVS display with a 960x640 resolution. This offers a pixel density of 326ppi, a substantial improvement over most Android phones and a pixel density identical to that of the Apple iPhone 4. Because of the improved pixel density, text in zoomed-out views of the web browser or other applications can be read, and graphics such as those of games appear sharper. Android operating system and Meizu software The Meizu M9 runs on Android 2.2, with an upgrade to 2.3 afterwards. With Android 2.2, there is some lag but that is fixed with the new 2.3 update with performance updates. The interface is designed by Eico. Eico is a Chinese design firm that has a good reputation because of its good work with Google, ASUS and Creative. Eico have designed a unique user interface for the Meizu M9. A lot of people that have HTC cell phones have started importing the Meizu M9 interface into their cell phones because of its layout. The Meizu also has its own apps that have been designed by Eic which are designed to work well with the interface. The Flyme OS from the new MX device was backported to M9, with a few features disabled. Giving it Android 4.0 support, increased performance and a new UI. Usability Meizu M9 has three physical buttons below the screen. The middle button is the ‚ÄúHOME‚Äù button; the ‚ÄúBACK‚Äù button is on the left and the ‚ÄúKEY‚Äù button on the right. On the top of the phone is the ‚ÄúLOCK SCREEN‚Äù key and on the left side is the ‚ÄúVOLUME‚Äù key. Meizu M9 does not have a physical button on the sides for taking pictures which leaves the right side of the phone without push buttons. The Meizu M9 screen will appear with 3 icons on its lockscreen after turning on the phone. There is a ‚ÄúLOCK‚Äù icon in the middle which opens the Home screen, a \\"PHONE\\" icon on the left, and a \\"SMS\\" icon (for text messages) on the right. These icons can be activated by dragging them upwards. Phone calls After dragging the phone icon up to unlock the phone a dial pad will appear; this gives the user both the flexibility to dial and access contacts. After dialing one can choose to put the call on speaker, mute, hold, and record, check contacts list or end the call by pressing the orange box at the bottom. All this commands appear on the screen during the time of the phone call. Text To write a text message first press the ‚ÄúTYPE TO COMPOSE‚Äù button and the keyboard will appear. The main difference with Meizu M9 from most smartphones like iPhones is that the keyboard does not rotate to landscape mode when the phone is reoriented. Also it can easily switch from Chinese to English and vice versa simply by pushing the ‚ÄúEN‚Äù and ‚ÄúCH‚Äù buttons respectively. Internet browsing Upon pushing the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button on the middle of the screen, the user is immediately connected to the default homepage of the Meizu web browser. The top left button on the screen allows the opening of more than one internet page at the same time. Also at the bottom of the page there are three icons: on the left is the ‚ÄúRefresh‚Äù icon on the middle ‚ÄúBookmark‚Äù button and on the right is the ‚ÄúMore Options‚Äù icon, which allows the user to download list, add to desktop, select text etc. The screen can scroll up, down, left, right and also zoom in and out with just the touch of the finger making it easier to read. Criticism=Functionality The Meizu M9 uses a 5MP front-illuminated digital camera sensor which has poor low-light capability. The sound quality is known to be quite cacophonic, especially when the volume is increased to its maximum. Critics have stated that the storage ROM for the phone isn't stable enough for full customer reliability. Battery life The battery life span of the Meizu M9 is comparable to that of most modern smartphones. When fully charged, it can last up to a day with normal usage, and it can last up to two days with minimal usage. There is speculation that the Android 2.3 update will improve the Meizu M9's battery life. With the Android 2.3 beta firmware, battery life can last up to two days with normal usage and three days with minimal usage. These durations are expected to be higher for the final firmware version. Marketability Unless one is in China, getting access to the Meizu M9 can prove to be quite an arduous task. The best way to purchase one of these phones is to get it from an online seller; the downside to this is that a warranty is not available and the sellers may be unreliable. The Meizu M9 was reported to have already hit its total sales target for 2011 in the first quarter. Consequently, the CEO Jack Wong refused to reduce the price of the phone. Its success could be as a result of low project target sales or unexpected popularity of the product. This phone is highly popular in China, and is starting to gain worldwide attention.

It is not uncommon to find his story confused with that of Fu·∏çayl Ibn Yahya, a contemporary who was the vizier to Harun al- Rashid.Hagiography in Tazkirat al-AwliyƒÅ, Attar of Nishapur Early life and banditry A number of birthplaces have been attributed to Fu·∏çayl, including Samarkand, Merv, Mosul and Balkh; meaning he could be identified as a Turkomen, Iraqi , Azeri etc.Politics and society during the early medieval period: collected works of Professor Mohammad Habib, Volume 1 Prior to his conversion, Fu·∏çayl led a group of bandits, or highwayman, in Syria and Khorasan, raiding caravans and robbing travelers. Even during this time, he was a Muslim, keeping his five daily salat prayers, fasting as required and forbidding his men to uncover any women found among the victims. During this time, he was deeply in love with a woman, and would often send her tokens from his stolen treasures.:: Hazrat Abdul Fu·∏çayl Ibn Iyad (rahmatullah alayh) :: One story of his banditry has a rich merchant, fearful of running into bandits, mistake Fu·∏çayl for an honest man and ask him to hide the majority of his wealth lest bandits find him. As the merchant continued on his way, he was robbed of his remaining wealth by Fu·∏çayl's men. When the merchant returned to Fu·∏çayl to recover the majority of his wealth, he was dismayed to find the bandits who had robbed him there surrounding the man he had trusted; however Fu·∏çayl indicated that he was a god-fearing man, and would not betray his trust, therefore motioning the merchant to reclaim the wealth he had left in trust with him. Fu·∏çayl was climbing a wall simply watching a passing caravan; when Fu·∏çayl heard someone reciting the Quranic chapter of Al-Hadid, and when he heard 57:16, which reads \\"Has not the Time arrived for the Believers that their hearts in all humility should engage in the remembrance of Allah and of the Truth which has been revealed (to them), and that they should not become like those to whom was given Revelation aforetime, but long ages passed over them and their hearts grew hard? For many among them are rebellious transgressors\\", he realised that he was a hypocrite to claim both submission to God, and banditry.Muwaqif Mushriqah fi Hayatis Salaf With his new found piety, Fu·∏çayl left his criminal ways and wandered through the desert where he found a caravan camping - and overheard two men warning each other to be wary lest the bandit Fu·∏çayl ibn Iyad find them. Fu·∏çayl stepped out and introduced himself, acknowledging that he had repented and was no longer a danger.How to Win Your Wife's Heart. Ibrahim Ibn Saaleh al-Mahmud After this, Fu·∏çayl tried to visit each of his known victims to repay them what he had stolen from them, and when he ran out of available goods, he visited them to beg their forgiveness. However one Jew refused to forgive him until he had been repaid, and ordered Fu·∏çayl to move a pile of dirt in front of his house to work off his debt. After several days of work, a hurricane blew away the pile of dirt, and Fu·∏çayl explained to the Jew that God had aided him. The Jew then placed a bag of dirt on his bed and asked Fu·∏çayl to bring it to him, and remarked upon discovering that the dirt had turned to gold that he now believed in the religion of Fu·∏çayl, and asked to become a Muslim.Jawami'ut Hika'at, Volume I, Part I Later life After his conversion, Fu·∏çayl moved to Kufa, in modern- day Iraq, and studied under Ja'far al-Sadiq and Abdul Waahid Bin Zaid. and taught Ibrahim ibn Adham, Bishr the Barefoot and Sari Sakti. When Fu·∏çayl determined to make the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, he approached his wife and told her that he had to leave on the long and dangerous journey, but that he was willing to grant her a divorce if she wished to remarry in his absence. She refused, and said she would prefer to accompany him on the trip. He remained in Mecca for a long time, and studied under Abu Hanifa. He had at least one son, named Ali, and two daughters. Fu·∏çayl was noted for his anti- social nature, and many examples exist of this. When crowds began to gather around his Meccan home, eager for the chance to see him, he would often dissuade them, one time standing on his roof to thank them all and tell them that he prayed God would give them meaningful employment for their time. He was rather noted for his preference for solitude, at one point saying he wished he would become ill so that he did not have meet people and could avoid going out to public prayers. Another quote that survives from him is that \\"I am grateful to a man who does not greet me when he sees me and does not visit me when I am sick\\". Fu·∏çayl's son suffered from a urinary tract infection, which was cured when Fu·∏çayl relied on prayer and faith alone. When Fu·∏çayl understood that his death may be near, he told his wife to take his daughters to Mount Abu Qais, in Mecca, and tell God that Fu·∏çayl had cared for them all his life and now they were in God's hands. He died during his salat prayers, early in the year 187AH, with some scholars suggesting it was the third day of Rabi' al-awwal. Following his wishes, his widow took their two daughters to Mount Abu Qais, where they were greeted by the King of Yemen who was travelling with his two sons, and two marriages were thus arranged. A shrine was built in his honor in Bagdhad. See also * List of Sufis References *Fa al-Din Attar, trans.

Life  Kennington was born in Savannah, Georgia and lived most of her life in Dothan, Alabama. She received a B.A. in Art History and Design in 1956 from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. She also married her husband, Don Kennington, in the same year. In her early 40s she studied portraits because she wanted to have portraits of her children. She practiced by creating portraits of local children, developing a client list with the parents of her models. In the mid-1980s she gave up portraiture-for-hire work and moved to studio work. She has received numerous accolades and awards for her work. In 2009, she was recognized by the Alabama State Council on the Arts with the Governor's Arts Award, and the Alabama Bureau of Tourism and Travel as one of Alabama's \\"Master Artists\\". Works Her imagery is often of anonymous, passive individuals engaged in the banal, idle activities of everyday life: riding the subway, people watching or sitting at a bar. Kennington refers to these repetitive moments as rituals that contribute to the shared condition of humanity, ultimately elevating them to the status of myths. The settings of her paintings appear as sober theatrical stages into which anyone could recognize herself. Kennington later moved to painting folding screens after her husband's death. In these works she returned to her abstract roots, emphasizing shape and light and expanding upon the spatial complexities introduced in earlier series. Kennington's work is included in numerous public and private collections including the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, Montgomery, Alabama, the Columbus Museum of Art, Columbus, Georgia, the Wiregrass Museum of Art, Dothan, Alabama, and the Paul and Lulu Hilliard University Art Museum at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Louisiana.

It is a one-design racing keelboat recognized by the International Sailing Federation. Production It weighs 1,260 pounds and carries a 205-square-foot mainsail, a 100-square-foot roller furling jib and a 452-square-foot asymmetrical spinnaker. A deck-mounted retractable sprit makes it possible for a short- handed crew to safely use the spinnaker. It can be raised, jibed, and lowered by one person without leaving the cockpit. The relatively wide beam of eight feet, the flat planing hull and 450-pound bulb keel/daggerboard for ballast. The hull-deck joint folds outboard forming a three-inch lip that makes a great hand-hold when the boat is heeled over. That lip also doubles as a deflector for any spray that would normally find its way into the boat. The Ultimate 20 has had several builders since inception including: Ultimate Sailboats, Moore Sailboats, Abbott Boats Inc., and W. D. Schock Corp. Design The boat came about when Jeff Canepa headed a team that included Jim Antrim of Antrim Associates-Naval Architects, sail maker and Olympic medalist Jay Glaser, and 505 builder and foil specialist Larry Tuttle. The philosophy behind this boat can best be summed up by Jeff Canepa, president of Ultimate Sailboats International: \`\`Back in the late 1980s, we looked at the keelboat market and saw big, expensive sailboats that were long on cost and short on excitement. We discovered there was a large group of sailors looking for a boat that was fun, affordable, trailerable and easy to launch and sail. Operational history In 1995 the Ultimate 20 was named \\"Boat of the Year\\" by _Sailing World_ as a PHRF/Sportboat. A detailed boat review including the history of the design by _Practical Sailor_ : \\"Here's a 20-footer that goes 20 knots. Not only that, it's fairly easy to sail, too.\\" The W.D. Schock chapter continues the U20‚Äôs storied history. According to Corey, Ron Moore built the first 35 boats in Santa Cruz, then Santa Cruz Yachts built the next 20 or so, and Ultimate Sailboats International produced the bulk in the late 1990s before going bankrupt. After years of prototype testing, the U20 team achieved the perfect blend of size and simplicity, creating the ideal boat for racing ONE DESIGN, PHRF or any weekend sail about. The U20‚Äôs design offers exceptional craftsmanship that is reliable, safe, economical, and fun to sail.

Life Son of Owen Manning of Orlingbury, Northamptonshire, he was born there on 11 August 1721, and received his education at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1740, M.A. in 1744, and B.D. in 1753. While an undergraduate he nearly succumbed to smallpox. He was elected in 1741 to a fellowship which carried with it the living of St Botolph's Church, Cambridge. He retained both these positions until he married in 1755. He was chaplain to John Thomas, bishop of Lincoln, who collated him to the prebend of South Scarle in Lincoln Cathedral, 5 August 1757, and on 15 March 1760 to that of Milton Ecclesia, consisting of the impropriation and advowson of the church of Great Milton, Oxfordshire. In 1763 he was presented by Thomas Green, Dean of Salisbury, to the vicarage of Godalming, Surrey, where he lived till his death. In 1769, he was presented by Viscount Midleton to the rectory of Peper Harrow, an adjoining parish. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society 10 December 1767, and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1770. He died at Godalming on 9 September 1801. His parishioners placed a marble tablet to his memory in the church, and some private friends put an inscription on a headstone in the churchyard. Works He amassed materials for a history of Surrey, but he did not regard his collections as sufficiently complete for publication, and a total loss of sight prevented him from having them printed under his own care. The manuscripts were eventually entrusted to William Bray, who published them, with additions and a continuation of his own, for the benefit of Manning's widow. The work appeared under the title of The History and Antiquities of the County of Surrey, with a facsimile Copy of Domesday, engraved on thirteen Plates, three volumes, London, 1804‚Äì9‚Äì14. There appeared at London in 1819 The Ecclesiastical Topography of the County of Surrey, containing Views of Churches in that County (to illustrate Manning and Bray's History of Surrey), drawn by Hill and engraved by Peak.

History NFBA was first created in 2009 through an interlocal agreement between Baker, Bradford, Columbia, Dixie, Gilchrist, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lafayette, Levy, Madison, Putnam, Suwannee, Taylor, Union and Wakulla counties. The initial goal was to win a federal grant under the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and deploy a middle mile broadband transport network in underserved rural areas of Florida. NFBA applied for a $30 million grant through the program in August 2009, winning the grant in February 2010. Organization Florida law allows municipal governments to create a single entity through interlocal agreements. NFBA operates much like an independent utility, similar to a water, sewer or electrical utility. It is subject to government open records laws, and provide full accounting of expenditures to the federal government. Rural Area of Critical Economic Concern The NFBA geographic area is known as a Rural Area of Critical Economic Concern through Florida's Rural Economic Development Initiative, or REDI. Rural counties qualify for REDI with populations of less than 100,000 and exhibit low per capita income, low per capital taxable values, high unemployment or underemployment, and other poor economic factors. The designation is provided by the Governor's Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development, and are re-evaluated each year for REDI eligibility. Middle Mile Project When completed, the NFBA broadband project will deliver up to 1 Gbps capacity throughout the region, more than 600 times the current capacity available to public and private entities in the region. The system is being designed using microwave links, sending data wirelessly from one focused point to the next using existing cellular towers. This network, when commercial Internet service providers connect with it, will provide broadband Internet to approximately 154,000 households, 26,890 businesses, 1,570 critical facilities and 265 healthcare entities.

In winter bats live inside the rock. Furthermore, there live, for example, dormice, stags, deer, foxes and badgers.  History  Firstly, the Czech Rock was formerly called Sluneƒçn√° located on the eastern slope. In the 1980s there were punched two short exploratory tunnels in the Czech Rock massive. These tunnels were used to verify a stock of basalt for extraction. One of them is on the northeast edge of rock, directly under the peak and the other is about 80 metres south of the peak. In both cases it is a simple straight corridor without branching and it is a few tens of meters long. Nowadays, it is especially a winter habitat shelter for bats and both tunnels are closed by bars.  Other basalt formations  In the world there are other similar formations. Firstly, ' near the Czech Rock, which is known because of the Czech fairytale called ' (The Proud Princess). Secondly, Sheepeater Cliff in Yellowstone is a well-known basalt rock.

General Motors at the time said the car that showed futuristic capabilities was not practical because even if the solar cells ran at 100% efficiency they would only produce 12 horse-power, not enough to propel an average automobile of the time.Popular Science, October 1955, Vol. 167, No. 4, ISSN 0161-7370, Published by Bonnier Corporation Cobb showed and introduced the field of photovoltaics to a car show that had over 2,000,000 visitors. At the time all automobiles were run by gasoline engines. Cobb's Sunmobile model had 12 selenium photoelectric cells on top of a balsa wood body. These solar cells were connected in series-parallel and converted the sun light directly into electricity, which in turn ran a small low-inertia electric motor. The motor rotated at 2000 r.p.m. and ran on 1.5 volts. The motor's energy in turn was transferred to the model car's drive shaft, which then in turn transferred the energy through its rear axle by a pulley to the car's wheels which moved the car forward.Popular Mechanics, Feb 1957, Vol. 107, No. 2, p. 233, Published by Hearst Magazines, ISSN 0032-4558 The model car balsa wood body was in five sections. It had two center sections that were hollowed out to receive a pine chassis, the electric motor, and the drive mechanism. There were precision gears from the electric motor to the wheels. They had a 3 to 1 ratio, with the smallest gear on the motor and the larger gear on the drive mechanism that propelled the rear wheels. These gears were connected with a ladder-type chain connected to their sprockets. The rubber tires, obtained at a hobby shop, were one and a half inches in diameter. The rear axle was one- eighth inch in diameter. The wiring for the solar cells to the electric motor was by standard No. 20 insulated stranded copper wire.

It is found along the coasts of the western Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico from Norfolk, Virginia to Yucat√°n, including Cuba and the Bahamas. It is used in cooking and has a taste and texture similar to lobster. They get their name from their hard outer shell which is \\"hard as a rock\\".  Appearance  The rock shrimp is a deepwater cousin of the pink, brown and white Gulf shrimp species (Penaeus spp.). It appears off-white to pinkish in color with the back surface darker and blotched or barred with lighter shades. Their legs are red to reddish-purple and barred with white. The abdomen has deep transverse grooves and numerous nodules. Short hairs cover their bodies and appendages. Their eyes are large and deeply pigmented.  Biology  Brown rock shrimp's growth and development depends on factors such as water temperature and salinity. They can grow up to 6 inches in length, but most brown rock shrimp found in shallow waters are less than 2 inches long. They are highly productive and have a short life span, between 20 and 22 months. Females are able to reproduce when they reach at least 1/2 to 1 inch in length. Males mature when they reach about 1/2 inch long. Brown rock shrimp spawn year-round in offshore waters, with peaks between November and January. Individual females can spawn three or more times in one season. Males and females mate, and the eggs are fertilized when the female simultaneously releases egg and sperm. Eggs hatch within 24 hours. Juvenile and adult brown rock shrimp feed on the ocean floor, mainly eating small bivalve mollusks and crustaceans. Sheepshead, minnows, water boatmen, and insect larvae eat post-larval brown rock shrimp. A wide variety of species prey on juvenile and adult brown rock shrimp.  Habitat  Brown rock shrimp are found from Norfolk, Virginia, south through the Gulf of Mexico to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. They live and spawn in warm deep waters, 120 to 240 feet below the surface.  Management  NOAA Fisheries and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council manage the brown rock shrimp fishery. Managed under the Shrimp Fishery Management Plan: * Permit are required to harvest shrimp in federal waters. * Trip reports must be submitted for each fishing trip. * Observers must be carried aboard selected vessels to collect data on catch, bycatch, fishing effort, and fishing gear. * Managers set catch levels based on historic harvest amounts and fishing rates, rather than abundance, because brown rock shrimp are short- lived and heavily influenced by environmental factors. * Vessels are prohibited from trawling in certain areas off Florida to protect deep water coral habitat. To ensure compliance, brown rock shrimp vessels must carry vessel monitoring systems. Brown rock shrimp are occasionally caught in the Gulf of Mexico but not in quantities large enough to warrant specific management measures.  Status  According to the 2018 stock assessment, brown rock shrimp is not subject to overfishing. There is currently not enough information to determine the population size, so it is unknown. Brown rock shrimp are highly productive. Their population size varies naturally from year to year based on environmental conditions. NotesOther references * Rock shrimp NOAA FishWatch.

Description The track's site, set in an orchard, was donated to the society many years ago, and is east of the High Street, Harlington. The club has a large circuit of track of both and gauge incorporating a small tunnel, a clubhouse with kitchen and workshop, powered steaming bays and a brick built station and signal box. It has some resemblance to the Parkreisen of the BRD and the Pionerbahn of the DDR, though the facility is for the use of adult hobbyists and does not have the didactic purpose of training potential future railway employees. Service facilities are located in the centre of the western loop of the track. Locomotives are steamed there and then switched into the running line on a turntable. A facility for checking boiler pressure performance is located here. As early as the 1950s, the railway incorporated a treadle operated signalling system to regulate the traffic. The weight of the wheels operated the treadles, which caused the signal behind to change to red and being cleared to green at the next treadle along the line. Operation Besides a membership scheme it is frequently open to the public on the second and fourth Sundays of each month between April and October and trips are afforded for a relatively small charge. The route encircles the orchard, and is of a figure eight shape, though the arms of the \\"8\\" do not cross. Both and gauge locomotives can be run on the line, which is dual gauge. The passenger cars which straddle the line are of 5 in gauge. History The local area had many engineering companies (or companies employing engineers) including HMV, later EMI, the Aeolian Company's Factory and Fairey Aviation and the engineering facilities of Heathrow Airport are near at hand. These companies provided an extensive potential membership base that has provided a willing and expert membership. Most of the surrounding land has been developed as relatively low cost housing, and the HLS pays deference to the history of the local area, before urbanisation, one of market gardens and orchards, serving London, whilst finding a novel use as a leisure facility. Publicity Coverage in the specialist railway and children's press is longstanding, and Arthur Mee's Children's Newspaper carried a long article about the railway in the 1950s.

Discovering repressed incest While practicing as an attorney in 1983, Shari was asked by a mother to take on a child custody case where the mother thought her 3-year-old daughter was being sexually abused by her ex-husband. While she was questioning the ex-husband on the stand during cross-examination regarding the incest she began to scream and yell and lose control without understanding why. As the witness talked, Shari has claimed she became nauseated and sweaty. She has claimed that she kept hearing the sound of typing in the back of the courtroom, but no one was there. When the witness gave an excuse for touching his daughter's genitals, she screamed, \\"These men just get away with it!\\" and leapt into the witness box and tried to strangle him. The judge cited her for contempt, sent her to jail for two days and ordered her into therapy. It was in therapy that she has claimed that she remembered her own childhood molestation by her brother and her father, who was a writer. Shari's brother and father have denied her allegations and \\"after Louis Karney underwent a series of hypnotic regressions, clinical interviews and personality tests, licensed psychologist James J. Tschudy wrote in a Nov. 24, 1983, report that there was 'abundant and convincing evidence' that [Louis Karney] 'simply could not have engaged in any sexual act with his young daughter or any other child.'\\" In 1988, Karney stated that she ‚Äúnever actually sued [her] brother and father because [she doesn‚Äôt] need the money.\\" Incest survivor activism Shari began taking incest survivor cases helping the victims sue their families in civil court to win legal compensation in order to be reimbursed for therapy and other costs. When victims couldn't pay, Shari would finance the suits herself with income from her bar review course, Barwinners. However, Shari found it difficult to win these cases when the courts had a statute of limitations on victims of one year from their 18th birthday to sue. One problem is that incest survivors often were too young at 19 years old to have the means to bring suit. Also, some survivors, like Shari, had repressed the painful memories and did not remember them until they were older and the statute of limitations had run out. She decided she would have to change the law in order to get justice for these victims. Senate Bill 108 From 1985 until 1991 Shari, along with San Francisco attorney Mary R. Williams and California State Senator Bill Lockyer fought for passage of Senate Bill 108. During the Senate hearings, Shari testified to her own molestation by her father and brother. The California law, which amended California Civil Code section 340.1 and took effect Jan. 1, 1991 permits \\"delayed discovery\\" of childhood sexual abuse decades after that abuse has occurred. Under the new law the statute of limitations age has been raised to 26 years old. After age 26, a \\"delayed discovery\\" provision allows a person who has suppressed their emotional trauma to sue within three years of discovering the abuse. For example, a middle-aged person can now sue his or her elderly parent for sexual trauma caused at age 4, in the same manner as victims of other delayed-discovery injuries, such as asbestos poisoning. Six other states have also passed similar laws. Opposition Opponents of SB 108 included California Defense Council, an association of defense lawyers, many of whom are employed by insurers because an abuser's legal fees and some settlement costs would most likely be covered by homeowner insurance policies since most incest occurs in the home. Some psychologists and therapists of incest survivors see lawsuits as a last resort or capable of causing more damage because it cuts the victim off from the family or because the experience may even compound the victimization based on the difficult burden of proof in a court of law, and the often brutal experience of cross- examination by defense lawyers. Shattered Trust: The Shari Karney Story In 1991, NBC bought the rights to her story and developed a movie called Shattered Trust: The Shari Karney Story. The movie was released in 1993 as a television film directed by Bill Corcoran, written by Susan Nanus, and starring Melissa Gilbert. Television appearances In 1991 Shari appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Geraldo, Today, Home Show, Larry King Live, and ABC Primetime television programs to educate members of the public about their new legal rights under SB 108. From 2000-2001 Shari also appeared on the American syndicated TV \\"court show\\" Power of Attorney as one of the rotating high- profile attorneys. Barwinners In 1999, Karney created the California bar examination test preparation service Barwinners. In 2015 Barwinners, while under Karney's ownership, was the subject of a lawsuit for making false claims about its students' success rate. Karney's company claimed that Barwinners produced a 94% first-time bar passage rate and a 86%-87% passage rate for repeat test-takers, and had advertised the same passing rate over a long period, but the suit noted that the \\"actual pass rates for its students have been in the range of 38-63%.\\" \\"The action was brought under [The State of California's] Business and Professions Code ¬ß17200, for unfair competition, and ¬ß17500 of that code, for false advertising\\"; Barwinners did not admit wrongdoing but was ordered to pay a $20,000 fine and $110,000 in restitution to students who did not pass the bar exam. At the time of the settlement, the Metropolitan News-Enterprise reported that Shari L. Karney was also known as Karnosky and that Karney's current spouse, Leonard Ludovico, was not a member of the State Bar of California. Ludovico, a ‚Äúdog training expert and transpersonal hypnotherapist,‚Äù is listed as Barwinners‚Äô Bar Exam Study Facilitator.

Education and early career According to his obituary in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS), Epstein's years in middle school and high school were marked by ‚Äúillustrious academic achievements.‚Äù Graduating from the Bronx High School of Science in 1947, he applied at the age of 15 to Harvard, the University of Chicago, and the University of California, and was accepted to all three. He entered Harvard on a full scholarship at age 16. He graduated from Harvard in 1951 with a Bachelor of Science in Astronomy. He studied statistics at the Graduate School of Business Administration at Columbia University, and received an M.B.A. in 1953. During this period he participated in Columbia's Conservation of Human Resources Project. Career BAMS describes Epstein as having been ‚Äúassisted in his career choice by the U.S. government, which offered him the options of being drafted, entering Officer's Candidate School and becoming a naval supply officer, or attending Penn State as an air force officer and studying meteorology.‚Äù Until then, he had never heard of meteorology, but chose the latter because of his keen interest in science. He was in the Air Force from 1953 to 1957, and received a Master of Science degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1954. After attending the Officer's Basic Military Course at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas in 1954, he was assigned to do research under the auspices of the Air Force Cambridge Research Center. He then went to Flagstaff, Arizona, to determine the vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone. According to BAMS, the paper that resulted, ‚ÄúA New Method for Determining the Vertical Distribution of Ozone from a Ground Station,‚Äù ‚Äúestablished his reputation as a research scientist‚Äù and ‚Äúled to his being invited by Penn State to pursue a doctorate in meteorology.‚Äù He received a Ph.D. in meteorology from that institution in 1960. In the late 1950s Epstein worked at Arizona State University and then at Penn State. During this time he published two papers in 1959 about the power spectrum analysis of ozone and about vertical velocities in the lower stratosphere. University of Michigan From 1960 to 1973, Epstein was at the University of Michigan, first as a lecturer and research associate in meteorology; then as an assistant professor (1961‚Äì63), associate professor (1963‚Äì68), and full professor (1968‚Äì73). During his years at Michigan, the meteorology program, which was originally part of the Civil Engineering Department of the College of Engineering, grew by stages into the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences. Epstein played a critical role in this development, and was named chairman of the department in 1971. As head of the department, Epstein broadened its scope to include studies of aeronomy and planetary atmospheres. He was also a member of the College Standing Committee and the University Research Policies Committee. From 1962 to 1964, Epstein was also a scientific consultant to the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Science and Technology, focusing on international meteorological programs. During his years at Michigan, Epstein published many papers on probability forecasting, quality control, and forecast utility, some of them written with Allan Murphy. In 1962 Epstein published a paper in the Journal of Applied Meteorology entitled ‚ÄúA Bayesian Approach to Decision Making in Applied Meteorology.‚Äù This was ‚Äúthe first formal treatment of Bayes's theorem in meteorology,‚Äù according to BAMS. Another paper that involved Bayes's theorem was ‚ÄúQuality Control for Probability Forecasts,‚Äù in which, as Epstein explained in the abstract, he used Bayes' theorem to develop ‚Äúa method of quality control for probability forecasts.‚Äù Epstein's and Murphy's paper ‚ÄúA Note on Probability Forecasts and 'Hedging,'‚Äù published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology in 1967, ‚Äúintroduced the term 'proper' in connection with forecasts and scoring systems,‚Äù according to BAMS, which noted that new scoring systems ‚Äúare almost always subjected to this 'properness' test.‚Äù University of Stockholm Epstein spent the 1968‚Äì69 academic year at the University of Stockholm as a visiting scientist. While there, he wrote a pathbreaking paper, ‚ÄúStochastic Dynamic Prediction,‚Äù which appeared in the journal Tellus in 1969. The paper demonstrated, as he wrote in the abstract, ‚Äúhow the stochastic method can be used to assess the value of new or improved data by considering their influence on the decrease in the uncertainty of the forecast.‚Äù BAMS said that this paper was perhaps Epstein's ‚Äúmost profound scientific achievement,‚Äù adding that Epstein's ‚Äúconcept was so visionary that human and computer resources have not yet been able to capitalize fully on it.‚Äù He continued to work on this topic after returning to Michigan, where he published several related papers in collaboration with two of his students, Rex Fleming and Eric Pitcher. During his time in Stockholm, he also developed a ranked probability score that came to be widely used in forecast verification. Another important 1969 paper was ‚ÄúThe Role of Initial Uncertainties in Predictions,‚Äù published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology. In this paper, according to BAMS, Epstein ‚Äústudied the ensemble of forecasts made from a set of predictive equations with slightly differing initial conditions. While not the first to study this problem and use the term 'ensemble' in regard to weather prediction,‚Äù Epstein ‚Äúwas instrumental in setting the course for the many ensemble systems operational today.‚Äù ‚ÄúA Scoring System for Probability Forecasts,‚Äù published in the same journal in the same year, is described by BAMS as ‚Äúone of the cornerstones in evaluating probability forecasts of ordered variables.‚Äù NOAA In 1973 Epstein was appointed Associate Administrator for Environmental Monitoring and Prediction at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an agency of the Department of Commerce, in Washington, D.C. In announcing Epstein's appointment, Secretary of Commerce Frederick B. Dent said, ‚ÄúDr. Epstein's record of achievement in several major areas of science and administration is an impressive one, and I am pleased indeed at his acceptance of this position, one of considerable importance to the Department's environmental programs.‚Äù Epstein later served as the NOAA's Acting Assistant Administrator for Research and Development. During his years at the NOAA, according to BAMS, Epstein ‚Äúwas extremely supportive of the planning and execution of the GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) and the Global Weather Experiment, including the development of numerical models and global observing systems.‚Äù On November 3, 1978, in the wake of the passage of the National Climate Program Act of 1978, NOAA administrator Richard A. Frank announced the establishment of a National Climate Program, its purpose being ‚Äúto assist the nation and the world to understand and respond to natural and man-induced climate processes and their implications.‚Äù Epstein, who had ‚Äúhelped nurture the preparation‚Äù of the 1978 law, was named director of the National Climate Program Office. In that position, ‚Äúhe ensured that the fledgling Climate Analysis Center (CAC) in the National Weather Service would be given both research and operations missions, thus greatly enhancing its viability.‚Äù On May 5, 1981, it was announced that Epstein had been appointed director of the NOAA's Climate and Earth Sciences Laboratory. Climate Analysis Center In 1983 Epstein joined the National Weather Service's National Meteorological Center as chief scientist of the Climate Analysis Center, and it was there that he published his influential meteorological monograph \\"Statistical Inference and Prediction in Climatology: A Bayesian Approach.\\" Another important work published during this period was a 162-page NOAA Technical Report entitled ‚ÄúA Precipitation Climatology of 5-Day Periods‚Äù (1988). Epstein's paper ‚ÄúA Spectral Climatology‚Äù appeared in the first issue of The Journal of Climate, which began to be published by the American Meteorological Society (AMS) in 1988. In October1988, The Journal of Climate published a paper written by Epstein and A.G. Barnston, ‚ÄúA Precipitation Climatology of Five-Day Periods,‚Äù in which the authors, according to the abstract, develop a ‚Äúprecipitation climatology...for the relative frequencies of zero, one, or two or mere days with measurable precipitation within 5-day periods. The purpose of the climatology is to provide background for the development and introduction of extended-range (6- to 10-day forecast period) precipitation forecasts in terms of the probabilities of the three categories.‚Äù Epstein went on to publish several other papers in The Journal of Climate, including one about the optimum number of harmonics to represent normals and another about obtaining climatological values from monthly means. In 1988, Epstein also wrote a paper on long-range weather prediction for Weather and Forecasting. In 1989, Epstein and Murphy published an important paper in Monthly Weather Review entitled ‚ÄúSkill Scores and Correlation Coefficients in Model Verification.‚Äù An article in the Christian Science Monitor on January 25, 1985, reported on the possibility that climate was changing, and cited Epstein along with two NOAA colleagues, Thomas R. Karl and Robert E. Livezey, as having determined ‚Äúthat the past decade has had an abnormally high frequency of extreme winters -- six years out of eight between 1975 and 1983.‚Äù Epstein went on to publish a number of informal research papers which ‚Äúappeared as NMC office notes, in proceedings of climate diagnostic workshops, and in preprints of AMS conferences.‚Äù The papers ‚Äúfocused on removing systematic errors in numerical models, making objective 6- to 10-day forecasts of temperature and precipitation in probability form, and developing new statistical techniques such as the imperfect prog method and the Kalman filter (which he discussed yesterday at 5IMSC).‚Äù Retirement After retiring from the NOAA in 1993, he joined Murphy in forming a company, Prediction and Evaluation Systems. In his later years, Epstein suffered from Parkinson's disease. Although it eventually became debilitating, he remained active despite the disease for several years. He died on October 14, 2008, Potomac, Maryland. Affiliations Epstein was a Certified Consulting Meteorologist, a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society, Editor of the Journal of Applied Meteorology (1971‚Äì73), Associate Editor of the Journal of Geophysical Research, Associate Editor of The Journal of Climate (1988‚Äì94), a trustee of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, and Chairman of its Budget and Program Committee. He served on committees of the National Science Foundation and the National Academy of Sciences/National Academy of Engineering. He was also a member of the American Geophysical Union, the American Statistical Association, and the Royal Meteorological Society. He was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1978. He was chair of the Meteorological Statistics Committee of the AMS from 1967 to 1969, and was an AMS councilor from 1974 to 1977. Honors and awards Epstein won an award for outstanding achievement at the 1992 International Meeting on Statistical Climatology Personal life and attributes On presenting Epstein with the 1992 award, colleague William H. Klein called him ‚Äúone of the world's leading experts on statistical meteorology and climatology...an original thinker and a man of few words.‚Äù He added that Epstein was ‚Äúalso a great human being ‚Äì helpful, generous, honest, and unselfish.‚Äù BAMS's obituary of Epstein noted that at CAC, he ‚Äútreated his assistants as equals, wrote FORTRAN codes of startling economy and sophistication, applied them to projects of great practical value to CAC, and offered statistical advice and dryly humorous comments to all who asked. His combination of keenness and kindness are remembered affectionately by those who encountered him at CAC.‚Äù Epstein and his wife, Alice, had four children, Debra, Harry, Nancy, and Bill, and eight grandchildren. Epstein Symposium The American Meteorological Society held an Edward S. Epstein Symposium at its 2014 annual meeting. It was devoted to the ‚ÄúContributions of Dr. Edward S. Epstein to Scientific Endeavor.‚Äù The theme of the annual meeting was ‚ÄúExtreme Weather‚ÄîClimate and the Build Environment: New Perspectives Opportunities, and Tools,‚Äù a topic that the AMS describes as being ‚Äúmost relevant to the NOAA goal and the National Weather Service vision for 'A Weather-Ready Nation ‚Äì a society that is prepared for and responds to weather related events,' and to Dr. Epstein‚Äôs work as he was continually searching for better scientific understanding and better ways to harness science to improve our service to the nation.‚Äù References Category:American meteorologists Category:1931 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Harvard University alumni Category:University of Michigan faculty Category:Columbia Business School alumni Category:Fellows of the American Meteorological Society ","title":"Edward Epstein (meteorologist)"},{"id":"31612602","title":"Access Liberty"},{"id":"31612613","text":"The Wages of Fear is the second studio album by English indie rock band Tellison.

Shoemaker 2012), following Michel van Esbroeck, has argued in favour of Maximus' authorship of the Greek model for a Georgian 'Life of the Virgin'. This is improbable for various reasons both historical and theological. In short: first, the argument depends on the notion that Maximus spent some time in Constantinople in the period c.620-26, which lacks direct attestation; second, none of Maximus' characteristic preoccupations appear in the 'Life', and in turn none of the 'Life's central themes appear in the fleeting Marian reflections contained within his genuine corpus; third, there is no extant Greek manuscript which witnesses the text, in whole or in part; fourth, both admirers of Maximus (e.g. Sophronius, John of Damascus) and those who describe his works (e.g. Photius, Anastasius Bibliothecarius) show no knowledge of the 'Life'; and fifth, there is no witness to the existence of the entire 'Life' before the second half of the tenth century.

Bebb (1891‚Äì1986) (or M. R. Bebb as he signed his work) was a notable etcher and printmaker of the American Midwest, whose best-known subjects were birds native to Oklahoma and Minnesota, where he spent his time. Etching involves using copper plates on which an artist has etched or ‚Äúbitten‚Äù his picture with acid. Color etchings like Bebb's require two to four copper plates, each is inked with one or more different colors and printed one over the other to produce the finished picture. Technically, the process is called multi-plate soft-ground and aquatint etching.Oklahoma Today, Winter 1976-77. 1891 Bebb was born in Chicago in 1891. He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1913 and moved to Muskogee, Oklahoma, where he lived the rest of his life. By profession, he was a florist and had no formal art training. He established a florist business in Muskogee and married his first wife, Helen. In his early 50s, he began to draw, and later wrote a friend that he had always been an artist but didn‚Äôt realize it until later in life. He studied original prints from other artists and read technical manuals, then began working on copper plates around 1943. At that time he befriended and received encouragement from Charles M. Capps, Arthur W. Hall, Leon R. Pescheret, F. Leslie Thompson and other well-established printmakers of the time, most of whom had formal training and had studied color etching in Europe or with master printmakers. Charles M. Capps was a charter member of the Prairie Print Makers, a group Bebb later joined. 1951‚Äì1954 In 1951, Bebb retired from his florist business to devote himself full-time to his art. He traveled to Europe twice, once for eight months and a second time for six months, and took advantage of the long-standing presence of printmakers in Europe to secure copper plates, inks and other supplies. Bebb‚Äôs first etchings were exhibited in 1949 and he enjoyed instant success. The follow year he received the Purchase Prize of the Graphic Chemical Company at the Chicago Annual Exhibition.Catalog of the Chicago Society of Etchers, Forty-Second Annual Exhibition Chicago, IL, March 1953. The Print Makers Society of California selected his print Black Swans (1952) for their 1953 publication. His color etching of Yellow-Throated Warbler was chosen as the 44th presentation print and presented to associate members of the Chicago Society of Etchers in 1954. Then, in 1960, his print White-Breasted Nuthatch was selected for the thirtieth publication of the Prairie Print Makers. Nan Sheets, fellow artist and the first Oklahoman to be included in the annual publication of Who's Who in American Art, wrote, ‚ÄúIn Mr. Bebb we have an artist of recognition who pays attention to true perspective, clarity of design, rhythm of modulated line, and who is an expert draftsman...The Bebb pencil drawings are not quickly executed sketches but carefully considered works, with proper consideration of pencil technique...He excels not only because he is able to draw, but because he has mastered the various methods employed in making etchings. The fact that he has artistic ability to portray what he sees, and as simply as possible, places him high among his fellow artists‚Äù. 2011 In January 2011, students at Sadler Arts Academy in Muskogee, OK received a grant from The Kennedy Center to make a short film about Bebb.Cathy Spaulding Sadler Students Make Documentary, Muskogee Phoenix, January 13, 2010.

He was married to Kathleen Funchion, who is a Sinn F√©in TD for Carlow‚ÄìKilkenny. He became a member of Seanad √âireann in April 2011, sitting as a Senator for the Labour Panel. The Irish Times described him in the Seanad as \\"a frequent, informed and often abrasive contributor across a wide range of areas, with a keen attention to the nuances of legislation\\". He unsuccessfully contested the Waterford constituency at the 2002, 2007 and 2011 general elections, before winning a seat in 2016. He was re-elected in 2020, when his 20,596 first preference votes amounted to 1.95 quotas, and was the highest ever recorded in the constituency's history. Cullinane drew criticism on election night when a 30-second video uploaded to Twitter showed him ending his election victory speech with the phrases \\"up the Republic, Up the Ra and Tiocfaidh √°r l√°\\". When questioned about the appropriateness of using these phrases associated with support for the IRA, Cullinane stated: \\"Yesterday was a very emotional day for me . . . It was a long count and obviously we were very excited and very proud of the vote we got yesterday in Waterford. The 30-second clip was part of a longer speech that I gave where I was reflecting back on the hunger strikes, reflecting back on the fact that Kevin Lynch stood in the Waterford constituency in 1981. He was someone who inspired me and inspired I think many republicans. The comments were made in that context.\\"  See also  * Families in the Oireachtas ReferencesExternal links *David Cullinane's page on the Sinn F√©in website Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Waterford Institute of Technology Category:Local councillors in County Waterford Category:Members of the 24th Seanad Category:Members of the 32nd D√°il Category:Members of the 33rd D√°il Category:People from Waterford (city) Category:Sinn F√©in senators Category:Sinn F√©in TDs (post-1923) Category:Spouses of Irish politicians ","title":"David Cullinane"},{"id":"31612774","text":"Frances Reynolds (6 June 1729 - 1 November 1807 London) was a British artist, and the youngest sister of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Life She was born in 1729 and later kept Sir Joshua's house for many years after he came to London, and employed herself in miniature and other painting. But when her nieces, the Misses Palmer, were old enough to take her place, she (some point before 15 February 1779) left his house forever. The separation from her brother caused her lasting regret. Her brother made her an allowance, and she went first to Devon; and then, in 1768, to stay with a Miss Flint in Paris, where Reynolds visited her. She later lived as a lodger of Dr. John Hoole, whose portrait, prefixed to the first edition of his translation of Ariosto, was painted by her. On her brother's death in 1792 she took a large house in Queen's Square, Westminster, where she exhibited her own works, and where she died, unmarried, on 1 November 1807. Their other siblings included Mary Palmer and Elizabeth Johnson. Works Of her work, Sir Joshua, speaking of the copies which she made of his pictures, says ‚Äòthey make other people laugh and me cry;‚Äô but a letter of James Northcote's says that ‚Äòshe paints very fine, both history and portrait.‚Äô Samuel Johnson, who was very fond of her, and visited her in Dover Street, where she was living by herself in 1780, was not pleased with the portrait she made of himself in 1783, and called it his ‚Äògrimly ghost.‚Äô Of her literary work Johnson held a higher opinion, and he was complimentary about her ‚ÄòEssay on Taste‚Äô (privately printed, 1784). All his letters to her and about her show interest in his ‚ÄòRenny dear.‚Äô He left her a book as a legacy. She printed a ‚ÄòMelancholy Tale‚Äô in verse in 1790.

The most significant piece of reform legislation was passed in 1990, and was known as the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA). This act instituted six basic initiatives, some of the most important being a focus on core subjects, community service, and self-sufficiency. Kentucky education has seen improvements in terms of equalizing funding among various schools, but still has a long way to go in becoming nationally competitive in its educational outcomes and standardized test scores.Hoyt, William H. An Evaluation of the Kentucky Education Reform Act. http://cber.uky.edu/Downloads/kentucky_education_reform_act.htm .  Voluntary Charter Schools  One viable reform option that has gotten little attention is the possibility of voluntary charter schools, especially in areas of poor public school opportunities. The U.S. Department of Education defines charter schools as ‚Äútuition-free public schools freed from regulation in exchange for greater accountability.‚Äù Challenge and Opportunity: The Impact of Charter Schools on School Districts. US Department of Education. http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/choice/summary.html. In the charter school system, individual schools and administrations have more control over the structure of various curricula and school programs which provides for a more tailored emphasis for each student. And, by and large, students and parents felt that the students ‚Äú{received} more individualized attention at the charter school than they did at their previous school.‚Äù General Conclusions about Charter Schools. US Charter Schools. http://www.uscharterschools.org/pub/uscs_docs/fs/sped_natl_study.htm?page=10 These same parents said that they felt their students were able to learn more efficiently because teachers were more able to adapt their methods to fit the child‚Äôs individual learning style. Another benefit of charter schools is their effect on the competitiveness of the education market. Recent research conducted by the U.S. Department of Education proves that voluntary charter schools will provide greater educational choices and help to create a more competitive educational market that encourages all schools to improve.K-8 Charters: Closing the Achievement Gap. US Department of Education. http://www.uscharterschools.org/cs/fs/query/q/1829 . The Department of Education‚Äôs research shows that the creation and inclusion of charter schools in school systems led to visible improvements in the test scores and student behaviors of almost every school in that school system, whether they were public, private, charter, or anything else.Grove, Allen. AP Classes ‚Äì Why They Matter. College Admissions. http://collegeapps.about.com/od/apadvancedplacement/tp/ap-classes.htm.  Advanced Placement Classes  Voluntary charter schools certainly provide one aspect to bettering the educational system in Kentucky. But while charter schools benefit students by creating a more competitive educational marketplace, one still needs to consider how to institute reform that better prepares Kentucky students for post-secondary education, should they choose to pursue it. One of the ways that absolutely every school in Kentucky can improve its educational standards is with the greater inclusion of advanced placement (or AP) classes. Advanced placement classes are those with a higher degree of difficulty that seek to prepare high school students for post- secondary education. One college admissions website says that some of the reasons AP classes are important are because they impress college admissions offices, help better prepare students for college-level curriculum, and help students to make better decisions after high school.Switzer, Liz. Statistics show AP courses boost success. The Center of Gifted Studies, Western Kentucky University. The Daily News. http://www.b-g.k12.ky.us/districtNewsArticle.aspx?artID=477. With a proven record of helping to better prepare students for post-secondary education, AP classes are being discussed more and more by Kentucky high school teachers and administrators. This open dialogue about AP classes is extremely important as current data from Western Kentucky University‚Äôs Center of Gifted Studies reveal that ‚Äúcollege students who have not taken an AP course have only a 33 percent chance of completing a bachelor‚Äôs degree.‚Äù Croyle, William. Bill would give superintendents more say in principal hiring. NKYpolitics. http://cincinnati.com/blogs/nkypolitics/2011/03/02/bill-would-give- superintendents-more-say-in-principal-hiring/. But, that success rate increases exponentially with the inclusion of AP courses in Kentucky students‚Äô high school educations. The Center of Gifted Studies reports that ‚ÄúCollege students who have completed one AP course have a 59 percent chance of completing a four-year degree, while students with two or more AP courses under their belt have a 76 percent chance of completing a bachelor‚Äôs degree‚Äù (Switzer). Research institutes aren't the only entities supporting the greater inclusion of AP courses in high school curricula though; in fact, some of the biggest advocates for an increased number of AP courses are the teachers who would be charged with leading said classes. Vicki Schmitt, an AP English and literature teacher at Greenwood High School in Bowling Green, Kentucky, believes that AP courses are the very best way to prepare students for a college education (Switzer). On the benefits of AP classes for both the students and teachers, Schmitt said, ‚ÄúAP helps teachers teach kids how to think. Students tell me there was not a class in high school that prepared them for college except for their AP classes‚Äù (Switzer). At Greenwood High School, where Schmitt has taught for the past 12 years, there are currently 14 AP classes offered for students. However, that number is much higher than the vast majority of Kentucky schools, and there is much more work to be done to make Kentucky public schools look more like Greenwood High School. Based on the research provided and the opinions of many teachers like Schmitt, it seems that if more schools were to include AP options in their programs, Kentucky students would be more ready for post-secondary education, and become more successful members of society.  Greater Authority for Local School Superintendents  Another form of education reform that may require legislative action is the granting of greater authority to superintendents. One of the effects of the Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1990 was the creation of ‚Äúsite-based councils at each school . . . {which} generally consists of the principal, three teachers and two parents.‚Äù Senator David Williams on Education & Such. Updated: 12/9/2010. http://pageonekentucky.com/2010/12/09/senator-david-williams-on-education- such/. These site-based councils would be charged with the hiring of all new principals for whatever school it represented. But Wilson Sears, executive director of the Kentucky Association of School Superintendents, believes that KERA‚Äôs reliance on these site-based councils to hire principals is misplaced. Instead, Sears believes that superintendents should have the responsibility of hiring principals, and he has lobbied tirelessly for the recently passed Kentucky Senate Bill 12 which says that superintendents will temporarily replace fired principals and will also have a vote in choosing who the subsequent principal will be (Croyle). Like Sears, Campbell County Schools Superintendent Anthony Strong also thinks superintendents should have greater authority in personnel hiring. Strong says that the ‚Äúsuperintendent of a school district {is} similar to the CEO of a company, and . . . it would be unheard of for a CEO not to have input into who runs his or her company‚Äôs different divisions‚Äù (Croyle). Granting superintendents greater authority in choosing school principals is only one of the ways to increase autonomy at the local school board level. Another means of increasing local autonomy is to give principals and school administrators greater authority over the spending of instructional funds and resources. One 2011 Kentucky Gubernatorial candidate, David L. Williams, believes that local administrators should have greater ‚Äúinput on how to use the funds they are provided to ensure children are getting the best possible education.‚Äù Conklin, Kristin D. and Stephen Smith. Stronger Fiscal Incentives Can Improve High School and Postsecondary Options. NGA Center for Best Practices. www.nga.org/cda/files/0407HIGHSCHOOL.pdf. Williams‚Äô assertion that principals and local school administrators should have greater power in deciding how funds are spent is supported by research by the National Governors Association‚Äôs Center for Best Practices. NGA research proves that ‚ÄúPrincipals need discretion to direct resources in ways that match curriculum, instruction, and support services with students‚Äô identified needs.‚Äù This research also suggests that ‚Äúdecentralized budget authority is a contributing factor to school effectiveness,‚Äù primarily in high-performing, high-poverty schools (Conklin and Smith, 1). Bearing this research in mind, it seems as if granting greater authority to local school administrators in terms of personnel hiring and budget distribution may lead to a more successful Kentucky educational system for all.
