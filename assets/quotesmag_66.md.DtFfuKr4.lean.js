The older two got ahead of Half-Man and came to a river. An old woman asked for help across, but they said they did not have time. Half- Man came and helped her. She gave him a magic wand. He used it to get wood, and then to turn himself into a bourgeois. He went to speak to his father, who told him that he was poor, and that one of his sons was only half a man but he liked him better than the others. Half-Man took back his normal form and filled the pantry with things to eat. He went for a walk and saw the king's daughter. He used the wand to make her magically pregnant with a son who would walk and talk at birth and say that Half-Man was his father. She gave birth nine months later, and the boy said he could recognize his father. The king made all the men pass before the boy, who recognized Half-Man. Angry, the king sent all three of the sons away. As soon as they reached a suitable place, Half-Man conjured up a castle. He went ahead of the princess, turned himself into the bourgeois, and went back. The princess repulsed him because she did not want to deceive Half-Man. Half-Man made himself known, and the princess was pleased. After some time, Half-Man invited three kings, one his father-in- law, to the castle. His son played with three golden apples, and Half-Man used the wand to put one in his father-in-law's pocket. The boy complained. Half- Man had the castle searched, and then demanded that his guests be searched. His father-in-law was astounded, and Half-Man told him the same magic had made his daughter pregnant.

Chilubi is a settlement on an island in Lake Bangweulu and its swamps, and is headquarters of Chilubi District in the Northern Province of Zambia. Chilubi Island Chilubi Island lies just north of the centre of the eastern side of the lake. It has an unusual zig-zag shape of about five segments, each about 12 km long and 1.5 to 3 km wide. It resembles a Chinese dragon with its head (at the north-west end) just in the open lake and its body and tail (south-east end) in the swamps. The shortest distance on land from nose to tail is 25 km, and it has about 100 km of shoreline.Google Earth Shoreline measured at 1 km centres. The smaller Nsumbu Island lies 1 km south-east of Chilubi Island. Satellite image: The shores of Chilubi Island are lined with villages while the interior consists of patches of wooded grassland. The soil is largely sandy and not so fertile, and the only food that grows well in it is cassava, which is the staple of the people on the island. The main settlements on Chilubi Island are Muchinshi, Bukotelo (headquarters of the chief of Chief Chiwanangala, Yombwe, Kashitu, Kapampa, Muule, and Santa Maria, a Catholic mission.Terracarta/International Travel Maps, Vancouver Canada: \\"Zambia, 2nd edition\\", 2000. The island is served by passenger ferries from Samfya and Nsombo in Luwingu District and Chaba at the north end of the lake, and there is an airstrip at the mission, which in the past has mostly served the flying doctors' service. The main occupation of the island is fishing and subsistence farming, with some employment provided by schools, a health centre, the District Council and the mission. Chilubi town The town or large village is situated at the most north-westerly tip of the island. Chilubi is 45 km across the lake from Samfya, 28 km from Chaba and 38 km from Nsombo. Chilubi is unique in Zambia, being the only one of the 72 district headquarters or bomas on an island, with no road connections. History During the colonial era, the island was visited regularly but infrequently by the local Government representative, who would hold discussions with the local chiefs and sub- chiefs, to learn of their problems and to explain Government Policies, as well as to take a census, and collect taxes. Their reports were similar in style & content to those in the Domesday Book.http://www.spanglefish.com/gervasclay/index.asp?pageid=661495&msg;=Content%20Updated A boma was first established at the southern tip of the island,NRZAM.org website: Directorate of Colonial Surveys: Map of Bangweulu Swamps (1952).

He laid founding work in identifying amino acids, the fundamental building blocks of proteins. He did this through recognizing the first of them, asparagine, in 1806, in the industry's adoption of industrial dyes, with the identification of alizarin in 1826, and in the emergence of modern medications, through the identification of codeine in 1832, a opiate alkaloid substance of widespread use with analgesic and antidiarrheal properties. Robiquet was born in Rennes. He was at first a pharmacist in the French armies during the French Revolution years and became a professor at the √âcole de pharmacie in Paris, where he died. (For biography details refer to the French Wikipedia article) Notable scientific achievements were among other things his isolation and characterization of properties of asparagine (the first amino acid to be identified, from asparagus, achieved. In 1806, with Louis Nicolas Vauquelin), cantharidin (1810), the Sigma-1 receptor agonist noscapine (1817), caffeine (1821), alizarin (later on moved to mass industrial production by Carl Gr√§be and Carl Theodore Liebermann in Germany, and by William Henry Perkin in Great Britain) and purpurin (1826), Orcin (1829), amygdalin (1830), as well as codeine (1832). Some of these discoveries were made in collaboration with other scientists.  Academic titles and distinctions  Registered Pharmacist (1808), lecturer in chemistry at the √âcole Polytechnique (1811), Deputy Professor in History of pharmaceutical matters (1811) then Professor (1814) then Administrator-Treasurer (1824) at the Ecole de Pharmacie now the Facult√© de Pharmacie see [3], member then Secretary General (1817) and President (1826) of the Soci√©t√© de Pharmacie later on known as Acad√©mie Nationale de Pharmacie see [8], member of the Acad√©mie de M√©decine (1820), member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences (1833), one of the founders and first President of the Soci√©t√© de Pr√©voyance des Pharmaciens see [6](1820). Distinguished with the order of the L√©gion d'Honneur (1830).  Discovery of asparagine, the first amino acid ever identified  In the fall of 1805, Robiquet, then a young help working in the laboratory of Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, started analyses, with what rudimentary methods were then available, with asparagus juice. After a number of operations he obtained a crystallized white matter, which he and Vauquelin tried to characterize in 1806 as day by day their attempts found it to be some kind of new \\"chemical principle\\" with hitherto unknown properties, nothing like well known mineral salts classically obtained in the 18th century. Duly convinced this is something completely new, they call this matter \\"asparagin\\", after the asparagus plant they extracted it from. Asparagine will turn out to be one of the 22 amino acids that build-up all living matter on earth, the first ever identified and understood as belonging to a new class of molecules. Progress in isolating the other amino acids will be very slow, with less than a handful in total during the whole 19th century.  Discovery of various dyes  Even until the middle of 19th century, all dyes used for colouring cloth were natural substances, many of which were expensive and labour-intensive to extract. Furthermore, many lacked stability through washing or exposure to sunlight, or fastness. For instance, the colour purple, which had been a mark of aristocracy and prestige since ancient times in Rome, the Middle East and Egypt, was especially expensive and difficult to produce‚Äîthe dye used, known as Tyrian purple, was made from the glandular mucus of certain molluscs. Its extraction was variable and complicated, and dependent on the availability of the very specific type of shell (actually two types, now known the one as Bolinus brandaris, and the other as Hexaplex trunculus, nowadays classified within two different genders) from which it was extracted. Another type of natural red dye used from times immemorial was obtained from madder root in Central Asia and Egypt, where it was grown as early as 1500 BC. Cloth dyed with madder root pigment was found in the tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun and in the ruins of Pompeii and ancient Corinth. In the Middle Ages, Charlemagne encouraged madder cultivation. It grew well in the sandy soils of the Netherlands and became an important part of the local economy. By 1804, the English dye maker George Field had introduced new techniques known as lake madder, that extended the use of the tincture to paints. Robiquet obtained from madder root two distinct molecules with dye properties, the one producing a magnificent red, that he called alizarin, which proved as well extremely stable, and another, of less stable properties, that he called purpurin. Some 30 years later in April 1856, William Henry Perkin, then a mere youngster working as assistant at the Royal College of Chemistry in London within a team intent on research over the synthesis of quinine, a potent drug, discovered a process that obtained a purple dye (which he called mauveine) from aniline, which in turn could be easily obtained from coal tar; over the next ten years Perkin set up the first industrial model of molecules obtained through synthesis from coal tar and his success had prompted intense research from numerous teams all over Europe on coal tar by-products, while he himself pursued such a work on top of his industrial activity. Thus it came that in 1868, in turn alizarin was proved to be obtainable from anthracene, in parallel by Perkin and by Carl Gr√§be and Carl Theodore Liebermann, both working in Germany for the BASF company; unfortunately Perkin missed the patent priority by one single day, alizarin's extraordinary properties made it become the first really mass industry-produced dye and enabled the rise of BASF to first rank in the chemistry industry world.  Discovery and industrialization of codeine Codeine is probably Robiquet's most important contribution, that prevails still today with a very strong presence and impact on daily life; in effect, until the beginning of the 19th century, raw opium was used in diverse preparations known as laudanum (see Thomas de Quincey's \\"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater\\"), paregoric elixirs (a number of them, very popular in England since the beginning of the 18th century), and health or even death hazards to users from improper preparation or improper use were frequent. The isolation of codeine by Robiquet from opium's several active components while working on refined morphine extraction processes, opened the path to the elaboration of a new generation of specific antitussive and antidiarrheal potions of much safer use, based on codeine only, which became immediately extremely popular. Codeine is nowadays by far the most widely used opiate in the world and very likely even the most commonly used drug overall according to numerous reports over the years by organizations such as the World Health Organization and its League of Nations predecessor agency and others. It is one of the most effective orally-administered opioid analgesics and has a wide safety margin. It is from 8 to 12 percent of the strength of morphine in most people; differences in metabolism can change this figure as can other medications, depending on its route of administration. While codeine can still be directly extracted from opium, its original source, most codeine is nowadays synthesized from morphine through the process of O-methylation.  Sundry researches in pharmacology; missing by a hair's breadth the identification of the benzoyl radical in 1830  Robiquet has analysed the chemical byproducts that could be obtained from a variety of plants: asparagus, madder root, as already mentioned, with the important associated discoveries, and also others, which mostly helped in consolidating the existence of some molecules in a wide range of plants. Thus, in 1809, Robiquet extracts from liquorice root a sweetish matter which he dubs glycyrrhizine, from Glycirrhiza, the denomination of the genus to which belongs liquorice. He also obtained an oily fraction (0.8%), small quantities of a matter with properties of a gum, albuminic substances, tannins, starch, a yellowish dye, a fraction with bitter taste, and, as from asparagi, a fraction that can be crystallized and seemingly close to asparagin, which it will be indeed proven to be in 1828 by Plisson.http://www.ibiblio.org/herbmed/eclectic/kings/glycyrrhiza.html Robiquet likewise analysed a variety of animal tissues. Thus in 1810, he isolated from Lytta vesicatoria, an insect, a molecule that he calls cantharidin, which he proves is the cause of the severe irritations and blisters provoked by that insect, and is present in a variety of unrelated species that use the molecule as a protection of their eggs from predation [1] (Two families of insects belonging to the order of Coleoptera synthetise that molecule : Meloidae and Oedemeridae. The first family, to the which Lytta vesicatoria belongs in the Lytta genus, is rich of several thousands of species) In fact, even back into the days of the early classical period civilizations of the western Mediterrean, some types of flies from Spain had a reputation for inducing aphrodisiac effects when used in preparations after having been desiccated. Cantharidin has never been proven to provide such collateral benefits, whereas Robiquet demonstrated it had very definite toxic and poisonous properties comparable in degree to that of the most violent poisons known in the 19th century, such as strychnine.Exp√©riences sur les cantharides, Robiquet, Annales de Chimie, 1810, vol. 76, pp. 302‚Äì322. This particular study, that demonstrated, as early as in 1810, the possibility to separate, using \\"energetic\\" methods, a simple \\"principle\\" that was the actual effective fraction of a traditional natural compound obtained by \\"soft\\" methods has been exemplary for the burgeoning community of chemists in the early 19th century, and will prompt very rapidly a flurry of similar attempts that will yield within a few decades an incredible number of molecules from an ever growing number of research groups throughout Europe, and soon in the trail, in the US. In the frame of that same investigation, Robiquet in addition evidences the presence of uric acid within insects feeding on plant tissues. Over a period of some fifteen years, Pierre Robiquet will also conduct a series of investigations on bitter almonds oil, a complex substance obtained from Prunus dulcis. In 1816, together with Jean-Jacques Colin,Recherches sur la nature de la mati√®re huileuse des chimistes hollandais, Robiquet, Colin, Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 1816, vol. 1, pp. 337‚Äì45 they obtain a new component which they call \\"√©ther hydrochlorique\\", (1,2-Dichloroethane), which they will try to promote as a reinvigorating medicine. In 1830, together with Antoine Boutron-Charlard, Robiquet obtains a new molecule which he calls amygdalin; this component presented strange properties and was actually the first glycoside ever to be evidenced. This discovery was opening the door to the huge family of aromatic molecules, that are based on the cyclic 6 carbon benzenoic structure. In their various attempts at breaking down amygdalin in by-products, Robiquet and Boutron- Charlard obtained benzaldehyde but they failed in working out a proper interpretation of the structure of amygdalin that would account for it, and thus missed the identification of the benzoyl radical C7H5O. This last step was achieved some few months later (1832) by Friedrich W√∂hler and Justus Liebig, these two got somehow a bit unfairly all the credit for this breakthrough result that was opening an entirely new branch for the industry of chemicals with wide-ranging applications. Amygdalin and related molecules have been used throughout the 19th (promoted by Ernst T. Krebs) and 20th centuries as anti-cancer drugs, however with inconclusive results as to actual benefits, while it was demonstrated in 1972 in a study at the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute that amygdalin (often sold under the brand name of \\"Laetrile\\") could be toxic as it breaks down in the body to form cyanide.

History = Ancient Mataram Hindu Period (8th‚Äì9th century AD)  The history of Purworejo is first recorded on Kayu Ara Hiwang inscription on 5 October 901, which is being found in Boro Wetan Village. The area was originally known by the name 'Bagelen' (read /ba¬∑g…ô¬∑l…õn/) and it is now become a smaller part of the whole Purworejo regency. In the 9th centuries, Bagelen is part of the history of the ancient Mataram Hindu civilization (See: Medang Kingdom) which was flourished on Kedu Plain. It is estimated that within the period of Rakai Watukara Dyah Balitung, Bagelen had become the capital of the Mataram Hindu Kingdom or that it is the origin of the king as Watukara is a river name in Bagelen. The ancient artifact being found in Bagelen is Kayu Ara Hiwang inscription which explain Shima ceremony. At that period, when a new land is being opened for economic or religious use, there will be a ceremony being held by the authorities, namely Shima ceremony. The authorities mentioned in the inscription are: Sang Ratu Bajra, who is allegedly as Rakryan Mahamantri/Mapatih Hino Sri Daksottama Bahubajrapratipaksaya, who is also the brother-in-law of Rakai Watukura Dyah Balitung and who is also later became Balitung's successor. The ceremony mentions that the land is being freed from any tax duty, but it has the obligation to maintain the holiness of a sacred place called \\"parahiyangan\\" (which means the place of Gods). The ceremony also purified the area of Kayu Ara Hiwang of any evil's influence. Kayu Ara Hiwang area itself consists of rice fields, savanna, caves and arable land. The cave mentioned in the inscription is identified as Seplawan Cave, where a shiva gold statue is being found and therefore the second artifact within Bagelen area. Within this period, Bagelen became a religious center where some Buddhist monks (and often skilled with martial arts) were probably lived along the Bogowonto river banks.  Mataram Sultanate (Muslim) Period (15th‚Äì16th century AD)  During this period, the people of Bagelen is famous for becoming the special arms force for Sutawijaya, hence the beginning of its militaristic character which also said as inheritance of the martial art skills being instilled by the previous Buddhist monks from the ancient Mataram period.  Dutch Colonial Period (16th‚Äì19th century AD)  During this period, Bagelen area was notorious of its powerful insurgent which support Prince Diponegoro throughout Java War. Upon the defeat of Diponegoro, Bagelen was being asked from Mataram Sultanate in order to undermine the power of Bagelen's insurgent and was being integrated into Kedu Residency by the Dutch Colonial ruler. The new town, called Poerworedjo (new spelling: Purworejo) is being designed by a Dutch architect by adopting traditional Javanese architecture and tradition. The Dutch implemented indirect rule, which is reflected in its town architecture, where the regent is from the local leader (Raden Adipati Cokronegoro Pertama) and the co-ruler (the regent assistant) is always a Dutch. This new town was also served as Dutch military base camp which housed the Dutch Black Colonial Armed Forces from West Africa. Some Dutch residents were born, lived and died in Purworejo, the records can be found in The Civil Registry of the Dutch East-Indies.The Civil Registry of The Dutch East-Indies Some Dutch colonial buildings are still in a good shape until now as of Regency Official House (1840), a church which still become GPIB Church (1879), Kweekschool (1915), Train Station, Bank, Hospital. During this period, there were 2 main religious figures: a Muslim preacher (mubaligh) kyai Imam Pura and a Javanese Christian Evangelist, Kyai Sadrach. This is the evidence that in Purworejo, Muslim and Christians are being accepted harmoniously by its people.  Modern Indonesian period  In the modern day Indonesia, Purworejo produce skilled work force in the area of government, education and military. The prominent general from Purworejo is Sarwo Edhie Wibowo who is also the father-in-law of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. There are also several other notable general arms forces, government officials, ministers and lecturers as being listed in the notables from Purworejo. Purworejo is recently more well known as the town of retirement. As the economic and government activities of modern Indonesia is centered in Jakarta, Purworejo citizen are majority urged to work in Jakarta or in other parts of Indonesia or even worldwide. However, there is also an urge for Purworejo citizen to repatriate and to build retirement residences in Purworejo. Because of its reputation as retirement town in the modern day, its inheritance as a Dutch town and its ancient inheritance of Buddhist religious center, Purworejo is relatively a peaceful town with vast main roads, big old trees on both sides, regular squares of town blocks and its preserved Dutch buildings. The wider area of Purworejo mainly has agriculture and livestock activities while some medium-sized, export oriented industrial activities (traditional furniture, textile and sports equipment) is being established in the southern part of the region.  Administrative districts  Purworejo Regency is divided into the following sixteen subdistricts (kecamatan). * Bagelen * Banyuurip * Bayan * Bener * Bruno * Butuh * Gebang * Grabag * Kaligesing * Kemiri * Kutoarjo * Loano * Ngombol * Pituruh * Purwodadi * Purworejo  Transportation = Airport  The airport closest to the town is Adisucipto International Airport which is approximately within 1.5 hours driving distance.

It is the fifth novel in the Lincoln Rhyme series, which began with The Bone Collector. Plot introduction The story centers around a serial killer loose in New York City whose slayings are patterned after illusionist tricks. When the killer illusionist uses his tricks to baffle and evade police, forensic expert Lincoln Rhyme and his longtime partner Amelia Sachs are brought in to investigate, setting off a tense cat-and-mouse chase where nothing is as it seems. Explanation of the novel's title The novel's title is a specific reference to an illusionist trick where a person is made to disappear and then reappear. It also alludes to the killer in the novel, who is quite talented at disappearing soon after his crimes are committed. Plot The plot starts off with an introduction by Malerick, the antagonist in the story. Speaking in patter to his imaginary 'Revered Audience', he introduces the first trick he shall perform, The Lazy Hangman. The first victim is first cuffed at the hands and a cord is slipped over her neck. The other end of the cord is tied to her feet, and as the victim's legs tend to straighten over time, the cord around her neck is tightened and the victim strangles herself. However, Malerick is caught after committing the act by two patrol officers and flees the scene. The officers corner him in a locked room where he claims to have a hostage. They hear a gunshot, but when they charge in they find that the room is empty. Lincoln Rhyme is pulled into the case by Lon Sellitto, and through their combined effort, discovers that the killer had escaped from the scene much earlier, using a quick-change technique used by magicians (among other performers). The remaining evidence at the scene also points to a professional magician, hence Rhyme decides to rope in yet another civilian consultant: Kara, an aspiring magician. Kara helps the team with some insights on the tricks performed by Malerick, and decides to stay on with the investigation. At the same time, Malerick has tracked down his next victim for his next trick, Sawing a Woman in Half. He escapes the cops closing in using another quick-change. The victim was found with a watch smashed at exactly 12 noon. (Earlier, a watch was found beside the first victim, the time displayed is 8 a.m.) This leads the police to believe that the next victim would be at four in the afternoon, but Kara tells them about misdirection: leading the audience to believe one thing when the performer intends to do another. Rhyme investigates the trace evidence found at the scene and believes the next victim will be at Central Park. Meanwhile, another case is introduced parallel to the running plot. Charles Grady, an assistant district attorney who specialises in convicting criminals. Grady is involved in prosecuting Andrew Constable, who leads an extremist movement called the Patriot Assembly. Grady had received death threats for his involvement in this case, and Roland Bell has been brought in to secure his safety until the trial is over. At about 2 p.m, the police and ESU surround Central Park, closing in on Malerick as he performs the Water Torture Cell on his next victim. He fakes a gunshot and escapes into a fair. Sachs gives chase with Kara, and as Sachs searches for Malerick, Kara is believed to be stabbed, causing a commotion in the crowd. Malerick escapes the fair and is chased by another police officer. Kara is revealed to be alive, faking her own stabbing to flush the killer out. Malerick gets to his stolen getaway vehicle and Sachs gives chase, getting the left front fender of her Camaro smashed in the process. However, the car Malerick was driving was run into the Harlem River. The police believe Malerick to be dead. At eight p.m that night, Charles Grady is scheduled to attend his daughter's piano recital, but Rhyme had discovered that there will be a hitman coming for him then. An arrest is made when a reverend with connections to the Patriot Assembly approaches Grady's car with a pistol. After a relatively successful day, Thom demands that Rhyme rests. During this period, Malerick slips into Rhyme's room using an officer's uniform he obtained earlier and sets fire to Rhyme's room. Rhyme survives via the timely arrival of the fire department. Malerick mentions the name of his final trick, the Burning Mirror, to Rhyme. Kara traces the trick to Erick Weir, a magician whose wife died in a circus fire some years ago. Weir himself survived with severe burns, which fit the profile given by earlier witnesses. The team learns that the circus Cirque Fantistique is performing in New York over the weekend. The owner, Kadesky, owned the circus which got Weir's wife killed. The team believes that Malerick may be targeting Cirque Fantistique's show over the weekend, but dismisses it as misdirection as Weir is arrested breaking into Grady's apartment. Weir is locked up in a detention centre, but escapes yet again, faking his own killing by firing an officer's gun. Yet another hitman from the Patriot Assembly is sent for Grady's life, but his attempt backfired. Constable awaits for Malerick's arrival, believing that the Patriot Assembly had hired him to rescue him. However, the misdirection is finally revealed as Rhyme exposes Malerick's plan to set fire to the Cirque Fantistique performing that night. Malerick is arrested in his apartment, where he is revealed to be Erick Weir's former apprentice, Arthur Loesser. The fire that destroyed Erick Weir's life also changed that of his apprentice; Weir died shortly after the fire and Loesser has been planning revenge ever since. He has been leading the police to believe that Weir committed the crimes. Towards the end of the novel, Rhyme pulls off a short performance in front of Kadesky with Kara, requesting that she be allowed to join Cirque Fantistique by pretending that she was Loesser's accomplice so that she could demonstrate her own skills. Sachs, having excelled at trying for the rank of sergeant earlier in the novel, is suspended from duty by Congressman Victor Ramos, who was forced away from the Harlem River crash by Sachs when he was allegedly trying to rescue anyone in the car despite Sachs arguing that nobody was inside (it is all-but-explicitly acknowledged that Ramos would be up for re-election soon and may have attempted the 'rescue' for publicity). She is reinstated shortly after, and is promoted to Detective Third Class. The end of the novel introduces Sachs' decision to get her car painted red, which is featured in the subsequent novels.

Born in London, England, his family emigrated to Toronto when he was 6 years old. After completing his education at the Toronto Grammar School, he went to work for his father who was a stationer and bookseller. He was active in the publishing industry both in England and in Canada, joining the firm John Nimmo & Son which later became Nimmo & Bain. He returned to Canada in 1882. After managing the fledgling Canada Publishing Company, Bain was selected in 1883 to become the first chief librarian of the Toronto Public Library. He held this position until his death in 1908. Colour portrait of James Bain by Edmund Wyly Grier, commissioned by the Board of the Toronto Public Library in 1909. As chief librarian, he was occupied with building both the library's collection and new branches. Acquiring the library's first collection took some diplomacy on his part, since in the 1880s fiction was controversial. In the campaign to establish a free library, some of the opposition had argued against it on the grounds that taxes shouldn't be used to circulate novels. While the library did acquire novels, the bulk of the collection was more serious. He was particularly concerned with ensuring that the library's collection include \\"every work of any consequence\\" in the fields of Canadian history and literature. The first building space and book collection for the library came from the Toronto Mechanics' Institute, who had opened a subscription library in 1833. The collection was supplemented by $15,000 worth of books that Bain acquired on a trip to England in late 1883. Bain welcomed patrons to the first Toronto Public Library in the Mechanics' Institute in 1884. Two branches, Northern and Western, also opened that year, with Eastern following in 1888, Dundas in 1889 and College in 1900.'James Bain, Jr., Toronto chief librarian, 1883-1908', Libraries Today: http://www.uoguelph.ca/~lbruce/photos/Bainjr.htm In 1903, Bain secured Carnegie funding to build a new central library (now the Koffler Student Centre at the University of Toronto) and three branches, Yorkville, Queen and Lisgar, and Riverdale. After his death, the library received a second Carnegie grant to build more branches. Seven of the ten Carnegie libraries are still open as branches of the Toronto Public Library. He helped found the Ontario Library Association, serving as president of the preliminary committee for 1900 and as its president for 1901 and 1902. He was also a founding member of the Champlain Society and held the role of Treasurer and was the president of the Royal Canadian Institute from 1900 to 1902.

Keggin, the discoverer of the Keggin Structure. Keggin structure Keggin structure is the best known structural form for heteropoly acids. It is the structural form of Œ±-Keggin anions, which have a general formula of [XM12O40]n‚àí, where X is the heteroatom (most commonly are P5+, Si4+, or B3+), M is the addenda atom (most common are molybdenum and tungsten), and O represents oxygen. The structure self-assembles in acidic aqueous solution and is the most stable structure of polyoxometalate catalysts.  History  The first Œ±-Keggin anion, ammonium phosphomolybdate ((NH4)3[PMo12O40]), was first reported by Berzelius in 1826. In 1892, Blomstrand proposed the structure of phosphomolybdic acid and other poly-acids as a chain or ring configuration. Alfred Werner, using the coordination compounds ideas of Copaux, attempted to explain the structure of silicotungstic acid. He assumed a central group, [SiO4]4‚àí ion, enclosed by four [RW2O6]+, where R is a unipositive ion. The [RW2O6]+ are linked to the central group by primary valences. Two more R2W2O7 groups were linked to the central group by secondary valences. This proposal accounted for the characteristics of most poly-acids, but not all. In 1928, Linus Pauling proposed a structure for Œ±-Keggin anions consisting of a tetrahedral central ion, [XO4]n‚àí8, caged by twelve WO6 octahedra. In this proposed structure, three of the oxygen on each of the octahedra shared electrons with three neighboring octahedra. As a result, 18 oxygen atoms were used as bridging atoms between the metal atoms. The remaining oxygen atoms bonded to a proton. This structure explained many characteristics that were observed such as basicities of alkali metal salts and the hydrated form of some of the salts. However the structure could not explain the structure of dehydrated acids. James Fargher Keggin with the use of X-ray diffraction experimentally determined the structure of Œ±-Keggin anions in 1934. The Keggin structure accounts for both the hydrated and dehydrated Œ±-Keggin anions without the need for significant structural change. The Keggin structure is the widely accepted structure for the Œ±-Keggin anions.J.C. Bailar, Jr. The Chemistry of the Coordination Compounds, Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1956, pp 472-482  Structure and physical properties  Keggin structure of phosphotungstate anion = Cage of the Keggin structure + Central tetrahedron The structure has full tetrahedral symmetry and is composed of one heteroatom surrounded by four oxygen atoms to form a tetrahedron. The heteroatom is located centrally and caged by 12 octahedral MO6-units linked to one another by the neighboring oxygen atoms. There are a total of 24 bridging oxygen atoms that link the 12 addenda atoms. The metal centres in the 12 octahedra are arranged on a sphere almost equidistant from each other, in four M3O13 units, giving the complete structure an overall tetrahedral symmetry. The bond length between atoms varies depending on the heteroatom (X) and the addenda atoms (M). For the 12‚Äìphosphotungstic acid, Keggin determined the bond length between the heteroatom and each the four central oxygen atoms to be 1.5 √Ö. The bond length form the central oxygen to the addenda atoms is 2.43 √Ö. The bond length between the addenda atoms and each of the bridging oxygen is 1.9 √Ö. The remaining 12 oxygen atoms that are each double bonded to an addenda atom have a bond length of 1.70 √Ö. The octahedra are therefore distorted.J.F. Keggin. Proc. Roy. Soc., A, 144, 75-100 (1934)G.M. Brown; M.R. Noe-Spirlet; W.R. Bursing; H.A. Levy. Acta. Cryst. B33, 1038-1046 (1977) This structure allows the molecule to hydrate and dehydrate without significant structural changes and the molecule is thermally stable in the solid state for use in vapor phase reactions at high temperatures (400‚àí500 ¬∞C).Y. Izumi; K. Urabe; M. Onaka. Zeolite, Clay, and Heteropoly Acid in Organic Reactions, Kodansha Ltd., Tokoyo 1992, pp 100-105 Isomerism Including the original Keggin structure there are 5 isomers, designated by the prefixes Œ±-, Œ≤-, Œ≥-, Œ¥- and Œµ-. The original Keggin structure is designated Œ±-. These isomers are sometimes termed Baker, Baker-Figgis or rotational isomers,A New Fundamental Type of Inorganic Complex: Hybrid between Heteropoly and Conventional Coordination Complexes. Possibilities for Geometrical Isomerisms in 11-, 12-, 17-, and 18-Heteropoly Derivatives. LCW Baker, JS Figgis Journal of the American Chemical Society 92(12), 3794-3797 (1970) These involve different rotational orientations of the Mo3O13 units, which lowers the symmetry of the overall structure. Lacunary Keggin structures The term lacunary is applied to ions which have a fragment missing, sometimes called defect structures. Examples are the (XM11O39)n‚àí and (XM9O34)n‚àí formed by the removal from the Keggin structure of sufficient Mo and O atoms to eliminate 1 or 3 adjacent MO6 octahedra. The Dawson structure, X2M18O62n‚àí, is made up of two Keggin lacunary fragments with 3 missing octahedra. Dawson structure Group 13 cations with the Keggin structure The cluster cation (Al13O4(OH)24(H2O)12)7+ has the Keggin structure with a tetrahedral Al atom in the centre of the cluster coordinated to 4 oxygen atoms. The formula can be expressed as (AlO4Al12(OH)24(H2O)12)7+. This ion is generally called the Al13 ion.

Chem., 42 (13), 4153 -4159, (2003) The iron Keggin ion Due to the similar aqueous chemistries of aluminum and iron, it has been long thought that an analogous iron polycation should be isolatable from water. Moreover, in 2007, the structure of ferrihydrite was determined and shown to be built of iron Keggin ions.F. M. Michel, L. Ehm, S. M. Antao, et al. Science, 316, 1726-1729 (2007) This further captured scientists‚Äô imagination and drive to isolate the iron Keggin ion. In 2015, the iron Keggin ion was isolated from water, but as a polyanion with a ‚àí17 charge; and protecting chemistry was required.O. Sadeghi, L. N. Zakharov and M. Nyman, Aqueous formation and manipulation of the iron-oxo Keggin ion Science; 2015; 347 (6228) pp 1359 - 1362; Iron-bound water is very acidic; so it is difficult to capture the intermediate Keggin ion form without bulky and nonprotic ligands instead of the water that is found in the aluminum Keggin ion. However, more important in this synthesis was the bismuth (Bi3+) counterions that provided high positive charge to stabilize the high negative charge of the heptadecavalent polyanion.  Chemical properties  The stability of the Keggin structure allows the metals in the anion to be readily reduced. Depending on the solvent, acidity of the solution and the charge on the Œ±-Keggin anion, it can be reversibly reduced in one- or multiple-electron steps.T. Okuhara; N. Mizuno; M. Misono.

However, in recent years the increased variation in semiconductor devices and interconnect has introduced a number of issues that cannot be handled by traditional (deterministic) STA. This has led to considerable research into statistical static timing analysis, which replaces the normal deterministic timing of gates and interconnects with probability distributions, and gives a distribution of possible circuit outcomes rather than a single outcome.  Comparison with conventional STA  Deterministic STA is popular for good reasons: *It requires no vectors, so it does not miss paths. *The run time is linear in circuit size (for the basic algorithm). *The result is conservative. *It typically uses some fairly simple libraries (typically delay and output slope as a function of input slope and output load). *It is easy to extend to incremental operation for use in optimization. STA, while very successful, has a number of limitations: *Cannot easily handle within-die correlation, especially if spatial correlation is included. *Needs many corners to handle all possible cases. *If there are significant random variations, then in order to be conservative at all times, it is too pessimistic to result in competitive products. *Changes to address various correlation problems, such as CPPR (Common Path Pessimism Removal) make the basic algorithm slower than linear time, or non-incremental, or both. SSTA attacks these limitations more or less directly. First, SSTA uses sensitivities to find correlations among delays. Then it uses these correlations when computing how to add statistical distributions of delays. There is no technical reason why determistic STA could not be enhanced to handle correlation and sensitivities, by keeping a vector of sensitivities with each value as SSTA does. Historically, this seemed like a big burden to add to STA, whereas it was clear it was needed for SSTA, so no-one complained. See some of the criticism of SSTA below where this alternative is proposed.  Methods  There are two main categories of SSTA algorithms ‚Äì path-based and block-based methods. A path-based algorithmOrshansky, M.; Keutzer, K., 2002, , Design Automation Conference, 2002. Proceedings. 39th, Vol., Iss., 2002, Pages: 556-561. sums gate and wire delays on specific paths. The statistical calculation is simple, but the paths of interest must be identified prior to running the analysis. There is the potential that some other paths may be relevant but not analyzed so path selection is important. A block-based algorithmVisweswariah, C.; Ravindran, K.; Kalafala, K.; Walker, S.G.; Narayan, S.; Beece, D.K.; Piaget, J.; Venkateswaran, N.; Hemmett, J.G., 2006, , IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, , Vol.25, Iss.10, Oct. 2006, Pages: 2170-2180 generates the arrival times (and required) times for each node, working forward (and backward) from the clocked elements. The advantage is completeness, and no need for path selection. The biggest problem is that a statistical max (or min) operation that also considered correlation is needed, which is a hard technical problem. There are SSTA cell characterization tools that are now available such as Altos Design Automation's Variety tool.  Criticism  A number of criticisms have been leveled at SSTA: *It's too complex, especially with realistic (non-gaussian) distributions. *It's hard to couple to an optimization flow or algorithm. *It's hard to get the data the algorithm needs. Even if you can get this data, it is likely to be time- varying and hence unreliable. *If used seriously by the customers of a fab, it restricts the changes the fab might make, if they change that statistical properties of the process. *The benefit is relatively small, compared to an enhanced deterministic STA that also takes into account sensitivities and correlation.

The camp is the oldest residential camp in Canada, founded by what is now called the YMCA of Greater Halifax/Dartmouth in 1889. It is located on a 100-acre peninsula on Merigomish Harbour in Pictou County. Seasons=Summer Big Cove's summer season runs for eight weeks; with two-month-long leadership sessions, three two-week sessions (offered to Juniors and Seniors), eight one-week sessions (offered to Juniors and Seniors), and four three-day sessions (offered to Little Big Cove). These sessions start the first weekend of July and run through to the end of August. Big Cove employs 45-50 staff and has an approximate capacity of 104 campers and 32 Leadership participants. Spring and fall During the spring and fall sessions, Big Cove is open to school or community groups to rent and use the facilities. During these times there is program staff on hand to provide programming and support to the group on site. Big Cove also provides all amenities needed including a cook. Although swimming is not available, many other program areas are fully functional; including high-ropes, archery, hiking, among others. The average group stays for three days and during the stay, they will participate in six program areas, as well as have a campfire, participate in a 'skit night', and have two camp-wide games. Programs thumb Big Cove Y.M.C.A. Camp is split into four sections based on age: Little Big Cove  Little Big Cove is a three-day (two night) program designed with the intention of getting younger children more accustomed to the idea of a camp lifestyle. It is offered for children ages 6‚Äì10 and is popular with first-time campers. Participants do several of the hallmark camp activities Big Cove offers; these include canoeing, swimming, tree-climbing, and many more. Campers wrap up the week by participating in a picnic, where campers walk to a nearby campsite, eat a lunch, and participate in outdoor games. They participate in their own closing campfire; with songs, stories, and snacks. Juniors  Big Cove's junior section is a one or two-week program for campers who range from 6-11 in age. Campers participate in: canoeing, archery, Adventures, Arts & Crafts, Swimming and much more. All junior campers participate in a one-night hiking out-trip, where campers set up tents at one of Big Cove's campsites and sleep there overnight; eating a snack, and a breakfast in the woods. At the end of the session, campers go to the closing campfire, where the Keeper of the Cove, a longstanding tradition at Big Cove, gives them a gift from the cove. Seniors The senior section at Big Cove is a program, one or two weeks in length, designed as the next step up from juniors, for ages 12‚Äì15. Seniors participate in all camp activities offered and have the added bonus of being able to participate in senior-exclusive programs such as high ropes and hammock village. One week seniors participate in a more advanced one-night ocean canoe trips, while two- week seniors participate in three-night ocean canoe trips. One week campers canoe to one of Big Cove's campsites ranging from a 1-hour paddle to a 4-hour paddle, set up camp, stay overnight, and canoe back in the morning. Two-week campers, on their three-day out-trips, go around Merigomish Harbour, staying at different campsites each night. At the end of their session, campers go to the closing campfire, where the Keeper of the Cove, an old tradition at Big Cove, gives them a gift from the cove. Leadership Big Cove's leadership section is a month-long skills building program, offered for campers aged 15‚Äì17. Big Cove's Leadership Section is split into: =Leadership One: L1= L1 is an adventure-based program, which focuses on building the hard-skills associated with leadership in a wilderness setting. In their 27 days at Big Cove, L1 campers participate in a ten-day canoe trip from Ballantynes Cove along Nova Scotia's southern coast, up to Cape Breton Island. During the rest of their stay, campers participate in many of the camp activities Big Cove offers to younger campers but also have the opportunity to build their skills through many skill-building programs L1 offers; such as teaching blocks, shadowing, and more. At the end of the month, participants have the opportunity to memorialize their session by creating a plaque, which will be hung at Big Cove's Arts and Crafts Hall. =Leadership Two: L2= L2, the post-requisite for L1, is a soft-skill oriented training program. It involves many teaching sessions led by members of the resource team and the L2 Directors. L2 is considered a major component in preparing campers for the transition to counselling. L2 participants have the opportunity to shadow a cabin for one week, in order to build up their comfort in a leadership role. L2s also go on a ten-day paddle around the south-east coast of Prince Edward Island, from the ferry to (Panmure Island) References Category:Summer camps in Canada Category:1889 establishments in Nova Scotia ","title":"Big Cove YMCA Camp"},{"id":"10864133","text":"Lealman, known as East Lealman until 2010, is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pinellas County, Florida, United States.

Until the 1970s, clandestine operations were primarily political in nature, generally aimed at assisting groups or nations favored by the sponsor. Examples include U.S. intelligence involvement with German and Japanese war criminals after World War II. Today these operations are numerous and include technology-related clandestine operations. The bulk of clandestine operations are related to the gathering of intelligence, typically by both people (clandestine human intelligence) and by hidden sensors. Placement of underwater or land-based communications cable taps, cameras, microphones, traffic sensors, monitors such as sniffers, and similar systems require that the mission go undetected and unsuspected. Clandestine sensors may also be on unmanned underwater vehicles, reconnaissance (spy) satellites (such as Misty), low-observability unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), or unmanned detectors (as in Operation Igloo White and its successors), or hand-placed by clandestine human operations. The United States Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (Joint Publication JP1-02, dated 5 January 2007) defines \\"clandestine operation\\" as \\"An operation sponsored or conducted by governmental departments or agencies in such a way as to assure secrecy or concealment. A clandestine operation differs from a covert operation in that emphasis is placed on concealment of the operation rather than on concealment of the identity of the sponsor. In special operations, an activity may be both covert and clandestine and may focus equally on operational considerations and intelligence-related activities.\\" (JP 3-05.1). The terms clandestine and covert are not synonymous. As noted in the definition (which has been used by the United States and NATO since World War II) in a covert operation the identity of the sponsor is concealed, while in a clandestine operation the operation itself is concealed. Put differently, clandestine means \\"hidden\\", where the aim is for the operation to not be noticed at all. Covert means \\"deniable\\", such that if the operation is noticed, it is not attributed to a group. The term stealth refers both to a broad set of tactics aimed at providing and preserving the element of surprise and reducing enemy resistance. It can also be used to describe a set of technologies (stealth technology) to aid in those tactics. While secrecy and stealthiness are often desired in clandestine and covert operations, the terms secret and stealthy are not used to formally describe types of missions. Some operations may have both clandestine and covert aspects, such as the use of concealed remote sensors or human observers to direct artillery attacks and airstrikes. The attack is obviously overt (coming under attack alerts the target that he has been located by the enemy), but the targeting component (the exact method that was used to locate targets) can remain clandestine. In World War II, targets found through cryptanalysis of radio communication were attacked only if there had been aerial reconnaissance in the area, or, in the case of the shootdown of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, where the sighting could be attributed to the Coastwatchers. During the Vietnam War, trucks attacked on the Ho Chi Minh trail were completely unaware of some sensors, such as the airborne Black Crow device that sensed their ignition. They could also have been spotted by a clandestine human patrol. Harassing and interdiction (H&I;) or free-fire zone rules can also cause a target to be hit for purely random reasons.

Design and development  In 1921, Colonel Virginius Clark, chief designer of the Dayton-Wright Company, designed the Chummy sporting biplane. The airframe was advanced in its use of the new Clark Y airfoil thick-section aerofoil and a welded fuselage framework of chrome-molybdenum steel tubing. A departure from the all-wood structures found in other trainers, the structure proved sturdy and dependable. It was offered to the USAAS as a replacement for the Curtiss JN-4D trainer, with a choice of Le Rhone or Clerget rotary piston engines. In 1922, the Army ordered three TA-3 (Trainer, Air-cooled, Type 3) machines for evaluation with the Le Rhone engine and dual controls. Evaluation showed that the type had the makings of a good trainer, but was somewhat lacking in power, so in 1923 Dayton-Wright modified one TA-3 with a more powerful 110 hp (82 kW) Le Rhone. The USAAS then ordered ten examples of this improved model, and these were the last U.S. Army aircraft to be delivered with a rotary-engine. Appreciating that this type of power plant had passed its development peak, the USAAS then contracted for three examples of the TW-3 (Trainer, Water- cooled, Type 3) with a 150 hp (112 kW) Wright-Hispano I V8. The revised type clearly had greater long-term potential, and in June 1923 the USAAS contracted for 20 TW-3 production aircraft, together with enough spare parts for the construction of another three aircraft. At this time the General Motors Corporation was thinking of pulling out of the aircraft business and closing its Dayton-Wright subsidiary, so Reuben H. Fleet of the Gallaudet Aircraft Corporation secured rights to the Dayton-Wright trainer design. When Gallaudet shareholders expressed disapproval at this move, Fleet left the company and established the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation. It was to this new company the TW-3 order went, and all the aircraft were delivered by the end of 1923 with the uprated powerplant of one Wright-Hispano E (licence-built Hispano- Suiza 8) engine. Once the aircraft had entered service, Fleet continued to improve the TW-3, the most important change being the removal of the engine cowling to improve the occupants' forward and downward fields of vision. Visibility was still poor, so Fleet secured US Army permission to rebuild one TW-3 with a new, slimmer fuselage, providing tandem rather than side-by-side seating. This revised aircraft was generally known as the \\"Camel\\" due to the hump between its two cockpits. The \\"Camel\\" may be regarded as the prototype of the Consolidated response to the USAAS's 1924 requirement for a new primary trainer. In the early summer of 1924, the USAAS tested a prototype unofficially designated TW-8 and placed an order for 50 examples of the Consolidated Model 1 production variant for service with the designation PT-1. Early production models had flat dorsal turtledecks, soon replaced by a faired version, and some of the first ones were likely built at the Gallaudet plant in Norwich before production began at Buffalo. The first 171 of the 221 produced used a streamlined nose radiator, the remainder used the unfaired installation. One PT-1 airframe was completed as XPT-2 with a 220 hp (164 kW) Wright J-5 radial engine.  Operational history  The PT-1 became the first training airplane purchased by the USAAS in substantial quantity following World War I. Aviation cadets in Texas and California flew it extensively during the late 1920s and early 1930s. It acquired the nickname 'Trusty' for their excellent ability to make a quick and effective recovery from a spin. Easy to fly, the Trusty made some students overconfident, and they received a shock when they advanced to faster airplanes with more difficult handling characteristics. The 'Trusty' was commonly flown without its cowlings in an effort to prevent overheating Whereas the TW-3 had supplemented the JN-4D, the PT-1 supplanted this wholly obsolescent type and was responsible for a radical improvement in the safety record of US Army pilot training. One of the aircraft was diverted to the US Navy for trials, and four other generally similar aircraft were delivered to Siam in 1928. From 1928 the PT-1 was replaced in frontline service by the Consolidated PT-3, but then became a valuable implement in the National Guard flying programme until retired in the early 1930s.

History=1982‚Äì1997: Commercial success The band was founded in 1982 by vocalist Tatsuya Ishii (sometimes credited as \\"Carl Smoky Ishiii\\") and fellow members. They released their debut single and album in October 1985. In 1990, \\"Roman Hik≈ç\\" became a hit song. In 1992, \\"Kimi ga Iru Dake de\\" topped the Oricon chart, remaining in the charts for 33 weeks. It is the fifth best-selling song in Japan since Oricon's establishment, and the second best-selling J-Pop single, slightly behind Southern All Stars' \\"TSUNAMI\\", (released in January 2000). \\"Kimi ga Iru Dake de\\" was written around the marriage of band members Minako (also Ishii's sister) and Kaneko, the saxophone/keyboardist. However, drummer Ryo-J and guitarist Joplin Tokunoh parted ways with the band in 1995. Ishii tried to continue the band, but in the end he officially dissolved it in March 1997. 2006‚Äìpresent: Reunion With the two members returning, the band reformed in the middle of 2006 for a series of concerts as well as a few new recordings, including \\"Well Come 2\\", which spurred a video where the band members were depicted as toys (complete with enlarged doll-like heads, UPC bar codes and one, \\"James\\" Onoda Yasuhide bursting out of his \\"box\\"). The video also gives a nod to all of its members by having a screen shot with their name and them playing in the scene, this includes members of Big Horns Bee and Sue Cream Sue. It is a part of Sony Music Japan. Sony has frequently had appearances of the \\"Well Come 2\\" video on various streaming websites pulled while leaving other videos from the same DVD online. A combined CD/DVD release featured a parody of the \\"hentai\\" (aka \\"racy') videos where the two dancers (Minako and Mari, also known as \\"Sue Cream Sue\\") dance to songs of Kome Kome in various states of dress and undress (and strange costumes like animals). However, this being 20 years later, their costumes are not as skimpy as the ones in their famed \\"Costume Dance\\" videos during Kome Kome's heyday. They do poke a bit of fun with it and guitarist Be (a former cross-dresser during their early years), narrates over the slow- motion action of their backsides and when their skirts fly up a little. Although there was a very long layoff, \\"Well Come 2\\" still became a Top 10 hit on the Oricon charts. On October 22, 2006, they announced that they completely revoked their breakup.

Some authors will use the term \\"Basilian\\" to describe Eastern monks; however, this is incorrect, since the Eastern Church does not have religious orders, as in the West, nor does Eastern monasticism have monastic Rules, as in the West.  History  Monasticism began in the East, and it is in the East that it continues to this day to have the strongest influence on the daily life of the local Christian communities.  The Early Church  The mystical and other-worldly nature of the Christian message very early laid the groundwork for the ascetical life. The example of the Old Testament Prophets, of John the Baptist and of Jesus himself, going into the wilderness to pray and fast set the example that was readily followed by the devout. In the early Christian literature evidence is found of individuals who embraced lives of celibacy and mortification for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven, these individuals were not yet monks, as they had not renounced the world, but lived either in towns or near the outskirts of civilization. We also read of communities of virgins living a common life committed to celibacy and virtue. The accounts of some of these virgins are preserved in the martyrologies of the day.  The Founders  The beginning of monasticism per-se comes right at the end of the Great Persecution of Diocletian, and the founder is Saint Anthony the Great (251 - 356). As a young man he heard the words of the Gospel read in church: If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me (). St. Anthony was among the Desert Fathers - those who left the world to seek God in the silence and seclusion of the Egyptian desert. Around him gathered many disciples, whom he guided in the spiritual life. These first monks were hermits, solitaries who battled temptation alone in the wilderness. As time went on, monks began to congregate into closer communities. Saint Pachomius (ca. 292 - 348) is regarded as the founder of cenobitic monasticism, wherein all live the common life together in a single place under the direction of a single Abbot. The first such monastery was in Tabennisi, Egypt. Saint Theodore of Egypt, the principle disciple of St. Pachomius, succeeded him as head of the monastic community at Tabennisi. He would later go on to found a third type of monastic institution, the skete, as a \\"middle road\\" between anchorites and cenobites. A skete is composed of individual monastic dwellings surrounding a common church. Each monk lives by himself, or with one or two others, coming together only on Sundays and feast days. The rest of the time they spend working and praying alone. On this threefold foundation all subsequent Christian monasticism was built. Coptic monasticism As the birthplace of monasticism, Egypt has continued the monastic tradition unbroken until the present day. After the Council of Chalcedon, the Alexandrian Patriarchate broke communion with those churches which accepted the council, and became what today is known as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Like the Byzantines, monasticism has continued to play a crucial role in the life of the church, and bishops are always chosen from among the ranks of monks. After the Islamic invasion in 639, the Egyptian Christians found themselves dispossessed in their own land. However, despite persecutions and intense pressure to convert, Coptic monasticism has survived, and some of the most ancient monastic communities in the history of Christianity continue to be inhabited to this day. A number of Coptic monasteries have also been established in the New World. Ethiopia was one of the first nations to accept Christianity, officially converting in 341. King Abreha became the first sovereign in the world to engrave the Sign of the Cross on his coins. From the year 341 it was subject to the Patriarch of Alexandria, gaining its independence only in 1959. The church is officially known as the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. In 480 the Nine Saints came from the Mediterranean world to establish Ethiopian monasticism which has continued to flourish despite wars and persecutions. Ancient and inaccessible monasteries are still occupied to this day throughout the Christian regions of the country. The Ethiopian Church also maintains monasteries in the Holy Land, most notably Deir Es-Sultan, on the roof of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Syrian monasticism Nestorian nun The monastics of Armenia, Chaldea, and of the Syrian countries in general were influenced by neither the ecclesiastical nor imperial authority of Byzantium, and continued those observances which were known among them from the time of St. Anthony. Monasticism was very popular in early Syrian and Mesopotamian Christianity, and originally all monks and nuns there were hermits. Members of the covenant, an early monastic community was active since the 3rd century in Edessa and its environs. About 350 Mar Awgin founded the first cenobitic monastery of Mesopotamia on Mt. Izla above the city of Nisibis and monastic communities began to thrive. Under pressure from their Zoroastrian rulers, the Synod of Beth Lapat in 484 declared that the teaching of Nestorius was to be the official doctrine of the Assyrian Church of the East, and decreed that all monks and nuns should marry. This severely weakened the church and spiritual life declined. Some opponents to this decision left altogether and joined the newly established Monophysite church. This decision was reverted in 553, and in 571 Abraham the Great of Kashkar founded a new monastery on Mt. Izla with strict rules. The third abbot of this monastery was his student Babai the Great (551 - 628). Babai finally drove out the married monks from Mt. Izla, and as \\"visitor of the monasteries of the north\\" ensured that the monastic ideal was taken seriously throughout northern Mesopotamia. Syriac Orthodox Church Armenian monasticism 1779 illustration of a Catholic Armenian monk of the Order of St Gregory the Illuminator, united with and wearing the habit of the Dominican Order. In 301, Armenia became the first sovereign nation to officially accept Christianity as a state religion. The Armenian Apostolic Church eventually became a great defender of Armenian nationalism. In 451 the Armenian church rejected the Council of Chalcedon. and today is a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion (not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion). The first Catholicos of the Armenian church was Saint Gregory the Illuminator. St. Gregory soon withdrew to the desert to live as a hermit, and his youngest son, Aristakes, was ordained a Bishop and appointed head of the Armenian Church. In the 5th century, the Sassanid Shah Yazdegerd II tried to impose the Zoroastrian religion on his Christian Armenian subjects. As a result, a rebellion broke out with Vartan Mamikonian as the leader of the rebels. Eventually, the Treaty of Nvarsak (484), guaranteed religious freedom to the Armenians. In 591, the great Byzantine warrior and Emperor Maurice defeated the Persians and recovered much of the remaining territory of Armenia into the empire. The conquest was completed by the Emperor Heraclius in 629. In 645, the Muslim Arab armies of the Caliphate attacked the country, which fell before them. Armenia, which had at times been under the control of its own rulers and at other times been under Persian and Byzantine control, now passed into the hands of the Caliphs. After the fall of the kingdom in 1045, and the subsequent Seljuk conquest of Armenia in 1064, the Armenians established a kingdom in Cilicia, where they established cordial relations with the Europeans and prolonged their existence as an independent entity until 1375. Greater Armenia was later divided between the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Russia. Armenians then suffered in the genocide that was inflicted on them by the Ottomans. As a result, 1.5 million Armenians were killed, and the rest of the Western Armenians were dispersed throughout the world via Syria and Lebanon. Armenia, from then on corresponding to much of Eastern Armenia, once again gained independence in 1918, with the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Armenia, and then in 1991, with the Republic of Armenia. Throughout the waxing and waning of the Armenian's political vicissitudes, monasticism remained a central aspect of their spiritual life. The Armenian church has both married (secular) and monastic (celibate) clergy. Armenian monks follow much the same monastic tradition as the Coptics and Byzantines, but are much stricter in the matter of fasting. The novitiate lasts eight years. A Hieromonk, or celibate priest, declares a vow of celibacy the evening of the same day he is ordained and is given a veghar (), a special head-cover, which symbolizes his renunciation of worldly things. A celibate priest is given the title of Monk ( abegha). Upon successful completion and defense of a written thesis, on a topic of his choosing, the Monk receives the rank of Archimandrite ( vardapet). This indicates that he is a ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù of the Church and receives the right to carry the staff of an Archimandrite. A higher rank of Senior Archimandrite (Dzayraguyn Vardapet) can be granted after completing and defending a doctoral thesis. The rank can only be granted by Bishops who themselves have attained the rank of Senior Archimandrite. The bishops are elected from among those celibate priests who have achieved the rank of archimandrite. Most Armenian bishops live in monasteries. Etchmiadzin, the residence of the Catholikos of all Armenians, is the spiritual center of the Armenian Church. There is also a Catholicos of Cilicia, who resides in Antilyas in Lebanon, and leads the churches belonging to the Holy See of Cilicia. Since 1461 there has been an Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople. The Armenians possess the huge monastery of St. James, the centre of the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem, where their Patriarch of Jerusalem lives, and the convent of Deir asseituni on Mount Zion with numerous nuns. At present, there are three monastic brotherhoods in the Armenian Church: the Brotherhood of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, the Brotherhood of St. James at the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and the Brotherhood of the Holy See of Cilicia. Each Armenian celibate priest becomes a member of the brotherhood in which he has studied and ordained in or under the jurisdiction of which he has served. The brotherhood makes decisions concerning the inner affairs of the monastery. Each brotherhood elects two delegates who take part in the National Ecclesiastical Assembly. The Mechitarists (Armenian: ’Ñ’≠’´’©’°÷Ä’•’°’∂), also spelled Mekhitarists, are a congregation, founded in 1712 by Mechitar, of Armenian Benedictine monks in communion with the Catholic Church. They are best known for their series of scholarly publications of ancient Armenian versions of otherwise lost ancient Greek texts. Byzantine monasticism=St. Basil the Great Saint Basil the Great (c. 330 - 379) is one of the most important influences on both Byzantine and Western monasticism. Before forming his own monastic community, he visited Egypt, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Syria, observing the monastic life and learning both from the positive and negative examples he encountered. He later composed his Asketikon for the members of the monastery he founded about the year 356 on the banks of the Iris river in Cappadocia. St Basil's work entailed two sets of monastic regulations: the Lesser Asketikon and the Greater Asketikon. Correspondence exists between him and St. Gregory Nazianzen which gives further insight into the type of monastic life he established. St. Theodore the Studite St Theodore the Studite: 11th-century mosaic from Nea Moni Monastery, Chios The monks, as a rule, enjoyed the favor of the emperors and patriarchs, but during the iconoclastic persecution they suffered terribly for the orthodoxy of their faith; the stand they took in this aroused the anger of the imperial powers and many were martyred for the faith, monasticism itself (not merely individual monks) became the target of the heretical emperors. Many of them were condemned to exile, and some took advantage of this condemnation to reorganize their religious life in Italy. Ironically, St. John of Damascus, living in a Moslem nation was independent of the iconoclast emperors and could defend the faith from afar. The second half of the 8th century seems to have been a time of very general decadence; but about the year 800 St. Theodore the Studite (c. 758 - c. 826)‚Äîdestined to be one of the most creative names in Eastern monasticism‚Äîbecame abbot of the monastery of St. John the Baptist, called the \\"Studium\\" (founded at Constantinople in the fifth century). He set himself to reform his monastery and restore St. Basil's spirit in its primitive vigour. But to effect this, and to give permanence to the reformation, he saw that there was need of a more practical code of laws to regulate the details of the daily life, as a supplement to St Basil's teachings. He therefore drew up constitutions, afterwards codified, which became the norm of the life at the Studium monastery, and gradually spread thence to the monasteries of the rest of the Eastern Roman Empire. At the same time the monastery was an active center of intellectual and artistic life and a model which exercised considerable influence on monastic observances in the East. Thus to this day the Asketikon of Basil and the Constitutions of Theodore, along with the canons of the Councils, constitute the chief part of Greek and Slavic monastic tradition. Later Byzantine monasticism Russian icon of St. Athanasius the Athonite Monastic life on Mount Athos was founded towards the close of the 10th century through the aid of the Emperor Basil the Macedonian and became the largest and most celebrated of all the monastic centers of the Eastern Roman Empire. The peninsula is actually an independent monastic republic, governed by twenty \\"Sovereign Monasteries\\", with its own elected president (protos) and governing council. Mount Athos is the site of innumerable priceless cultural and spiritual treasures, and up to this day it is considered the capital of Orthodox monasticism. The Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt was inhabited by hermits from the early days of monasticism. But the monastery as it is now was built by order of Emperor Justinian I between 527 and 565, enclosing the Chapel of the Burning Bush which had been built by St. Helena, the mother of St. Constantine the Great, at the site where Moses is supposed to have seen the burning bush. The site has been inhabited by monks ever since and is sacred to three major world religions ‚Äì Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Many sacred icons there escaped the ravages of iconoclasm because of the remoteness of the location. Probably the most well-known item to come from the monastery is the Codex Sinaiticus, a 4th-century manuscript of the Septuagint which is of enormous value for textual research of the scriptures. Notable Byzantine monks include: Icon of St. Gregory Palamas *Leontius of Byzantium (d. 543), author of a treatise against the Nestorians and Eutychians; *St. Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem (d. 638), one of the most vigorous adversaries of the Monothelite heresy;Patrologia Graecae, LXXXVII, 3147‚Äì4014 *St. Maximus the Confessor, Abbot of Chrysopolis (d. 662), the most brilliant representative of Byzantine monasticism in the seventh century, who in his writings and letters steadily combated the partisans of the doctrines of Monothelitism;Patrologia Graecae, XC and XCI. *St. John Damascene (d. 749), together with St. Theodore the Studite defender of the veneration of icons, whose works include theological, ascetic, hagiographical, liturgical, and historical writings;Patrologia Graecae, XCIX. *Saint Gregory Palamas (1296‚Äì1359), who defended the tradition of hesychasm; *Saint Paisius Velichkovsky (1722‚Äì1794), responsible for the renewal of monastic life in the 18th century, on Mount Athos, Romania and Imperial Russia. The Byzantine monasteries furnish a long line of historians who were also monks: John Malalas, whose hronographiaPatrologia Graecae, XCVII, 9‚Äì190. served as a model for Eastern chroniclers; Georgius Syncellus, who wrote a \\"Selected Chronographia\\"; his friend and disciple Theophanes (d. 817), Abbot of the \\"Great Field\\" near Cyzicus, the author of another Chronographia;Patrologia Graecae, CVIII. the Patriarch Nikephoros, who wrote (815 ‚Äì 829) an historical Breviarium (a Byzantine history), and an \\"Abridged Chronographia\\";Patrologia Graecae, C, 879‚Äì991. George the Monk, whose Chronicle stops at 842 AD.Patrologia Graecae, CX. There were, besides, a large number of monks, hagiographers, hymnologists, and poets who had a large share in the development of the Greek Liturgy. Among the authors of hymns may be mentioned: St. Maximus the Confessor; St. Theodore the Studite; St. Romanus the Melodist; St. Andrew of Crete; St. John Damascene; Cosmas of Jerusalem, and St. Joseph the Hymnographer. Fine penmanship and the copying of manuscripts were held in honor among the Byzantines. Among the monasteries which excelled in the art of copying were the Studium, Mount Athos, the monastery of the Isle of Patmos and that of Rossano in Sicily; the tradition was continued later by the monastery of Grottaferrata near Rome. These monasteries, and others as well, were studios of religious art where the monks toiled to produce miniatures, manuscripts, paintings, and goldsmith work. The triumph of Orthodoxy over the iconoclastic heresy infused an extraordinary enthusiasm into this branch of their labors. Byzantine monasticism in Ukraine Univ Holy Dormition Lavra, near Peremyshlyany Vilna Holy Trinity Monastery in Vilnius150px Following the Union of Brest and partitions of Poland, the Ruthenian Church was catholicized and later dissolved by the Russian authorities. All of its property including churches and monasteries were transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church. The remaining eparchies of the Ruthenian Church that were kept by the Austrian Empire were reorganized into the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Following the Union Brest which catholicized the Ruthenian Church, there was established a religious order of Basilians by Jazep Rutsky. In 20th century Andrey Sheptytskyi revived another religious orders of Studites. Both orders follow Byzantine-rite monasticism.

It is located on the east side of East Lake Tohopekaliga. The only major road which runs through Narcoossee is County Road 15, commonly referred to as Narcoossee Road, which connects to U.S. Route 192. Every May, the community holds the annual Battle at Narcoossee Mill, which is a Civil War reenactment. History Narcoossee began in the late 19th century as a settlement by E. Nelson Fell, on a huge tract of land on the shore of East Lake Tohopekaliga. The town name is derived from the Creek Indian word for \\"black bear.\\" English settlers began to arrive in 1883, drawn by newspaper advertisements extolling the virtues of the area and its citrus groves, promising an annual income of $10,000 once the groves matured. In 1888 the St. Cloud & Sugar Belt Railway (later renamed the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) came through the town area, expanding the citrus shipping possibilities and improving the local economy. One of the prominent English citizens built Saint Peter's Episcopal Church which opened in 1898. After a series of hard freezes in the 1890s that wiped out citrus groves and a severe drought in 1908, many settlers gave up and left the area. In 1910, Fell acquired title to in Indian River County, founded the town of Fellsmere, and took many of the Narcoossee settlers with him. Only two families remained and the church closed. In 1930 the church building was dismantled and moved to St. Cloud where it was joined to the existing church there becoming the church of St Luke and St Peter. Like the Central Florida area around it, population growth has spread to Narcoosee both from Orlando and from St Cloud with housing developments springing up. The heart of the 'town' rests at the blinking light which is the intersection of Jones Road and Highway 15, also known as Narcoossee Road.

The Commissioners are the chief executive and legislative officials of the County, which has 500,000 residents spread over and an annual County budget of $300 million. Henderson was elected in 2003 to a four-year term and was the lone Democrat on the Board of Commissioners in a County where Republicans outnumber Democrats two to one. Henderson was previously Head of Public Health for the City of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the County seat. Henderson was not re-elected as Lancaster County Commissioner on November 7, 2007. Henderson was succeeded by Craig Lehman as the minority Commissioner. Other careers She is a former high school and college teacher, holding a doctorate degree from Temple University, a master's degree from West Chester University and her B.S. from James Madison University. Henderson is also a Respiratory Therapist and worked at Lancaster General Hospital prior to her teaching and government careers. Henderson‚Äôs book Pressed: Public Money, Private Profit - A Cautionary Tale tells the story of the development, building, and financing of the Lancaster County Convention Center and Marriott Hotel in downtown Lancaster. The highly controversial ‚Äúconvention center project,‚Äù as it was known to those in Lancaster County (pop. 510,000), was originally proposed in 1999 as a $75 million ‚Äúpublic- private‚Äù partnership. The project included a publicly owned convention center ($30 million) and a privately-owned hotel ($45 million). By the time the convention center and hotel opened in 2009, the project‚Äôs cost had ballooned to more than $170 million, with more than 90% of the total cost of both the convention center and hotel borne by Pennsylvania taxpayers. Political views Henderson is a notable opponent of the Lancaster County Convention Center Authority's controversial $170 million hotel/convention center in downtown Lancaster on the site of the former Watt & Shand building. The project's supporters believe it would promote the revitalization of the city's center. Its opponents, however, feel it poses an unacceptable risk to taxpayers. The hotel portion of the project is owned 50% by Lancaster Newspapers, Inc. which have been accused of using their monopoly print position in the County to promote the project and stifle opposition. Henderson has been referenced in more than 2,200 newspaper articles, over 700 of which concern the Lancaster County Convention Center project, many of them attacking her position.

He is the academic inspiration behind The Hermetic Code (2007) and the author of Astana: Architecture, Myth, and Destiny (2017). Albo is currently an Adjunct Professor of History at the University of Winnipeg where he specializes in architecture, Freemasonry, and the Western esoteric tradition. For his discoveries into the Freemasonic symbolism of the Manitoba Legislative Building recounted in The Hermetic Code, Albo has been dubbed \\"Canada's Dan Brown\\" and \\"one of Winnipeg's foremost architectural historians\\". Since 2009, Albo has led the Hermetic Code Tours of the Manitoba Legislative Building, which more than 45,000 people have attended. Early life and education Albo grew up in the West End of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in religion and anthropology at the University of Winnipeg in 2002. He continued his studies at the University of Toronto, where he was awarded a Master of Arts (MA) degree in ancient Near Eastern civilizations following completion of a thesis entitled Nebuchadrezzar and the Stars: A New Perspective of the Theophany in the Book of Habakkuk 3:3‚Äì13. He acquired a second MA degree in Hermetic philosophy and related currents at the University of Amsterdam in 2006. His thesis was entitled Ritualist Revival: Fin de si√®cle Esotericism and the Oxford Movement. He started attending Peterhouse, University of Cambridge, in 2007, where he attained his Master of Philosophy degree in the history of art in 2008 with the thesis Charles Robert Cockerell and his Theories of Gothic Proportions from his Lectures at the Royal Academy and then a Doctor of Philosophy degree in the history of architecture in 2012 with the thesis Freemasonry and the Nineteenth-Century British Gothic Revival. Publications=Hermetic Code The Manitoba Legislative Building In 2001, Albo began his decade-long research into the Freemasonic and Hermetic symbolism of the Manitoba Legislative Building after noticing two Egyptian sphinxes on the building's roof. Albo received government funding and support to conduct extensive research and freely explore the building, which enabled him to uncover its esoteric principles of design. This included hidden hieroglyphic inscriptions and the architect's emulation of Solomon's Temple, and the architect's use of sacred geometry, and numerological codes, including the golden ratio, the Fibonacci sequence, and a tribute to the numbers \\"666\\" and \\"13\\". Albo concluded that British architect Frank Worthington Simon, himself a Freemason, had designed the edifice as \\"a temple [to Hermetic wisdom] masquerading as a government building.\\" Albo's discoveries became the basis for Carolin Vesely and Buzz Currie's 2007 book The Hermetic Code, which was published by the Winnipeg Free Press and is now on its fourth printing. Since 2009, Albo has led the Hermetic Code Tours through the Manitoba Legislative Building, which more than 25,000 have taken. In 2011, the Canadian Tourism Commission announced that it had added the Hermetic Code Tour to its list of premiere destinations as part of its international tourism campaign. Writing about the Hermetic Code Tour in The Sydney Morning Herald, Max Anderson says, \\"Frank Albo ‚Äì a highly charismatic polymath ‚Äì leads one of the very best tours of any public building anywhere in the world.\\" Astana: Architecture, Myth & Destiny Albo has continued his research into esoteric matters with his 2017 book Astana: Architecture, Myth & Destiny. In this work, he posits that the architecture of Astana, Kazakhstan, dubbed the \\"Illuminati Capital of the World\\", encodes a solution to the three greatest threats of the 21st century: religious extremism, environmental destruction, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The book also conceals an armchair treasure hunt called the Astana Challenge, an enigma of secrets and mysteries that when solved reveals a hidden message. The first person to decipher its exact wording will win an all-expense-paid luxury vacation to Astana valued at $30,000.

The Shire covers an area of , and its seat of government is the town of Leonora. History Leonora was originally part of the North Coolgardie Road District when that entity was gazetted in 1898. The town of Leonora was gazetted as the Municipality of Leonora with its own mayor in 1900. The Shire of Leonora originated from the Mount Malcolm Road District, which was established on 31 May 1912, when the North Coolgardie Road District was abolished and broken up into three separate road districts: Mount Malcolm, Kookynie and Menzies. (The North Coolgardie Road District had absorbed three municipalities in March 1912, including the Municipality of Malcolm; however, the amalgamation had not been successful.) Mount Malcolm absorbed the Municipality of Leonora on 1 July 1917 and became the Leonora- Mount Malcolm Road District. Effective 1 July 1917. On 16 August 1929, a neighbouring district, the Lawlers Road District, was dissolved and split between Mount Margaret (later Laverton) and Leonora-Mount Malcolm. The Leonora-Mt-Malcolm Road District was renamed the Leonora Road District on 20 June 1930. On 1 July 1961, it became the Shire of Leonora under the Local Government Act 1960, which reformed all remaining road districts into shires.

The diocese hails from the Provisional Administration of Russian Parishes in Western Europe, created in 1921. At the time of the creation of the exarchate, the diocese comprised Russian Orthodox parishes that were under administration of the Russian √©migr√© bishop Eulogius Georgiyevsky. The latter decided to switch under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate as he was unwilling to continue his administrative subordination to the Moscow Patriarchate, then under full control of the Soviet State, nor was he willing to recognize the authority of the Yugoslavia-based Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, then headed by Anthony (Khrapovitsky). In 1931, Metropolitan Eulogius, along with the clergy and laity who supported him, was admitted to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople; these parishes received the status of a temporary Exarchate in Western Europe, which was abolished in 1965. After that, until 1971, this Association existed as the \\"Orthodox Archdiocese of France and Western Europe and Russian Western European churches of diaspora\\". In 1971, the Archdiocese was again accepted into the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. New reorganization was implemented on 19 June 1999, when Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople created the exarchate by granting it a tomos. 27 November 2018 Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople abolish tomos of 1999; the former exarchate's parishes were instructed to join the relevant dioceses of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Archdiocese, whose legally binding Statute (Article 11) expressly says that its primate must be a bishop of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, continues to exist as a legal entity, nevertheless. Having voted to continue as a legal entity in February 2019, the Archdiocese as an entity failed to pass a resolution to switch to the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Moscow on 28 September 2019 as was proposed by its primate Archbishop , who had personally joined the Moscow Patriarchate. 7 October 2019 Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Moscow confirmed the acceptance of clerics and parishes \\"who expressed such a desire\\". Not all parishes and clerics of the former Exarchate followed Archbishop John, joining various jurisdictions such as the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of France (under the Ecumenical Patriarchate), the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Bulgarian Orthodox ChurchBomben fra Konstantinopel, 14 October 2019 - Orthodox Church of Denmark[http://www.ryskaortodoxakyrkan.se/3/budskap.html ¬µMessage from the Bulgarian patriarch of America, Canada and Australia], Swedish translation, at the parish website of Kristi f√∂rklaring Orthodox parish in Stockholm, dated the Sunday of Orthodoxy, 2019 and the Serbian Orthodox Church. History During the 19th century, several parishes were created for the Russian diaspora in various countries of Western Europe, under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1861, Alexander Nevsky Church was built in Paris, and soon became the main regional center of Russian Orthodoxy. Within the Russian Orthodox Church, jurisdiction over parishes in Western Europe was granted to the Metropolitan of Saint Petersburg. After the onset of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, Russian Orthodox Christians based outside Russia, and those who fled there from the communist regime, found themselves in a very difficult situation. In 1920, Metropolitan Eulogius (Georgiyevsky) was sent to Western Europe in order to organize provisional administration. His jurisdiction was confirmed on 8 April 1921, by Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow and Metropolitan Benjamin of Petersburg, who issued a decree creating the Provisional Administration of Russian Parishes in Western Europe, centered in Paris, and appointing Metropolitan Eulogius as its first hierarch. Faced with new political realities in Russia, and severe restrictions imposed by the Soviet regime upon the Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Eulogius and other exiled Russian hierarchs found a temporary solution in the formation of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR). During the early 1920s, the vast majority of Russian Orthodox Christians in diaspora supported ROCOR, united in their opposition to the Soviet government. At first, Metropolitan Eulogius was member of the ROCOR Synod, but in 1927 he came into conflict with the majority of ROCOR hierarchs and was subsequently suspended by them. In order to remove Metropolitan Eulogius from his office, ROCOR hierarchs decided to replace him with Metropolitan Seraphim (Lukyanov), but great majority of parishes in Western Europe remained loyal to Metropolitan Eulogius. Thus a split was created within the Russian community in Western Europe, between those who continued to follow Metropolitan Eulogius and those who recognized Metropolitan Seraphim as their new hierarch. Faced with those challenges, Metropolitan Eulogius appealed the Moscow Patriarchate, and received confirmation of his jurisdiction in Western Europe. In 1930, Metropolitan Sergius (Stragorodsky), acting as locum tenens of the Russian Patriarchal Throne, initiated proceedings against Metropolitan Eulogius because of his public support for Christians suffering under the Soviet regime. On 10 June 1930, a decree was issued, intended to remove Metropolitan Eulogius from his office, and replace him with Metropolitan Vladimir (Tikhonicky). Decree failed, on both accounts, since both hierarchs decided not to obey it. Moscow responded by sending another hierarch, Metropolitan Eleutherius (Bogoyavlensky), who arrived in Paris at the beginning of 1931. Faced with new jurisdictional crisis, second in four years, majority of parishes decided to remain loyal to Metropolitan Eulogius, while minority recognized Metropolitan Eleutherius. Since there also was another group, created earlier (1927) under Metropolitan Seraphim, Russian diaspora in Western Europe found itself divided into three fractions, headed by Eleutherius (Moscow), Seraphim (ROCOR) and Eulogius (independent). Under the Church of Constantinople Russian Orthodox Metropolitan Eulogius (Georgiyevsky) In order to regulate his canonical position, Metropolitan Eulogius petitioned Patriarch Photius II of Constantinople, asking to be received under his canonical care. On 17 February 1931, he was appointed an exarch, with provisional jurisdiction over Russian parishes in Western Europe, and thus a provisional exarchate of the Ecumenical Patriarchate was created. That action caused a direct conflict between two Patriarchates (Constantinople and Moscow), leading to exchange of protests and accusations, without resolution. Metropolitan Eulogius remained under the jurisdiction of Constantinople until 1944, when he decided to lead his community back into the Moscow Patriarchate. Reunion was formalized in 1945, but many important questions remained unsolved. However, after his death in 1946, a further break occurred in 1947, with a large number of parishes once again entering the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Provisional Exarchate was closed by Patriarch Athenagoras I through a letter dated 22 November 1965, with an assembly meeting 16‚Äì18 February 1966 noting that such provisional ethnic structures were no longer necessary, given that the passage of several generations had allowed immigrants to become accustomed to their new lands, which were now made up of more and more converts to the faith. The implementation of those decisions was challenged, and subsequently reconsidered. On 22 January 1971, the same Patriarch Athenagoras I regulated the position of the Archdiocese, under the Omophorion of the Patriarch of Constantinople, recognising its internal autonomy. New reorganization was implemented on 19 June 1999, when Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople created the exarchate by granting it a tomos. According to the Exarchate's own account, Patriarch Bartholomew \\"recognised the full autonomy of the Archdiocese in administrative, pastoral and material terms\\". On 8 June 2006 the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople received Bishop Basil (Osborne) along with a number of parishes and clergy in the United Kingdom from Moscow Patriarchate's Diocese of Sourozh. This act was caused substantial controversy, as he had not been released from the Moscow Patriarchate. The same statement gave Bishop Basil the new title, Bishop of Amphipolis (taken from an ancient see in Greece that no longer has a bishop), and charged him with the care of parishes in Great Britain and Ireland, as auxiliary bishop under Archbishop Gabriel of Komana in Paris. 9 June 2006 the Council of the Archdiocese during an extraordinary meeting created the Episcopal Vicariate of Great Britain and IrelandSee details under . At that time, no such parishes existed. After his appointment a number of parishes and communities, as well as some of the clergy and laity of the Diocese of Sourozh, followed Bishop Basil into the Archdiocese and came to constitute the Episcopal Vicariate. Other parishes and communities were formed later, where none had previously existed, for example in Cumbria, and Northampton. Since the retirement of its bishop on 12 October 2009, it has become a Deanery within the Archdiocese. The formal name has become the Deanery of Great Britain and Ireland within the Archdiocese of Orthodox Parishes of Russian Tradition in Western Europe. Disbandment by the Ecumenical Patriarchate and aftermath On 27 November 2018, the Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate decided unanimously to dissolve its exarchate of the Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox churches in Western Europe. According to communiqu√©, the Ecumenical Patriarchate \\"decided to revoke the patriarchal tomos of 1999 by which it granted pastoral care and administration of orthodox parishes of Russian tradition in Western Europe to His Archbishop-Exarch. [...] [T]he ecumenical patriarchate has decided to integrate and connect parishes to the various holy Metropolises of the ecumenical patriarchate in the countries where they are located.\\" On 23 February, the AROCWE held its Extraordinary General Assembly (EGA). 191 out of the 206 voters voted against the dissolution, 15 voted in favor of the dissolution. A new assembly may possibly be held in June to choose a jurisdiction. After the vote, Archbishop John of Charioupolis read a letter that Archbishop Anthony of Vienna and Budapest, head of the Moscow Patriarchate's Synodal Department for the Administration of Institutions Abroad, had written. In his letter, Anthony wrote that the Russian Orthodox Church was ready to receive the AROCWE under its jurisdiction. Following the assembly, the AROCWE published a communiqu√© that said: \\"For the moment, the life of the Archdiocese continues as on the eve of the EGA. In celebrations, the Archbishop commemorates the Ecumenical Patriarch and the parish clergy commemorate the Archbishop according to the canonical rule.\\" On 14 September, Archbishop personally joined the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate, and the ROC granted him the title of Archbishop of Dubna. According to the Russian media, the change of jurisdiction also applied to the clergymen subordinated to him and parishes that were willing to join the Moscow Patriarchate. Structure and composition As of December 2019, the Archdiocese comprised 67 monasteries, parishes, and communities. The AROCWE is financially independent. Perhaps the best known institution of the Archdiocese was the St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute, founded in 1925 by Metropolitan Eulogius and sometime home of several well-known Orthodox theologians and writers of the twentieth century, including Georges Florovsky, Alexander Schmemann and John Meyendorff (although not Vladimir Lossky, who neither taught at St. Sergius nor was a member of the Archdiocese, himself remaining loyal to the Moscow Patriarchate).

Early life Robinson was born in Denaby Main, Conisbrough, near Doncaster, Yorkshire. His Christian names, Ellis Pembroke, derived from his mother, a cockney housemaid who worked for a Cambridgeshire family called Ellis Merry who was a college servant at Pembroke College. \\"My mum had played cricket on Parker's Piece, where Jack Hobbs had played, and I can't remember when I didn't play the game,\\" he told Nigel Pullan in an interview in 1996. Robinson learned his cricket at his Denaby club and was sent to Bramall Lane, Sheffield, for George Hirst to assess. He began as a promising wicketkeeper batsman but ‚Äì \\"There was no room to keep wicket so, anxious to impress Mr Hirst, I bowled a few quick leg- breaks and googlies.\\" He was invited to the famous \\"winter shed\\" at Headingley and told, in true Yorkshire fashion, to forget the leg breaks and concentrate on off spin. Yorkshire had Hedley Verity to spin the ball away from the bat and needed an off spinner as variation as the great George Macaulay was coming to the end of his career. Yorkshire Robinson made his Yorkshire debut at Worcester in 1934 against Worcestershire, taking 4‚Äì31 and watching the 18-year-old Len Hutton score 196, his first century. He did not establish himself in the strong Yorkshire team until 1937 when he took 78 wickets at an average of 22.55. He snared 104 wickets in 1940 and 120First-class Bowling in Each Season by Ellis Robinson in the last season before the war and spent six years in the R.A.F. during the war. He was given a Test trial in 1946 when he took 149 wickets and believed he should have been included in Wally Hammond's doomed team to Australia that following winter: \\"I turned the ball more than most off-spinners and I think I would have been effective in Australia.\\" The Australians rated him too, Ian Johnson, Australia's premier off-spinner, sought Robinson's advice when touring England in 1948. As a batsman, following a strong order, Robinson's normal brief was to score quickly. He lifted Claude Lewis, the Kent left-arm spinner and later county scorer, over the roof of the football stand at Headingley, put Dick Howorth of Worcestershire out of Park Avenue, Bradford and into Horton Park, and Johnnie Clay of Glamorgan out of the Arms Park in Cardiff. He usually fielded at first slip and was as sharp a catcher as any in the county game, taking 265 catches in all. He usually had the dour Arthur Mitchell alongside him at second slip, a partnership that produced a story that will live with Robinson's memory. Before a packed crowd at Headingley, he took a one-handed catch that involved a leap, a dive and ended with a double somersault. As Robinson struggled to his feet, grinning and holding the ball high to acknowledge the cheers of the crowd, Mitchell ‚Äì \\"grim as a piece of stone from Baildon Moor\\" according to Herbert Sutcliffe ‚Äì muttered from the side of his mouth: \\"Gerrup. Tha's makkin' an exhibition o' thissen.\\" Robinson spent most of his playing career under the tough captaincy of Brian Sellers, who won six championships in eight seasons. \\"I got a rollicking in my first match for putting my foot on the ball. In my first season, my spinning finger was so worn it was bleeding but Mr Sellers said I had to keep going and bowled me into the wind all day.\\" In that match, at Bristol, Robinson took 2‚Äì168 as Hammond stroked 143. \\"You were only paid if you played and I was never sure of my place. As an uncapped player I got pounds 7 or pounds 8 a match but had to pay my own travel and hotel expenses.\\" Somerset and later life After the 1949 season, with Ray Illingworth emerging, Robinson was released to spend three summers with Somerset, for whom he played wearing his fading old white rose cap. He remained an effective bowler to the end, taking 102 wickets in 1951. In 301 first-class matches in all he took 1009 wickets at just 22.58 with a best of 8 for 35 against Lancashire in the Roses Match. He also took 8 wickets in an innings against Surrey and Sussex. He took 5 wickets in an innings 61 times and 12 wickets in a match on 12 occasions. Batting left-handed, he scored 3,492 runs at 11.01 with a highest score of 75* for Yorkshire against Gloucestershire. Despite taking over a thousand first-class wickets Robinson was never selected for England though he spun the ball and extracted bounce on most surfaces. He bowled most of his overs from around the wicket, angling the ball across the right-hander and spinning it sharply back in. Like so many cricketers, he lost his best years to the Second World War. After retiring from the first-class game he returned to Yorkshire and resumed his links with the Denaby club for whom he had first played as a youngster. He was belatedly honoured by Yorkshire by being made an Honorary Life Member in 1982. He died suddenly on 10 November 1998 at his home in Conisbrough, while he was dressing to play golf. He was 87 years old and the last surviving player from Yorkshire's all- conquering side of the 1930s. Family His uncle George Robinson played first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire.

The BX was built at Soda Creek in early 1910 by Alexander Watson Jr, of Victoria, who was one of British Columbia's foremost shipbuilders and the son of the man who had built the Charlotte. The BC Express Company also hired Captain Owen Forrester Browne to be the master of the BX as he was the most experienced upper Fraser River pilot. Construction Captain Browne worked with Alexander Watson throughout the design and construction phases of the BX. Watson purchased the BX's boiler, engines and other equipment from the Chicago Marine Ironworks Company, who were informed that the BX's construction site at Soda Creek was away from the railway at Ashcroft and therefore the equipment would have to be hauled by horse drawn freighters for that distance. Chicago Marine decided to build the boiler in sections, the heaviest piece was less than , so it was easily transported to the construction site. They also supplied two compound condensing engines for the BX which would use half the fuel of a single engine of similar power. These engines gave the BX an enormous advantage over the other sternwheelers that were on the river at this time, as it cut down on both the labor needed to load the wood and the cargo space required to carry it.It was later estimated that these engines saved the BX a sum equal to the amount of her construction, $54,531.33. RMS BX under construction in 1910 For the hull, Watson turned to local man, William Lyne, who was a portable sawmill operator.Lyne was instructed to find a good stand of fir and cut the necessary timbers and planks. Intending to build a steamer with the lightest draught possible, Watson built the rest of the BX out of first grade cedar, shipped up from Victoria. Construction began in February when Watson arrived with a crew of fifty carpenters, joiners and labourers and work was begun on the hull. At the end of March, a near catastrophe occurred. The ice on the Fraser suddenly broke up and piled up at Soda Creek Canyon, a quarter mile from the BX's construction site. The river overflowed its banks and chunks of ice were deposited all over the site. The rushing water knocked the BX off its blocks and swept many of the tools and supplies out of the warehouse and down into the river. Luckily the workers had heard the ice breaking up in the canyon and had been able to scramble to higher ground and safety. When the floodwaters receded, Watson was able to inspect the BX and found that the only damage done was some twisted and broken timbers that were quickly replaced. The company swiftly shipped up the replacement tools and supplies from Ashcroft and work resumed once more. When the BX was completed, she had three decks, with stateroom accommodation for 70 passengers and could also carry another 60 deck passengers. The staterooms featured steam heat, hot and cold running water, fine quality bedding and attractive wall and floor coverings. Her dining room could seat 50 and was lavishly furnished, right down to the plates, which were specially ordered from England and monogrammed in the BX Company's colors: red, yellow and white. Off the ladies cabin above the covered paddlewheel a bridal chamber was built, which contained, among other luxuries, a double brass bed and a silk eiderdown worth $150. Many dignitaries, including Premier Richard McBride would travel in the comfort of this sumptuous suite. Maiden voyage The BX was launched at Soda Creek on Friday May 13, 1910, without ceremony. Many people of a superstitious bent, especially the shipyard workers, criticized Watson and Browne for choosing to launch a ship on a Friday the 13th. The BC Express Company mollified the workers by explaining that it was the company's lucky day. Watson and Browne were pleased with how the BX sat in the water, her draught was only at the bow and at her deepest part. Even fully loaded, with a hundred tons of freight, she only sat 30 inches into the water. She left Soda Creek for her first trip upstream on May 23, leaving at the break of day and arriving in Quesnel at 11 am. Captain Browne made semi-weekly trips between Quesnel and Soda Creek until June 23 when he decided that the BX was ready for testing in the two canyons between Quesnel and Fort George, the Cottonwood Canyon and the Fort George Canyon. He left Quesnel at 1pm and upon arriving at the Cottonwood Canyon, offloaded the passengers and lined through using the steam capstan. However, Browne soon realized that the light and powerful BX did not need to line through and could run the canyons unaided. By law passengers were forced to disembark and walk around any canyon that a steamer was lining through and be picked up on the other side. However, by the fall of 1910, the federal steamboat inspector decided that the BX was allowed to keep her passengers on board. This gave her a huge advantage over her rivals, all of which had to line through both canyons, wasting time and fuel as well as inconveniencing the passengers. The BX arrived in South Fort George on June 24, to a warm welcome from the local populace. The steamer landing on the Fraser had been there since 1909 and was already used by the Charlotte, Chilco and Quesnel. Nevertheless, local residents had been anticipating the day of the BX's arrival to see where the company would choose to have its landing and where it would build its office and warehouse. Many local business decisions were going to be based on this, as it was widely and correctly assumed that the BX would be bringing up the bulk of the passengers and landseekers from the south. One businessman, hotelier Al Johnson, was waiting for this information so he would know where to build Fort George's first licensed hotel, the Hotel Northern. The promoters of South Fort George were well aware of the huge benefit it would be to have the landing at their town-site, so the day after the BX arrived they offered the BC Express Company free lots of their choice in South Fort George. The company accepted the offer and construction on the facilities was begun. This would be a huge disappointment to South Fort George's rival town-site, Central Fort George on the Nechako River, which had hoped for the BC Express's landing and offices for itself. George Hammond, the promoter for Central, made the best he could out of a bad situation and hired a representative for the Central town-site and had him travel on the BX and promote Central to the passengers before they arrived in South Fort George. The route Once the BX had been successfully tested in the canyons, she began a semi-weekly passenger and mail service from Soda Creek to Fort George. The BX would meet the company horse stages or automobiles at Soda Creek and would leave at 3am on Sundays and Wednesdays, arriving in Quesnel at noon, offload cargo and passengers and continue upriver until dark. The next day she would start again at dawn and arrive in Fort George around 11am. The return trips downriver were much faster, the BX would leave Fort George on Tuesdays and Saturdays at 7am and arrive in Soda Creek at 4pm the same day. She made good speed through the canyons, often as fast as . In 1910, the stage fare from Ashcroft to Soda Creek was $27.50, steamer fare from there to Fort George was $17.50, meals were 75 cents and berths, $1.50. Along the route, if a settler needed the BX to stop, they simply raised a white flag along the riverbank and the steamer would pull over and land. A white flag was never ignored, it might only be a settler wanting to ship some produce to market, or it could be a sick child that needed emergency transportation to a hospital. Late in 1910, the BX fulfilled a heroic role. The Chilco had been on its way up from Quesnel to Fort George in late November with Fort George's winter food supply when it met with an accident just above the Cottonwood Canyon and the food had to be transported back to Quesnel. When news of this reached Fort George, pioneers Al Johnson and Russell Peden snow-shoed down to Quesnel to petition Captain Browne to make one last run with the BX with the necessary supplies. By then ice had begun to form along the river, but Captain Browne consented and brought the BX to Fort George, without as much as a scratch on her paint. 1911 was a busy year as more settlers poured into the district, and in 1912, the BX was joined by her sister ship, the BC Express, which under the command of Captain Joseph Bucey, had been built for service on the Fort George to T√™te Jaune Cache section of the upper Fraser. However, that year the Fraser was very low and all the sternwheelers had trouble. The BX rammed the same rock twice in the Fort George Canyon, until her crew, in case of frustrated over-exuberance, dynamited the offending boulder, thereby breaking every window in the BX in the process. But 1912 also brought some very good news for all the local river steamers, and the area in general. It was announced that another railway was going to be built, the Pacific Great Eastern which would run from Vancouver to Fort George and eventually beyond to the Peace River Country. Foley, Welch and Stewart would be the contractors for this railway as well and they planned to build the grade along the upper Fraser River from Fort George to Soda Creek so that sternwheelers could be used to aid in its construction. In 1914, the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific was finished and construction on the Pacific Great Eastern began and the Foley, Welch and Stewart boats, the Operator and the Conveyor joined the BX and the BC Express on the route between Soda Creek and Fort George. By then, the rivalry between the FW&S; boats and the BC Express boats was quite heated and it soon came down to a race. The Conveyor had proved itself to be swifter than its sister ship Operator, as had the BX proven swifter than the BC Express, so one day in July, the Conveyor's Captain Shannon challenged Captain Browne to a race to Quesnel from Soda Creek. The rules were rather odd, as the BX was still obligated to stop and deliver her mail at several different landings whereas the Conveyor had no such obligation and could run right through. As the race progressed, it soon became obvious to all that the BX was the faster boat, as she had stayed ahead for most of the race, despite having to stop several times. At one landing the BX had more mail to deliver than usual and had fallen behind the Conveyor, but she soon caught up and was passing her opponent when Captain Johnson rammed the BX with the Conveyor. Captain Browne immediately pulled over to inspect his boat for damages and the Conveyor pulled ahead again. Fortunately Browne soon discovered that the Conveyor had hit the BX just where the shear of her guards met and that there was no serious damage. In fact, when Browne arrived in Quesnel, he had almost caught up with the Conveyor again. When the full tale was heard by the local populace, it was unanimously agreed that the BX was the winner and she was declared the \\"Speed Queen of the Fraser\\". Captain Shannon, meanwhile was apologetic, and had stated that he just got caught up in the moment. That would be the last race on the upper Fraser River, because that August would bring the onset of World War I and the halting of construction of the Pacific Great Eastern. The end of an era BX sunk at Woodpecker 1919 In 1915, only the BX was used on the upper Fraser River, with the BC Express reserved for special trips. Despite having a monopoly on river traffic, the BX finished the season with a $7000 loss. In 1916 and 1917, sternwheelers were not used on the river at all. In 1918, after an appeal from the Quesnel Board of Trade, the provincial government granted the BC Express Company a $10,000 per year subsidy to continue river navigation from Soda Creek to Fort George. The BX ran until August 30, 1919, when she was punctured by an infamous rock called the \\"Woodpecker\\" and sank with a 100 tons of bagged cement intended for construction of the Deep Creek Bridge. The BC Express Company, fully intending to salvage their prized craft, hired Alexander Watson Jr to rush up from Victoria to overhaul the BC Express, which had been out of service since 1915, so she could go rescue the BX. However, out at the site of the accident, it was discovered that the bags of cement had solidified and had to be separated before the BX could be raised and the salvage could not be completed before freeze-up. In the spring of 1920, the salvage work was completed and at a cost of $40,000 the BX was raised and patched sufficiently to get her back to Fort George. The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon. That it could be accomplished was a fitting testament to the craftsmanship of Alexander Watson Jr and the skill of Captain Browne and Captain Bucey. The BC Express ran until November 1920 and then it joined the BX on the riverbank at Fort George, where their hulls were abandoned. In a sense, they lived on, as their engines and equipment were shipped to Northern Alberta to work on the Mackenzie River for the Alberta and Arctic Transportation Company.

Promoted as \\"the world‚Äôs longest art gallery\\", the canyon is known for its extensive rock art, most of it created by the Fremont culture and the Ute people. The rock art, shelters, and granaries left behind by the Fremont make Ninemile Canyon a destination for archaeologists and tourists alike. The canyon became a main transport corridor in the region during the 1880s. Settlers established a number of ranches in Ninemile Canyon, and even a short-lived town named Harper. No longer heavily traveled, the rugged canyon road was used mostly for recreation and tourism through the end of the 20th century. The discovery of rich deposits of natural gas deep beneath the West Tavaputs Plateau has brought an influx of industrial truck traffic since 2002. The large amounts of fugitive dust produced by the trucks' passage may be damaging the rock art. Public debate is ongoing about how best to balance energy development in the canyon against the preservation of its cultural resources. Geography Ninemile Canyon (the dark green area at the bottom) at North Franks Canyon. An array of natural gas wells is visible in the distance, May 2019. Ninemile Canyon runs roughly southwest to northeast, with numerous winding turns, just to the north of the Book Cliffs, and south and east of Ashley National Forest. The full canyon route, formerly SR‚Äë53 through Gate Canyon, connects the towns of Wellington and Myton. Nine Mile Creek, the stream that formed the canyon, is by no means a major body of water. Its importance lies in the fact that it is one of the few water sources in the region that are reliable year-round, and it has been so since prehistoric times. Nine Mile Creek is actually a minor tributary of the Green River, emptying into Desolation Canyon on the east. A number of tributary canyons branch off Ninemile Cayon itself, including Argyle Canyon, Cottonwood Canyon, Minnie Maud, and Dry Canyon. Significant rock art sites are frequently located near the junctions where they meet the main canyon. Archaeology The famous Cottonwood Panel, also called The Great Hunt, May 2006 There are at least an estimated 1,000 rock art sites in the canyon, with more than 10,000 individual images. The true figures may be ten times as high, but there is no question that rock art is more concentrated here than anywhere else in North America. Much is in the form of pecked petroglyphs, and there are many painted pictographs as well. Researchers have also identified hundreds of pit-houses, rock shelters, and granaries, although only a limited amount of excavation has been carried out. Many of these structures are located high above the canyon floor on cliff ledges, pinnacles, and mesas. They were built by the Fremont, whose presence in Ninemile Canyon has been dated at AD 950‚Äì1250. Indeed, Ninemile Canyon was one of the locations most heavily occupied by the Fremont. In contrast to the purely hunter-gatherer cultures that surrounded them, the Fremont practiced agriculture, growing corn and squash along the canyon bottom. Compared to other Fremont areas, relatively little pottery is found in Nine Mile, suggesting that beans, which must be boiled for hours to become edible, were not an important part of the local diet. The Fremont left irrigation ditches and earthen lodges on the canyon floor that could be seen as late as the 1930s, but are no longer visible after generations of modern cultivation. The prints under this bison's hooves indicate Ute origin, November 2007. By the 16th century the ancestral Utes were in the canyon. They added to the rock art already on the walls, but in styles of their own. Many scenes, for example, depict Ute hunters on horseback and date to the 1800s. Despite the number of Ute artifacts found in Nine Mile, there is no archaeological evidence of any Ute camps or residences. Archaeological sites Stone shelter at Redman Village, April 2007 In 2009, 63 archaeological sites in the canyon were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, 36 in Carbon County and 27 in Duchesne County. Most are named in the National Register listing only by their Smithsonian trinomial codes, but there were three named sites in Carbon County: Cottonwood Village, Drop-Dead Ruin, and First Canyon Site. The named ones in Duchesne County are Centennial House, Fool's Pinnacle, Karen's Cist, Maxies Pad, Nordell's Fort, Redman Village, Sunstone Village, and Taylor's City. The locations and details of these sites are not disclosed by the National Register. The 63 sites include 40 Fremont constructions, 19 rock art sites, and 4 sets of historical- era dwellings. A further 165 sites were added on September 12, 2012, all of them designated by codes only. Of these additional listings, 158 are in Carbon County and 7 in Duchesne County. On September 22, 2014, 101 more sites were added, all in Carbon County. History Archaic to modern, November 2007 There is some evidence that American fur trappers may have entered the canyon in the early 19th century, but the first unequivocal sign of a white presence is an inscription on the canyon wall reading \\"S. Groesbeck August 19, 1867\\". John Wesley Powell's second Colorado River expedition camped at the mouth of the canyon in 1871, and the earliest appearance of the name Nine Mile Canyon is in records of the expedition. Nine Mile Canyon Road (also 9 Mile Canyon Road) was constructed through the canyon in 1886 by the Buffalo Soldiers of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, linking Fort Duchesne to the railroad through the city of Price. Use of the road surged in 1889 after the discovery of Gilsonite in the Uinta Basin. This was the main transportation route in eastern Utah until well into the 20th century. Most of the stagecoach, mail, freight, and telegraph traffic into the Uinta Basin passed through Ninemile Canyon until after the arrival of the Uintah Railway around 1905. The freight trade led to the settlement of the canyon itself. One of the main stagecoach stops developed into a town of sorts. Called Harper, it included a hotel, store, school, and an unofficial post office. It lacked a formal town site, simply taking in a long stretch of scattered ranches and buildings. The community grew gradually from the 1880s until it was officially established as the town of Harper in 1905. The Harper precinct as a whole had a population of 130 at its peak in 1910, but in the early 1920s Harper became a ghost town. Current issues Defaced rock art in Rasmussen Cave, April 2007 Rock art and other ancient artifacts are now protected by law and, although enforcement is difficult, outright looting and malicious vandalism are largely a thing of the past. Ninemile Canyon's rock art, however, is still at risk. Carved and painted mainly on weathered sandstone panels, the images are susceptible to erosion, which is accelerated by touching and airborne dust. The dust is a special concern as heavy industrial traffic in the canyon increases. Nine Mile Canyon Road, once such an important route, was almost completely unpaved until 2013. In fact, it was considered the poorest of the four old military roads in Duchesne County. In 1990, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) designated it as a Scenic Backcountry Byway. The Ninemile Canyon Paving project is expected to be complete in October 2014 (weather permitting). Natural gas development Bill Barrett Corporation's natural gas compressor station, at the Dry Canyon junction, March 2008 Nine Mile's unique archaeological resources have led to intense debate over land use. As in many rural areas of the Western United States, land in the canyon is a patchwork of public and private property. Archaeological sites are found on both. Commercially important deposits of minerals and other geological resources have also been discovered, further complicating the issues. Since 2002, the Bill Barrett Corporation, in cooperation with the BLM and private landowners, has been pursuing a natural gas exploration project on the West Tavaputs Plateau in and around the canyon. The company estimates the available natural gas reserves at approximately 1 trillion cubic feet (2.8 m¬≥). Bill Barrett Corporation has spent some $2 million on improving area roads, and the complete project, if approved as planned, could create as many as 1000 jobs. Government involvement in the project has been controversial, drawing complaints from conservation groups that not enough is being done to protect natural and cultural resources. Road dust drifts up the canyon, March 2008. Dust-covered petroglyphs, March 2008 Previous to 2013, industrial truck traffic on Nine Mile's main road were producing clouds of dust. Prior to paving, the dirt road was not maintained for heavy traffic. The dust reduced visibility on the road and settled on the rock art. Carbon County, which supervises the use of the road, approved the application of magnesium chloride on the road as a dust abatement measure. The compound pulled moisture from the air to dampen dust, but it may have done more harm than good as the magnesium chloride dust may have drifted on to the rock walls.

When his captain said he would have to re-enlist a third, he left. He came to a town all hung in black and heard that ever since the king's daughter died, a phantom has smothered, every night, a soldier left on guard in the church.

The first night, he hid behind the altar, during the quarter-hour while the phantom walked; it spotted him just before midnight, and vanished when the clock struck. The second night, he hid in the pulpit; the phantom hunted for him for half an hour and had its feet on the stairs to the pulpit when midnight struck. He was too afraid to stay for a third, and went to flee. A woman spoke to him, knowing he was running away, and gave him a pair of scissors, telling him to pare the nails of the phantom's hands and feet. The third night, he did not hide, but as soon as the phantom arrived, it threw its arms about him, and he pared the nails. It turned into a beautiful princess. She told him that she had not been dead, but buried alive. The king let him marry her.

She was born in Columbus, Georgia, in 1959. In addition to writing, Youngblood has worked as a public information assistant for WPBA in Atlanta and as a Peace Corps volunteer in Dominica.  Early life and education  Many elements of Shay Youngblood's life are reflected in her fiction. Like many of her heroines, Youngblood herself was an orphan at an early age. Her mother died when she about two years old, and she was raised by a community family: grandfathers, uncles and many women with similarities to those described her books and plays. Youngblood was one of the first people in her family to attend college. While earning her bachelor's degree in mass communication at Clark-Atlanta University, she participated in a service project in Haiti. Her work in Haiti heightened her awareness of the injustice suffered by poor people in many places around the world. Immediately after graduating she joined the Peace Corps, and in 1981 she served as an agricultural information officer in Dominica, in the Eastern Caribbean. Later on, in 1993, Shay earned her MFA in Creative Writing form Brown University.  Works  Youngblood is recognized as a poet, playwright, fiction writer, and has also written, produced, and directed two short videos. She is best known for her three texts, The Big Mama Stories, Soul Kiss and her most recent novel, Black Girl in Paris. Youngblood states that her first published text, The Big Mama Stories, is the closest to autobiographical of all of her works. This compilation of short stories focuses on the coming of age of a poor, young African-American girl named Chile. Chile's biological mother, Fannie Mae, has died and so Chile and her brother go to live with a woman called \\"Big Mama,\\" who raises the children with the help of the entire community. Her fiction, articles and essays have been published in Oprah magazine, Good Housekeeping, BlackBook and Essence magazines, among many other publications. Her plays - Amazing Grace, Shakin' the Mess Outta Misery and Talking Bones - have been widely produced. Other plays by Youngblood include Black Power Barbie and Communism Killed My Dog.

If the athlete is fatigued or has not warmed up properly he/she may suffer a hamstring strain/rupture, which is the tearing of the hamstring muscle. Avulsion of the biceps femoris tendon, is the complete pulling away of the tendon from the bone. This most commonly occurs where the long head attaches to the ischial tuberosity. Injuries to biceps femoris are more common than to other hamstring muscles. One theory for this is the fact that each of the two heads are innervated by different branches of the sciatic nerve. In states of fatigue or when the muscle is not fully warmed up, uncoordinated firing of the nerves may cause the muscle to contract inappropriately during movement, leading to injury. Biceps femoris tendon avulsion may also be associated with an avulsion fracture which occurs when a piece of the bone is pulled away with the tendon, during forceful contraction. Isolated avulsion is rare.  Symptoms  *Avulsions normally occur during a rapid or violent movement involving hip flexion and knee extension and are known to be extremely painful *Swelling will appear in the region of the avulsion *an associated loss in hamstring strength (i.e. a decreased ability to flex the knee joint against resistance) *In some avulsion fractures, the bone fragment may be palpated through the skin The R.I.C.E. technique should be administered, however a sports injury specialist is recommended for the possibility of surgery.

It has been employed as a scorched earth tactic to deprive the advancing enemy of food and shelter, or to wreck the enemy's economy and infrastructure. It has also been used for purposes of counter- insurgency and ethnic cleansing. Systematic house demolition has been a notable factor in a number of recent or ongoing conflicts including the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, the Darfur conflict in Sudan, the Iraq War, the Vietnam War, the Yugoslav wars and the Caucasian conflicts of the 1990s. The tactic has often been extremely controversial. Its use in warfare is governed by the Fourth Geneva Convention and other instruments of international law, and international war crimes courts have prosecuted the misuse of house demolition on a number of occasions as a violation of the laws of war. Historically, it has also been widely used by a variety of states and peoples as a civil punishment for criminal offences ranging from treason to drunkenness. Uses=Military uses Wesel was destroyed before it was finally taken by Allied troops.RAF campaign diary March 1945 See the entry for 23/24 March 1945 Bombed buildings in London. A distinction needs to be made between the destruction of houses as an incidental effect of military necessity, the wanton destruction of houses during a military advance, and the deliberate targeting of houses during a military occupation. In the former case, it is commonplace for civilian homes to be used by armed forces as places of shelter or as firing positions. As a result, civilian dwellings become a legitimate military target and property damage is often inevitable as forces seek to expel their opponents from buildings. This can result in the destruction of houses on a massive scale as a side-effect of urban warfare. Following World War II, for instance, the United States occupation authorities in Germany found that 81 percent of all houses in the American Zone had been destroyed or damaged in the fighting.Jennifer Leaning, \\"War and the Environment\\", in Michael McCally, Life Support: Environment Human Health, p. 276. MIT Press, 2002. The question of under what circumstances the destruction of civilian dwellings becomes a legitimate military tactic remains controversial, and recent international conventions have agreed that civilian houses, dwellings, and installations shall not be made the object of attack, except if they are used mainly in support of the military effort.International Humanitarian Law - Treaties & Documents, International Committee of the Red Cross website However, there are also many non-combat situations in which house demolition has been used. It has served a variety of purposes, depending on the nature and context of the conflict. =Scorched earth= The ruins of Selinus, razed by Carthage around 250 BC As a strictly military tactic, house demolition is useful as a defensive means of denying supplies and shelter to an enemy or, when used as an offensive measure, to break an enemy's power by destroying his economy and dispersing his population. It has been used both defensively and offensively in numerous conflicts throughout history. In classical antiquity, there were frequent examples of cities being razed in order to destroy individual city-states. Notably, Xerxes I of Persia razed Athens in 480 BC during the Greco-Persian Wars; Carthage razed Selinus in modern Sicily around 250 BC; and in turn, Carthage was itself utterly destroyed by Rome in 146 BC, ending the Punic Wars. In many instances (Selinus and Carthage being cases in point) the city's inhabitants were enslaved and not permitted to return to their destroyed homes. In more recent times, the burning of homes was used to devastating effect in the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century, during which Louis XIV of France ordered the systematic destruction of the German cities of Bingen, Heidelberg, Mannheim, Oppenheim, Spier and Worms (while sparing the cathedrals). Germany had suffered even more extensively in the earlier Thirty Years' War, in which as much as two-thirds of German real estate is estimated to have been destroyed and reconstruction took as long as fifty years.\\"Depredations\\", Andr√© Corvisier, in A Dictionary of Military History and the Art of War, pp. 189‚Äì190 During the American Civil War, the burning of Atlanta, Georgia and Sherman's March to the Sea in 1864 provided large-scale examples of the use of house demolition as a means of wrecking the enemy's economy. In World War II, civilian homes were deliberately destroyed on a massive scale, particularly on the Eastern Front following the orders of Soviet premier Joseph Stalin to raze houses, farms and fields to deny their use to the advancing forces of Nazi Germany. Belarus was one of the worst affected regions, suffering the systematic destruction of about 75% of urban housing and many villages.Helen Fedor, Belarus and Moldova: Country Studies, p. 44. Library of Congress, 1995. Both sides also engaged in the deliberate large-scale targeting of civilian homes in their respective strategic bombing campaigns. The Germans repeatedly carried out indiscriminate bombing attacks against civilian areas, such as the bombing of Belgrade in 1941 and the Baedeker Blitz against England in 1942, and the Allies sought to demoralize the German workforce through the destruction of their homes‚Äîa policy known euphemistically as dehousing. Around 25% of Germany's housing stock was destroyed or heavily damaged in the subsequent Allied bombing campaigns, with some cities suffering the loss of up to 97% of civilian homes.Jeffry M. Diefendorf, In the Wake of War: The Reconstruction of German Cities After World War II, p. 126. Oxford University Press, 1993. =Ethnic cleansing= : A destroyed house in Croatia marked with Serbian nationalist symbols and graffiti In the former Yugoslavia, the tactic of home demolition was used by all sides in the conflict as a means of ethnic cleansing to change the ethnic composition of particular areas. It had particularly devastating effects in the rural areas of Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo where the tactic was most prevalent, because the building of new homes was a life project for which families worked for many years. A house often symbolized the social worth of a family, demonstrating its hard work, commitment to future well-being and standing in the community. The systematic burning of homes was therefore deliberately intended to impoverish the home owners, reduce their social status and permanently prevent them from returning to their places of origins.Marie-Janine Calic, in Farimah Daftary, Stefan Troebst, Radical Ethnic Movements in Contemporary Europe, p. 118. Berghahn Books, 2003. By the end of the Bosnian War in 1995, over 60% of the country's housing stock had been destroyed.Swanee Hunt, This Was Not Our War: Bosnian women reclaiming the peace, p. 158. Duke University Press, 2004. Similar tactics have been used in a variety of other ethnic conflicts. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, there were a number of major incidents of the deliberate destruction of Arab villages by Israeli forces. The Israeli historian Benny Morris writes that in the later stages of the 1948 war, \\"[Israeli] commanders were clearly bent on driving out the population in the area they were conquering\\".Morris, Benny (2003). The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The inhabitants of Iraqi Kurdistan experienced one of the more extreme recent examples of the mass use of home demolitions to expedite ethnic cleansing during the Al-Anfal Campaign of 1986‚Äì1989. The campaign was mounted ostensibly to eliminate the peshmerga rebels of northern Iraq but quickly acquired a genocidal character. The Kurdish opposition estimated that of the approximately 5,000 villages existing in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1975, 3,479 had been deliberately destroyed by 1988. Upwards of 100,000 Kurds were killed and tens of thousands more fled Iraq to escape the campaign. Saddam Hussein's government adopted a policy of \\"Arabization\\" in which it systematically replaced the displaced Kurds with Iraqi Arabs in strategic areas such as Kirkuk.Cited by Martin Bruinessen in \\"Genocide of the Kurds\\", in Israel W. Charny, Alan L. Berger, Genocide: a critical bibliographic review vol. 3, p. 186. Transaction Publishers, 1994. In the conflicts in Abkhazia, North Ossetia and South Ossetia during the early 1990s, scores of villages were destroyed in a systematic effort to expel the native Georgian and Ingush populations from those regions.Roberta Cohen, Francis Mading Deng, The Forsaken People: Case Studies of the Internally Displaced, pp. 245, 289. Brookings Institution Press, 1998. In Darfur, the Janjaweed militia has made house demolition a central part of its strategy to expel the population of the region, causing 2.5 million people to be displaced as of October 2006. =Counter-insurgency and collective punishment= Boer civilians watching British soldiers burn down their house Hut set ablaze in My Lai, Vietnam Governments facing insurgencies have often used home demolition as a counter-insurgency technique, as a means of eroding popular support for guerrillas and denying insurgents the use of villages as \\"safe havens\\". Mao Zedong, leader of the insurgent Communist Party of China during the Chinese Civil War, famously observed that \\"The guerrilla must move amongst the people as a fish swims in the sea.\\"Dana R. Dillon. Insurgency Has Its Limits. National Review online. November 25, 2003 Mao advocated the forced migration of large populations of civilians by means of house demolition to \\"drain the sea\\" and deprive insurgents of cover.Greenhill, Kelly. \\"Draining the Sea, or Feeding the Fire?: The Use of Forced Migration in Insurgency and Counter- Insurgency Operations Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, March 17, 2004 This principle was, however, widely recognized well before it was encapsulated in Mao's famous dictum. William the Conqueror's Harrying of the North in 1069‚Äì1070, during which his Norman troops systematically laid waste to the rebellious north of England, can be considered an early example of the use of house demolition to deprive an enemy of civilian support. Similarly, during the Second Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902, the British army under Lord Kitchener systematically destroyed Boer farms and homesteads in order to prevent Boer guerrillas from obtaining food and supplies, and to demoralize them by leaving their women and children homeless and starving in the open. Comparable tactics were used by the United States during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and again during the Vietnam War, when numerous villages were burned by US troops and local allies. General Colin Powell later recalled how he had personally participated in the destruction of Montagnard homes when he was serving in Vietnam as a young US Army officer: :\\"We burned down the thatched huts, starting the blaze with Ronson and Zippo lighters. Why were we torching houses and destroying crops? Ho Chi Minh had said the people were like the sea in which his guerrillas swam. ... We tried to solve the problem by making the whole sea uninhabitable. In the hard logic of war, what difference did it make if you shot your enemy or starved him to death?\\" Colin Powell, My American Journey, p. 87. Random House, 1995 The Soviet Union used home destruction tactics indiscriminately during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War when it sought to depopulate the countryside by attacking civilians in the villages in which they lived. Soviet troops would seize a settlement, expel the villagers and raze homes and other buildings before withdrawing. Sometimes the Soviets simply carpet-bombed villages to destroy them outright.Martin Ewans, Afghanistan: A New History, p. 161. Routledge, 2002. Similar depopulation tactics were adopted by Turkey in the 1980s and 1990s to combat the rebellion of the Marxist Kurdistan Workers Party in the Kurdish-populated parts of southeastern Turkey, known unofficially as Turkish Kurdistan.Robert W. Olson, The Kurdish Nationalist Movement in the 1990s: Its Impact on Turkey and the Middle East, p. 16. University Press of Kentucky, 1996. About 3,000 villages are estimated to have been destroyed during the Kurdish insurrection.Paul R. Pillar, Terrorism and U.S. Foreign Policy, p. 135. Brookings Institution Press, 2001. In a high-profile case brought before the European Court of Human Rights by a group of Kurdish villagers in 2002, the Turkish government was found guilty of violations of the right to private and family life and the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions. The court ordered the Turkish government to pay the applicants pecuniary damages for destruction of the houses and cost of alternative accommodations. It found that the several cases brought before it were but \\"a small sample of a much wider pattern\\" of house destruction employed by the Turkish government.\\"Villages from Kelek√ßi win international justice\\", Human Rights Watch Home demolition has also been used‚Äîsometimes in conjunction with mass killings‚Äîas a form of collective punishment to penalise civilians for guerrilla activities. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, this was a frequently used and highly controversial tactic employed by the German armed forces to counter the activities of guerrillas behind their front lines. It was used in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71 during the German occupation of France, when the Germans were faced with attacks by francs-tireurs, who were regarded explicitly as unlawful combatants. Mayors of occupied villages were ordered to report francs-tireurs operating in their districts or have their houses burned down. When francs-tireurs did attack, homes and entire villages were destroyed by the Germans in retaliation. Following the war, the Germans officially endorsed the use of house demolition as one of a number of forms of collective punishment in the Kriegs-Etappen-Ordnung, the manual for the rear echelons, even though this violated international law at the time.Isabel V. Hull, Absolute Destruction: Military Culture and the Practices of War in Imperial Germany, p. 119. Cornell University Press, 2006. The tactic was used to devastating effect by the Imperial German Army during the Herero and Namaqua Genocide in German South-West Africa, in which an estimated 75,000-100,000 Africans were killed. It was used again during World War I in a wave of systematic violence in occupied France and Belgium in August and September 1914, prompted in part by a fear of a civilian uprising and possible resistance by francs-tireurs. Some 6,000 people were killed and 15,000-20,000 buildings, including whole villages, were destroyed.Hull, p. 210 German forces made a much more systematic use of house demolition tactics during the World War II, razing numerous villages in occupied countries in reprisal for the killing of German troops by partisans. On occasions, the Germans massacred the inhabitants, as happened at Oradour-sur-Glane in France and Lidice in Czechoslovakia. The German reprisal policy was deliberately exploited by Soviet partisans, who would place killed Germans near neutral villages in order to trigger a reaction. The Soviets hoped that the resultant retaliatory killings and house demolitions would goad the villagers into actively supporting the partisans.Roger Dale Petersen, Resistance and Rebellion: Lessons from Eastern Europe, p. 229. Cambridge University Press, 2001. A Palestinian home after demolition by Israeli security forces The use of punitive house demolitions has been highly controversial in the various conflicts of historical Palestine (now Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip). The tactic had originally been used by the British in the Irish War for Independence,http://www.balbriggan.net/blackandtans.htm March 1921 and exported to the British Mandate of Palestine in 1945. It was used as a means to \\"convince fathers to convince their sons that carrying out a terrorist attack, no matter how justified in the grander struggle, meant enormous hardship for the family.\\", page 160 Its use was continued by the Israeli government on-again-off-again fashion during the al-Aqsa Intifada of the early 21st century, during which more than 3,000 civilian homes have been demolished. Through No Fault of Their Own: Israel's Punitive House Demolitions in the al-Aqsa Intifada B'Tselem Notably, the family homes of a number of Palestinian bombers were targeted in retaliation for terrorist attacks against Israeli targets. However, the usefulness of such tactics has been questioned; in 2005 an Israeli Army commission to study house demolitions found no proof of effective deterrence and concluded that the damage caused by the demolitions outweighed their effectiveness. As a result, the Israel Defense Forces approved the commission's recommendations to end punitive demolitions of Palestinian houses.Ingela Karlsson, \\"Is the House Demolition Policy Legal under International Humanitarian Law? \\". Diakonia, 16 November 2006. Retrieved 17-6-2007. (See House demolition in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict for more on this topic.) Civil uses House demolition has been practiced in many states throughout history as a form of punishment for a variety of legal offences. This should be distinguished from purely administrative demolitions, such as in the context of removing illegally constructed homes and other buildings. During the medieval period, the inhabitants of Flanders and northern France, particularly Picardy, faced the destruction of their homes for a variety of offences. For instance, the demolition of one's house was prescribed for those convicted of harbouring an outlaw.Carl Ludwing von Bar, A History of Continental Criminal Law, p. 193. The Lawbook Exchange Ltd., 1999. The practice also spread to the Cinque Ports of England, where a burgess who refused to perform his civic duties could find himself liable to have his house destroyed.John Horace Round, Feudal England: Historical Studies on the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries. S. Sonnenschein, 1895 Elsewhere in Europe, violence against the person was often punished by retaliation against the offender's property. Those convicted of murder in 18th century Montenegro were subject to a rapidly escalating range of penalties; the first offence was merely punished with a fine, but a third offence was punished by the culprit being shot, his home demolished and all of his cattle and property confiscated.Edward Dodwell, A Classical and Topographical Tour Through Greece, During the Years 1801, 1805, and 1806, p. 20. Rodwell & Martin, 1819 Home demolition was often employed by the state as a means of punishing crimes regarded as exceptionally dishonourable. In a number of medieval European countries, the relatives of those convicted of offences such as incest, sodomy, parricide or treason were sometimes collectively punished by having their homes demolished and their possessions confiscated.Florike Egmond, Robert Zwijnenberg, Bodily Extremities: Preoccupations with the Human Body in Early Modern European Culture, p. 106. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003. Patricide was similarly treated as an offence of exceptional seriousness in Qing Dynasty China; the offender would be executed, his house razed and the earth beneath it dug up.Peter Thompson, Robert Macklin, The Man Who Died Twice: The Life and Adventures of Morrison of Peking, p. 90. Allen & Unwin, 2004. In 18th century Korea, anyone convicted of committing treason or other major offences against the king was punished with the utmost severity; he would be executed along with his entire family, their home would be destroyed and all the contents and possessions confiscated, and nobody else would be permitted to build on the site of the razed house.Vibeke Roeper, Boudewijn Walraven, Jean-Paul Buys, Hendrik Hamel, Hamel's World: A Dutch-Korean Encounter in the Seventeenth Century, p. 138. Uitgeverij Boom, 2003. The use of house demolition was also prescribed in a number of states for offences against the social order. In the Pre-Columbian Aztec Empire, drunkenness was punished by publicly cutting off the offender's hair and demolishing his house.Edward John Payne, History of the New World Called America, p. 533. Clarendon Press, 1899 The illegal sale of alcohol was punished in a similar way in early 20th century Yemen, where a person convicted of selling alcohol to a Muslim would be liable to be bound and tortured and have his home destroyed.Tudor Parfitt, The Road to Redemption: the Jews of the Yemen, 1900-1950, p. 114. Brill Academic Publishers, 1996. Religious offences were punished similarly by the Inquisition; the Treaty of Meaux of 1229, directed against the Albigensians of southern France, provided that \\"when it is proved before the bishops that any one has died a heretic, his goods shall be destroyed and his house razed.\\"Adam Blair, History of the Waldenses: With an Introductory Sketch of the History of the Christian Churches, p. 364. A. Black, 1832 The Ordinamenti della Guistizia (Ordinances of Justice) of the medieval Italian city-state of Florence mandated a range of harsh penalties against nobles who killed or ordered the killing of citizens; the punishments included execution, the forfeiting of property and the razing of the offender's house.Edgcumbe Staley, Guilds of Florence, p. 50. Ayer Publishing, 1972. The ordinances were passed against the background of political and social conflict between powerful aristocrats and the ordinary citizens or popolares, and may have been a conscious imitation of the punishments meted out to overmighty aristocrats in the Roman Republic 1,300 years previously, when those suspected of aiming at tyranny risked not only execution but the destruction of their homes as well. This act was seen as a symbolic destruction of the offender's family and social status. To the Romans, the home was more than just a possession; it was a sacred space protected by the Di Penates (household gods) and was a focus for personal honour. Cicero suffered the loss and destruction of his homes at the hands of Publius Clodius Pulcher in 58 BC, and later spoke in his speech De Domo Sua (\\"About His House\\") of the \\"dishonour\\" and \\"grief\\" that he experienced as a result.Richard P. Saller, Patriarchy, Property and Death in the Roman Family, p. 93. Cambridge University Press, 1994. Means IDF Caterpillar D9R armored bulldozer in service with the Israeli Defense Forces Combat Engineering Corps The demolition of a house for military purposes is often undertaken in very different ways to conventional civilian demolitions. In peacetime situations, demolition is merely the first stage in a process that is usually intended to clear the ground for subsequent re-use (for instance, replacing an old building with a newer one or decommissioning an old industrial building). It is undertaken with extensive preparations, such as stripping the property of items of value, removing hazardous materials such as glass and asbestos insulation, and preparing the structure by removing features that might impede the demolition (such as internal partitions). Military house demolitions are undertaken with the demolition itself being the primary objective, the aim being to deliberately deny subsequent use of the property. The methods used are therefore focused on simplicity and speed. Unlike civilian demolition, military house demolition is also often intended to destroy property within a building, such as food or personal effects, either to deny its use to an enemy or to impoverish the civilian occupants. House demolitions thus often takes place without the occupant's possessions first being removed and with minimal preparations beforehand. In many conflicts, demolition frequently is carried out by using fire‚Äîoften set with the aid of accelerants‚Äîas a simple but very effective means of quickly rendering a property uninhabitable. Armored bulldozers or tanks may be used to knock out the walls of a building, causing it to collapse. Combat engineering forces may use explosives to demolish a building, or it may simply be destroyed through direct bombardment by aircraft or artillery. The end result is not always the total demolition of a building‚Äîthe walls may remain standing in the event of a fire, for instance‚Äîbut it does achieve the main objective of making the building unfit for habitation. However, when the Israeli military demolishes a house using armored bulldozers, it totally flattens the structure to eliminate possible hideouts for snipers and booby traps. Legal issues The Lieber Code, promulgated in 1863 by President Abraham Lincoln, was one of the first declarations specifically prohibiting the wanton destruction of a district in wartime. Article 23(g) of the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare similarly prohibited military forces \\"to destroy or seize the enemy's property, unless such destruction or seizure be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war\\", and Article 28 of the same convention stated that \\"the pillage of a town or place, even when taken by assault, is prohibited.\\" The massive destruction of civilian property inflicted during Second World War II prompted international jurists to address the issue again in 1945 when the Nuremberg Charter was enacted, establishing the procedures and laws by which the Nuremberg trials were to be conducted. Article 6(b) of the Charter thus condemned the \\"wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity\\" and classified it as a violation of the laws or customs of war. The same definition was replicated in the founding charters of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Court.Karen Hulme, War Torn Environment: Interpreting the Legal Threshold, p. 128. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2004. The use of house demolition under international law is today governed by the Fourth Geneva Convention, enacted in 1949, which protects non-combatants in occupied territories. Article 53 provides that \\"Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons ... is prohibited.\\"Fourth Geneva Convention, International Committee of the Red Cross In its accompanying commentaries, the International Committee of the Red Cross refers to demolition only being justified by \\"imperative military requirements\\", which the Convention itself distinguishes from security considerations. The ICRC has clarified that the term \\"military operations\\" refers only to \\"movements, maneuvers, and other action taken by the armed forces with a view to fighting\\" and does not cover action undertaken as a punishment. In a further reservation, the ICRC regards the tactic as legitimate only \\"where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations\\". The use of collective punishments is forbidden by the Hague Conventions, as well as by Article 50 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which expressly prohibits the imposition of punishments on a protected person for an offense that he or she has not personally committed.David Kretzmer, The Occupation of Justice: The Supreme Court of Israel and the Occupied Territories, p. 148. SUNY Press, 2002. Israeli use of house demolitions has been particularly controversial. However, Israel, which is a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention, asserts that the terms of the Convention are not applicable to the Palestinian territories on the grounds that it does not exercise sovereignty in the territories and is thus under no obligation to apply the treaty in those areas. This position is rejected by human rights organisations such as Amnesty International, which notes that \\"it is a basic principle of human rights law that international human rights treaties are applicable in all areas in which states parties exercise effective control, regardless of whether or not they exercise sovereignty in that area.\\"Israel and the Occupied Territories Under the rubble: House demolition and destruction of land and property . Amnesty International, 18 May 2004. A number of war crimes prosecutions have included charges relating to the illegal destruction of property. A number of those prosecuted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia have been prosecuted for ordering \\"wanton destruction\\", and the International Criminal Court has also indicted at least one individual for similar offences in Darfur.\\"Warrants of Arrest for the Minister of State for Humanitarian Affairs of Sudan, and a leader of the Militia/Janjaweed \\", International Criminal Court, 2 May 2007. International law nonetheless still permits a fairly wide degree of latitude for military commanders to destroy civilian property when required to do so by military necessity. In U.S. v. Von Leeb, one of the Nuremberg trials held in 1948, Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb and six other senior German generals were accused of the wanton devastation of Soviet villages during a German retreat on the Eastern Front. The acts of destruction were carried out in anticipation of the enemy advancing through the devastated zones in the imminent future and were conducted in mid-winter, when the lack of shelter could reasonably be expected to impede the Russians' progress. The civilian population had been evacuated beforehand. The tribunal found von Leeb and his co-defendants not guilty on the charge of devastation, taking the view that \\"a great deal of latitude must be accorded\\" to a commander in a tactical situation such as the one that von Leeb found himself in.Florentino Panlilio Feliciano, Myres Smith McDougal, The International Law of War: Transnational Coercion and World Public Order, p. 602.

The company operated under different names from 1874 to 1973. The company was founded in 1874 by Joseph Bosch (b. 11 February 1850), the son of a beer brewer. Bosch spent several years traveling, to Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Louisville to learn the art of brewing. He worked for some time at the Schlitz Brewing Company. Bosch Brewery west of Houghton on Portage Lake. Sandstone badge found on the side of the Bosch brewery building in Lake Linden, Michigan Torch Lake Brewery Joseph Bosch built the Torch Lake Brewery in 1874, a small wooden building.James Fisher, Houghton Centennial Souvenir History and Program, 1961. The small brewery thrived on thirsty miners working in Red Jacket, which is now Calumet. In its first year, the Torch Lake Brewing Company produced 1717 barrels.Clarence J. Monette, Joseph Bosch and the Bosch Brewing Co., 20 Sept. 1978. Bosch began building close ties with the local community; he would sell leftover malt to farmers and invite them into the brewery for a cold beer while they waited. Bosch's products were popular among the thirsty miners. The Keweenaw was booming with copper mining, attracting new people to the area, and Bosch's business grew with the increased population. In 1876 Bosch formed a partnership with Joseph Wertin Sr., Joseph Wertin Jr., and George Wertin. It was at this time that the company name was changed from the Torch Lake Brewing Company to Joseph Bosch and Company. When the company first started it sold only kegs, as beer in bottles was uncommon at the time.Dan Crane, The Brewing Industry A Copper Country Close-Up, 1986. After the discovery of pasteurization, breweries began bottling beer by the late 1870s.Old Bottles and Jugs of Michigan's Copper Country, Lake Linden, Mich.: John H. Forester Press, 1992. Bosch began bottling on a small scale by 1880, one of the few Upper Peninsula breweries to bottle beer. By 1883 the company was producing 4000 barrels of beer annually, one quarter of it bottled. In 1886, the plant continued to expand, and a artesian well was drilled to provide pure water for brewing. On May 20, 1887, a fire swept through the town of Lake Linden, destroying 75% of the town, including the newly expanded brewery. Fortunately, Bosch was compensated by insurance, and by September 7, the brewery was rebuilt and running again. The company continued to grow, and in 1889, The Bosch Brewery stood 11th out of 102 breweries in the state of Michigan. By 1892 the company had branches in Hancock, Calumet, Ishpeming, Eagle Harbor, and Baraga. One place that Bosch was missing, and greatly desired, was Houghton, which he viewed as the ideal location for a brewery. Bosch Brewing Company In 1894, when Joseph Wertin Sr. died, Bosch bought out his remaining partners and changed the company name a final time to the Bosch Brewing Company. Bosch bought the Union Brewery in 1899, including the Scheuermann brewing plant located on Portage Lake in Houghton, a location he had long wanted. The plant became known as the Scheuermann branch of the Bosch Brewing Company.Roger Komula, Beer was dear to region, Houghton Daily Mining Gazette, 26 Mar. 1994. In 1903 the company had an annual production capacity of 60,000 barrels. The newly organized Bosch Brewing Company continued its growth, becoming the second largest industry in the Copper Country, second only to mining. Joseph Bosch maintained a close relationship with the community, using local themes in his advertising such as the tagline \\"Refreshing as a sportsman‚Äôs paradise\\". The brewery welcomed public tours and had a bar where customers could sample fresh beer. It was also rumored that students from the local university, now Michigan Technological University, would canoe down the Portage and buy beer straight from the Bosch docks.Erik Nordberg, From the Archives: The Bosch Brewing Company, Michigan Tech Magazine, Fall 2006, vol. 43, n.2. Prohibition Hard times threatened with talk of prohibition. Bosch placed ads in local papers headlined \\"Prohibition vs. Temperance\\", trying to sway people away from prohibition.Calumet and Hecla Mining Co., Semi-Centennial, 1916. In 1919 the Volstead Act allowed the Federal Government to enforce the 18th amendment, beginning prohibition. Bosch had no choice but to close his company and pray for a miracle. Back to brewing The reprieve came in 1933 when the 21st amendment repealed prohibition, and Bosch was able to return to brewing, although only the Scheuermann plant reopened. In 1937, Joseph Bosch died aged 87.J. Michael Gwidt, Mining Beer, History of Breweries in Michigan‚Äôs Copper Country, spring 2000. His daughter, Katherine Bosch, and grandsons James and Phillip Ruppe took over the company. Under their leadership, the company saw continuous growth and increasing sales. After reopening, Bosch continued to prosper. In 1955, sales were over the 100,000 barrel mark. The good relationship between company and community maintained local brand loyalty. One advertising theme was \\"Refreshing as the Sportsman's Paradise\\", and the beer labels announced \\"From the Sportsman‚Äôs Paradise...Smooth, Mellow, Golden,\\" with a picture of a fisherman reeling in a fish with pine trees in the background. An advertisement titled \\"It‚Äôs the FLAVOR that wins you!\\" had a picture of a skier zooming down a hill, and \\"Bosch ‚Äì The Gold Medal Beer\\" below. With ads such as these, Bosch tied itself to local pride in the outdoor activities and natural beauty of the area. The Bosch Brewing Co. was also the third-largest employer in the area.Brewers Digest, Feb. 1966. The Bosch Brewing Company reached its peak in 1955, producing one hundred thousand barrels.Michigan Tech Lode, 3 Oct. 1973, pg.9. Five years later, however, Bosch's sales began to decline. By 1965, the Bosch family sold the company to local investors led by Charles Finger, who pushed for new technology and products to resurrect the company. An example of Bosch advertising, painted on the side of a tavern in Wisconsin. Brewer's Digest commented in 1966: \\"Certainly the Bosch Brewing Co. has all of the ingredients for success that a smaller brewery can have ‚Äì an efficient, well equipped plant; dedicated employees who know their jobs thoroughly and who take personal pride in the products the company markets; an intimate and realistic knowledge of the market it serves and of the consumers' desires. But most of all it has an enthusiastic management, the kind of enthusiasm that can become contagious among potential customers.\\" In 1968, Bosch introduced a Sauna Beer, developed after consultation with brewers in Finland. According to The Houghton Daily Mining Gazette: \\"This beer is for those who prefer a light bodied, mildly flavorful, bitter-free beer, light lunches, and long evenings.\\" It was a light beer similar to Finnish \\"kalja\\", and was called a perfect after-sauna thirst quencher. Since many local residents had Finnish ancestry, and so were familiar with saunas, Sauna Beer sold well, and won Houghton County‚Äôs Product of the Year Contest in 1968.Sauna Beer picked county product of year, Houghton Daily Mining Gazette, 10 Apr. 1968. By the late 1960s, Bosch was making three beers, all light lagers: Sauna Beer, the flagship label Bosch, and premium Gilt Edge. The death of a brewery In the early 1970s Bosch was unable to compete with the large breweries of Detroit, Milwaukee, and St. Louis. On September 28, 1973, the last keg of Bosch beer was delivered to Schmidt's Corner Bar in Houghton. The strong connection between Bosch and the community was even more apparent on that day. The Daily Mining Gazette captured the atmosphere at the bar stating \\"there were so many the patrons were crawling on one another\\", while locals expressed their dismay: \\"the Copper Country is losing many of these small industries... we just can't stand to lose such industries, that's all that's to it.\\"Houghton Daily Mining Gazette, Green Sheet, 6 Oct. 1973 The trademarks were sold to the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Leinenkugel continued to produce the signature Bosch brand in the traditional flavor, and hired Bosch master brewer Vincent Charney. Brand loyalists continued drinking Bosch, but after several years, profit from the Bosch brand diminished and Leinenkugel suspended production of Bosch in 1986. Bringing back Bosch The popularity of microbreweries is growing rapidly, and the few microbreweries in the area seem to be doing well, including the Keweenaw Brewing Company, the Library Restaurant and Pub in Houghton, and the Michigan House Caf√© and Brew Pub in Calumet, home of Red Jacket Brewing. The number of small specialty brewers in the U.S. has risen dramatically in recent decades. In 1997 the United States for the first time surpassed Germany in the number of breweries, despite Germany having the highest per capita consumption of beer. From 1983 to mid-1999, the number of brewing firms in the United States increased from 43 to 1414, and the number continues to increase. Nearly every brewery opened in the past 20 years has been associated with the microbrewery movement.Carroll, Glenn R., and Anand Swaminathan. \\"Why the Microbrewery Movement? Organizational Dynamics of Resource Partitioning in the U.S. Brewing Industry.\\" 715-162. 06 Apr. 2007 By definition, a microbrewery is \\"a brewery producing less than 15,000 barrels per year\\".Microbrewery. 2007. Lexico Publishing Group. 06 Apr 2007. In 1994, Leinenkugel manager Chuck Strehl said: \\"Microbreweries have become economically feasible in past years and some smaller breweries have been able to get at new lease on life.\\" He said \\"The Bosch label could probably be produced today and even make a profit.\\" See also * Joseph Bosch Building * Bosch Brewery, an unrelated German Company (on German Wikipedia). * List of defunct breweries in the United States References Further reading  Michigan Tech Lode, April 24, 1969.

History Follett Corporation was founded in 1873 when Charles M. Barnes opened a used book store in his Wheaton, Illinois home. Three years later, Barnes moved his business, now named C. M. Barnes & Company, to Chicago where he opened a store at 23 LaSalle Street. Here, he sold new and used textbooks, stationery and school supplies. Charles Wolcott Follett (1883‚Äì1952) joined the company in 1901 as a stock clerk. The following year, Charles Barnes retired and his son, William, became president. The company had now evolved into a wholesaler, selling used books throughout the Midwest and as far away as the Oklahoma Territory. In 1908, the company was reorganized as C. M. Barnes‚ÄìWilcox Company when John Wilcox, William Barnes' father-in-law, became the company's primary shareholder. Four years later, in 1912, C. W. Follett became vice president and a shareholder of the company. In 1917, William Barnes sold his remaining interest in the company to John Wilcox. Later that year, Barnes moved to New York where he partnered with G. Clifford Noble and founded Barnes & Noble. The following year, with Wilcox nearing retirement, C. W. Follett took over management of the company and it was once again renamed, this time as J. W. Wilcox & Follett Company. John Wilcox died in 1923 and the following year, C. W. Follett and his wife, Edythe, purchased the company. During the next two years, C. W. Follett's three oldest sons‚ÄîRobert Duncan (Bob), Garth and Dwight‚Äîjoined the family business. C. W.'s youngest son, Laddie, who was still in grade school, joined the company in 1930. In 1925, Dwight founded the Follett Publishing Company. In 1930, R. D. Follett founded the Follett College Book Company and began wholesaling used textbooks to professors and college bookstores. The following year, R. D. established the company's first retail bookstore on a college campus outside of Chicago, and in 1940, Garth Follett created Follett Library Book Company. Laddie Follett ran the company's original business ‚Äì Wilcox & Follett ‚Äì from 1952 until 1986. When C. W. Follett died in 1952 at the age of 70, Dwight Follett succeeded his father as chairman. The company continued to grow and was renamed Follett Corporation in 1957, which it is still known by today. In the mid-1970s, Dwight began to prepare for his retirement and Dick Litzsinger, R. D. Follett's son-in-law, was elected president and chief executive officer. In 1979, Dwight retired and Robert J. R. Follett was named chairman. Follett Publishing sold its trade publications in 1979 to New Century Publishing; the remainder of Follett Publishing was sold to Esquire Inc. In 1994, Robert J. R. Follett retired and Dick Traut, R. D.'s son-in-law, was elected chairman. The following year, Loyola University Chicago named Follett Illinois Family Business of the Year. Dick Litzsinger retired as president and chief executive officer in 1997, and Ken Hull was elected president. Ken was the first non-family member to be elected president of the corporation. In 1997, Follett also restructured its board of directors, adding three non-family members. That same year, it joined Internet Systems in forming Library Systems & Services, a joint venture that provides library management services to public, academic and corporate libraries across the country. In addition, Follett purchased Book Wholesalers (BWI) ‚Äì a distributor of children's books to public libraries. In 1998, to strengthen the company's ability to meet the needs of its customers, Follett aligned its various business units under three market groups ‚Äì Higher Education, Elementary and High Schools and Libraries. Dick Traut retired as chairman in 1999, and Ken Hull became chairman and chief executive officer of the corporation. In addition, in 1999, Follett launched the www.efollett.com web site. In 2000, Christopher Traut was elected president and chief executive officer of Follett Corporation. Ken Hull remained as chairman of Follett Corporation. In addition, Follett's three core market groups were combined to form Follett Higher Education Group and Follett Library and School Group. In April 2001, Ken Hull retired and Mark Litzsinger was elected chairman of Follett Corporation. Following a rigorous analysis of the company's portfolio of business units, Follett merged Follett Media Distribution, which provided audio visual products to school and public libraries, into BWI in an effort to provide its library customers with one-stop shopping for all of their book and media needs. In addition, in June 2003, Follett sold its interest in Library Systems & Services (LSSI). In 2010, Chris Traut retired. Charles R. (Chuck) Follett took over the company as president and CEO after holding a wide range of leadership roles during his 37 years with the company. That same year, Follett was ranked #155 in Forbes‚Äô list of largest private companies. In 2011, the Follett School and Library Group was created to serve the K‚Äì12 market under one business group. Strategic business decisions were made to move the focus of the school and library group into the K‚Äì12 classroom, and in 2011, certain assets of Follett's public library business, BWI, were sold. In April 2011, Alison O‚ÄôHara was named chairman of the board. Prior to becoming chairman, she served as assistant general counsel of Follett and was a member of the company's board of directors for 11 years. Under O‚ÄôHara's direction, the board underwent another transformation by bringing in outside directors to lead Follett into the digital future. O'Hara died unexpectedly on July 20, 2013, from complications of breast cancer.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-04/news/ct-met-barasa- obit-20130804_1_breast-cancer-follett-corp-family-business In November 2012, Mary Lee Schneider was elected Follett's new president and CEO. Schneider is an 11-year veteran on the Follett Board of Directors. Schneider came to Follett from Chicago-based RR Donnelley, where she recently was president, and Digital Solutions and Chief Technology Officer. In January 2014, Follett Corporation announced that the company's board of directors named Todd Litzsinger as chairman of the board. Litzsinger succeeds Steve Waichler, who held the role on an interim basis following the passing of O'Hara in 2013. Litzsinger joined Follett in 1992, and has served on the board since 2003. He has held a series of leadership positions with the company, most recently President of Content Solutions and Services for Follett School Solutions, the company's preK‚Äì12 business. In March 2014, approximately 750 employees from the company's corporate office and its Chicago-area suburban operations in Oak Brook, Westmont, and River Grove relocated to Three Westbrook Corporate Center, a 160,000 square-foot tower in Westchester. On April 1, 2014, Follett's PreK‚Äì12 businesses became one legal entity named Follett School Solutions, Inc. This allowed the company to leverage the content and technology capabilities of its previously separate businesses: Follett Educational Services, Follett Library Resources and Follett Software Company. In the 2010s, the company is focusing on e-commerce, and digital offerings and text rental, in addition to its core areas of expertise. Today, Follett is a $2.7 billion, privately held company that serves more than five million students at its more than 1,600 physical and online stores. It employs approximately 15,000 associates throughout the United States, Canada and other parts of the world. In May 2015, Follett Corporation appointed Ray A. Griffith as president and CEO.

Minarik III (January 2, 1960, in Rochester, New York ‚Äì April 12, 2009 in Webster, New York) was a New York State political figure who served as the chairman of the Monroe County, New York, and New York State Republican Committees. Life Minarik was the son of Stephen J., Jr. and Eleanor Minarik. He graduated from Irondequoit High School in 1978 and received a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Rochester in 1982. He credited working in his grandfather's restaurant, Steve's Treetop Inn, as key to his future political career. He began his career in politics in 1979 with Young Americans For Freedom the nation's largest young conservative organization. He became active in government in 1983, when he was hired to be the assistant deputy county clerk in the office of the Monroe County Legislature's Republican majority. He worked on Republican campaigns, most notably those of Congressman Fred J. Eckert and County Executive Lucien Morin. In 1988, he moved to a position in the county's community development administration and formed a campaign committee in 1989 to elect Republicans to the County Legislature. In 1990, the GOP hired him to be the executive director of its county committee which led to his election to chairman in 1992, a post he held for sixteen years. During this time, he led the Republican Party to a takeover of the County Legislature and elected three consecutive Republican county executives: Robert L. King, Jack Doyle, and Maggie Brooks. Said Ben Smith of the New York Observer, \\"his record in Rochester is, in political terms, difficult to argue with: With only a slight Republican registration advantage, and working both as a paid political consultant and as county chairman, he took nearly all of the county‚Äôs important offices away from the ruling Democrats and built a formidable organization\\". His successes as county chairman led Governor George E. Pataki to select him to be the Republican state chairman in November 2004. Minarik quickly came under attack following his remarks on the election of Howard Dean as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, stating that the Democrats were now the party of Barbara Boxer, Lynne Stewart, and Howard Dean. These comments set off a national firestorm, with Pataki publicly rebuking Minarik, and Dean demanding an apology or Minarik's resignation. Minarik refused, calling this \\"just the latest Dean Scream, and stating that the Democrats would be wise to take action on members like Lynne Stewart, rather than attacking me. Maybe then the Democratic Party can start to regain some credibility with the American people. Minarik also earned the ire of State Senator Serphin Maltese for leading a successful push to revamp the state committee's bylaws, and to include the Log Cabin Republicans on the State GOP's executive committee. Stated Minarik, in the Republican Party we are allowed to have diversity of opinion. While I may agree with Serph Maltese on many of the issues, particularly with regard to the Log Cabin Republican group, that doesn't mean they shouldn't be allowed to sit at our table and be part of our party. Inclusion won, and inclusion won handily. I'm happy about that. Minarik was a vocal booster of former Massachusetts Governor William F. Weld's candidacy for governor, and unsuccessfully pushed for the party to run moderate Republican candidates for governor and United States Senate. In June 2006, the State Republican Committee proceeded to nominate a conservative slate of candidates not favored by Minarik, including Gubernatorial nominee John Faso. Minarik prevailed on Weld to drop out of the Gubernatorial election to unify the party behind Faso. Faso faced questions during the campaign regarding his conservatism, his pro-life position and his lobbying activities. The Faso-led ticket lost all statewide offices to the Democrats for the first time in 60 years, and lost three Congressional seats. This included losses to Governor Eliot L. Spitzer and State Comptroller Alan Hevesi; both of whom would later resign their offices in disgrace. Minarik stepped down as chairman shortly after the 2006 elections. In 2008, he stepped down as chairman of the Monroe County Republican Committee at the request of Maggie Brooks. Minarik was a stroke survivor who reported developing a preference for country music after the incident. He lived resided in Webster, New York, and was a partner in a political consulting firm, Impact Communications, LLC. Death Minarik died on April 12, 2009, of a heart attack, aged 49. In an editorial mourning his death, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle stated that, > Wherever you stood on his political style and methods ‚Äì and this page was a > frequent critic over the years ‚Äì former Monroe County Republican chairman > Steve Minarik, who died Sunday, was an accomplished political leader in this > community...People stayed on message, and Republican control of the county > executive's office, the county Legislature and most town and village > governments testified to his success over his 16-year tenure as county chair > and two years as state chair.

It is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, with a DEA ACSCN of 9815. Œ±-Methylacetylfentanyl was sold briefly on the black market in the early 1980s, before the introduction of the Federal Analog Act which for the first time attempted to control entire families of drugs based on their structural similarity rather than scheduling each drug individually as they appeared. Œ±-Methylacetylfentanyl is made with the same synthetic route as Œ±-methylfentanyl, but by substituting the relatively common acetic anhydride for the more difficult to obtain chemical propionic anhydride in the synthesis. Œ±-Methylacetylfentanyl has similar effects to fentanyl. Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.

Delaware, 552 U.S. 597 (2008), is a United States Supreme Court case in which New Jersey sued Delaware, invoking the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction under (a), following Delaware's denial of oil company BP's petition to build a liquefied natural gas pipeline and loading facility on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River. Delaware denied BP's petition because it violated Delaware's Coastal Zone Act. BP then sought New Jersey's approval of the project. Delaware objected because the construction would require dredging of underwater land within Delaware's borders, which extend to the low-tide mark of the New Jersey shore. BP's proposal had not yet passed New Jersey's approval process when New Jersey and BP filed suit against Delaware. Jurisdiction over rivers that form a border between states is usually determined by dividing the river down the middle between the states; this is not the case with the Delaware River. Delaware-New Jersey's curious border is the result of a grant by King Charles II in 1681, when the Delaware Colony was leased by William Penn from King Charles to become the three lower counties of Pennsylvania. The grant extended Delaware's northern border by The Twelve-Mile Circle in New Castle, Delaware, extending across the Delaware River. If the circle were to be extended fully, it would have included a portion of New Jersey, but this was unacceptable because that land had already been granted. As a result, the 12-Mile-Circle terminated at the mean low water mark on New Jersey's shore. The post-1681 border gave present-day Delaware full ownership of the Delaware River along a stretch of the New Jersey border. The case adjudicated by the Supreme Court is the third incarnation of this litigation. The dispute over the border reaches back to the nation's creation. A settlement was reached between the States at the beginning of the 20th century because the costs of litigation had grown too high. The issue remained settled until New Jersey sued Delaware regarding the BP pipeline.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court appointed a special master to review. The Special Master was a practitioner in Maine who had experience in original jurisdiction land disputes. He oversaw production and heard oral arguments in the Third Circuit's court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Special Master made a recommendation to the Supreme Court, and the Court held, in a 6-2 decision, that Delaware has jurisdiction over the subaqueous soil, even though BP proposed to build on New Jersey's half of the Delaware River. The only two dissenting Justices (Scalia and Alito) are both from New Jersey. Scalia wrote in his opinion, \\"The New Jersey-Delaware Compact of 1905 (Compact or 1905 Compact), Art. VII, 34 Stat. 860, addressed the ‚Äúexercise [of] riparian jurisdiction,‚Äù and the power to ‚Äúmake grants ‚Ä¶ of riparian ‚Ä¶ rights.‚Äù The particular riparian right at issue here is the right of wharfing out. All are agreed that jurisdiction and power over that right were given to New Jersey on its side of the Delaware River.\\" Justice Stephen Breyer recused himself from the case; according to his financial disclosure form, he owned between $15,001 and $50,000 in BP stock.

He also has worked on films My Big Fat Greek Wedding, That Thing You Do! and Ricki and the Flash. Early musical career In his younger years, after time playing other instruments he changed to guitar on the advice of his older cousin Howard Leese, who has played with Heart. By the age of 17 he was a formative member in the band Hero who were eventually signed to 20th Century Records, releasing two albums, Hero and Boys Will Be Boys. Eventually the band would evolve into Head Shaker, which was fronted by David Donato whose later credits would include Black Sabbath and the Geezer Butler Band. With Lana Lane, Grammy Award and Quiet Riot By 1995 he had joined the band of symphonic and progressive rock singer Lana Lane and played on many of her albums, including the debut 1995 album Love Is An Illusion and Curious Goods, released the following year, which both enjoyed success in Japan. Touring would follow, resulting in the release of live material and several follow-up albums and the DVD Storybook: Tales from Europe and Japan, in which he is featured in both live performances and interviews. By 2002 he became more involved in solo projects as well as extensive studio work with artists such as Steve Vai, Steve Lukather and Larry Carlton. That year he received a Grammy Award in the Best Pop Instrumental Album category for engineering No Substitutions: Live in Osaka by Larry Carlton and Steve Lukather. His contribution to Lana Lane's albums would largely be guest spots in the studio from that point on. In 2006 he joined Quiet Riot and played guitar on, recorded, mixed and mastered the album Rehab but left and was replaced by Alex Grossi. A musical relationship with Quiet Riot drummer Frankie Banali continued and together they collaborated on two blues rock albums, I've Got the Blues (And It's All Your Fault) and the Vanilla Fudge inspired cover album Peanut Butter Fudge. Solo career He first recorded and released Guitar Dreams in 1998 which had liner notes penned by Steve Vai and was released initially on Think Tank Media. It was later re- released with bonus material as In Search Of Higher Ground. Other solo projects would include Absolute (2001) and Flavoured Jam (2006), which featured a rhythm section powered by Matt Bissonette and Gregg Bissonette.  BangTower  In 2010 he formed the progressive rock group BangTower with virtuoso Welsh bassist Percy Jones and LA drummer Walter Garces and the trio released the album Casting Shadows in September of that year. The follow-up single This Is My Town would come later in 2013. In December 2016, BangTower released their sophomore album, \\"With N With Out\\", which together with Citron, Jones and Garces, featured guest performances from familiar collaborator Frankie Banali (Quiet Riot), Rodger Carter (John 5, Rick Springfield, Lita Ford), Robbie Pagliari (Ohm), Jon Pomplin, Joan Fraley, Justin Stone, Chris Colovus & Josh Greenbaum. The album was engineered, mixed and mastered by Citron and much of the material was written by him, including two songs, \\"Kitty's Real Groove\\" and \\"My Father's Eyes\\" dedicated to his parents. In August 2017, he released a seven track digital-only BangTower EP titled \\"Hey, Where'd Everybody Go?\\" again teaming up with Robbie Pagliari on bass (who was recommended by Percy Jones) and Frankie Banali on acoustic percussion. This EP was mixed and mastered specifically for digital distribution by Citron. September 2019 saw BangTower release \\"The Road We Travel\\" which featured in addition to Citron and Pagliari drummer Rudd Weatherwax with horns credited to Maynard G. Krebs.  Black Cat 6  In late 2019, Citron got together with drummer Luke Fattore and bassist and Declassified Records record label owner Jon Pomplin (Sea of Monsters) to form the rock band Black Cat 6. The album \\"Scratching My Itch\\" was released in December 2019. Movie work He worked on the 1996 Tom Hanks movie That Thing You Do! as a musical instructor to the actors as well as performing guitar parts on the original band songs for the soundtrack. He also worked on 2002 hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding as editor for the film and sound engineer on the commentary for the DVD version of the film. In 2015 he worked on the Meryl Streep movie Ricki and the Flash as Streep's guitar mentor, as well as doing work on composing songs, recording and other sound duties. While being credited with extensive work as a sound engineer and producer, notable is his custom designed virtual guitar amplifier featured as part of Waves GTR3 from Waves Audio. Personal interests Citron has been training in the martial arts for over 35 years. He holds a third-degree black belt in American Tang Soo Do style of Karate under former Chuck Norris black belt Dennis Ichikawa. He also holds sixth-degree black belts in several Korean styles - Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido, and Sib Pal Gi.

Discovery and classification  Jadarite was discovered in December 2004, in drill core from the Jadar Valley () in Serbia, from which it is named. The find was located southwest of the Cer mountain. Findings were originally located in the villages of Jarebice and Slatina and later in Draginac. Exploration geologists from Rio Tinto Exploration discovered the mineral as small rounded nodules in drill core, and were unable to match it with previously known minerals. Jadarite was confirmed as a new mineral after scientists at the Natural History Museum in London and the National Research Council of Canada conducted tests on it.Whitfield, Pamela. LiNaSiB3O7(OH) a novel structure of the new borosilicate mineral jadarite determined from laboratory powder diffraction data Acta Crystallographica Section B Structural Science, International Union of Crystallography, DOI 10.1107/S0108768107010130, ISSN 0567-7408. (abstract). Chris Stanley, from the Natural History Museum, described Jadarite as being unique to mineralogy.'Kryptonite' discovered in mine. BBC News Commercialization The mineral discovery may be commercially important because the mineral contains lithium and boron, both relatively rare industrially important elements. Lithium is used for lithium batteries; boron is used in alloys, ceramic, glasses, and other applications. It is estimated that there are 200 million tons of the lithium borate ore, which would make the future Jadar mines one of the world's largest lithium deposits, supplying 10% of the world's demand for lithium. Of that, the Lower Jadar ore deposit has 114.5 million tons with an average content of the profitable components of 1.8% of lithium oxide and 13.1% of boron oxide. In May 2017, Rio Tinto announced that the Jadar area has one of the largest lithium deposits in the world, lifting Lower Jadar's deposits to 136 million tons. The company stated that the ore deposit's mineral resource estimation confirmed the quality of the mineral. Extraction is scheduled to begin in 2023, with a projected underground exploitability of 50 years. , construction of a mine has not begun. A jadarite processing plant next to the mines, which will process the ore into lithium carbonate and boric acid, is also planned. The prototype facility has been constructed by the scientists from Serbia, Australia, and USA, and is being tested in Melbourne. Testing includes the processing of the jadarite concentrate. On 25 July 2017 a memorandum was signed by Rio Tinto and the Government of Serbia, represented by the prime minister Ana Brnabiƒá, which confirmed the year 2023 as the starting year, but also revealed that only now the working groups will be formed, studies will be conducted, and the process of issuing the permits will begin. The entire enterprise was named \\"Project Jadar\\".  Kryptonite  Jadarite's chemical formula is similar but not identical to the formula (\\"sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide with fluorine\\") invented for the fictional substance kryptonite in the 2006 film Superman Returns. This coincidence attracted mass-media attention in 2007, shortly after jadarite's discovery.ABCCNNWashington Post. The new mineral, unlike the fictional material in the movie, does not contain fluorine, and does not glow green.

Traditionally, this technique is accomplished by first depleting a surface of sterling silver to bring up a thin layer of fine silver. Then 24 carat gold foil is applied with heat and pressure‚Äîmechanical gilding‚Äîto produce a permanent diffusion bond. Pure precious metals such as gold and silver have a very similar atomic structure and therefore have a good potential for bonding. Heating these metals to a temperature between 260‚Äì370¬∞C increases the movement of the atoms. When pressure is added, this causes an electron exchange at the surface between the two metals, creating a permanent diffusion bond. This diffusion bond occurs far below the soldering temperature for either metal (Dhein, 2004). Examples of this technique have probably been observed, but not positively identified on pieces from the second half of the first millennium B.C. and from the early first millennium A.D. (Oddy, 1981). This technique is used in many cultures, including Chinese, Japanese and in the West to bond gold to other metals, including iron, copper, aluminum, gold alloys, white gold, palladium and platinum. Foil made from gold alloys can be applied to silver and other metals by first depletion gilding the surface of the foil (Lewton-Brain, 1987‚Äì1993).

In 2002 Grossi re-located to Los Angeles and quickly became one the hardest working guitarists in town, eventually landing him the guitar spot in Quiet Riot when the band re-formed in 2004. Grossi toured with Quiet Riot in 2005 and 2006 throughout America, Europe, South America and Asia and contributed songwriting on the songs \\"Free\\" and \\"Strange Daze\\" for the 2006 Rehab and joined in for the album's 2007 tour, which included feature slots at the 2007 Sweden Rock Festival as well as the first annual Rocklahoma Festival. Grossi remained in the band until vocalist Kevin DuBrow's death. Quiet Riot disbanded in January 2008, but has since been revived by Frankie Banali and has been touring again since 2010. Along with Dizzy Reed of Guns N' Roses, Grossi formed Hookers & Blow in 2003, shortly after Grossi's move to L.A. Dizzy Reed suggested the band's name as something for people to \\"Pay attention to.\\" The group does not write music, and tours for fun with different lineups of all-star musicians. Grossi has also written, toured and recorded with such artists as Bang Tango, Steven Adler of Guns N' Roses, Adler's Appetite, Jani Lane of Warrant, Beautiful Creatures, Love/Hate, Skid Row, Dizzy Reed of Guns N' Roses (in Hookers & Blow), Orange County hardcore band Ignite and Elektra Records singer/songwriter Aimee Allen. In 2009 Grossi took part in the [PRS ROAD SHOW], put on by Paul Reed Smith guitars. In 2010 Adler's Appetite released \\"Alive\\", a new single. The song was released in conjunction with Adler's New York Times Bestseller tell-all biography \\"My Appetite for Detstruction: Sex, Drugs and Guns N' Roses\\" and debuted on The Howard Stern Show in July. The band also did a 50 city US tour in support of the release. On September 13, 2010, it was announced that Quiet Riot would be reforming with the line up which would include Grossi, Frankie Banali and Chuck Wright. In 2011 Grossi formed Hotel Diablo. The band entered the studio with former Guns N' Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke producing. They released the first track \\"Set it Off\\" via iTunes and band played its first show at the Whisky a go go in Hollywood on September 2, 2011. In July 2012 it was announced that Hotel Diablo had signed a worldwide deal with Scarlet Records and Entertainment One for the release of the band's full-length debut \\"The Return To Psycho, California\\", which will be released on September 25, 2012, worldwide. Grossi has had music placed in multiple T.V. shows and motion pictures including the Quincy Jones produced film The Smokers, the FX hit series Sons of Anarchy as well as the Walt Disney/Touchstone picture The Proposal and the VH1 series Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew. He has also done several TV appearances including a 2003 documentary on the Rhode Island nightclub fire for the Lifetime network. He appears on Dizzy Reed's debut solo album, Rock 'N Roll Ain't Easy, a record that has been in the making for over ten years.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed May 13, 2011 tributary of the Kankakee River in the Central Corn Belt Plains ecoregion, located in northern Indiana in the United States. Via the Kankakee and Illinois rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of . The river's name possibly derives from a translation of the Shawnee name for the river, We-thau-ka-mik, meaning \\"yellow waters\\", a description perhaps owing to the presence of sand in the riverbed. Course Significant portions of the Yellow River's course have been straightened and channelized; the river's present-day course is considered to begin at a confluence of agricultural ditches in southeastern St. Joseph County, approximately north of the town of Bremen. The river initially flows southwardly into Marshall County, past Bremen; then generally southwestwardly, returning to its naturally winding riverbed and flowing through the city of Plymouth; and westwardly in a substantially straightened course through Starke County, past the city of Knox. It flows into the Kankakee River in southwestern Starke County, approximately west of Knox near the town of English Lake. Watershed The Yellow River is bounded by the St. Joseph River of Lake Michigan on the north, flowing through Elkhart, Mishawaka, and South Bend. To the east is the Elkhart River, a branch of the St. Joseph, all flowing to Lake Michigan, through the lower lakes to the St. Lawrence River and reaching the North Atlantic. On the south and the southeast, it is bounded by the drainage of the Tippecanoe River. The Tippecanoe River flows southward into the Wabash River, emptying into the Ohio, then into the Mississippi River, expelling its waters into the Gulf of Mexico. To the southwest is the Iroquois River a tributary of the Kankakee River, as is the Yellow River. The Yellow River is the second-largest tributary of the Kankakee. The Iroquois River is larger and joins the Kankakee across the border in Illinois. The Kankakee River joins the Des Plaines River south of Joliet, Illinois, forming the Illinois River. Together they flow the length of the state of Illinois before joining the Mississippi River, north of St. Louis. History=Potawatomi Main Poc was a warrior and chief among the Yellow River Potawatomi first coming to notice at the Treaty of Greenville (July 1795), which was to bring peace to the frontier. Within a year, Main Poc was leading raiding parties across the Mississippi into Spanish Territory.Edmunds, R. David; The Potawatomis, Keepers of the Fire, 1978 By 1804, Main Poc and Turkey Foot were raiding throughout the Midwest and deep into Tennessee and Kentucky. When they reached across the Mississippi to attack the Osage in what had become the U.S.'s Louisiana Territory, the American military called for a council. Main Poc and Turkey Foot did not attend and kept traveling out of their Yellow River communities to raid other Indian villages. Soon other Potawatomi villages were taking after Main Poc and raiding elsewhere. In 1807, Tecumseh and his brother, the prophet came to Indiana and Main Poc joined in his plans to hold back the white settlers. With Main Poc's move to Prophetstown in 1809, the Yellow River was no longer the seat of war among the Potawatomis. After the defeat of Tecumseh at the Battle of Tippecanoe and then at the Battle of the Thames (October 5, 1813), peace returned to northern Indiana. Main Poc returned to the Yellow River after the 1814 Treaty of Greenville. His new village was between Plymouth and Knox. In 1816 he died, leaving the pro-American Chiefs firmly in place. By 1814, Menominee was a prominent leader of the Twin Lakes Potawatomi.Tanner, Helen Hornbeck, Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History, University of Oklahoma Press; Norman, Oklahoma; 1987, Map 21 He had become known to the Indian Agents as early as 1791 as a leader among the Twin Lakes Potawatomi. In 1820 he got Isaac McCoy, a Protestant Missionary to come to the Yellow River. Menominee was a religious chief and he planned to combine the teaching of Tecumseh and the Prophet with Roman Catholicism. He was seeking a way for his people to cope with the growing number of settlers. The Carey Mission was established on the St. Joseph River, north of the Twin Lakes in the area where Niles, Michigan now stands. In the 1830s, Carey's mission declined and was replaced by a Roman Catholic Mission. In 1833, the fathers expanded their mission to the Yellow River Potawatomi. These two communities would be the heart of the resistance to removal. By 1830, there were three substantial Potawatomi villages on the Yellow River, each with its own chief.Tanner, Helen Hornbeck, Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History, University of Oklahoma Press; Norman, Oklahoma; 1987, Map 25 Notawkah (Rattlesnake) was the leader of the village east of the Yellow River, south of Plymouth. He moved to Kansas when chief Menominee refused to leave Indiana in 1837. Mackahtahmoah (Black Wolf) was chief of the western village, near the Starke and Marshall county lines. Pepinawah was another chief among these villages. In 1832, during the Indian removal period, a group of Potawatomi chiefs signed a treaty with the U.S. government setting aside for the Potawatomi in perpetuity an area of 14,000 acres (57 km2) in the vicinity of the Yellow River; this land was sold at the 1836 Treaty of Yellow River, signed by three Potawatomi chiefs, which stipulated that all Potawatomi move west of the Mississippi River within two years. Chief Menominee refused to sign any treaty, which gave away Indian lands. Still, the land was taken by the Treaty of Tippecanoe. When the Potawatomi of Indiana were being rounded up for transportation to the west, Menominee's village became the gathering place of those who did not agree to go. When Menominee again refused to allow his village to be removed by August 6, 1838, the reservation was opened to squatters. When the Potawatomi destroyed the huts of squatters, the whites retaliated by burning the Indians cabins. In an attempt to prevent bloodshed, Governor David Wallace of Indiana authorized the enlistment of volunteers. Menominee was lured to a meeting to allow for the militia to surround his village and take the Potawatomi into custody. On September 4, 1838, the Potawatomi of Indiana began their march to Kansas, the Trail of Death. Menominee's band of 859 people were forcibly removed to Kansas in 1838, in an event known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death. River engineering At the time of European settlement, the area of the confluence of the Yellow and Kankakee Rivers was a densely vegetated marsh, seven miles (11 km) long, known as English Lake. The lower Yellow River was confined to a straightened channel and the wetland was drained and converted to farmland by the 1910s. A spit of land between the straightened Yellow and Kankakee channels was established by the state of Indiana as the Kankakee State Fish and Wildlife Area in 1933 and converted back to marshland. The straightened section of the Yellow River in Starke County, which had historically been a swampy and winding stream with numerous oxbow lakes, was the subject of a 2004 effort by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to address excess accumulation of sediment in the river's streambed as a result of channelization.

Early life and family Coney was born in Auckland on 22 October 1944, the daughter of Doris Margaret Pearce (n√©e Morgan) and Tom Pearce. Her father chaired the Auckland Regional Council from 1965 to 1976 and was a New Zealand Rugby Football Union administrator. Coney was educated at Auckland Girls' Grammar School, and went on to study at the University of Auckland, where she completed a Bachelor of Arts degree. Activist career She is best known for her co-authorship (with Phillida Bunkle) of a Metro magazine article that alleged that women had been experimented on, without their consent, at National Women's Hospital in Auckland. The article, titled 'The Unfortunate Experiment', led to the controversial Cartwright Inquiry, which confirmed the article's allegations. The article and the subsequent inquiry are seen as a turning point in healthcare ethics in New Zealand. Coney has been involved in other women's health causes, and in 1984 co-founded with Bunkle Women's Health Action to co-ordinate claims by women who had been injured by the Dalkon Shield IUD.Women's Health Action ‚Äì Everybody ‚Äì Health Information for New Zealanders Coney was the co-founder of the feminist magazine Broadsheet, which she co-edited for 14 years.

She wrote a regular column of political and social comment for the Sunday-Times for 16 years from 1986. She is also involved in the local politics of the Piha area such as the unsuccessful campaign against the Piha cafe. She has also written an history of Piha, and is currently researching Anzac soldiers from the Piha area. Political career Between 2001 and 2010, Coney represented Waitakere City on the Auckland Regional Council (ARC), and served as Chair of the Parks and Heritage Committee between 2004 and 2010. In October 2010, she was elected as a representative of the WaitƒÅkere Ward on the Auckland Council on the Best for the West ticket.

Trolleybus production by the Uritsky factory (ZiU) began in 1951, but the company's first model, the MTB-82d, was a refinement of a design first developed several years earlier, by the national government in Moscow in 1945‚Äì46, the MTB-82m (where MTB stood for Moscow Trolleybus). A prototype MTB-82m was built in February 1946 at a military factory. Following the construction of 77 additional MTB-82 trolleybuses in 1946‚Äì47, improvements in the design led to the introduction of the MTB-82d. Production of the improved model continued at military factories as well as at MTRZ, a small trolleybus repair plant in Moscow, until 1951, when the Uritsky factory was established in Engels to take over all trolleybus production from the various smaller facilities. ZiU's production of the MTB-82d lasted from 1951 to 1961, and a total of 3,746 were built (or more than 5,000 when counting the ones built elsewhere, before ZiU was established).Sorokin, Anatol (July‚ÄìAugust 2008). \\"A Trolleybus 'For all Times': MTB-82\\".

It is based upon the lives of five indigenous people who dealt with the issues of forceful removal by the Australian government. Plot Stolen tells the story of five Aboriginal children, who go by the names of Sandy, Ruby, Jimmy, Anne, and Shirley. Sandy has spent his entire life on the run, never having a set home to live in. Stolen tracks his quest for a place to be, a place where he doesn‚Äôt have to keep hiding from the government (even though they are no longer after him), and a place he can call home. Ruby was forced to work as a domestic from a young age and was driven insane by the abuse of her white masters. In the latter part of the play, she spends a lot of her time mumbling to herself, whilst her family desperately try to help her. Jimmy was separated from his mother at a very young age, and she spent her entire life looking for him. He spent a lot of time in prison, and on the day he finally got out, he was told about his mother‚Äôs search. As he went to meet her, she died, and he committed suicide. Jimmy was led to believe that his mother was deceased as any letters written to him were taken away by the institution. Anne was removed from her family and placed in a Caucasian family‚Äôs home. She was materially happy in this home, a lot happier than many of the other characters. Shirley was removed from her parents and had her children removed from her. She only felt, safety, and comfort when her granddaughter was born, and not removed. Writing style The play is split between the stories of the five characters, both as children and as adults. It leaps backwards and forwards through time without warning, and changes location quite dramatically. In one scene, the five children may be in a schoolyard, and in the next scene, one adult may be alone in their room, or taking care of their unstable brother. This is due to creating an almost 'memory like' form of a sequence, with each scene being connected by a stray thought instead of being connected in a chronological order. Because of these elements, which aren‚Äôt found in many plays, Stolen is a favourite on Australian high school syllabi. * aboriginal children language * native: yurringa= sun * wrong pronunciation: pitcha=picture * double negation * monologues intermixed with dialogues * alienation effects: rapid scene changes, projections, sound-effects * Ironic elements (Welfare, Sandy) Original cast and crew Stolen was performed at The C.U.B.

Vietnamese art has a long and rich history, the earliest examples of which date back as far as the Stone Age around 8,000 BCE. With the millennium of Chinese domination starting in the 2nd century BC, Vietnamese art undoubtedly absorbed many Chinese influences, which would continue even following independence from China in the 10th century AD. However, Vietnamese art has always retained many distinctively Vietnamese characteristics. By the 19th century, the influence of French art took hold in Vietnam, having a large hand in the birth of modern Vietnamese art. Traditional art=Neolithic art Terracotta pieces used to imprint decoration patterns on cloth Pottery dating to the Stone Age (c. 8000 BCE) has been found in Bac Son, Vietnam. This pottery was made from clay, and in its beginnings was largely basic and lacking any artistic flare. Moving into the neolithic era, however, Vietnamese pottery and ceramics started to develop rapidly, showing signs of decor. Bronze Age art The highly developed ƒê√¥ng S∆°n culture that flourished in North Vietnam (from about 1000 BC to the 4th century BC) was the civilization responsible for the world- famous ƒê√¥ng S∆°n drums, a product of their advanced bronze-casting skills. These drums give us an important peek into early Vietnamese life. They were elaborately decorated with geometric patterns, and most importantly, depicted scenes of everyday life such as farming, warriors donning feather headdresses, construction of ships, musicians, etc. Archaeological evidence from this period also shows that people in the area had long been weaving cloth. Many of the people depicted on the drums are shown as wearing elaborate clothing. Chinese domination from 111 BC to 939 AD During the ten centuries of rule by the Chinese, Vietnamese began to apply newly learned Chinese techniques to art and specifically ceramics, however this was in conjunction with the continued production of art based on native methods; this is proven by excavation of Chinese tombs in the area.http://www.vietnamartbooks.com/articles/article.html?id=67 Pottery and ceramics during Chinese rule From the Ng√¥ to Tr·∫ßn Dynasty Vietnamese art and ceramics during this period of independence (approximately 10th to 15th centuries) flourished. The ceramics from this period were thought to have been largely influenced by both ancient native styles and the Tang and later Song Dynasty's art, including applying the \\"three colors\\" concept to its ceramics. Chinese-influenced philosophies adopted by the Vietnamese such as Confucianism, Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism all had a lasting impression on Vietnamese art. Some also claim there are small traces of Cham influences to be found as well. The L√Ω Dynasty, beginning in the 11th century is viewed specifically as the golden age of Vietnamese art, and its ceramics became famous across East and Southeast Asia. The L√Ω Dynasty also saw the construction of many of Vietnam's landmark structures, including the Temple of Literature, One-pillar pagoda, and Quynh Lam pagoda. The Tr·∫ßn Dynasty that immediately followed in the 13th century saw a more subdued approach to art. Fourth Chinese domination and L√™ Dynasty Pieces of wooden art from 17th and 18th century The fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam was quite short- lived, lasting only about 2 decades, yet it was also seen as the harshest domination. Many if not most classical Vietnamese books were burnt, and thus much documentation of the era of independence lost. It is said that a more extreme than-ever process of sinicization was enforced, and countless Vietnamese resources and goods were removed and taken to China. =Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty= The Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty, the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam, saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art. Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics. Despite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty. Modern art Vietnam Modern Art includes artistic work materialized during colonial period between the 1860s to 1970s, and significantly ascribed to the founding of ‚ÄúEcole Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine‚Äù in October 1925. Before 1925, paintings and carvings were mainly created for religious purpose, in a decorative manner for example lacquered furniture and utilitarian ceramic and porcelains, subordinated to demands by the local temples and pagodas use. A striking ‚Äúshift‚Äù was obvious after the founding of Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine EBAI, observing a gradual change in perception of art, and the beginning recognition of art for art's sake. Vietnamese artists experimented with new ways of seeing, with ideas from 2 important French teachers, it marks an intensifying cultural transfer and modernity.  The Colonial Period 1925 - 1945  left Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine EBAI was founded by Victor Tardieu, a French academic and naturalist painter.ibid, p5 With a report commission sent to the general Government of Indochina, Victor Tardieu recommended setting up a school ‚ÄúEBAI in Indochina‚Äù to train real artists. Unlike, Ecole professionnelle‚Äù in Hanoi, ‚ÄúEcole des Arts Cambodgeins‚Äù and other three schools set up in Cochinchina between 1902 ‚Äì 1913 these schools were professional schools to train craftsmen. Tardieu's idea was to adapt existing curriculum used in ‚ÄúEcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris‚Äù by including art history; technical course like oil painting and perspective, to train student into real artist. He planned to ‚Äúhelp the Vietnamese artist to get back in touch with the deep meaning and fundamental inspiration of their own traditions‚Äù. The magazine publications Ng√†y Nay ('Today') and Phong Ho√° ('Mores') which were associated with T·ª± L·ª±c vƒÉn ƒëo√†n (Self Reliance Literary Association), were committed to modernising Vietnamese culture through the crucial assessment of both Vietnam's tradition and Western modernity. Students in the EBAI were columnist in this 2 weekly magazines, illustrating cartoons and exhibition information. The stylized cartoon illustration were in fact very modern, depicting simple messages. = Oil Painting = 270x270px Following closely to the curriculum of Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris, oil painting was first introduced to students as a completely new medium. Although western art, in this case, oil painting, was likely first encountered by Le Van Mien (1873-1943) in L‚ÄôEcole Nationale Superieure des Beaux- Arts de Paris, who returned to Hanoi in 1895, no record shows that he taught and trained craftsman in Bien Hoa or Gia Dinh this western medium. This medium was thoroughly unknown to the students, and Joseph Inguimberty though it would be hard to assimilate the oil painting techniques to them. Artist like To Ngoc Van was able to combine western aesthetic techniques like linear perspective, imitation of nature and modelling in the round into his own oriental traditions with oil medium. Stylized as the ‚Äòpoetic reality‚Äô style, his works sets female ideals into a linear perspective in an enclosed space, juxtapositioned with flat coloured area, his works emulates with the tendency idealization imagery. = En Plein Air = Similarly, en plein air was another major practice instituted in EBAI's curriculum. Students were brought outdoor for field trips to develop their painting sense of the environment. As noted by art historian Nora Taylor, > ‚Äú[He ‚Ä¶ propped his easel under a tree by rice paddy, took off his shirt and > proceeded to sketch farmers planting their rice seedlings. Needless to say > he earned quite a few giggles and embarrassed glances from his subjects.‚Äô > Nobody took off their shirts in public, not even the farmers in the fields. > The French did and so did To Ngoc Van.‚Äù This example quoted by Taylor, argues that the tendency of idealization, we see in To Nga Van's painting reflects a distancing and detachment with the subject matter, a result of artist's attempt to emulate their French teachers inclusive of whatever they do. Other than oil medium and en plein air painting method, significant assimilation and adaption of local culture were encouraged by Victor Tardieu and his successor Joseph Imguimberty. = Lacquer Painting = left alt= Joseph Imguimberty was fascinated by the lacquered cultural objects and architecture fixtures after visiting the Temple of Literature in Hanoi. He encouraged his students to start using lacquer as a fine art medium, and set up workshops in EBAI with old artisans, playing a renaissance role in Lacquer painting. > ‚Äúfalling back on the past will be efficient only if it is used as a starting > point for a new research, for an evolution in line with the contemporary > eras; to summarise, the question is to evolve as contemporaries within an > extensive of tradition.‚ÄùVictor Tardieu Lacquer painting by Nguyen Gia Tri shows distinctive French influence of \\"romantic realism\\" style, yet a blend of localized culture iconography within the work Making lacquer painting takes several months, using resin from Son tree taken from the plantation from Son Mai region, numerous layers of application are applied to acquire the desired colour and effects. Most notable artist who excelled in this medium is Nguyen Gia Tri. Although artists like Tran Quang Tran, Le Pho, Pham Hau, Nguyen Khang and Nguyen Van Que attempted lacquer painting, Nguyen Gia Tri's achievement in lacquer painting is remarkable for his research on pigments and exploration of new lacquer colours. Nguyen Gia Tri's aim ‚Äú was to obtain the same level of painting as with the oil medium regarding perspective, modelling in the round, and infinite variation of colours‚Äù. = Silk Painting = Le Pho silk painting styled closely similar to a classic \\"Madonna nursing baby\\" triangle composition Other artists like Nguyen Phanh Chanh, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Tran Van Can, Le Van De, who were the first batch of students to be admitted in EBAI, are most notable for their silk painting.ibid, pg 8 Like lacquer painting, silk painting was much encouraged for exploration in the school. Different from similar practice of silk painting in China and Japan, an intensifying of cultural transfer was observed in Vietnamese silk painting, artist like Nguyen Phan Chan blended western composition principle with eastern tradition like calligraphy and brush paintings. Choi o an quan (Mandarin square) Children Playing a Game of Squares In 1931, Paris International Colonial Exhibition, Nguyen Phan Chan‚Äôs work titled Children Playing a Game of Squares was well-received and this recognition firmly established the medium as a modern Vietnamese expression. Between 1930 ‚Äì 1936, Nguyen Phan Chan, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu and Nguyen Gia Tri, graduated from EBAI. Victor Tardieu died in 1937 and he was took after by Evariste Jonchere. To Ngoc Van begin teaching in EBAI in 1937. Artists like Bui Xuan Phai and Nguyen Tu Nghiem who entered EBAI in 1941 was unable to complete the full five-year programme due to the 1945 revolution. A bombing of Hanoi that was intended for Japanese target destroyed part of the EBAI painting department in 1943, resulting the sculpture department to be moved to Son Tay; Architecture and sculpture department to Dalat while applied arts went to Phu Ly.  The Time of Resistance wars 1945 - 1975  Resistance war uproar marks the official close down of EBAI in 1945. Democratic Republic of Vietnam reopened a fine arts school in Hanoi for a short period of time in September 1945 ruled by To Ngoc Van. However, artist were sympathetic of the Viet Minh and decided to leave Hanoi to join the resistance movement against French in the Hills of Tay Bac. = Artists in the North = Notable group of artists in the North during the Cold War were T√¥ Ng·ªçc V√¢n, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn C·∫©n, Hu·ª≥nh Ph∆∞∆°ng ƒêong, Ph·∫°m Thanh T√¢m, Minh Tuyen, Hoang Trung. Another small number of artists from well- to-do backgrounds had the opportunity to go to France and make their careers there for the most part. Full text available here Examples include Le Thi Luu, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Le Van De, Le Ba Dang and Pham Tang. When Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam's independence on 2 September 1945, Vietnamese artist begin to resist the influence of romantic realism, tendency for nostalgia past and melancholic dreams. Artist like To Ngoc Van shook off his romantic style and turned towards modern realism, he moved the closed EBAI (after the Japanese coup de force in March 1945) to Viet Bac in 1950, the military base of the Revolutionary Army under Ho Chi Minh. > ‚Äú[He]‚Ä¶ decided that art, as the French saw it, died in 1945 when Viet Nam > declared its independence and was reborn in 1946 when the Viet Minh moved > the art school to the hills of Viet Bac, the seat of the revolutionary > movement. In 1946, he declared proudly ‚Äòtradition starts now.‚Äô‚Äù To Ngoc Van's painting style changed drastically away from the usual ideal women he painted before the resistance war. To Ngoc Van begin teaching resistance art classes in the Northern zone during the war with the French. This includes setting up the \\"School of Fine Arts in the Resistance Zone\\", and combating against decadent art being scientific, national and popular, art have to abandon religion, mythical and idealists theme, focusing solely on the inspiration and needs of the revolution and being appealing and educational to a majority of people. Hence artists like Nguyen Hiem, Nguyen Sang, Phan Van Don and Tran Van Can created works that depicted the countrysides, portraits of peasants, soldiers battles scenes, they uphold the belief that artist should show the reality of society instead of idealised imageries. To Ngoc Van died in 1954 as the result of injuries received at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, School of Fine Arts in the Resistance Zone was later moved to Hanoi in 1955 and named as the ‚ÄúVietnam College of Fine Arts‚Äù with Tran Van Can as the principal. Mai Van Hien, Meeting (Gap Nhau), gouache on paper, 1954 First National Art Exhibition in the Democratic Republic of Vietna in 1955, after the victory at Dien Bein Phu where Meeting (Gap Nhau) by Mai Van Hien was praised as the ideal painting that illustrates the idea of community and solidarity between the soldiers and the common people. \\"The mood of the painting is reflected in the artist‚Äôs simple descriptive style, which lends itself well to its content.\\" > In a Painting Exhibition that in happened December 10, 1951, Ho Chi Minh > sent a message to the artists that \\"you, in the artistic field, have your > own responsibilities - to serve the resistance, the Fatherland and the > people, first and foremost the workers, peasants and soldiers,\\"Ho Chi Minh, > ‚ÄúMessage sent to the artists on the occasion of the 1951 Paintings > Exhibition (December 10, 1951)‚Äù, Selected Works of Ho Chi Minh Vol. 3, > Publisher: Foreign Languages Publishing House. Reproduced on > https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ho-chi-minh/works/1951/12/10.htm However, various debates erupted in Hanoi on the role of artists in Society in 1956, during the first meeting of the writers and artist associations, members demanded for greater freedom of expression which went against what Ho Chi Minh had earlier laid down. Two art and literature journals Nhan Van (humanism) and Gia Pham (Art Works) that supported the argument were subsequently banned. Following year, Vietnam Association of Fine Arts in Hanoi or National Arts Association was established with 108 member headed by Thai Ba Van. These members were required to be members of the association if they wished their works to be exhibited or sold. There were no private galleries where artists can displayed their work formally. Eventually, this association was governed with official rules and regulations, members are obligated to hold one exhibition at local level annually and another at national level every 5 years. Non members were not considered artist, hence they have no opportunity to display any form of art publicly. Between 1950 and 70s, members were paid as ‚Äúart workers‚Äù for the poster designs and illustrations, among few were elites who painted paintings for state visitors. Realist style, which corresponded with Northern artists initial aspirations, was vital in the early days of revolution, however, due to the strict constraints by the DVR regime and decreasing subsidies, realist trend reached an apex in the 60s. Strict guidelines were attempted to established in 1962, on the productions of artists artworks, they need to portray a \\"National Character\\", subject matters were usually the countryside, battle scene, portrait of Uncle Ho. = National Paintings = Anti-colonial and resistance war culminated the appropriation of ‚Äúnational‚Äù art. It was a period to essentially erase the impact and influence of the French. Works painted by Nam Son, Tran Van Can, Nguyen Sang, Tran Dong Luon were in fact in the medium Lacquer, silk and oil medium.

His professors in the resistance zone were trained from the EBAI‚Äù the drawings and diary clearly contents ‚Äúlyrical and poetic quality‚Äù it was regarded as ideal paintings.[21] Hence, art curator Joyce Fan argues that ‚Äúthe realist techniques thus imparted by the French continue to manifest in the paintings with the sense of detachment and distancing, unlike the social realist use of emotive values to heighten the pathos in the imagery.‚Äù[22] Likewise, the undeniable fact that, the intense cultural transfer during colonial period continues to influence local artist after the exit of the French. = Propaganda Posters = A South Vietnamese propaganda poster depicting the countryside Propaganda poster painted during the period of ‚Äúoperation rolling thunder‚Äù in 1965 reflects a clear anti-colonial and anti-imperial messages. Likely inspired by the Soviet and Communist Chinese, they carried a political intention. Following strictly to the culture of new Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh's concept, was to \\"stimulate intellectual and artistic creativity for art and cultural development\\".[23] ‚ÄúCulture is seen as a powerful motor of development, and cultural identity as a constant in the harmonious development of society and the individual.‚Äù [24] \\"images such as those presented in the propaganda posters and paintings of the time were key indicators of how the population was to perceive the environment, the government, and the future. the posters and paintings were sometimes the only voices the people heard, the only clues they had to knowing and how to respond.\\"[25] = Artists in the South = Vietnam was divided at the 17 parallel after the Geneva Conference in 1954 separating themselves into the Soviet and Chinese supported North against the Southern Republic reinforced by the United States of America. This divided Vietnam forced some artists to fled to Saigon and continue their practices in the republic of Vietnam, most notable artist is Ta Ty, who \\" considerably bolstered the South‚Äôs artistic development in the following years and profoundly contributed to the foundation of the Young Artists Association in 1966, though he chose to remain anonymous in its list of founding members due to privacy reasons.\\" Nguyen Gia Tri decided to move to Gia Dinh and eventually became the director for ‚ÄúEcole des beaux-art in Gia Dinh\\" founded in 1954.[26] Evident in their works, due to accessibility of information, their artworks were styled as western influenced, more eclectic, experimental, subjective and individualism. They enjoyed more freedom in the subject matters and exhibited freely until 1975.[27] In 1962, the first international Exhibition of Fine Arts of Saigon was held with 21 countries participating it. Southern artist encountered abstract painting for the first time. Following up, a second exhibition was planned for 1966, but unfortunately cancelled due to the increase intensity of the war. In 1966, Saigon Society of Young Artist (Hoi Hoa Si Tre Saigon) was founded campaigning to develop modern art, members include Nguyen Trung and Trinh Cung.[14] Between 1960s - 70s artists in Saigon experimented abstraction and other contemporary expressions. As noted by Vietnamese art historian Hyunh-Beattie, Southern artists did not readily accepted and took in American culture, which they deem as inferior to the French. Although Americans were heavily involved in Saigon, Beattie argues that little had influenced on the art scene in republic. After the reunification of Vietnam, southern artists were sent for re-education in 1975.[14] 1976, Hanoi government merged Ho Chi Minh city and Gia Dinh National School for decorative Arts and the Saigon College of Fine Arts into Ho Chi Minh City Fine Arts College, and established Ho Chi Minh City branch of The Vietnam Association of Fine Arts.[14]  The Period of Renewal from 1985  Artists benefited from greater freedom of expression after the launch of the ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi campaign. The economic reforms allowed artists a greater outlet for creative expressions.[14] However, Nguyen Quan who was elected into the executive committee of Vietnam Association of Fine Arts and holding position as the chief editor of the Association's Magazine My Thuat (Fine Arts) was removed from his position after organizing a workshop with 30 artist in Dai Lai, North of Hanoi in 1986.[28] The workshop was not acceptable by authority for \\"the retreat not only promoted individual expression and art for art's sake, it also went against what the state had instituted over the past three decades in that it allowed for artists to explore their individuality rather than represent that collective sentiments of their community.\\"[29] Contemporary Art Nowadays, besides working with traditional material like oil, acrylic, lacquer on wood, the younger generation of Vietnamese artists have become very active in involving different forms of arts, such as installation, performance and video art with many of them attaining international recognition for their artworks and exhibitions worldwide.http://hyperallergic.com/181080/in-vietnam-contemplating-the-future- of-contemporary-art/ For example, Nha San Collective (formerly Nha San Studio) - established in 1998, was the first artist-led, non-profit initiative to be run in Vietnam.http://theculturetrip.com/asia/vietnam/articles/the-most- influential-contemporary-art-spaces-in-vietnam/ Nha San studio nurtured the first generation of Vietnamese avant-garde artists emergent in the early 1990s http://www.lasalle.edu.sg/trending-stories/in-conversation-with-jeffrey-say/ RMIT University Vietnam art collection is one of the most prestigious collections of contemporary Vietnamese art in the world. This collection is not only historically important, but one that will continue to grow the understanding of Vietnamese culture for generations to come. The Vietnamese artists in the collection range from established and mid-career artists, whose works feature in significant exhibitions and notable private collections and public institutions worldwide, to young emerging artists who continue to tackle issues with fresh and new interpretations. RMIT University is at the forefront of creative education and this collection allows both students and the wider community to experience the artistic expression of an important generation of contemporary Vietnamese artists. The art collection is managed by the RMIT Library Vietnam. CinemaArchitecture It is believed that in prehistoric times, Vietnamese people lived in stilt-houses, as depicted on the bronze Dong Son drums. Similar kinds of houses can still be found in Vietnam today. When Chinese influence permeated Vietnam, Chinese architecture had a large influence on the basic structure of many types of Vietnamese buildings, mostly pagodas and temples, communal houses, houses of scholar- bureaucrats, aristocracy, and imperial palaces and quarters. Nevertheless, these structures combined both Chinese influences and native style. With French colonization of Vietnam in the 19th century, many French-styled buildings were constructed, including villas, government buildings, opera houses, etc. Many of these buildings still stand in Vietnam and are one of the clearest remnants of the French colonial legacy. Some of Vietnam's most notable architectural structures include: *The Temple of Literature or (VƒÉn Mi·∫øu): Located in Hanoi, North Vietnam. It was constructed during the L√Ω Dynasty and dedicated to Confucius and his disciples. It is a fine example of the elegance of L√Ω Dynasty architecture, although much of it is in need of repair. The Temple of Literature is a series of courtyards, buildings and pavilions, the center of which houses the famed stone steles. These steles are placed on top of stone turtles, and are inscribed with the names of doctorate candidates successful at the Imperial examination. Also within the temple lies the \\"Qu·ªëc T·ª≠ Gi√°m\\" or National University, which functioned for approximately 700 years, from 1076 to 1779. *Imperial City, Hu·∫ø: During the reign of the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty, a new imperial citadel in Hu·∫ø was built, largely based on the Chinese Forbidden City in Beijing, and also called the Purple Forbidden City. However, it still employed many obvious Vietnamese characteristics in its design. Other imperial structures were built later, such as the outlying tomb of Kh·∫£i ƒê·ªãnh, which used French architectural elements as well. The tomb of Minh M·∫°ng is often considered as one of the most beautiful structures in Hu·∫ø, situated near a vast lotus pond. Its construction was not completed until after Minh M·∫°ng's death. The citadel formerly sprawled a vast estate, but during subsequent wars and conflicts, much of it had been destroyed and later turned into rice paddies. The remaining areas are currently being restored by UNESCO. *One Pillar Pagoda: The one pillar pagoda is one of the most ancient structures of Hanoi, its design credited to Emperor L√Ω Th√°i T·ªï. The story goes that the emperor had longed for a son, and one day dreamed that the Goddess of Mercy was sitting on a lotus flower offering him a son. In gratitude and reverence of his dream he ordered the construction of a small pagoda in the form of a lotus, overlooking a pond. The pagoda has been rebuilt countlessly due to it being destroyed and burnt in wars by opponents. *Perfume Pagoda: The Perfume pagoda is an ancient structure in Ha Tay province, located in the Perfume Mountain, and is the site for a yearly festival attended by hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese people. Most people reach the pagoda by taking an hour boat ride across the scenic river (passing the countryside scattered with smaller pagodas) before reaching the Perfume Pagoda itself. Inside are a series of temples and structures, and a grotto with stairs leading to two paths: \\"Heaven's gate\\" and \\"Hell's gate\\". Descending deep into the grotto one finds the Inner temple. The beauty of the Perfume Pagoda and surrounding areas have served as the subject in many Vietnamese poems. Calligraphy Calligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using Chinese characters along with ch·ªØ n√¥m. However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based qu·ªëc ng·ªØ, which has proven to be very popular. In the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life. On special occasions such as the Lunar New Year, people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words). People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at temple shrines. Visual arts=Silk painting Silk painting portrait of Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i (15th century) Vietnamese silk painting is one of the most popular forms of art in Vietnam, favored for the mystical atmosphere that can be achieved with the medium. During the 19th and 20th centuries, French influence was absorbed into Vietnamese art and the liberal and modern use of color especially began to differentiate Vietnamese silk paintings from their Chinese, Japanese and Korean counterparts.Art of Vietnam Vietnamese silk paintings typically showcase the countryside, landscapes, pagodas, historical events or scenes of daily life. Woodblock prints ƒê√¥ng H·ªì folk woodblock print of a carp A folk art with a long history in Vietnam, Vietnamese woodblock prints have reached a level of popularity outside of Vietnam.Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David: Vietnam Past and Present: The North (History and culture of Hanoi and Tonkin). Chiang Mai. Cognoscenti Books, 2012. ASIN: B006DCCM9Q. Organic materials are used to make the paint, which is used on wood and pressed on paper. The process is repeated with different colors. Photography Photographic technology was introduced to Vietnam in the mid 19th century by French and Chinese commercial photographers. Since its introduction a diverse range of photography practices have emerged such as fine art photography, documentary photography, and landscape photography. The development of such practices have been accelerated following ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi, that has resulted in a diversification of funding for artists and increased international exposure. Ceramic=Performing arts=Traditional music Traditional Vietnamese music is extremely diverse, consisting of many different styles varying from region to region. Some of the most widely known genres include: *Quan h·ªç: A type of improvisational music, it is sung a cappella and has a longstanding tradition in Vietnam, used in courtship rituals. *Imperial Court music: Music performed in the Vietnamese court during feudalistic times. When referring specifically to the \\"Nh√£ nh·∫°c\\" form it includes court music from the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty on to the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty. It features an array of instruments, featuring musicians and dancers adorned in elaborate garb. *Ca tr√π: An ancient form of chamber music which originated in the imperial court. It gradually came to be associated with a geisha-type of entertainment where talented female musicians entertained rich and powerful men, often scholars and bureaucrats who most enjoyed the genre. It was condemned in the 20th century by the government, being tied falsely with prostitution, but recently it has seen a revival as appreciation for its cultural significance has grown. Vietnam has completed documents to have Ca tru recognized by UNESCO as a potential Intangible Cultural Heritage. Traditional theatre Tuong theatre actors. Genres include: *C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng: A kind of modern folk opera originating in South Vietnam, which utilizes extensive vibrato techniques. It remains very popular in modern Vietnam when compared to other folk styles. *H√°t ch√®o: The most mainstream of theatre/music forms in the past, enjoyed widely by the public rather than the more obscure Ca tr√π which was favored more by scholars and elites. *H√°t tu·ªìng (also known as H√°t b·ªôi): A theatre form strongly influenced by Chinese opera, it transitioned from being entertainment for the royal court to travelling troupes who performed for commoners and peasants, featuring many well-known stock characters. Traditional dance Vietnam has 54 different ethnics, each with their own traditional dance. Among the ethnic Vietnamese majority, there are several traditional dances performed widely at festivals and other special occasions, such as the lion dance. In the imperial court there also developed throughout the centuries a series of complex court dances which require great skill. Some of the more widely known are the imperial lantern dance, fan dance, and platter dance, among others. Water puppetry Water puppetry theatre in Hanoi Water puppetry is a distinct Vietnamese art which had its origins in the 12th century. In water puppetry, a split-bamboo screen obscures puppets which stand in water and are manipulated using long poles hidden beneath the water. Epic storylines are played out with many different characters, often depicting traditional scenes of Vietnamese life. Despite nearly dying out in the 20th century, it has been saved by efforts of preservation and is now largely seen by tourists to Vietnam. Language arts=Literature Vietnamese literature is literature, both oral and written, created largely by Vietnamese-speaking people, although Francophone Vietnamese and English-speaking Vietnamese authors in Australia and the United States are counted by many critics as part of the national tradition. For much of its history, Vietnam was dominated by China and as a result much of the written work during this period was in Classical Chinese. Ch·ªØ n√¥m, created around the 10th century, allowed writers to compose in Vietnamese using modified Chinese characters. Although regarded as inferior to Chinese, it gradually grew in prestige. It flourished in the 18th century when many notable Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in ch·ªØ n√¥m and when it briefly became the official written script. While the qu·ªëc ng·ªØ script was created in the 17th century, it did not become popular outside of missionary groups until the early 20th century, when the French colonial administration mandated its use in French Indochina. By the mid-20th century, virtually all Vietnamese works of literature were composed in qu·ªëc ng·ªØ. Some defining works of literature include The Tale of Kieu by Nguy·ªÖn Du, and L·ª•c V√¢n Ti√™n by Nguy·ªÖn ƒê√¨nh Chi·ªÉu. Poetry Poet H·ªì Xu√¢n H∆∞∆°ng (born during the end of the 18th century) composed much of her poetry in Ch·ªØ N√¥m, and most of it has been translated into qu·ªëc ng·ªØ for modern Vietnamese. Her poetry continues to be widely popular. Other poets such as the famous Mandarin official Duong Khue had some of his poetry adapted into songs that are still famous today, such as the Ca tr√π-genre song \\"H·ªìng h·ªìng, tuy·∫øt tuy·∫øt\\". Many Vietnamese poems, along with folk \\"literature\\" in general, tends to be much more of an oral tradition - as literacy (as it is defined today) in the past was restricted mostly to scholars and the elite.

In April 2010, he was hired as a creative consultant by the NFB to oversee its animation projects from the Canadian Prairies, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. If I Was God... Barker's fourth film with the NFB is If I Was God..., a 3D film about a 12-year-old boy speculating on what he would do if he was God. The film is inspired by Barker's experiences as a 12-year-old in grade seven, dissecting and experimenting on a frog in biology class, and sensing the approaching power of adulthood after having left the confines of elementary school. Barker intends to experiment with a variety of animation techniques in this film, use stop-motion puppets along with traditional animation and other forms. The film is divided into episodes, with each sequence triggered by mental associations of typical grade seven classroom objects, such as science posters, dioramas and papier-m√¢ch√© volcanoes. The director had initially contemplated also using CGI animation but abandoned the idea out of a desire to achieve an ‚Äúorganic hand-made feel‚Äù for the film. Barker was committed to completing the film with a much shorter production schedule than his previous works, which averaged ‚Äúa disturbing and embarrassing 8¬Ω years per film.‚Äù In November 2015, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that If I Was God... was one of 10 films‚Äîand two NFB productions‚Äîshortlisted for a possible Oscar nomination, however the film didn't receive a nomination.

Born in Liverpool, Walmsley came to Canada with his family in 1952, and was raised in Oshawa, Ontario, and Lorraine, Quebec. He dropped out of high school and battled addictions as a young adult. In addition to his plays, Walmsley was the winner of the first Three-Day Novel Contest in 1979 for his novel Doctor Tin. He later published a sequel, Shades, and another unrelated novel, Kid Stuff. Walmsley wrote the screenplay for Jerry Ciccoritti's film Paris, France in 1993. Ciccoritti also later adapted Walmsley's play Blood into a film. Walmsley's style of writing ranges from the naturalistic to the poetic and, at times, the absurd. He moves easily between dramatic and comedic, and some of his \\"darkest\\" work is treated with a cutting sense of humour. His most common themes include sex (both hetero- and homosexual, often involving sado-masochistic fetishes, adulterous affairs, and, in the case of Blood, incest), violence, addiction (to alcohol and heroin in particular), and God (from a Christian perspective).\\"Finding sobriety and God\\".

Indian agriculture is heavily dependent on the country's climate: a favorable southwest summer monsoon is critical to securing water for irrigating India's crops. In parts of India, failure of the monsoons causes water shortages, resulting in below-average crop yields. This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Gujarat, Telangana, and Rajasthan.  History  In the past, droughts have periodically led to major Indian famines, including the Bengal famine of 1770, in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876-1877 famine, in which over five million people died; and the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5 million died... 1972 Maharashtra drought affected 2.5 crore people. In simple words, drought has destroyed India on a large scale.  Impact of El Ni√±o  All such episodes of severe drought correlate with El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. El Ni√±o-related droughts have also been implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output.. Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean‚Äîin one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to 3 ¬∞C (5 ¬∞F)‚Äîhave resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell that began in the 1990s.. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence center forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts.. The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean influences the degree of drought.

Simmons was proficient in voice, keys and sometimes cello and was known for her use of bedroom, bathroom and kitchen items to sample extra sounds for her recordings. History Simmons began to play piano at the age of three and the cello at the age of eight, dabbling in songwriting along the way. Vocal lessons soon followed and she attended a performing arts school that taught her music technology and performance. She then went on to study at university in both production and songwriting at the Queensland University of Technology.  Early career In 2005, Simmons began recording her self-financed, self-produced seven track debut EP Pendulum but quickly shelved it, thinking it wasn't good enough. She eventually sent a copy to Caroline Tran at Australian radio station Triple J radio who took a liking to its lead single 'Everybody Loves You' and played it a number of times. The song also went on to be a finalist at the Q Song Awards 2006 and selected as a feature song for Triple J OzMusic Month. She eventually realized the EP's potential and it was released in August 2006. Immediately returning to the studio, this time with her cellist Briony Luttrell, Simmons began recording songs for her four track second EP All The Amendments. By the time it was released in February 2007, Simmons had garnered the attention of community and national radio and played as support for My Latest Novel and Home Video. Triple J radio once again played an important part of the promotion of All The Amendments, playing the EP's lead single 'The Recycling Bin Song'. In October 2007, Tara had the 11 tracks from her two previous EPs remastered and repackaged onto a single disc compilation entitled EPilation, a term Tara herself created meaning \\"EP compilation.\\"  Debut album, recognition (2007‚Äì2008) Also in October 2007, Tara began work on songs for her debut album with co-producer Briony Luttrell. Recording in the apartment they share, Tara and Briony began work on a track called 'You And Me', which is commonly referred to as \\"that song with the three cellos\\" when they perform it live. In August 2008, a new song from Tara's recent recording sessions called Shake was nominated for a Q Song Award in the Pop Category. On Valentine's Day 2009, Tara once again sold out the Judith Wright Centre for the launch of her debut album Spilt Milk. She performed the album in its entirety plus \\"Pendulum\\" from her first EP and a cover of They Might Be Giants' song Dr. Worm.  All You Can (2009)  In November 2009, Tara released a brand new EP by the name of All You Can. It was a production collaboration between herself and producer Yanto Browning and spawned two radio singles 'All You Can' and 'I Cannot Be Saved'.  It's Not Like We're Trying To Move Mountains, YesYou (2011‚Äì2012)  Most of 2011 was spent in the studio recording with producer Yanto Browning (The Medics, The Jungle Giants, Kate Miller-Heidke, Art of Sleeping) on some material, originally intended to be released as a collaborative side-project. A new song, presumably from these sessions, emerged on YouTube in August called \\"Honey\\"YouTube, \\"Honey\\" by Tara Simmons, retrieved on 2011-11-15 though it's not indicated if this will be from the forthcoming release. The first official single \\"Be Gone\\" was played on Australia's national youth broadcaster triple j on 11 August 2011 on Zan Rowe's show and it was soon after available on iTunes backed with \\"Honey\\". The second single \\"Where Do You Go\\" debuted on triple j in April on Home & Hosed and was also added to spot rotation. Her second album title It's Not Like We're Trying To Move Mountains was revealed recently during her support slot for Brooklyn's School of Seven Bells in Brisbane. It was released in Australia on 28 September via Inertia. The album contained the previous two singles \\"Be Gone\\" and \\"Where Do You Go\\" and a third was lifted upon the album's release called \\"Weekend of Hearts\\", a song co- written with Dean McGrath of Hungry Kids of Hungary. She embarked on a co- headline tour with Pluto Jonze called \\"From The Mountains to the Sea\\". She also spent much of 2012 touring as the female vocalist for Brisbane-based production duo YesYou whose debut single \\"The Half Of It\\" had experienced some radio success. So far, she has only contributed to one actual recording of the band, a cover of Peter Bjorn and John's song \\"Young Folks\\" released on the Ministry of Sound Uncovered Vol 4 compilation. Her song \\"Be Gone\\" featured in episode six, season six of Gossip Girl called 'Where The Vile Things Are'.

PrabhƒÅkara in his book B·πõhati quotes only Bhart·πõhari (4-5 CE) and Bharavi (5-6 CE). Thus his probable time can be assigned to the latter half of the 6th century. His views on ≈öabara‚Äôs BhƒÅ·π£ya, a commentary on Jaimini‚Äôs P≈´rvamƒ´mƒÅmsƒÅ S≈´tras led to rise of PrƒÅbhƒÅkara school within Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ and further developed as competent philosophical system along with the rival school of KumƒÅrila Bha·π≠·π≠a. The PrƒÅbhƒÅkara school is alleged to be nastika%C4%80stika and n%C4%81stika (atheistic) or CharvakaLokƒÅyata school. > KumƒÅrila said: For in practice the Mimamsa has been for the most part > converted into a Lokayata system; But I have made this effort to bring it > into a theistic path. Here KumƒÅrila refers to Bhartriprapanchahttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Bhartriprapancha, held by somebody as the forerunner of the PrƒÅbhƒÅkara system. It is generally believed that the Mƒ´mƒÅmsakas and specially the PrƒÅbhƒÅkaras are atheists. But the source books of the PrƒÅbhƒÅkara School state in unequivocal terms that the inferential existence of God which is propounded by Naiyayikas and the like is denied by the denied by the PrƒÅbhƒÅkaras and that God is not denied: ‚Äúƒ´≈õvarƒì par≈çktmanumƒÅna·πÅ nirastam, nƒì≈õvar≈ç nirasta·∏•‚Äùhttps://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.328914/page/n6 ≈öƒÅlikanƒÅtha wrote ·πöjuvimalƒÅpa√±cikƒÅ and Dƒ´pa≈õikhƒÅpa√±cikƒÅ commentaries on PrabhƒÅkara in the 8th century. Sentence vs word meaning One of the views of the PrƒÅbhƒÅkaras is that words do not directly designate meaning; any meaning that arises is because it is connected with other words (anvitƒÅbhidhƒÅna, anvita = connected; abhidhƒÅna = denotation). We know or learn the meaning of a word only by considering the sentential context which it appears; we learn such word meanings together with their possible semantic connections with other words. Sentence meanings are grasped directly, from perceptual and contextual cues, skipping the stage of grasping singly the individual word meanings (Matilal 1990:108). This is very similar to the modern view of linguistic underspecification, and relates to the Dynamic Turn in Semantics, which opposes the purely compositional view of arriving at sentence meaning. The PrƒÅbhƒÅkarakas were opposed by the BhƒÅ·π≠·π≠as, who argued for a compositional view of semantics (called abhihitƒÅnvaya). In this view, the meaning of a sentence was understood only after understanding first the meanings of individual words. Words were independent, complete objects, a view that is close to the Fodorian view of language. Of the two principal schools of the P≈´rvamƒ´mƒÅmsƒÅ the Bhatta school has all along attracted greater attention than the Prabhakara school. The study of the works of the Prabhakara school has been neglected for a long time past. All the knowledge that our old Sanskrit scholars had of the tenets of this school was derived solely from the stray references found in the works of the other systems. At the wake of 20th century, Dr. Ganganath Jha has written a very learned thesis in which he has presented in a lucid form the main principles of the Prabhakara school as they have been dealt with in the Prakara·πáapancika of ≈öƒÅlikanƒÅtha.https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.311115/page/n1 He has also given for the first time, much valuable information regarding the B·πõhatƒ´ of PrabhƒÅkara which is a commentary on ≈öabara‚Äôs BhƒÅ·π£ya. Tradition and research Tradition makes PrabhƒÅkara a pupil of KumƒÅrila who nicknamed him as Guru on account of his great intellectual powers. But some scholars like Dr. Ganganatha Jha believe that the PrƒÅbhƒÅkara School is older and seems to be nearer to the spirit of the original Mƒ´mƒÅmsƒÅ. Dr. Keith (Karmamimamsa, 1921), who likewise rejects the current view in regard to the synchronism of the two authors and their mutual relation, assigns PrabhƒÅkara to 600-650 A.D. (Gopinath Kaviraj in Jha's Tantravarttika, 1924)https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.282920/page/n18 According to the view of Dr. Ganganath Jha, the PrabhƒÅkara is more faithful to the BhƒÅ·π£ya of ≈öabara than KumƒÅrila. Also, according to Professor M. Hiriyanna, the original teaching of the Mƒ´mƒÅmsa is better preserved in the writings of PrabhƒÅkara than in those of KumƒÅrila. As rightly observed by Dr. G. P. BhattJaini, P. (1964). Govardhan P. Bhatt: Epistemology of the BhƒÅ·π≠·π≠a school of P≈´rva-mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ. (The Chowkhamba Sanskrit Studies, Vol. XVII.)

In order to understand the system of Mƒ´mƒÅmsa fully and precisely, one must go through the works of the Prabhakara system. Pt. S. Subrahmanya SƒÅstri maintains the view that though many theories of this system are criticized in other systems particularly in the Nyaya the PrƒÅbhƒÅkara school commands respect from and is actually made use of by reputed scholars.https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/64253 The Vi≈õi·π£·π≠ƒÅdvaita School of philosophy follows the PrƒÅbhƒÅkara School in matters regarding the categories of the world. It may be said that the study of the PrƒÅbhƒÅkara Mƒ´mƒÅmsa is necessary for acquiring a clear knowledge of the Dharma ≈öƒÅstras and the SƒÅya·πáabhƒÅ·π£ya of the Vedas as well. Flawless Logic from Mƒ´mƒÅmsa rules There is an old dispute about the \\"≈öyena sacrifice\\", a sacrifice in the Vedas meant to kill one's enemies. How can this be reconciled with the rule not to harm any living being? As Agata Ciabattoni says: \\"For a Hindu, the Vedas are absolutely correct, so there cannot be any contradiction\\". PrabhƒÅkara resolved this problem by applying several rules from the Vedas in a logically rather complicated way. Various scholars did not believe that his reasoning was correct, and this dispute has been going on for centuries. Agata Ciabattoni and her team closely collaborated with Sanskritists to translate the Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ rules and the Vedic laws into mathematical formulae ‚Äì and they could prove that PrabhƒÅkara had been right all along. Given the prescriptions of the Vedas, PrabhƒÅkara's logic was flawless, thus settling an old philosophical dispute with Mathematical logic.

More recently, molecular phylogenetic publications grouped it within the clade \\"Euasterids I\\", and most recently, it was demoted to a subfamily of the family Boraginaceae in the APG II system. This subfamily has a disjunct distribution, occurring in Colombia as well as a separate area in southwestern North America, covering parts of California, Arizona and Mexico. It consists of up to three genera, Ammobroma, Lennoa and Pholisma, which among them hold around five species, including the desert Christmas tree, Pholisma arenarium, and sandfood, Pholisma sonorae. Members of this subfamily are succulent, herbaceous plants with no chlorophyll. The leaves are reduced to short scales, and the plants are entirely parasitic on the roots of their hosts, which are typically Clematis, Euphorbia or various woody Asteraceae.

He has been a close collaborator of the architect Christopher Alexander, with whom Salingaros shares a harsh critical analysis of conventional modern architecture. Like Alexander, Salingaros has proposed an alternative theoretical approach to architecture and urbanism that is more adaptive to human needs and aspirations, and that combines rigorous scientific analysis with deep intuitive experience. Salingaros published substantive research on Algebras, Mathematical Physics, Electromagnetic Fields, and Thermonuclear Fusion before turning his attention to Architecture and Urbanism. Salingaros still teaches mathematics, and is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Texas at San Antonio. He is also on the Architecture faculties of universities in Italy, Mexico, and The Netherlands. Personal Born to Greek parents, Salingaros is the only child of the popular composer Stelios Salingaros; he is also the nephew of the operatic baritone Spyros Sali(n)garosSpyros Saligaros's website (). Education Salingaros began working in the arts as a painter, but soon switched to the sciences. He obtained a bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Miami, Florida. He took his Master‚Äôs in 1974 and Doctorate in 1978 at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. In 1982, he started a long-term collaboration with Christopher Alexander, becoming one of the editors of The Nature of Order, Alexander‚Äôs four-volume masterwork on aesthetics and the geometric processes of nature. Career Salingaros joined the Mathematics faculty of the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1983, where he remains today. In the 1990s, Salingaros began to publish his own research on architectural and urban form. In 1997 he was recipient of the first award ever by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for research on architectural topics. In 2003, he was elected to the Committee of Honor, International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture & Urbanism (INTBAU), and to the INTBAU College of Traditional Practitioners. Writings Salingaros' writings helped to introduce two key concepts in urban morphology, fractals and networks. His book Principles of Urban Structure has been compared to that of Michael Batty (United Kingdom) and Pierre Frankhauser (France) in describing cities as giant fractals, and the separate efforts of Paul Drewe (Holland) and Gabriel Dupuy (France) in describing cities as giant networks. His work links urban form to new concepts such as the Small-world network and the Scale-free network. Michael Batty, Bartlett Professor of Planning at University College London, wrote about Salingaros' contribution: \\"He shows how networks which evolve from the bottom up lead to ordered (scaled) hierarchies that are both efficient and well adjusted. ‚Ä¶ This is the theory of the small world, but contained within, there is the germ of an idea which has barely been exploited. In connecting elements in cities, there is a natural ordering from many short links which aggregate to a lesser number of longer links which, in my view, could be linked to small worlds, to scale-free networks, to power law distributions and, more significantly, to changes in transportation technology. Salingaros is the first to hint at this.\\" Ref.Michael Batty, Review of Principles of Urban Structure by Nikos A. Salingaros, Journal of Urban Design, Vol. 11, No. 1 (2006), pages 141-143 A Theory of Architecture, a collection of previously published papers, describes a set of guidelines for design, giving scientific principles that link forms to human sensibilities. In it he describes a practical architectural system in a form that any practicing architect can use. The work incorporates Salingaros‚Äô observations of the greatest buildings of the past, which he defines as those that are the most responsive to human sensibilities. While this method and its theoretical underpinning support traditional architectural typologies, Salingaros emphasizes that architects should be free to adapt their ideas to particular situations, leaving decisions to be influenced by the environment and needs of the project. He explores questions such as: How can ornament be justified, and why is it necessary? What are the ratios and hierarchies that promote neighborliness and beauty? What is it about our biological nature ‚Äî perhaps even about the nature of matter itself ‚Äî that makes us feel one thing in the presence of one kind of structure and something else in the presence of another? Speaking as a mathematician, he proposes a theoretical framework to answer these questions. Anti-Architecture and Deconstruction is a collection of essays written as a polemic against contemporary \\"star\\" architecture, and its supporters within architectural academia and the architectural media. It is an impassioned indictment against the \\"bad architecture\\" that he argues has been promoted by their actions. Salingaros defines \\"bad architecture\\" as that which makes people uncomfortable or physically ill, and which pursues formal or ideological concerns instead of adapting to nature and to the needs of ordinary human beings. \\"Social Housing in Latin America: A Methodology to Utilize Processes of Self-Organization\\", by Nikos Salingaros, David Brain, Andres Duany, Michael Mehaffy & Ernesto Philibert, outlined the role of socio-spatial relations in guaranteeing a successful built environment. \\"Favelas and Social Housing: The Urbanism of Self-Organization\\" The principal urbanist problem facing the world today concerns the socio-political processes in the planning and construction of social housing, as well as the large-scale renovation of favelas. This paper identified urban space that is loved by its inhabitants, enough to be defended against encroachment and degradation, as a crucial concept. The criterion is an emotional one, and arises from the correct satisfaction of the residents' emotional needs through the appropriate urban morphology, which is in turn created only through user participation (in a bottom-up process guided by an NGO representative). This successful type of urban space rarely arises from the typologies of post-war planning.Favelas page on AboutUs Wiki Salingaros‚Äô newer writings focus on biophilia as an essential component of the design of the human environment, thus joining the ideas of Edward Osborne Wilson to Sustainable design. Influence=Architecture Salingaros has had a significant theoretical influence on several major figures in architecture. Christopher Alexander, author of the seminal treatises A Pattern Language and Notes on the Synthesis of Form, describes Salingaros' influence: \\"In my view, the second person who began to explore the deep connection between science and architecture was Nikos Salingaros, one of the four Katarxis editors. He had been working with me helping me edit material in The Nature of Order, for years, and at some point‚Äîin the mid-nineties I think‚Äîbegan writing papers looking at architectural problems in a scientific way. Then by the second half of the nineties he began making important contributions to the building of this bridge, and to scientific explorations in architecture which constituted a bridge.\\" Christopher Alexander, \\"The Interaction of Architecture and Science\\" Prince Charles, an influential critic of contemporary architecture, expressed Salingaros' influence in his own preface to Salingaros‚Äô A Theory of Architecture: \\"Surely no voice is more thought-provoking than that of this intriguing, perhaps historically important, new thinker?\\" Preface to Nikos Salingaros, \\"A Theory of Architecture\\", (Solingen, Umbau-Verlag, 2006), page 9 Tall buildings The End of Tall Buildings (2001), co-authored with James Kunstler,The End of Tall Buildings argued that the age of skyscrapers is at an end, and that 9/11 marks the beginning of the end of modernist typologies dominating urban form. While the world has not stopped building skyscrapers, this became one of the most cited and controversial essays on the topic. Referring to this essay, Benjamin Forgey of The Washington Post said: \\"What many are feeling today goes right to the marrow: the fear of being a target. And who today can deny that tall buildings such as the World Trade Center towers make ideal targets?\\" Benjamin Forgey, \\"Reach For the Sky\\" Urbanism Salingaros contributed to the New Athens Charter of 2003, which is meant to replace the original 1933 Athens Charter written principally by the highly influential modernist architect-planner Le Corbusier. That blueprint segregated urban functions and contributed to generating post-war urban typologies such as monoculture and sprawl. Through this and other writings Salingaros sought to retrofit suburbia, and reconnect US and European cities at the human scale. This work can be seen as allied with the New Urbanism movement to replace sprawling development with compact, walkable cities and towns. Salingaros is involved in forming a community that applies analogous techniques of File sharing and Open-source software from computer science to urbanism. This movement, based upon Peer-to-peer principles, is aptly called P2P Urbanism, and combines user participation in design and the use of Design Patterns from Christopher Alexander with other methods found useful in handling complex software. A description, definition, and recent articles are published on the website of the Foundation for Peer to Peer Alternatives. Computer science Salingaros has never written a true software paper, yet two of his papers are quoted by the CS community. Both these papers were later included as chapters in the book Principles of Urban Structure. The Structure of Pattern Languages (2000)The Structure of Pattern Languages argues that patterns (a concept central to the design pattern movement in CS and introduced by Alexander) encapsulate information about recurring design solutions and human activities. Techniques for linking observed patterns validate a Pattern language, and dismiss stylistic rules and antipatterns as arbitrary. E. Todd, E. Kemp and C. Phillips commented: \\"Salingaros shows that a loose collection of patterns is not a system, because it lacks connections, implying that the quality and nature of the connections between patterns is what determines whether a collection is a language or not. He identifies two forms of connectivity when discussing pattern languages: external connectivity and internal connectivity. These two forms of connection are central to validating a pattern language. Salingaros implies that the richness of connections between levels and within levels in a pattern language is a factor in determining a language‚Äôs internal validity.\\" E. Todd, E. Kemp & C. Phillips, \\"What makes a good user interface pattern language?\\" The Information Architecture of Cities (co-authored with L. Andrew Coward, 2004) Ref.The Information Architecture of Cities describes cities as systems of informational architecture, in which high-level functionality separates the system into communicating modules. Information exchange in urban systems includes visual input from the environment, personal contact, telecommunications, and the movement of people. Journeys by residents through a city accomplish a primary information exchange (the interaction that is the intent of the journey). But ideally, journeys have secondary, serendipitous information exchange. For example, a pedestrian on the way to work visits shops, sees advertisements, buys a newspaper, encounters a friend and has a quick word. The virtue of cities is this dense, fractal, multilayered information exchange. It is closely related to the generation of economic wealth and culture within cities. In \\"The Information Architecture of Cities\\" Salingaros also defined the useful notion of \\"fractal loading\\", later picked up by Richard Veryard,\\"Fractal Loading\\". Richard Veryard, Friday, 18 June 2004. Phil Jones,Phil Jones, \\"Markets are Conversations\\"Phil Jones, \\"City as Information Processing Architecture\\" and others in Computer Science. Complexity Salingaros introduced a model of Complexity by using an analogy with thermodynamic quantities in physics, later developed in collaboration with the Computer Scientist Allen Klinger. This work adopted the notion of Herbert A. Simon that what is important is the organization of complexity, and it proposed a simple means to measure it. Christopher Alexander discussed Salingaros‚Äô model in Book 1 of The Nature of Order: \\"I believe it is important to show this result simply to underline the fact that living structure is, in principle, susceptible to mathematical treatment, and may therefore be regarded as a part of physics.\\" Philosophy Salingaros has been a harsh critic of deconstructivism in architecture, and its uncritical application of the philosophy of post-structuralism. His essay \\"The Derrida Virus\\" \\"The Derrida Virus\\" argues that the ideas of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida, applied in an uncritical way, effectively form an information \\"virus\\" that dismantles logical thought and knowledge. Salingaros employs the meme model earlier introduced by Richard Dawkins to explain the transmission of ideas. In so doing he provides a model that validates earlier claims by philosopher Richard Wolin that Derrida‚Äôs philosophy is logically nihilistic. Even though Salingaros uses Dawkins‚Äô ideas, he nevertheless strongly disagrees with Dawkins‚Äô evaluation of religion as just another meme, as expounded in Dawkins‚Äô book The God Delusion. Supporting Alexander‚Äôs most recent work tying religion to geometry, Salingaros argues for the important historic contribution of religious tradition to human understanding, both in architecture and in philosophy. General Salingaros has been included in \\"50 VISIONARIES who are changing your world\\", published in the November‚ÄìDecember 2008 edition of Utne Reader. This is the first follow-up of the 2001 Utne Reader book \\"(65) VISIONARIES: people and ideas to change your life\\", which included Jane Jacobs, Andr√©s Duany, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, Muhammad Yunus, Fritjof Capra, Edward Goldsmith, and William McDonough.

Previous events had had long qualifying cycles, spread over more than a year, culminating in a long match (best of 20 or 24 games) between the incumbent champion and a challenger. From 1998 to 2004, however, FIDE organised its World Championship as a single event over about a month, with many players playing short knockout matches, rather in the style of a tennis tournament such as Wimbledon. Background From 1948 to 1993, the world chess championship had been administered by FIDE, the international chess federation. In 1993, the World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov split from FIDE and formed a rival organisation, the Professional Chess Association. FIDE stripped Kasparov of his title, meaning there were now two rival championships: the FIDE title, held by Anatoly Karpov, and the PCA title, held by Kasparov. Karpov and Kasparov had successfully defended their titles at the FIDE World Chess Championship 1996 and PCA World Chess Championship 1995 respectively. From 1948 until 1996, World Chess Championships had followed a similar pattern: a series of qualifying tournaments and matches were held over more than a year, culminating in the Candidates Tournament. The winner of the Candidates tournament was the official challenger for the world title and would play the incumbent champion in a match for the world championship. (The 1996 cycle was an exception. The incumbent world champion participated in the Candidates tournament as a seeded semi-finalist.) In 1997, FIDE president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov proposed a completely new structure: a knockout tournament, consisting of two game matches (slightly longer in the final rounds), with match tie-breakers using rapid chess and blitz chess if necessary. This format had been done before in tournaments, but never at the world championship level. Controversies The advantages of the new format were: * It avoided a long cycle and was all over in a month or so. This is could all be done in the one venue, it would not have the scheduling problems which had beset some previous world championship cycles. Each round could be played in 3 days (one day for each normal time control game, and one for the tie breaks). * More players (up to 128) could be included. * There were no special privileges for the incumbent champion or seeded players (although some were preserved in the earlier championships, these were completely eliminated later on). Opponents pointed out the disadvantages of the format: * Short matches (only two games in the earlier rounds) left too much to chance - the stronger player could blunder a game, and it would be difficult to recover from a bad start. (Many world championship and Candidates matches had been won by the player who recovered from an early loss). * The rapid playoffs were also seen to be left too much to chance: strength in rapid chess is not the same as strength in chess with normal time controls. * These first two considerations, taken together, meant there was a very high chance that the best player would not win, or even that a complete outsider might win, opponents argued. * Some people felt that the tradition of the champion being seeded into the final should be preserved so that a new champion can only be champion by defeating the old champion. Prominent non-participants * Kasparov, holder of the rival PCA/Classical World title until 2000, did not recognise the FIDE title and did not play in any of five events. * Likewise Vladimir Kramnik, after winning Kasparov's title in 2000, did not play in the FIDE events after 2000. * In 1997-98, Kramnik declined for a different reason, in protest against Karpov being seeded into the final. * In 1999 Karpov declined to play because the FIDE champion had always been seeded into the final or semi-final, but he was required to enter at the second round. Karpov didn't play in subsequent events either, but by then he was semi-retired from top-level chess. * In 1999, Anand did not play because he was expecting to play a match against Kasparov for the Classical World Chess Championship 2000 - a match which did not eventuate.Opening Ceremony for Wijk aan Zee, The Week in Chess, Special Report, 14-Jan-2000 * A number of players refused to play in 2004 due to it being in Libya. See FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 Time control controversy For the 2002 and 2004 events, FIDE used a faster time control, which was criticised by Kasparov for lowering the standard of the games.The Week in Chess 377 - 29 January 2002 Low rated winnersLocation of 2004 event The 2004 event had extra controversy due to it being played in Libya. See FIDE World Chess Championship 2004. History=FIDE World Chess Championship 1998 The first knockout tournament was held at the end of 1997. In addition to the new format, it was proposed by Ilyumzhinov as a way to unify the two rival world titles. To do this, FIDE champion Karpov and PCA champion Kasparov were each to be seeded into the semi-finals. Kasparov did not want to defend his title under these circumstances and declined his invitation. The format was then modified to have FIDE champion Karpov seeded directly into the final. All of the tournament except the final was held in Groningen in December 1997. There were seven rounds. There were a few less than 128 players, with some players seeded into the second round. The first six rounds consisted of two normal time control games, plus tiebreaks. The seventh-round (the semi-final) consisted of four normal time control games, plus tiebreaks. The semi-final was between Viswanathan Anand and Michael Adams, and was won by Anand.World Chess Championship 1997 FIDE Knockout Matches, Mark Weeks' Chess Pages Anand then played Karpov in the final in January 1998. The final was best of 6 normal time control games, and this was drawn 3-3. Karpov then won the rapid playoff, becoming the 1998 FIDE World Chess Champion.World Chess Championship 1998 Karpov - Anand FIDE Title Match, Mark Weeks' Chess Pages There were criticisms that Anand never really had a chance because Karpov was much fresher than Anand, who had only three days between his match with Adams and the match with Karpov, while Karpov automatically qualified for the final. FIDE World Chess Championship 1999 The 1999 tournament was held in Las Vegas, in July and August 1999. Karpov was not seeded into the final and refused to participate. Kasparov again refused to take part, and famously said that most of the participants were \\"tourists\\".The Week in Chess 249 - 16 August 1999 The event was won by Alexander Khalifman.World Chess Championship 1999 FIDE Knockout Matches, Mark Weeks' Chess Pages Khalifman was rated 44th in the world at the time,The Week in Chess 243 - 5 July 1999 which some compared unfavourably to PCA champion Kasparov being rated #1.

However, FIDE still held a 2005 knockout tournament called the \\"FIDE World Cup\\", as the first stage of qualification for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2007. It roughly fills the place of the old Interzonal tournaments, with the top 10 placegetters qualifying for the 2007 Candidates Tournament. Aftermath The world championship was eventually reunified in 2006, when classical champion Vladimir Kramnik (who had defeated Garry Kasparov in 2000) defeated the winner of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005, Veselin Topalov. Since then the championship has been decided, as before, in a final match between the defending champion and a challenger decided by the Candidates Tournament.

Early life He was born into a working class Jewish immigrant family in Brooklyn, New York. His parents originally came from Lithuania and Hungary. He was also a member of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. He became active in the Young Communist League on returning to Brooklyn after the CCC. It was there that he volunteered to go to Spain to fight fascism. Spanish Civil War In early 1937, Wolff set off to join the International Brigades in Spain, reaching Albacete by March. As a pacifist, a belief common in the 1930s, he originally wished to be a medic. However, after the International Brigades' heavy losses at the Battle of Jarama, he became a soldier instead, joining a machine gun company. \\"Largely self-educated, ... [he] was an intellectual\\".Eby, p. 319 He \\"detested elegant uniforms\\", customarily wearing \\"baggy trousers, a stained leather jacket\\" and, in wet weather, a \\"woolly poncho\\". After a year's fighting in Brunete, Belchite and Teruel, the Brigade lost two senior officers, David Doran and Robert Hale Merriman at the Gandesa battle on the Aragon front. After which, in March 1938, Wolff became the battalion commander. He led the now Lincoln-Washington Battalion during the Battle of the Ebro and left Spain in November 1938 when the International Brigades were demobilized. Ernest Hemingway described him during this period: [he was] \\"...23 years old, tall as Lincoln, gaunt as Lincoln, and as brave and as good a soldier as any that commanded battalions at Gettysburg. He is alive and unhit by the same hazard that leaves one tall palm tree standing where a hurricane has passed.\\"Notes by Hemingway on \\"Major Milton Wolff\\", in Davidson (1939). World War II In 1940, Wolff volunteered for the British Special Operations Executive, and arranged arms for the European resistance organizations. After the United States' entry into World War II, Wolff volunteered for the infantry in June 1942. He saw action at the end of 1943 in Burma. There, General \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan met him and assigned him to the O.S.S. to work with anti-fascist partisans in occupied Italy. Later life Wolff appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee to defend VALB (Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) from being banned as a Communist front organization. His explanation for his actions owed to his ancestry: \\"I am Jewish, and knowing that as a Jew we are the first to suffer when fascism does come, I went to Spain to fight against it.\\"Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (2008) According to historian Peter Carroll: > When Congress passed the McCarran Act in 1950, obliging all designated > subversive organizations to register with the federal government and > creating heavy penalties for leaders who refused to cooperate, the entire > executive committee of the VALB resigned in 1950. In its place, two Lincoln > veterans stepped forward: Wolff became the National Commander; Moe Fishman > became the Executive Secretary/Treasurer and served the organization in an > executive capacity for the rest of his life. Wolff also battled fiercely for civil rights and against the Vietnam War. He even offered the services of the aging veterans of the Lincoln Brigade to the North Vietnamese leader, Ho Chi Minh, who declined them. Later, Wolff campaigned against apartheid in South Africa, and raised money for ambulances in Sandinista-ruled Nicaragua in the 1980s, personally delivering twenty of them. Wolff completed two autobiographical novels, A Member Of The Working Class (published 2005) about his early life in New York, and Another Hill (published 1994) about his communist and Spanish experiences; he began a third book, The Premature Anti-Fascist, describing his experiences after leaving Spain and during World War II, but did not finish it before his death.

Aedemon was a loyal former household slave to the client King Ptolemy of Mauretania, who was the son of King Juba II and the Ptolemaic Princess Cleopatra Selene II. Ptolemy was murdered in unknown circumstances while on a visit in Rome on order of his unstable second cousin, the Roman Emperor Caligula in late 40\\\\. From loyalty and memory of his former master, Aedemon wanted to avenge Ptolemy and started the revolt in the Kingdom of Mauretania against Rome. Few people from the kingdom joined in the revolt, however. One inscription from Volubilis, a major town of the kingdom, shows that at least a significant part of the town's population fought against Aedemon. The power vacuum created an opportunity for indigenous tribes to assume independence. Consequently, the Roman annexation implied the reassurance of tribal allegiance by fighting tribal chiefs like Sabalus. By then, Caligula had been murdered on January 24, 41 and his paternal uncle Claudius had become the new emperor. It is unsure whether M. Licinius Crassus Frugi had been sent to Mauretania before, but Pliny relates that the Roman Generals Gaius Suetonius Paulinus and Gnaeus Hosidius Geta were appointed by Emperor Claudius in 42 to fill the power vacuum, reinstate central power and subjugate rebellious nomadic tribes. Paulinus became the first Roman to cross the Atlas Mountains during the campaign. Tingi, modern Tangier, was partially destroyed during the battles against the Romans. The revolt ended in 44, after a decisive battle in which the Romans inflicted large casualties on the Berbers and offered terms to the survivors, Sabalus and his troops subsequently surrendered to Geta. The fate of Aedemon is unknown. Claudius decided to divide the kingdom into two Roman provinces, Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis, while Tingi was later rebuilt.

Pl. 2: 1061. 1753. Flora of China, Áä¨ÈóÆËçÜ quan wen jing Equisetum palustre Linnaeus  Description  Equisetum palustre is a perennial cryptophyte, growing between 10 and 50 centimeters (4\\" to 20\\"), in rare cases up to one meter (3'). Its fertile shoots, which carry ears, are evergreen and shaped like the sterile shoots. The rough, furrowed stem is one to three mm in diameter with usually eight to ten ribs, in rare cases, four to 12. It contains whorled branches. The tight- fitting sheaths end in four to 12 teeth. The lower sheaths are dark brown and much shorter than the sheaths of the main shoot. The central and vallecular canals are about the same size, but the carinal channels are much smaller. The central channels measure about one sixth of the diameter of the stem. The spores are spread by the wind (anemochory) and have four long ribbon-like structures attached to them. They sit on strobili which are rounded on the top. Marsh Horsetails often form subterranean runners and tubers, with which they also can proliferate vegetatively.  Ecology  Equisetum palustre is green from spring to autumn and grows spores from June to September. It grows primarily in nutrient-rich wet meadows. It is found in Europe and the circumpolar region up to mountainous heights. Its distribution is declining. A specific plant association in which E. palustre is found is the Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre fen-meadow.C. Michael Hogan. 2009  Toxicity  Equisetum palustre is poisonous to herbivorous animals, but not to humans. It contains a vitamin B1-destroying enzyme which can lead to severe lack of coordination in horses, and the piperidine alkaloid palustrine, which leads to lameness in cattle. Both substances are stable for years. References * Flora of North America: Equisetum palustre * C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Marsh Thistle: Cirsium palustre, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N.

The jet forms as a response to a convective circulation having upshear tilt and horizontal pressure gradients. The cold pool that comes from the outflow of a storm forms an area of high pressure at the surface. In response to the surface high and warmer temperatures aloft due to convection, a mid-level mesolow forms behind the leading edge of the storm. With a mid-level area of low pressure, air is drawn in under the trailing stratiform region of precipitation. As air is drawn in on the rear side of the storm, it begins to descend as it approaches the front line of the cells. Before reaching the leading edge, the jet descends to the surface as a strong downdraft, creating straight-line winds. Any mature mesoscale convective system is capable of developing its own rear- inflow jet, but questions remain as to what influences the strength of the jet. While the diabatic effects of sublimation, melting and evaporation play a role in influencing jet strength, these effects do not account for cases with strong rear-inflow jets. However, the diabatic effects are responsible for the jet subsiding behind the leading edge of the MCS. The sinking of the jet first starts when the mid level inflow goes under the trailing stratiform cloud before descending to the melting layer. There are other factors that contribute to the strength of any rear inflow jet. The strength of a rear inflow jet can be greatly increased with induced vortices at the end of the line, called \\"line-end vortices\\" or \\"book-end vortices.\\" These vortices at either end of the line will help reinforce the rear inflow towards the center of the line. The other factor that can help strengthen the jet is an environment in which the large scale flow is feeding/forcing mid-level air into the rear end of the storm.

It began publication in 1866 as a private publication but by the late 1860s served as the de facto publication of the LDS Church's auxiliary Deseret Sunday School Union. It was an official periodical of the LDS Church from 1901 to 1929, after which the Church replaced it with The Instructor. History The Juvenile Instructor was issued monthly and was initially targeted toward the children and youth members of the LDS Church. It consisted of catechisms on the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants; musical compositions; illustrations; stories; editorial teachings; and other aids to gospel instruction. It was the first magazine for children published in the United States west of the Mississippi River. For much of its history, The Juvenile Instructor was owned by the Cannon family. Its first editor was George Q. Cannon, an apostle in the LDS Church. Cannon and his family continued to publish the magazine privately until January 1, 1901, when the Deseret Sunday School Union purchased the magazine and continued its publication as its official organ. Between 1901 and 1929, the magazine was considered the official publication of the church's Sunday School. Between 1881 and 1890, George Reynolds was an assistant editor of The Juvenile Instructor. In 1882, he wrote a series of popular articles in the magazine about Joseph Smith and the translation of the Book of Mormon.

SEE's take on alternative education includes small class sizes, discussion-based courses, thematic English courses, and opportunities for independent and project-based learning. SEE delivers all courses required for the completion of the Ontario Secondary School Diploma. It offers opportunities to participate in media, technology, and photography courses, with equipment such as cameras, two computer labs, recording equipment and a dark room available for student use. SEE has a full curriculum that includes the arts, math, humanities and sciences, as well as physical education, technology and business. SEE is a semestered school.  Curriculum  Because SEE has a small student population, the range of courses offered each term is limited. However, the small class sizes (usually 20 or fewer students per class) enable a greater breadth and depth within each individual course, which is not usually possible in normal class sizes of 30 or more. Because of the informal teaching environment and low student to teacher ratio, students are encouraged to learn independently, through discussions, and through projects, often of their own design. Many courses at SEE are thematic. Past English classes have had themes of Death & Dying, Classics, Queer, Graphic Novel, and Science Fiction. A Writer's Craft course is also offered. Themed history courses have included Genocide, Power and Protest, and Revolution. A History of Food course was offered in the 2012-13 school year. Although SEE offers the same credit as other schools, the classes generally have different names than most schools. For example, the grade 9-10 English class for 08-09 was named \\"Stop The Madness\\"; there have been grade 10 and 11 Tech courses called \\"Schnitzel\\" and \\"Tattoo\\"; and the Physical Education class is known as \\"Healthy Living\\".  Admission process  Because SEE is an optional attendance school, potential students must go through an application process in order to be admitted. This process includes an application (including an essay), an interview, and submission of a transcript (if the student has previously attended a secondary school) or a report card (if the student is applying directly from grade eight).

Hundreds of rabbinical students participate in Passover and summer visitation programs, building Jewish awareness and spreading Torah knowledge. To date, the program has sent students to more than 150 countries. The Rabbinical Student Visitation Program began in 1943, when Rabbi Schneerson dispatched the first pairs of students to ten cities in Upstate New York. Cities in California were added to the program in 1944, as were cities in the Southern United States in 1945. By 1948, the summer program numbered 20 students and 100 American cities. Students were also sent to Jewish farmers residing throughout the Northeastern United States, many of whom were European immigrants. The students were sent in pairs, usually one American student and one European-immigrant student. In the early 1950s, the Rebbe added international destinations to the summer program, personally consulting maps and planning the itineraries. Currently, 400 Roving Rabbis participate in the annual summer program. They distribute thousands of mezuzot, other religious articles such as tefillin and kosher food, and tens of thousands of Jewish information packets each year. The students interact with both individuals and families. They often go door to door, teaching women how to light Shabbat candles and showing men how to put on tefillin for the first time. They speak about Jewish education, answer questions, and give bar mitzvah lessons. Their visits are often anticipated by the local population. On their 2010 swing through the islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Cura√ßao, for example, the two Roving Rabbis were summoned to the office of Aruba Prime Minister Mike Eman, who is Jewish. Eman spoke with them about Jewish heritage, listened as they blew the shofar (it was the Hebrew month of Elul, when the shofar is blown daily in synagogues), and donned a pair of tefillin. After completing their visit to the islands, the students returned to the Prime Minister's office so he could put on tefillin again, and he asked them to arrange for him to have his own pair of tefillin.Marks, Yehudah.

According to John W. Garver, Chinese perceptions about the Indian designs for Tibet, and the failure to demarcate a common border between China and India (including the Indian Forward Policy) were important in China's decision to fight a war with India. Friendly relations Numerous changes occurred in the late 1940s, with the independence of the Republic of India and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1947, and the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. One of the most basic policies for the Indian government was that of maintaining cordial relations with China. The Indian government wished to revive its ancient friendly ties with China. When the PRC was declared, India was among the first countries to give it diplomatic recognition. After Nehru coming to power, the PRC announced that its army would be occupying Tibet. India sent a letter of protest to China proposing negotiations on the Tibet issue.Mohan Guruswamy, Mohan, \\"The Great India-China Game\\", Rediff, 23 June 2003. The newly formed PRC was more active in posting troops to the Aksai Chin border than the newly formed Indian republic was. India decided to take moves to ensure a stable Indo-Chinese border. In August 1950, China expressed its gratitude to India's attempts to \\"stabilize the Indo-Chinese border\\". To clear any doubts or ambiguities, Prime Minister Nehru stated in Parliament in 1950 that \\"Our maps show that the McMahon Line is our boundary and that is our boundary...we stand by that boundary and we will not let anyone else come across that boundary\\". China expressed no concerns at these statements. By 1951, China had extended numerous posts in Aksai Chin. The Indian government, on the other hand, concentrated its military efforts on stopping Ladakh from being taken by Pakistani troops and did not establish itself in Aksai Chin.VK Singh resolving the boundary dispute On various occasions in 1951 and 1952, however, the government of China expressed the idea that there were no frontier issues between India and Chinese Tibet to be worried about. Later, in September 1951, India declined to attend a conference in San Francisco for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan because China, which India viewed as an important factor in this treaty, was not invited because of its status as an international pariah. In the coming years India strove to become China's representative in world matters, as China had been isolated from many issues. India vigorously pressed, since the start of the 1950s, for the PRC to be included within the UN. The People's Liberation Army defeated the Tibetan army in a battle at Chamdo in 1950 and Lhasa recognized Chinese sovereignty over Tibet in 1951. The Indian army asserted control of Tawang at this time, overcoming some armed resistance and expelling its Tibetan administrators. In 1954, China and India concluded the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence under which India acknowledged Chinese sovereignty in Tibet. Indian negotiators presented a frontier map to the Chinese that included the McMahon Line and the Chinese side did not object. At this time, the Indian government under Prime Minister Nehru promoted the slogan Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai (India and China are brothers). On 1 July 1954 Nehru wrote a memo directing that the maps of India be revised to show definite boundaries on all frontiers, where they were previously indicated as undemarcated.A.G. Noorani, \\"Fact of History\\" , India's National Magazine, 30 September 2003. The new maps also revised the boundary in the east to show the Himalayan hill crest as the boundary. In some places, this line is a few kilometres north of the McMahon Line.A.G. Noorani, \\"Perseverance in peace process\\" , India's National Magazine, 29 August 2003. Beginning in 1956, the CIA used Indian territory to recruit Tibetan guerrillas to fight Chinese troops, with a base in Kalimpong, India.Kenneth Conboy and James Morrison, \\"The CIA's Secret War in Tibet\\", University Press of Kansas, 2002, pp. 96-97 The Indian public was outraged when it learned in 1958 that China had built a road between Xinjiang and Tibet through Indian territory in Aksai Chin (historically a part of Indian state of Ladakh). In 1956, Nehru expressed concern to Zhou Enlai that Chinese maps showed some 120,000 square kilometres of Indian territory as Chinese. Zhou responded that there were errors in the maps and that they were of little meaning. He stated that the maps needed revising from previous years where such ideas were considered to be true. In November 1956, Zhou again repeated his assurances that he had no claims based on the maps. Tibet disagreements According to John W. Garver, Nehru's policy on Tibet was to create a strong Sino-Indian partnership which would be catalyzed through agreement and compromise on Tibet. Garver believes that Nehru's previous actions (befriending China on such issues as war in Korea, the PRC's U.N. admission, the peace treaty with Japan and transfer of Taiwan to the PRC, Indochina, and decolonization and the Afro-Asian movement) had given Nehru a confidence that China would be ready to form an \\"Asian Axis\\" with India. Much misunderstanding between the two nations led to diplomatic spats over Tibet, with Nehru's move to accommodate the Dalai Lama overshadowing his other actions and opinions on Tibet, including the opinion that an armed resistance movement in Tibet would be suicidal and counterproductive. While China treated India's concerns with Tibet as expansionist, some in India claim that its concerns were in fact sentimental and culturally-linked, as Buddhist Tibet had been under influence of Indian culture for many years. Top PRC leader Mao Zedong was humiliated by the reception the Dalai Lama obtained in India when he fled there in March 1959. The Tibet disagreements heightened in the Chinese media, with Mao himself asking Xinhua News Agency on 19 April to produce commentary on unknown Indian expansionists operating in Tibet. Mao decided on 25 April to openly criticize Nehru for his Tibet policy: Tensions steadily increased between the two nations when Mao implied that the Lhasa rebellion in Tibet was caused by Indians. On 6 May 1959, Mao published \\"The Revolution in Tibet and Nehru's Philosophy\\" where he accused Nehru of openly encouraging Tibetan rebels. This publication was evident of China's perception of India as a threat to its rule of Tibet, which became an underlying reason for triggering the Sino-Indian War. India had become the imperialist enemy, with Nehru and his \\"big bourgeoisie\\" striving to \\"prevent China from exercising full sovereignty over its territory of Tibet\\" to form of a buffer zone. On the same day, Zhou Enlai lashed out at Nehru's \\"class nature\\". India continued negotiations about Tibet. According to the Indian official history, India wished to express goodwill to China and stop the claims of it having a hostile design in Tibet. In August 1959, the Chinese army took an Indian patrol prisoner at Longju, which falls north of the McMahon Line coordinates drawn on the Simla Treaty, signed in 1914, map (27¬∞44'30\\" N), but claimed by India to lie directly on the McMahon Line. There was another bloody clash in October at Kongka Pass in Aksai Chin in which 9 Indian frontier policemen were killed. Recognizing that it was not ready for war, the Indian Army assumed responsibility for the border and pulled back patrols from disputed areas. On 2 October, Nikita Khrushchev defended Nehru in a meeting with Mao. The Soviet Union's siding with Nehru, as well as the United States' influence in the region, gave China the belief that it was surrounded by enemy forces. On 16 October, General Lei Yingfu reported on Indian expansionism on the Thag La Ridge. On 18 October, the Chinese government approved the PLA's plan of a \\"self-defensive counterattack\\" against India because of its actions in Tibet. However, Mao decided against further escalation because he feared that India would retaliate by permitting the U.S. to station U-2 surveillance aircraft on its territory.Chang, Jung and Jon Halliday, Mao: The Unknown Story (2006), pp. 568, 579. This would allow the CIA to photograph China's nuclear test site at Lop Nor in Xinjiang. A few days after Kongka Pass, Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai proposed that each side withdraw 20 kilometres from a \\"Line of Actual Control\\". He defined this line as \\"the so-called McMahon Line in the east and the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west\\". Nehru responded with a proposal to turn the disputed area into a no man's land.\\"The Shade of the Big Banyan\\" Time, 14 Dec. 1959. Chinese studies of the 1990s still maintain that India was planning aggression in Tibet. Most Chinese scholars believe that the root cause of the war was India's plan to seize Tibet and turn it into a protectorate or colony of India. The official Chinese history of the war states that Nehru was planning to create a \\"great Indian empire\\". It was also insisted that there were right wing nationalist forces that influenced Nehru to pursue the goal of controlling Tibet. Zhao Weiwen, of the Chinese Ministry of State and Security, places emphasis on Nehru's \\"dark mentality\\". China's policy on Tibet did much to heighten the conflict and tensions between the two nations. The perceptions of India as a capitalist expansionist body intent on the independence of Tibet to create a buffer zone between India proper and China were fundamentally erroneous. The negative rhetoric led to what Zhou himself called the Sino-Indian conflict. Because of these false fears, China treated the Indian Forward Policy of the 1960s, which India admits as a fundamental mistake, as the beginning of Indian expansionism into Tibet. Border negotiations China's 1958 maps showed the large strip of Northeastern part of Jammu and Kashmir (the Aksai Chin) as Chinese. In 1960, Zhou Enlai proposed that India drop its claim to Aksai Chin and China would withdraw its claims from NEFA. According to John W. Garver, Zhou's propositions were unofficial and subtle. Zhou consistently refused to accept the legitimacy of India's territorial claims; he proposed that any negotiations had to take into account the facts on the ground. Zhou tried many times to get Nehru to accept conceding Aksai Chin, he visited India four times in 1960. However, Nehru believed that China did not have a legitimate claim over both of those territories and was not ready to give away any one of them. However, they had different opinions as to the legality of the Simla agreement which eventually led to the inability to reach a decision. Nehru's adamance was seen within China as Indian opposition to Chinese rule in Tibet, as China needed the highway through Aksai Chin to maintain an effective control over the Tibetan plateau. According to Neville Maxwell, Nehru was not ready to simply concede the territory and leave negotiations at that. He was open to continued negotiations, but did not accept the idea of Indian troops withdrawing from their claimed regions. Nehru stated \\"We will negotiate and negotiate and negotiate to the bitter end. I absolutely reject the approach of stopping negotiations at any state.\\" He remained firm that there would be no boundary negotiations until Chinese troops withdrew from Aksai Chin and areas south of the British McMahon Line. This was unacceptable to China which never recognized the legal validity of the McMahon Line. Nehru stated \\"We will never compromise on our boundaries, but we are prepared to consider minor adjustments to them and to talk to the other side about them.\\" In light of these comments, the international community rallied behind Nehru in claiming that China was at fault in failing to conduct proper negotiations. Maxwell argues that Nehru's words were ambiguous. According to the official Indian history: After the talks, India produced its official reports on the talks and translated the Chinese report into English. India believed it would improve a feeling of understanding between the nations. China saw it as an unreasonable attempt by India to secure its claim lines. Nehru's adamance that China withdraw from Aksai Chin and thus abandon the highway was seen as another Indian attempt to undermine China's presence in Tibet. According to John W. Garver, China reached the incorrect conclusion that Nehru was continuing his \\"grand plans in Tibet\\". Forward policy At the beginning of 1961, Nehru appointed General B.M. Kaul QMG but he was influential in all army decisions. Kaul reorganized the general staff and removed the officers who had resisted the idea of patrolling in disputed areas, although Nehru still refused to increase military spending or otherwise prepare for war. In the summer of 1961, China began patrolling along the McMahon Line. They entered parts of Indian-administered regions and much angered the Indians in doing so. After May 1961 Chinese troops occupied Dehra Compass and established a post on the Chip Chap River. The Chinese, however, did not believe they were intruding upon Indian territory. In response the Indians launched a policy of creating outposts behind the Chinese troops so as to cut off their supplies and force their return to China. According to the Home Minister in Delhi on 4 February 1962: This has been referred to as the \\"Forward Policy\\".India's Forward Policy, Review author[s]: A. G. Noorani, The China Quarterly ¬© 1970 School of Oriental and African StudiesGregory Clark, \\"Remembering a War - The 1962 India-China Conflict\\", Rediff, There were eventually 60 such outposts, including 43 north of the McMahon Line. Kaul was confident through previous diplomacy that the Chinese would not react with force. According to the Indian Official History, Indian posts and Chinese posts were separated by a narrow stretch of land. China had been steadily spreading into those lands and India reacted with the Forward Policy to demonstrate that those lands were not unoccupied. India, of course, did not believe she was intruding on Chinese territory. British author Neville Maxwell traces this confidence to Mullik, who was in regular contact with the CIA station chief in New Delhi. Mullik may therefore have been aware of Mao's sensitivity concerning U-2 flights. The initial reaction of the Chinese forces was to withdraw when Indian outposts advanced towards them. However, this appeared to encourage the Indian forces to accelerate their Forward Policy even further. In response, the Central Military Commission adopted a policy of \\"armed coexistence\\". In response to Indian outposts encircling Chinese positions, Chinese forces would build more outposts to counter-encircle these Indian positions. This pattern of encirclement and counter-encirclement resulted in an interlocking, chessboard- like deployment of Chinese and Indian forces. Despite the leapfrogging encirclements by both sides, no hostile fire occurred from either side as troops from both sides were under orders to fire only in defense. On the situation, Mao Zedong commented, Other developments At a Communist Party conference in Beijing in January 1962, Chinese President Liu Shaoqi denounced the Great Leap Forward as responsible for widespread famine. The overwhelming majority of delegates expressed agreement, but Defense Minister Lin Biao staunchly defended Mao. A brief period of liberalization followed while Mao and Lin plotted a comeback. Jung Chang writes that China was prepared for war with India after the border clashes in May and June, but were concerned about the Nationalists, which had been making active preparations for invasion from Taiwan, and had moved large forces to the south-east coast. Transcripts from the decision for war was not made by China's leaders until early 6 October 1962, and only then were war plans drawn by China's Central Military Commission. Roderik McFarquhar states, \\"In May‚ÄìJune 1962, the main concern in Beijing was over the threat of an invasion from Taiwan... Chinese leaders would have been reluctant to provoke hostilities in the Himalayas, which might have meant diverting military resources from the main danger point along the Fujian coast.\\"Noorani, A.G., Fresh Insights into the 1962 War. Frontline. 5‚Äì18 December 1998, quoted from Roderick, McFarquhar, The Origins of the Cultural Revolution. Vol. 3, The Coming of the Cataclysm 1961-1966. Oxford University Press. The Indian military was not ready for full-scale combat. India had just annexed the Portuguese State of India or, Goa and was facing border disputes with Pakistan in Kashmir. The Indian National Congress proposed non-violent means to solving India's problems, and Indian military leaders, who proposed that India should prepare for a full-scale attack, were ignored or dismissed. Early incidents Various border conflicts and \\"military incidents\\" between India and China flared up throughout the summer and fall of 1962. According to Chinese sources, in June 1962, a minor skirmish broke out between the two sides, and dozens of members of the People's Liberation Army killed and wounded. Units of the Indian and Chinese militaries maintained close contact throughout September 1962; however, hostile fire occurred only infrequently. On 2 May 1962 the Directorate of Military Operations in India had suggested that the air force should be readied for use in NEFA and Ladakh.CIA Journals 1962 India-China War and Kargil 1999: Restrictions on Air Power by R. Sukumaran The Air Force was considered a feasible way to repel the unbalanced ratio of Chinese troops to Indian troops and the Chinese air force was assessed as only capable of limited strategic raids which could be countered by the Indian air force. Indian Air Force soon started reconnaissance flights over the NEFA border. On 7 May 1962 Chinese troops shot down an Indian Dakota plane in which young officer B. P. Tiwari was lost. Following this incident, the Indian Air Force was told not to plan for close air support. In June, 1962, the Indian Intelligence Bureau said it received information about a Chinese military buildup along the border which could result in a war. Information was also received that Pakistan was considering to attack simultaneously in the west. Chinese airfields in Tibet and Yunnan were addressed as a threat to Indian cities, as the PLAAF could conduct heavy bombings through their use of Soviet aeroplanes. On 8 July, the Chinese initiated another diplomatic communication, to protest against an alleged Indian incursion into the Galwan Valley. According to China Quarterly, the Government of India released press reports to the public indicating that Indian had gained 2,000 mi¬≤ of territory from the Chinese. However, in their diplomatic reply to the Chinese, India denied that any incident had taken place. On 10 July 1962, 350 Chinese troops surrounded an Indian post at Chushul, in the Galwan Valley, north of the MacMahon Line.Battle of Chushul They used loudspeakers to obtain contact with the Gurkha forces stationed there. The Chinese troops attempted to convince the Gurkhas that they should not be fighting for India, to cause an abandonment of the post. After a fiery argument the 350 Chinese withdrew from the area. 22 July 1962 saw a change in the Forward Policy, according to the official Indian history of the war. While the Forward Policy was initially intended to prevent the Chinese from advancing into empty areas (by occupying them first), \\"it was now decided to push back the Chinese from posts they already occupied.\\" Whereas Indian troops were previously ordered to fire only in self-defense, all post commanders were now given discretion to open fire upon Chinese forces if threatened. In August, 1962, the Chinese military improved its combat readiness along the McMahon Line, particularly in the North East Frontier Agency, Tibet and Xinjiang. In Tibet, there were constructions of ammunition dumps and stockpiling of ammunition, weapons and gasoline, though there were no indications of a manpower buildup. China's preparedness for war strongly contrasted with India's, which had largely neglected its military throughout the 1950s. Nehru believed that the Himalayas were a large enough defense against China, however, the Korean war had provided China with practice in mountain combat. This neglect on behalf of India would decide numerous pivotal battles where logistical inadequacy and lack of leadership led to defeat after strong starts. Confrontation at Thag La In June 1962, Indian forces had established an outpost at Dhola, in the Namkha Chu valley bordering the southern slopes of Thag La Ridge, overlooking the village of Le in Tibet. Based on the treaty map of the 1914 Simla Convention, the McMahon Line lay at 27¬∞45'40\\"N. However, Dhola post lay about 3.5 mile (6 km) north of the McMahon Line\\"Line of Defense\\", by Manoj Joshi, Times of India, 21 October 2000 The Indian government maintained that the intention of the McMahon Line was to set the border along the highest ridges, and that the international border fell on the highest ridges of Thag La, about north of the line drawn by Henry McMahon on the treaty map. Brigadier John Dalvi would later write of this claim: \\"The Chinese had raised a dispute about the exact alignment of the McMahon Line in the Thag La Ridge area. Therefore the Thag La-Dhola area was not strictly territory that 'we should have been convinced was ours' as directed by the Prime Minister, Mr. Nehru, and someone is guilty of exceeding the limits prescribed by him.\\" In August, China issued diplomatic protests which accused India of violating even the McMahon Line, and Chinese soldiers began occupying positions at the top of Thag La, north of Indian positions. On 8 September 1962, a 60-strong PLA unit descended from the heights and occupied positions which dominated one of the Indian posts at Dhola. Neither side opened fire for 12 days. Nehru had gone to London to attend a Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference and, when told of the act, said to the media that the Indian Army had instructions to \\"free our territory\\". According to the official Indian history, a decision was made on 9 September to evict the Chinese from the southern part of the Thag La Ridge, by force, if necessary. Two days later, it was decided that \\"all forward posts and patrols were given permission to fire on any armed Chinese who entered Indian territory\\". According to author Neville Maxwell, officers at the Indian Defense Ministry had expressed the concern that even Indian maps showed the entire Namkha Chu valley and Dhola Post-Thag La area as Chinese territory; they were told to ignore the maps. However, Nehru's directives to Defense Minister V.K. Krishna Menon were unclear, and the response, code named Operation LEGHORN, got underway only slowly. As the Chinese numbers were exaggerated to 600 instead of about 50 or 60, the 9 Punjab battalion, numbering 400 riflemen, was sent to Dhola. By the time the Indian battalion reached the Thag La Ridge area in the Chedong region on 16 September, north of the McMahon Line, Chinese units controlled both banks of the Namkha Chu valley. The day after, India's Chief of the Army Staff Gen P N Thapar ordered his men to re-take the Thag La Ridge. According to the official Indian history, on 20 September, Indian eastern command ordered all Indian posts and patrols to engage any Chinese patrols within range of their weapons. On 20 September, at one of the bridges on the river a firefight developed, killing nine Chinese and Indian soldiers. Skirmishes continued throughout September. On 3 October, Zhou Enlai visited Nehru in New Delhi, promising there would be no war between the nations and reiterating his wishes to solve the dispute diplomatically. On 4 October, a new corp was created 4 corp, under Lt. Gen. B.M. Kaul, tasked with evicting the Chinese from Dhola- Thag La 10 October was the planned date for Operation Leghorn. Because of the difficulties involved in directly assaulting and taking Thag La, Kaul made the decision instead to occupy nearby Yumtso La to the west, to position his troops behind and dominate the Chinese positions. Brigadier John Dalvi, tasked with taking Yumtso La, argued that he lacked necessary supplies and resources to take the pass. On 9 October, Kaul and Brigadier Dalvi agreed to send a patrol of 50 soldiers to Tseng Jong, the approach to Yumtso La, to occupy the position and provide cover before the rest of the battalion would move forward for the occupation of Yumtso La. On 10 October, these 50 Indian troops were met by an emplaced Chinese position of some 1,000 soldiers. The Chinese troops opened fire on the Indians believing that the Indians had intruded upon Chinese land. The Indians were surrounded by a Chinese positions which used mortar fire. However, they managed to hold off the first Chinese assault, inflicting heavy casualties. In the second assault, the Indians began their retreat, realising the situation was hopeless. The Indian patrol suffered 25 casualties, with the Chinese suffering 33. The Chinese troops held their fire as the Indians retreated, and then buried the Indian dead with military honors, as witnessed by the retreating soldiers. This was the first occurrence of heavy fighting in the war. This attack had grave implications for India and Nehru tried to solve the issue, but by 18 October it was clear that the Chinese were preparing for an attack on India, with massive troop buildups on the border.

Summary  The book is targeted to pastors and church leaders and advises them to base their ministry on God's purposes, not their own ideas of ministry, hence the term \\"Purpose Driven\\". Warren suggests that these purposes are Worship, Fellowship, Discipleship, Ministry and Mission and that they are derived from the Great Commandment (Matthew 22:37‚Äì40) and the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19‚Äì20).Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition, Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 722 Warren writes that every church is driven by something. Tradition, finances, programs, personalities, events, seekers and even buildings can each be the controlling force in a church. But he believes that in order for a church to be healthy it must built around the five New Testament purposes given to the church by Jesus. \\"The issue is church health, not church growth!\\" declares Warren. \\"If your church is healthy, growth will occur naturally. Healthy, consistent growth is the result of balancing the five biblical purposes of the church.\\" He proposes that church leaders ask of themselves, \\"What is our purpose?\\", \\"Why do we do what we do?\\", \\"What should we be doing?\\", and \\"How will you do that?\\". In this book Warren provides a guide to answer these questions on how to do church. He further suggests that following the principles he outlines in the book will enable a church to grow.George Thomas Kurian, James D. Smith III, The Encyclopedia of Christian Literature, Volume 2, Scarecrow Press, USA, 2010, p. 630 The author emphasizes an intentional people-building process. He says, ‚ÄúIf you will concentrate on building people, God will build the church.‚Äù The teaching of The Purpose Driven Church was derived from Warren's own experience in leading Saddleback Church from its founding in 1980 to over 10,000 in worship attendance in its first fifteen years, becoming one of the fastest growing churches in America during this time.  Reception  The book was a bestseller a few weeks after its publication.Chris Lehmann, The Book of Numbers, slate.com, USA, March 17, 2003 The Purpose Driven Church has been translated into over 30 languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German. It is listed in 100 Christian Books That Changed the Century and has been given many awards. For example, in 1996 and 1997, the book was the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association (ECPA) Christian Book Award Winner for the US. In 2002, the ECPA awarded it the Gold Medallion Award. The book and its author has received numerous reviews in the mainstream press and has been the subject of much support and criticism in Christian blogs and newsletters. In a May 2005 survey of American pastors and ministers conducted by George Barna, it was voted as the second book most influential on their lives and ministries, behind The Purpose Driven Life, a subsequent book by Warren.

She has written extensively on land, livelihoods and property rights; environment and development; the political economy of gender; poverty and inequality; legal change; and agriculture and technological transformation. Among her best known works is the award-winning book‚ÄîA Field of One's Own: Gender and Land Rights in South Asia‚Äîwhich has had a significant impact on governments, NGOs, and international agencies in promoting women's rights in land and property. This work has also inspired research in Latin America and globally.  Early life  Agarwal's parents were Suraj Mal and Shyama Devi Agarwal, Agarwal named a book prize in their honour. She earned her B.A. and M.A. from the University of Cambridge, and her doctorate in Economics from the Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi, her dissertation was Mechanization in Indian Agriculture: An Analytical Study Based on the Punjab.  Career  Her university positions include posts at Princeton, Harvard, Michigan, Minnesota, and New York University. At Harvard she was the first Daniel Ingalls Visiting Professor Agarwal has also been President of the International Society for Ecological Economics. Vice- President of the International Economic Association, President of the International Association for Feminist Economics, on the Board of the Global Development Network, and one of the twenty-one members of the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, chaired by Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz. She has served on the UN Committee for Development Policy (New York) and UNRISD (Geneva). She holds honorary doctorates from the Institute of Social Studies in the Netherlands and the University of Antwerp in Belgium.  Concepts and areas of focus  Agarwal's expertise is on subjects related to rural economy. She has creatively used diverse methodologies (from econometric analysis to qualitative assessments) and an interdisciplinary approach, to provide insights on land, livelihoods and property rights; environment and development; the political economy of gender; poverty and inequality; law; and agriculture and technological change. She deals especially with the connectedness of gender inequality, social exclusion, property, and development. Her pioneering work has had an impact globally both within the academia and among policy makers and practitioners. A large part of her work compares countries, especially within South Asia. In A Field of One's Own (Cambridge University Press, 1994), her most famous work, Agarwal stresses that \\"the single most important factor affecting women's situation is the gender gap in command over property.\\" She is also on the editorial board of the Journal of Women, Politics & Policy. Spurred on by Agarwal's work, and the successful movement she led in 2004‚Äì2005, Indian policy makers passed the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act in 2005. This Act gives all Hindu women (married and unmarried) equal rights with men in the ownership and inheritance of property, in particular agricultural land.\\"Nel 2005 - ha raccontato Bina Agarwal - ho guidato una campagna per modificare la legge di successione in modo da consentire in India l'ereditariet√† della terra anche alle donne. Dopo 9 mesi di battaglia, la modifica √® passata e oggi la legge sull'ereditariet√† √® completamente paritaria, uomini e donne hanno gli stessi diritti di propriet√†. E questo riguarda l'80% delle donne in India. Agarwal has consistently challenged standard economic analysis and assumptions. In her writings on the \\"bargaining approach\\" to intra-family relations, she challenges unitary household models and extends formal bargaining models to highlight the importance of social norms, social perceptions and property ownership in determining women's bargaining power. She also demonstrates the interconnectedness of the family, the community, the market and the state in determining a person's bargaining power in any one sphere. Her paper \\"Bargaining and Gender Relations\\" is the single most downloaded paper to date in the journal Feminist Economics. Pdf. In another article \\"Bargaining and Legal Change\\", Agarwal examines how women in India were able to bargain with the State to pass the inheritance laws of 1956 and bring about its amendment in 2005. In another important extension of her work on gender, property and power, Agarwal demonstrates in her empirically rigours article \\"Towards Freedom from Domestic Violence\\", that women's ability to own and inherit land acts as a significant deterrent against marital violence. Her recent books include: Psychology, Rationality and Economic Behaviour (coedited; Palgrave, 2005), Capabilities, Freedom and Equality (co-edited, Oxford University Press, Delhi, 2006). Her most recently authored book is Gender and Green Governance (Oxford University Press, Oxford and Delhi, 2010) which has been widely cited and favourably reviewed in both academic journals and the popular press (EPW and Indian Express).

Named for Adonis (a handsome youth in Greek mythology who was loved by Aphrodite), she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Originally laid down as LST-83 at Jeffersonville, Indiana on 31 March 1943 by the Jeffersonville Boat & Machine Company; launched on 14 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Frank R. Akhurst; commissioned on 6 August 1943 at Algiers, Louisiana for transportation to Baltimore, Maryland; decommissioned on 21 August 1943 for conversion by the Bethlehem Steel Company for service as a landing craft repair ship; redesignated ARL-4 on 26 August 1943 and simultaneously named Adonis; and placed in commission on 12 November 1943, Lieutenant Matthew E. Thompson in command. Service history The new landing craft repair ship soon sailed to Norfolk, Virginia for shakedown training and carried out exercises in Chesapeake Bay. She then made a cruise to New York City and finally ended her training period at Boston, Massachusetts on the last day of the year. Adonis departed Boston on 3 January 1944 with a convoy bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia. The ships arrived in Halifax on the 6th and put out to sea again on 14 January beginning a transatlantic voyage to Great Britain. The convoy reached Milford Haven, Wales on 31 January. Two days later, Adonis got under way for Devonport, England. She dropped anchor there on 5 February and commenced providing repair services to fleet units. She remained at Devonport until 26 May, and then moved to Portland Harbour. However, only a few days later, she was ordered to proceed to the assault area off the Normandy beachhead in France. Adonis got under way for her trip across the English Channel on 7 June, the day after \\"D-Day.\\" She arrived off \\"Omaha Beach\\" on the 8th and began providing repair services to damaged amphibious vessels. Rough seas made the work difficult, and the repair ship frequently changed her anchorage to avoid shellfire from enemy shore batteries. On 1 August, she cleared the area and headed back to Falmouth for repairs. The ship returned to the French coast on 25 August, anchored off \\"Utah Beach,\\" and resumed her repair work. On 1 November, she sailed to Cherbourg, France to pick up stores and equipment and returned to the waters off \\"Omaha Beach\\" on the 4th. She remained there for 10 days and was then ordered back to England. Adonis reached Devonport on 15 November, resumed her maintenance work, and remained at that port through 5 May 1945. After a pause at Belfast, Northern Ireland, the ship began her voyage back to the United States and reached her home port, Norfolk, on 31 May. Upon her arrival, the vessel was overhauled and then conducted sea trials and exercises in the Chesapeake Bay. The repair ship made a run to Davisville, Rhode Island on 22 July to take on a load of pontoons and sailed for the Pacific two days later. She transited the Panama Canal on 4 August and, while en route to San Diego received word of the Japanese surrender. After reaching San Diego on the 17th, she unloaded the pontoons at Port Hueneme, California on the 27th, and got under way for Hawaii. Upon her arrival at Pearl Harbor on 6 September, Adonis set to work converting LSMs and LCIs into troop carriers which could be used to help return military personnel to the United States. She remained in Hawaiian waters through 25 October, when the ship shaped a course for Guam where she operated until early December. She got under way for China on the 3rd, and reached Shanghai on the 12th, remaining there into early 1946. Upon leaving Shanghai on 14 March 1946 Adonis visited the Chinese ports of Taku, Chinwangtao, Hulutao, and Tsingtao. She departed the latter city on 25 April and set a course for the west coast of the United States. The ship reached Astoria, Oregon on 18 May and, shortly thereafter, began preparations for her deactivation. Adonis was decommissioned on 11 October 1946 and was assigned to the Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, Portland.

It is the yoga version of the front splits.  Etymology and origins The name comes from the Sanskrit words Hanuman (a divine entity in Hinduism who resembles a monkey) and asana (posture), and commemorates the giant leap made by Hanuman to reach the Lankan islands from the mainland of India. The pose is not described in the medieval hatha yoga texts. It appears in the 20th century in diverse traditions of modern yoga, such as in Swami Yogesvarananda's 1970 First Steps to Higher Yoga (as Vikatasana), in the Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga of Pattabhi Jois, in Swami Satyananda Saraswati's 2003 Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha, and in B. K. S. Iyengar's 1966 Light on Yoga. Description Hanumanasana is an advanced pose (rated 36 out of 64 by B. K. S. Iyengar). The pose is approached from a kneeling position, stretching one leg forwards, the other straight back, supporting the body on the hands until the full pose is mastered. The hands may then be placed in prayer position (Anjali Mudra). Finally the arms may be stretched above the head, the palms together. Iyengar states that to reach the full pose, one must make \\"several attempts each day\\" and be prepared to work at it for \\"a long time\\".

Anstis Elmina Shepard Taylor, the YLMIA general president at the time, oversaw the first publication of the journal. The periodical was unique for the time period, because of its target of a \\"young woman\\" audience. Throughout its history, the periodical was edited by the general leadership board of the YLMIA under the direction of the organization's general presidency. It was published monthly until 1929, when the magazine was absorbed by the Improvement Era, an official publication of the YLMIA and the church's equivalent organization for male adolescents. The Improvement Era then served both organizations from that time forward. The journal included messages from the MIA conferences, scriptural quotations, a plethora of short stories, recipes, meeting schedules, and pieces about morals, clothing, etc. Unlike current publications of the LDS Church, The Young Woman's Journal was subsidized by advertisements carried in the magazine.

Founded in 1993 by William Walts and George \\"Mickey\\" Richardson, the company never received enough funding to begin operations. Concept Upset not only by the non-smoking policy of most major airlines but also by the quality of other amenities such as food and in-flight entertainment, Walts conceived the idea of a \\"smokers airline\\". His company would not only allow smoking on flights, but encourage it by handing out free cigarettes and \\"full-size\\" ashtrays during flight. The airline also advertised free headsets (for listening to in-flight entertainment) and \\"real food for real people\\", which consisted of hamburgers, pizza, and steaks. Because Federal Aviation Administration restrictions prohibit smoking on flights within the United States, Smokers Express was intended to be a membership- based airline. Customers would have been required to join and pay a $25 yearly fee, and only persons age 21 or older would have been allowed to join. A side effect to this policy was a promise that the flights would be free of \\"screaming babies.\\" Aircraft The company began by purchasing three McDonnell Douglas DC-9 aircraft, with the intention of leasing 27 additional DC-9s. The aircraft would have been renovated with a high-volume air recirculation system, as well as improved flame-retardant carpet. Routes The airline originally intended to fly to 11 different destinations, adding more as additional funding enabled. The planned initial destinations were: *Las Vegas, Nevada *Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth, Texas *Houston, Texas *New Orleans, Louisiana *Oklahoma City, Oklahoma *Tulsa, Oklahoma *Newark, New Jersey *Atlantic City, New Jersey *Orlando, Florida *Titusville, Florida *Miami, Florida The first flight would have taken place on August 16, 1993. Company structure Smokers Express was designed to be an employee-owned company. It relied mostly on membership dues and ticket sales, however, no tickets were ever sold. The company did not advertise directly, but relied on word-of- mouth, various articles and TV news references. Despite what the company perceived as a positive response to their concept, it failed to raise enough funds to begin operations.

It was created in 1980 during the controversy surrounding the protection of Endau Rompin forest complex. The act provides for the states to establish national parks to be administered by Department of Wildlife and National Parks under the federal government. During its passing, the debate on state and federal power was common. The states and in particular Johor within the context of that time did not agree to the act as it was seen as surrendering states' right to the federal government. This objection prevented the Endau and Rompin from being gazetted as a national park prior to the 1990s. The act still gives rights for the State Authority to vote sections of land can be preserved for maintenance of roads, airstrips, reservoirs, dams, and service buildings. This Act shall not apply to Sabah and Sarawak and the State Parks of Kelantan, Pahang and Terengganu which together constitute the Taman Negara as described in the Schedule to the Taman Negara (Kelantan) Enactment [En. 14 of 1938] and in the First Schedules to the Taman Negara (Pahang) Enactment 1939 [En. 2 of 1938] and the Taman Negara (Terengganu) Enactment [En. 6 of 1358H].

This establishment was created to protect wild life and objects of the environment while promoting education of conservation to the people of Malaysia. National Park Advisory Council and its functions The National Park Advisory Council was established to create a representative body for the National Parks. This would ensure different levels within the council to ensure different checks on committees. Positions include Chairman, State Secretary of each State where National Parks are located, Director General, Treasurer, representative of the Economic Planning Unit of the Prime Minister's Department, representative of the Tourist Development Corporation, and representative of the Department of Forestry.Laws of Malaysia Act 226: National Parks Act 1980 These positions will ensure the conservation and development of the National Park. Occupation of lands Any land that is leased by the State Authorities are under the consideration of the National Park which can be used for the construction and maintenance or roads, airstrips, dams and reservoirs, hotels, rest houses, dwelling houses, buildings, works of public utility, and mining. Several restrictions do come with the general prohibition of mining within the National Park such as the contradiction of general interests to the State and the failure to have a license to mine. Although the land can be used for mining, there is general restrictions prohibiting the use of mining within the National Park. In order for mining to occur, the National Park must see a mining certificate or lease issued that grants rights to the passage. Without such, there will be implications due to the respect o the National Park Land. Regulation of lands The State Authority may still make regulations to the Act that will further the protection of the wildlife or land preservation. Acts include prohibition of killing, capturing wildlife, burning or cutting down vegetation within the National Park, or other regulations of misconduct that would harm the enjoyment of the National Park.

It was purchased by Golden Entertainment in October 2017 for $850 million.https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/golden-closes- on-850m-deal-for-stratosphere-3-other-casinos/ ACEP was a casino holding company headquartered at the Stratosphere Las Vegas. ACEP was a wholly owned subsidiary of American Real Estate Partners before it was sold to Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds, an investment arm of Goldman Sachs, in February 2008. The company owned the following 4 casinos: Aquarius Casino Resort, Arizona Charlie's Decatur, Arizona Charlie's Boulder and Stratosphere Las Vegas. Golden Entertainment acquired ACEP from Whitehall. History Shortly after opening, the Stratosphere Las Vegas on April 30, 1996, the Stratosphere Corporation was forced to file for bankruptcy. After acquiring a majority of the bonds, ACEP gained control of the casino. Carl Icahn acquired the four properties for $300 million. On November 29, 2005, Harrah's Entertainment announced plans to sell the Flamingo Laughlin casino to ACEP. The sale closed on May 19, 2006, and the Flamingo Laughlin was renamed the Aquarius Casino Resort in October 2006. On April 23, 2007, it was announced that ACEP was being sold for $1.3 billion to Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds, an investment fund managed by Goldman Sachs. The sale closed on February 21, 2008. Although revenue for 2008 had only slipped by 4.47% from 2007, the interest costs of acquisition had turned ACEP into a money losing operation. ACEP registered its first positive net income since 2007 of $7.0 million in 2014 and $12.1 million in 2015. In 2007, Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds, who owned 40% of the Las Vegas Hilton and was a passive investor in other casino properties, made an offer of $1.3 billion for the four properties. The appraisal assigned a value of $718 million to the land under the four properties. The buildings were worth $366 million. The land valuation seemed to be almost entirely based on the undeveloped of land near the Stratosphere. On February 21, 2008, the ownership of ACEP changed hands from the previous owner, Carl Icahn, to Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds. The new owners retired the $255 million senior notes held by the former owner and replaced them with $1.1 billion in new notes held by Goldman Sachs Term Loans. The interest on these loans far exceeded the net income of the company in 2007. The income of the company had to grow to cover this new financing. In 2008, ACEP completed $54.0 million in renovations at the Aquarius Casino Resort.American Casino & Entertainment Properties LLC 2012 Form 10-K Annual Report By the 4th quarter of 2008, the company's revenue began plummeting precipitously. The cost of the acquisition was so considerable that the company was operating at a net loss. In March 2009, the company announced that it would begin layoffs. In May 2009, Whitehall was in discussions to restructure the debt with its lender, Goldman Sachs, due to concerns that the company could default if gaming and visitor numbers continued to decline. Whitehall, which is an affiliate of Goldman, was finalizing terms of an agreement that would see Goldman forgive $593 million of the $1.1 billion debt load. Whitehall would also be released from an additional $200 million in additional debt. In exchange for the debt relief, a mortgage unit of Goldman would gain a 22 percent interest in the company. In 2009, net revenue fell to $356 million, its lowest since 2005. The company restructured its debt in the last quarter and laid off 600 employees. In 2011, ACEP completed $20 million in renovations at the Stratosphere, updating its rooms and casino floor and promoted the changes within new marketing campaign. The Stratosphere also added a lounge called Sky Lounge 107 the 108th floor. In addition to the renovations, Stratosphere added a new thrill ride, the Sky Jump. By 2015, net revenues had increased to $373 million. In June 2017, Whitehall agreed to sell ACEP to Golden Entertainment for $850 million. On October 2, 2017, Golden Entertainment closed on its $850 million purchase of the four casinos owned by ACEP.

Personal history Samwell was born in Nantglyn, a small village in Denbighshire to William Samuel a local vicar. His grandfather, Edward Samuel was also a notable Welsh author and poet. Samwell became a surgeon in the Royal Navy and between 1776 and 1779 he sailed around the world with Captain James Cook on board .McCririck (1963) p. 30 As a ship's surgeon it was Samwell's job to ensure the crew's health did not deteriorate over the long journeys to the Pacific Ocean. Aboard the ship Samwell wrote of his travels, including some poetry. The journal of his experiences aboard Captain James Cook's ship provide a detailed account of the third and last voyages of Cook to the Pacific Ocean. Part of the journal Samwell, David. A Narrative of the Death of Captain James Cook. London, 1786. describes the death of Captain Cook at the hands of natives on the Sandwich Islands in 1779. He also wrote an unpublished journal, Some Account of a Voyage to the South Seas 1776-1777-1778 which is an innovative work of social anthropology. Between his voyages, Samwell lived in London. There he and other Welshmen would meet, and he joined the Gwyneddigion Society which had formed in 1770.McCririck (1963) p. 31 The society was initially formed for men from North Wales, but gradually the membership grew to accept all Welshmen. The society celebrated with a rowdy ball every St David's Day and Samwell was described as one of the noisiest. He was described as 'tall, stout, blackhaired, pock-marked, fierce looking, wondrous friendly in company' and when teased he would close one eye and look for a pot to throw at his tormenter. In 1792 Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams) organised here the first meeting of Gorsedd Beirdd Ynys Prydain at Primrose Hill in London. Samwell was present at the event which saw a stone circle set and a sword was ceremonially sheathed as a symbol of peace after the events of the French Revolution. The next year though saw Britain enter conflict with France during the French Revolutionary Wars, and in 1798 Samwell was treating English prisoners of war in Versailles. He returned to Britain in the autumn of that year and died in London in November.

The distributed learning model can be used in combination with traditional classroom-based courses and traditional distance education courses (in which it is also deferred to as blended learning, or it can be used to create entirely virtual classrooms.) There is much confusion globally over distinctions between and definitions of distributed learning, distance education, open learning, e-learning, blended learning and other related terms. Many terms are used more commonly in particular geographies. Distinctions can arise when the chosen model focuses on either or both time and geographic distances. Distributed learning may be dependent on time if it includes synchronous sessions and further time dependent if the course is paced. The oldest and most commonly used of these terms, distance education, can be used to describe distributed learning as defined above. 'Distributed education' lacks a correspondence school tone and history and thus is perceived as making more use of communications and especially synchronous communications technologies. Further research using both terms 'distance' and 'distributed education' returns better results with consider overlap. Distributed learning is a viable option for many individuals of all ages who desire to get an education. It holds a number of advantages and a traditional learning environment.

The war memorial with \\"Athelstan's Tower\\" on the city wall behind The site was originally quarried in Roman times for stone for the city walls. The gardens incorporate a stretch of Roman wall and the only length of Saxon town wall to be seen in England. They form a crescent shape bounded to the north by the West of England Main Line and Exeter Central railway station, and to the south by the castle and Rougemont Gardens. Their eastern entrance is at the head of Northernhay Place and the gardens open on the west to Northernhay Gate. The early park was destroyed in the Civil War, in 1642, when large defensive ditches were dug outside the walls for the city's defence. Soon after the Restoration, in 1664, the city set about restoring the park, planting hundreds of young elms and laying out gravel paths. There has been a tradition of maintaining the park as a major city amenity since that time. The gardens underwent a major re-landscaping in 1860, and between 1860 and 1895 received an important group of monuments to major Victorian figures in the city's history. The Deer Stalker (1875) by E. B. Stephens (1815‚Äì1882), is a significant piece of Victorian art that was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1876. Stephens also sculpted the statues of John Dinham, who was a local philanthropist, and Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet, in the gardens. The statue of the Conservative politician Stafford Northcote (1887) is by Joseph Boehm. The Volunteer Memorial (1895), designed by S. K. Greenslade, commemorates the formation of the 1st Rifle Volunteers in 1852, and the Exeter War Memorial by local sculptor John Angel was constructed in 1923. The gardens also contain a bandstand. In the mid 1900s the mature avenue of elms lining the central walk succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease and were felled. Subsequent planting has sought to provide all-year-round colour and interest. The gardens offer views over large parts of the city, and events are hosted there throughout the year.

He studied painting at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago during the 1910s, graduating in 1918. Motley is most famous for his colorful chronicling of the African-American experience during the 1920s and 1930s, and is considered one of the major contributors to the Harlem Renaissance, or the New Negro Movement, a time in which African-American art reached new heights not just in New York but across America‚Äîits local expression is referred to as the Chicago Black Renaissance. The Renaissance marked a period of a flourishing and renewed black psyche. There was a newfound appreciation of black artistic and aesthetic culture. Consequently, many black artists felt a moral obligation to create works that would perpetuate a positive representation of black people. During this time, Alain Locke coined the idea of the \\"New Negro\\", which was focused on creating progressive and uplifting images of blacks within society. The synthesis of black representation and visual culture drove the basis of Motley's work as \\"a means of affirming racial respect and race pride.\\" His use of color and notable fixation on skin-tone, demonstrated his artistic portrayal of blackness as being multidimensional. Motley himself was of mixed race, and often felt unsettled about his own racial identity. Thus, his art often demonstrated the complexities and multifaceted nature of black culture and life. Early life and education Archibald Motley Self Portrait Unlike many other Harlem Renaissance artists, Archibald Motley, Jr., never lived in Harlem. He was born in New Orleans, Louisiana to Mary Huff Motley and Archibald John Motley Senior. His mother was a school teacher until she married. The family remained in New Orleans until 1894 when they moved to Chicago, where his father took a job as a Pullman car porter. As a boy growing up on Chicago's south side, Motley had many jobs, and when he was nine years old his father's hospitalization for six months required that Motley help support the family. Motley spent the majority of his life in Chicago, where he was a contemporary of fellow Chicago artists Eldzier Cortor and Gus Nall. He lived in a predominantly-white neighborhood, and attended majority-white primary and secondary schools. He graduated from Englewood Technical Prep Academy in Chicago.Georgiady, N., L. Romano, and R. Green, Archibald J. Motley: American Negro Artist. Franklin Publishers, Inc, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 1969. He was offered a scholarship to study architecture by one of his father's friends, which he turned down in order to study art.\\"Motley, Archibald Jr. 1891‚Äì1981\\", Encyclopedia.com. He attended the Art Institute of Chicago, where he received classical training, but his modernist-realist works were out of step with the school's then-conservative bent. During his time at the Art Institute, Motley was mentored by painters Earl Beuhr and John W. Norton, and he did well enough to cause his father's friend to pay his tuition. While he was a student, in 1913, other students at the Institute \\"rioted\\" against the modernism on display at the Armory Show (a collection of the best new modern art).Martinez, Andrew, \\"A Mixed Reception for Modernism: The 1913 Armory Show at the Art Institute of Chicago,\\" The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, vol. 19, no. 1, 1993, p. 31. Motley graduated in 1918 but kept his modern, jazz-influenced paintings secret for some years thereafter.Woodall, Elaine D. , \\"Looking Backward: Archibald J. Motley and the Art Institute of Chicago: 1914‚Äì1930,\\" Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society, Spring 1979, vol. VIII, no. 1, pp. 53‚Äì57. As a result of his training in the western portrait tradition, Motley understood nuances of phrenology and physiognomy that went along with the aesthetics. He used these visual cues as a way to portray (black) subjects more positively. For example, in Motley's \\"self-portrait,\\" he painted himself in a way that aligns with many of these physical pseudosciences. The slightly squinted eyes and tapered fingers are all subtle indicators of insight, intelligence, and refinement. Foreign study and inspirations In 1927 he had applied for a Guggenheim Fellowship and was denied, but he reapplied and won the fellowship in 1929. He studied in France for a year, and chose not to extend his fellowship another six months. While many contemporary artists looked back to Africa for inspiration, Motley was inspired by the great Renaissance masters whose work was displayed at the Louvre.Motley, Archibald, Jr. Oral History Interview with Archibald Motley. Interview by Dennis Barrie for the Smithsonian Archives of American Art. He found in the artwork there a formal sophistication and maturity that could give depth to his own work, particularly in the Dutch painters and the genre paintings of Delacroix, Hals, and Rembrandt. Motley's portraits take the conventions of the Western tradition and update them‚Äîallowing for black bodies, specifically black female bodies, a space in a history that had traditionally excluded them. He felt that portraits in particular exposed a certain transparency of truth of the internal self. Thus, he would focus on the complexity of the individual in order to break from popularized caricatural stereotypes of blacks such as the \\"darky,\\" \\"pickaninny,\\" \\"mammy,\\" etc. Motley understood the power of the individual, and the ways in which portraits could embody a sort of palpable machine that could break this homogeneity. He took advantage of his westernized educational background in order to harness certain visual aesthetics that were rarely associated with blacks. Thus, he would use his knowledge as a tool for individual expression in order to create art that was meaningful aesthetically and socially to a broader American audience. By acquiring these skills, Motley was able to break the barrier of white-world aesthetics. The use of this acquired visual language would allow his work to act as a vehicle for racial empowerment and social progress. Career In the beginning of his career as an artist, Motley intended to solely pursue portrait painting. After graduating from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1918, he decided that he would focus his art on black subjects and themes, ultimately as an effort to relieve racial tensions. In 1919, Chicago's south side race riots rendered his family housebound for over six days. In the midst of this heightened racial tension, Motley was very aware of the clear boundaries and consequences that came along with race. He understood that he had certain educational and socioeconomic privileges, and thus, he made it his goal to use these advantages to uplift the black community. Motley experienced success early in his career; in 1927 his piece Mending Socks was voted the most popular painting at the Newark Museum in New Jersey.Robinson, Jontyle Theresa, and Charles Austin Page Jr., \\"Mending socks and tales of Africa,\\" The Christian Science Monitor, October 15, 1987. Retrieved 2015-10-03 from www.csmonitor.com. He was awarded the Harmon Foundation award in 1928, and then became the first African American to have a one-man exhibit in New York City. He sold 22 out of the 26 exhibited paintings. Motley would go on to become the first black artist to have a portrait of a black subject displayed at Chicago's Art Institute. Most of his popular portraiture was created during the mid 1920s. However, there was an evident artistic shift that occurred particularly in the 1930s. Motley strayed from the western artistic aesthetic, and began to portray more urban black settings with a very non-traditional aesthetic style. By breaking from the conceptualized structure of westernized portraiture, he began to depict what was essentially a reflection of an authentic black community. Ultimately, his portraiture was essential to his career in that it demonstrated the roots of his adopted educational ideals and privileges, which essentially gave him the template to be able to progress as an artist and aesthetic social advocate. During the 1930s, Motley was employed by the federal Works Progress Administration to depict scenes from African- American history in a series of murals, some of which can be found at Nichols Middle School in Evanston, Illinois. After his wife's death in 1948 and difficult financial times, Motley was forced to seek work painting shower curtains for the Styletone Corporation. In the 1950s, he made several visits to Mexico and began painting Mexican life and landscapes.Archibald Motley Biography Skin tone and identity NARA black-and-white photograph of \\"Getting Religion\\" painting by Motley (original painting in color) Motley's family lived in a quiet neighborhood on Chicago's south side in an environment that was racially tolerant. In his youth, Motley did not spend much time around other blacks. It was this disconnection with the African-American community around him that established Motley as an outsider. Motley himself was light skinned and of mixed racial makeup, being African, Native American and European. Unable to fully associate with either black nor white, Motley wrestled all his life with his own racial identity. Although Motley reinforces the association of higher social standing with \\"whiteness\\" or American determinates of beauty, he also exposes the diversity within the race as a whole. Motley's work made it much harder for viewers to categorize a person as strictly black or white. He showed the nuances and variability that exists within a race, making it harder to enforce a strict racial ideology. Motley used portraiture \\"as a way of getting to know his own people\\". He realized that in American society, different statuses were attributed to each gradation of skin tone. Motley portrayed skin color and physical features as belonging to a spectrum. He used distinctions in skin color and physical features to give meaning to each shade of African American. In the 1920s and 1930s, during the New Negro Renaissance, Motley dedicated a series of portraits to types of Negroes. He focused mostly on women of mixed racial ancestry, and did numerous portraits documenting women of varying African-blood quantities (\\"octoroon,\\" \\"quadroon,\\" \\"mulatto\\"). In titling his pieces, Motley used these antebellum creole classifications (\\"mulatto,\\" \\"octoroon,\\" etc.) in order to show the social implications of the \\"one drop rule,\\" and the dynamics of what it means to black. He would expose these different \\"negro types\\" as a way to counter the fallacy of labeling all blacks as a generalized people. These direct visual reflections of status represented the broader social construction of blackness, and its impact on black relations. By asserting the individuality of African Americans in portraiture, Motley essentially demonstrated blackness as being \\"worthy of formal portrayal.\\" These portraits celebrate skin tone as something diverse, inclusive, and pluralistic.Harris, Michael D. \\"Color Lines: Mapping Color Consciousness in the Art of Archibald Motley, Jr.\\" Colored Pictures: Race and Visual Representation. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003. They also demonstrate an understanding that these categorizations become synonymous with public identity and influence one's opportunities in life.De Souza, Pauline. \\"Black Awakening: Gender and Representation in the Harlem Renaissance.\\" in Katy Deepwell (ed.), Women Artists and Modernism, Manchester University Press, 1998, pp. 55-69. It is often difficult if not impossible to tell what kind of racial mixture the subject has without referring to the title. These physical markers of blackness, then, are unstable and unreliable, and Motley exposed that difference. A painting by Motley with very bright colors Motley spoke to a wide audience of both whites and blacks in his portraits, aiming to educate them on the politics of skin tone, if in different ways. He hoped to prove to blacks through art that their own racial identity was something to be appreciated. For white audiences he hoped to bring an end to black stereotypes and racism by displaying the beauty and achievements of African Americans. By displaying the richness and cultural variety of African Americans, the appeal of Motley's work was extended to a wide audience. Many were captivated by his portraiture because it contradicted stereotyped images, and instead displayed the \\"contemporary black experience.\\" This is consistent with Motley's aims of portraying an absolutely accurate and transparent representation of African Americans; his commitment to differentiating between skin types shows his meticulous efforts to specify even the slightest differences between individuals. In an interview with the Smithsonian Institution, Motley explained his motives and the difficulty behind painting the different skin tones of African Americans: > They're not all the same color, they're not all black, they're not all, as > they used to say years ago, high yellow, they're not all brown. I try to > give each one of them character as individuals. And that's hard to do when > you have so many figures to do, putting them all together and still have > them have their characteristics. (Motley, 1978) By painting the differences in their skin tones, Motley is also attempting to bring out the differences in personality of his subjects. It could be interpreted that through this differentiating, Motley is asking white viewers not to lump all African Americans into the same category or stereotype, but to get to know each of them as individuals before making any judgments.Oral history interview with Archibald Motley, 1978 Jan. 23-1979 Mar. 1 - Oral Histories  Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution In this way, his work used colorism and class as central mechanisms to subvert stereotypes. By harnessing the power of the individual, his work engendered positive propaganda that would incorporate \\"black participation in a larger national culture.\\" Motley's work pushed the ideal of the multifariousness of blackness in a way that was widely aesthetically communicable and popular. In the end, this would instill a sense of personhood and individuality for blacks through the vehicle of visuality. Many whites wouldn't give Motley commissions to paint their portraits, yet the majority of his collectors were white. He was able to expose a part of the black community that was often not seen by whites, and thus, through aesthetics, broaden the scope of the authentic black experience. During this time, Alain Locke coined the idea of the \\"New Negro,\\" which was very focused on creating progressive and uplifting images of blacks within society. In addition, many magazines such as the Chicago Defender, The Crisis, and Opportunity all aligned with prevalent issues of black representation. Aesthetics had a powerful influence in expanding the definitions of race. Consequently, many were encouraged to take an artistic approach in the context of social progress. In The Crisis, Carl Van Vechten wrote, \\"What are negroes when they are continually painted at their worst and judged by the public as they are painted ... preventing white artists from knowing any other types (of blacks) and preventing black artists from daring to paint them...\\" Motley would use portraiture as a vehicle for positive propaganda by creating visual representations of black diversity and humanity. He would break down the dichotomy between blackness and Americanness by demonstrating social progress through complex visual narratives. Works and observation of jazz culture NARA black-and-white photograph of \\"Black Belt,\\" painting by Motley (original painting in color) His night scenes and crowd scenes, heavily influenced by jazz culture, are perhaps his most popular and most prolific. He depicted a vivid, urban black culture that bore little resemblance to the conventional and marginalizing rustic images of black Southerners so familiar in popular culture.Pilgrim, David. \\"The Mammy Caricature\\". The Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia. Big Rapids: Ferris State University, 2000. It is important to note, however, that it was not his community he was representing‚Äîhe was among the affluent and elite black community of Chicago. He married a white woman and lived in a white neighborhood, and was not a part of that urban experience in the same way his subjects were. Bronzeville at Night In his paintings of jazz culture, Motley often depicted Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood, which offered a safe haven for blacks migrating from the South.Amy M. Mooney, Archibald J. Motley Jr. (2004), p. 86. One of his most famous works showing the urban black community is Bronzeville at Night, showing African Americans as actively engaged, urban peoples who identify with the city streets. In the work, Motley provides a central image of the lively street scene and portrays the scene as a distant observer, capturing the many individual interactions but paying attention to the big picture at the same time.Amy M. Mooney, Archibald J. Motley Jr. (2004), p. 95. Like many of his other works, Motley's cross-section of Bronzeville lacks a central narrative. For example, a brooding man with his hands in his pockets gives a stern look. Behind the bus, a man throws his arms up ecstatically. In the center, a man exchanges words with a partner, his arm up and head titled as if to show that he is making a point. By displaying a balance between specificity and generalization, he allows \\"the viewer to identify with the figures and the places of the artist's compositions.\\" Stomp In Stomp, Motley painted a busy cabaret scene which again documents the vivid urban black culture. The excitement in the painting is palpable: one can observe a woman in a white dress throwing her hands up to the sound of the music, a couple embracing‚Äîhand in hand‚Äîin the back of the cabaret, the lively pianist watching the dancers. Both black and white couples dance and hobnob with each other in the foreground. For example, on the right of the painting, an African-American man wearing a black tuxedo dances with a woman whom Motley gives a much lighter tone. By doing this, he hoped to counteract perceptions of segregation. Critics of Motley point out that the facial features of his subjects are in the same manner as minstrel figures. But Motley had no intention to stereotype and hoped to use the racial imagery to increase \\"the appeal and accessibility of his crowds.\\"Amy M. Mooney, Archibald J. Motley Jr. (2004), p. 88. It opened up a more universal audience for his intentions to represent African-American progress and urban lifestyle. Octoroon Girl The Octoroon Girl features a woman who is one-eighth black. In the image a graceful young woman with dark hair, dark eyes and light skin sits on a sofa while leaning against a warm red wall. She wears a black velvet dress with red satin trim, a dark brown hat and a small gold chain with a pendant. In her right hand, she holds a pair of leather gloves. The woman stares directly at the viewer with a soft, but composed gaze. Her face is serene. Motley balances the painting with a picture frame and the rest of the couch on the left side of the painting. Her clothing and background all suggest that she is of higher class. The poised posture and direct gaze project confidence. The way in which her elongated hands grasp her gloves demonstrates her sense of style and elegance. Motley's use of physicality and objecthood in this portrait demonstrates conformity to white aesthetic ideals, and shows how these artistic aspects have very realistic historical implications. Motley was \\"among the few artists of the 1920s who consistently depicted African Americans in a positive manner.\\" The Octoroon Girl is an example of this effort to put African-American women in a good light ‚Äì or, perhaps, simply to make known the realities of middle class African-American life. Motley's presentation of the woman not only fulfilled his desire to celebrate accomplished blacks but also created an aesthetic role model to which those who desired an elite status might look up to. The Octoroon Girl was meant to be a symbol of social, racial, and economic progress. In Motley's paintings, he made little distinction between octoroon women and white women, depicting octoroon women with material representations of status and European features. It appears that the message Motley is sending to his white audience is that even though the octoroon woman is part African American, she clearly does not fit the stereotype of being poor and uneducated. He requests that white viewers look beyond the genetic indicators of her race and see only the way she acts now‚Äîdistinguished, poised and with dignity. In his attempt to deconstruct the stereotype, Motley has essentially removed all traces of the octoroon's race. The Mulatress In his portrait The Mulatress (1924), Motley features a \\"mulatto\\" sitter who is very poised and elegant in the way that \\"the octoroon girl\\" is. The sitter is strewn with jewelry, and sits in such a way that projects a certain chicness and relaxedness. She is portrayed as elegant, but a sharpness and tenseness are evident in her facial expression. Motley was ultimately aiming to portray the troubled and convoluted nature of the \\"tragic mulatto.\\" Motley himself identified with this sense of feeling caught in the middle of one's own identity. Thus, this portrait speaks to the social implications of racial identity by distinguishing the \\"mulatto\\" from the upper echelons of black society that was reserved for \\"octoroons.\\" In this way, Motley used portraiture in order to demonstrate the complexities of the impact of racial identity. Motley used sharp angles and dark contrasts within the model's face to indicate that she was emotional or defiant. While this gave the subject more personality and depth, it can also be said the Motley played into the stereotype that black women are angry and vindictive. Many of the opposing messages that are present in Motley's works are attributed to his relatively high social standing which would create an element of bias even though Motley was also black. Still, Motley was one of the only artists of the time willing to paint African- American models with such precision and accuracy. He treated these portraits as a quasi-scientific study in the different gradients of race. The distinction between the girl's couch and the mulatress' wooden chair also reveals the class distinctions that Motley associated with each of his subjects. In this series of portraits, Motley draws attention to the social distinctions of each subject. Nightlife During this period, Motley developed a reusable and recognizable language in his artwork, which included contrasting light and dark colors, skewed perspectives, strong patterns and the dominance of a single hue. He also created a set of characters who appeared repeatedly in his paintings with distinctive postures, gestures, expressions and habits. These figures were often depicted standing very close together, if not touching or overlapping one another. Nightlife depicts a bustling night club with people dancing in the background, sitting at tables on the right and drinking at a bar on the left. The entire image is flushed with a burgundy light that emanates from the floor and walls, creating a warm, rich atmosphere for the club-goers. The rhythm of the music can be felt in the flailing arms of the dancers, who appear to be performing the popular Lindy hop. In contrast, the man in the bottom right corner sits and stares in a drunken stupor. Another man in the center and a woman towards the upper right corner also sit isolated and calm in the midst of the commotion of the club. In an interview with the Smithsonian Institution, Motley explained this disapproval of racism he tries to dispel with Nightlife and other paintings: > And that's why I say that racism is the first thing that they have got to > get out of their heads, forget about this damned racism, to hell with > racism. ... That means nothing to an artist. We're all human beings. And the > sooner that's forgotten and the sooner that you can come back to yourself > and do the things that you want to do. (Motley 1978) In this excerpt, Motley calls for the removal of racism from social norms. He goes on to say that especially for an artist, it shouldn't matter what color of skin someone has‚Äîeveryone is equal. He suggests that once racism is erased, everyone can focus on his or her self and enjoy life. In Nightlife, the club patrons appear to have forgotten racism and are making the most of life by having a pleasurable night out listening and dancing to jazz music. As a result of the club-goers removal of racism from their thoughts, Motley can portray them so pleasantly with warm colors and inviting body language. Family When Motley was a child, his maternal grandmother lived with the family. She had been a slave after having been taken from British East Africa. She shared her stories about slavery with the family, and the young Archibald listened attentively. He describes his grandmother's surprisingly positive recollections of her life as a slave in his oral history on file with the Smithsonian Archive of American Art. During World War I, he accompanied his father on many railroad trips that took him all across the country, to destinations including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Hoboken, Atlanta and Philadelphia. It was this exposure to life outside Chicago that led to Motley's encounters with race prejudice in many forms. In his oral history interview with Dennis Barrie working for the Smithsonian Archive of American Art, Motley related this encounter with a streetcar conductor in Atlanta, Georgia: > I wasn't supposed to go to the front. So I was reading the paper and walking > along, after a while I found myself in the front of the car. The conductor > was in the back and he yelled, \\"Come back here you so-and-so\\" using very > vile language, \\"you come back here. You must be one of those smart'uns from > up in Chicago or New York or somewhere.\\" It just came to me then and I felt > like a fool. I was never white in my life but I think I turned white. I just > stood there and held the newspaper down and looked at him. I walked back > there. Then he got so nasty, he began to curse me out and call me all kinds > of names using very degrading language. I just couldn't take it. And he made > me very, very angry. I used to have quite a temper. Motley married his high school sweetheart Edith Granzo in 1924, whose German immigrant parents were opposed to their interracial relationship and disowned her for her marriage. His nephew (raised as his brother), Willard Motley, was an acclaimed writer known for his 1947 novel Knock on Any Door. Death Motley died in Chicago on January 16, 1981.

It has both waterfront views of Tampa Bay and views of the city's skyline. Harbour Island is across the eponymous bridge on the other side of the Garrison Channel. The center is connected to the neighboring Channelside District and Ybor City via the TECO Line Streetcar, which has a station across the street. The center opened in 1990 and encompasses in total. It has a exhibit hall, a ballroom capable of accommodating over 2,000 guests, and 36 meeting rooms that can be adjusted to various sizes. The facility hosts over 300 events per year. History The Tampa Convention Center is built on the historical site of Fort Brooke, the original American outpost on Tampa Bay established in 1824. The community of Tampa slowly grew around Fort Brooke through two wars with the Seminole Indians and the American Civil War. The post was decommissioned by the United States Army in 1883 and the land was sold for private use. The former location of the fort was used for various industrial and commercial purposes until the late 1980s, when it was cleared to make way for a new convention center to replace Tampa's aging Curtis Hixon Hall. Construction began in early 1989, with the city of Tampa paying the $140 million cost by issuing municipal bonds. It opened in October 1990. Hotels The city's original development plan called for the Tampa Convention Center to be built concurrently with a large hotel. However, financial difficulties and problems with developers caused this portion of the plan to be delayed until 2000, when the 27-story Tampa Marriott Waterside Hotel, the city's largest, opened less than a block away on Garrison Channel. In 2006, more adjacent lodging was added when a 20-story Embassy Suites hotel opened directly across Franklin Street from the convention center. The newer hotel is connected to the convention center via a skybridge. Major events The Tampa Convention Center was the media center for the 2012 Republican National Convention, which was held approximately two blocks away at the Tampa Bay Times Forum. It hosts the yearly Tampa Bay Comic Con, anime convention MetroCon, as well as the Florida Bar Exam.

One of his principal buildings was at Grange Park, Northington which he designed and constructed from 1664 to 1670 for Sir Robert Henley. There are no known pictures of the Samwell house. The Grange, Northington was subsequently remodelled by William Wilkins and is one of the earliest Greek Revival houses in Europe. He also designed and built Bushy House from 1664 to 1665 for Edward Proger. Having established himself under King Charles II, he was commissioned to build the King's residence in Newmarket from 1668 to 1671. Sometime after 1814, most of the residence was demolished. Today, the remaining southeast block is known as 'The Palace House Mansion'. In 1672, Samwell and William Bruce enlarged and remodeled Ham House, the residence of John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale and Elizabeth, 2nd Countess of Dysart. From 1674 to 1675, Samwell designed the west wing of Felbrigg Hall and the original Eaton Hall, but he did not live to see these last two projects to the end of their construction.

The objectives of the party included resistance against the feudalists and the comprador bourgeoisie, recover lands claimed by Saudi Arabia and reunification with South Yemen. The party supported the struggle of the National Liberation Front in South Yemen against the rule of Qahtan ash-Sha'bi. The party supported the idea of taking up armed struggle, but initially the party leadership considered the conditions for guerrilla struggle in North Yemen premature. Generally the party had its main base in urban areas, and could not muster rural tribal forces against the government. The party had some links with junior army officers, but could not build up a strong military structure. On August 23‚Äì24, 1968 clashes erupted between government troops attacked militants of the party, resulting in a temporary setback for the party. In early 1970 the party founded the People's Revolutionary Army as its military wing. Alongside the Organisation of Revolutionary Resistors of Yemen, it began guerrilla warfare against government and tribal forces. On March 23, 1973, the party signed a joint appeal of political forces in North Yemen against the ceding of Yemeni territories to Saudi Arabia. The party was led by a Politburo and a Central Committee. At its founding conference, an 11-member Central Committee was elected. On February 2, 1976, the party, together with the Organisation of Revolutionary Resistors of Yemen, the Labour Party, the Popular Vanguard and the People's Democratic Union, founded the National Democratic Front in San'a. On March 5, 1979 the party merged with the other founding parties of the NDF, forming the Yemeni Popular Unity Party.

More specifically, a workover refers to the expensive process of pulling and replacing completion or production hardware in order to extend the life of the well. Reason to perform a workover Workovers rank among the most complex, difficult and expensive types of wellwork. They are only performed if the completion of a well is terminally unsuitable for the job at hand. The production tubing may have become damaged due to operational factors like corrosion to the point where well integrity is threatened. Downhole components such as tubing, retrievable downhole safety valves, or electrical submersible pumps may have malfunctioned, needing replacement. Workover Rig doing a Snub Job In other circumstances, the reason for a workover may not be that the completion itself is in a bad condition, but that changing reservoir conditions make the former completion unsuitable. For example, a high productivity well may have been completed with 5¬Ω\\" tubing to allow high flow rates (a narrower tubing would have unnecessarily choked the flow). Some years on, declining productivity means the reservoir can no longer support stable flow through this wide bore. This may lead to a workover to replace the 5¬Ω\\" tubing with 4¬Ω\\" tubing. The narrower bore makes for a more stable flow. Operation Before any workover, the well must first be killed. Since workovers are long planned in advance, there would be much time to plan the well kill and so the reverse circulation would be common. The intense nature of this operation often requires no less than the capabilities of a drilling rig. The workover begins by killing the well then removing the wellhead and possibly the flow line, then installing a B.O.P commonly known as a blowout preventer, then lifting the tubing hanger from the casing head, thus beginning to pull the completion out of the well. The string will almost always be fixed in place by at least one production packer. If the packer is retrievable it can be released easily enough and pulled out with the completion string. If it is permanent, then it is common to cut the tubing just above it and pull out the upper portion of the string. If necessary, the packer and the tubing left in hole can be milled out, though more commonly, the new completion will make use of it by setting a new packer just above it and running new tubing down to the top of the old. Workovers on casing Although less exposed to wellbore fluids, casing strings too have been known to lose integrity. On occasion, it may be deemed economical to pull and replace it. Because casing strings are cemented in place, this is significantly more difficult and expensive than replacing the completion string. If in some instances the casing cannot be removed from the well, it may be necessary to sidetrack the offending area and recomplete, also an expensive process. For all but the most productive well, replacing casing would never be economical.

Because of the exponential divergence of the nearby trajectories of chaotic systems, having two chaotic systems evolving in synchrony might appear surprising. However, synchronization of coupled or driven chaotic oscillators is a phenomenon well established experimentally and reasonably well-understood theoretically. The stability of synchronization for coupled systems can be analyzed using master stability. Synchronization of chaos is a rich phenomenon and a multi-disciplinary subject with a broad range of applications. Synchronization may present a variety of forms depending on the nature of the interacting systems and the type of coupling, and the proximity between the systems.  Identical synchronization  This type of synchronization is also known as complete synchronization. It can be observed for identical chaotic systems. The systems are said to be completely synchronized when there is a set of initial conditions so that the systems eventually evolve identically in time. In the simplest case of two diffusively coupled dynamics is described by :: x^{\\\\prime} = F(x) + \\\\alpha(y-x) :: y^{\\\\prime} = F(y) + \\\\alpha(x-y) where F is the vector field modeling the isolated chaotic dynamics and \\\\alpha is the coupling parameter. The regime x(t) = y(t) defines an invariant subspace of the coupled system, if this subspace x(t) = y(t) is locally attractive then the coupled system exhibit identical synchronization. If the coupling vanishes the oscillators are decoupled, and the chaotic behavior leads to a divergence of nearby trajectories. Complete synchronization occurs due to the interaction, if the coupling parameter is large enough so that the divergence of trajectories of interacting systems due to chaos is suppressed by the diffusive coupling. To find the critical coupling strength we study the behavior of the difference v = x - y. Assuming that v is small we can expand the vector field in series and obtain a linear differential equation - by neglecting the Taylor remainder - governing the behavior of the difference :: v^{\\\\prime} = DF(x(t)) v - 2 \\\\alpha v where DF(x(t)) denotes the Jacobian of the vector field along the solution. If \\\\alpha = 0 then we obtain :: u^{\\\\prime} = DF(x(t)) u, and since the dynamics of chaotic we have \\\\ u(t) \\\\ \\\\le \\\\ u(0) \\\\ e^{\\\\lambda t}, where \\\\lambda denotes the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the isolated system. Now using the ansatz v = u e^{-2 \\\\alpha t} we pass from the equation for v to the equation for u. Therefore, we obtain :: \\\\v(t) \\\\ \\\\le \\\\u(0)\\\\ e^{(-2 \\\\alpha + \\\\lambda) t} yield a critical coupling strength \\\\alpha_c = \\\\lambda/2, for all \\\\alpha > \\\\alpha_c the system exhibit complete synchronization. The existence of a critical coupling strength is related to the chaotic nature of the isolated dynamics. In general, this reasoning leads to the correct critical coupling value for synchronization. However, in some cases one might observe loss of synchronization for coupling strengths larger than the critical value. This occurs because the nonlinear terms neglected in the derivation of the critical coupling value can play an important role and destroy the exponential bound for the behavior of the difference. It is however, possible to give a rigorous treatment to this problem and obtain a critical value so that the nonlinearities will not affect the stability.Tiago Pereira, Stability of Synchronized Motion in Complex Networks, arXiv:1112.2297v1, 2011.  Generalized synchronization This type of synchronization occurs mainly when the coupled chaotic oscillators are different, although it has also been reported between identical oscillators. Given the dynamical variables (x1,x2, ...,xn) and (y1,y2, ...,ym) that determine the state of the oscillators, generalized synchronization occurs when there is a functional, Œ¶, such that, after a transitory evolution from appropriate initial conditions, it is [y1(t), y2(t),...,ym(t)]=Œ¶[x1(t), x2(t),...,xn(t)]. This means that the dynamical state of one of the oscillators is completely determined by the state of the other. When the oscillators are mutually coupled this functional has to be invertible, if there is a drive-response configuration the drive determines the evolution of the response, and Œ¶ does not need to be invertible. Identical synchronization is the particular case of generalized synchronization when Œ¶ is the identity. Phase synchronization Phase synchronization occurs when the coupled chaotic oscillators keep their phase difference bounded while their amplitudes remain uncorrelated. This phenomenon occurs even if the oscillators are not identical. Observation of phase synchronization requires a previous definition of the phase of a chaotic oscillator. In many practical cases, it is possible to find a plane in phase space in which the projection of the trajectories of the oscillator follows a rotation around a well-defined center. If this is the case, the phase is defined by the angle, œÜ(t), described by the segment joining the center of rotation and the projection of the trajectory point onto the plane. In other cases it is still possible to define a phase by means of techniques provided by the theory of signal processing, such as the Hilbert transform. In any case, if œÜ1(t) and œÜ2(t) denote the phases of the two coupled oscillators, synchronization of the phase is given by the relation nœÜ1(t)=mœÜ2(t) with m and n whole numbers. Anticipated and lag synchronization In these cases, the synchronized state is characterized by a time interval œÑ such that the dynamical variables of the oscillators, (x1,x2, ...,xn) and (x'1, x'2,...,x'n), are related by x'i(t)=xi(t+œÑ); this means that the dynamics of one of the oscillators follows, or anticipates, the dynamics of the other. Anticipated synchronization may occur between chaotic oscillators whose dynamics is described by delay differential equations, coupled in a drive-response configuration. In this case, the response anticipates the dynamics of the drive. Lag synchronization may occur when the strength of the coupling between phase-synchronized oscillators is increased.  Amplitude envelope synchronization  This is a mild form of synchronization that may appear between two weakly coupled chaotic oscillators. In this case, there is no correlation between phases nor amplitudes; instead, the oscillations of the two systems develop a periodic envelope that has the same frequency in the two systems. This has the same order of magnitude than the difference between the average frequencies of oscillation of the two chaotic oscillator. Often, amplitude envelope synchronization precedes phase synchronization in the sense that when the strength of the coupling between two amplitude envelope synchronized oscillators is increased, phase synchronization develops. All these forms of synchronization share the property of asymptotic stability. This means that once the synchronized state has been reached, the effect of a small perturbation that destroys synchronization is rapidly damped, and synchronization is recovered again. Mathematically, asymptotic stability is characterized by a positive Lyapunov exponent of the system composed of the two oscillators, which becomes negative when chaotic synchronization is achieved. Some chaotic systems allow even stronger control of chaos, and both synchronization of chaos and control of chaos constitute parts of what's known as \\"cybernetical physics\\".

Family background Dai≈°an was born in the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan as the second son of Nurhaci, the founder of the Qing dynasty. His mother was Nurhaci's first consort, Lady Tunggiya (‰Ωü‰Ω≥Ê∞è). He was an older half-brother of Nurhaci's successor, Hong Taiji. Career=Nurhaci's reign During Nurhaci's campaign against the Ula clan and its beile Bujantai in 1607, Dai≈°an distinguished himself on the battlefield by assisting ≈†urhaci and Cuyen. For his efforts, he was granted the title of \\"Guyen Baturu\\" () (literally: \\"exploring hero\\"). In 1613, Dai≈°an again distinguished himself on the battlefield in Nurhaci's campaign against the Ula clan. In 1616, when Nurhaci declared himself khan and established the Later Jin dynasty, Dai≈°an was the first selected as beile of a special rank by Nurhaci to assist in administration. These four beile would be known as the Four Senior Beiles the other places being filled by Amin, Mangg≈´ltai, and Hong Taiji . From 1618, when the campaign against the Ming dynasty began with the pronouncement of the Seven Grievances by Nurhaci, until 1622 Dai≈°an was a leading general and as captain of the Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners, played an important role in the capture of Fushun in 1618, in the victory at the Battle of Sarh≈´ in 1619, and in the occupation of Shenyang in 1621. Starting in 1621 Dai≈°an and the other three senior beiles served as assistants to Nurhaci on a monthly rotational basis in directing state affairs of the Later Jin dynasty. Hong Taiji's reign After the death of Nurhaci at the Battle of Ningyuan in 1626, Dai≈°an was able to use his influence to make the princes and generals come to an agreement on Hong Taiji's accession as khan. However even though Hong Taiji had become khan, Dai≈°an, along with Mangg≈´ltai and Amin continued to take turns as assistant administrators until 1629 as Hong Taiji began to consolidate power. Between 1629 and 1634, Dai≈°an took part in most of the campaigns of Hong Taiji against the Ming dynasty. In 1636, Hong Taiji declared himself emperor and renamed the Later Jin dynasty to \\"Qing dynasty\\". Dai≈°an was conferred the title of \\"Prince Li of the First Rank\\" (ÂíåÁ¢©Á¶ÆË¶™Áéã) and an additional title of \\"Elder Brother\\" (ÂÖÑ). Shunzhi Emperor's reign In 1643, Hong Taiji died and a successor was not named. At first, Dai≈°an named Hong Taiji's eldest son Hooge as the heir, but the latter declined the offer to succeed his father. Ajige and Dodo wanted Dorgon to take the throne, but Dorgon declined on the grounds that acceptance would be an act of disloyalty to the late emperor, who raised him. The issue was finally settled when many generals who followed Hong Taiji into battle declared that they wanted one of Hong Taiji's sons on the throne. As such, Hong Taiji's ninth son Fulin (the future Shunzhi Emperor), then at the age of six, was proclaimed emperor, with Dorgon and Jirgalang acting as co-regents. Yet even after the entire Qing court had swore an oath of allegiance to the throne, and there was a conspiracy by some nobles to let Dorgon replace Fulin. Dai≈°an settled the dispute by supporting Fulin and exposing the conspirators, which included his own son ≈†oto and his grandson Adali (eldest son of Sahaliyen). Dorgon and Dai≈°an had them both of them executed. Death and legacy According to historical records, it seemed that Dai≈°an never attempted to seize power for himself, and instead worked for the benefits of the Aisin Gioro clan. In 1643, he led a council of princes to appoint Jirgalang and Dorgon as co-regents for the Shunzhi Emperor. In 1644, he followed Dorgon to Beijing, where he died four years later. At the time of his death, special posthumous honours were not awarded to him, except that the sum of 10,000 taels instead of the usual 5,000 was given to his family for his funeral and a memorial tablet was erected. Later emperors of the Qing dynasty would come to recognise and appreciate the work he did for the dynasty and the imperial clan. The Kangxi Emperor awarded Dai≈°an a posthumous name, \\"Lie\\" (ÁÉà), in 1671. In 1754, the Qianlong Emperor ordered that Dai≈°an be given a place in the Temple of Princes at Mukden and in 1778, lauded him and Jirgalang, Dorgon, Hooge and Yoto for their illustrious accomplishments in the early days of the dynasty and ordered that their names be listed in the Imperial Ancestral Temple. At the same time the titles of these five, as well as those of Dodo, ≈†urhaci, and Lekedehun, were given rights of perpetual inheritance. The designation of Dai≈°an's title, which, after his death, had been twice altered under his son Mandahai and grandson Giyesu, was then restored to Prince Li, and the inheritor ranked higher in court ceremonies than any other prince. Dai≈°an had a total of eight sons. The seventh, Mandahai, inherited the rank of Prince of the First Rank, which was passed to his son. However, in 1659 the princedom was taken from Mandahai's descendants and given to Dai≈°an's grandson, Giyesu, whose descendants held it until the fall of the Qing dynasty. The eldest son, Yoto, was granted the title of \\"Prince Keqin of the Second Rank\\" (ÂÖãÂã§ÈÉ°Áéã) and the third, Sahaliyen, held the rank of \\"Prince Ying of the First Rank\\" (Á©éË¶™Áéã). Sahaliyen's son, Lekedehun, was named \\"Prince Shuncheng of the Second Rank\\" (È†ÜÊâøÈÉ°Áéã) in 1648. Dai≈°an's fourth son, Wakda, held the title of \\"Prince Qian of the Second Rank\\" (Ë¨ôÈÉ°Áéã). Wakda was canonised as Xiang (Ë•Ñ), but this title was not accorded the right of perpetual inheritance.

He claimed to be both the returned phase of Jesus Christ and the Antichrist; he was known for making statements that opposed the precepts of the Roman Catholic Church but that followed his interpretation of the Bible. He was previously known as el Jesucristo Hombre (which translates, roughly, to \\"the Man Jesus-Christ\\") but shortly after his death, his followers granted him the title of Melchizedek because, as stated by his official site, he attained his new and final name which means king of justice and king of peace. Footage from one of his sermons as well as an interview with comedian Bill Maher are included in the 2008 documentary film Religulous. Early life Jos√© Luis de Jes√∫s was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico to parents Antonio de Jes√∫s and Ana Luisa Miranda. He claimed that during his youth, he served stints in prison for petty theft because of the poor conditions that he was living on, and that he was already addicted to heroin at age 14. He stated that it was the \\"power of God what took me out of my drug addiction\\" and he soon joined a Baptist Church in his city. Creciendo en Gracia Jos√© Luis was promoted to minister after serving several years in the church. Miranda claims that in 1973, he had a vision in which he maintains that he was visited by a pair of angels. The impact on Miranda was significant; as he later told ABC News: \\"The same spirit that was in Jesus of Nazareth, and the same spirit is in me. He came to me. He [integrated] with my person in 1973.\\" It was not long before Miranda started preaching his own ideals and teachings. Jos√© Luis moved his then-wife Nydia and five children to South Florida, where he secured a 15-minute time slot from the radio station WVCG-AM to begin preaching. He started to assemble a select number of followers which culminated in the forming of Ministerio Creciendo en Gracia (Spanish for Growing in Grace) in 1988. At first, Jos√© Luis was only preaching according to the Four Gospels that narrate the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, but in 1998, he claimed that he was the reincarnation of Paul the Apostle and changed his focus into reading and preaching about Paul's gospel. Movement Outreach Creciendo en Gracia first started in Miami, Florida and soon expanded into different places in the United States and Latin America. On April 22, 2002, he married Josefina Torres, a woman that he met during one of his trips to Bogot√° in 1999. In 2005, he announced that he was the next phase of Jesus Christ on Earth and self-proclaimed Jesus Christ Man. In 2007, the Dallas Morning News reported that de Jes√∫s \\"preaches to followers in some 35 nations, mostly in Latin America, and has 287 radio programs and a 24-hour Spanish and English-language TV-network .\\" He claimed to have two million followers in 30 countries by 2008. Death On August 8, 2013, Miranda's ex-wife, Josefina Torres, claimed that Miranda had died in Sugar Land, Texas on August 8, 2013, apparently of cirrhosis of the liver. However, on September 11, Miranda reappeared in public, proclaiming himself in good health. On November 15, Miranda actually died in Orlando, Florida, with his death confirmed by both his movement and his family. Miranda's death has remained controversial among his followers. Publicly, his church has continued to insist that Miranda has not \\"died\\" and that he is immortal. He was buried on November 22, 2013 in a ceremony in which only his family and certain followers assisted. Beliefs=Antichrist In late 2006, he claimed that he was the Antichrist. He stated that the term was appropriate because people are no longer required to follow the \\"Jewish teachings\\" of Jesus of Nazareth, but rather to follow the apostle Paul's teachings through De Jes√∫s. According to de Jes√∫s, \\"Antichrist\\" means \\"no longer following Jesus of Nazareth as he lived in the days of his flesh\\". Followers showed their support by getting \\"666\\" tattoos on their bodies. One of Miranda's followers in Havana, Cuba tattooed the symbol on her three-year- old son. A YouTube video of the mother holding the child as he was tattooed was widely circulated in January 2013. \\"666\\", de Jes√∫s said, is not a sign of the devil (he preaches that the devil was destroyed) but instead is the number of the Antichrist and that the number is \\"a number of wisdom and it displays who is really following the truthful words of Jesus Christ\\". Christmas His followers celebrate Christmas each year on April 22, as this is the day de Jes√∫s was born and therefore they claim it is the \\"real\\" Christmas. Transformation According to his followers, there was to have been a Transformation day in which members would have supposedly been able to walk through walls and go through fire and not get burned, this because they would have been \\"fully enlightened and living with an immortal body\\". Jos√© Luis stated that his transformation and that of his followers would occur between June 30, 2012 and July 1, 2012 (sources Huffington Post and Miami New Times dispute the exact hour). Controversies=Divorce Jos√© Luis de Jes√∫s Miranda separated from his wife in 2007 because, according to her, \\"he started to say that he was God; I was not comfortable with that, so he threatened me by sending death-angels to my sons if I didn't do whatever he wanted\\". She also alleged that he liked to send her far away from home for long periods of time because \\"he was seeing other women, some of them from Creciendo en Gracia\\". Documents provided to the court by Josefina's attorney demonstrated that Jos√© Luis spent extravagantly during the time of the marriage, and used church funds to maintain his lifestyle. One gambling debt to Hard Rock Casino was over $46,000. Jo-Ann De Jes√∫s, Jos√© Luis' daughter and Church treasurer, testified that de Jes√∫s' first wife, Nydia V√©lez, receives $12,000 in monthly alimony paid for by the church. Finally, the church bought multiple properties for Jos√© Luis in Florida, Texas and Colombia using Church funds and signing the title over to Jos√© Luis or Jo-Ann De Jes√∫s. Roberto Pi√±eiro, the judge in charge of the divorce case, gave an unfavorable verdict towards de Jes√∫s in 2008 and, according to the Miami Herald, Josefina Torres received $2.2 million in properties and estates as compensation. Jos√© Luis stated afterwards that he sent \\"angels of fair retribution to seek for justice\\" against the judge. Roberto Pi√±eiro died on December 9, 2010 of a stroke, much to the delight of Miranda's followers. Disappearance of \\"Creciendo en Gracia\\" and groups emerged from this sect After the death of Jos√© Luis de Jes√∫s Miranda, the great majority of the followers did not want anything more to do with the sect, but some decided to remain united. However, because of the internal struggles for leadership and rival ambition of their leaders, after six months the group had already divided into four factions with different doctrinal positions and social agendas. As a result, it can be said that the sect really ended with the death of Jos√© Luis de Jes√∫s Miranda, and that the four factions, which have only retained a meager influence, constitute new movements. These are: * \\"La Amada de Jesucristo\\" (\\"The Beloved of Jesus Christ\\") or \\"Paloma\\" (\\"Dove\\"), directed by Andr√©s Cudris [Already deceased], * \\"La Ciencia de JH\\" (\\"The Science of JH\\"), directed by Emilio Gramajo, * \\"TV Gracia\\" (\\"Grace TV\\") directed by Luis Mart√≠n Gu√≠o, and * \\"Rey de Salem, El Gobierno de Dios, Melquisedec-Lisbeth\\" (\\"King of Salem, The Government of God, Melchizedec-Lisbeth\\"), directed by Lisbeth Garc√≠a (Widow of Jos√© Luis de Jes√∫s Miranda).

Early life Ingersoll was born on April 16, 1747 in Ridgefield in what was then called the Province of Connecticut, a part of British America. He was the son of Rev. Jonathan Ingersoll (1713‚Äì1778) and Dorcas (n√©e Moss) Ingersoll (1725‚Äì1811). His father was the chaplain for the Connecticut Troops during the French and Indian War.

Background During the pursuit of the French fleet after the battle of Barfleur, three of the most badly damaged French ships, the Soleil Royal (of 104 guns), Admirable (90 guns), and Triomphant (76 guns), accompanied by two frigates, of 24 and 20 guns, and a fireship, sought a safe haven at Cherbourg. They were beached outside the town, as there was no suitable harbour for them. Russell detailed Delaval, his vice-admiral, to attack and destroy them. Delaval took station off Cherbourg, and so many of the English fleet joined him that his command became unwieldy. Retaining just eleven of the ships with him, mostly the smaller 3rd and 4th Rates, he dispatched the rest, a further sixteen, to join Russell in pursuit of Tourville and the main body of the French fleet. Action Transferring from his flagship, Royal Sovereign of 100 guns to the handier St Albans of 50 guns, Delaval mounted his first attack on the morning of 21 May. The French had made serious efforts to protect the ships; they were beached with their masts seaward, to create an obstacle for the attackers, their guns were manned, and they were overlooked by shore batteries, Soleil Royal under the battery at Fosse du Galet, the other two further east under the guns of two coastal towers First attack Sending ships ahead to take soundings Delaval moved in on the morning of the 21st with St Albans and Ruby 50 to bombard the ships and the fort, but the French return fire was so fierce that after an hour and a half he was forced to retreat. Second attack On the morning of the 22nd Delaval tried again, sending the 50-gun St Albans and Advice to bombard the Admirable, while he himself, (now in Grafton of 70 guns), attacked the others, supported by Monk of 60 guns and a group of other 3rd and 4th Rates. However, Monk and her consorts had insufficient depth in the low tide to get in close, and were forced to retire. Third and final attack At one o'clock that afternoon, at high water, Delaval made a third attempt, this time using his fireships with boarding parties in boats. Soleil Royal was hit by fireship Blaze, her captain (Thomas Heath) bringing her within pistol-shot before firing and abandoning her, while Triomphant was burned by fireship Wolf, whose captain (James Greenway) laid her alongside before igniting her. However, the third fireship, Hound, was set alight by gunfire and burned before she reached Admirable, so Delaval led his boats in and boarded her. Beaujeu, her captain, and her crew were forced to abandon her, but about 40 of her crew, mostly wounded, were taken prisoner; the ship was burned, together with the two frigates and the fireship that were with her. Conclusion Delaval had achieved a clear success with few casualties, and at later that afternoon set off to rejoin the fleet at La Hogue. Ships English : 11 ships of the line, plus auxiliaries St Albans 50, Grafton 70, Burford 70, Advice 50, Monk 60,Ruby 50. French : 3 ships of the line, plus auxiliaries Soleil Royal 104, Admirable 90, Triomphant 76. Sources * Aubrey P: The Defeat of James Stuart's Armada 1692 (1979). .

Geography The suburb is bordered in the west by the Paterson River where the land is only approximately above mean sea level (AMSL) and undulating with a few small hills. This continues to the eastern extent of the suburb where the a range of hills begins, just before the border with Glen Oak. Heading north the land becomes progressively more hilly, with elevations ranging from common and with heights peaking at AMSL. The area is typically subdivided into residential lot sizes of with a number of larger properties fronting the Paterson River up to . Other properties at the top of Duns Creek Road have sweeping views of the Paterson and Hunter valleys and out to the Tasman Sea approximately away. The area consistently receives good, reliable rainfall and the countryside is largely green and lush throughout the year. Duns Creek has a population of 546 people with the Median age being 41. 3.8% of population idenfity has Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. 92.5% were born in Australia with 2.4 in England, 1.1% New Zealand, 0.6% in Scotland and 0.6% in Greece. 28.2% No Religin, 25.6% Catholic, 23.4% Anglican, 8.5% Not Stated and 4.6% United Church. 0.7% speak Greek and 0.3% speak Spanish. History Duns Creek's history is closely intertwined with the nearby village of Paterson, which was first surveyed in 1801. In December 1821 a grant of land to the south-west of the town was made to Captain Willian Dunn, after whom Duns Creek is named. Captain Dunn started a successful dairy farm which he called Duninald. It remained in family hands until 2005 when it was sold. The homestead on the farm is listed as a heritage item of both state and national significance. The suburb has seen subdivision of larger rural blocks since the 1980s and increasingly attracted a growing \\"treechange\\" population since the late 1990s. Most smaller rural holdings operate as hobby farms used for horse riding, olive and wine growing as well as other outdoor pursuits. Mahogany Ridge Resort development proposal On 30 June 2000 a development proposal for a A$45 million tourist resort at Mahogany Ridge in Duns Creek was lodged with Port Stephens Council. The proposal would have, at various times, increased the population of the area by up to 1,500 people, approximately five times the permanent population, and was strongly opposed by the local community and Port Stephens Council. After continued opposition for almost seven years the matter resulted in court action by both Port Stephens Council and the Commonwealth Government in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales and the proposal was finally defeated on 19 April 2007. The development has been replaced by a much smaller scale, upmarket rural residential subdivision. Location and amenities Duns Creek has good links to major Hunter urban centres. Maitland is less than 15 minutes drive and Newcastle can be reached within 50 minutes via Raymond Terrace. Other lifestyle attractions include Nelson Bay / Port Stephens (55-minute drive) and the Hunter Valley Wine Country centred on Pokolbin (55 minutes drive). It is in close proximity to the Tocal Agricultural College (5 minutes drive) which hosts its annual small farm fields days in May each year. Regular train services at Paterson Railway Station on CityRail's Hunter Line provide direct access to Maitland, Newcastle and Sydney. Newcastle Airport which has direct flights to Melbourne, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Canberra, is located 40 minutes drive to the east at Williamtown. Paterson, which is less than 5 minutes away by car, has all the facilities of a normal country town as well as a number of hotels, cafes and a golf course. The Woodville store, which is slightly further away, operates as a general store and post office. Both Paterson and Woodville each have long standing primary schools and other facilities including historic community halls. The privately owned sandstone 'All Saints' Church at Woodville is regularly used for wedding ceremonies and receptions. In 2006 the area was provided with ADSL internet connections and residents can now access the NBN. A daily mail service is provided to residents with parcels able to be picked up from the Woodville Store. Duns Creek also has a weekly garbage and recycling service provided by Port Stephens Council.

Saxl was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia.  Insulin production  In 1940, during World War II, she and her husband, Victor Saxl, fled to Shanghai, China. In Shanghai, a year later, Saxl was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941 the Japanese occupation of China was tightened, and soon all the pharmacies in Shanghai were closed. Saxl had no legal access to insulin. It was possible to buy insulin on the black market using one-ounce gold bars for payment. But that was not the safest option; one of Eva's friends died from using the black market insulin. Eventually, Victor and Eva decided to get insulin another‚Äîhighly unconventional‚Äîway: make it themselves. The book \\"Beckman's Internal Medicine\\" described the methods that Dr. Frederick Banting and Charles Best first used to extract insulin from the pancreases of dogs, calves, and cows in 1921. A Chinese chemist lent them a small laboratory in the basement of a municipal building, where they attempted to extract insulin from pancreata of water buffaloes. After much work, they finally produced a brown-coloured insulin. The insulin was tested on rabbits starved for twenty- four hours and then divided into two groups. One group was injected with the extracted mix, and the other with Eva's insulin. Without equipment to test the rabbits‚Äô urine or blood the best way Victor could test the potency of the insulin was to see if the rabbits experienced the same hypoglycaemic shock as the other rabbits. After testing the insulin on rabbits for more than a year, Eva was running out of conventional insulin and cautiously tried it on herself-‚Äìand it worked. In the Jewish ghetto where they were living, many other people with type 1 diabetes were also in dire need of insulin. Eva gave her insulin to two boys in a nearby hospital who were in diabetic comas. With a successful batch of homemade insulin, the Saxls began production of insulin for all people with diabetes in the Shanghai Ghetto. In all, over 200 people survived between 1941 and 1945 and there were no fatalities reported as a result of tainted insulin. The Saxls left Shanghai after World War II and emigrated to the United States. Eva and Elliott P. Joslin, MD, founder of today's Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, Massachusetts, befriended each other, and soon Dr. Joslin began inviting Eva to give lectures to groups of children and diabetes organizations. She became the first vocal spokesperson for juvenile diabetes. Her husband worked for the United Nations.  After WWII  In 1968, Victor Saxl died and Eva moved to Santiago, Chile to live with her brother, her only living relative. There she would remain vigilant as an advocate for people with diabetes. Eva Saxl died in 2002 in Santiago. The Saxls' story was dramatized by the 1956‚Äì1958 CBS television show Telephone Time in an episode titled \\"Time Bomb\\".

The usual meaning is 25 sheets of the same size and quality: of a ream of 500 sheets. Quires of 25 sheets are often used for machine-made paper, while quires of 24 sheets are often used for handmade or specialised paper of 480-sheet reams. (As an old UK and US measure, in some sources, a quire was originally 24 sheets.) Quires of 15, 18 or 20 sheets have also been used, depending on the type of paper. Nomenclature The current word \\"quire\\" derives from OE \\"quair\\" or \\"guaer\\", from OF \\"quayer\\", \\"cayer\\", (cf. modern Fr. cahier), from L. quaternum, \\"by fours\\", \\"fourfold\\". Later, when bookmaking switched to using paper and it became possible to easily stitch 5 to 7 sheets at a time, the association of \\"quaire\\" with \\"four\\" was quickly lost. History In the Middle Ages, a quire (also called a \\"gathering\\") was most often formed of 4 folded sheets of vellum or parchment, i.e. 8 leaves, 16 sides. The term \\"quaternion\\" (or sometimes quaternum) designates such a quire. A quire made of a single folded sheet (i.e. 2 leaves, 4 sides) is a \\"bifolium\\" (plural \\"bifolia\\"); a \\"binion\\" is a quire of two sheets (i.e. 4 leaves, 8 sides); and a \\"quinion\\" is five sheets (10 leaves, 20 sides). This last meaning is preserved in the modern Italian term for quire, quinterno di carta. Formerly, when paper was packed at the paper mill, the top and bottom quires were made up of slightly damaged sheets (\\"outsides\\") to protect the good quires (\\"insides\\"). These outside quires were known as \\"cassie quires\\" (from Fr. cass√©e, \\"broken\\"), or \\"cording quires\\" and had only 20 sheets to the quire. The printer William Caslon in a book published in 1770 mentions both 24- and 25-sheet quires; he also details printer's wastage, and the sorting and recycling of damaged cassie quires. An 1826 French manual on typography complained that cording quires (usually containing some salvageable paper) from the Netherlands barely contained a single good sheet.A note on the flyleaf of this copy states that this edition was pirated from Didot's 1st ed. of 1825; see pp. 235‚Äì236, especially in respect of the examples of proof- reader's corrections on pp. 162‚Äì163 It also became the name for any booklet small enough to be made from a single quire of paper. Simon Winchester, in The Surgeon of Crowthorne, cites a specific number, defining quire as \\"a booklet eight pages thick.\\" Several European words for quire keep the meaning of \\"book of paper\\": Ger. Buch von Papier, Dan. bog papir, Du. bock papier. In blankbook binding, quire is a term indicating 80 pages.  Ream 15 reams of paper A ream of paper is a quantity of sheets of the same size and quality. International standards organizations define the ream as 500 identical sheets.ISO 4046 (see References) defines the ream as \\"a pack of 500 identical sheets of paper\\" and appends a note: \\"In many countries it is common practice to use the term \\"ream\\" for other quantities, for example 480 sheets, thus affecting the quire. For quantities other than 500 sheets, a different term, such as \\"pack\\", should be used.\\" This ream of 500 sheets (20 quires of 25 sheets) is also known as a 'long' ream, and is gradually replacing the old value of 480 sheets, now known as a 'short' ream. Reams of 472 and 516 sheets are still current, but in retail outlets paper is typically sold in reams of 500. As an old UK and US unit, a perfect ream was equal to 516 sheets. Certain types of specialist papers such as tissue paper, greaseproof paper, handmade paper, and blotting paper are still sold (especially in the UK) in 'short' reams of 480 sheets (20 quires of 24 sheets). However, the commercial use of the word 'ream' for quantities of paper other than 500 is now deprecated by such standards as ISO 4046. In Europe, the DIN 6730 standard for Paper and Board includes a definition of 1 ream of A4 80gsm (80 g/m2) paper equals 500 sheets. Nomenclature The word 'ream' derives from Old French reyme, from Spanish resma, from Arabic rizmah \\"bundle\\" (of paper), from rasama, \\"collect into a bundle\\". (The Moors brought manufacture of cotton paper to Spain.) Early variant rym (late 15c.) suggests a Dutch influence.Online Etymology Dictionary (cf. Du. riem), probably during the time of Spanish Habsburg control of the Netherlands. History The number of sheets in a ream has varied locally over the centuries, often according to the size and type of paper being sold. Reams of 500 sheets (20 quires of 25 sheets) were known in England in c1594; in 1706 a ream was defined as 20 quires, either 24 or 25 sheets to the quire. In 18th- and 19th-century Europe, the size of the ream varied widely. In Lombardy a ream of music paper was 450 or 480 sheets; in Britain, Holland and Germany a ream of 480 sheets was common; in the Veneto it was more frequently 500. Some paper manufacturers counted 546 sheets (21 quires of 26 sheets). J.S. Bach's manuscript paper at Weimar was ordered by the ream of 480 sheets. In 1840, a ream in Lisbon was 17 quires and 3 sheets = 428 sheets, and a double ream was 18 quires and 2 sheets = 434 sheets; and in Bremen, blotting or packing paper was sold in reams of 300 (20 quires of 15 sheets). A mid-19th century Milanese-Italian dictionary has an example for a risma (ream) as being either 450 or 480 sheets. In the UK in 1914, paper was sold using the following reams: *472 sheets ‚Äì Mill ream (18 short quires of 24 sheets of 'insides', 2 cording quires of 20 sheets of 'outsides') *480 sheets ‚Äì (20 short quires of 24 sheets) ‚Äì now called 'short' ream (As an old UK and US measure, in some sources, a ream was previously equal to 480 sheets.) *500 sheets ‚Äì (20 quires of 25 sheets) ‚Äì now also called 'long' ream *504 sheets ‚Äì Stationer's ream (21 short quires) *516 sheets ‚Äì Printer's ream (21¬Ω short quires) ‚Äì also called 'perfect ream' Reams of 500 sheets were mostly used only for newsprint. Since the late 20th century, the 500-sheet ream has become the de facto international standard. Bundle A paper bundle is a quantity of sheets of paper, currently standardized as 1,000 sheets. A bundle consists of 2 reams or 40 quires. As an old UK and US measure, it was previously equal to 960 sheets. When referring to chipboard, there are two standards in the US. In general, a package of approximately 50 pounds of chipboard is called a bundle. Thus, a bundle of 22 point chipboard (0.022\\" thick) 24\\" √ó 38\\", with each sheet weighing 0.556 pounds, contains 90 sheets. However, chipboard sold in size 11\\" √ó 17\\" and smaller is packaged and sold as bundles of 25 pounds. Bale A paper bale is a quantity of sheets of paper, currently standardized as 5,000 sheets. A bale consists of 5 bundles, 10 reams or 200 quires. As an old UK and US measure, it was previously equal to 4800 sheets.

It is almost always installed as a vital component on the completion. Operation These valves are commonly uni-directional flapper valves which open downwards such that the flow of wellbore fluids tries to push it shut, while pressure from the surface pushes it open. This means that when closed, it will isolate the reservoir fluids from the surface. Most downhole safety valves are controlled hydraulically from the surface, meaning they are opened using a hydraulic connection linked directly to a well control panel. When hydraulic pressure is applied down a control line, the hydraulic pressure forces a sleeve within the valve to slide downwards. This movement compresses a large spring and pushes the flapper downwards to open the valve. When hydraulic pressure is removed, the spring pushes the sleeve back up and causes the flapper to shut. In this way, it is failsafe and will isolate the wellbore in the event of a loss of the wellhead. The full designation for a typical valve is 'tubing retrievable, surface controlled, subsurface safety valve', abbreviated to TR-SCSSV. Positioning The location of the downhole safety valve within the completion is a precisely determined parameter intended to optimise safety. There are arguments against it either being too high or too low in the well and so the final depth is a compromise of all factors. MMS regulations state that the valve must be placed no less than 100' below the mudline. Reasons to keep it high The further down the well the DHSV is located, the greater the potential inventory of hydrocarbons above it when closed. This means that in the event of loss of containment at surface, there is more fluid to be spilled causing environmental damage, or in the worst case, more fuel for a fire. Therefore, placing the valve higher limits this hazard. Another reason relates to the hydraulic control line. Hydraulic pressure is required to keep the valve open as part of the failsafe design. However, if the valve is too far down the well, then the weight of the hydraulic fluid alone may apply sufficient pressure to keep the valve open, even with the loss of surface pressurisation. Reasons to keep it low As part of the role of the DHSV to isolate the surface from wellbore fluids, it is necessary for the valve to be positioned away from the well where it could potentially come to harm. This implies that it must be placed subsurface in all circumstances, i.e. in offshore wells, not above the seabed. There is also the risk of cratering in the event of a catastrophic loss of the topside facility. The valve is specifically placed below the maximum depth where cratering is expected to be a risk. If there is a risk of methane hydrate (clathrate) plugs forming as the pressure changes through the valve due to Joule‚ÄìThomson cooling, then this is a reason to keep it low, where the rock is warmer than an appropriately- calculated temperature. Deploying and retrieving Most downhole safety valves installed as part of the completion design are classed as \\"tubing retrievable\\". This means that they are installed as a component of the completion string and run in during completion. Retrieving the valve, should it malfunction, requires a workover. The full name for this most common type of downhole safety valve is a Tubing Retrievable Surface Controlled Sub- Surface Valve, shortened in completion diagrams to TRSCSSV. If a tubing retrievable valve fails, rather than go to the expense of a workover, a \\"wireline retrievable\\" valve may be used instead. This type of valve can fit inside the production tubing and is deployed on wireline after the old valve has been straddled open. Legal requirement The importance of DHSVs is undisputed. Graphic images of oil wells in Kuwait on fire after the First Gulf War after their wellheads were removed, demonstrate the perils of not using the components (at the time, they were deemed unnecessary because they were onshore wells). It is, however, not a direct legal requirement in many places. In the United Kingdom, no law mandates the use of DHSVs. However, the 1974 Health & Safety at Work Act requires that measures are taken to ensure that the uncontrolled release of wellbore fluids is prevented even in the worst case. The brilliance of the act is that it does not issue prescriptive guideline for how to achieve the goal of health and safety, but merely sets out the requirement that the goal be achieved. It is up to the oil companies to decide how to achieve it and DHSVs are an important component of that decision. As such, although not a legal requirement, it is company policy for many operators in the UKCS. Issues While the DHSV isolates the production tubing, a loss of integrity could allow wellbore fluid to bypass the valve and escape to surface through the annulus. For wells using gas lift, it may be a requirement to install a safety valve in the 'A' annulus of the well to ensure that the surface is protected from a loss of annulus containment. However, these valves are not as common and they are not necessarily installed at the same position in the well, meaning it is possible that fluids could snake their way around the valves to surface.

He also played for the Redcliffe Dolphins in the Queensland Cup. Career Emmett made his NRL debut in Round 17 of the competition in 2006 after the NRL and QRL cleared him to play two days prior to kick-off following a suspension issue playing for feeder team Redcliffe. Emmett was rated as \\"up to NRL standard\\" by Wayne Bennett after holding his own in the baby Brisbane Broncos stunning win over Cronulla. Emmett played for the Broncos again in 2007 during the Origin period and went on to play a handful of first grade games post origin after the Broncos were hit hard by injuries in the latter part of the season. He scored one try in a game against eventual Premiers Melbourne. One of his worst nightmares came when, in the final round of the 2007 season, he dropped the ball with the line wide open against the Parramatta Eels, which the Broncos lost by a then record margin, 68-22. In a pre-season trial in 2008, Emmett injured his ankle and was sidelined for the early part of the season. He returned to the Broncos team for the game against Cronulla in round 10. He again played through the Origin period. He was also selected on the bench in a couple of games as a utility player, before dislocating his ankle in an awkward tackle in the Broncos round 18 loss to Canterbury. At first it was feared his ankle was broken but X-Rays cleared him of a break. Even so, he was sidelined for the rest of the season. Emmett was previously signed by the Parramatta Eels and played in the lower-grades for three years before being lured out of semi-retirement and returning to Queensland to play for Redcliffe.

A fortified manor house was recorded at Biddlestone in 1415 and a survey in 1541 disclosed a pele tower with a barmkin in good repair in the ownership of Percival Selby. In 1715 the house was described as in the ownership of Thomas Selby and comprised a cruciform four winged structure with a central battlemented tower. The family were Catholics with Jacobite sympathies. Ephraim Selby was involved in an uprising at Rothbury in 1715. In 1796 a later Thomas Selby replaced the old house with a much grander structure which became known as Biddlestone Hall. The new house was remodelled by architect John Dobson in 1820 to incorporate a private Catholic chapel. The Biddlestone estate was sold by Walter Selby to the Forestry Commission in 1914 and the Hall was demolished in 1957. The chapel however was preserved and still stands as a Grade II* listed building. The arms of the Selby family, (Barry of eight, or and sable), are depicted in stained glass in the chapel. Selby of Newcastle and Whitehouse Anthony Selby of Selby, Yorkshire moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland and his son Walter (b. 1444) married into the prominent Brandling of Newcastle family. Other marriages to Anderson and Fenwick further established the standing of the Selbys. George Selby (1506‚Äì1552) married Margaret Anderson. He was a Merchant Adventurer in Newcastle and a memorial to him stands in St Nicholas Church, Newcastle. Marriages between members of the different branches of the Selby family were not uncommon. In 1602 George Selby of Newcastle married Margaret Selby of Twizell Castle. In 1600 he became Mayor of Newcastle, an honour he received on three further occasions. He was knighted in 1606, was High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1608 and Deputy Lieutenant of the county in 1611. Shortly thereafter he acquired an estate at Whitehouse, Ryton, County Durham. He was elected Member of Parliament for Northumberland in 1614 but his election was rejected by the House of Commons as by then he had lost his residential and property owning qualification in Northumberland. He was appointed High Sheriff of Durham in 1624. George Selby (b. 1627) became the first of the Selby baronets in 1664 but the baronetcy was short-lived. It became extinct when both the first and second baronets died in the month of September 1688. Selby of Twizell Castle A pele tower at Branxton, Northumberland then in the county of Islandshire, owned by William Selby was destroyed by the Scots in 1496 and was rebuilt by his son John (d 1565). It did not remain the main family home as William had purchased Twizell Castle from Heron in 1520 and that estate was developed in preference to Branxton. John Selby was Gentleman Porter of Berwick Castle as was his son John who was knighted by Elizabeth I in 1582. Sir John Selby died in 1595 and an inventory was made of his goods at Twizell and elsewhere.William Greenwell, Wills and Inventories from the Registry at Durham, vol. 2 (Surtees Society, London, 1860), pp. 256-8. Sir John's son, Sir William Selby (d. 1612) was also Gentleman Porter of Berwick and Member of Parliament for that city in 1592, 1597, and 1601. Sir William inherited the Twizell estate on the death of his father in 1595 and also purchased the estate of Ightham Mote, in Kent in 1592. His estates went to his nephew William Selby (died 1638), and on his death his northern estate passed to his brother Sir Ralph Selby (d. 1646). Sir Ralph's granddaughter married a Selby cousin from Cornhill and Twizell remained with that junior branch until sold in 1685 to Sir Francis Blake. Selby of Ightham Mote, Kent Sir William Selby (d. 1611) of Twizell bought Ightham Mote in 1591 and on his death in 1611 bequeathed it to his nephew, also Sir William Selby (d. 1637) of Twizell Castle. In 1644 the estate came into the ownership of a nephew, George Selby of London, who was appointed High Sheriff of Kent in 1648. In the 18th century the estate passed via the female line when Dorothy Selby married John Browne. On the death of the 9th Viscount Montague in 1797 the Browne successors and descendant Thomas Selby of Ightham made an unsuccessful claim to the Viscountcy. The marriage of Lewis Marianne Selby of Beal into the Bigge family in 1833 led to the creation of Selby-Bigge ( see Selby-Bigge baronets) and the estate remained in the family until sold in 1889 to Sir T C Fergusson. In 1865 Elizabeth Selby of Ightham (1839‚Äì1906) married William Court Gully who upon accession to the Peerage took the title Viscount Selby. Selby of Beal Grindon Rigg, Northumberland was in the possession of Roger Selby in 1512 and John Selby in 1545. Oliver Selby, son of John, purchased half of the Manor of Beal, Northumberland in 1588 and land at neighbouring Lowlin in 1629. His brother William married Agnes Selby of Twizell Castle. The Selbys moved from Beal when George Selby (1724‚Äì1804) bought Twizell House,( not to be confused with Twizell Castle), Addestone, near Bambrough. His son Prideaux John Selby (1789‚Äì1867), was an eminent naturalist who improved the Twizell property and sold the Beal estate in 1850. His daughter Lewis Marianne married Charles Bigge (1803‚Äì1846) son of Charles William Bigge in 1833. After his death she remarried Robert Luard at Ightham Mote in 1850. For later descendants see Selby-Bigge baronets. Twizell House was demolished in 1969. Selby of Holy Island and Swansfield Richard Selby (d 1690) of Beal, purchased property on Holy Island in the 17th century. His grandson son George married a daughter of Prideaux Selby of Beal. A great grandson, also named Prideaux Selby (1747‚Äì1813) became a colonial administrator in Canada, Another great grandson Henry Collingwood Selby (d 1839) bought an estate at Swansfield, near Alnwick where he built Swansfield House to a design by architect John Dobson in 1823. The house was demolished in 1975. Selby also commissioned the Camphill Column, possibly as a reaction to locals thought to be supportive of the French Revolution. A later Prideaux Selby of Swansfield, a barrister, High Sheriff and Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland, was also of Pawston. Selby of Pawston Gerard Selby of Branxton, Northumberland purchased the neighbouring village of Pawston, Northumberland ( sometimes referred to as Paston) and built there a pele tower of which he was in occupation in 1541. The property was replaced with a manor house known as Pawston Hall in the 18th century. The Selbys prospered there for over three hundred years. By 1860 ownership of the estate had passed to the Beal/Holy Island branch of the family whose Prideaux Selby (1810‚Äì1872) had married in 1840 Sir Thomas Beauchamp-Proctor. On his death the estate passed to his son Beauchamp Proctor Selby .

Males have distinctly knobbed antennae, and although their jaws are somewhat larger than those of the females, they are nowhere near as large as those of many other male stag beetles. The lesser stag beetle is similar in appearance to the related antelope beetle (Dorcus parallelus) of North America. Adults are from in length. Like those of other stag beetles, the white, C-shaped larvae feed on wood. Adults as well as larvae are found in very soft decaying wood of broad-leaved trees, especially ash (Fraxinus excelsior), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and apple (Malus spp). Adults are active in summer and disperse by flying, and sometimes coming to outside lights. This is a widespread species in most of England and is generally common (except in the far north), coming into gardens wherever there are orchards, old hedges or large trees.

It provides researchers, teachers, and students easy and secure network access when visiting an institution other than their own. Authentication of users is performed by their home institution, using the same credentials as when they access the network locally, while authorization to access the Internet and possibly other resources is handled by the visited institution. Users do not have to pay for using eduroam. The service is provided at the local level by the participating institutions (universities, colleges, research institutes etc.). In some countries, Internet access via eduroam is also available at other locations than the participating institutions, e.g. in libraries, public buildings, railway stations, city centres (e.g. Aachen) and airports. In Belgium, Belnet uses the eduroam technology to provide a similar service to Belgian public administrations under the name govroam. A govroam service for municipalities in the Netherlands was launched in October 2013.  History  The eduroam initiative started in 2002 when during the preparations for the creation of TERENA's task force TF-Mobility Klaas Wierenga of SURFnet shared the idea of combining a RADIUS-based infrastructure with IEEE 802.1X technology to provide roaming network access across research and education networks. Initially the service was joined by institutions in the Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Portugal, Croatia and the United Kingdom. Later, other NRENs in Europe embraced the idea and started joining the infrastructure, which was then called eduroam. Since 2004, the European Union co-funded further research and development work related to the eduroam service through the GN2 and GN3 projects. From September 2007, the European Union also funded through these projects the continued operation and maintenance of the eduroam service at the European level. The first non-European country to join eduroam was Australia, in December 2004. In Canada, eduroam started as an initiative of the University of British Columbia, which was later taken over by CANARIE as a service of its Canadian Access Federation. In the United States, eduroam was initially a pilot project between the National Science Foundation and the University of Tennessee (UTK). In 2012, Internet2 announced the addition of eduroam to its NET+ service offerings. AnyRoam LLC, a private company, was formed by former UTK staff to serve as an Internet2 active corporate member administering the top-level servers.  Technology  The eduroam service uses IEEE 802.1X as the authentication method and a hierarchical system of RADIUS servers. The hierarchy consists of RADIUS servers at the participating institutions, national RADIUS servers run by the National Roaming Operators and regional top-level RADIUS servers for individual world regions. When a user visits a remote institution, the user's mobile device presents their credentials to the local RADIUS server. That RADIUS server discovers that it is not responsible for the realm of the user's home institution and proxies the access request to the national RADIUS server. If the visited institution is in a different country than the home institution, the request is in turn proxied to the regional top-level RADIUS server, and then to the national RADIUS server of the user's home country. That national server forwards the credentials to the home institution, where they are verified. The 'acknowledge' travels back over the proxy-hierarchy to the visited institution and the user is granted access. Because the user's credentials travel via a number of intermediate servers, not under the control of the home institution of the user, it is important that the credentials are protected. This requirement limits the types of authentication methods that can be used. Basically there are two categories of useful authentication methods: those that use credentials in the form of some public-key mechanism with certificates and those that use so-called tunnelled authentication. Most institutions use a tunnelled authentication method that only requires server certificates. These server certificates are used to set up a secure tunnel between the mobile device and the authentication server, through which the user credentials are securely transported. A complication arises if the user's home institution does not use a two-letter country-code top-level domain as part of its realm, but a generic top-level domain such as .edu or .org. By inspection of such realms, it is not possible to determine which national RADIUS server the request should be routed to. Such domains will thus by default fail to work in international roaming. The workaround for this problem involves the creation of exceptions in the international RADIUS request routing tables; however, this workaround does not scale as the number of exception entries grows. Several solutions have been proposed to eliminate this workaround in future, the most promising of which is RADIUS over TLS with Dynamic Discovery, which does not rely on static routing tables inside a RADIUS server configuration to route requests to their proper destination. Instead, the participating institution adds one single DNS resource record to its own domain's DNS zone which states by which server eduroam authentication for the domain is handled.  Governance  G√âANT has established a lightweight global governance structure. Recognising the large variety in the organisation and funding of research and education (networking) in different countries and regions, rules imposed on the operations of eduroam are limited to technical and administrative requirements that are necessary to ensure the smooth and secure operations of eduroam worldwide. Moreover, the eduroam operators have the leading role in creating and maintaining the rules of the global eduroam governance. The Global eduroam Governance Committee (GeGC) has the central role in the global eduroam governance structure. While its structure has evolved over time, it presently has three representatives from each of five regions ‚Äî mirroring those used by the Regional Internet registries ‚Äî serving a two year term. In addition, G√âANT may appoint one or more experts as non-voting members of the GeGC.  Geographical deployment  eduroam is available at selected locations in countries with a National Roaming Operator that has signed the eduroam Compliance Statement. Those sixty-seven countries are listed below. In addition, there may be pilot deployments in countries that are in the process of joining eduroam.  Europe  The NRENs that are members of the consortium of the GN3 project have joined the European eduroam confederation by signing the confederation's policy that requires its members to comply to a set of technical and organisational requirements, which are more specific than those in the global eduroam Compliance Statement. As a consequence, eduroam is deployed in the following countries: Austria (ACOnet), Belgium (Belnet), Bulgaria (BREN), Croatia (CARNet), Cyprus (CYNET), Czech Republic (CESNET), Denmark (NORDUnet, operated by DeIC), Estonia (EENet), Finland (NORDUnet, operated by FUNET), France (RENATER), Germany (DFN), Greece (GRNET), Hungary (NIIF), Iceland (NORDUnet, operated by RHnet), Ireland (HEAnet), Israel (IUCC), Italy (GARR), Latvia (SigmaNet), Lithuania (LITNET), Luxembourg (RESTENA), Macedonia (MARNET), Malta (University of Malta), Montenegro (MREN), Netherlands (SURFnet), Norway (NORDUnet, operated by UNINETT), Poland (PSNC), Portugal (FCCN), Romania (RoEduNet), Serbia (AMRES), Slovakia (SANET), Slovenia (ARNES), Spain (RedIRIS), Sweden (NORDUnet, operated by SUNET), Switzerland (SWITCH), Turkey (ULAKBIM), United Kingdom (Janet). In addition, three NRENs that are associate members of the consortium of the GN3 project without voting rights joined the European eduroam confederation; they represent Belarus (UIIP), Moldova (RENAM) and Russia (Joint Supercomputer Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences). Finally, five NRENs not involved in the GN3 project joined the European eduroam confederation on a voluntary basis, enabling the deployment of the service in Andorra (Universitat d'Andorra), Armenia (ASNET- AM), Azerbaijan (AzScienceNet), Kazakhstan (KazRENA) and Kyrgyzstan (KRENA). The European top-level RADIUS servers are operated by SURFnet and Forskningsnettet.  Asia-Pacific  eduroam is deployed in the following countries and economies: Australia (AARNet), China (CSTNET and CERNET), Hong Kong (Harnet), India (ERNET), Indonesia (UII), Japan (NII), Macau (University of Macau), Malaysia (MYREN), New Zealand (REANNZ), Fiji (Fiji National University), Saudi Arabia (KAUST), Singapore (SingAREN), South Korea (KREONET), Sri Lanka (Lanka Education and Research Network, University of Kelaniya, University of Moratuwa), Taiwan (Ministry of Education) and Thailand (UniNet). The Asia-Pacific top-level RADIUS servers are operated by AARNet and by the University of Hong Kong.  North America  eduroam is deployed in Canada (CANARIE) and the United States (Internet2, operated by ANYROAM LLC). It is also deployed in Mexico.

It is the only high school in the Starkville Oktibbeha Consolidated School District, serving grades 9-12\\\\. It offers more than 140 courses, including over 10 Advanced Placement courses. Its school colors are black and gold, and its mascot is the Yellowjacket, a predatory wasp. For the 2018‚Äì2019 academic year the graduation rate was 86.3% and the enrollment was 1,420. History A school was built for white students in 1899. The initial enrollment was 206, with an average attendance of 164. By 1910 the enrollment had grown to 312 and the average attendance to 270, due both to the increased number of residents and the superiority of the school causing county residents to choose to attend there. The county paid the city more than the cost of attendance, and so helped fund the school. There were too few desks, and the auditorium was of insufficient size, so a new school building was proposed. The negro school was deemed unsuitable for occupation, and $3,500 was allocated to build a new black school, in addition to the $2.00 per student provided by the state and the $200 generated by the negro poll tax. Prior to 1970, separate schools were maintained for white and black students. In 1970, the federal government mandated the integration of the two systems. Starkville High became the home for all students in grades 9-12, while the former high school for black students, Henderson became the junior high school. In 1969, Starkville Academy was founded as a segregation academy on property adjacent to Starkville High for parents of white children who wished to keep their children in segregated schools. In 2015 the schools of Oktibbeha County School District consolidated into the Starkville district. Two high schools, East High and West High, consolidated into Starkville High; this added about 300 students to Starkville High.\\"The Plan for Starkville Oktibbeha Consolidated School District .\\" Starkville Oktibbeha Consolidated School District.

Only Fanny Foley Herself was completed and released in Technicolor. The titles of the two other features were Marcheta and Bird of Paradise. Marcheta seems to have been abandoned, while Bird of Paradise was changed into a black-and-white production starring Dolores del R√≠o and Joel McCrea *This was Edna May Oliver's first appearance in color. She would appear in color only once more, in the 1939 film Drums Along the Mohawk. She did not appear in the Technicolor sequences of The American Venus (1926). *This was Helen Chandler's only appearance in a color film. She did not appear in the color sequences of Radio Parade of 1935 (1934). She may have appeared in the color sequences of the silent film The Joy Girl (1927). This film, rumored to exist at the Museum of Modern Art, is unavailable for inspection. Reception In October 1931 The New York Times said \\"There are greenish skies, steel-tinted nights, amber lights, frocks and gowns of pastel shades, most of this prismatic work being quite well done. But whether it is, on the whole, more effective than black and white is a matter of opinion.\\" Preservation status The film is now considered to be a lost film. But a Trailer Survives 200 ft.

History  When Libya gained its independence in 1951, veterans of the original Sanusi Army formed the nucleus of the Royal Libyan Army.Library of Congress Country Study: Libya, 1988 Though the Libyan army has a large amount of fighting equipment at its disposal, the vast majority was bought from the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s and was largely obsolete at the time of the Libyan civil war. A high percentage remains in storage and a large amount of equipment has also been sold to various African countries. The Libyan Army was generally regarded as neither efficient nor well trained.  Libyan Arab Jamahiriya period  From the late seventies to the mid to late eighties the army was involved in four major incursions into Chadian Territory. The Libyan Army suffered great losses in these conflicts especially that of the Toyota War of 1987 largely due to poor tactics and western aid to Chad. All of these incursions were eventually repulsed and Libya no longer occupies Chad. This conflict was known as the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict. In February 2011, the Libyan civil war broke out and several units of the army mutinied and defected to the opposition, with battles taking place across much of the country. In September 2011, the pre-civil war Libyan army had been effectively destroyed by a combination of NATO air strikes and combat with rebel forces, with the Libyan army forces still loyal to Gaddafi abandoning their posts in Tripoli as the rebels took the city, and the remnants of Gaddafi's loyalist army holed up in Sirte, Sabha and Bani Walid.  Strength  In 2009 the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated that the Ground Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya numbered 25,000 with an additional, estimated, 25,000 conscripts (total estimated 50,000). The IISS estimated that the Ground Forces were organised into 11 Border Defence and 4 Security Zones, one regime security brigade (the 32nd Khamis Brigade), 10 Tank Battalions, 10 Mechanised Infantry Battalions, 18 Infantry Battalions, 6 Commando Battalions, 22 Artillery Battalions, 4 Surface-to-Surface missile Brigades and 7 Air Defence Artillery Battalions.IISS, The Military Balance 2009, p. 256 Doctrine is a mixture of Egyptian doctrine which was adopted after the 1969 coup and socialist principles derived from the concepts of a People‚Äôs Army.  Equipment  In the 1980s and 90s the high technological level of its huge amount of equipment demanded a level of technical competence in operation and maintenance that the Libyan Army lacked. Maintenance and repair problems were exacerbated by the diversity of arms sources. The numerous foreign advisers and technicians were insufficient to overcome low standards of support and logistics. Recent years saw the Army undermined by the embargo, which deprived it of new weapons and caused major problems with equipment maintenance. In the 1990s Western agencies intercepted numerous shipments of spare parts and dual-use material being smuggled to Libya. After many years of sanctions, all major areas of the land forces equipment needed improvement, especially the replacement of obsolete main battle tanks and artillery. Over half of Libya's armoured forces were thought to be in storage due to the chronic shortage of spare parts and obsolescence.  Tanks  The IISS estimated tank numbers in 2009 as 20,025 (not including those proven to have been captured/destroyed by rebels during the Libyan civil war as of 6 June 2011): 150 T-72; 115 in store; 100 T-62; 4620 in store; 5000 T-55; 10,040 T-54/T-55 in store. The IISS estimated there were 500 BRDM-2 and 700 EE-9 Cascavel reconnaissance vehicles, 1000 BMP-1s, plus BMD-1s.IISS 2009 Russian official sources reported in 2010 that T-72s would be modernized with help from Russia.Russia to upgrade 200 Soviet-era tanks for Libya 540 BTR-50 and BTR-60s were also reported by the IISS.

Anti-air weapons  In 2009 the IISS estimated that Libya had Crotale, SA-7 Grail, SA-9/SA-13 surface-to-air missiles, and AA guns in Army service. A separate Air Defence Command has SA-2, SA-3, SA-5 Gammon, and SA-8b Gecko, plus guns. Many of Libya's air defence systems were destroyed during the civil war,http://www.channel4.com/news/libya-gaddafi- base-hit-in-second-night-of-allied-bombing how much, if any, remained intact afterwards is unknown.

Combat experience  A sharp series of border clashes occurred with Egypt in 1977, and Libyan forces were flown into Uganda in 1978 in an unsuccessful effort to defend Idi Amin's Uganda against invading Tanzanian forces. In addition, the Libyans conducted a series of campaigns in Northern Chad since 1980, launching a campaign against Chad that year and again in 1983. In April 1987, Libya suffered a disastrous defeat in Chad, losing nearly a quarter of its invasion force.  Egypt  On 19 July 1977, after a protest march by Libyans was stopped by Egyptian border guards, Libyan artillery units fired into Egypt. After further border violations were alleged by both sides, fighting escalated on the same day with an artillery duel, and, two days later, a drive along the coast by Egyptian armor and infantry during which the Libyan army was engaged. Egypt claimed successful surprise air strikes against the Libyan air base at Al Adem, just south of Tobruk, and surface-to-air missile batteries and radar stations were knocked out as well. When the Egyptians withdrew on 24 July, most foreign analysts agreed that the Egyptian units had prevailed, although Libyan forces responded more effectively than had been expected. Libyan army hailed the encounter as a victory, using the fight as a justification for further purchases of modern armaments.  Uganda  In the case of Uganda, Libya had intervened on Idi Amin's behalf during his first confrontation with neighboring Tanzania in 1972 by airlifting a contingent of 4000 troops. During the invasion of Uganda by Tanzanian troops and Ugandan exiles in 1978, a new Libyan force estimated at 2,000 to 2,500 was sent, assisting in the defence of Entebbe and Kampala by covering road junctions with armored equipment. Unprepared and undermotivated Libyan troops were quickly routed in attacks by foot soldiers. As many as 600 Libyans were estimated to have been killed during the Ugandan operation, and the remainder were hurriedly withdrawn. The troops had been led to believe that they were being airlifted into Uganda for training exercises with Ugandan units.  Chad  After nearly two decades, Col. Muammar Gaddafi's attempts to annex Northern Chad ended in 1987. In just the first three months of 1987, Libya lost almost all the territory it had held in Chad, between $500 million and $1 billion in weapons and one-third of its 15,000 troops. Over 4,494 Libyan soldiers were killed by Chad's forces between January and March 1987. The Libyan Army was defeated by a force substantially inferior in numbers and equipment. Chad's victory was the result of a combination of Western funding, weapons and intelligence and Chadian courage, tactics and leadership. France provided air cover and troops to protect the Chadian rear areas, while the USA provided $240 million in equipment and weapons. The U.S. also contributed $75 million in emergency military aid, including transport aircraft and air defence systems. The Chad forces displayed some remarkable tactical innovations: they used Toyota all- terrain vehicles, lightly armored French-made Panhard cars, and Milan antitank and Stinger antiaircraft missiles to destroy Libyan tanks and planes. Libyan civil war  People on a tank in a Benghazi rally, 23 February 2011 Palmaria heavy howitzers of the Libyan Army, destroyed by French airplanes close to the west-southern border of Benghazi, Libya, 19 March 2011 In 2011 protests against the rule of Gaddafi started in Libya. They were inspired by similar protests in other Arab countries. Gaddafi used police and mercenary forces to violently suppress the protest. This resulted in an armed uprising in Libya between pro-government and anti-government forces. Parts of the army joined the rebels and weapon depots were plundered by protesters. After initial advances by the rebels, the Libyan Army began a counteroffensive and started pushing back the rebel fighters. On 17 March 2011, the United Nations Security Council passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, authorizing the use of \\"all necessary means\\" to protect civilians in Libya, \\"excluding a foreign occupation force\\". On Saturday, 19 March 2011, France began enforcement of the resolution by deploying French fighter aircraft over Libyan airspace. *First Battle of Benghazi 17‚Äì20 February *Tripoli clashes 17‚Äì25 February *Battle of Misrata 18 February ‚Äì 15 May *First Battle of Zawiya 24 February ‚Äì 10 March *2011 Nafusa Mountain Campaign 1 March ‚Äì 18 August *First Battle of Brega 2 March *Battle of Ra's Lanuf 4‚Äì12 March *Battle of Bin Jawad 6 March *Second Battle of Brega 13‚Äì15 March *Battle of Ajdabiya 15‚Äì26 March *Second Battle of Benghazi 19‚Äì20 March *First Gulf of Sidra offensive 26‚Äì30 March *Third Battle of Brega 31 March ‚Äì 7 April *Cyrenaican desert campaign 3 April - 12 June *Battle of Brega‚ÄìAjdabiya road 8 April ‚Äì 21 May *Battle of Wazzin 20 April - 29 July *Battle of the Misrata frontline 16 May ‚Äì 19 August *2011 Sabha clashes 8‚Äì13 June *Zliten uprising 9‚Äì16 June *Zawiya raid 11‚Äì12 June *Battle of Zliten 21 July ‚Äì 19 August *Fourth Battle of Brega 14 July ‚Äì 22 August *Fezzan campaign 17 July ‚Äì 27 September *2011 Msallata clashes 3‚Äì9 August *Battle of Tawergha 11‚Äì13 August *Battle of Gharyan 13‚Äì18 August *Second Battle of Zawiya 13‚Äì20 August *2011 Ras Ajdir clashes 13‚Äì26 August *2011 Libyan rebel coastal offensive 13‚Äì28 August *Douz skirmish 19‚Äì20 August *Battle of Tripoli 20‚Äì28 August *Second Gulf of Sidra offensive 22 August - 20 October (End of the Libyan civil war) *Battle of Bani Walid 9 September - 17 October *Battle of Sirte 20 October  References  Further reading  * Kenneth M.

The simplest such process is a Poisson process where the time between each arrival is exponentially distributed. The processes were first suggested by Neuts in 1979. Definition A Markov arrival process is defined by two matrices D0 and D1 where elements of D0 represent hidden transitions and elements of D1 observable transitions. The block matrix Q below is a transition rate matrix for a continuous-time Markov chain. : Q=\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} D_{0}&D;_{1}&0&0&\\\\dots\\\\ 0&D;_{0}&D;_{1}&0&\\\\dots\\\\ 0&0&D;_{0}&D;_{1}&\\\\dots\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right]\\\\; . The simplest example is a Poisson process where D0 = ‚àíŒª and D1 = Œª where there is only one possible transition, it is observable and occurs at rate Œª. For Q to be a valid transition rate matrix, the following restrictions apply to the Di :\\\\begin{align} 0\\\\leq [D_{1}]_{i,j}&<\\\\infty \\\\ 0\\\\leq [D_{0}]_{i,j}&<\\\\infty \\\\quad i eq j \\\\ \\\\, [D_{0}]_{i,i}&<0 \\\\ (D_{0}+D_{1})\\\\boldsymbol{1} &= \\\\boldsymbol{0} \\\\end{align} Special cases= Markov-modulated Poisson process  The Markov- modulated Poisson process or MMPP where m Poisson processes are switched between by an underlying continuous-time Markov chain. If each of the m Poisson processes has rate Œªi and the modulating continuous-time Markov has m √ó m transition rate matrix R, then the MAP representation is :\\\\begin{align} D_{1} &= \\\\operatorname{diag}{\\\\lambda_{1},\\\\dots,\\\\lambda_{m}}\\\\ D_{0} &=R-D_1. \\\\end{align} Phase-type renewal process The phase-type renewal process is a Markov arrival process with phase-type distributed sojourn between arrivals. For example, if an arrival process has an interarrival time distribution PH(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha},S) with an exit vector denoted \\\\boldsymbol{S}^{0}=-S\\\\boldsymbol{1}, the arrival process has generator matrix, : Q=\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} S&\\\\boldsymbol{S}^{0}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}&0&0&\\\\dots\\\\ 0&S;&\\\\boldsymbol{S}^{0}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}&0&\\\\dots\\\\ 0&0&S;&\\\\boldsymbol{S}^{0}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}&\\\\dots\\\\ \\\\vdots&\\\\vdots&\\\\ddots&\\\\ddots&\\\\ddots\\\\ \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right] Batch Markov arrival process The batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP) is a generalisation of the Markovian arrival process by allowing more than one arrival at a time. The homogeneous case has rate matrix, : Q=\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} D_{0}&D;_{1}&D;_{2}&D;_{3}&\\\\dots\\\\ 0&D;_{0}&D;_{1}&D;_{2}&\\\\dots\\\\ 0&0&D;_{0}&D;_{1}&\\\\dots\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right]\\\\; . An arrival of size k occurs every time a transition occurs in the sub-matrix D_{k}.

The Longburn Railway Station was the northern terminus of New Zealand's most prominent and successful private railway, the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company. The line between Longburn and Wellington was completed in 1886 and at Longburn, passengers and goods transferred between the Wellington and Manawatu Railway and the New Zealand Railways Department network. On 8 December 1908, the Wellington and Manawatu was absorbed into the New Zealand Railways, and Longburn lost its significant interchange status. However, the Foxton Branch was retained until it closed in 1959. The branch line resulted in the official name of the station changing from Long Burn to Longburn Junction. The name was adopted by the Junction Hotel opposite the station. The line through Longburn is now part of the North Island Main Trunk railway. In an attempt to attract growth to the Manawatu region, the Manawatu District Council agreed to cede part of its territory to Palmerston North City. However, Longburn was a part of this only to the eastern side of the North Island Main Trunk Railway, effectively cutting the settlement in half.

Originally working solely in Tamil Nadu, People's Watch has recently moved into working at a national level with funding provided by the European Union and other donor agencies for the National Project on the Prevention of Torture in India. People's Watch is widely recognised as the leading Human Rights organisation in India. From 1995-98, People's Watch concentrated its activities on monitoring of human rights violations. This was the mandate of its governing body and the Program Advisory Board. It was soon realized that monitoring alone was insufficient. In 1998, People's Watch began legal intervention on behalf of victims. By 2000, this work had grown and more field monitoring associates were hired at both zonal and regional levels. By 2001, People's Watch was working in 11 areas of Tamil Nadu. Soon after, the need to launch a full-fledged awareness building Campaign for Human Rights became clear, and this was followed, soon afterward, by the realization that victim rehabilitation was also essential. Monitoring, intervention and even winning compensation from the courts was not enough for those who had survived torture, abuse and imprisonment. They desperately needed medical, psychological and vocational help as well. Preceding the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education, People's Watch began a vigorous training and education program. Building on a mandate to monitor violations the growth and development of a broad range of individuals People's Watch initiated in committed to, knowledgeable and skilled in human rights work, 1997‚Äì98, the first Human Rights Education program in nine Tamil Nadu schools in 9th standard. By 2002-2005, standards 6-9th were involved in human rights education in nearly 800 schools, and teachers and students alike were reporting extraordinary classroom interest and enthusiasm. The need for human rights education at the college level was clear, as was the need to reach law students, movements, other NGOs, professional groups, elected representatives, trade unions, political parties and the media. By 2004, when the Strategic Planning process began, People's Watch had developed into a highly respected, effective NGO, making connections, facilitating programs and spreading both a heightened awareness and an imperative to be an agent for change. People's Watch is a member organization of the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA).

Also known as Castle House, Lisgar House, or simply 'The Castle', the country house was located just to the south-west of Castle Lough in what is now known as Bailieborough Demesne, on the north-western edge of the town. It is now totally demolished. Castle Lake loop is a hiking trail around part of the former castle's property. History William Bailie, a Scottish \\"undertaker\\" or Planter, was granted the lands of Tonergie (Tandragee) in East Breffnie by James I in 1610 on condition he enclosed a demesne, built a fortified house and settled on the estate a number of Scottish or English families. This he did by 1629. During the rising of 1641 the house was attacked and occupied for a month by a troop of Irish soldiers under Colonel Hugh O‚ÄôReilly. William died c.1648 and the estate passed to his son, William, the Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh. On the bishop's death in 1664 the estate was inherited by his only daughter, who had married James Hamilton. James was succeeded by his son Henry, the M.P. for Cavan who was killed at the siege of Limerick during the Jacobite war. His successor was his son, another James Hamilton, who sold the property in 1724 to Major Charles Stewart - nephew and co-heir of General William Steuart - and left the area. Charles Stewart died in 1740 and left the estate to his son, William Stewart, who was High Sheriff of Cavan for 1749 and MP for Cavan county (1766‚Äì1768). He was followed by his son Charles, who was also MP for Cavan (1783‚Äì1793). He was killed in an accident in 1795, when the estate passed to a nephew, Thomas Charles Stewart Corry, who sold it to Colonel William Young in 1814. Colonel Young laid out the town of Bailieborough in its present location and was made 1st Baronet Young of Bailieborough in 1821. He died in 1835 and was succeeded by his son John Young, 1st Baron Lisgar, who was at one time Chief Secretary for Ireland and, at a later date, Governor General of Canada. He was made 1st Baron Lisgar in 1870 and in his retirement renovated the house. After Lady Lisgar's death in 1895 the estate went into Chancery and some of the land was sold to the tenants under the Ashbourne Act. The house itself was sold to Sir Stanley Cochrane, who later sold it to one of his nephews, the late Mr. W.L.B. Cochrane, a Bailieborough solicitor. The bulk of the land was sold in 1910 to the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands. In 1915 the house and the remaining 100 acres of land were sold to a religious order, the Marist Brothers of Athlone. Several of the brothers lie buried in a walled enclosure in the vicinity. In 1918 the house burnt down and although the brothers continued in a rebuilt section until 1936, they then decided to sell the house to the Department of Lands and leave. The house was demolished soon after.

He was the ninth son of the Kangxi Emperor and an ally of his eighth brother Yunsi, who was the main rival to their fourth brother Yinzhen in the power struggle over the succession. In 1722, Yinzhen succeeded their father and became historically known as the Yongzheng Emperor, after which he started purging his former rivals. In 1725, the Yongzheng Emperor stripped Yuntang off his beizi title, banished him from the Aisin Gioro clan, and imprisoned him in Baoding. Yuntang died under mysterious circumstances later. In 1778, the Qianlong Emperor, who succeeded the Yongzheng Emperor, posthumously rehabilitated Yuntang and restored him to the Aisin Gioro clan. Life Yintang was born in the Aisin Gioro clan as the ninth son of the Kangxi Emperor. His mother was Consort Yi (ÂÆúÂ¶É) from the Gorolo clan. He was not one of the Kangxi Emperor's favourite sons, but nonetheless managed to gain substantial wealth and influence among his brothers. The Kangxi Emperor had designated his second oldest surviving son, Yinreng, as Crown Prince, but had also stripped Yinreng from his position twice due to Yinreng's arrogance and violent behaviour. During that two periods of time when the position of Crown Prince was vacant, Yintang supported his eighth brother, Yinsi, in his bid to secure that position, but Yunsi did not succeed both times. The Kangxi Emperor eventually decided to secretly designate an heir apparent, whose identity would only be revealed after his death. In 1722, after the Kangxi Emperor died, his fourth son, Yinzhen, was revealed to be his chosen successor. Yinzhen ascended the throne and became historically known as the Yongzheng Emperor. Yintang and all his brothers had to change the character Yin (ËÉ§) in their names to Yun (ÂÖÅ) to avoid naming taboo, because the reigning emperor's name also contained the character Yin. In the same year, Yuntang was sent to the military garrison at Xining and placed under the supervision of the general Nian Gengyao. Three years later, in 1725, the Yongzheng Emperor stripped Yuntang off his beizi title, banished him from the Aisin Gioro clan, and forced him to change his name to \\"Seshe\\" (Manchu: ; ). His eight sons were forced to change their name to Fusih≈´n, Facuh≈´n, Ubiyada, Eimede, Hairakan, Dungki, Dusihiyen and Eihun respectively. Yuntang reportedly pleaded with the emperor to send him to a Buddhist monastery and allow him to spend the rest of his life as a monk, but the emperor refused. Yuntang was later imprisoned in Baoding. He died from an unspecified \\"abdominal illness\\". However, there are speculations that Yuntang died from poisoning. In 1778, Yuntang was posthumously rehabilitated by the Qianlong Emperor, who had succeeded the Yongzheng Emperor in 1735. Yuntang was restored to the Aisin Gioro clan and had his name changed back from \\"Seshe\\" to \\"Yuntang\\". Meaning of \\"Seshe\\" \\"S√†isƒ´hƒìi\\" is a Chinese transliterating words of a Manchu term which has traditionally been translated as \\"dog\\" in Chinese. However it is a false rumour. According to Hei tu dang (ÈªëÂõæÊ°£), a Manchu script document now kept in Liaoning Provincial Museum, the original term is \\"Seshe\\" (). There is some dispute as to whether that is an accurate translation. Some scholars suggest \\"Seshe\\" actually means \\"to tremble\\", or \\"annoying person\\". Legacy Yuntang has been viewed as a pioneer in the romanisation of the Manchu language. He was known to have had ties with the Portuguese missionary Joannes Mour√£o (Á©ÜÊôØÈÅ†). Mour√£o allegedly introduced Yuntang to literature written in the Latin alphabet, which allowed Yuntang to establish a basic Manchu romanisation system around 1723, supposedly as a secret code for communication between himself and other supporters of Yunsi. While Paul Georg von M√∂llendorff's M√∂llendorff system is often seen as the first Manchu transliteration system, Yuntang's system predates M√∂llendorff's by over 150 years.

Initially he ruled the city with his uncle Francesco, but in 1332 the two were ousted by a Papal Army, remaining in control of Forlimpopoli only. The following year, however, he became the Ghibelline leader in Romagna, receiving the seigniories of Cesena and Bertinoro and establishing a firm rule on Forl√¨. In 1337 Francesco imprisoned the Archbishop of Ravenna and was excommunicated by the Pope Benedict XII: however, the struggle ended with the Ordelaffi victorious, since the Pope named him vicar of Forl√¨, Cesena and Folimpopoli, in exchange of an annual payment. The excommunication was later renewed when he sided for Emperor Louis IV of Bavaria in order to avoid the tribute, being named imperial vicar. Around 1347 he hosted Giovanni Boccaccio in Forl√¨. In 1350 Francesco conquered Bertinoro, Meldola, Fontanafredda and Ghiaggiolo, but had to face the opposition of the strong Papal general Gil de Albornoz, supported by the Malatesta of Rimini, as well as another excommunication. Despite the strong resistance of his wife Cia degli Ubaldini and his son Ludovico, Cesena fell on June 21, soon followed by Bertinoro. Francesco and Forl√¨ fell on July 4, 1359, and he was to content of the title of vicar of Forlimpopoli and Castrocaro thenceforth. Later he fought for Bernab√≤ Visconti against the Papal armies, and tried unsuccessfully to reconquer Forl√¨. He died in Venice in 1374. His son Sinibaldo was later lord of Forl√¨.

Carden logo Sir John Carden was a prolific designer who went on to work on tanks but started his career with cyclecars. His first design was a wooden bodied single seater powered by a 481 cc single cylinder JAP engine driving the back axle by belt. There was no gearbox. At first he had built the cars at his home but demand was sufficient to warrant moving to larger premises in Teddington in February 1914. Carden cyclecar In October 1914 Motor Cycle magazineMotor Cycle Magazine, 8 October 1914, p407 reported on a Carden Monocar they had on trial. This vehicle (registration MXY1) was powered by an air-cooled 5HP V-twin JAP engine, and had only a single gear, though gears were available on 'other models'. The engine was mounted behind the rear axle and drove it via chain, there being no differential. The optional gear change was a mechanism whereby one chain sprocket was disengaged and another moved to drive the chain. In 1916 the design and factory was sold to Ward and Avey Ltd who renamed the car the AV and continued manufacture until about 1924. Production, including those made by AV, may have reached 1000. Carden went on to design a new cyclecar in 1919 which he sold later the same year to Tamplin and then a further model which he sold to Arnott and Harrison in 1922 who sold it as the New Carden and made the car until 1925.

Science Week is an initiative of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) It is the largest science festival in the country, engaging tens of thousands of members of the general public in workshops, science shows, talks, laboratory demonstrations, science walks and other science-related events. Science Week is a collaboration of events involving industry, colleges, schools, libraries, teachers, researchers and students throughout Ireland. Science Week supports Science Foundation Ireland‚Äôs mission to catalyse, inspire and guide the best in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) education and public engagement. The ultimate aim of this effort is that Ireland will have the most engaged and scientifically informed public by 2020 as outlined in Science Foundation Ireland‚Äôs strategy Agenda 2020. This also aligns to the national science innovation strategy, Innovation 2020. History Over the years, Science Week Ireland has grown from a small pilot initiative to a large promotional and event engine to its current identity as a recognised vehicle for regional activity supported by a national promotional campaign. In 1995, a National Science week was organised by the Royal Dublin Society and a number of other organisations to inform the general public about science. The first Science Week organised by Forf√°s was held in 1996. If was run by Forf√°s on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation under the name 'Information Technology and Science Week'. The week aimed to raise general awareness of the benefits of science and information technology to people, young and old throughout society. In 1997 it was renamed Science Week. Professional bodies, voluntary groups, colleges, businesses and the public sector combined to organise 50 events countrywide. Events included conferences, lectures, interactive exhibitions, debates, and competitions for primary school students. SFI took over Science Week from the Forf√°s Discover Science and Engineering programme in 2012. Science Week continued to grow and develop over the following years into what it represents today, a week-long celebration of STEM public engagement, enhancing the public‚Äôs interest in STEM and enabling them to see the relevance of STEM to their daily lives.  1996  In 1996, Forf√°s organised the first Information Technology and Science Week beginning on November 25.  1997  Science week ran between November 10-16 and was again organised by Forf√°s. It was launched by minister Noel Treacy in Galway. Events included answering scientific questions for school children and a Speakathon organised by the Irish Research Scientists' Association.  1998  Science Week 1998 ran from November 1st to 8th. Events included talks in public libraries and another Speakathon. Forf√°s sought feedback on the running of Science Week and it was also externally evaluated.  2007  Science Week 2007 took place between 11‚Äì18 November and the theme was \\"Surrounded by Science\\".

He was a leading figure in the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century, and was created Earl of Ulster in 1205 by King John of England. De Lacy was the younger son of Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath, a descendant of Walter de Lacy, who went to England after the Norman conquest. Around 1189, he was appointed Viceroy of Ireland, a position previously held by his father. He was replaced in 1190 by Guillaume le Petil. He was later reappointed to serve as viceroy from 1205 to 1210. Carlow motte and bailey He erected a motte in the 1180s in Carlow, on the site of which Carlow Castle was built in the 13th century. Excavations at Carlow Castle in 1996, found the remains of a series of post-holes inside a curving ditch, running under the walls of the towered keep and therefore pre-dating it. The remains of a corn-drying kiln were found to the north of this. These features were interpreted as representing the remains of the first castle here, whose defences and buildings seem to have been constructed of earth and timber. A reinterpretation of the historical sources suggests that this primary timber castle was built in the early 1180s by Hugh de Lacy for John de Clahull. Capture of John de Courcy and Earldom of Ulster De Lacy was for a time a coadjutor with John de Courcy in Leinster and Munster. But in 1199, King John of England authorised de Lacy to wage war on de Courcy, who had conquered much of Ulster without help or permission from the King. Hugh captured de Courcy in 1204. An account of the capture appears in the Book of Howth. In 1205, King John created him Earl of Ulster and made what was de Courcy's territory in Ulster the Earldom of Ulster. He granted Drogheda its charter. He continued the conquest of the north-eastern over-kingdom of Ulaid, building on de Courcy's success, with the earldom spanning across the modern counties of Antrim and Down and parts of Londonderry. He tried, without much success, to reduce the O'Neill of Tyrone to submission. In 1207 war broke out between the earl of Ulster and Meiler Fitzhenry, the chief justice. This brought King John in person to Ireland, where he expelled the earl's brother, Walter de Lacy, from Meath, and compelled the earl himself to flee to Scotland. Exiled in 1210 by King John, Hugh took part in the Albigensian Crusade for 13 years. On his return he allied himself with O'Neill against the English. In 1226 his lands in Ulster were handed over to his brother Walter, but were restored to him in the following year, after which date he appears to have loyally served the king, being more than once summoned to England to give advice about Irish affairs. He died at Carrickfergus in 1242 or 1243. Family He purportedly separated from his first wife and was living adulterously. He had legitimate and natural children, and historic sources give contradictory accounts. In 1226, his daughter by his first wife married Alan, Lord of Galloway. He secondly married Emmeline de Riddlesford, the daughter of Walter de Riddlesford about 1242. With Emmeline he had a daughter, Lady Maud de Lacy, who married Walter Bourke, Lord of Connaught in 1264. He became Earl of Ulster in her right. Emmeline's second marriage was with Stephen de Longespee, grandson of Henry II of England,Charles Cawley, Medieval Lands, Earls of Salisbury 1196-1310 by whom she had two daughters: Ela Longespee, Lady of Ashby (1244c. 19 July 1276) and Emmeline Longespee, Lady of Offaly.

History As early as 1923 the Chief Rabbis of Israel, Abraham Kook and Jacob Meir, mooted plans for a large central synagogue in Jerusalem. It was over 30 years later in 1958 when Heichal Shlomo, seat of the Israeli Rabbinate, was founded, that a small synagogue was established within the building. As time passed and the need for more space grew, services were moved and held in the foyer of Heichal Shlomo. Soon afterwards, when the premises could not hold the number of worshippers attending, it was decided that a new, much larger synagogue be built. The plot of land next to Heichal Shlomo was purchased with the efforts of Dr Moshe Avrohom Yaffe, chairman of the Board of Management of Heichal Shlomo. The main sponsor for construction of the new synagogue was Sir Isaac Wolfson, a Jewish philanthropist from Britain. The Wolfson family consecrated the synagogue in the memory of the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust and to the fallen soldiers of Israel Defense Forces. The style of the building was modeled on the Jewish Temple by German-born architect Dr. Alexander Friedman (see selective list of works: ). The inauguration took place on Tu B'Av 1982. Naftali Hershtik was appointed the chief cantor of the synagogue, a position he held until succeeded by chief Chazan Chaim Adler on 31 December 2008. In addition, Chazanim Avraham Kirshenbaum and Tzvi Weiss often lead the prayers, either alone or together with Chief Chazan Adler. The sanctuary seats 850 men and 550 women.

He first served as Iraq's ambassador to Japan in 2004. He has four children, Anas, Youssra, Mariam and Omar. Al-Jumaily holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of New Mexico, an M.S. in Optics from the University of Arizona, and a B.S. in Physics from the University of Baghdad. During the course of his career he came to hold two patents in the field of optics. Prior to his appointment as ambassador, he served as the CEO of Life for Relief and Development, a Michigan-based charity credited with helping Iraqi families during the Post-Gulf War I period. Before that, he worked for various private firms, including Minnesota-based Seagate. He also worked for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California where he worked specifically on the Mars Pathfinder rover. In 1999, Aljumaily co edited a book by the name of Optical Metrology. He began work as the Iraqi Ambassador to Japan in October 2004 where he served as the first Iraqi Ambassador to Japan since the early 1990s. He was appointed by the Council of Representatives of Iraq from amongst a list of the first 40 Ambassadors of Iraq after Saddam Hussein's regime. Al-Jumaily is currently an engineering professor at the College of Engineering, Technology, and Aeronautics at Southern New Hampshire University.  Iraq‚ÄìJapan strategic partnership  As Iraqi Ambassador to Japan, Aljumaily, backed by his government, worked on and succeeded in developing a strategic partnership between Iraq and Japan. The strategic partnership, signed by former Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe and by Deputy Iraqi Prime Minister in January 2009 Barham Salih covers the following points: * The country's most important priority, the education sector, is to be rehabilitated under the framework of the strategic partnership agreement. This includes rehabilitating and building new education infrastructure, developing and improving educational systems, and developing and improving teaching methods. * The creation of a partnership between Iraq and Japan in the energy sector by which Japanese companies play a key role in infusing needed technology and investment in the rebuilding of infrastructure in upstream as well down stream while Iraq provides Japan with a stable source of its need of petroleum and natural gas. * The creation of a partnership in the electricity sector to rebuild existing power stations and build new ones to meet the growing demand of the Iraqi market. The priority in this field will be to convert the associated natural gas that is being wasted into valuable energy. * The creation of a partnership by which the Japanese private sector, backed by the Japanese government, plays a key role in the privatization of public sector companies in Iraq. * The creation of a partnership in the health sector by which Japanese companies, backed by the Japanese government, play a role in rehabilitating existing hospitals and medical systems in Iraq and building new hospitals and medical systems in Iraq. This partnership also covers educating Iraqi medical workers to use modern medical equipment.  Ambassador to Saudi Arabia  In September 2008, Arabic news agencies reported that Al-Jumaily had been nominated to be Iraq's first Ambassador to Saudi Arabia since the Gulf War. In March 2009, his appointment was confirmed. In April 2009, during a discussion between Al-Jumaily and Iraq's President Jalal Talabani, the President credited Al-Jumaily for building robust ties with Japan during his term as Ambassador there. The Ambassador replied that he understands the weight of his new mission and will work to build ties with what he called a country with ancestral and brotherly ties with Iraq. He also promised to create an embassy in Iraq that would serve as a representative of all Iraqi people.

Tendons and bone tissue require considerably longer to adapt than muscle tissue. In sports science theory, supercompensation is the post training period during which the trained function/parameter has a higher performance capacity than it did prior to the training period.  Description  Initial fitness, training, recovery, and supercompensation The fitness level of a human body in training can be broken down into four periods: initial fitness, training, recovery, and supercompensation. During the initial fitness period, the target of the training has a base level of fitness (shown by the first time sector in the graph). Upon entering the training period, the target's level of fitness decreases (shown by the second time sector in the graph). After training, the body enters the recovery period during which level of fitness increases up to the initial fitness level (shown by the third time sector in the graph). Because the human body is an adjustable organism, it will feel the need to adjust itself to a higher level of fitness in anticipation of the next training session. Accordingly, the increase in fitness following a training session does not stop at the initial fitness level. Instead the body enters a period of supercompensation during which fitness surpasses the initial fitness level (shown by the fourth time sector in the graph). If there are no further workouts, this fitness level will slowly decline back towards the initial fitness level (shown by the last time sector in the graph). First put forth by Russian scientist Nikolai N. Yakovlev (1911‚Äì1992) in 1949-1959, this theory is a basic principle of athletic training. If the next workout takes place during the recovery period, overtraining may occur. If the next workout takes place during the supercompensation period, the body will advance to a higher level of fitness. If the next workout takes place after the supercompensation period, the body will remain at the base level. More complex variations are possible; for instance, sometimes a few workouts are intentionally made in the recovery period to achieve greater supercompensation effects.  The relation between supercompensation and training programs  At a first glance, creating effective training programs might look simple. All you need is to determine the intensity level and how long it takes you to get to the supercompensation period. Afterwards, continue training with the intensity level that was determined previously and keep the necessary intervals between workouts required for supercompensation. However, things become more complex because training affects many different bodily functions and parameters. Each bodily function or parameter has a different recovery time, a different amount of time needed to reach peak supercompensation, a different amount of time between supercompensation peak and return to base fitness. The aforementioned functions and parameters are basic ones. Muscle strength and mass are complex parameters. For instance, muscle mass is a function of many different simple parameters. For example, amount of glycogen in muscles is a basic parameter that influences muscle mass.  Use of supercompensation in practice  In classical sport science, the yearly (sometimes multi-yearly) period is divided to micro and macro cycles, where each microcycle is responsible for the development of a specific (sometimes several) basic training function and parameter, whereas macrocycles are responsible for the development of complex parameters/functions (such as muscle strength). During each microcycle, the resting period is the same as the amount of time needed for reaching the supercompensation stage of the current training parameter/function (also during such a micro cycle there shouldn't be any negative influence on the recovery of the main function). Such a training method will work only when the developed functions/parameters are non-related. Unfortunately, for muscle strength and mass this is not the case (functions/parameters are related). Therefore, for muscle strength and mass different approaches are needed. During a training cycle the intensity and volume of training varies, waves of different functions are overlaid so that until the end of the microcycle supercompensation of the main required functions is achieved.

The name derives from Old English, and translates as Clean-stream (the Welsh name of Clydach, has similar origins). The river lends its name to several settlements on its route, Clyst Honiton, Clyst St Lawrence, Clyst St George, and Broadclyst. The William part of Clyst William derives from the Old English of aewelm, which means river source. Rising near the village of Clyst William near Cullompton, the river runs for , west and southwest, flowing through the settlements of Norman's Green, Plymtree, Clyst Hydon, Clyst St. Lawrence, Westwood, emerging in the Clyst Valley. From there, the river goes southward through Broadclyst, West Clyst, Clyst Honiton, Clyst St. Mary and Clyst St. George, eventually flowing into the Exe estuary at Bowling Green Marsh, immediately south of the port of Topsham near Exeter. The river discharges per second on average, and is tidal from the Exe estuary as far as Newcourt Barton. In 2011 work started on a new cycle and pedestrian bridge crossing the River Clyst at Fishers Mill, Topsham, forming part of the Sustrans‚Äô National Cycle Network [NCN]. The bridge feeds into the Exe Estuary Trail, part of NCN2, and was opened in November 2013. A elevated timber boardwalk was planned across the salt marshes and flood plain with a main bridge spanning across the river. The new bridge is downstream from an existing narrow grade II listed masonry highway bridge. In winter, the flood plain attracts large flocks of Brant geese and Canada geese. On the north side of the Clyst, just west of the Exmouth railway line, is Bowling Green Marsh, a small RSPB reserve with a hide (SX971877). In 1988, a spill of diesel oil into the estuary threatened the habitat and the birds in the area around the river mouth. Special booms and pumps were brought in to remove the spill. A 1994 survey of fish species in the river determined that it contained bullhead, dace, eel, minnow, stone loach, stickleback, mullet and flounder. The only salmonids were some trout in one of the tributaries. By 2008, concerns were being raised about the quality of the water citing a high level of pollution.

Today it is located at 15 Plugat ha-Kotel Street. It is named after Rabbi David ben Shimon, (acronym D-b-Sh, ), who arrived in the Land of Israel from Morocco in 1854 and founded Machane Yisrael, one of the first neighborhoods outside of the Old City walls. During the 19th century, a greater number of Jews arrived in Jerusalem from the North African countries. Through Ben Shimon's influence, the group broke off from the greater Sephardic community of Jerusalem and established the Westerners' Synagogue (as opposed to the Eastern Mizrahi Jews) in 1860. The building also contained the community's Talmud Torah and an old age home. The community's property register, which was written after Ben Shimon's death in 1879, listed a yard with two synagogues, with the Ben Tzuf synagogue described as the \\"large and special one.\\" The register adds that people would rise each midnight to study at the synagogue. The upper floor contained the Talmud Torah, which consisted of three rooms. The lower floor housed the meeting room of the community council, as well as two small rooms in which lived the widows who cleaned the yard. After the 1948 war, the building was under Jordanian rule, along with the entire Old City of Jerusalem. Though the building was looted, it remained standing. After the Six-Day War, the building was refurbished and in 1980 it was restored as a house of prayer. The domed rooms were rededicated in 1988 by the French community. The building also serves as a yeshiva. See also *Yosef Yitzchak Shloush References *Shalev, Nirit. MiSfarad LeYerushalayim: HaKehila HaSefaradit BaRova HaYehudi.

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1973 VFL Premiership team was Richmond. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Peter McKenna of Collingwood who kicked 84 goals (including 2 goals in the finals). * The winner of the 1973 Brownlow Medal was Keith Greig of North Melbourne with 27 votes. * South Melbourne took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1973. * The reserves premiership was won by . Richmond 17.18 (120) defeated 8.12 (60) in the Grand Final, held as a curtain-raiser to the seniors Grand Final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 29 September. Notable events * The centre diamond was used on all VFL grounds throughout 1973 and 1974. It was replaced by the centre square at the beginning of the 1975 VFL season. * The VFL introduced a new clearance system, \\"10-year rule\\", in order to render the VFL immune from the sorts of \\"restraint of trade\\" difficulties that were being experienced, at the time, in New South Wales in relation to Rugby League footballers, whereby any VFL player who had played ten years with a single club was eligible for a free transfer to the club of his choice. **Although twenty-two VFL players were eligible to do so, only six players, George Bisset (Footscray to Collingwood), Barry Davis (Essendon to North Melbourne), Carl Ditterich (St Kilda to Melbourne), Adrian Gallagher (Carlton to Footscray), John Rantall (South Melbourne to North Melbourne), and Doug Wade (Geelong to North Melbourne) took advantage of the new rule. The rule was rescinded in May 1973. **The new North Melbourne coach Ron Barassi recruited champion half- backs Barry Davis (who had already played 218 games for Essendon), John Rantall (who had already played 174 games for South Melbourne), and champion full-forward Doug Wade (who had already played 208 games for Geelong). North Melbourne improved from last place in 1972 to sixth in 1973. * In Round 11 Kevin Murray played his 300th game for Fitzroy. * In Round 21, Hawthorn full- forward Peter Hudson, who had been injured in Round 1 of 1972, returned to the VFL. He beat four opponents and kicked 8 goals. * In Round 22, Hawthorn hosted its last senior VFL football match at Glenferrie Oval. The ground was notable for its temperamental playing surface and narrow flanks (wedged between the railway line on the one side and houses on the other). The venue had long been described by football fans as \\"the sardine can.\\" Hawthorn subsequently played its home games at Princes Park for the next eighteen seasons. * The Richmond Football Club won the premiership in all grades in 1973: its Senior Team, Reserves Team and Under-19 team all won their Grand Finals at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Grand Final Day; and the Essex Heights Football Club, which served as Richmond's Under-17 team, won the South-East Suburban League premiership.

It is located along PA Route 982 in a heavily wooded area about 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh at an elevation of 1,209 feet. History=UFO incident A model depicting the supposedly crashed object, called the \\"space acorn\\", originally created for the show Unsolved Mysteries, and put on display near the Kecksburg fire station. On December 9, 1965 a large, brilliant fireball was seen by thousands in at least six states and Ontario, Canada. It streaked over the Detroit, Michigan/Windsor, Ontario area, dropped metal debris over Michigan and northern Ohio, and caused sonic booms in Western Pennsylvania. The fireball landed in the woods just outside Kecksburg and was reportedly acorn-shaped. Some speculated that it was a UFO, however the United States government officially stated that it was just a meteor. A large bell-shaped metallic object was made by Unsolved Mysteries for their story on the incident. After the story aired, the show donated the model to the town, and it was placed upon a three-legged wooden pedestal behind the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Department. The model was taken indoors for a time, however it is now back outside on a new metal pedestal lit with spotlights. To celebrate this local event, the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Department holds an annual festival featuring presentations by UFO enthusiasts, vendor booths, and a community parade.

The character and the plot is inspired from The Crow created by James O'Barr. Origin Anthony was a great singer and his album \\"Crow Sangeet\\" (Crow Music) became very popular all over the world. He was murdered by jealousy and later resurrected by nature itself. Now he is undead and as long as his soul is out of his body, his corpse lies motionless. Though several times his corpse was possessed by numerous enemies including Count Dracula. Plot summary The late Anthony Gonsalvez, a young music enthusiast, composed an original album entitled \\"Crow Music.\\" This album became very popular, much to the dismay of his competitors. He was tortured to death by his rivals. He is fondly remembered by his wife Julia and daughter Maria and his pet crow Prince still sits on his tombstone to mourn his death. Whenever innocent people are subjected to injustice, Prince cries out, loud and shrill, in the graveyard. The air trembles, the clouds thunder, lightning flashes, and the dead man Anthony rises out of his grave to render the justice.

The museum is located on the University's Downing Site, on the corner of Downing Street and Tennis Court Road. In 2013 it reopened following a major refurbishment of the exhibition galleries, with a new public entrance directly on to Downing Street. The museum is part of the University of Cambridge Museums consortium. History Founded in 1884 as the University's Museum of General and Local Archaeology, the museum initial collections included local antiquities collected by the Cambridge Antiquarian Society and artefacts from Polynesia donated by Alfred Maudslay and Sir Arthur Gordon. Anatole von H√ºgel, the museum's first curator donated his own collection of artefacts from the South Pacific. More material was collected by the 1898 Cambridge anthropological expedition to the Torres Strait under Alfred Haddon and W. H. R. Rivers. Haddon and Rivers would encourage their Cambridge students ‚Äî including Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, John Layard and Gregory Bateson ‚Äî to continue to collect for the museum in their ethnographic fieldwork. Von H√ºgel set in motion a move to larger, specially built, premises: in 1913 the museum moved to its present location in Downing Street, although the new galleries were not fully installed until after World War I. Various depositions and donations of eighteenth-century collections ‚Äî including material collected on James Cook's three expeditions ‚Äî were made to the museum in the 1910s and 1920s. Von H√ºgel's successors as curator have been Louis Colville Gray Clarke (from 1922 to 1937), Thomas Paterson (from 1937 to 1948), Geoffrey Bushnell (from 1948 to 1970), Peter Gathercole (from 1970 to 1981), Prof. David Phillipson (1981 to 2006), and the 2006-present Director, Prof. Nicholas Thomas. The museum's current displays are arranged on three floors: * Ground floor: The Clarke Hall: Archaeology of Cambridge and the Li Ka Shing Gallery (Temporary Exhibitions) * First floor: The Maudslay Hall: Anthropology * Second floor: Andrews Gallery: World Archaeology The museum building, which is Grade II listed, incorporates the central section of Inigo Jones's choir screen from Winchester Cathedral. Gweagal Spears In 1770, after returning to England from their voyage in the South Pacific Ocean, Captain James Cook and botanist Joseph Banks brought with them, along with a large collection of flora and fauna, many cultural artefacts. These included a collection of roughly fifty Australian Aboriginal spears that belonged to the Gweagal people. The spears were given to Cook's patron John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, who then gave them, to his alma mater Trinity College, and four are still in existence. The spears are among the few remaining artefacts that can be traced back to Cook's first voyage. Although the Gweagal Spears remain in the ownership of Trinity College, they are on display at the Museum.

W. Bush or George W. Bush. More specifically, it is used to denote the inner circle of Bush advisors, appointees, and acolytes. The label carries much the same meaning as the terms \\"Reaganite\\", \\"Clintonista\\", ‚ÄúObamabot‚Äù, and ‚ÄúTrumpeteer‚Äù, which are used to denote aides and followers of Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump respectively.  History  Although the term has a longer recorded usage, it first came to prominence with the 1993 John Podhoretz book about his experiences working for the George H. W. Bush White House, Hell of a Ride. According to reviewer Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post, :A Bushie is defined by Podhoretz as \\"someone either directly beholden to [George Herbert Walker Bush] or someone to whom Bush was directly beholden,\\" someone who could prove himself to interviewers in the Bush job- appointments team as having \\"Bush experience,\\" meaning not \\"general Republican experience, perhaps working on a Senate race in Idaho or something, but ... Bush experience solely.\\" The term was also defined by David Brooks in a review of the 2001 book Reagan In His Own Hand: The Writings of Ronald Reagan That Reveal His Revolutionary Vision for America. Brooks differentiated Reaganites and Bushies as types of Republicans. While Reaganites were often Hayekian academics connected to think tanks, Bushies tended to be \\"boring\\" corporate careerists with \\"neat desks and thin briefcases because their reading comes in the form of memos\\", who saw themselves as \\"master managers\\" and politics as a \\"competition of interests\\" rather than ideas. Although Brooks acknowledged that both groups were skeptical of government, their skepticism took different forms, with the Reaganites viewing the Bushies as skilled at political or bureaucratic wrangling, but lacking principles. According to Brooks, the failure of the Bushies in the first two years of the elder Bush administration, which led to major losses in the 1992 Congressional elections, brought about the ascendancy of \\"ideologues\\" such as Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey, but their \\"uncompromising\\" approach once again returned the reins of the party to the Bushies by the 2000 election, in which George W. Bush was elected. The term became prominent during the investigation of the controversial replacement of several U.S. Attorneys when it was revealed that Justice Department official Kyle Sampson suggested in an e-mail to then- Attorney General John Ashcroft that :we would like to replace 15-20 percent of the current U.S. Attorneys -- the underperforming ones . . . The vast majority of U.S. Attorneys, 80-85 percent, I would guess, are doing a great job, are loyal Bushies, etc., etc.\\" According to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, :The real question is whether being a \\"loyal Bushie\\" meant letting partisan considerations poison law enforcement decisions.... The actions of the Bush Administration call into question every decision by federal prosecutors in corruption cases across the country.

It is one of two compounds of aluminium and boron, the other being AlB12, which are both commonly referred to as aluminium boride. Structurally the B atoms form graphite-like sheets with Al atoms between them, and this is very similar to the structure of magnesium diboride. Single crystals of AlB2 exhibit metallic conductivity along the axis parallel to the basal hexagonal plane. Aluminium boride is considered a hazardous substance as it reacts with acids and hydrogen gas to produce toxic gases. For example, it reacts with hydrochloric acid to release borane and aluminium chloride. The crystal structure of AlB2 is often used as a prototype structure to describe intermetallic compounds.

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1974 VFL Premiership team was Richmond. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Doug Wade of North Melbourne who kicked 103 goals (including 12 goals in the finals). * The winner of the 1974 Brownlow Medal was Keith Greig of North Melbourne with 27 votes. **Many were even more surprised at Greig winning his second Brownlow than they had been at him winning his first (in 1973). In 1973 Barry Davis had won North Melbourne's best and fairest award, and in 1974 John Rantall won North Melbourne's best and fairest award. Greig had not even been the \\"runner-up\\" in North Melbourne's best and fairest in either 1973 or 1974. * Melbourne took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1974. * The reserves premiership was won by . Fitzroy 26.13 (169) defeated 16.12 (108) in the Grand Final, held as a curtain-raiser to the seniors Grand Final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 28 September. Notable events * In the Round 7 match between Essendon and Richmond at Windy Hill, Richmond's Mal Brown clashed with Essendon's Graeme Jenkin as the teams moved towards the locker rooms at the half-time siren; after Essendon runner Laurie Ashley went out of his way to confront and abuse Brown, Brown struck Ashley, starting a 15-minute brawl that involved players, team officials, trainers, fans, and police. Richmond's Brian Roberts was left with a broken nose, while Essendon trainer Jim Bradley and a fan were both knocked unconscious and had to be carried from the arena on stretchers. Four players and three officials were charged as a result of the investigation: ** Laurie Ashley (Essendon runner): suspended for 6 matches after being held to be responsible for starting the brawl. ** Mal Brown (Richmond player): suspended for one match for striking Laurie Ashley. ** Jim Bradley (Essendon fitness adviser): suspended for 6 matches for charging and striking Mal Brown. ** Steve Parsons (Richmond player): suspended for 4 matches for striking Jim Bradley. ** Ron Andrews (Essendon player): suspended for 6 matches for striking Brian Roberts. ** Graeme Richmond (Richmond team manager): suspended until 31 December 1974 (17 matches) and fined $2,000 by the VFL Board of Directors for conduct unbecoming or prejudicial to the interests of the League.

Chanda killed her husband in the form of Shakti. Chanda keeps herself busy in hospital and social works. She has a third eye which is the sign of the Goddess Kali, but keepsit covered with a headband which she pretends to use to cure her permanent migraine.

Kali is the destroyer of demons and the last word in woman-power. She has a raging desire to get justice for women in this man's world. The distress cries from any woman, anywhere in the world, turn her ordinary self of Chanda into a ferocious killer known as Shakti. Shakti is Maha Kali - Great Kali. Attributes Chanda, the housewife, is extremely simple and not very much educated. She lacks sex appeal, due to which she was disliked by her former husband. Her alter ego, Shakti, on the other hand, does not tolerate injustice and crime at all and is also strikingly beautiful. Although considered hotheaded and arrogant, she is gracious enough to generate love in people's hearts for one another. Physically, she is blue in colour, stands 5 feet and 7 inches in height and weighs about 50 kg. Powers & Abilities She has power of anger of women of the world. She can sense any woman's cry and pain in the world and can turn into light and travel at the speed of light. The incredible amount of energy in her, when released, melts all metals and instantly molds it into shapes and designs as projected by Shakti's mind . When she opens her third eye, situated on her forehead, in anger it beams infernos to burn down the cause of her rage. She is physically the strongest character in the Raj comics universe. She could even carry an airplane with ease and can travel with it at the speed of light. In TRIKALI comic she did time travel to go to the past with her super speed. She also has superhuman strength and endurance. Enemies All the other raj comics superheroes.

The pursuing English fleet, under the command of Admiral of the Fleet Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford, destroyed a number of French ships that had been beached near the port of Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. Background During the Nine Years War, the English and French fleets had engaged off the coast of Normandy. Tourville‚Äôs fleet of badly damaged ships was swept by wind and tide down the coast of the Cotentin peninsula, pursued by an English fleet under Admiral of the Fleet Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford. The French beached three of their most badly damaged ships at Cherbourg, where they were attacked and destroyed by an English squadron under Vice Admiral of the Red Sir Ralph Delaval. The remaining ten French ships, commanded by Tourville and four of his flag officers, were swept down the coast, to be beached on the evening of 21 May (OS) outside the small port of Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. Action=Situation 21 May 1692 This was the place where the French had assembled an army, under the command of James II, and fleet of transports, for the invasion of England. Tourville‚Äôs force joined two of the ships that had retired from the battle with Nesmond ( Bourbon 68 and Saint-Louis 64), which had been beached at la Hougue the day before. The ships were put ashore in two groups on the wide beaches on either side of the town. On the north beach, between the town and the small tidal island of Tatihou, lay Ambitieux 96 guns, (flagship of Villette Mursay and Tourville), Merveillieux 90 (d‚ÄôAmfreville), Foudroyant 84 (Relingue), and Magnifique 86 (Coetlogon). With them was the smaller St Philippe 84, and, further out on the shore of Tatihou, the Terrible 80. These ships were covered by shore batteries at the Fort d‚ÄôIslet, on Tatihou (44 guns in total), and on platforms set up by the army on the north shore. On the south beach, under the eyes of James and his army at Morsalines, were the Bourbon 68, and St Louis 64, from Nesmond‚Äôs division, and Fier 80, Tonnant 80, Gaillard 68, and Fort 60, which came in with Tourville. These were covered by the 68 guns of Fort St Vaast, and artillery on gun platforms along the shore. Also, in a small harbour known as the port of La Hougue, which was behind the town of St Vaast and under the guns of the fort, was the fleet of transports prepared for the invasion. The fleet was also protected by a fleet of 200 boats, and 3 oared galleys mounting 12 guns each. James' offer to station troops on the ships to guard against boarding was not taken up. Preparations 22 May The English fleet, under Russell, started to arrive on the evening of 21 May; the rest of the fleet joined during the night and over the next two days. Russell immediately organised an inshore squadron under the Rear-admiral of the red, Sir Cloudesley Shovell, to attack the French positions, but Shovell later collapsed from wounds received at Barfleur. He had to be replaced by Rear Admiral George Rooke, while the waters around St Vaast and La Hougue had to be sounded, which took up most of the 22nd. The assault did not start until the following day. Russell also used the 22nd to organise the 3rd and 4th rates of his command to form a blockade line close inshore, while the bigger 1st and 2nd rates were set to organise boats and boarding crews. The Earl of Danby was keen to take part in the action, and appealed first to Shovell, and later to Rooke, to do so. In the assault he was given command of the boat parties that went close inshore. The Battle at La Hogue: engraving by William Woollett (1781) after a painting by Benjamin West First Action 23 May At 6am on the 23, the ships of the inshore squadron were ordered to attack the ships on the north beach. After a preliminary bombardment the boats were despatched, and about 8.30 am one of the fireships grappled the Terrible, which was in a more exposed position. Finding her deserted, the fireship captain refrained from igniting his ship, but boarded Terrible and started fires with what material was to hand; for this he was much commended in saving his charge for a better occasion. Meanwhile, the boats closed with the other ships. They were accompanied by another fireship, which drew the fire from the French batteries; the supporting ships countered, sweeping the French gun platforms, which were too exposed to continue. One boat, from the Eagle, grounded on the shore, and was attacked by French cavalry. In a highly unusual encounter, one of the troopers was pulled down by a sailor using a boathook, before the boat was re-floated. Resistance melted away as the attack was pressed, and the English sailors were able to board and fire the five remaining great ships along the north beach. Second Action 24 May The second action opened at 5am on the 24 when Rooke again sent in his boats, to attack the six great ships on the south beach. Supported by gunfire from Deptford and Crown, and with close support from Charles and Greyhound, both under oars, the English sailors were able to board and fire all six ships. The French seamen, and the troops ashore, were demoralised by this point, and had abandoned the ships with little resistance in the face of the determined English assault. This episode was seen by James II, who had been watching from his camp at Marsaline; he was moved to remark, with the lack of tact for which he was notorious, ‚ÄúOnly my English tars could have done such a deed‚Äù. Third Action 24 May Rooke now saw an opportunity to follow up the success with an attack, at high water, on the transports in La Hougue harbour. The boats, led by Rooke, and with two fireships in tow, entered the harbour on the flooding tide, despite gunfire from both the fort and the ships. Both fireships grounded in the shallows below the fort, and had to be burned without result, but a number of ships in the harbour were boarded and set alight, mostly transports, but also a 4th or 5th rate warship and a hulk. Several other of the transports were captured, and carried away when the boats retreated on the ebb, but most of the transports were too far up the harbour to be boarded, and escaped serious damage. Conclusion This marked the end of the action, which had been a complete success for the allied fleet; 12 French ships of the line and a number of smaller ships had been destroyed, with minimal English casualties. The action also dashed any hope that James or Louis might have had to mount an invasion that year.

Plot An elderly woman and her six- year-old granddaughter Sophia spend a summer together on a tiny island in the Gulf of Finland exploring, talking about life, nature, everything but their feelings about Sophia's mother's death and their love for one another. Reception The novelist Ali Smith, reviewing the book in The Guardian, wrote that Jansson was better known for her Moomin books than for her novels, and that with her worldwide fame, she knew the virtues of withdrawal. In Smith's view, The Summer Book is an astonishing achievement of artistry, \\"the writing so lightly kept, so simple-seeming, so closely concerned with the weighing of moments that any extra weight of exegesis is too much.\\" Telling the tale of the child and her grandmother in the simplest language, Smith writes, \\"The threat of brevity, even on this timeless island in this timeless, gorgeous summer, is very marked. But Jansson's brilliance is to create a narrative that seems, at least, to have no forward motion, to exist in lit moments, gleaming dark moments, like lights on a string, each chapter its own beautifully constructed, random-seeming, complete story. Her writing is all magical deception, her sentences simple and loaded; the novel reads like looking through clear water and seeing, suddenly, the depth.\\" Smith praises Thomas Teal's English translation as \\"original and stunning\\". The journalist Antonia Windsor described it as \\"like a meditation on life and love and surviving in the natural world. It is a wonderfully humane and gentle book.\\" The New York Review of Books writes that Jansson's characters, the girl and her grandmother, \\"discuss things that matter to young and old alike: life, death, the nature of God and of love.\\" The novelist Philip Pullman described the book as \\"a marvelous, beautiful, wise novel, which is also very funny.\\" See also *Tove Jansson *Sophia Jansson ‚Äì Jansson's niece and the real-life model for the character of Sophia. *Signe Hammarsten-Jansson ‚Äì Jansson's mother and the real-life model for the character of Sophia's grandmother.

History G√ºstrow Castle A first short-lived predecessor existed after the death of Henry IV, Duke of Mecklenburg in 1477 and the subsequent partition of his lands among his sons in 1480. Albert VI received the estates of the former Lordship of Werle around G√ºstrow. However, Albert died without issue in 1483 and his lands were inherited by his younger brother Magnus II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. When Magnus died in 1503, his sons Henry V and Albert VII at first ruled jointly over the entire Mecklenburg duchy until its renewed division by the 1520 Neubrandenburg Treaty. Albert, a fierce opponent of the Protestant Reformation, had insisted on the partition and became duke of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow, while his brother Henry retained Mecklenburg-Schwerin. However Mecklenburg de jure remained undivided; both brothers held the title of Duke of Mecklenburg and, as Henry only left one insane son when he died in 1552, the Schwerin lands fell back to Albert's sons Ulrich III and John Albert I. At this time John Albert and Ulrich had ruled jointly over the G√ºstrow lands, but now came into conflict over the inherited Schwerin part. The controversy was finally decided in 1556 by the Ruppin dictum of Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg: John Albert I received Schwerin while Ulrich remained Duke of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. Ulrich died without heirs in 1603 and G√ºstrow fell back to John Albert's grandchildren Adolf Frederick I and John Albert II, joint rulers of Mecklenburg-Schwerin from 1610 onwards. Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow was created for a third and final time with the partition of 1621, when John Albert II received the G√ºstrow part of Mecklenburg. In 1628 he and his brother at Schwerin were stripped of their duchies by order of Emperor Ferdinand II von Habsburg in favour of his Generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein. Officially the dukes were reproached for having secretly sided with Christian IV, King of Denmark, while in fact Mecklenburg was given in compensation of the enormous expenses Wallenstein had paid in building up Imperial troops. He took his residence at G√ºstrow but was dismissed by the Emperor three years later under pressure from the Prince-electors, while the dukes with the support of Swedish troops were restored. The House of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow had assumed the administration of the former Catholic Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg after its conversion to Lutheranism in 1554. By the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, the diocese was finally secularised and adjudicated to the last administrator, Duke Gustav Adolph. Gustav Adolph's death in 1695 led to an inheritance dispute between his son-in-law Adolphus Frederick II, younger son of Adolf Frederick I and his nephew Frederick William, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, which would lead to the creation of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1701.

The stories, some of which had not previously been published in English, were selected by Ali Smith, who also wrote the book's introduction and had previously reviewed The Summer Book for The Guardian. Thirteen of them are from Jansson's first book for adults, Sculptor's Daughter (1968), and the remaining seven are from four of her other works. Five were included in her 1998 Swedish language collection Messages (Meddelande), including the title piece, a partially fictionalised compilation of letters Jansson had received. They were translated into English from the original Swedish by Silvester Mazzarella, David McDuff and Kingsley Hart. In a review for The Guardian, Josh Lacey described it as a \\"short, brittle book\\" and \\"an oddly satisfying jumble\\" featuring several of Jansson's recurring tropes: \\"strange creatures with surprising powers, islands and small boats and the sea, loneliness and introspection, the vital influence of art and the imagination\\". Sean Michaels for The Skinny said it was \\"in large part exceptional\\". Philip Pullman described the stories as \\"tough as old rope\\" in the afterword he wrote for the book. Stories in A Winter Book include \\"Squirrel\\", in which a woman's isolated life on an island is shared for a time with a squirrel, and the last story, \\"Taking Leave\\", in which two women realise that they have become too frail to spend their summers on the island they love.

Biography  Educated at Lausanne and Paris, he trained as a mining engineer and became a director of several South Wales collieries. He was High Sheriff of Monmouthshire for 1921 and a JP in three counties. During World War I, he raised and commanded the 13th Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment and the 13th Battalion Worcestershire Regiment. He also commanded the 23rd (Works) Battalion, the King's Regiment (Liverpool) and the Western Command Labour Centre. On 28 January 1916 he was made a baronet, of Llwynarthen, Monmouth. On his death the baronetcy became extinct. He was married twice: in 1894 to Ellen Williams, who died in 1919; and then to Helena Kate de Paula. His only son, Second Lieutenant Thomas Harry Basil Webb (1898‚Äì1917), Welsh Guards, was killed in action in World War I, on 1 December 1917, at the age of 19. Basil Webb had been the model for the famous Welsh sculptor Sir William Goscombe John RA when he produced the bronze sculpture, \\"The Boy Scout\\" in 1910. At the age of 12, Basil also composed the Refectory Prayer for Chester Cathedral, which remains in use today. In 1919 Sir Henry Webb bore the costs of renovating the crypt and altar of Chester Cathedral, where an inscription may still be found identifying the restoration work ‚Äòin memory of his gallant son and his companions‚Äô.

Life and crimes At age six, his father walked out on him and Dillbeck's alcoholic mother and he was placed in several foster homes until age 15. On April 11, 1979, Dillbeck, a 15-year-old high school dropout and runaway, was sitting inside a stolen car at a closed park at the beach in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. Someone made a suspicious person complaint about this and Lee County deputy Lynn Hall arrived and questioned Dillbeck. While being questioned by Deputy Lynn Hall, Dillbeck ran from the car. The deputy chased Dillbeck on foot and caught him. During the struggle that followed, Dillbeck, only 15 years old at the time, managed to get the deputy's gun and shot and fatally wounded him. Dillbeck was arrested and, on June 6, 1979, sentenced to life imprisonment. On February 7, 1983, Dillbeck attempted to escape from prison, but was re-captured the same day. For this, he was sentenced to one year and one day in prison. He was later given a 25-year mandatory minimum sentence and taken to a lower-security facility despite being disciplined multiple times including attempted assault in 1984 and drinking intoxicants the following year. On June 22, 1990, Dillbeck was working with other prison inmates at a catering function at Quincy Vocational Center in Quincy, Florida. During the event, Dillbeck walked away from the area and eventually ended up in nearby Tallahassee, Florida. Dillbeck purchased a paring knife and on June 24, 1990, less than 48 hours after his escape, he approached a woman named Faye Vann who was sitting in her vehicle in the parking lot of the Tallahassee Mall. Armed with the knife, Dillbeck attempted to carjack the vehicle entering it, but Vann resisted. He then stabbed Vann repeatedly, causing her death. The vehicle crashed in the Mall lot and Dillbeck fled on foot chased by a Mall Security Officer. First reports to 911 were of a vehicle crash then soon were relayed as a stabbing and a Security Officer in foot pursuit of the suspect. Dillbeck was subsequently arrested by police a short time later still armed with the knife in a back yard of a nearby house. Governor Bob Martinez criticized the incident, ordering tighter custody of inmates and fired the corrections officers involved. According to a 1991 article, the case was \\"reminiscent\\" of Willie Horton being released in 1988 by Michael Dukakis's release programs. According to a 1991 article, Dillbeck's name was the codeword for incompetence between Bob Martinez and Lawton Chiles during their political campaigns. His court- appointed lawyer later admitted to Dillbeck's crimes but tried to save him from the electric chair, but to no avail. Dillbeck was sentenced to the electric chair in 1991. At the sentencing, he told the judge, \\"I'm really sorry for what happened. I wish it didn't, not because I'm standing here, but because it happened. I'm asking for a life sentence, not for my sake, but for my parents' sake,\\" to which his adoptive parents said Dillbeck \\"had been brain damaged and abused\\". In 1993, the state appeals court awarded $150,000 to the Vann's family but later overturned it in 1995, saying \\"the state couldn't be held liable for failing to protect the public from prison escapees\\" and \\"the only duty which existed was a general duty owed to the public not to allow a prisoner escape\\"; the state court did not say, however, if it could be held liable for the acts of prison escapees. Conviction Dillbeck was convicted of first degree murder, armed robbery, and armed burglary and was sentenced to death on March 15, 1991. In addition, he received two consecutive life sentences on top of the one he already had. He was not sentenced for his escape from Quincy Vocational Center. Dillbeck is currently on Death Row at the Union Correctional Institution located in Raiford, Florida. As of December 2016 all of his appeals have run out and he could be given a date for execution at any time.
