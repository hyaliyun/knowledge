MGM made the film in order to capitalize on its winning romantic team of Greta Garbo and John Gilbert who had starred in the 1926 blockbuster Flesh and the Devil. Taking full advantage of the star power, a drama was scripted based on Leo Tolstoy's 1877 novel, Anna Karenina. The result was a failure for the author's purists, but it provided the public with a taste of Gilbert-Garbo eroticism that would never again be matched. The publicity campaign for the film was one of the largest up to that time, and the title was changed from the original, Heat. Director Dimitri Buchowetzki began work on Love with Garbo and Ricardo Cortez. However, producer Irving Thalberg was unhappy with the early filming, and started over by replacing Buchowetzki with Edmund Goulding, cinematographer Merritt B. Gerstad with William H. Daniels, and Cortez with Gilbert.IMDB entry Plot During a blizzard, Russian count Alexis Vronsky, aide-de-camp of the Grand Duke, meets a veiled woman on the way to St. Petersburg, Russia. When they are forced to stop at an inn overnight, Vronsky attempts to seduce her but she rejects him. Later, at a reception for Senator Karenin, Vronsky is presented to the Senator's wife, Anna, who is the woman at the inn, and asks forgiveness for his transgression. This she finally grants. She determines to avoid him and temptation, but boredom with an older husband leads her to see Vronsky again and a relationship develops. Anna has a young son, Sergei, with whom she has an extremely close relationship which thaws as the passion develops between Anna and Vronsky. This passion is noted by the aristocracy, to the displeasure of her husband. After a horse race, in which Anna demonstrates publicly her excessive interest in Vronsky's safety, she visits Vronsky in his rooms to see that he is all right and is cast off by her husband. Anna and Vronsky go off to Italy together. After a while, Anna suffers because she left her son, so Vronsky takes her back to Russia. She visits her son, who had been told she was dead, to bring him presents on his birthday, but is discovered with him by Karenin and barred from the house permanently, He tells her that her son will forget her, as he has done once already, and that her death would be better than the dishonor she will bring on him. He also tells her that the Grand Duke plans to cashier Vronsky from his regiment, ending a long and honourable family tradition of elite army service, because he is cohabitating with Anna. She begs the Grand Duke for mercy and succeeds in persuading him to relent on the condition that she leaves St. Petersberg and never sees Vronsky again. While he is at the dinner to which the Grand Duke has summoned him, she departs. Alternate ending (European version) As a result of being unable to see her son and having to leave Vronsky, she commits suicide by leaping in front of a train. This variant follows the original work of Leo Tolstoy. Alternate ending (American version) For three years, the lovers do not see each other but Vronsky searches frantically for Anna. By chance, he reads in a newspaper that Anna's son is at the Military Academy in St. Petersburg and visits him, learning that Karenin has died and that Anna visits her son daily. They meet and are reunited. (American exhibitors were given the choice of whether or not to use the revised \\"happy\\" ending.

The Pernach is an automatic pistol designed to replace the Stechkin APS in various special OMON units within the Russian police, the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and other paramilitary units. The OTs-33 was developed in 1995 by Igor Stechkin at the TsKIB SOO design bureau, and it went into limited production at the KBP Instrument Design Bureau. It is also known as the SBZ-2 (Russian: –°–ë–ó-2), derived from the names of the KBP team responsible for the pistol, namely Stechkin, Baltser (–ë–∞–ª—å—Ü–µ—Ä) and Zinchenko (–ó–∏–Ω—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ). The designers were tasked with resolving the difficulty of controlling recoil in full-auto mode present in the Stechkin APS pistol and simplifying it for combat deployment. The new pistol has a \\"square\\" shape, which is simpler (and less expensive) to manufacture and has a novel operating principle that increases controllability and reduces recoil. Design details The OTs-33 is a selective fire blowback-operated weapon firing the 9√ó18mm Makarov pistol cartridge; it can use both types of 9x18mm ammunition, the standard 57-N-181S and the more powerful 57-N-181SM round. The blowback operation incorporates a feature that separates the slide and barrel as they move to the rear during recoil; there is no positive lock between the slide and barrel as in other conventional designs. As the slide and barrel separate, the spent case is ejected and the slide is then forced back to the barrel by a spring action, chambering a fresh cartridge in the process. The barrel and slide continue to the rear together in recoil for another before returning to the forward position. This feature improves the automatic fire accuracy, reduces felt recoil, and is responsible for slowing down the cyclic rate of fire, without using a sophisticated rate reducer mechanism such as the one employed in the APS pistol. This method of operation also allows the use of standard and higher power 9x18mm ammunition without using a locked breech action. To further reduce felt recoil and compensate for muzzle rise during firing, some propellant gases are diverted into a ported slide cavity that acts as a muzzle brake and compensator, deflecting the gases upward to stabilize the barrel. The OTs-33 has a double-action trigger mechanism and is hammer fired, with an exposed hammer. The safety/fire selection catch is provided on each side of the pistol at the rear of the slide and has three positions: \\"safe\\" (top setting with a single white dot), semi-automatic fire (intermediate position marked with a single red dot) and fully automatic fire (lower setting with three red dots). When switched to \\"safe\\" mode, the selector mechanism safely depresses the hammer before returning to the safe position. An ambidextrous lever, which also serves in disassembly/stripping of the weapon, is provided inside of the trigger guard and just in front of the trigger. The Pernach also features a loaded chamber indicator. The weapon is aimed using iron sights that consist of an adjustable rear notch and fixed forward blade. The sights have aiming inserts for improved visibility and target acquisition. A folding metal shoulder stock can be screwed onto a point at the base of the grip in order to alleviate problems aiming the weapon while firing in fully automatic mode. The OTs-33 is fed using double-column magazines with a capacity of 18 (standard) or 27 (optional) rounds. The OTs-33 frame has an integral accessory rail under the barrel for tactical lights or laser pointers. The pistol can be equipped with a sound suppressor. The OTs-33 is issued with leather holster that features two separate magazine pouches and a shoulder rig.

The strike occurred over management's demand that the union give up a contract clause which limited management's ability to change the number of workers assigned to a task or to introduce new work rules or machinery which would result in reduced hours or numbers of employees. The strike's effects persuaded President Dwight D. Eisenhower to invoke the back-to-work provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act. The union sued to have the Act declared unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court upheld the law.Shils, \\"Arthur Goldberg: Proof of the American Dream,\\" Monthly Labor Review, January 1997. The union eventually retained the contract clause and won minimal wage increases. On the other hand, the strike led to significant importation of foreign steel for the first time in U.S. history, which replaced the domestic steel industry in the long run.Tiffany, The Decline of American Steel: How Management, Labor, and Government Went Wrong, 1988. The strike remained the longest work stoppage in the American steel industry until the steel strike of 1986. Background USWA founding president Philip Murray died in November 1952, and David J. McDonald was named acting president by the USWA executive board. Although observers felt that Murray had intended to push McDonald out of the union, his sudden death left McDonald in a position to take control. In 1953, the USWA executive board named McDonald president.Daniels, \\"David J. McDonald, Retired Head of Steelworkers Union, Dies at 76,\\" The New York Times, August 9, 1979; Herling, Right to Challenge: People and Power in the Steelworkers Union, 1972.\\"Man of Steel,\\" Time, July 9, 1956; Kelly and Beachler, Man of Steel: The Story of David J. McDonald, 1954. McDonald emphasized enhanced fringe benefits. The election of Dwight Eisenhower as US president and Republican majorities in the United States Congress (at least from 1952 to 1954) made expansion of social programs unlikely, but Eisenhower indeed would extend many of Roosevelt's programs. Subsequently, McDonald focused negotiations on benefits such as unemployment compensation, health insurance, pensions, tuition reimbursement and other items. Throughout the 1950s, however, McDonald felt an intense rivalry with the United Auto Workers (UAW). The UAW often won better wage and benefit packages than the Steelworkers and were able to obtain the closed shop. McDonald's negotiating stands often reflected the interunion jealousy.Fink, Biographical Dictionary of American Labor, 1984. McDonald led the Steelworkers on strike in 1956, winning substantial wage increases, unemployment benefits, layoff rights, and improved pensions. Causes Prior to the 1959 strike, the major American steel companies were reporting high profits which led McDonald and Steelworkers general counsel Arthur J. Goldberg to request a major wage increase. Industry negotiators refused to grant a wage increase unless McDonald agreed to a substantial alteration or an elimination of Section 2(b) of the union's national master contract.\\"Aspirin for Steel,\\" Time, November 16, 1959.Metzgar, Striking Steel: Solidarity Remembered, 2000.Rose, \\"The Struggle over Management Rights at US Steel, 1946‚Äì1960: A Reassessment of Section 2-B of the Collective Bargaining Contract,\\" Business History Review, Autumn 1998. Section 2(b) of the steelworkers' contract limited management's ability to change the number of workers assigned to a task or to introduce new work rules or machinery that would result in reduced hours or fewer employees. Management claimed that it helped featherbedding and reduced the competitiveness of the American steel industry. McDonald characterized management's proposals as an attempt to break the union. Negotiations broke off, and the contract expired on July 1, 1959. Strike President Eisenhower asked both sides to extend the agreement and resume bargaining. McDonald and Goldberg offered to extend the contract by one year. They also proposed creating a joint committee to study changes to Section 2(b) and to the contract's benefit structure. Steelmakers rejected the offer. On July 15, 500,000 steelworkers went on strike. The strike shuttered nearly every steel mill in the country. By the end of August, the Department of Defense voiced concern that there would not be enough steel to meet national defense needs in a crisis. The AFL-CIO quickly began to pressure McDonald to end the strike. Its president, George Meany, was willing to support the strike if it did not affect national security negatively. The strike was also affecting the automaking industry, which was threatening to lay off tens of thousands of Walter Reuther's members from a steel shortage.Stebenne, Arthur J. Goldberg: New Deal Liberal, 1996. On September 28, 1959, Eisenhower met privately with McDonald and Goldberg and threatened to invoke the back-to-work provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act. McDonald was unwilling to budge on Section 2(b) without other concessions from the steelmakers. The steel companies, realizing that they could wait until Eisenhower forced union members back to work, refused to make any such concessions. Invocation of Taft-Hartley Eisenhower set in motion the Taft-Hartley machinery on October 7 and appointed a Board of Inquiry. However, Eisenhower limited the Board's mandate to clarifying the issues rather than recommending a settlement. Realizing that the strike could linger despite the use of the Taft-Hartley provisions, management offered a three-year contract with small improvements in pay and fringe benefits and binding arbitration over Section 2(b). McDonald rejected the offer. He proposed a contract similar to his proposal of early July but reduced the union's wage and benefit demands and limited the contract to two rather than three years. Working from a plan devised by Goldberg, McDonald also proposed a nine-member committee consisting of three members from labor, management, and the public to study and resolve work-rule issues. Management rejected the new proposal. The Board of Inquiry issued its final report on October 19 and declared that there was no chance of a negotiated settlement. On October 20, the Department of Justice petitioned the federal district court for western Pennsylvania for a Taft-Hartley injunction ordering the steelworkers back to work. Goldberg argued that the Taft-Hartley Act was unconstitutional, but the district court ruled for the government on October 21. However, the court agreed to a stay of the injunction until the matter was fully settled. The union appealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia and lost again on October 27. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and set argument for November 3, 1959. Settlement with Kaiser Steel Meanwhile, a budding friendship between Goldberg and Kaiser Steel heir Edgar Kaiser led to an independent settlement between the union and Kaiser Steel on October 26. Although the Steelworkers won only a fractionally higher wage increase than the steelmakers had proposed, the settlement included the nine-member committee, proposed earlier by Goldberg and McDonald. Defeat in Supreme Court On November 7, 1959, on the 116th day of the strike, the Supreme Court upheld the appellate court's findings. In Steelworkers v. United States, 361 U.S. 39 (1959), in an 8‚Äì1 per curiam decision, the court upheld the constitutionality of the Taft-Hartley Act. The justices affirmed the district court's injunction, ordering the workers back to work for an 80-day cooling-off period. McDonald reluctantly ordered his members back to work, but productivity slowed from extremely poor relationships between workers and managers. The Taft-Hartley Act required management to make a last offer and for union members to vote on this proposal. Management proposed minimal improvements in wages and benefits and the elimination of Section 2(b). McDonald turned management of the union over to Goldberg to concentrate the legal and bargaining work in one set of hands. Goldberg convinced the leadership of the union to reject the proposal, and the members followed suit. Nixon's intervention Rejecting the contract was a dangerous tactic and could have broken the union if not for the support of Vice President Richard Nixon. Nixon planned to run for president in 1960 and offered his services in the hopes of negotiating a settlement, which might win him labor's backing. The Board of Inquiry, meanwhile, reconvened on November 10 and issued a second report on January 6, 1960. The major issues, the Board said, remained the size of the wage increase and Section 2(b). In December, Nixon met privately with the steelmakers and cautioned them that the Democratic Congress would soon begin hearings on the steel strike. Neither Republicans nor Democrats would support the steel companies if the strike triggered an election-year recession, and Nixon urged management to accept the terms of the Kaiser Steel settlement. Industry executives agreed to a new contract, similar to the Kaiser Steel settlement, in the last week of December. Settlement On January 15, a new 20-month contract was signed. Section 2(b) was preserved. Workers received a 7-cent an hour pay increase, 4.25 cents an hour lower than the Kaiser Steel settlement and far lower than anything McDonald had demanded. For the first time, however, the union won an automatic cost-of-living wage adjustment and greatly improved pension and health benefits. McDonald trumpeted the settlement as a great victory, compared to what might have happened.Seeger, \\"M'Donald Yields Union Presidency,\\" The New York Times, May 20, 1965. Impact In the long run, the strike devastated the American steel industry. More than 85 percent of U.S. steel production had been shut down for almost four months. Hungry for steel, American industries began importing steel from foreign sources. Steel imports had been negligible prior to 1959. But during the strike, basic U.S. industries found Japanese and Korean steel to be less costly than American steel even after accounting for importation costs. The sudden shift toward imported steel set in motion a series of events, which led to the gradual decline of the American steel industry. The strike also eventually ended McDonald's tenure as president of the Steelworkers. Eager to avoid a repetition of the 1959 strike, McDonald worked with steel industry executives to widen the mandate of the new nine-member commissions (now known as \\"Human Relations Committees\\"). A three-year national steel contract was signed on March 31, 1962. The union agreed not to enforce Section 2 (b) and permitted increased automation, with a percentage of the profits from automation going to wage increases. However, union members began to feel McDonald was not protecting their interests. In 1965, Iorwith Wilbur Abel challenged McDonald for the presidency of the union. The February 9 election was a bitter one. Voting irregularities and challenged ballots delayed a final result until April 30. Abel won by a razor-thin margin of 10,142 votes, out of 600,678 cast.\\"Abel Is Sworn in By Steelworkers,\\" The New York Times, June 2, 1965; Pomfret, \\"Abel Declared Victor in Steel Vote,\\" The New York Times, May 1, 1965.

The tower was built by the Canadian National Railway Company as Edmonton's first skyscraper, and at its completion in 1966 was the tallest building in Western Canada. The CN Tower would remain Edmonton's and Western Canada's tallest building until 1971 when it was surpassed by Edmonton House. History The building site was originally to the CNR Edmonton station which was constructed in 1905, and subsequently expanded in 1928. The CNR Station was demolished in 1953 and the area in which the expansion was constructed would become the spot the CN Tower would be constructed on in 1966. Former railway station that was demolished to make way for the tower. Plans for the tower would be announced in 1963, with construction started in fall of 1964. Allied Development Corporation of Calgary would hire Abugov & Sunderland to design, and Hashman Construction Company to build the CA$10.5-million CN Tower, which was Western Canada's tallest office tower when completed in October 1966. The opening ceremonies for the tower were attended by Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Grant MacEwan and Premier Ernest Manning. The CN Tower exemplified the modern International Style of architecture and is an early example of the tower-podium design. The CN Tower was purchased by the Calgary- based Strategic Group as part of a distress sale, and the last remaining Canadian National Railway employees moved out of the building in 2008. The Canadian National Railway logo is still found over the main entrance and on the top of the building. Canadian National sought to develop a second tower in Edmonton as part of a larger downtown redevelopment program, which would have been , 42-storey office tower in 1969, however the project was subsequently cancelled. Built to overlook the old Canadian National rail yard, the building's basement once housed Edmonton's main passenger railway station, until the Canadian National railway tracks leading to Downtown Edmonton were removed in 1998. Since then, passenger trains serving Edmonton have stopped at the Edmonton railway station situated near the former Edmonton City Centre Airport which ceased operations in 2013. The building suffered structural damage to the exterior on 18 July 2009, during a severe thunderstorm. Two vehicles were crushed by falling debris at the base of the building.

Biography Stanislav Lunev was born in Leningrad, to the family of a Soviet Army officer. He graduated from the Suvorov Military School in Vladikavkaz and then from Joint Arms High Command Military Academy. He then worked as a GRU intelligence officer in Singapore in 1978, in China from 1980, and in the United States from 1988. He defected to US authorities in 1992. Since then, he has worked as a consultant to the FBI and the CIA.Former Russian spy Col.

Through the Eyes of the Enemy: The Autobiography of Stanislav Lunev, Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1998. He also occasionally writes for online newspapers.Col. Stanislav Lunev in NewsMax.com In the book, he described his work as a Soviet spy. He said that his work was extremely successful because he followed a very basic rule that \\"the best spy will be everyone's best friend, not a shadowy figure in the corner.\\" In the book, he also described some active measures against the \\"Main adversary\\" and alleged that \\"the GRU and the KGB helped to fund just about every antiwar movement and organization in America and abroad.\\" According to Lunev, the Soviet Union allegedly spent more money on funding of U.S. anti-war movements during the Vietnam War than on funding and arming the Viet Cong forces. Nuclear sabotage operations Lunev is mostly known for his description of nuclear sabotage operations that have allegedly been prepared by the KGB and GRU against the western countries. It was known from other sources that large arms caches were hidden by the KGB in many countries for these planned activities. They were booby-trapped with \\"Lightning\\" explosive devices. One such cache, which was identified by Vasili Mitrokhin, exploded when Swiss authorities tried to remove it from woods near Bern. Several others caches were removed successfully.Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin (1999) The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West. Allen Lane. , page 475-476 Lunev asserted that some of the hidden caches could contain portable tactical nuclear weapons known as RA-115 \\"suitcase bombs\\". Such bombs have been prepared to assassinate US leaders in the event of war, according to him.Stanislav Lunev. Through the Eyes of the Enemy: The Autobiography of Stanislav Lunev, Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1998. These portable bombs can last for many years if wired to an electric source. ‚ÄúIn case there is a loss of power, there is a battery backup. If the battery runs low, the weapon has a transmitter that sends a coded message ‚Äì either by satellite or directly to a GRU post at a Russian embassy or consulate.‚Äù Lunev states that he had personally looked for hiding places for weapons caches in the Shenandoah Valley area and that \\"it is surprisingly easy to smuggle nuclear weapons into the US, either across the Mexican border or using a small transport missile that can slip undetected when launched from a Russian airplane. US Congressman Curt Weldon supported claims by Lunev but noted that Lunev had \\"exaggerated things\\" according to the FBI.Nicholas Horrock, \\"FBI focusing on portable nuke threat\\", UPI (20 December 2001).

When the invading troops were at the gates he sought asylum in the Turkish Legation, continuing to refuse to sign a declaration in support of the Italians. His personal courage impressed even the German minister, who successfully appealed to Rome to allow Frash√´ri to return home. Despite Italian guarantees, Frash√´ri was soon arrested and interned in Italy. Frash√´ri participated as \\"Honorary Chairman\\" of the Conference of Pez√´, where Albanian anti-fascist factors gathered in 1942, a fact that would be suppressed by the communist regime later. Frash√´ri, who had sympathy for the Germans partly because he had studied in Austria, worked with German minister , in the hopes of establishing closer relations and to gain some protection for the Albanians from the Italians. German occupation After the capitulation of Italy, Nazi Germany took control of the Balkans. The Germans were apprised of his significance and began to search for him immediately after the invasion. Frasheri was found and agreed, on 16 September, to return to Tirana for talks with Hermann Neubacher, Major and . After the end of the meeting, it was agreed that Albania would have its own sovereignty under Nazi Germany, similar to the Independent State of Croatia. Frash√´ri agreed to serve as regent as well as head the council. The leadership of the council was originally designed to rotate, but Lef Nosi declined for health reasons, and Anton Harapi argued that as a Catholic monk, he could accept no position in which he would be forced to sanction the death penalty. After World War II When the Partisans declared victory in Albania, the Germans evacuated, taking Mehdi Frash√´ri with them. Frash√´ri moved to Vienna and eventually settled in Rome, where he lived until his death.

A pulse storm is a single cell thunderstorm of substantial intensity which only produces severe weather for short periods of time. Such a storm weakens and then generates another short burst ‚Äì hence \\"pulse\\". __TOC__ Description Single cell thunderstorms ordinarily form in environments with low wind shear and moderate instability, with the low wind shear contributing to a short average lifespan of less than an hour. When the instability, calculated by Convective available potential energy (CAPE), is strong, the updraft will bring a larger amount of humid air very high above ground and generate a cumulonimbus cloud with high water and ice content. When the rain content, and even hail, falls from it, they can generate damaging winds brought about by downbursts. Rarely, a weak tornado develops in association with a pulse storm as the environment is only weakly sheared, or not at all. Life cycle Life cycle of a pulse storm. One can distinguish three stages in the evolution of a pulse storm: *formation: the upward current of the cell intensifies and allows the condensation of water vapor from the rising air parcel. This forms a cumulus congestus, then a cumulonimbus when ice crystals form at its apex which spreads horizontally in contact with the tropopause. *maturity: downdrafts are emerging. This stage is accompanied by characteristic phenomena such as lightning and thunder, showers (sometimes hail) and gust front. *dissipation: the cold pool descending from the cloud extends to the earth's surface and helps to block the feed by pushing the updraft downstream. The outflow can then serve as a trigger for other single cell thunderstorms.

Part of his School series, it was released by Simon & Schuster in 2002. Plot Mr. Maxwell, a fifth grade science teacher, is in charge of the school‚Äüs \\"Week in the Woods\\" program. He is an Eagle Scout and an avid outdoors man. He has organized and carried out this program for sixteen years. He is totally organized and prepared, months in advance, for the upcoming week in the woods, but there is something that he doesn't know, something that he cannot prepare for, which is trouble. Mark Chelmsley IV, a rich child living in New York, is unhappy about moving to a small town in New Hampshire. His parents work constantly and are extremely wealthy, but often spend very little with him. Mark is closer to Anya and Leon, a Russian couple employed as his family's maid and butler. Mark is assigned to Mr. Maxwell's class, where his know-it- all attitude, wealthy background, and lack of effort quickly turns Mr. Maxwell against him. At school, Mark chooses not to make friends, not to complete his work, not to even become involved, deciding that his time at school will be temporary and that he has nothing to gain. However, he gradually starts to become friends with other students in his class and develops a genuine interest in attending the \\"Week in the Woods\\", despite rudely rejecting Mr. Maxwell's initial offer. Mr. Maxwell reluctantly allows him to attend and Mark enjoys spending time in the woods with his new friends. As Mr. Maxwell and Mark's impressions of one another begin to improve, it is quickly derailed when a knife belonging to Mark's friend is found in their tent. Mark decides to take the blame, believing that Mr. Maxwell is looking for an excuse to send him away. When Mark's prediction proves to be true and he is told to go home early, Mark tries to prove that he can survive in the woods on his own. Mr. Maxwell soon realizes that he has been treating Mark unfairly when he discovers Mark did not bring the knife and is distressed to learn that Mark has disappeared into the woods. Though Mr. Maxwell finds Mark, he is injured and needs to rely on Mark for them to return safely to the campgrounds. They come to an understanding with one another during their return and promise to be more open to one another in the future.

It is located in an agricultural area on the southern side of the Ashburton River. Another river, the Hinds River, is to Valetta's southwest. Nearby settlements include Mount Somers to the northwest, Anama to the west, Mayfield to the southwest, and Punawai to the southeast. Its name is a misspelling of Valletta, the capital of Malta. Valetta was formerly served by the Mount Somers Branch, a branch line railway that diverged from the Main South Line at Tinwald, New Zealand, just south of Ashburton. On 3 October 1882, the Westerfield to Anama section of the line opened with a station in Valetta. Passengers ceased to be served by the railway on 9 January 1933 due to declining patronage as a result of increased private ownership of motor vehicles, but freight traffic stayed steady until after World War II. It then declined to the point where the line was no longer profitable and it officially closed on 1 January 1968, though wheat was railed from Valetta until April 1968. Some remnants of the railway still exist in and around Valetta: the station's goods shed, minor bridge abutments, and some of the line's formation.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 75-6.

The site on which it stood is now between North Marston and North Etting Streets, near 29th Street and Allegheny Avenue. Bellevue Mansion, looking south from Nicetown Lane in 1856. Painting by Edmund Darch Lewis. Bellevue Mansion in 1858 Charles Wharton purchased Bellevue in 1802 Bellevue was purchased from Thomas Ketland and his wife Elizabeth as a country estate in 1802 by Philadelphia merchant Charles Wharton (1743‚Äì1838), grandfather of industrialist Joseph Wharton. It was located about northwest of Philadelphia, just below the heights of Germantown. Deborah Fisher Wharton, daughter of Samuel R. Fisher, in the year she was married. Bellevue remained in the Wharton family for more than 60 years. In 1834 Charles Wharton gave the estate to his son William (1790‚Äì1856), who resided there in the summer with his wife Deborah Fisher Wharton for two decades raising their family. It was a working farm of , situated in rolling hills, with house, barn, sheds, vegetable gardens, orchards, fields, and farm animals. The manor house overlooked a small valley and brook that flowed into the Schuylkill River. Large willows, sycamores, and oaks dominated the house and landscape. Servants, mostly Irish, assisted with housekeeping and hired hands worked the fields and maintained the farm animals. The estate was surrounded by woods and estates of other wealthy Philadelphians. William Wharton, ~1840 Bellevue Mansion was large and roomy, constructed in stone, with two stories, basement, and widow's walk on the roof. Originally constructed by an Englishman who enjoyed dancing, it contained a large ballroom, used by the Wharton family as a game room. The family visited Bellevue often, entertaining many guests young and old. Paralleling the creek nearby was Nicetown Lane, leading about a half mile down to the Schuylkill River. William and Deborah were heavily involved in religious affairs of their Quaker Meeting and in the period 1825 to 1840 depended on Bellevue with its housemistress to keep their children occupied during the summer months. Joseph Wharton and his brother Charles and their siblings often walked down Nicetown Lane to the Schuylkill River, where they cooled off during the summer. Bellevue Mansion from the east.

Much of the estate near the train tracks had been sold, and some additional lots were purchased by the family south of Lamb Tavern Road. Starting in the 1840s, Bellevue was threatened by local development. In 1839, the Reading Railroad built its main line from Philadelphia to Norristown and north to Reading. The line ran about from the mansion on the north. The surrounding land, between Germantown and the city limits of Philadelphia, today's North Philadelphia, was relatively undeveloped, and in the period 1850 to 1880 entrepreneurs bought up many of the old estates for industrial sites and housing developments. To the younger generation of that time, the railroads represented progress, allowing anyone to travel quickly and boosting the economy of the region. This was especially true for Joseph Wharton and his siblings, who accepted such worldly improvements, and became immersed in the industrial economy. The trains were convenient, with a \\"Bellevue\\" station within a short walk of the mansion. But they also carried huge loads of coal, thundering by the house at inconvenient times, and the constant noise was annoying for guests staying at Bellevue. Although still a beautiful estate, its utility as a respite from city life would be limited. In 1854, Philadelphia expanded its borders to include the surrounding suburbs, and after the Civil War its population swelled to several hundred thousand. By 1870 the Centennial Exposition was upcoming, and Philadelphia was rapidly changing. It was suffering from a water crisis because it required more water, but there was no appropriate method for water purification and the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers were heavily polluted. Philadelphia's typhoid fever rate was among the highest in the nation, and most well-to-do families drank bottled spring water. Map of the Bellevue Estate in 1820, overlooking a small valley in which a brook flowed from Germantown down into the Schuylkill River. The family owned most of the land between Nicetown Lane and Ford Road. City of Philadelphia condemned what was left of the Wharton Estate for the \\"Cambria Reservoir\\". Newly planned streets in light blue. The house sat between 27th and 28th Streets, just north of Allegheny Ave. Although Bellevue had been threatened since the 1840s by the proximity of the nearby railroads, it was now threatened more directly. In the 1870s the entire Bellevue estate, then owned by Joseph Wharton and his siblings, along with several other estates nearby that had been annexed into the city, was threatened with condemnation by the city for the construction of the proposed Cambria Reservoir to hold potable water. The Wharton siblings were angry and frustrated that there seemed no recourse when the city chose their estate on which to build. Joseph Wharton saw a potential solution to the water problems. He started purchasing land in southern New Jersey in the 1870s, eventually acquiring in the Pinelands, which contained an aquifer replenished by several rivers and lakes. The water from the Pinelands was relatively pure and he planned to export the water to Philadelphia. Wharton suggested that a city-controlled company could develop the necessary water mains and pumps, funded by public purchase of stocks and bonds. There was opposition to the plan by others in Philadelphia and in New Jersey, and eventually a law was passed in New Jersey preventing the export of water. Map of the Bellevue Estate in 1840. The Reading Railroad built its Norristown line north of Bellevue Mansion, with the Bellevue station nearby. With this progress, the quiet of the estate was doomed and the family began selling off lots near the train right of way. A second rail line, constructed nearby in 1842, carried anthracite coal from northern Pennsylvania to large coal terminal on the Delaware River at Port Richmond. The Bellevue estate was taken by the city, but the planned reservoir was never constructed, because of local politics and also because by 1890 water could be purified by filtration, obviating the need for an extra reservoir. Instead Bellevue was sold to developers. It sat unmaintained and boarded up for a decade, and was finally demolished in construction of new housing for the newly organized industry nearby in North Philadelphia. Today, the location of Bellevue Mansion is a small playground between N. Marston and N. Etting Streets, just north of Allegheny Avenue in North Philadelphia.

The Tastykake factory stands across Hunting Park Ave. from where Bellevue Mansion stood, and Pep Boys is just down the street.

The location selected for the mall was elevated and overlooked a valley, and was close to an interstate highway, which would enable traffic flow to the mall, and future developments in the corridor. The mall opened in 1990, and was called the \\"Pavilions at Buckland\\". The mall was successful, and new businesses in the surrounding area developed. A multimillion-dollar renovation and expansion of the mall was completed in October 2003, and the name was changed first to \\"Buckland Hills Mall\\", and then to \\"The Shoppes at Buckland Hills\\". Design/Tenants One of the mall's entrances The main building has an area of on two floors. However, the name \\"Buckland Hills Mall\\"' can informally refer to the mall plus the cluster of surrounding retail stores, hotels, and restaurants on the hill, totaling nearly or 1/4 square mile. There are approximately 145 shops and eateries in the mall, as well as six anchor stores, including Macy's (originally G. Fox, later Filene's), Macy's Men's, Children's, Juniors, and Furniture (originally Steiger's, later Lord & Taylor, then Filene's Men's, Children's, Juniors, and Furniture), JCPenney, which opened in 1992, Dick's Sporting Goods (originally Sage-Allen), Sears, and Barnes & Noble. In 2006, Newbury Comics opened its first Connecticut store inside the mall. There was once a D&L; department store below the food court, which later became Filene's Men's Store and is now various shops and restaurants. The Shoppes at Buckland Hills is located off I-84, near the intersection of I-291.

With the temperature in Jerusalem often reaching 90 ¬∞F+ (32 ¬∞C) in July, the inside temperature of the courts exceeded 100 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C) on some days.  10th Maccabiah Games (1977) The United States team consisted of the top Jewish hardball squash players in the country. The team was led by Glenn Whitman, former captain and number one player at Harvard University. Other players included Len Bernheimer, a top ranked amateur who previously played in college at Williams, Roger Alcaly, and Bill Kaplan, the recent captain of Harvard's varsity squash team. The U.S. team was a heavy underdog, because none of the players had ever played any competitive softball squash, which is played on a wider court with a higher tin on the front wall and a much slower ball. Nevertheless, the U.S. team managed to earn a Silver Medal by upsetting both England and Australia before losing to South Africa in the finals.  11th Maccabiah Games (1981) Captained by Bill Kaplan, now a world-ranked squash player on the World Professional (hardball) Squash Tour (WPSA), the U.S. Squash Team eked out upsets again to earn a Silver Medal, falling to South Africa in the finals.

Unfortunately, Stew Grodman sustained heat exhaustion in an early round match in the 100+ degree courts and had to be taken to a hospital for intravenous therapy. South Africa again prevailed over the U.S. in the finals, leaving the U.S. with another hard fought Silver Medal. Another notable player on the team was Brian Roberts, former #1 player at the University of Pennsylvania, who would go on to turn his father's growing cable TV business, Comcast, into the leading player in the industry.

Also known as The Mad Scientist, Superman was produced by Fleischer Studios and released to theaters by Paramount Pictures on September 26, 1941. Superman ranked number 33 in a list of the fifty greatest cartoons of all time sourced from a 1994 poll of 1000 animation professionals,Beck, Jerry (ed.) (1994). The 50 Greatest Cartoons. Atlanta: Turner Publishing. and was nominated for the 1942 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Subject.Flixens  The Real Heroes of Superman, Part 3 Plot=Prologue The short's prologue sums up the origins of Superman, and are as follows: ‚ÄúIn the endless reaches of the universe, there once existed a planet known as Krypton; a planet that burned like a green star in the distant heavens. There, civilization was far advanced, and it brought forth a race of supermen, whose mental and physical powers were developed to the absolute peak of human perfection. But there came a day when giant quakes threatened to destroy Krypton forever. One of the planet‚Äôs leading scientists, sensing the approach of doom, placed his infant son in a small rocket ship and sent it hurtling in the direction of the Earth, just as Krypton exploded. The rocket ship sped through star-studded space, landing safely on Earth with its precious burden: Krypton‚Äôs sole survivor. A passing motorist found the uninjured child and took it to an orphanage. As the years went by and the child grew to maturity, he found himself possessed of amazing physical powers. Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, the infant of Krypton is now the Man of Steel: SUPERMAN! To best be in a position to use his amazing powers in a never-ending battle for truth and justice, Superman has assumed the disguise of Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper.‚Äù Main story The animated short The story cuts to the Daily Planet building, where editor Perry White reveals to his two best field reporters, Clark Kent and Lois Lane, that an anonymous figure has mailed another threatening note, threatening to use his ‚ÄúElectrothanasia-Ray‚Äù, to the Planet. White assigns Kent to help Lois follow up her lead, but Lois instead insists that she'd ‚Äúlike the chance to crack the story on [her] own.‚Äù Lois takes off in a private plane to an undisclosed location on the top of a mountain, where the villain's secluded lair/laboratory is located. He is preparing to fire his futuristic weapon (perhaps a particle beam or death ray), until his pet bird spots Lois's aircraft and alerts him. Upon her arrival, Lois is kidnapped, bound, and gagged, as the scientist boasts to her about the success of his plan, and then demonstrates the weapon's power by aiming it at a bridge and destroying it. While listening to the radio, Clark and the other journalists learn of the coming disaster, as the police alert everyone to stay in their homes. Instinctively, Clark steps into a storage room and changes into Superman before flying away. The Mad Scientist (voiced by Jack Mercer, voice of Popeye and Felix the Cat) then has the beam weapon weaken the foundations of the Daily Planet skyscraper, causing it to tip over. Fortunately, Superman arrives in time and prevents the structure from crashing into neighboring buildings or falling to the ground, successfully restoring the skyscraper to its upright orientation. Superman then pushes the death ray away from the base of the skyscraper and attempts to fight it back to the source, but the scientist increases the weapon's power, which also sends erratic ‚Äúpulses‚Äù of energy Superman's way. However, Superman remains determined to fight it, persevering against the beam and punching out each pulse as they come, gradually pounding the beam back to the scientist's lab. Seeing that the beam has been overpowered, the horrified Mad Scientist increases power, but Superman uses that against him by twisting the barrel of the weapon into a knot, preventing the beam energy from escaping, and the buildup of pressure causes the machine to overheat and explode. As the scientist's lab disintegrates with the weapon's demise, the scientist and his pet bird attempt to escape, while Superman arrives to rescue Lois. Superman then captures the scientist just before his lair explodes, and takes him to jail and a newspaper headline shows the capture of The Mad Scientist. The scene dissolves back to the Daily Planet building, where Clark Kent and Lois report back to Perry White. She has gotten a scoop on the story of the Mad Scientist with ‚Äúthanks to Superman‚Äù, and Perry commends her on doing it. Seeing she hasn't suspected a thing, Clark looks at the camera, winks, and nods to the audience, ending the story. Cast * Bud Collyer as Clark Kent / Superman * Joan Alexander as Lois Lane * Julian Noa as Perry White * Jack Mercer as the Mad Scientist * Jackson Beck as the Narrator, Radio Newscaster History=Production In early 1941, Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights to DC Comics' Superman property, created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.Maltin, Leonard (1980, rev. 1987). Of Mice and Magic. New York: Plume. Pg. 120 - 122 Paramount pitched the idea of producing a Superman series to its animation producer, Fleischer Studios. Co-owner Dave Fleischer did not want to take on the task of producing such a demanding series, he went up to Paramount and gave them a ridiculously high budget quota of $100,000 per cartoon - six times the cost of the Fleischers' black-and-white Popeye the Sailor cartoons, hoping to get Paramount to change its mind about the shorts. To his surprise, Paramount negotiated it down to a production cost of $50,000 for the first cartoon, and $30,000 for subsequent cartoons,Barrier, Michael (1999). Hollywood Cartoons. London: Oxford Press. Pg. 304. and Max and Dave began work on the first short in the series, Superman. Steve Muffatti was placed in charge of the first Superman short (at Fleischer and later Famous, the credited director actually served the roles typically ascribed to a film producer or supervising director, while the credited animators were the actual animation directors). Superman was produced with the same care and attention to detail the Fleischer staff had given to their first feature film, Gulliver's Travels (1939). While some of the scenes in the cartoon made use of the rotoscope, a Max Fleischer invention which allowed animation drawings to be traced from live action, others were done by relying upon poses sketched from live reference models instead of traced footage. Most of the lead character animators at Fleischer were used to animating caricatured humans and animals, and the assistant animators were tasked with maintaining the figures' realistic proportions. Character shadows, elaborate special effects animation, and detailed animation layouts contributed to the attention to detail evident in Superman and its follow ups. Paramount promoted Superman with a campaign highly unusual for an animated short, which was usually treated as a throwaway bonus on a movie theater's bill. The short was a notable success, and was nominated for the 1942 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons), which it lost to the Pluto cartoon Lend a Paw. Influence Animator Bruce Timm also was influenced to use Superman's vintage color scheme and film noir approach to the successful Warner Bros. television programs Batman: The Animated Series and Superman: The Animated Series. In both of these 1990s series, many of the character and background designs are based on the Fleischer Superman shorts. The scene where Superman disrupts the generator and causes the villain's lair to explode was used to some extent in the episode \\"Heart of Steel\\", where Batman attempts to thwart a plan by HARDAC to murder and replace humans with androids. A scene in which the background characters are shown as black silhouettes while Clark listens to the radio was similarly used in \\"Almost Got 'Im\\". The Iron Giant also references this short by playing the familiar motif at the mention of Superman. Public domain The rights to Superman and the other sixteen shorts in the Superman series reverted to National Comics (now DC Comics); TV syndication rights were licensed to Flamingo Films, distributors of the 1950s Adventures of Superman TV series. The cartoons fell into the public domain when National Comics failed to renew their copyrights in the late 1960s/early 1970s.

He is best known for having served as the personal secretary to Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, for 44 years.  Early life and education  Yehuda Leib Groner was born in New York City on April 25, 1931.Kaplan, Musia. \\"Rabbi Leibel Groner, z'l\\". Hamodia, May 6, 2020, p. 32. His parents were Rabbi Mordechai Avrohom Yeshaya Groner and Menucha Rochel Groner. His brother, Rabbi Yitzchok Dovid Groner, became the most senior Chabad rabbi in Melbourne, Australia, and the director of the Yeshivah Centre there. Groner was a direct descendant of Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the founding Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch. Groner studied at the Central Yeshiva Tomchei Temimim Lubavitch at 770 Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where he excelled as a student. He often spoke in learning with Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the future Lubavitcher Rebbe, who was then known as the son-in-law of the sixth Chabad Rebbe, Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, and had an office in the building. Groner's connection to Schneerson had begun at Groner's bar mitzvah celebration, where, as a guest, Schneerson had spoken for 1 hour and 20 minutes. In 1949, Schneerson asked Groner to join the team of Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch, working in the Kehot Publication Society, thus adding Groner to his secretariat. Secretary to the Lubavitcher Rebbe In 1951, Schneerson succeeded his father-in-law as the seventh Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch. After Groner married in 1954, the Rebbe asked him to become his personal assistant. Groner's role working for Schneerson was similar to that of a chief of staff. On April 13, 1984, the Rebbe referred to Groner as \\"my general\\". The Rebbe appointed Groner to run the Kupas Rabbeinu charity. Groner maintained his role until the Rebbe's death on June 12, 1994. After the Rebbe's death, Groner became a public speaker, traveling the world retelling many of his encounters with Schneerson.  Writing and teaching  Groner is a co-author, with Rabbi Volf Greenglass of Montreal, of Sefer HaMinhagim, the authoritative book describing Chabad-Lubavitch customs. He was also an editor of Otzar HaChasidim, the editorial group that publishes works on Chabad Hasidut. He taught at Beth Rivkah in Crown Heights, a school for girls who are part of the Chabad- Lubavitch community. Political views Groner was associated with a number of right-wing campaigns. In 2005 he was part of a delegation along with Menachem Brod who had a \\"heated debate\\" with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, pleading with him to not give away land, something he believed the nation of Israel would soon regret.  Personal life  In 1954, Groner married Yehudis Gurewytz. The couple had three sons and four daughters. Their son Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Groner is the rabbi of Congregation Ohr HaTorah in Charlotte, North Carolina, while another son, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Groner, is a Rosh Yeshiva at the Chabad Yeshiva in Kiryat Gat, Israel. Groner died on April 7, 2020, aged 88, after being infected with COVID-19 for several weeks. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the funeral took place in a more muted fashion with social distancing procedures in place. The Rabbinical Alliance of America released a statement mourning Groner as \\"one of the most prominent figures in Lubavitch of the last generation\\".

Career Following the breakup of the Minneapolis-based Suicide Commandos (in which he played bass), Steve Almaas moved to New York, turned to guitar and formed The Crackers; the band's EP Sir Crackers! (1981) indicates the rough-hewn melodic rock direction Almaas would later pursue. After working with The Bongos, Almaas, along with Bongos' leader Richard Barone, headed to North Carolina to visit Mitch Easter at his Drive-In Studio; the three of them put together the four-track Beat Rodeo EP, credited to Almaas and released in 1982 on Easter's Coyote Records label.Beat Rodeo EP liner notes (One of the tracks, \\"What's the Matter\\", later appeared on a compilation on the Shake Some Action label in 2003.) Almaas almost immediately formed a quartet named for the EP but not including Easter or Barone; the single \\"What's The Matter\\" b/w \\"Mimi\\" was issued by Coyote in 1983 (under the name The Beat Rodeo). The following year, Zensor Records in Germany issued the band's first LP, Staying Out Late With the Beat Rodeo, produced by Don Dixon, with two tracks helmed by Richard Gottehrer. The record, which shows a country bent implicit in its name (country-ish guitar sound, with a dash of fiddle), and integrates it into the already established pop-rock context. (A single, \\"She's More\\" b/w \\"Mistake\\" was also released; the group performed \\"She's More\\" on German television.) IRS Records signed the quartet and re-issued the album in 1985, shortening the band's name to simply \\"Beat Rodeo\\". In 1986, Beat Rodeo released their second album, Home in the Heart of the Beat, produced by Scott Litt; the LP produced two singles: \\"Everything I'm Not\\" b/w \\"It Could Happen Here\\" (\\"Everything\\" also appeared on a 12\\" promo disc with \\"I'm Not Afraid (Doesn't Matter to Me)\\" on the flip); and \\"New Love\\" b/w \\"Just Friends\\" (with videos made for both sides of the single; \\"Just Friends\\" had been previously released on Staying Out Late.) Although \\"Everything I'm Not\\" got some airplay at college stations, none of Beat Rodeo's albums or singles were hits, and IRS dropped them from the label; the band broke up soon thereafter. Almaas later went solo, and has released six albums to date; he also reformed the Suicide Commandos, who in 2017 released their first album in 38 years, Time Bomb. Beat Rodeo were mentioned in the acknowledgements of Elizabeth Wurtzel's memoir Prozac Nation.

Biography and work Lewis was born in Neath, where he joined the church choir and began learning the organ. He studied at the University of Wales, Cardiff, under Alun Hoddinott; with Gy√∂rgy Ligeti and Karlheinz Stockhausen at Darmstadt; with Bogus≈Çaw Schaeffer in Krakow and with Don Banks in London. He taught at Leeds College of Music (1969‚Äì72) and the University of Wales, Bangor (1973 - 1992), under William Mathias. Early performances included Fanfares with Variations and the Chamber Concerto with the BBC Welsh Orchestra under John Carewe, and, at the 1967 Cheltenham Festival, his Two Cadenzas for piano and Epitaphium - Children of the Sun for narrator, chamber choir, piano, flute, clarinet and percussion. BBC commissions included the orchestral works Mutations I (1969), Aurora (1973), Scenario (1975), Praeludium (1975), Memoria (1978) and Limina Lucis (1982). Other works include a Piano Concerto (1989), Duologue for violin and piano (1971), Scena for violin and piano (1988), Teneritas for flute and piano (1997), Sonante for clarinet and piano (1986 - for Thea King), Cantus for clarinet and piano (1996), a Piano Trio (1983), a Wind Quintet (1986), several mixed ensemble pieces including Time-Passage (1977), Stratos (1979), Epitaph for Abelard and Heloise (1979) and Litania (1993), piano works including Tableau (1980), Fantasy (1983), Threnody (1990 - all for Jana Frenklova), Trilogy (1992), Musica Aeterna (1997) and Sereno (2004), organ works including Mutations II (1971), Momentum (1977) and Esultante (1977 - these last two for Gillian Weir), Dreams, Dances and Lullabies for harp (1990), Silentia Noctis for high voice and piano (1989), and many choral works, notably Carmen Paschale (1981), Hymnus Ante Somnum (1985), Sequentia ad Sancte Michaele (1985), Westminster Mass (1990 - for Martin Neary), Recordatio (1999) and a sequence of eleven Sacred Chants (2005). Lewis's music is characterised by rhythmic energy and harmonic complexity alternating with extreme stillness; latterly his music has tended towards greater simplicity and tranquility and it often appears to inhabit a twilight world of dreams. However, he has achieved this simplicity through a process of constant refinement of his compositional technique, rather than any rejection of his earlier complexity. In 2005 Ivan March in Gramophone magazine described the CD release of Epitaph for Abelard and Heloise, Litania and Musica Aeterna as \\"...a disc not to be missed by anyone who cares about communicative 20th-century music.\\" ReferencesSources *Henshall, Dalwyn: ‚ÄúMemento Mori - An appreciation of Jeffrey Lewis‚Äôs recent orchestral music.‚Äù (Welsh Music, Vol 6 No 6, 1980 & Vol 6 No 7, 1981) *Jones, David: Notes for CD ASC CS CD43 ‚Äì Jeffrey Lewis: Threnody, Cantus, Teneritas, Sonante, Trilogy *Jones, David: Notes for CD CAMEO 2037 ‚Äì Jeffrey Lewis: Epitaph for Abelard and Heloise, Litania, Musica Aeterna *Jones, David: ‚ÄúA glimpse of infinity: time and stillness in the music of Jeffrey Lewis‚Äù (The Musical Times Vol.145 No.1889 (Winter 2004), pp. 65‚Äì74) *Tommis, Colin: ‚ÄúY Gitar Gymreig ‚Äì Jeffrey Lewis‚Äù (Guitar International, July 1989, pp 22 ‚Äì27) External links * Article about Jeffrey Lewis, A Glimpse of Infinity, in Musical Times, Winter 2004 * Welsh Music Information Centre Category:1942 births Category:Welsh composers Category:Alumni of Cardiff University Category:Academics of Bangor University Category:Living people Category:Academics of Leeds College of Music ","title":"Jeffrey Lewis (composer)"},{"id":"10132809","text":"Jim \\"Laz\\" Laslavic ( ; born October 24, 1951) is a former American Football linebacker who played ten seasons in the National Football League.

The term \\"genreflecting\\" was first coined by Betty Rosenberg, a prominent library science educator, in 1982.

History On October 6, 1980, the station first signed on as KTED.Broadcasting Yearbook 1981 page C-22 The station was originally owned by Salem Media and aired a Christian talk and teaching format. The studios were on East Kings Canyon Road. In 1982, the station was bought by Bilmar Communications.Broadcasting Yearbook 1988 page B-28 The Christian format ended and the station flipped to a beautiful music sound. The call sign switched to KEZL in 1986, with the EZ representing Easy Listening music. The KEZL call sign and easy listening format had been heard on 98.9 for many years before that station changed to KSOF, airing a soft adult contemporary format. By the 1990s, 96.7 KEZL made the transition to a smooth jazz format. The station was acquired by San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications in 2000.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2010 page D-86 Clear Channel was the forerunner to today's owner, iHeartMedia. The station was co-owned with \\"Alice 102.7,\\" which aired a mix of alternative rock and hot adult contemporary music. In 2006, management decided to swap formats and call letters, moving Alice KALZ to 96.7 while switching Smooth Jazz KEZL to 102.7. In 2012, iHeart management decided to take several of its most popular talk shows off Cumulus Media-owned 580 KMJ and use them on one of its own stations in the Fresno radio market.

Best known for his iconic photographs from the Sixties Classic Rock period, Elliott Landy was one of the first \\"music photographers\\" to be recognized as an \\"artist.‚Äù  Biography  A graduate of the Bronx High School of Science and The Baruch College of the City University of New York he began his photographic career working with Underground newspapers to express his own ‚Äòvisual voice‚Äù in support of the rising tide of anti-war sentiment throughout the United States during the late 1960s. His press pass and camera not only gave him access to the political scene but also provided him a personal entry into the new rock music counterculture. Albert Grossman who managed the careers of many of the most popular and successful performers of folk and rock music including Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Peter, Paul and Mary, Richie Havens and The Band had seen Elliott‚Äôs images of Janis Joplin and invited him to photograph The Band, Those photographs were used on the Music From Big Pink album. During this time, he met Bob Dylan and his photo of him appeared on the cover of the September ‚Äò68 edition of the Saturday Evening Post. Within the next few years his celebrated images included portraits of Bob Dylan (Nashville Skyline), The Band (Music From Big Pink), Janis Joplin (Big Brother & The Holding Company: Cheap Thrills), Van Morrison (Moondance), Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Joan Baez, Eric Clapton, Jefferson Airplane, Santana, Frank Zappa, John Lee Hooker and many others. His iconic photographs of Dylan and The Band during the years they resided and recorded in the small arts colony of Woodstock, NY and his coverage of the 1969 Woodstock Festival captured the attention of a new generation seeking spiritual and artistic freedom. His imagery has become synonymous with the town, the famed 1969 Music Festival and the Utopian spirit of the Woodstock Generation. Since 1967 Elliott‚Äôs work has been exhibited in galleries and museums worldwide and published on the covers of major US and international magazines and newspapers including the New York Times, Life, Rolling Stone and the Saturday Evening Post.

The town lies beside on the western edge of Lake Bumbunga and at the eastern foot of the Hummocks Range. The Augusta Highway, a section of Highway 1, runs on a strip between the township and the lake, which dwarfs the former. Name In 1869 the South Australian Governor Sir James Fergusson gave the Scottish name Lochiel to the site of this planned Government Town. It is the name given to the senior line of Chiefs of Clan Cameron ‚Äì the town being situated in the Hundred of Cameron, named after pioneer Hugh Cameron.Related names in Clan Cameron lands in the Scottich Highlands are those of Loch Eil [sic], a branch of the sea loch of Loch Linnhe; and the Fr√¨th Loch Iall (or Locheil Forest). History The Government Town of Lochiel was surveyed in 1869, closely following the proclamation of the cadastral Hundred of Cameron. The District Councils Act 1887 declared the township and the rest of the Hundred of Cameron a part of the District Council of Port Wakefield. The following year, lobbying by residents resulted in the Hundred of Cameron being moved from the control of Wakefield council into the jurisdiction of the District Council of Snowtown, cementing a close relationship between Lochiel and Snowtown rather than the more distant Port Wakefield. In 1976, a resident of a farm at Bumbunga, just east of Lochiel, declared a secessionist micronation, the Province of Bumbunga. By 1999 it no longer existed. In the 2011 Australian census, the population of Lochiel and adjacent farming communities was 362. Lochiel's community hall Governance The local government agency serving the town is Wakefield Regional Council following a transfer in 1997 from the District Council of Blyth-Snowtown. The town boundaries were formalised in 2000. An adjustment was made in 2007 to annex an eastern strip of Ninnes that had been within Wakefield Regional Council, the same local council as Lochiel, instead of the council governing the rest of Ninnes (District Council of Barunga West). The town lies in the state electoral district of Nurangga and in the federal electoral division of Grey. Economy In 1868, the potential of Lake Bumbunga's shallow waters for natural salt mining was recognised. Salt has been harvested from the lake bed in summer months since 1881, providing employment and other economic benefits for many years. After 1913, when the Australian Salt Company was incorporated, the company and its successors, latterly trading as Cheetham Salt, have held the lake leases continuously. Profitability was improved after a 9 kmGoogle Earth. branch line was built from the nearby broad-gauge railway line, enabling transport directly to Port Adelaide. Lochiel itself is said to have \\"developed slowly with the industry, its survival in the 20th century being almost totally dependent on the salt harvesting\\". In 2011, about 270 million tonnes of lignite (brown coal) were estimated to be in a deposit north of Lochiel in seven seams from 70 to 110 metres underground. The seams' thickness varied from 0.3 to 3.0 metres, for a total of 9.4 metres. The site was considered to be favourable because it lies only 6 km (4 mi) from the railway line to Adelaide, Darwin and Perth. The deposit was not subsequently developed. The \\"Loch Eel\\" sculpture in the shallows of Lake Bumbunga Attraction In 1972 a local man, Gary Taylor, and his friends created a sculpture of rubber tyres and plastic in the shallows of Lake Bumbunga 2.4 km north of the town (), to be visible from the main highway. They named it \\"Loch Eel\\" ‚Äì a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the supposed appearance of the Loch Ness Monster. Notes References Further reading Nicholls, Beryl F. (1969?).

It is an alternative to the Michigan left intersection.  Design  Left turns are prohibited at the main intersection, which therefore requires only a two-phase signal. Vehicles yield upon entry to the roundabout. If the roundabout has only two entrances, the entry from the main intersection does not have to yield. The roundabout diameter, including the center island and circulating roadway, varies from 90 feet to 300 feet depending on the speed of traffic on the approaches, the volume of traffic served, the number of approaches, and the design vehicle. This configuration would reduce delay for the arterial street, increase capacity, and reduce the number of stops required. The primary problem with such a configuration is driver disregard for the left turn prohibition at the main intersection. As yet no agency has designed a complete bowtie road junction.

It was destroyed by fire in 1958, at which point it was transformed into a multiplex facility for Black audiences. The 20 Grand was a place where people could go to dance, and see live performances on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. There was also a club night for youths. On the first floor of The 20 Grand there was a bowling alley and a fireside lounge that was used as a jazz room. On the upper floor there was a room called the Gold Room, which consist of a large banquet and a cabaret hall which could seat up to 1,200 people. There was a studio inside The 20 Grand built for Ernie Durham, a famous Detroit radio personality. There was also the Driftwood Lounge which was located next to the Golden Room, which was where most of the performances and shows took place. The Supremes, Chuck Jackson, Parliament- Funkadelic, Florence Ballard and Stevie Wonder performed there. Mick Jagger first saw B.B King perform here in 1964. There was a motel located next door where couples would check in after a long night out at the club.

She was a member of parliament for Harare North in the Parliament of Zimbabwe. She was also a founding member of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) of Zimbabwe, the first white woman to be voted into the MDC National Executive and, during her tenure, the country's only white female Member of Parliament.  Early life  Stevenson was born in Atlanta, Georgia in the United States, and attended school at Wymondham College in England from 1955 to 1962.Trudy Stevenson, the Zimbabwean Ambassador to the Republic of Senegal, returns to Wymondham College, Wymondham College, October 2012 She obtained a BA degree (French and Italian, joint honours) from the University of Reading and a Graduate Certificate in Education from the University of Zimbabwe.Stevenson profile in Parliament website She lived in Uganda during the 1970s, before fleeing from the regime of Idi Amin.She stood up to Mugabe ‚Äì but it was her party that did this, The Times, 5 July 2006 She moved to Zimbabwe in 1980, and became a Zimbabwean citizen in 1990.  Career  Stevenson held the position of Member of Parliament for Harare North from 2000 to 2008. She also served as MDC's national secretary for Policy and Research for both the original MDC and in a smaller faction of the MDC. She was quoted as saying \\"Mugabe does not frighten me, I feel it is my duty to stand up for the rights of all.\\" Stevenson was the chairperson of the Combined Harare Residents Association, and led the organisation's Supreme Court request for municipal elections in the city following the dissolution of the Harare City Council by the Ministry for Local Government due to corruption. The government-appointed city commissioners, initially appointed for a period of six months, were still in place two years later. The approach was successful, however before elections could be organised, President Mugabe declared that the city elections would be held simultaneously with the 2002 presidential elections. As a result of the short time frame for preparations the elections were chaotic and many eligible voters were not able to vote. Nevertheless the organisation considered their actions a success as they had forced the government to approve elections in the city. In 2005 Stevenson and several supporters left the MDC due to the increasingly violent tactics of Morgan Tsvangirai, the movement's leader and founder. She joined a breakaway faction led by former student activist Arthur Mutambara. In July 2006, after attending a political meeting in the Harare suburb of Mabvuku, Stevenson and four political colleagues were attacked by a mob. Stevenson suffered panga wounds to the back of her neck and head, broken arm and wrist bones and a fractured cheek bone. The leadership of the rival faction of the MDC immediately claimed that the attack was carried out by ZANU militants. However, while recovering in the hospital, Stevenson positively identified her assailants as members of the MDC-T faction, led by Tsvangirai.New Zimbabwe, Report on the attack on Mrs Stevenson Timothy Mubawu, a MDC Member of Parliament, was later charged with organising the attack.  Later career and death  In 2009, Stevenson was appointed as Zimbabwean Ambassador to Senegal and The Gambia, and was responsible for re-opening Zimbabwe's embassy in Senegal. She held the post even after the fall of the inclusive government in 2013. Stevenson was found dead by her chauffeur at her Dakar, Senegal residence on 24 August 2018. Personal Life Stevenson was the daughter of First Lieutenant Gilbert Hasbrouck Bevier Jr. (1924-1946), who was born in Kingston, New York and died suspiciously of a gunshot wound in Seoul, South Korea.

Salt has been mined there almost continuously since 1881. Description Lake Bumbunga's humorous sculpture, \\"Loch Eel\\", is visible from the northern approaches to Lochiel township The lake in late spring 2010, looking east from the rest stop on Highway 1 According to anthropologist Norman Tindale, the name Bumbunga derives from the Parnpangka (local indigenous) term for \\"rain water lake\\". Index compiled based on Easily visible from Highway 1 for a distance of 10 km (6 mi), the 15 square km (5.8 square mi) Lake Bumbunga is a dramatic departure from the surrounding landscape due to its seasonal pink colouration and wide expanse. The lake is the largest of a system of Quaternary Holocene saline lakes extending about 30 km (19 mi) north of Lochiel, draining an area to the east of the Barunga Range where it merges with the Hummock Range. Salt is dissolved from saline mud produced when winter rain fills the lake. Each summer a large portion of the lake dries up. Salt harvesting Salt harvesting at Lake Bumbunga in the late 1940s The salt works buildings about 1940 Salt is harvested by exposing salt water to the action of sun and wind to the point where it becomes saturated with common salt by evaporation. The less soluble salts, iron oxide and calcite, followed by gypsum, are precipitated out at this stage. The water is then pumped into crystallising ponds, where common salt precipitates. The process is stopped before all the salt comes down in order to avoid contamination with magnesium and potassium salts. The final liquors, known as bitterns, are drained away from the salt, which is then harvested. At Lake Bumbunga, brine is pumped into three 25 hectare (62 acre) crystalliser ponds for refining. The potential of Lake Bumbunga's shallow waters for salt harvesting was recognised in 1868. Salt was harvested from the lake bed in summer months from 1881; two years later, output was 6.1 to 8.1 tonnes (6 to 8 long tons) per day. Evaporation pans, furnaces, tank and men's quarters were built at the northern end of the lake. Mining provided employment and other economic benefits for many years; the town of Lochiel, on the west bank of the lake, is said to have \\"developed slowly with the industry, its survival in the 20th century being almost totally dependent on the salt harvesting\\". By 1910 there were at least three lease-holders scraping thousands of tons of salt from evaporation pans when the lake dried up ‚Äì usually in December. In 1913, the Australian Salt Company was incorporated and held all the lake leases until 1971, when the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cheetham Salt Company Limited ‚Äì now Cheetham Salt Limited, Australia's largest producer and refiner of solar salt. Efficiency of transportation was improved in 1926 after a 9 km (5.5 mi)Google Earth. branch line was built from the nearby Salisbury railway line, enabling transport directly to Port Adelaide. During the Second World War, when salt was need for munitions manufacture, employment rose from 30 workers to 100 working in three shifts a day and two trains a week transported the product in bags. In 1967, 1000 tonnes a day were harvested; at that time South Australia was producing 80 per cent of Australia‚Äôs salt, although that was soon to decrease with major expansion of solar salt production in Western Australia. Forty years later, average annual production was reported as 10,000 tonnes (11,000 tons). From 1996 to 2012, the works closed and no salt was harvested. With harvesting becoming practicable using only front-end loaders and trucks, the maintenance and salt works buildings became redundant and were demolished in 2000.

Construction on Phase 1 of the project, a 51-story, 678-foot tower with offices and condominiums, started in January 2020 and is expected to take 4 years. It will be built atop Boston's historic South Station complex, an example of transit-oriented development. The overall project will include condominium units, office space, a parking structure, and possibly hotel space. The property was initially proposed by Hines Interests and TUDC, a subsidiary of Tufts University. Part of Phase I, an expanded bus station, will use a foundation put in place when the station was last renovated, in the late 1980s, The high-use tower will be supported by a new foundation constructed in the area between the existing station and the tracks. Foot traffic will be rerouted around construction areas. History South Station Tower was planned to break ground in 2008, with completion scheduled to occur in 2010, but the project stalled. Approval has been obtained for a project totaling .Boston Redevelopment Authority project listing As of March 2016 the developer's website was updated stating the tower would begin construction early in 2017;https://www.hines.com/properties/south-station-boston the FAA had given approval in February for a tower reaching 677 feet.https://oeaaa.faa.gov/oeaaa/external/searchAction.jsp?action=displayOECase&oeCaseID;=257976489&row;=1 The developer's rights to build on the site were scheduled to expire in April 2017, but the state extended them until the end of the year. Construction was halted due to MBTA concerns, but Hines did not stop the project. Foundation piers for a future high-rise building, with posts spaced 35 feet apart, were installed between each pair of tracks during reconstruction of South Station in the mid-1980s. These will support the bus station expansion. New foundation piers will be constructed in the area between the current station and the tracks. Development of the airspace above the southbound tracks has been delayed several times. The building was conceived by Tufts president Jean Mayer, who foresaw an \\"epicenter of high-profile medical research\\" in downtown Boston. In 1991, Tufts created a for-profit development subsidiary, TUDC LLC, and acquired the rights to the airspace. Development over the past decade has been complicated by Boston waterfront zoning restrictions, which require pedestrian access to the waterfront. In 1997, TUDC brought on Hines Interests LP as a development partner. In 2006, TUDC and Hines filed a Development Plan for the project. Questions were raised in 2007 about the university's role in the project, and Tufts withdrew in 2009. South Station Tower was originally designed with a height of 759 feet (231 m), which included a decorative spire. However, the project was downscaled in 2006. In July 2016, the developer filed a \\"Notice of Project Change\\" with the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA), proposing a number of changes in the project, including the addition of more residential space. The notice included a timeline calling for construction of the project's first building, the high-rise tower, to begin in 2017. In December 2016, the board of the BPDA approved construction of the project. It was delayed to December 2017, then delayed again to 2018 due to MBTA rights. Construction officially began in February 2020, with a five year completion timeline. Design Preliminary design was done by architect Cesar Pelli, whose designs are reminiscent of his Wells Fargo Center in Minneapolis. The structure has been LEED pre-certified \\"silver\\" and won the EPA's \\"Green design\\" award.

Sir Horace Edmund Avory (31 August 1851 ‚Äì 13 June 1935) was an English High Court judge. Biography He was the son of Henry Avory, clerk of the Central Criminal Court. He was educated at King's College London, and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he was captain of boats and took the degree of LL.B. in 1874. He became a barrister of the Inner Temple in 1875 and married Maria Louisa Castle in 1877. He was elected Bencher in 1908 and was knighted and made a judge, later to become a senior judge, of the King's Bench division in 1910. He received a Hon.D.LL. degree in 1911 and was made Treasurer in 1929. He died at Rye, East Sussex. \\"slim\\" Avory KC as caricatured by Spy (Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair, June 1904 Avory was one of the most noted English criminal lawyers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was involved in many sensational trials and became a household word as the most dreaded \\"hanging judge\\" of his age. He was called \\"thin-lipped, cold, utterly unemotional, silent, and humorless, and relentless towards lying witnesses and brutal criminals\\" and \\"impervious to bluff and merciless to perjury\\". He was nicknamed \\"The Acid Drop\\" in legal circles, due to his caustic wit in court. In private life, however, he showed a different face. Famous cases in which he appeared to include the trials of Adoph Beck, Sir Roger Casement, Oscar Wilde (as prosecuting counsel), Jean-Pierre Vaquier,O'Donnell (1935) p.190 Patrick Mahon and Clarence Hatry. His prosecution of Adolph Beck contributed to one of the most significant miscarriages of justice in English legal history. Beck was wrongly identified by ten women as a swindler and was sentenced to seven years. In recognition of his achievements, both Corpus Christi College (Cambridge), and The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple have student scholarships in the name of Horace Avory. A portrait in oils by Charles Freegrove Winzer is owned by Corpus Christi. Death According to Time magazine's report of his death, \\"Avory had gone for a chill walk during his Whitsuntide holiday.

Mirror image storm splits are found in environments where there are large amounts of crosswise vorticity (i.e. the hodograph is straight, rather than curved) are present. Storm splits also occur in environments where streamwise vorticity is immediately present to an updraft (i.e. right or left curve to the hodograph), however in this situation one split is highly favored over the other, with the weaker split quickly dying; in this case, the lesser favored split may be so weak that the process is not noticeable on radar imagery.  Dynamics = Idealized example  Consider an idealized environment where easterly winds are present at the surface. Ascending through the vertical column, the wind profile strongly veers resulting in calm winds in the mid levels and strong westerlies in the upper levels. A hodograph in this environment would be presented as a straight line (starting to the left (west) of the origin, crossing straight through the origin, then ending some distance to the right (east) of the origin. This environment would produce large amounts of crosswise vorticity (via the right hand rule, vorticity with an axis of rotation perpendicular to the environmental flow). As an updraft begins to form, it will tend to tilt the crosswise vorticity lines into the vertical, resulting in an anticyclonic vorticity axis on the northern fringe and a cyclonic vorticity axis on the southern fringe of the updraft. At this point, despite vorticity lines being oriented in the vertical, the storm can not be considered a supercell, as the areas of rotation are outside of the main updraft. Due to the short time scale (scale analysis reveals the Coriolis acceleration in the vorticity equation is negligible on short time scales http://envsci.rutgers.edu/~broccoli/dynamics_lectures/lect_18_dyn10_scaling_vort.pdf \\"Scaling of the Vorticity Equation\\" -Lecture), the areas of vorticity result in low pressure (perturbations) on the flanks of the convective updraft. Given favorable environmental thermodynamics (sufficient buoyancy and negligible convective inhibition {CIN}https://www.weather.gov/media/lsx/science/spring09.ppt) these pressure perturbations will induce mass flux from below, initiating new convective updrafts. These new updrafts are now located \\"off\\" the hodograph, with one to the left and one to the right, both co-located with the previously mentioned pressure perturbations. The updraft can now enhance the vorticity (by as much as several orders of magnitude) through stretching. Additionally, since both new updrafts are now located off the hodograph, a streamwise vorticity component (quantifiable as Storm Relative Helicity...SRH) is able to be ingested into the storm (with the anticyclonic split ingesting negative SRH and the right split ingesting positive SRH). Each split now contains a rotating updraft and can be considered a supercell. In this idealized environment, as new updrafts are initiated due to the pressure perturbations from the original split, additional crosswise vorticity will be tilted into the vertical on the flanks of the new updrafts. This will result in the continuation of the process that results in splitting, with a continuous propagation of new updrafts to the right and left of the hodograph. This allows each split to start the process over, splitting again and again until the environmental vertical wind shear no longer favors splitting supercells, or the storms have moved into an unfavorable thermodynamic environment.  Real world variations  Hodographs shapes are rarely a straight line; however, some are close enough to the idealized example that mirror image splits will appear in radar imagery. In most cases, however, there is usually a slight curvature in the hodograph, which tends to favor one split over the other. Take, for example, a hodograph that carves out a shallow right curve. Both crosswise and streamwise vorticity are present in this environment. As with the idealized environment, crosswise vorticity lines are tilted into the vertical on the flanks of this updraft. Once the pressure perturbations initiate new updrafts on the flanks and they begin to rotate as a result of stretching and ingestion of newly experienced streamwise vorticity. The right split, having propagated even farther right to the hodograph, has increased the magnitude of positive SRH ingestion. This will serve to increase the rotation in the updraft, intensifying the pressure perturbation, strengthening the storm. On the other hand, the left mover, rotating anticyclonically, is struggling to maintain its updraft since it is ingesting positive environmental SRH. In this case, the left split will tend to weaken, as the right split becomes dominant. In extreme cases, where there is a strongly curving clockwise hodograph, the left mover will be so weak from the start, the splitting process will not be evident on radar, and dominant right movers will immediately be present shortly after convective initiation. Dominant left movers are rare, as a hodograph containing a counter-clockwise curving hodograph indicates backing winds and CAA, which does not favor ascent.

History= Regulation and administration of elections  The administration of democratic elections in Nigeria dates back to the period before Independence when the Electoral Commission of Nigeria(ECN) was inaugurated in 1958 to conduct the 1959 federal elections. Prior to 1958, regional laws and government regulated and conducted elections. ECN was headed by an expatriate, Ronald Edward Wraith and four Nigerian members representing each region and the Federal Capital Territory of Lagos. The Federal Electoral Commission (FEC), established in 1960 conducted the immediate post-independence federal and regional elections of 1964 and 1965. Prior to the conduct of the 1964 election, the Chief Electoral Officer, Kofo Abayomi resigned and some party officials from the NCNC and Action Group doubted the credibility of a free and fair election. The electoral body was dissolved after the military coup of 1966. In 1978, the Federal Electoral Commission(FEDECO) was constituted by the regime of General Olusegun Obasanjo, organizing the elections of 1979 which ushered in the Nigerian Second Republic under the leadership of Alhaji Shehu Shagari. It also conducted the general elections of 1983. In December 1995, the military government of General Sani Abacha established the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria which conducted another set of elections. These elected institutions were not inaugurated before the sudden death of General Abacha on June 1998 aborted the process. In 1998, General Abdulsalam Abubakar's Administration dissolved NECON and established the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). INEC organized the transitional elections that ushered in the Nigerian Fourth Republic on May 29, 1999. In January 2015, the \\"#BringBackOurGirls group raised the alarm over plans by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to exclude Chibok and some communities currently under the control of the Boko Haram from getting the permanent voter cards (PVCs) for the February elections.\\" = Leadership = The Chairman of the first Nigerian Federal Electoral Commission was Chief Eyo Esua (1964‚Äì1966) in the First Republic. When General Olusegun Obasanjo prepared for a return to civilian power in the Second Republic, he established a new Federal Electoral Commission headed by Chief Michael Ani to supervise the 1979 elections. Ani was succeeded by Justice Victor Ovie Whisky. During the Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha regimes, which attempted returns to democracy, the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria was headed by Professor Eme Awa (1987‚Äì1989), Professor Humphrey Nwosu (1989‚Äì1993), Professor Okon Uya and Chief Sumner Dagogo-Jack (1994‚Äì1998).  INEC  General Abdulsalami Abubakar established the current INEC, with Justice Ephraim Akpata as chairman. Akpata had to deal with 26 political associations, giving only nine provisional registration as political parties for the 1998/1999 elections, eventually whittled down to three parties. Despite efforts to ensure free and fair elections, the process drew serious criticism from international observers. After Akpata died in January 2000, the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed Abel Guobadia Nigeria's Chief Electoral Officer, a position that was confirmed by the Nigerian Senate in May 2000. Guobadia was responsible for the 2003 elections, which were marred by widespread violence and other irregularities. In June 2005, Guobadia retired and was succeeded by Professor Maurice Iwu. Soon after being appointed, Iwu announced that foreign monitors would not be allowed during elections, but only foreign election observers. This decision was condemned by politicians and civil society groups who called for his immediate removal from office. The conduct of the 2007 elections was again criticized as falling below acceptable democratic standards. On 8 June 2010, Professor Attahiru Muhammadu Jega was nominated by President Goodluck Jonathan as the new INEC Chairman, subject to Senate confirmation, as a replacement for Iwu, who had vacated the post on 28 April 2010. Jega's nomination as INEC chairman followed approval by a meeting of the National Council of State called by President Jonathan and attended by former heads of state Yakubu Gowon, Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Babangida, Abdulsalami Abubakar, Ernest Shonekan, Olusegun Obasanjo and Shehu Shagari. The Senate President David Mark, Speaker of the House of Representatives Oladimeji Bankole, and most of the state Governors also attended the meeting. Unanimous approval by the council of the nominee for this critical appointment avoided controversy about whether or not the President should appoint the chairman of the INEC. Reactions to the announcement from a broad spectrum of political leaders and organisations were positive, although some voiced concern that it could be too late to implement real reforms before the 2011 elections. During the campaign for the 2015 Nigerian general elections, Attahiru Jega \\"faced fierce criticism from both the opposition and the ruling party.\\" Attahiru Jega's five-year term came to an end on June 30, 2015, and though he was qualified for re-appointment, the chances of such became remote given the allegations of bias against him by campaign officials of President Goodluck. President Mohammadu Buhari appointed Professor Mahmood Yakubu as INEC Chairman, Professor Yakubu took over from Amina Bala-Zakari, who was the acting chairman after Jega left. Controversies The INEC has encountered several controversies in the run-up to elections in the country, most notably the April 2007 general elections, including criticism about its preparedness from Sada Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto and a dispute over its \\"disqualification\\" of Vice president Atiku Abubakar's candidacy. The Supreme Court ruled that the INEC can not disqualify candidates, so Abubakar's name was added to ballots at the last minute. On the subject of election irregularities, INEC spokesman Philip Umeadi said on April 19 that \\"We are not sitting on any crisis in Nigeria.\\". The mission of INEC is to serve as an independent and effective EMB committed to the conduct of free, fair and credible elections for sustainable democracy in Nigeria. The vision of INEC is to be one of the best Election Management Bodies (EMB) in the world that meets the aspirations of the Nigerian people. In the buildup to 2015 general elections, INEC under Jega introduced smart card reader for the verification of voters and their voting cards to minimize incidence of fraud and rigging. The introduction of card readers was hailed by many Nigerians but a group of four minor political parties who claimed to be acting on behalf of 15 political parties kicked against it and urged INEC to suspend the use of card reader in the 2015 elections. The 2015 general elections were adjudged the most credible, free and fair election since the return of democracy in 1999. INEC was accused of widespread electoral irregularities in the 2019 presidential elections including cases of ballot paper unavailability, smart card readers malfunctioning and large cancellation of valid votes. The main opposition People's Democratic Party and its presidential candidate challenged the results of the election in court.

Jackson, Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington. Jackson plays an LAPD police officer who terrorizes his new next-door neighbors because they are an interracially married couple. The title is a reference to the ethnically-mixed middle class Los Angeles neighborhood of Lake View Terrace. The film was released on 19 September 2008, received mixed reviews and grossed $44 million. Plot An interracial newlywed couple, Chris and Lisa Mattson (Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington) are moving into their first home. Chris‚Äôs first exchanges with their neighbor, widowed and longtime LAPD officer Abel Turner (Samuel L. Jackson), have somewhat hostile undertones, with Abel making comments about Chris‚Äô smoking (which Abel later exposes to Lisa) and listening to hip hop music, and making remarks about his ethnicity in his interracial relationship to Lisa. The following night, Chris and Lisa have sex in their swimming pool. Unknown to them, Abel's children, Marcus and Celia (Jaishon Fisher and Regine Nehy), watch them. Abel arrives home and witnesses the spectacle. Angry, he re- positions his home security floodlights to shine into Chris and Lisa's window, keeping them awake. Abel begins to insinuate to Chris that he disapproves of his interracial marriage and that he wants them to move out of their new neighborhood. One evening, Chris and Lisa hear noises downstairs and find the tires on Chris' car slashed. Suspecting Abel, they call the police, who are unable to do anything because of Abel's status within the LAPD. Chris retaliates by shining his own floodlights into Abel's bedroom. Lisa later reveals she is pregnant, creating conflict with Chris, who does not yet want children. Meanwhile, Abel is suspended without pay for abusing a suspect, inciting more fury within him. Abel continues his harassment of the couple by hosting a loud bachelor party with his colleagues where he forces Chris to be sexually harassed by a stripper. Chris later plants trees along the fence between their properties, which leads to a near-violent exchange, as Abel objects to having trees hanging over his property. When Chris goes to a local bar, Abel enters and tells Chris that his own wife died in a traffic accident because she was having an affair with her white male employer, and that he distrusts white men and is prejudiced against interracial relationships because of this. Abel sends his informant, Clarence Darlington (Keith Loneker), to trash the Mattson's home in another effort to force them out. Lisa arrives home early, surprising Clarence. They struggle and Lisa is knocked out, but not before she triggers the alarm. Chris races home, followed by a frustrated Abel. When Abel comes upon his hired criminal, he fatally shoots him to keep him quiet. Lisa is rushed to the hospital, but is okay. Wildfires are raging in the surrounding hills and the residents are instructed to leave their homes. Abel, who remains behind, enters the Mattsons' home, hoping to retrieve Clarence's dropped cell phone, fearing that it will incriminate him. Lisa and Chris unexpectedly return from the hospital before Abel finds the phone, and he leaves. While the Mattsons pack to evacuate, Chris finds the cell phone. He calls the last number dialed and hears Abel answer. Chris realizes Abel is responsible for the break-in, and Abel realizes Chris has discovered the phone. Abel goes over with his gun drawn, and he and Chris struggle. Before Lisa can escape, Abel shoots her car, causing her to crash into a parked vehicle. After pistol whipping Abel and seemingly knocking him out, Chris tries to free Lisa from the car. Abel fires his gun at Chris but misses, and Chris holds Abel's other gun at him while telling him to stay back. Hiding his gun in the back of his pants, Abel insists he is unarmed when county sheriff officers arrive on the scene. The police demand Chris drop his gun, while ordering Abel not move any further, uncertain of who the aggressor is. His wife begs him to comply and Abel tells him to listen to her. Chris retorts that Abel should have listened to his wife and asks if he saw her betrayal coming, implying that his illiberal attitude drove her to be unfaithful. Enraged, Abel takes out his hidden gun, shoots Chris in the shoulder, and is immediately shot to death by the deputies. Chris survives and he and Lisa later talk about their pride in their home, neighborhood, and soon-to-be family, while the wildfires finally seem to be contained.

The film grossed $39.2 million in the United States and Canada and $3.2 million in other territories, making $42.4 million worldwide. Real life inspiration The plot was loosely based on real life events in Altadena, California involving an interracial couple, John and Mellaine Hamilton, and Irsie Henry, an African-American Los Angeles police officer. The saga was documented in a series of articles in both the Pasadena Star News and the Pasadena Weekly beginning in 2002.

It was first performed at the Lyric Theatre in London on 10 May 1973, with Alec Guinness in the central role. It ran, with cast changes, until 10 August 1974.\\"Theatres\\", The Times, 10 August 1974, p. 10 The Broadway production that followed was less successful, running for less than three months. The play has been revived several times since then, in London and elsewhere. The action revolves around the (generally) thwarted libidos of the principal characters. The title of the play is an old legal term habeas corpus, which translates from Latin as \\"you shall have the body\\".\\"Habeas corpus\\", Oxford English Dictionary, retrieved 14 August 2016 Background Having made his reputation as a co-writer of and performer in Beyond the Fringe, Bennett turned to writing full-length plays. Habeas Corpus was his third to be staged in the West End. It followed Forty Years On (1968) and Getting On (1971), which were described by the critic Michael Billington as \\"two elegiac comedies about the decline of England\\".Billington, Michael. \\"Alan Bennett's 'Habeas Corpus'\\", The Guardian, 11 May 1973, p. 10 In the new play Bennett's comedy became farcical: Billington called it \\"a gorgeously vulgar but densely plotted farce\\". Original cast *Arthur Wicksteed, a General Practitioner ‚Äì Alec Guinness *Muriel Wicksteed, his wife ‚Äì Margaret Courtenay *Dennis Wicksteed, their son ‚Äì Christopher Good *Constance Wicksteed, the doctor's sister ‚Äì Phyllida Law *Mrs Swabb, a cleaning lady ‚Äì Patricia Hayes *Canon Throbbing, a celibate ‚Äì Roddy Maude-Roxby *Lady Rumpers, a white settler ‚Äì Joan Sanderson *Felicity Rumpers, her daughter ‚Äì Madeline Smith *Mr Shanks, a sales representative ‚Äì Andrew Sachs *Sir Percy Shorter, a leading light in the medical profession ‚Äì John Bird *Mr Purdue, a sick man ‚Äì Mike Carnell Directed by Ronald Eyre, designed by Derek Cousins; music by Carl Davis.Bennett, pp. 7‚Äì8 In February 1974 Robert Hardy succeeded Guinness as Dr Wicksteed, and the author took over the role of Mrs Swabb.\\"Briefing\\", The Observer, 3 March 1974, p. 33 Plot The action takes place in and around the Wicksteeds' house in Hove, on the south coast of England.Bennett, p. 7 Mrs Swabb, who combines the functions of cleaner and all-knowing Fate, introduces the main characters. Wicksteed is 53, has an eye for the ladies and lacks ambition; his wife, Muriel, is a more assertive figure; their son, Dennis, is a wimpish hypochondriac, frustrated at his lack of a girlfriend; Connie is a flat-chested spinster who secretly longs to be sexually alluring; Sir Percy Shorter, President of the British Medical Association, was once Muriel's sweetheart and he bears a grudge against Wicksteed for cutting him out; Lady Rumpers is a returning expatriate, concerned for the purity of her beautiful daughter Felicity; Canon Throbbing is anxious to abandon his celibate state, which he finds a strain to keep up.Bennett pp. 11‚Äì16 Meeting Felicity for the first time, Wicksteed is instantly consumed with lust for her, and attempts to arrange a t√™te-√†-t√™te. Muriel finds her old feelings for Shorter rekindled and she too plots a rendezvous. A parcel arrives for Connie: it contains a pair of false breasts. Felicity makes a pass at Dennis and they go off together. Mr Shanks, the fitter from the false-breast manufacturer, arrives and mistaking Muriel for his client rhapsodises about and handles her substantial bust, until realising his mistake. Muriel, aroused to a predatory frenzy, pursues Shanks until interrupted by the arrival of Shorter, who misreading the situation injects Shanks with a powerful tranquilliser. Connie has put on her padded breasts, which make her feel suddenly attractive and confident to the point of brazenness. She mistakes Shorter for the fitter, and invites him to handle her bust. He is aroused and is discovered trouserless by Canon Throbbing, whom he attempts to tranquillise, pursuing him offstage with a hypodermic. Dennis and Felicity declare their intention to marry, but he is sent away by Wicksteed, who then attempts to seduce Felicity. Shorter catches him in the act and threatens to have him disciplined and barred from medical practice. Muriel joins in the denunciation and the uproar is increased by a suicide attempt by Wicksteed's patient Mr Purdue, who is trying to hang himself as Lady Rumpers enters.Bennett, pp. 17‚Äì44 Act Two continues the action from the same point. Lady Rumpers removes Felicity, Muriel tells Wicksteed to leave the family home, Throbbing and Shorter argue about which of them is to marry Connie until she enters without her prominent false bust, at which Shorter renounces her. Muriel relents and allows Wicksteed to remain, provided he resumes his long-neglected conjugal duties. Shanks comes round from the tranquiliser administered by Shorter and denounces Muriel as a sex-maniac. Wicksteed tells her that it is now she who must leave the family home. Lady Rumpers arrives to remove Felicity, who has returned to find Dennis. It emerges that Felicity has just had sex with Dennis. She finds him repulsive, and has agreed to marry him only because she is already pregnant, wants an official father for her child, and has been led to believe that Dennis has a fatal illness that will soon leave her as a widow. Lady Rumpers is aghast and reveals that history is repeating itself: she was seduced when young and made a marriage of convenience to give Felicity a legal father. Shorter makes a casual comment that leads to the discovery that he was the seducer and is Felicity's father. Wicksteed, having the upper hand, forces Shorter to back down over his disciplinary threat. It emerges that Dennis's imagined fatal illness is real, and Felicity agrees to go ahead with the marriage. Throbbing and Connie also pair off, and Wicksteed is left alone to reflect on the transience of human life and the importance of seizing sexual opportunities whenever possible: \\"He whose lust lasts, lasts longest\\". The stage goes dark; a spotlight plays on Wicksteed, who \\"dances alone in the spotlight until he can dance no more.\\"Bennett, pp. 45‚Äì75 Revivals A Broadway production opened in November 1975 and ran until February 1976. It starred Donald Sinden as Wicksteed, with a cast including June Havoc, Celeste Holm, Jean Marsh, Ian Trigger, Rachel Roberts and Richard Gere.Hischak, p. 183 The author attributed the comparative failure of the production ‚Äì a run of 95 performances ‚Äì to the heavily naturalistic staging by Frank Dunlop and Carl Toms, which he felt slowed down the action. The London production had been on a bare stage with only three chairs; Bennett thought this the only way of staging the work: \\"There is just enough text to carry the performers on and off, provided they don't dawdle. If they have to negotiate doors or stairs or potted plants or get anywhere except into the wings, then they will be stranded halfway across the stage, with no line left with which to haul themselves off\\".O'Mealy, p. 13 Later revivals have included productions by Sam Mendes, with Jim Broadbent as Wicksteed (Donmar, London, 1996),Taylor, Paul. \\"Habeas Corpus, Donmar Warehouse, London\\"; The Independent, 7 June 1996 Peter Hall, with James Fleet (Theatre Royal, Bath, 2006);Billington, Michael. \\"Habeas Corpus/Miss Julie\\", The Guardian, 15 July 2006 and David Thacker, with Rob Edwards (Octagon, Bolton, 2011).\\"Habeas Corpus\\", Octagon Theatre, retrieved 14 August 2016 Critical reception The play has divided critical opinion from the outset. In The Times, Irving Wardle thought that Bennett had difficulty in inventing a full-length play that would \\"sustain his wry, oblique talent\\", although this play was \\"his most successful experiment so far\\".Wardle, Irving. \\"Habeas Corpus\\", The Times, 11 May 1973, p. 11 In The Guardian, Billington's praise was less guarded, although he found \\"the diagrammatic neatness of the plotting ultimately becomes slightly oppressive\\". In The Daily Express Herbert Kretzmer commented that the author \\"tries too hard to do too much\\", although he predicted a long run for the play.Kretzmer, Herbert. \\"What the doctor ordered\\", The Daily Express, 11 May 1973, p. 10 When the play opened on Broadway, hostile notices outweighed the favourable. Clive Barnes of The New York Times pronounced the piece \\"slight and boring\\"; Howard Kissel commented more approvingly, observing, \\"farce is an enterprise whose esthetics are not always appreciated by the undiscerning\\".Quoted in O'Mealy, p. 13 The literary scholar Joseph O'Mealy writes that Habeas Corpus, like Tom Stoppard's Travesties which was staged a year later, was strongly influenced by Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest. O'Mealy finds echoes of Wilde's Lady Bracknell and Gwendolen in Lady Rumpers and Felicity, and of Wilde's linguistic absurdities in some of Bennett's dialogue. He identifies Joe Orton's 1969 farce What the Butler Saw as another influence.O'Mealy pp. 13‚Äì14 Although the play is farcical for most of its length, the ending is equivocal, and some have seen Wicksteed's solitary, spotlit dance as a dance of death.O'Mealy, p. 16 Billington emphasises the farcical side of the piece, whereas the critic Ronald Bergan views it as \\"rather more a wake than a celebration\\".

Award The medal is an antique silver colored roundel suspended from a white and green ribbon that is in turn suspended from a bar. The medal is inscribed with a compass rose with the BSA universal badge at the top and the word RANGER at the bottom. A powderhorn is in the center on a green enameled background. The bar is inscribed with RANGER. The Ranger bar is available as a separate item for informal uniform wear. As of 2012, there is no square knot insignia and no plans to add one, as the Venturing Summit is the highest award in Venturing and thus the only award on par to have a knot with Eagle Scout (Scouts BSA program), Quartermaster (Sea Scout program), and Arrow of Light (Cub Scout program). Requirements To earn the Ranger Award, Venturers must complete requirements similar to Merit Badges, although they are more difficult to complete. For example, an Eagle Scout must earn the first aid merit badge, by becoming certified in standard first aid. To earn the first aid elective, a Ranger must complete a 24-hour emergency first aid course and the Red Cross When Help is Delayed Module. There are eight requirements, called Core Requirements, that must be earned by all Ranger Candidates. In addition, a Venturer must complete four out of eighteen requirements, called Electives. Core requirements To earn the Ranger Award, all Venturers must earn the following awards: # First Aid # Communications # Cooking # Emergency Preparedness # Land Navigation # Leave No Trace # Wilderness Survival # Conservation Electives To earn the Ranger Award, Venturers must earn four of the following: # Backpacking # Cave Exploring # Cycling/Mountain Biking # Ecology # Equestrian # First Aid (Different from the Core Requirement) # Fishing # Hunting # Lifesaver (Lifeguarding) # Mountaineering # Outdoor Living History # Physical Fitness # Plants and Wildlife # Project COPE # Scuba # Shooting Sports # Watercraft # Winter Sports Origins The first Ranger Medal was issued between 1946 and 1949 as part of the BSA's Explorer Scout Program. Although the Ranger program was officially discontinued in 1949, Explorer Scouts could continue work on the Ranger Award until 1951. A total of 2,782 Explorers earned the original Ranger Award between 1944 and 1951. The Ranger Award was re-introduced by the BSA in 1998 as part of the new Venturing program. Adam Snyder of Waukegan, Illinois was the first Venturer to earn the Ranger Award in 1999. For Leaders Scout Leaders interested in the Ranger award can take Powder Horn.

The festival only screens films that have not previously shown in or near Sacramento.  History  The Sacramento Film Festival started its life as the Sacramento Festival of Cinema, making it the oldest concurrently running all-genre film screening event in the Sacramento region. The Festival of Cinema began in 1995 under the guidance of Founder and Director Kenneth Segura Knoll. In 1998 Mr. Knoll transferred management of the event to Access Sacramento,Access Sacramento : Top Level : Welcome a Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable tv station which had been a supporting partner to the festival since its beginning. Access Sacramento's Executive Director, Ron Cooper, assigned Managing Director duties to his outreach coordinator, Martin Anaya.

Griffith entered the Marines in 1929 after graduating from the United States Naval Academy. He served in and commanded Marine units in the Pacific theater of World War II and retired from service in 1956. After his retirement, Griffith wrote several books and numerous articles on military history and lectured widely. He died on March 27, 1983, in Rhode Island. Early life through World War II Griffith was born May 31, 1906, in Lewistown, Pennsylvania. Upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy with a B.S. in electrical engineering in 1929, he accepted a commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. Prior to World War II, he took part in the Second Nicaraguan Campaign, and served in China, Cuba, and England. From 1935 to 1938, he studied the Chinese language while attached to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where he mastered Chinese. During World War II, following a period observing British commando training in England and Scotland, he returned to the 1st Marine Division and served as executive officer and later commander of the 1st Marine Raiders Battalion on Guadalcanal, and executive officer of the 1st Raider Regiment in operations on New Georgia. He received the Navy Cross on Guadalcanal in September 1942 for \\"extreme heroism and courageous devotion to duty\\" during the fighting near the Matanikau River. During this action, Griffith suffered wounds for which he was awarded the Purple Heart. For his exploits in July in New Georgia, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.History Division, USMC Navy Cross citation Citation: > The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting > the Navy Cross to Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Blair Griffith, II (MCSN: > 0-4436), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism and > distinguished service while leading the FIRST Marine Raider Battalion > against enemy Japanese forces in the vicinity of Matanikau, Guadalcanal, > Solomon Islands, on 27 September 1942.

Post-war career From 1946 to 1947, he held staff positions in Qingdao, China, giving him a front-row seat to observe the escalating Chinese Civil War. After participating in the post-World War II occupation of North China, where he commanded the 3rd Marine Regiment and later the U.S. Marine Forces in Qingdao, he was a student and then a faculty member at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport from 1947 to 1950. From 1951 to 1952, he was chief of staff, Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic, and from 1953 to 1956, General Griffith was on the staff of the U.S. Commander in Chief, Europe. He retired from the Marine Corps in 1956, after completing more than 25 years of active service. Post-retirement career Following his retirement, General Griffith entered Oxford University (New College) and was awarded his D.Phil. in Chinese Military History in 1961. With an interest in China and the Chinese language dating back to pre-World War II days, he translated Mao Zedong's On Guerrilla War in 1961 and Sun Tzu's The Art of War in 1963. The latter is much more than a mere translation. It incorporates numerous ancient Chinese commentaries on \\"The Art of War,\\" and also culls a variety of ancient sources for the chapters on Sun Tzu's biography, the evolution of the text, the Warring States period, ancient warfare, and a comparison with Mao Zedong's military thought. The word choice is perhaps evocative of both the hard work of translation and of the author's experiences at Guadalcanal and New Georgia. Other translators of Sun Tzu lack the insights derived from Griffith's long military experience. Griffith also wrote the definitive The Battle for Guadalcanal, The Chinese People's Liberation Army, and, his last major work, In Defense of the Public Liberty, a book concerned with the Revolutionary War. He was a research fellow, China Study, at the Council on Foreign Relations and a member of the Institute for Defense Studies in London. General Griffith published widely in such journals as The New Yorker, Saturday Evening Post, U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings, Town & Country, Marine Corps Gazette, and Foreign Affairs. He has also lectured widely at such establishments as the Armed Forces Staff College, United States Military Academy, Foreign Policy Association, and Marine Corps Schools. General Griffith was a life member of the 1st Marine Raider Association and the 1st Marine Division Association. He died unexpectedly on March 27, 1983, in Newport, Rhode Island.

Completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1989, it is meant to prevent sediment from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens from increasing flood risks along the Toutle and Cowlitz rivers. The Corps initially expected the basin behind the dam to be filled by 2035 with 258 million cubic yards (197 million m3) of sediment. However, additional debris flows from Mount St. Helens plus sediment from storm-related riverbank failures quickly filled the basin. It was nearly full by 2012, and large amounts of sediment overflowed the SRS and continued downstream. In July 2012, the Corps awarded a $4.5 million contract to LKE Corporation of Washougal, to raise the spillway by . In 2013, the contractor raised the dam's spillway by to increase the ability of the SRS to trap sediment.http://tdn.com/news/local/cowlitz-river-deepens-slightly-for-first- time-since-mount-st/article_400a5b8c-bdd0-11e3-b2c9-001a4bcf887a.html The higher spillway reduces the slope of the sediment plain behind the dam, thus allowing more debris to accumulate on top of existing debris. The Corps estimated that the higher spillway would maintain the trapping efficiency of the SRS at or above 31 percent--the fraction being trapped without the higher spillway--for 5 to 10 years after completion of the project. The SRS is about upstream from the confluence of the North Fork Toutle River with the Toutle River and from the larger river's mouth on the Cowlitz River.

These unofficial symbols of Vermont include maple syrup; the eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), which was worn as a badge by the Green Mountain Boys and appears on the Vermont coat of arms and Vermont Military Crest; and the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) also appearing on the state's coat of arms. The number 14 figures prominentally in the state's history and lore. The Vermont Republic lasted for fourteen years, the pine tree on the Great Seal of Vermont has fourteen branches, the state has fourteen counties, and Vermont was the fourteenth state in the Union. Vermont's state song is \\"These Green Mountains\\", composed by Diane Martin and arranged by Rita Buglass Gluck. This song was officially designated as the state song on 22 May 2000. This song replaced \\"Hail to Vermont!\\", which was written by Josephine Hovey-Perry and made the state song in 1938. However, \\"Moonlight in Vermont\\" remains an unofficial favorite. The state bird is the hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus). This was adopted in 1941. The bird was only designated after debate in the legislature; though the hermit thrush is found in all of 14 counties and has a distinctive sweet call, it leaves the state during the winter for its yearly southward migration. Many legislators favored the blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata). The red clover (Trifolium pratense) was designated as the state flower in 1895. The red clover is often seen in the countryside of Vermont hosting the state insect ‚Äì the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), designated by Act 124 of the 1978 biennial session of the Vermont General Assembly. A natural companion and frequent visitor to the state flower, the honey bee was chosen for its agricultural benefits, and for being a \\"social\\" insect and representing the unity side of Vermont's state motto Freedom and Unity. Vermont named two official state fish by Joint Resolution of the Vermont General Assembly in 1978 and statute in 2011: the cold-water fish, the brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and the warm-water fish, the walleye (Sander vitreous vitreous). The state tree is the sugar maple (Acer saccharum), effective in 1949. The sugar maple is the source of maple syrup, Vermont's most famous export. The Morgan horse became the state mammal in 1961. The Morgan horse is a horse breed originally from Vermont, and named for Justin Morgan. The state maintains standards and develops bloodlines for the breed at the University of Vermont's Morgan Horse Farm at Weybridge. The state amphibian, adopted by the legislature in 1997, is the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens). Vermont has also designated an official state mineral (talc), pie (apple pie), soil (\\"Tunbridge Soil Series\\"), beverage (milk), gem (grossular garnet), and fossil (the beluga skeleton at the University of Vermont's Perkins Geology Museum). The state reptile is the painted turtle. The state rocks are granite, marble, and slate. Vermont is distinct for being among only three U.S. states with both a state seal and a coat of arms. Vermont is the only U.S. state to have a heraldically correct blazon describing its coat of arms.

The chorus was first named ALSOUNDS, due in part to its affiliation with the ALSO Foundation. In April 1994, the name was changed to Melbourne Gay and Lesbian Chorus, reflecting the chorus's organisational independence and a desire to further challenge stereotypes. Background=Gay Choirs in Australia The first gay choir in Australia was the Gay Liberation Quire, an all-male, Sydney-based chorus. It began in 1981, and disbanded c. 1987.; see also McGuire, unaware of the Sydney group, learned for the first time of the existence of gay choruses while listening to an LP record, The San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus Tours America 1981, at a party. Inspired by the discovery, McGuire, along with his roommates (including his sister, Kathleen McGuire, and gay fiend Tuck Wah Leong),In later years, Kathleen McGuire, became the Artistic Director and Conductor of the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus (2000), and Tuck Wah Leong served as MGLC's gay pianist and then Music Director. discussed the notion of forming a gay and lesbian choir in Melbourne. McGuire wanted to form a choir specifically with gay men and women in an effort to unify these sometimes divergent groups. AIDS had already caused much devastation in the gay community, and he believed that a choir would help to lift spirits and be a positive expression against homophobia.According to Lawrence McGuire and Tuck Wah Leong in interviews with the present author. With a small group of men and women, both gay and straight, the first rehearsal was held on 28 April 1990 at St Luke's Anglican Church in South Melbourne. Sydney Gay and Lesbian Choir (SGLC) began less than a year later in January 1991, independent of the Melbourne chorus. Rob Holland founded SGLC in response to the lack of Australian representation in the Cultural Festival of the Vancouver Gay Games, held in August 1990. Since then, many choirs with an LGBT focus have formed in Australia and also in New Zealand: =Chronology of Gay Choirs in Australia and New Zealand= * Gay Liberation Quire (men's), Sydney (1981-1987) * Melbourne Gay & Lesbian Chorus, founded 1990 * Sydney Gay and Lesbian Choir, founded 1991 * Gay & Lesbian Singers (GALS) Auckland, founded 1992 * Canberra Gay and Lesbian Qwire, founded 1993 * Gay and Lesbian Singers of Western Australia (GALSWA), founded 1993 * Adelaide Gay & Lesbian Singers (1996 - 1999) * Brisbane Lesbian and Gay Pride Choir, founded 1998 * Adelaide Gay & Lesbian Qwire, founded 2001 * shOUT Youth Chorus (formerly Melbourne Gay & Lesbian Youth Chorus), founded 2005 * Cairns Out Loud Lesbian & Gay Choir, founded 2007 * Homophones, gay men's chorus in Wellington (2007-2011) * LOW REZ Melbourne Male Choir, founded 2008 * Glamaphones (mixed chorus), Wellington, founded 2011 * The Decibelles Female Pop Choir Inc,Melbourne, founded 2012 * QTas - Tasmania's LGBTIQ Choir, founded 2013 Conductors MGLC's first Musical Director was Trevor Dunn. Dunn, who was a music teacher at Kilbreda College - a Catholic girls' high school in Mentone, directed the group for a number of years before succumbing to AIDS in 1992. Following a series of short-term conductors, Tuck Wah Leong took the helm as Musical Director c. 1994 and directed the MGLC's first, award-winning CD and its first international tour.Artist bio In 2001, MGLC appointed conductor Adrian Kirk, under whose direction the chorus developed a more sophisticated, classical sound. Jonathon Welch AM - of the renowned operatic trio: Tenor Australis, and former conductor of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Choir - served as MGLC's Musical Director from 2005 to 2007. Darren Wicks was Musical Director for 2008. In 2009, Adrian Schultz, the director of the Youth Chorus, was appointed Musical Director and served until July, 2013. Subsequently, he served as guest conductor of the Youth Chorus for the Christmas concert in 2014 and on multiple occasions since. Ben Leske was appointed Musical Director of the Melbourne Gay and Lesbian Youth Chorus (now known as shOUT)http://mglc.org.au/youth-chorus in 2009 and led the Youth Chorus until early 2015, for its first major performance, The Sound of Youth (2010), and during a period of significant growth in its membership. In November 2017, Ben graduated with a PhD in Music Therapy from the University of Melbourne. The focus of the PhD was choir leadership, inspired by his interest in the wellbeing of members of the Melbourne Gay and Lesbian Youth Chorus.https://precinct.finearts-music.unimelb.edu.au/2018/03/08/let-it-go- remembering-dr-ben-leske/ Dr Kathleen McGuire served as interim Musical Director in 2009 and then served as Musical Director 2013‚Äì2015. She also conducted MGLC at Trevor Dunn's memorial service in 1992 and at several annual AIDS memorial services at St Mark's Anglican Church in the early 1990s. Drew Downing was appointed as Musical Director in 2015. Community involvement Since its inception, the MGLC has provided support and outreach to the GLBTI community. Examples of regular community appearances include: annual Stonewall commemorative service for the Metropolitan Community Church; World AIDS Day ceremonies and services for the People Living With AIDS; Australia Day Picnic for GLBTI radio station, JOY Melbourne 94.9 FM. Youth Chorus In August 2005, MGLC founded the Melbourne Gay and Lesbian Youth Chorus, the first chorus of its kind in Australasia. The inaugural Youth Chorus Musical Director was Gudula Kinzler. Gudula, a German citizen, was in Australia for a few years, and has now returned to Germany where she is the Musical Director of Die Rheintochter, a mixed women's choir, based in Cologne, Germany. They perform their own major stand-alone performances, and also join with the main chorus at numerous events. They recorded their first CD, \\"Count Me In\\", in 2008. In November 2015, MGLYC formally changed their name to shOUT Youth Chorus. The members felt that it was important to re-brand in such a way that recognises the Youth Chorus's inclusion of people of diverse genders and sexualities. shOUT welcomes young people of all types and celebrates that diversity.

It takes place in the Crossworld, a new reality formed from the collapse of several formerly separate worlds that became unhinged in the space/time continuum. The game was developed by Seven Lights and launched on June 25, 2008. It has been discontinued as of 2011.  Gameplay  Screenshot of The Continuum One starts by signing up, and receiving free units to build a squad that a player will use to battle other players and find usable equipment on the battlefield. A player can also purchase units with real money, whether in starter packs of 40, booster packs of 15, or individually. The developers have indicated that everyone may play for free, receiving one free booster pack upon registration. Once a player have purchased their units, they may begin spending their \\"ability points\\" to improve the units. Common units have one ability point to spend, Uncommon units have two, Rare units begin with three and Heroic units have four. As a player spend these ability points, they can choose what abilities theirr units will have in combat. A player's choices is important, though they gain additional ability points as their units level up, depending on their rarity. Next, a player must form their units into squads within an army. This is easily accomplished by either a simple click of a button or dragging the units into the squad header. Once an army is built, players can discuss the game in the lobby until a player find someone to challenge or is challenged by someone. After challenging or being challenged by an opponent, a player will choose the point value and map for their battle. Having chosen those aspects and the army that a player will use to battle, they then may explore the various sites for equipment before entering combat against their opponent. Once their squad makes contact with another squad, a player enters a combat screen. Here a player get to make use of those abilities that they purchased in the set-up stage. The battle selection screen is very customizable to prevent abuse of new players by more experience characters. A player's individual units make use of their skills, they have a squad tactic the player choose (default is attack) based on this tactic, they may or may not gain an advantage to their actions in that round of combat. After three such rounds of combat, a player return to the map screen and may move about again. The winner (based on the criteria chosen at the beginning of the scenario) is given a larger chunk of experience points to each of their characters. While the defeated player is given less, so that even in losing, a player's characters still gain experience and may level up, just not as fast. After the scenario is finished, a player can return to their army screen, outfit their units with equipment they found during the battle, spend ability points gained from leveling, and change the composition of their armies and squads. Primarily involving turn-based squad combat, the game allows players to improve the individual units in their squadron with power-ups, abilities and equipment. Players will be able to find new equipment scattered throughout the game world, and will be rewarded for accomplishing various objectives. In addition to random finds and trading, players can improve their armies through the purchase of expansion packs, similar to those in collectible card games.RPG Vault: RPG Vault Soapbox - Digital Item Sales The game is designed in a browser-based format using Adobe Flash. The developers have said the format will allow them to add and change content very quickly in response to the community.Video Game Features, PC Game Features  Synopsis  The Continuum universe is developed through three issues of a comic book in addition to the game itself. The comics,The Continuum Comics written by the Seven Lights developers, originate various plot lines that will presumably be critical to the game. A fourth issue is in the works for the launch sometime in mid-2009. The first issue discusses a war between two shape shifting races, the wolf- like Kherr and the bird-like Talon, and then presents a new cat-like enemy that the two races must come together to defend against. Issue two introduces a vampire hunter and the trials he faces in his task. The two story lines begin to merge at the end of the second issue. The Third issue follows the story of a race of elemental wielding humans known as manifests. It also introduces the first hint of player-to-story interaction, as it is popular belief that the final page in the comic shows a location from the role-playing forum. Continuum developers have said player actions in the game world will influence the direction of the story line. In addition, they currently plan to expand the story's narrative through additional comics, novels, and digital videos.Video Game Features, PC Game Features  Realities and Races  The Disruption was a cataclysmic event which caused four separate realities to collide and merge. From these original worlds came a variety of races and species, each with their own unique powers and abilities. They were thrown together in this new place, a world which became known as The Crossworld. = Shapeshifters = A world where all beings can shift from human form to that of a beast. Eternal beings from this world have chosen to stay in their bestial form. These Eternals sometimes form a union or bond with one of their shapeshifting brethren. The Bonded unit and their Eternal partner can utilize devastating coordinated attacks against their unlucky opponents. Kherr: The Kherr are a fiercely loyal race of beings that can shapeshift between wolf and human form. Living in harmony with the land, the Kherr use their ability to adapt and conceal themselves within their terrain. Kherr are cunning melee warriors, trained from birth in the arts of guerrilla warfare and vicious hand-to-hand combat. Talon: The Talon are an agile race of beings that can shapeshift between great eagle and human form. With their superior vision and view from above, the Talon can inflict crippling ranged attacks with little risk of taking damage themselves. Talon are adept at civic rule and have great skills at fostering commerce between groups, usually to their own benefit. Ursa: The Ursa are a race of huge beings that can shapeshift between bear and human form. Ursa are intelligent, artistic, methodical and slow to anger, however when family or kin are threatened, the Ursa become the most aggressive of all races, employing an arsenal of punishing melee attacks. Ferran: The Ferran are a ferocious race of beings that can shapeshift between great cats and human form. The Ferran are dim, impulsive brutes who bite and slash their way to getting what they want. Ferran are not known for their great strength or strategic prowess, but they make up for it with speed, razor sharp teeth, and long claws. Ferran are nomadic by nature and typically overwhelm foes with superior numbers and lightning-quick surprise attacks. Ancients: Ancients are a noble race of beings that can shapeshift between dragons and human form. The Ancients hadn't been seen in over a century prior to the Disruption and were thought to be extinct. They had retreated as a race to the highest of mountains- higher than the strongest Talon could reach- to escape the constant conflict and erosion of civility between the other shapeshifting races. = Vampire = A world overrun by voracious vampires that forged together a dwindling resistance of mystical elves and hardened humans who were making their last stand against the vampires at the time of the Disruption. Vampire: No longer human, these blood-thirsty leeches overtook their entire reality before being brought to The Crossworld. Elf: Tall and lithe, elves of the Vampire reality revere the sun and harness the light it brings through their magicks. Human: The most adaptable of all races. Humans are the most proficient race at utilizing social bonds for survival. More than any other race, humans can develop and specialize in many different ways, but have very few natural resistances to attacks. Unclean: Rather than face death or being turned by the Vampires, the cowardly Unclean tainted themselves with dead Vampire Blood thereby making themselves unappealing to the Leeches but less than human. = Manifested = A world where all people manifest a distinct power (fire, ice, etc..) at some point in their lives. The later in life the power is manifested, the greater the power. Fire: The Fire race of beings from the Manifested world can create and use fire in offensive and defensive attacks. Fire beings are known for their ambition and will use force as a means to achieving their goals. Once their goals are achieved, the people of Fire typically maintain peace through laws and structure instead of bloodshed. Earth: The Earth race of beings from the Manifested world can use and manipulate the earth and terrain in offensive and defensive attacks. Mercurial and possessing great strength, the Earth race are a simple folk who often are ruled by their hearts instead of their intellect. Water: The Water race of beings from the Manifested world can create and use water in offensive and defensive attacks. Water beings are typically even-keeled and calculating. They are not known for outright aggression, and prefer to stay as neutral as possible. However, if engaged, the water race will not hesitate to return aggression with decisive force. Air: The Air race of beings from the Manifested world can use and manipulate the heavens in offensive and defensive attacks. The race of Air beings is generally a mischievous lot who enjoy wielding their power for their own amusement. They tend to be aloof and unconcerned with things that occur in the sea or on the land. Although they lack physical strength, air beings can inflict heavy damage with precise ranged attacks from great distances. Gypsy: A disdained segment of society in the Manifested reality with strange and mysterious powers. = The Legion = A world that has been dominated by one militaristic society. From the lowliest Legion Squire to the most battle-tested Order Captain‚Äîall Legion units can be counted on for fierce discipline and precise execution. Human: The most adaptable of all races. Humans are the most proficient race at utilizing social bonds for survival. More than any other race, humans can develop and specialize in many different ways, but have very few natural resistances to attacks. Manoan: The Manoans are a peaceful, island people who possess great size and physical agility. Although docile as a race, Manoans engage in a brutal, physically demanding sport known as Quaila. Quaila matches are fiercely competitive with a loss resulting in the defeated team cutting their hair in shame. Ravager: Once thought to be extinct, ravagers are a race of beings that was created through alchemical experiments gone horribly wrong. Huge, fast and vicious, Ravagers are almost unbeatable in melee combat. These feral beasts have sharp metal shards fused to their bodies that act as both armor and weapon. Brynstan: For years, the Brynstans were simply a myth‚Äîsomething to scare children. Their proliferation went beyond their ability to remain clandestine, and eventually their dark alchemy led to the blighting of the Legion reality.

The name arose from the turret's spherical housing. It was a manned turret, as distinct from remote- controlled turrets also in use. The turret held the gunner, two heavy machine guns, ammunition, and sights. The Sperry Corporation designed ventral versions that became the most common version; thus, the term \\"ball turret\\" generally indicates these versions.  Sperry ball turret  Interior of the Sperry ball turret of a preserved B-17 (2008) Sperry and Emerson Electric each developed a ball turret, and the designs were similar in the nose turret version. Development of the spherical Emerson was halted. The Sperry nose turret was tested and preferred, but its use was limited due to poor availability of suitable aircraft designs. The Sperry-designed ventral system saw widespread use and production, including much sub-contracting. The design was mainly deployed on the B-17 Flying Fortress and the B-24 Liberator, as well as the United States Navy's Liberator, the PB4Y-1. The ventral turret was used in tandem in the Convair B-32, successor to the B-24. Ball turrets appeared in the nose and tail as well as the nose of the final series B-24. The Sperry ball turret was very small in order to reduce drag, and was typically operated by the smallest man of the crew. To enter the turret, the turret was moved until the guns were pointed straight down. The gunner placed his feet in the heel rests and occupied his cramped station. He would put on a safety strap and close and lock the turret door. There was no room inside for a parachute, which was left in the cabin above the turret. A few gunners wore a chest parachute. The gunner was forced to assume a fetal position within the turret with his back and head against the rear wall, his hips at the bottom, and his legs held in mid-air by two footrests on the front wall. This left him positioned with his eyes roughly level with the pair of light-barrel Browning AN/M2 .50 caliber machine guns which extended through the entire turret, located to either side of the gunner. The cocking handles were located too close to the gunner to be operated easily, so a cable was attached to the handle through pulleys to a handle near the front of the turret. Another factor was that not all stoppages could be corrected by charging (cocking) the guns. In many cases, when a stoppage occurred, it was necessary for the gunner to \\"reload\\" the gun, which required access to the firing chamber of the guns. Access was severely restricted by the guns' location in the small turret. Normally, the gunner accessed the firing chamber by releasing a latch and raising the cover to a position perpendicular to the gun but this was not possible in the ball turret. To remedy that, the front end of the cover was \\"slotted\\". The gunner released the latch and removed the cover which allowed space to clear the action. Small ammunition boxes rested on the top of the turret and additional ammunition belts fed the turret by means of a chute system. A reflector sight was hung from the top of the turret, positioned roughly between the gunner's feet. A B-24J's Sperry ventral ball turret in its retracted position for landing, as seen from inside the bomber In the case of the B-24, the Liberator's tricycle landing gear design mandated that its A-13 model Sperry ball turret have a fully retractable mount, so that the ball turret would always be retracted upwards into the lower fuselage while the aircraft was on the ground, providing ground clearance with it in the stowed position. The conventional landing gear of the B-17 meant that the ball turret did not need to be retracted for clearance on the ground, but if the plane was required to do a belly landing (such as in the case of landing gear system failure), the ball turret would likely be destroyed due to the lack of clearance, meaning anyone occupying the turret would be in a precarious position if unable to escape.  ERCO ball turret  An Erco ball turret Erco Ball turret, on display at National Museum of Naval Aviation, Florida After testing in mid-1943, the ERCO ball turret became the preferred bow installation in the Navy's Consolidated PB4Y-1 Liberator and PB4Y-2 Privateer patrol bombers although other types continued to be installed. Earlier designs appeared in other patrol seaplanes. It served a double purpose, defense against bow attacks as well as fire suppression and offensive strafing in antisubmarine warfare. Since this turret is of the ball type, the gunner moves with his guns and sight in elevation and azimuth by means of control handles. Among the earlier designs was the Martin 250SH bow turret of the PBM-3 twin- engined patrol flying boat which had many points of similarity in design and action.

It was premiered in Moscow on , with Sergei Taneyev as soloist and Max Erdmannsd√∂rfer conducting. The Concert Fantasia received many performances in the first 20 years of its existence. It then disappeared from the repertoire and lay virtually unperformed for many years, but underwent a revival in the latter part of the 20th century. Structure This work is written in two movements and lasts approximately 30 minutes. # Quasi rondo: Andante mosso #: The quasi part of the title for this movement describes a formal layout in which musical material for a rondo appears only once then returns at the end, after a single episode. The playful character of the two themes presented may have justified in the composer's mind an affinity with the sparkling character classical rondo finales. Other than this, there is nothing connecting them with usual rondo practice. Nevertheless, Tchaikovsky succeeds in developing his ideas originally within the demands of piano virtuosity and orchestral accompaniment.Warrack, 48 # Contrastes #: Like the opening movement, this one poses a formal problem, albeit an uncommon one,Blom, 62 then solves it simply and well. Beginning as a cadenza for piano solo, the movement contrasts a slow, melodic opening theme (quickly counterpointed by a solo cello) and a quicker, dance-like second theme alternate, contrast and compete against one another, with very lively results, leading into the final section without a break. These very extensive sections take the place of slow movement and finale for a conventional concerto.Brown, 280-281 Tempo indications are Andante Cantabile - Molto Vivace - Vivacissimo - Allegro Moderato - Vivacissimo - Molto Piu Tranquillo - Vivace. Tchaikovsky had voiced his dislike for the sound of piano and orchestra while writing his Second Piano ConcertoSteinberg, 483 with his isolating the soloist from the orchestra as much as possible. Tchaikovsky scholar David Brown notes that the middle section of the quasi Rondo of the Fantasia, written for piano solo, \\"was the logical goal toward which this precedent had pointed\\".Brown, 278-279 This gives the section the appearance of a cadenza while actually being based on new material. This cadenza substitutes for the development section in sonata form.Brown, 279 Instrumentation The Fantasia is scored for piano solo plus the following: Woodwinds : 3 flutes : 2 oboes : 2 clarinets in A : 2 bassoons Brass : 4 horns in F : 2 trumpets in D : 3 trombones Percussion : Timpani : Glockenspiel : Tambourine Strings : Violins : Violas : Cellos : Double basses Overview=Two works, one source Tchaikovsky returned from abroad at the beginning of March 1884, determined to spend the spring months with his sister at Kamenka. This trip was delayed by urgent modifications to his opera Mazeppa. Tchaikovsky wrote to Nadezhda von Meck from St. Petersburg on 13 March 1884, \\"I am feeling a surge of energy, and an impatience to set about something new \\" But Tchaikovsky did not manage to start any new work in Saint Petersburg. Only after arriving at Kamenka on 12 April did Tchaikovsky set to work. Tchaikovsky was uncertain initially what type of composition he would write. Captivated by the playing of the famed Liszt pupil Eugen d'Albert, who had given concerts in Moscow during the 1883/84 season, his thoughts turned to a new piano concerto. Nonetheless, he wrote in his diary for 13 April 1884, \\"I stopped playing around and came up with something new. Hit upon an idea for a concerto for piano, but it still sounded too poor and unoriginal\\". Progress, at least in the composer's view, did not improve over time. On 17 and 18 April, Tchaikovsky wandered in the Trostianka woods and noted down, in his own words: \\"wretched ideas.\\" In June, after completing the sketches and piano arrangement of what would become the Third Orchestral Suite while staying at Grankino, Tchaikovsky returned to composing the Concert Fantasia. He now included Contrastes, the rejected first movement of the suite, as the second movement of the Fantasia. This was surprising considering the amount of grief its writing had caused him when he originally conceived it for the Third Suite.Brown, 262 Though Tchaikovsky apparently could not keep his hands off this music, he still harboured doubts about it. At the end of the Quasi rondo opening movement, he added an optional coda for the soloist which was both technically showy and rhetorically empty. This alternative cadenza was to be used in case Contrastes was omitted in performance. First performance During October and November the Concert Fantasia was rapidly engraved, since it had to be ready for a concert of the Russian Musical Society in December, where Taneyev would premiere it. This performance, scheduled for 15 December 1884, was delayed owing to the indisposition of the conductor, Max Erdmannsd√∂rfer. The concert took place on 22 February 1885 at the tenth symphony concert of the Russian Musical Society in Moscow. Taneyev was soloist, with Erdmannsd√∂rfer conducting. Tchaikovsky, who attended the concert, wrote to Modest on 25 February, \\"I heard a superb performance of the Fantasia by Taneyev and the orchestra, with which I was delighted. It had great success with the public.\\" In St. Petersburg, the Concert Fantasia was performed for the first time on 4 April 1886 in the tenth symphony concert of the Russian Musical Society, conducted by Hans von B√ºlow and with Taneyev as soloist. The Concert Fantasia was published by P. Jurgenson. Arrangements for four pianos and two hands were brought out in December 1884, the orchestral parts in January 1885, and the full score in March 1893. The arrangement of the Fantasia was printed with a dedication to Anna Yesipova, and the full score to Sophie Menter. Analysis=Quasi Rondo The first movement of the fantasia, Quasi Rondo, is purely decorative in form and moderately eloquent and emotional in content. This movement is not a true rondo. It tries to approximate rondo form by beginning and ending with an extensive section which could be called a principal rondo subject. However, these two statements also have a second theme. The first time this theme appears, it is in the key of the dominant; the second time, it appears in the tonic. This order of appearance is more like the two subjects in a regular sonata movement.Blom, 61 While Quasi sonata might have proved a more fitting title, what actually matters here is that the music is a manner of charm, elegant craftsmanship and a high entertainment value. The main theme is developed playfully, almost in the vein of a fairy-tale ballet. The solo part is written into the music so that it uses virtuosity for musical purposes without conspicuous display. With the second theme, it is the piano and not the orchestra that carries and develops it. The middle section, which begins with a long, elaborate solo passage, is episodic. It employs two new melodic ideas, expansive in themselves and even more luxuriantly developed. The orchestra stays silent during this long interlude. When it enters for the recapitulation, the music proceeds much as it did before, except for a new transition so the second subject can remain in the tonic and allow the movement to close on the tonic. Contrastes Contrastes is both an attractive and characteristic piece ‚Äî so much so that it is hard for some critics to believe Tchaikovsky did not like this piece and offered an alternative to it. Two main themes predominate, one fast, the other slow. They are shown as contrasts not just one by one in the order of sonata first and second subjects, but often simultaneously and in varying ways. The piece could be considered a classic solution in thematic telescoping. The only qualm is that the quick theme can seem to lack spontaneity, as though it had been over-engineered for its role in this movement.Blom, 62-3 One important note is that the counterpoint for solo cello added to the slow tune being played by the piano is not the contrasting idea to which the title of the piece refers. It is merely an episode, Neither is the quiet melody that follows over an accompaniment embodying one of those inner pedal points which are a characteristic trick of Tchaikovsky's musical style. (The trick being mentioned is that of two alternating notes which go on for some time while the corresponding harmony changes. This happens in the finale of the Fifth Symphony.)Blom, 63 The first hint that something in a new, quick rhythm is going to be contrasted with the slow theme is when the soloist plays rapid ascending scales to its restatement by the oboe. These develop into quicker arpeggios. Follow these is a cleverly contrived transition where the arpeggios act as though mutual friends, introducing the two different rhythmic elements to each other in a passage where these patterns not meet but overlap. Why neglect? Tchaikovsky biographer and music writer David Brown has commented, \\"[The Concert Fantasia's] crippling weakness is that it contains not one really strong idea, yet its very original structure suffices to show that Tchaikovsky was concerned to fashion something more than a mere showpiece to gratify a virtuoso pianist or inflame a lionizing audience\\".Brown, 278 He adds, \\"For all its melodic shortcomings, the Concert Fantasia has some engaging qualities and a structural freshness which should win it the occasional hearing\\".Brown, 281 Recordings One of its earliest modern-day champions was Noel Mewton-Wood, who recorded it in 1951, with an orchestra conducted by Walter Goehr.

The soul food eatery is a popular gathering place for Harlem residents and tourists not far from the Apollo Theater. Life Sylvia's Restaurant Sylvia was born to Julia and Van Pressley in Hemingway, South Carolina. Her father, Van Pressley, died when she was just three days old from complications of injuries he received during combat in World War I. By April 10, 1930, she had lived in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, with her grandmother Sylvia Johnson, the woman she was named after. Johnson had worked as a farmer, a trade that Pressley would get into when she got a little older. In 1930, Sylvia's mother took the rest of her family to New York so she could better provide for her family, leaving her grandmother, Sylvia Johnson to raise three-year-old Sylvia. Woods met her future husband, Herbert, in a bean field when she was 11 years old and he was 12. They married in 1944 after he followed her to New York.Sylvia Woods, Soul- Food Restaurateur, Is Dead at 86, by Margalit Fox. New York Times, July 19, 2012. Retrieved July 24, 2012 They had four children together: Van, Bedelia, Kenneth, and Crizette. Woods graduated from high school in her hometown of Hemingway, South Carolina. She trained to become a beautician in New York, and also ran a beauty shop in South Carolina. Woods also worked in a hat factory, and as a waitress at a restaurant called Johnson‚Äôs Luncheonette in Harlem from 1954 to 1962. Woods worked at Johnson's for about seven or eight years. When the owner wanted to sell, he offered the place to Woods for $20,000. During the early 1990s, the business expanded and now seats up to 450 people. It also has a catering business. Organized and started by her son Van in 1992, Sylvia came out with her own line of soul food products that are sold nationally. Woods' products include many of her special sauces, vegetables, spices, syrup, and cornbread and pancake mixes. Woods produced two cookbooks: Sylvia‚Äôs Soul Food Cookbook, published in 1992; and Sylvia‚Äôs Family Soul Food Cookbook, published in 1999, both by William Morrow and Company. The restaurant remains owned and operated by the Woods family. In August 2011, they celebrated 50 years in Harlem. Guests have included Quincy Jones, Diana Ross, Muhammad Ali, Bill Clinton, Robert F. Kennedy, and President Barack Obama. Sylvia Woods stepped down from the day-to-day operations of the restaurant when she was 80 years old. Sylvia's is currently owned and operated by her children and grandchildren. Her husband Herbert predeceased her, dying in 2001. Woods died on July 19, 2012, at her home in Mount Vernon, New York, at the age of 86. She had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for several years. In 2014, the corner of W.126th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem was co-named \\"Sylvia P. Woods Way.\\" Awards and recognition Due to the immense popularity of her soul- food staples, Woods was known as \\"the Queen of Soul Food.\\" Spike Lee used Sylvia's restaurant as a location for his 1991 film, Jungle Fever. New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was due to present Woods with an award at a celebration of the 50th anniversary of Sylvia‚Äôs Restaurant shortly after she died; a family friend accepted it on her behalf.

It is known as the first Italian science fiction film, predating even the science fiction films of Antonio Margheriti. Plot From Cape Shark in the Australian desert, the United Nations launches an atomic rocket on a manned moon mission, but one of the engines malfunctions. The pilot, American John MacLaren, disengages the capsule and returns to Earth. The atomic booster, however, continues on, eventually exploding in the Delta asteroid cluster. When MacLaren insists on staying at Cape Shark to help, his homesick wife Mary takes their son and leaves for the U.S. without him. Engineer Peter Leduq, a boastful ladies' man, makes a bet that he can thaw frigid co-worker Katie Dandridge with a kiss within six days, unaware she can hear him over the intercom. She rebuffs his initial efforts but allows him to kiss her while they are working an all- nighter to calculate the results of the rocket's explosion. When she belatedly remembers his amorousness is motivated by a bet, she is heartbroken, not realizing he has developed genuine feelings for her. The rocket explosion dislodges the asteroids from their orbits. They coalesce into one giant cluster heading for Earth. To make matters worse, scientists find that the cluster will pass the Moon, causing tidal effects which will flood coastal regions. As the cluster approaches it causes worldwide disasters: tidal waves, wind, firestorms and earthquakes. Mass evacuations lead to panic and riots. While searching for a solution, Dandridge cracks under the pressure and Leduq takes over her shift for her, exposing his sensitive and supportive side to her. At the eleventh hour, MacLaren comes up with the idea of arming every missile on earth with a nuclear warhead and firing them all at the cluster. Due to the climate change wrought by the cluster, Cape Shark's air conditioning must remain at maximum power to keep the temperature low enough for the base's calculator to determine all the firing data. MacLaren is reunited with his family. Mary explains that they were waiting until the last minute to board the plane in hopes that he would join them, and so heard the announcement of the asteroid disaster and headed back to Cape Shark. Scientist Dr. Randowsky becomes convinced that the chaos caused by the cluster is divine punishment for mankind's use of nuclear missiles. He disables the air conditioning unit, thus rendering the calculator inoperative, and uses a gun to hold off anyone who approaches to restore it. MacLaren, Leduq, and MacLaren's friend Herbert Weisser rush Randowsky, and Weisser is fatally shot. Randowsky runs out of ammunition and, while fleeing from MacLaren and Leduq, accidentally electrocutes himself. The calculator is restarted, and the last of the firing data is transmitted. The missiles are launched, destroying the cluster and saving Earth. Cast *Paul Hubschmid as John MacLaren *Fiorella Mari as Mary MacLaren *Ivo Garrani as Herbert Weisser *Madeleine Fischer as Katie Dandridge *Dario Micha√´lis as Peter Leduq *Sam Galter as Dr. Randowsky *Jean-Jacques Delbo as Sergei Boetnikov Production=Background and pre- production Prior to the release of The Day the Sky Exploded, there had been no Italian science fiction films. Some earlier films such as Mario Mattoli's comedy 1,000 chilometri al minuto feature scientists involving space research, but the aspect had little relevance to the plot. Some earlier American science fiction films such as Invaders From Mars were only released in 1957 in Italy and received considerable financial success. Development on The Day the Sky Exploded began in early 1958. It is unknown whose idea it was to develop a science fiction. The credited director of the film is Paolo Heusch who had made his directorial the previous year with L'uomo facile which premiered in 1958. It is unclear what happened to Heusch, as Mario Bava biographer stated Herusch had not directed a film since Un colpo da mille miliardi in the 1960s. Among the cast was Paul Hubschmid who was an actors active since the 1930s and later acted in American films under the name Paul Christian. Giacomo Rossi- Stuart also featured in the film and was his first of several roles he would do for Mario Bava. Filming According to cast member Ivo Garrani, Mario bava was \\"completely directed by Bava. Really, Paulo Heusch didn't do very much on the set.\\" This was also collaborated by production assistant Armando Govoni who in an interview with stated Black Sunday was \\"not Bava's first film, he had already directed a picture for Paolo Heusch.\\" Bava was not only the cameraman, special effects designer on the film but also responsible for manipulating the newsreel footage to tell the films story. Lucas said that nearly 60% of the film consists of stock footage documenting dozens of unrelated events. Among the special effects Bava created for the film include a number of glass shots using clips from magazines, such as one in Moscow using a clip of a Minaret from National Geographic and the \\"Mt. Hula\\" telescope taken from Popular Science. To film the large sphere surrounded by a halo in the skies over the city, Bava projected slies of world land-marks onto a opaque silk screen with a brute light behind it. Lucas commented that the object appeared to be \\"a large sponge with chunks torn out\\". The shot was then overlaid with multiple exposures which Bava took with his father's Mitchell camera, wound the footage back and shot numerous additional exposures with backyard and home made rocket models. Music The film score was made by Carlo Rustichelli. Rustichelli reported directly to Bava while developing the score to the fim, with Rustichelli explaingint that \\"Generally it was the director who chose the composer, in agreement with the music publishers and sometimes with the producer or the screenwriter.\\" The film score was created using acoustic and electronic instruments and non-musical devices. The composer explained that he \\"went into the recording studio with a fire extinguisher, a blender and a vacuum cleaner, to do those special sound effects.\\" Rustichellie commented that \\"It was difficult to create a new sound for this particular genre; you must remember that this was very crude science fiction; it wasn't 2001 or a Star Wars.\\" Rustichelli would work with Bava again on The Whip and the Body and Blood and Black Lace. Release The Day the Sky Exploded was released in Italy on September 4, 1958. It grossed less than 150,000 Italian lire domestically. It was released in France as Le Danger vient de l'Esapce the following year by Lux Cinematographique on July 15, 1959. It premiered in the United States on September 27, 1961 in Los Angeles. The film was distributed by Excelsior Pictures in the United States, a small distributor that did not have any financial success with their few previous releases. The Day the Sky Exploded was released on VHS and Betamax in the United States by Sinister Cinema and on DVD by Alpha Video. Reception In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin stated that \\"The producers of this Franco-Italian science fiction film have turned to stock footage to such an extent that this might well be termed the stock-shot film par excellence.\\" and that \\"this disparate material has been quite ingeniously assembled\\". They concluded that the film was \\"otherwise routine\\" and \\"tamely directed\\". TV Guide gave the film a one out of four rating, referring to it as an \\"Ineffective sci-fi outing\\". In Phil Hardy's book Science Fiction (1984), a review stated that \\"the picture's main asset is Bava's excellent cinematography; both acting and direction fail to transcend a poor script.\\" See also * List of French films of 1958 * List of science fiction films of the 1950s * List of Italian films of 1958  Notes =References * * External links * Category:1950s science fiction films Category:1958 films Category:Films about astronauts Category:Films directed by Paolo Heusch Category:Films scored by Carlo Rustichelli Category:Italian films Category:French films Category:Italian-language films Category:Italian science fiction films Category:French science fiction films Category:Lux Film films ","title":"The Day the Sky Exploded"},{"id":"10133496","title":"2005 Alpine Skiing World Cup ‚Äì Women's Downhill"},{"id":"10133498","text":"Sphere3 (pronounced Sphere Cubed) are a progressive rock / jazz fusion band from the United Kingdom.

They are a form of osteitis fibrosa cystica. It is not a neoplasm, but rather simply a mass. It most commonly affects the maxilla and mandible, though any bone may be affected. Brown tumours are radiolucent on x-ray. Pathology Micrograph of a brown tumor (left of image). H&E; stain. Brown tumours consist of fibrous tissue, woven bone and supporting vasculature, but no matrix. The osteoclasts consume the trabecular bone that osteoblasts lay down and this front of reparative bone deposition followed by additional resorption can expand beyond the usual shape of the bone, involving the periosteum thus causing bone pain. The characteristic brown coloration results from hemosiderin deposition into the osteolytic cysts. Hemosiderin deposition is not a distinctive feature of brown tumors; it may also be seen in giant cell tumors of the bone. Brown tumors may be rarely associated with ectopic parathyroid adenomas or end stage renal osteodystrophy. Diagnosis Histologically, it is impossible to distinguish a Brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism from other giant cell lesions of bone. Rarely a focal collection of osteoclasts (brown tumor) may occur in relation to periosteum and be indistinguishable from a peripheral giant cell granuloma (giant cell epulis). The possibility of hyperparathyroidism should be considered in patients with recurrent or multiple giant cell epulides. ; Radiographically, brown tumor may show no detectable changes or a generalized osteoporosis. Partial loss of lamina dura around the teeth may occur but is not a constant feature. Focal Lesions (Brown Tumor) present as sharply defined, round or oval radiolucent areas which may appear multilocular. Such lesions occur more frequently in mandible than maxilla Treatment Treatment of hyperparathyroidism is required. Parathyroidectomy usually leads to spontaneous healing of Brown tumors in primary cases. Calcitriol (Rocaltrol) and cinacalcet (a calcimimetic) are used as pharmacologic treatments. Epidemiology Age and gender have an effect on the incidence of these lesions; they are more prevalent in women than men (though still common in both genders), and they appear more frequently with age. Due to the standard of medical care and screening in developed countries, it is increasingly rare for primary hyperparathyroidism to present with accompanying bone disease. This is not the case in less developed nations, however, and the two conditions are more often seen together.

Code data  * IATA Code: WG * ICAO Code: MAK * Callsign: Malin  History  The company was founded in June 1985 by Glasgow lawyer Frank Cannon. Scheduled operations were launched in early 1986 with a Glasgow to Donegal service using 9 passenger Britten Norman Islander aircraft. A planned expansion saw the recruitment of a number of ex Air Ecosse staff, including Malinair's General Manager and Operations Manager. In the summer of 1986, Malinair began operating the former Air Ecosse Aberdeen-Glasgow-Belfast service with a leased Dornier 228 from Schreiner Airways (PH-SDO, re- registered G-MLDO cn8009) using Ecosse's route licence and WG flight code. By the following year the company had 3 BN2 Islanders (G-MALI, G-MALN, G-MALB) and 2 further Do.228s (G-MLNR cn8108 & G-CFIN cn8096) operating a mix of daytime schedule/charter and night mail flights. 1987 heralded an expansion of service from Donegal with the launch of flights to Manchester using a Do.228, whilst another Dornier operated Glasgow-Teesside-Gatwick. For a short time a BN2 Islander operated a Glasgow to Humberside service. Night mail flights were operated from Belfast, Glasgow and Aberdeen, primarily for Datapost. Despite ambitious plans including a ¬£15 million contract for 7 Dorniers, the company ceased operations in the autumn of 1987. The end of Mailinair was complex with the shareholders agreeing in June 1987 to sell the company to Air Ecosse. Air Ecosse had itself been in administration since January 1987 and had only recently been bought by Isle of Man-based Traditional Investments for ¬£477,000.

Dietary studies of fatty liver disease in mice show that decreasing the intake of ketogenic amino acids lysine and threonine may induce hepatic steatosis, a major cause of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Lysine in particular has been shown to serve an important role in the metabolic pathway for insulin via activation of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) for which over-activation leads to insulin resistance. Further studies illustrate that ketogenic amino acid rich diets may aid in decreasing obesity and insulin resistance, but their usage remains disputed.

Anglo-Caribbean genres such as reggae, soca and calypso are especially prominent in English Canada, while French Caribbean genres such as cadence-lypso, zouk and konpa are more prominent in Quebec. Caribbean music has also been incorporated as an influence by numerous Canadian pop, rock and hip hop artists. Recent changes in Canada's immigration laws have seen several prominent musicians from the Commonwealth Caribbean, like David Rudder and Anslem Douglas, resettle in Canada and help to develop the Caribbean music industry based there.Anslem Douglas makes comeback. Trinidad and Tobago's Newsday, October 6, 2006. The role of music in the Caribbean Canadian community is reinforced by cultural festivals such as Toronto's Caribana. 1980s Although long present as an underground phenomenon, Caribbean music began to actively break through into the Canadian cultural mainstream in the 1980s ‚Äî particularly after Parachute Club, a band who incorporated reggae and soca rhythms into a mainstream new wave dance-pop style, broke through to mass popularity with their 1983 hit single \\"Rise Up\\". Their success in turn paved the way for reggae and dub poetry artists such as Leroy Sibbles, Lillian Allen, Messenjah, Clifton Joseph and Sattalites to break through to larger audiences; the Juno Awards, Canada's primary music award, introduced an award for Reggae Recording of the Year in 1985. Parachute Club percussionist Billy Bryans, whose interest in Caribbean music had been influential in the introduction of reggae and soca elements into the band's sound, also went on to become Canada's first prominent and influential promoter and producer of homegrown Caribbean and Latin American music, producing albums for and managing numerous artists and acting, according to Brazilian Canadian singer- songwriter Aline Morales, as \\"a bridge between world music and the Canadian music scene\\". 1990s Noted developments in Caribbean music in the 1990s included Jane Bunnett's early explorations of Afro-Cuban jazz, Snow's worldwide 1993 hit single \\"Informer\\", the incorporation of reggae and dub influences by blues-rock band Big Sugar, the reggae rock band Raggadeath, and the 1998 hit single \\"Who Let the Dogs Out?\\", written by Trinidadian-Canadian musician Anslem Douglas. With the Black Canadian community dominated by people of Caribbean heritage, Caribbean music also emerged as a major influence on the development of Canadian hip hop in this era ‚Äî most notably on influential albums such as Dream Warriors' And Now the Legacy Begins and Michie Mee's Jamaican Funk‚ÄîCanadian Style, which extensively incorporated reggae and other Caribbean styles. Ron Nelson has played an important role in promoting reggae in Canada through his ReggaeMania radio show, which ran on CKLN-FM from 1993 to 2011, an early and important platform for promoting Reggae music in the Toronto area for almost two decades and continues as ReggaeMania.com, an online radio station and hub, as well as his work as a music promoter and concert organizer in Toronto.http://www.torontosun.com/2012/04/19/take-a- reggae-voyage 1990s Stations like Flow FM, CHIN-FM, G98.7 and, until 2011, CKLN-FM, located in Toronto, Ontario have served to bind the Caribbean music industry with their regularly rotated scheduling for soca and calypso music. The Canadian Urban Music Awards have also begun to award various award titles in the soca and reggae genres. In 2007, Anslem Douglas who originally wrote the song \\"Who Let the Dogs Out?\\", re-entered the Caribbean music scene after a four-year hiatus. Douglas recorded several of his 2007 Carnival songs from Canada. Noted artists in the genre to emerge in this era included South Rakkas Crew and Kobo Town, both of whom have had albums nominated for the Polaris Music Prize, and Alex Cuba, a Cuban-born guitarist who has had success both as a solo artist and as a collaborator with pop singer Nelly Furtado. Singer- songwriter Danny Michel also received critical and commercial acclaim for his 2012 album Black Birds Are Dancing Over Me, recorded in Belize with a group of musicians credited as the Garifuna Collective.

Constructed in 1782 of locally produced salmon-colored brick, the Pardee House retains much of its original character and represents a significant and well-preserved vernacular expression of the late Georgian style in architecture, materials and workmanship in the State of Connecticut. The Pardee House has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing structure in the Sharon Historic District, and received its own separate listing as well in 2003. The two-story, five- bay, brick structure with a center-hall plan was constructed by James Pardee, the son of John Pardee, one of the founders of the Town of Sharon, on the town's original Proprietor Home Lot #29. According to SPNEA documentation, the Pardee House is very well preserved at the exterior, which includes the retention of most the building's original sash windows. At the interior of the Pardee House, numerous original and early features are preserved, including unusual structural framing, hand-carved woodwork, plaster on split lath, softwood floorboards and fireplaces. Located north of the Pardee House on the grounds of the original John Pardee Homestead is a ca. 1960 guest cottage. The open space of the Pardee Homestead retains its rural characteristics and consists primarily of lawn, gardens and a large open field located East of the house. In 2002, the Boston-based Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA, now Historic New England) acquired a preservation restriction on the property in perpetuity.

It was founded in 1511‚Äì12 by Aulo Giano Parrasio and has a long and complex history, with several changes of name. History The society was founded in Cosenza by Giovan Paolo Parisio (\\"Aulo Giano Parrasio\\") in late 1511 or early 1512, and was initially known as the \\"Accademia Parrasiana\\". As in other accademie of the time, the principal studies were of literature and philology. Following the death of Parrasio, which may have been in 1522 or in 1534, the academy came under the control of Bernardino Telesio, who gave it a more scientific and practical direction; it was known as the \\"Accademia Telesiana\\". In 1544 it was suppressed by the authorities. Not long before Telesio died in 1588, the society came under the direction of Sertorio Quattromani and was renamed the \\"Accademia Cosentina\\". It is not clear whether it had been active from the closure of 1544 to this time. The accademia was again closed down in about 1593. In 1608 Giovanni Battista Costanzo, the archbishop of Cosenza, re-opened the society as the Accademia dei Costanti, with a larger number of members from the church. It may have become inactive again after his death in 1617. Another archbishop, Giuseppe Sanfelice, founded the Accademia dei Negligenti in about 1649; it remained active until his death in 1660. The Accademia dei Costanti was revived by Pirro Schettini from 1668 until 1678, when he died. It was restarted under the name Accademia dei Pescatori Cratilidi by Gaetano Greco in 1756, but again became inactive in 1794. In 1811 the society was again revived, through the efforts of Matteo Galdi; it was called the Istituto Cosentina until 1817, when royal permission was obtained to change the name to Accademia Cosentina. On 11 June 1871 the Accademia Cosentina founded the Biblioteca Civica, the public library of Cosenza, which remained inactive until it was officially inaugurated on 4 March 1898. In March 2012 the academy announced that it might have to cease all activity because of a total lack of funds; it had received ‚Ç¨2000 in ministerial funding in 2008. The Accademia Cosentina is still operative, despite the economic difficulties due to the lack of public subsidies, and continues its cultural promotion work yet today, with monthly events and conferences on literary, humanistic and scientific subjects.

Empire Earth Mobile was written in Java form, and was developed by WonderPhone instead of Stainless Steel Studios (the makers of Empire Earth). It was released on October 14, 2005 by mobile games distributor WonderPhone. Gameplay Empire Earth Mobile is turn-based strategy game. The game covers four epochs; Stone, Middle, Modern and Nano. The game separates itself from the other Empire Earth games with the absence of citizens. Instead, certain symbols lie on the map which can be conquered by a soldier unit. When they are, a new building can be created. However, only a certain number of symbols exist on the map, so each side competes for control of them. Gameplay in Mobile takes place in a turn-based fashion. Mobile gives the player control of four types of units, each that varies and changes in different epochs. The standard soldier, which can be useful for building new structures, ranged units, heavy support units, and aerial units. The latter of the four is only available in later epochs. Mobile has three game modes: adventure, skirmish and multiplayer. Adventure mode takes the player though 10 campaign levels, totaling 2,000 years of human history. It begins in the Prehistory and finishes in the Nano age, similar to Empire Earth. Skirmish is a free-for-all solo battle, with multiplayer mode introducing the possibility of two player combat.

Gaus, \\"Shortridge High School 1864‚Äì1981 In Retrospect\\" (1985) Roda Selleck, who began teaching art at the school in the 1880s, soon won acclaim for introducing \\"craftwork\\" ‚Äì leather, pottery, jewelry, and metalwork ‚Äì to the curriculum, and later developed a line of pottery, \\"Selridge Pottery\\", designed by students. She remained at the school until her death in 1924. In 1876, Mary Alice Rann was the first African- American student to graduate from Shortridge High School. There was a push for either integration in schools or the building of a new school for African- American students. Abram Shortridge, who had become the superintendent of IPS schools at the time, fought against the arguments from white parents, asking if they wanted to pay the taxes to build a new school just for her. She was the first of a number of black students to graduate from Shortridge prior to the opening of Crispus Attucks High School. The Shortridge Senate was created in 1887 by Miss Laura Donnan. High school juniors and seniors would meet at 2:30 every Friday afternoon. The senate was created in order to teach students about public speaking and politics. Based on the annual Shortridge yearbook of 1918, the talking points included: daylight saving time, workmen's compensation, women's suffrage, amendments to abolish jury trials, eight-hour law, the metric system, and many others. Found in senate records located at the Indiana Historical Society. Written in 1914-1915 by the senate of Shortridge. September 18, eight female students were instated into the senate. The senate was made up of majority young women. Senators are actually students representing each actual Senator. In the case of women's suffrage, the debates the students had involved included arguments that were happening in the real debates and spanned three days, from September 25 to October 9, 1914.Shortridge Student Senate Records, 1914-1915, Box 14, BV 2389, Student Senate Records, Indiana Historical Society, Indianapolis, Indiana.  Early 20th century  In a 1903 football game against Wabash College, Wabash College coach Tug Wilson substituted an African-American left tackle by the name of Samuel Gordon, and the Shortridge captain \\"made a scene\\", forfeiting the game. Although minority students attended Shortridge from its opening, the majority of Shortridge High School students were white. This changed in 1927, when Indianapolis opened its first purposely-segregated all-black school, Crispus Attucks High School; up until then, the city had only followed school segregation by custom and not by law. Notably, the creation of Crispus Attucks was in large part due to the influence of a branch of the Ku Klux Klan led by D.C. Stephenson, on the city's school board. Regardless, those who lived in an area where they could attend either Crispus Attucks High School or Shortridge High School were allowed to choose which school they wanted to attend; many of these students chose to attend Shortridge. In 1928, Shortridge High School moved from downtown Indianapolis to a new building at its current location at 34th and Meridian Street on the north side of Indianapolis. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The environment in the school in the 1950s was described in the novel Going All The Way by Shortridge High alumnus Dan Wakefield (published in 1970 and adapted to film in 1997). In 1957, a Time Magazine article named Shortridge High as one of the top 38 high schools in the United States. At the same time, however, the school began to lose students to other schools, notably the newly opened North Central High School on the city's far-north side. Shortridge students and faculty were involved in relief efforts for World War I. Faculty in charge included Flora Love, Rosa M. R. Mikels, Mary E. Sullivan, and Virginia Claybough. Their jobs were typing, filing, and clerical work. Under direction from Red Cross, both students and teachers also knitted socks, hats, and helmets. They also purchased War Bonds. The students and teachers also provided money for the war efforts and marched in parades. Laura Donnan even had a motto in her class that was, ‚ÄúA penny in France is worth two pennies in your pants.‚Äù  Civil Rights Movement  Due to the changing racial makeup of the neighborhoods that fed Shortridge, some parents on the school's Parent-Teacher Association supported redrawing the Shortridge district to find a more even racial balance. By 1964, some felt that the school had reached a crisis. A protest march that fall from the school to Indianapolis Public Schools offices was supported by 200 students. In 1965, the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners turned Shortridge into an all-academic high school. Beginning in the 1966‚Äì67 school year, an entrance examination was required for enrollment. In the 1966‚Äì67 school year only 272 freshmen enrolled, 46% of whom were black. Though efforts were made over the next four years to increase enrollment, they were not effective. The 1966 elections saw the school board change, including the loss of Richard Lugar, a Shortridge High graduate and academic plan supporter, who ran for, and was elected as, mayor of the city of Indianapolis. By 1967, the new school board voted 5‚Äì2 to abolish the short-lived ‚ÄòShortridge Plan‚Äô. As the 1960s progressed, so-called \\"white flight\\" in the neighborhoods immediately surrounding the school led to a predominantly-black student body. During the 1950‚Äì1970 period, the racial demographics of the Shortridge district began to change rapidly. As an example, the Mapleton-Fall Creek neighborhood, a part of the Shortridge district, changed from 82% white to 20% white). The United States Department of Justice filed a suit in 1968 charging de jure segregation in Indianapolis. IPS responded with a desegregation plan which addressed only one of the three underlying charges. In 1971, U.S. District Judge S. Hugh Dillin found the IPS Board of School Commissioners to be guilty of de jure segregation.Scott D Seay, ‚ÄúThe Shortridge Incident: Christian Theological Seminary as an agent of Reconciliation‚Äù CTS journal, Encounter, Spring 2007 Many large and small protests and causes occurred at Shortridge during the late 1960s. This was a trend seen at other local high schools, colleges, and American society in general. One in particular is sometimes referred to as \\"The Shortridge Incident.\\" In February 1969, Shortridge student Otto Breeding was arrested for \\"disorderly conduct\\" after a disagreement with school officials over appropriate clothing. He had been asked to not wear a T-shirt advertising a radical black organization. Students who felt this was unfair attempted to disrupt the school, pulling fire alarms, and chanting ‚ÄúBlack Power‚Äù in the halls. The next day an ad hoc group of students presented the assistant principal with four demands. The response to the petition did not satisfy them. The Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra was scheduled to present a concert the next day in the school's historic auditorium, Caleb Mills Hall. Approximately twenty students rose and left as the orchestra played \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". The protesters then congregated at a youth project run by the Reverend Luther Hicks. Reverend Hicks calmed the students and helped them to plan a non-violent protest. The students returned to Shortridge and gathered in front of the building and shouted various protest chants (e.g. ‚ÄúSay it loud! I‚Äôm black and I‚Äôm proud.‚Äù). As the protest continued, the police were called, and thirty students and adults were taken to the Marion County Jail. Most were charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. One civil rights leader, Griffin Bell, was charged with inciting a riot. Marion County Prosecutor Noble Pearcy attempted to have the minor students declared \\"incorrigible\\" in an attempt to stop school unrest. This caused mixed reactions within the community, leading some of the city's religious leaders to side with the students. While the charges wound their way through the courts, a \\"freedom school\\" was set up to help the suspended students keep up with their academic work. The case eventually reached the Indiana Supreme Court to decide jurisdiction. Eventually, all charges against the students were dismissed and three civil rights leaders were given fines, with one receiving six months at the Indiana State Prison Farm.  Recent years  Shortridge High School was closed for several years beginning in 1981. Following a major renovation, Shortridge was then reopened in 1984 as a middle school for grades 6 to 8. In 2009, a high school magnet program for grades 9 to 12 that was focused on law and public policy was added. In 2015, that magnet program was moved to Arsenal Technical High School and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program was moved from Gambold Preparatory High School to Shortridge High School. Some Shortridge families at the time argued the move was primarily designed to cater to wealthier white families while forcing poorer children and children of color out of the school. In 2018, the entire Indianapolis Public Schools district was reorganized so that all high school students would choose which school they would attend. Several schools were closed in order to strengthen the four remaining high schools: Shortridge, Crispus Attucks, Washington, and Arsenal Tech. In addition to providing a typical high school curriculum, each high school now offers a concentrated program in a specific field. Shortridge retained its International Baccalaureate program and added the system's Arts and Humanities program that had been previously hosted at the former Broad Ripple High School. In 2013, the band Tenth Avenue North performed in the historic auditorium. Previously, in 1981, Carl Perkins performed there.  The Shortridge Daily Echo  In 1898, the school established a daily newspaper, The Shortridge Daily Echo. It was the first daily high school newspaper in the entire country. It continued its daily status until the 1970s, when it was converted to a weekly publication. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr, and Donald Ring Mellett are two notable alumni who served as editors of the Echo. The paper won many awards over the years. In its final year, a much-abbreviated Echo still won the second place overall award from the Columbia University Scholastic Press Association. Michael N. Selby and Edie Cassell were the last co-editors-in- chief, and Chris Keys was the last sports editor of the Shortridge Weekly Echo when it ceased publication with the school's closure in 1981. When Shortridge was reopened as a high school in 2009, students brought back the Echo as well and has been published as either a daily or weekly.  Influential women in Shortridge history  May Wright Sewall taught English and German from 1872 to 1880 and was influential in the women's suffrage movement. Laura Donnan was an active mentor, teaching Latin, history, and geometry. She taught for 45 years starting in 1883. In addition, she was also the coach of the women's basketball team and the first sponsor of the Shortridge Daily Echo. Charity Dye taught English at Shortridge from 1900 to 1912. She is known for her production of plays based on historical events This led to her to be appointed to Indiana's historical commission, the only woman on the commission. She was an advocate for women's suffrage, and authored a pamphlet urging the observation of Peace Day on May 18, 1912, in Indiana. School #27 was named after her. She also authored The James Whitcomb Riley Reader, Some Torch Bearers in Indiana, and The Story-Teller‚Äôs Art, among others. Dye organized the Browning Society of Indianapolis. Because of her influence, the Charity Dye Library was established in the original Shortridge building. Mary Ritter Beard graduated as valedictorian of her high school class at Shortridge in 1893. She later went on to be influential in the women's suffrage movement.  Sports  In a state where basketball is king, Shortridge High had its moment in the sun in the 1967‚Äì68 season. The Blue Devils won their way to the final game of the Indiana state championship, only to lose by eight points. However, over the years Shortridge High won state championships in golf (five titles, three times runners-up), wrestling (twice), track and field (twice, and runners-up twice), and cross country (twice, and runners-up twice). Late in the 1970s the Blue Devils began to emerge as baseball power in the city. The Blue Devils reached the sectional finals in 1979, despite fielding a team of mostly sophomores. Notably Eric Johnson, a sophomore transfer from southern California, set a school record in 1979 by posting 12 Runs batted in, in a single game against Arsenal Technical High School.

He was the head of the Ibru Organization, one of the largest conglomerates in Nigeria. As a traditional chieftain of his homeland, Ibru bore the tribal honorific Olorogun and often used it as a pre-nominal style. This title is also borne by many of the members of his large family in the same way. Early life Ibru was born to the family of Janet Ibru and Peter Ibru, a missionary worker, who also worked at the Igbobi Orthapaedic Hospital, Lagos. After secondary school, he joined the United African Company, as a management trainee. In 1956, a few years after joining U.A.C, he dropped out of the company and started a partnership, which he called Laibru. The corporate entity was in partnership with an expatriate, Jimmy Large. After engaging in general trading with some success, in 1957, Michael Ibru discovered that the frozen fish market was a fertile market with the potential to deliver returns above the market rate. However, it was a tough market to penetrate, at the time, many expatriate firms and Nigerian traders were lacking and some were not interested in the market. But he felt he could put extra effort communicating with general traders, who played key roles in products acceptance. To trade in seafood, he established an importing company, he also rented and built cold storage facilities across the country. By the mid-1960s trading fish had become the traditional money maker for the Ibru organization. Though he had other profitable interests such as transportation and construction, fish trading helped him secure financing and other forms of capital to engage in large scale trading. He established a partnership with a Taiwanese company, Osadjere Fishing Company, which provided Trawlers and other accessories for trading. By the end of the 1960s he branched out fully into other areas of the economy. Like a lot of his contemporaries, he established a transportation company, called Rutam. He also invested in palm oil production. Over the years, the Ibru Organization has expanded into other areas such as Tourism, Brewery, Timber and Poultry. He was known as an entrepreneurial figure who created one of the largest modern Nigerian owned groups with other figures such as the low key Bode Akindele. Education Michael Ibru attended Igbobi College, and acquired a school certificate in 1951. Urhobo nation No group of Nigerians has benefited more from Michael Ibru's legacy than the Urhobo people. Urhobo men and women have profited at many levels since the rise of the Ibru brand in the second half of the 1950s. First, Urhobo market women were among the first batch of Nigerians to embrace the \\"Ibru\\" frozen fish. Many of them rose from relative poverty to higher economic brackets because they participated in the new Ibru ventures from market stalls. There were more direct beneficiaries from Michael Ibru's openness to his Urhobo people. These were the many Urhobo professionals who joined the Ibru organization. Many of them left the Ibru organization to pursue their own independent dreams constructed with the aid of ambitions conceived in the Ibru organization. A full list of Urhobo professionals who worked and prospered in the Ibru organization will fill many pages. The Urhobo have a more particular reason for admiring Michael Ibru. Well up to the 1950s, the image of the Urhobo was not among the best in the Nigerian nation. With the accomplishments and competence of Michael Ibru especially, as well as the achievements of other giants of Nigerian commerce and economics as David Dafinone and Gamaliel Onosode, the Urhobo image has been strengthened in major ways. For that, the Urhobo have embraced Michael Ibru as an historic figure. There is more in the love bonds between the Urhobo people and Michael Ibru. Michael Ibru has embraced Urhobo culture and Urhobo cultural organizations, especially Urhobo Progress Union, in a manner that pleases the Urhobo people. It is Michael Ibru who popularized the use of the title \\"Olorogun\\" in place of \\"Chief.\\"http://www.waado.org/Biographies/ibru_michael/ibru_80_ekeh.htm Private citizen Chief Ibru has five wives, and seventeen children, the most prominent being Olorogun Oskar Ibru (who heads Ibafon Ports) and Oboden Ibru (who was a key player in Oceanic bank International PLC). He also tried his hands in politics, in 1983, he was a gubernatorial candidate but lost to Samuel Ogbemudia. He is also a member of the Liberal Convention and the New Movement, which metamorphosed to become NRC. Death Ibru, who was the patriarch of one of Nigeria's foremost business dynasties, died at a medical facility in the United States in the early hours of Tuesday, September 6, 2016. Ibru was survived by his brother, Goodie Ibru; his wife, Cecilia Ibru; and several children, including Oskar Ibru and Oboden Ibru; and grandchildren.

Redheaded Peckerwood was awarded the Rencontres d'Arles Author Book Award in 2012 and Patterson has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Vevey International Photography Award.  Biography  In 2002, Patterson moved from Brooklyn, New York to Memphis, Tennessee to work with the photographer William Eggleston. In 2005, he completed his first project, Sound Affects, a collection of color photographs that explore Memphis as a visual and musical place, and use light and color as visual analogues to sound and music. In 2008, a Sound Affects book was published by Edition Kaune, Sudendorf. Also in 2005, Patterson began working on his second project, Redheaded Peckerwood, which is loosely inspired by the late 1950s killing spree of Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate across Nebraska. Photographs are the heart of this work, but they are complemented and informed by documents and objects that belonged to the killers and their victims. Later that year, Patterson moved back to New York. In 2011, a Redheaded Peckerwood book was published by Mack and named one of the best photobooks of the year by many critics. The book was nominated for the 2012 Kraszna-Krausz Book Awards and won the 2012 Recontres d'Arles Author Book Award. It is introduced in The Photobook: A History, Vol. 3, edited by Gerry Badger and Martin Parr. In 2015, Patterson completed Bottom of the Lake, a project revisiting his hometown of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin (French for \\"Bottom of the Lake\\"). A book was published by Koenig Books and takes the form of a facsimile of the artist's family's 1973 telephone book from Fond du Lac, with Patterson's own photographs, drawings and notes inserted. Like Redheaded Peckerwood, this new work mixes large-format colour landscapes, black-and- white snapshots, appropriated and manipulated archival images, and studio still lifes.

Behemoth the Sea Monster in the U.K. and The Behemoth) is a 1959 black-and-white science fiction giant monster film distributed by Allied Artists Pictures. The film was produced by Ted Lloyd, directed by Eug√®ne Louri√©, and stars Gene Evans and Andr√© Morell. The screenplay was written by blacklisted author Daniel James (under the name \\"Daniel Hyatt\\") with director Louri√©. Originally a story about an amorphous blob of radiation, the script was changed at the distributor's insistence to a style similar to The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953), though elements of the original concept remain in the early parts of the film and in the \\"nuclear- breathing\\" power of the titular monster. Plot Scientist Steve Karnes delivers a speech to a British scientific society, led by Professor James Bickford, about the dangers to marine life posed by nuclear testing. Before Karnes can return to the United States, a real-life example of his concern materializes when a fisherman in Looe, Cornwall is killed on the beach, and his dying word is \\"behemoth\\". Later, thousands of dead fish are washed ashore. Karnes and Bickford travel to Cornwall to investigate the fisherman's death and, although his injuries seem to include radiation burns, they find no evidence of radiation on the beach. Then, Karnes goes to inspect a passenger ship found wrecked and badly damaged, with the loss of all on board. Back in London, the two scientists discover that samples of the dead fish contain large amounts of radioactive contamination. Karnes begins to suspect that the \\"behemoth\\" that the fisherman described seeing is some kind of large marine mammal that has mutated as a result of being contaminated by nuclear testing. The next attack is on a farm near the coast in Essex. A photo of the area reveals a huge footprint and paleontologist Dr. Sampson identifies the creature as a Paleosaurus, an aquatic dinosaur that emits an electric pulse, like an electric eel. Karnes believes that the dinosaur is saturated by radiation, which is transmitted by the electric pulse, resulting in the burns seen on the fisherman and other victims. The radiation is also slowly killing the dinosaur. According to Dr. Samson, the dying creature will leave the ocean depths to head upstream, seeking out the shallow waters where it was born, but death by radiation may not come soon enough to prevent the creature from wreaking havoc on London along the way. Karnes and Bickford try to persuade authorities to close the River Thames, but the military officer believes that their radar tracking systems will be enough to detect the behemoth and prevent it from getting near the city. Unfortunately, the dinosaur appears to be invisible to radar. Dr. Sampson and some other scientists spot it from a Royal Navy helicopter, but the radar equipment tracking the helicopter sees no sign of the beast, which destroys the helicopter when it gets too close. Soon, the behemoth surfaces in the Thames and capsizes the Woolwich Ferry. Rising from the river, the creature rampages through the city, flattening cars and destroying buildings. Bickford and Karnes advise the military that the best way to kill the beast will be to administer a dose of radium, hoping to accelerate the radiation sickness that is already slowly killing it. While they prepare the dose, the behemoth continues its rampage, eventually plummeting through London Bridge back into the Thames. Karnes and Bickford set their plan into action. An X-class submarine with Karnes on board carries a torpedo filled with radium into the Thames in pursuit of the monster. During an initial pass, the behemoth takes a bite out of the mini-sub, but Karnes convinces the submarine captain to have another go. This time, they succeed in firing the torpedo into the monster's mouth, and the behemoth roars in pain. Observers in helicopters later confirm the monster's demise. As Karnes and Bickford climb into a car to leave the area, they hear a radio report of dead fish washing up on the eastern shores of the United States.

Reception American film critic Andrew Wickliffe considered the lead up to the appearance of the monster to be more interesting than the rampage that follows, writing, \\"I'm not sure the British are really suited for giant monster movies. No offense to the Brits, but watching a bunch of folks stand around and keep the stiff upper lip while radioactive monsters from the deep attack London isn't too much fun\\".Wickliffe, Andrew (May 29, 2006) \\"Behemoth, The Sea Monster (1959), Eug√®ne Louri√©\\".

Regarding a later release of the film in a package with other science fiction features, film reviewer Glenn Erickson observed that The Giant Behemoth was derivative, speculating that \\"... director Eug√®ne Louri√© apparently instructed writers Robert Abel and Alan Adler to repackage his original The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, copying whole scenes and situations.

Both \\"Voord\\" and \\"Voords\\" have been used as the plural form. The Voord were conceived by science-fiction writer Terry Nation and first appeared in the 1964 Doctor Who serial The Keys of Marinus. They later appeared in Doctor Who stories in other formats. In one of those stories, written by Grant Morrison, the Voord are revealed to have evolved into the iconic Doctor Who villains the Cybermen. The Keys of Marinus The Voord were conceived as the villains for the season 1 Doctor Who serial The Keys of Marinus by writer Terry Nation, who previously conceived of the Daleks for an earlier season 1 Doctor Who story. As with the Daleks, Nation's script left the description of the Voord vague, and the design was developed by costume designer Daphne Dare. Freelance contractors Dave and John Lovell created the three heads and three pairs of black gloves that were used as part of the Voord costumes for less than 70 pounds. The Voord were portrayed by actors Martin Cort, Peter Stenson and Gordon Wales and their leader Yartek by Stephen Dartnell. Author Dave Thompson described the Voord as \\"black amphibious humanoids.\\" Authors Tat Woods and Lawrence Miles descrive them as \\"web-footed human beings in black frogman outfits.\\" Authors David J. Howe, Mark Stammers and Stephen James Walker describe them as \\"rubber suited assailants.\\" Howe and Walker describe the Voords' wetsuit costumes as \\"clich√©d but surprisingly effective.\\" They describe the helmets as being \\"cleverly designed,\\" containing different shaped antennae for all the Voord except Yartek. Woods and Miles describe the \\"wedge- shaped helmets\\" with antennae as suggesting an \\"evil Teletubby.\\" Woods and Miles also take certain clues from the story to suggest that the Voord may actually look like humans under their outfits. Their wet suits are acid-proof but can tear. The Voord weapons include a dagger and a ray gun. Woods and Miles compare their submarine to a squeegee bottle. Woods and Miles note that the Voord are very clumsy. They state that the commando raid the Voord enact in \\"suggests they were trained by Norman Wisdom,\\" further stating that \\"if there's a hidden death trap to stumble into, then they'll find it, usually in the most slapstick way imaginable.\\" One trips on his own flippers and another (portrayed by the same actor, Peter Stenson) stabs himself in the back. The Voord were regarded as the main villains of The Keys of Marinus despite the fact that they only appeared in the first and last episodes of this six part story. In the plot, the Voord, including their leader Yartek, have developed resistance to the Conscience of Marinus, which eliminates fear and aggression from the inhabitants of Marinus, and want to use the device for their own evil purposes. They are defeated when the Doctor's companion Ian Chesterton tricks them into destroying the machine. The Voord are killed in the resulting explosion, although it is left ambiguous as to whether Yartek escapes the explosion. Later appearances The Voord appeared in the first edition of Doctor Who Annual in September 1965. A Voord was shown on the cover of the book along with a representative three other Doctor Who races, a Sensorite, a Zarbi and a Menoptra. The Voord appeared in the magazine in a story called \\"The Fishmen of Kandalinga.\\" The story told of Voord who escaped from the planet Marinus after their defeat by the First Doctor, who then attempted to enslave a mutant race of fish people on their new planet but were stopped by the First Doctor and his companions. Also in 1965, the Voord appeared in a series of trading cards put out by Cadet Sweets with their candy cigarettes. The cards told a story in which the Voord were defeated by the Daleks. In 1980 they appeared in the novelization of The Keys of Marinus, Doctor Who and the Keys of Marinus, written by Philip Hinchcliffe and published by Target Books. The Voord later appeared in a comic strip story \\"The World Shapers\\" written by Grant Morrison within Doctor Who Magazine issues 127 through 129. In this story, involving the Sixth Doctor and Peri Brown, the Voord are revealed to be evolving into the Cybermen. The Doctor discovers that the Time Lords could prevent this from occurring but they refuse to, despite the Doctor's pleas. In the 1999 novel Interference ‚Äì Book Two, Kode finds a book in the TARDIS library noting that the Voord's fetishistic apparel and receiver aerials are similar to those of the Remote, another media-dependent culture. It speculates that Marinus is an early experiment by the Remote's creators, Faction Paradox, and that the Voord might be considered the Remote's direct ancestors. In September 2014 the Voord appeared in a Big Finish Productions story entitled Domain of the Voord. The cast includes William Russell and Carole Ann Ford, as the Doctor's companions Ian Chesterton and Susan Foreman respectively, reprising the roles they played in The Keys of Marinus. The script is by Andrew Smith, who previously wrote the Fourth Doctor story Full Circle in 1980. The Voord appear in the Titan Comics multi-Doctor event \\"Four Doctors\\", opposite the Twelfth, Eleventh and Tenth Doctors. It is revealed that they evolved during the Time War and fought alongside the War Doctor against the Daleks. After the war they attempted to retain their new advanced capabilities, which include a hive consciousness and the ability to absorb anyone into the Voord collective, they removed themselves and Marinus into a pocket dimension, erasing all memory of Marinus from the universe (including the Doctor). Allying with an alternate reality version of the Twelfth Doctor, who became villainous after being betrayed by Clara Oswald (in \\"Dark Water\\"), the Voord were eventually defeated by the earlier Twelfth Doctor, along with the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors. Impact The Voord were the first Doctor Who alien race to be marketed as the successor to Terry Nation's previous alien creation, the Daleks. Despite attempts to merchandise the Voord, they never achieved the popularity of the Daleks. Author Peter Haining notes that they did achieve \\"some fame and recognition through merchandising spin-offs. Amicus Productions, which made two Dalek movies, acquired the movie rights to The Keys of Marinus but the movie was never made. Doctor Who author Dave Thompson, however, regards them as \\"one of the show's most sadly underused alien menaces.\\" He also describes them as \\"one of the show's least loved (but actually most enjoyable) alien menaces.\\" in 1979 Stephen Poole wrote that limiting the Voord to just the first and last episodes of The Keys of Marinus was \\"a great waste of potential.\\" Voord actor Peter Stenson later wrote about his experience portraying a Voord for a leather fetish magazine.

Alfred lived with them until he left school. Like his brother Walter, Alfred went as a boarder to Gresham's School, Holt. He was there between 1910 and 1914, becoming a House Prefect. Military service Whilst at Gresham's School, Alfred had been in the Junior Division of the Officers' Training Corps from January 1910 to August 1914, when, with war apparent, he joined the British Army. On 10 December 1915, he filed an \\"application for appointment to a temporary commission in the regular army for the period of the war\\". As he was under 21 years of age, the application had to be signed by his guardian, Clara Collet, who was taking care of him since his father's death.

The 156th episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 21, 2007. In the episode, all the students at South Park Elementary are checked for head lice and, to his horror, Clyde discovers that he has lice. He tries to hide it from his classmates, knowing they will make fun of (if not torture) him. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. Plot Mrs. Garrison announces to the class that, due to another school having a head lice problem, every student must now be checked. During the check, Clyde is informed that he has head lice, much to his horror. The nurse gives him a note and he goes to the doctor, who prescribes Clyde a special shampoo to deal with the problem, but Clyde remains shocked and embarrassed by the situation and lies about it, knowing the other kids are going to bully and pick on him. Meanwhile, from on top of Clyde's head, the lice are living peacefully in a village until one of them, Travis, witnesses the nurse parting Clyde's hair and sees her as a gigantic eye in the sky staring down at him. Travis tells the other lice the \\"world\\" has become aware of them and is angry, that they need to move away, but he is ridiculed by everyone. That night, Clyde washes his hair with the shampoo, killing most of the lice. Travis' wife Kelly is killed, but Travis, their baby Hope and a handful of other lice, including the villainous Vice President, Greg, survive. The next day in class, the kids ask Mrs. Garrison if somebody did have lice. Mrs. Garrison tells the children that someone had lice but refuses to reveal who because of a policy in school. The kids begin to suspect each other and plot to discover who had the lice in order to both evade and humiliate them. Cartman eventually devises a test to tell who had head lice (a parody of the blood test in the 1982 horror film The Thing, something even Kyle points out and calls Cartman out on), and rigs it to frame Kenny, whom he assumes has lice because of the fact he is poor and therefore has bad hygiene - according to Cartman only poor people get lice. Kenny flees the room, and Clyde is somewhat sympathetic yet relieved. Back on Clyde's head, the few survivors of the disaster gather and Travis tells them that they must flee the world for another better one that welcomes them, and to do so they must go to the \\"Forbidden Zone\\" beyond the forest. While other lice stay behind to find other survivors, Travis, Greg and another survivor go to the \\"Forbidden Zone\\". There, Greg fatally shoots the other survivor. He then aims at Travis and tells him he will rebuild the village and finally become President and that there's no room for deep thinkers like him. While taunting Travis (at the same time shooting both his kneecaps), Greg mocks Travis' theories of a living world that's self-aware and conscious. To drive home his point, he shoots the \\"ground\\" several times, stating that if the world was indeed alive it would feel the gunshots and react. In that moment Clyde reaches up to the back of his neck, picking up the surprised and screaming Greg and tossing him away to his death. The wounded Travis can do little more but laughs up to the sky, as he clutches tightly his precious little nit/Hope. The boys manage to track Kenny down to the park, where they intend to punish him, each carrying a bar of soap in a sock as their weapon. They tell Clyde to come, but before he does, filled with guilt he calls Mrs. Garrison to warn her of Kenny's danger. Kenny is caught in the park, stripped to his underwear and given what Cartman calls a \\"sock bath\\" (i.e. washed with the soap then dried with the socks). Then, Kyle forces everyone to stop, that he cannot go through with it, can't let Kenny take the fall for him, and admits that he's the one who had lice; much to Clyde's surprise. Stan, then Cartman also come forward admitting to the same thing; just then, Mrs. Garrison shows up and tells the boys that everyone (boys and girls alike) in the class had head lice, as it spreads extremely quickly, and then leaves while calling the kids \\"dumbasses.\\" In response to this, the boys nevertheless proceed with the sock bath for Kenny's lies and denial of having lice. On Clyde's head, Travis, near apparent death, sees an apparition of Kelly in the sky flying towards him like an 'angel' (a soprano in the music score sings \\"Pie Jesu\\" from Faur√©'s \\"Requiem\\".) The apparition turns out instead to be a housefly, and Travis, still tightly holding his child, grabs on to one of its legs before it flies off. The fly finally lands on another world/body and Travis is glad to be eagerly welcomed by its populace, larger, red/brown-colored lice at a much grander, well established city; and is told they have lived in peace for many a generation, having \\"never been disturbed\\". The shot zooms out from the 'trees' and out from between someone's legs, revealing that they are living on a celebrity, just then stepping out of a limo at a red-carpet event. Camera flashes go off, just as someone announces : \\"Ladies and gentlemen, it's Angelina Jolie\\" (who then waves and greets everyone, 'Hello', whilst proceeding to a quick scratch of her pubic area). Reception IGN rated this episode 7.5 out of 10: \\"South Park often parodies the overblown drama found in Hollywood blockbuster movies, and this is [sic] episode is a disaster parody of sorts...It seems like the episode had larger ambitions, but becomes bogged down in the parody bit with the lice.\\" For the week of March 19 to March 25, 2007, this episode of South Park was the 13th- most-watched cable program, with 3.1 million viewers.

She mainly researched algebra, and wrote seventeen research papers on subjects such as nilpotent algebras, division algebras, modular invariants, and the arithmetic of algebras. Background Hazlett was born in Cincinnati, Ohio but grew up in Boston, Massachusetts where she attended public school. In 1912 she received her bachelor's degree from Radcliffe College. She then attended the University of Chicago for her master's degree (1913) and Ph.D. (1915), for which she wrote a thesis titled On the Classification and Invariantive Characterization of Nilpotent Algebras with L. E. Dickson as thesis advisor. After receiving her doctoral degree Hazlett was awarded an Alice Freeman Palmer Fellowship by Harvard, which allowed her to research invariants of nilpotent algebras at Wellesley College for the next year. Career In 1916 she was appointed to Bryn Mawr College, where she worked for two years before accepting an appointment as assistant professor at Mount Holyoke College. She was promoted to associate professor in 1924, the same year she gave a talk on The Arithmetic of a General Associative Algebra at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Toronto, but in 1925 she left Mount Holyoke because she felt she was not given enough time or resources to pursue her research in algebra. It was then that she took a job as assistant professor at the University of Illinois, where she would spend the rest of her career. In 1928 Hazlett received a Guggenheim Fellowship that allowed her to spend a year visiting Italy, Germany, and Switzerland. While in Italy she presented a paper called Integers as Matrices to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Bologna. Near the end of her visits she requested an extension of her Guggenheim Fellowship, which was granted and allowed her to spend another year in Europe. When she finally returned to the University of Illinois in 1930, she was promoted to associate professor and received a pay raise. However, her teaching schedule was rigorous and required her to teach service courses to large classes of non-math-majors, and after 1930 she did not publish any more research papers. In 1935 she wrote to the chair of the mathematics department complaining that the service courses left her no time for research, but her teaching schedule was not changed and by December 1936 she took a sick leave after having a mental breakdown from the stress of her job. The sick leave was supposed to end in August 1937, but her health had not improved enough by this time and she took another year off. She was, however, able to return to teaching by the end of 1938. In 1940, she was appointed a member of the American Mathematical Society's Cryptanalysis Committee, for which she worked until the end of World War II. She maintained her teaching job for most of this period, though, (except for taking leave in 1944-45) and went to great lengths to keep her Cryptanalysis Committee work secret. Her health, however, continued to deteriorate, and in 1946 the University of Illinois placed her on permanent disability leave. In 1959 she officially retired from the University of Illinois as an Associate Professor Emerita. She lived the rest of her life at her home in Peterborough, New Hampshire.

About half of the 44 Universals that were built between 1926 and 1931 in the United States were used in Canada. Among the famous pilots who flew the Fokker Universal were Punch Dickins and Walter Gilbert. Design and development Anthony Fokker established the Atlantic Aircraft Corporation at the Teterboro Airport in Teterboro, New Jersey. One of his first ventures for the new company was building other aircraft under license. In 1926, he formulated plans to create an original aircraft designed for utility and air transport. The design was spearheaded by Robert Noorduyn and based on conventional Fokker designs. The mixed-material construction featured a welded steel tube frame for the fuselage and tail surfaces that were covered in fabric as well as a large wing constructed of wood with a wingspan of 14.55 m, mounted above the fuselage. Although the overall design was quite \\"clean,\\" all cables, horns and attachments were mounted externally, adding considerably to the drag. When the Fokker Universal (known within Fokker as the Model 4) was first developed in 1925, it had a 149 kW (200 hp) Wright J-4 or a 164 kW (220 hp) J-5 engine. The later Standard Universal version was powered by a 246 kW (330 hp) Wright J-6-9 engine. Two gasoline tanks were mounted in the wings near the forward edge. As typical of the era, the pilot sat in an open cockpit forward of the wing‚Äôs leading edge. The enclosed cabin below and to the rear of the pilot held four to six passengers or could be fitted for cargo hauling. Cargo capacity was estimated to be approximately 427 kg (940 lb); fuel capacity was 280 l (78 US gal) or 213 kg (468 lb) They were sold new at the factory in 1927 for $14,200. At a time when Fokker America was mostly producing local versions of aircraft designed in the Netherlands, the Universal reversed this situation by becoming an American-designed aircraft produced by the parent company as the Fokker F.XI (although Fokker F.XI and Universal were not identical). Operational history Powered by the newly developed, air-cooled Wright R-790 Whirlwind radial engine which proved to be reliable, the Universal became widely regarded as a good choice for small air carriers and operators. The rugged utility aircraft proved it could haul cargo or passengers and its unique shock absorber system made of bungee cords enabled it to land on bumpy and uneven landing strips. Configurations could be readily changed from landplane to seaplane equipped with floats or if fitted with skis, the Universal could be used on rough ice and snow surfaces. An order for 12 Universals was placed by Western Canada Airways when its owner, James Armstrong Richardson, Sr. judged that the Standard Universal was the best available transport for use in the northern regions of Canada.Molson 1974, p. 20. Six more Universals (G-CAHE - CAHJ) were ordered by the Canadian Government for use in the Hudson Strait Expedition (1927‚Äì1928) to study ice formation and navigation in the Hudson Strait prior to the building of the port of Churchill, Manitoba. While not specifically designed for long-distance flights, the Universal was suitable for pioneering work. Charles Lindbergh had wanted to fly a Universal on his transatlantic flight but officials at the Atlantic Aircraft Corporation who reviewed his request in 1926, thought that Lindbergh's plans were too risky. More concerned about the company's reputation rather than the pilot's well- being, they would not sell him an aircraft. The Universal provided steady if unspectacular service with more than half of the Universals utilized for bush flying while more than a dozen United States, Canadian and foreign airlines flew it as a passenger/cargo transport. A further development, the Super Universal was larger and more refined with a fully enclosed cockpit. The follow-up design soon supplanted the Universal on the Atlantic Aircraft Corporation's production lines. Universals continued to fly well into the 1930s but were primarily relegated to cargo work. Surviving aircraft Fokker Standard Universal G-CAJD is also known as \\"The Ghost of Charron Lake\\". It was lost in a snow storm on 10 December 1931. After a 30-year search for the rare bush plane, it was discovered in 2005. A Western Canada Aviation Museum search team (the Fokker Aircraft Recovery Team, F.A.R.T.), using sophisticated side scan sonar technology, finally located the aircraft literally \\"parked\\" on the lake bottom. In July 2006, the Ghost's engine was returned to Winnipeg, along with several artifacts. In October, the underwater archaeology team returned to the recovery site and towed the tail section to shallower waters. A further expedition was undertaken in 2007 to recover more of the Fokker for future display at the museum. Larger and smaller components are presently in storage at the Western Canada Aviation Museum. A decision as to restoration or conservation of the recovered material has not been made at present.\\"The Ghost of Charron Lake\\". prairiedogguide.tripod.com, Retrieved 23 October 2010\\"The Ghost Of Charron Lake: Fokker Standard Universal\\" .

He was born in London, England on March 4, 1792, the son of merchant mariner Cornelius Flower and Margaret Nicholson. Anthony Flower arrived in the New World in the fall of 1817 on his father's ship the Trent. By the spring of 1818 he was the owner of farmland on the banks of the Washademoak Lake at MacDonald's Corner, Queens County, New Brunswick. There he built a small frame house. In 1820 he married Mary Green, a local woman and the daughter of Loyalists James Green and Elizabeth Carpenter. Anthony and Mary had four children: Cornelius, Margaret, James and Mary. Mary Green Flower, \\"his dear dear\\", died September 13, 1867, at six o'clock in the evening. Anthony Flower continued to farm and paint until his sudden death, Thursday, December 9, 1875, at the home of his friend, Brother William Briggs. He is buried in the MacDonald's Corner Baptist Church Cemetery. Anthony Flower painted throughout his life. It is clear he had some training in art and was painting before he left England. His earliest surviving work, a watercolour, was painted when he was twelve. His primary medium was watercolour but by the 1840s he was beginning to experiment with oils. He used papers of various sizes and quality, painted some works on wood or leather as well as canvas, and sometimes resorted to using both sides of the paper. Some of his later works also include carved frames and paintings on board with elaborately carved details to enhance the subject. His palette at any one time was relatively limited, and his work can sometimes be dated by noting the colours he used. The numerous portraits of his family and friends indicate the prominent role they played in his life. His landscapes and portrait copies reveal a keen intellect and a curiosity about the world around him. In 2006, an exhibition of his works, some 200 in all, was exhibited at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery and subsequently traveled to other venues in Atlantic Canada. The works include landscapes of his own and neighbouring farms, and portraits of family members. As one of the rare regional artists to emerge from nineteenth century New Brunswick, his work \\"opens a window on a time and place now gone\\". His house was restored by Queens County Heritage and opened to the public in 2008. The Anthony Flower House Museum & Gallery tells the story of a family, community and province through two centuries. The story of Anthony Flower as an artist, a farmer, a father, an immigrant, and a community leader reflects the broader history of New Brunswick and Canada. The only inhabitants of the house were Anthony Flower's descendants and their wives, with the last resident being James H. Flower who used it as a summer home for several decades. In 2002 it was donated to Queens County Heritage and subsequently moved to its current site in Cambridge-Narrows, New Brunswick in 2003. Queens County Heritage has the largest collection of Anthony Flower's paintings in a public institution and the parlour of his house has been refurbished as a small art gallery to feature selections of his work.

When an overshooting top is present for 10 minutes or longer, it is a strong indication that the storm is severe.Chance Hayes, National Weather Service Wichita, Kansas. \\"Storm Fury on the Plains.\\" Storm Spotter Training. 4H Building, Salina, Kansas. 22 Feb. 2010. Lecture.  Formation  Overshooting top of a cumulonimbus viewed from a plane crossing the Democratic Republic of Congo. Airliners typically fly at an altitude ranging from 10 km to 13 km, at the tropopause. When a thunderstorm forms, clouds build vertically into the atmosphere until the storm's updraft (warm rising air) has reached an equilibrium level (EL); the point where the surrounding air is about the same temperature or even warmer. This point of equilibrium is often marked by the tropopause. Rather than continuing to rise into the stratosphere, the vertical cloud growth abruptly stops, and instead clouds spread horizontally, forming an \\"anvil\\" shape on top of the thunderstorm. An overshooting top forms when a thunderstorm's updraft, due to momentum from rapid ascent and strength of lifting through the free convective layer (FCL), protrudes its equilibrium level, forming a dome-like structure above the anvil. This can occur with any cumulonimbus cloud when instability is high. Whereas anvils form at the equilibrium level, overshooting tops continue to the maximum parcel level (MPL).  Severe weather  Diagram of a supercell thunderstorm, which shows the overshooting top rising above the anvil cloud. Many thunderstorms exhibit an overshooting top at some point in their life cycle. In weaker thunderstorms, the overshooting top is short-lived, and often takes on a wispy appearance. If the overshooting top is rising and falling in a cyclical fashion with each protrusion persisting only a few minutes, then it could indicate the storm is pulsing and not as strong as a storm with a continuous overshooting top. An overshooting top lasting for more than 10 minutes is a sign of a strong updraft in a thunderstorm, indicating a strong likelihood the storm is producing severe weather. If the overshooting top is continuous, it's an indication of enhanced probability that the storm is a supercell, i.e. a rotating storm. During a strong tornado, the overshooting top may roll or fold over as new activity climbs up the back while the front of the overshooting top collapses into the storm. During a long-track tornado, the entire top of the storm, including the overshooting top, may drop by thousands of feet.  Storm features  A storm powerful enough to produce a lasting overshooting top typically produces the following: * Heavy rain; a deluge of rain could fall from this storm in a short amount of time. * Strong straight-line wind from downbursts; the storm clouds have powerful winds churning inside them. These winds are likely to be felt at the surface and also a threat to aviation aloft. * Sometimes a tornado may form; most strong tornadoes are associated with mesocyclones located near the interchange of the rotating updraft and the rear flank downdraft (RFD). * Hail; if the updraft is strong enough to produce an overshooting top it can also carry large hail. * Lightning; this is sure to be a thunderstorm (note that towering cumulus can produce lightning but will not possess an overshooting top).

ATR had its beginnings in the late 1980s when Atlanta was bidding for the 1996 Olympic Games. The company ‚Äì originally known as Radio Atlanta ‚Äì was founded in May 1992 by Ed Hula. The company's global headquarters remains in Atlanta, with contributors and sales staff around the world. Over the years, ATR has become known as ‚Äúthe go-to source for Olympic bid information‚Äù and is frequently quoted across all international media. A subscription to the site is required in order to access premium content, although many articles and features are open to all visitors. Around the Rings delivers news across every distribution platform: print, online, email, and mobile app.  History  Beginning in 1992, Ed Hula formed Radio Atlanta to provide radio networks in the U.S. with reporting about the 1996 Olympics. Hula has provided coverage about every Olympics since Barcelona. From 1994 to 1996, he was the Olympics correspondent for WGST, the official ‚Äúinformation station‚Äù for the Atlanta Games. From 1998 to 2001 he was based in Sydney as the Olympics editor for Radio 2UE, the rights-holding radio station for the 2000 Olympic Games. Even in the mid-1990s, Hula was in the vanguard of new media, when he served as AOL‚Äôs Olympics reporter in Atlanta. While delivering his radio coverage to clients worldwide, Hula realized there was a need for specialized business news about the Olympics . In the mid-1990s, he was asked to write a column for a weekly political newsletter that was mailed out across the Southeast. ‚ÄúThe Hula Report‚Äù, as it was known, soon outgrew its one-page space allotment and became its own four- to eight-page fax distributed twice monthly. By 1998 electronic technology and delivery platforms were becoming increasingly important. ATR's website, launched in late 1996, was already becoming a powerful point of delivery. As the fax expanded to 12 to 16 pages, it became necessary to convert the publication to an email format ‚Äì and to open an office in Sydney, Australia, to cover the Games of 2000. Sydney was a watershed for Around the Rings. It also resulted in phenomenal growth for their readership as well as the range of their publications. The Nagano Olympics in 1998 were a milestone for Around the Rings and the Olympics when Ed Hula became the first New Media journalist accredited for the Games.http://aroundtherings.com/public/EdHula_1st_Accredited_E-Pass.gif Events During that time, Around the Rings developed an events arm with its Newsmaker Breakfast series. These networking events provide the opportunity for journalists, sports marketers and others with an interest in the Games to meet and talk in an informal setting. Guests have included Jacques Rogge, then president of the European Olympic Committees, Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki of Athens 2004, Prince Albert of Monaco, U. S. Olympic Committee presidents, Dmitry Chernyshenko of Sochi 2014, athletics great Sergey Bubka, NBC Olympics chief Dick Ebersol and many other well-known figures in the Olympic Movement. Newsmaker Breakfasts have become an international event, having been hosted in Acapulco, Atlanta, Beijing, Chicago, Copenhagen, London, New York, Salt Lake City, Sydney, and Vancouver. In 2012, the website celebrated its 20th anniversary cementing its claim \\"20 years at #1.\\" Expansion to football In June 2009 Around the Rings created a second internet publication, World Football Insider (WFI). The company launched Insider after realizing the need for a reputable publication about the business of international football. Insider is the first online publication to focus on the business of football. Since its inception, correspondents have reported from Zurich, South Africa, Kuala Lumpur, Moscow, Rio de Janeiro, Nassau and many other locations to provide on-the scene reporting of major football events. It is a primary source of news about preparations for the FIFA World Cup and delivers information about FIFA, its 208 member associations, the business of the six continental confederations, as well as the sponsors of the Beautiful Game. Publications ATR publishes high-impact magazines for major events on the Olympic calendar. These magazines are distributed at the events, typically at the conference site and in hotels and press centers. ATR Daily Editions: The Daily Editions, published during the Olympic Games, target high level visitors and media with information directed at those in the host city. The issues are distributed in the Olympic City at locations such as the Main Press Center, the International Broadcast Center, official hotels, business centers, non- accredited media centers and more. The Ultimate Insider's Guide: This is a pocket-sized compilation of names, contact information, facts, figures and fun designed for high level Games-time visitors and media in the Olympic city. It is also available free of charge online. ATR SportAccord Special Edition: The magazine targets attendees of the SportAccord Convention, the marquee annual conference for the international sports federations. Around the Rings is one of three original media partners since 2005. ATR Golden 25: The Around the Rings Golden 25 is a ranking of the personalities who will have the greatest influence in the Olympics in the coming year. It is one of the most coveted nominations in world sport. The countdown begins mid-December and ends around January 1. The 2011 edition was the 15th anniversary of the Golden 25.

He was posthumously promoted to major general. Biography Oka was a native of Wakayama Prefecture and a graduate of the 24th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1912. As a lieutenant, he served in the IJA 7th Infantry Regiment, followed by the IJA 77th Infantry Regiment. In 1924, he received specialized training in armored warfare, but remained in the infantry all of his career. He was promoted to major in 1930, lieutenant colonel in 1935 and colonel in March 1939. In June 1939, Oka became commander of the 4th sector of the 8th Border Patrol Force under the Kwantung Army guarding the Manchukuo border against the Soviet Union. In June 1940, he was assigned command of the IJA 124th Infantry Regiment, which participated in combat operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War. He was then scouted by General Kiyotake Kawaguchi for the proposed invasion of Port Moresby in New Guinea and reassigned to the southwest Pacific front in 1942, landing on Guadalcanal together with the forces commanded by Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki. Oka commanded a portion of Japanese troops from the 35th Infantry Brigade in a losing effort during the Battle of Edson's Ridge in September, 1942. He later successfully defended the Matanikau River area during the September, 1942 Matanikau action. During the Battle for Henderson Field, he led the 1,200 troops of the 124th Infantry Regiment across the Matanikau and attacked U.S. Marine defenses early on October 26, 1942, but his attack was thrown back with heavy losses to his men, contributing to the overall decisive Japanese defeat in this battle. At the Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse in January 1943, Oka and the 1st and 3rd Battalions from the 124th unsuccessfully attempted to defend a terrain feature called the Sea Horse from American attacks. After losing possession of the feature and surrounding areas, Oka and his surviving troops escaped to friendly lines. Japanese records indicate that he was killed soon after this, but some sources suggest he may have been evacuated with the rest of the Japanese forces during Operation Ke and survived the campaign. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of major general.

Leventis (Nigeria) Plc, in West Africa. A dominant figure in the economy of many West African countries and especially Nigeria, he was awarded the title of Babalaje of Egbaland by Alake Ladapo Ademola. The Egba Scholarship Scheme popularly known as \\"A.G. Leventis (Egba) Scholarship Scheme\\" which award study funds to both undergraduate and postgraduate students of Abeokuta and Egbaland, in general, was coined after his name and it still exists till date. His daughter Fotini married politician Tassos Papadopoulos, who eventually became President of Cyprus. Early life Leventis was born in the village of Lemythou, Limassol District, in the Troodos Mountains. His father was a minister of the Greek Orthodox Church and was also a schoolmaster. Leventis attended Mitsis Commercial School. At the age of 16, he traveled to France to look for employment and educational opportunities. In 1920, he took up a job opportunity in Nigeria working at a trading post in Nwaniba, Akwa Ibom State. Career In 1922, Leventis joined the firm of A.J. Tangalakis in Abeokuta, Ogun State. He developed most of his connections with Nigeria while working in the city. When his firm merged with G.B. Ollivant, Leventis stayed with the amalgamated entity and rose to become the general manager of G. B. Ollivant in Ghana. In 1937, he left the firm after it was acquired by United Africa Company. Leventis then formed his own company and started out as a produce buyer, partly financed by some British cotton manufacturers. He was assisted in the new venture by his brother C.P. Leventis, who organized the Nigerian branch in 1942 and a friend, G.E. Keralakis. In Ghana, Leventis was sympathetic to the cause of African nationalists. He was a friend of Kwame Nkrumah and J.B. Danquah. When a riot flared up in the country, many foreign stores were burnt and closed but only Leventis owned stores remained untouched and were opened throughout the period of conflict. He was made a Ghanaian ambassador to France when Nkrumah was elected president of Ghana. A.G. Leventis established a branch in Nigeria, called A.G. Leventis Nigeria Plc. Within a few years, the Nigerian company expanded its business line from cotton exports to merchandise trading and secured new sources of supplies. In the late 1940s, motivated by diversification and modernization the firm changed its strategy. In 1960, Leventis Group speedily completed the Federal Palace Hotel at the request of the Nigerian government, the hotel served as accommodation for guests expected during Nigeria's independence celebration. By the 1960s his firm had grown to become one of the largest distributors in Nigeria and one of the largest merchandise traders in the West African region. In Nigeria, he restructured the business from general trading into a specialized trading firm and established various department stores. During this period, he thrived as a result of the nation's relatively open economy, as it was not until the 1970s that economic nationalism became a dominant initiative. His marketing style made the Leventis name familiar to many customers in Nigeria. Apart from his sympathy for the nationalist movement in Africa, he also gave his support to his native country's independence movement. He developed a friendship with Arch-Bishop Makarios III who appointed him Cyprus' ambassador to UNESCO and awarded him the medal of St. Barnabas. Philanthropy After his death in 1978, the A.G. Leventis Foundation was established in 1979. It has a primary focus on the cultural heritage of Cyprus and Greece, especially reflected in its collections of Cypriot antiquities displayed in several museums around the world, its restoration of cultural monuments, and its sponsorship of scholarships for postgraduate work in several fields including archaeology and agriculture. The foundation also sponsors work in the areas of environmental protection and medical research. In 1987 the A.G. Leventis Gallery was opened in the British Museum, to display Cypriot antiquities from the early Bronze Age to the Roman era. In 1997, a similar display was opened at the Fitzwilliam Museum, and in 2000 another at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. In 2008 the A.G. Leventis Foundation endowed a new chair at Cambridge University in Greek culture, and in 2017 the Foundation endowed a chair in Greek culture at the University of Dublin ‚Äî the A. G. Leventis Professor of Greek Culture. Private life The earliest records of his family go back to the 18th Century when a young ancestor had traveled to the Peloponnese to join the abortive 1770 uprising against Ottoman rule (known to history as the ‚ÄòOrlov‚Äô rebellion). By the time of his birth, his family counted a number of distinguished clerics who served at the highest levels ‚Äî metropolitan bishops, patriarchs from the Orthodox churches of Jerusalem and Antioch, as well as from the Church of Cyprus. Born in December 1902 in Lemythou, Cyprus to Neoklis/Papaneoklis Leventis and Salome Theocharides, he had several brothers and sisters: Costas; George, who first went to Egypt; Kalliopi who married Alkiviades David, grandmother of film producer Alki David]mother Of Claire Seraphim,Andrew David,Salome Economides, George David,Anastasia David]; Evagoras; Katerina, who wed Mr. Myrianthousis; Charalambos; Anastasios; Christodoulos. He married Fofi.He had a child,Fotini Papadopoulos Leventis.He had four grand children. Constantinos Yiorkadjis (Mayor of Nicosia).Maria Yiorkadji, Nicolas Papadopoulos (Member of the Cypriot Parliament),Anastasia Papadopoulou. He is also uncle to Constantine (Dino) Leventis (1938‚Äì2002), businessman and major art benefactor of Hellenic art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other museums around the world: in April 2000, the Metropolitan Museum opened the A.G. Leventis Foundation Gallery where the museum's collection of Cypriot sculpture, terracottas, vases, jewelry and coins from the fifth and fourth centuries BC are displayed. The foundation also helped pay for similar galleries devoted to ancient Greek and Cypriot art in the British Museum, the Louvre in Paris and the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge University, among others, according to its latest annual report. In Greece, it has financed extensive archeological work.

Fanelli's Arethusa seems to have been replaced with a classicising Diana. He received a pension in 1635 as \\"sculptor of the King\\".

Jurisdiction  Coroners have jurisdiction over the remains of a person and the power to make findings in respect of the cause of death of a person. When a serious criminal offence has been disclosed during the course of an inquest, the Coroner may adjourn the proceedings until the criminal proceedings are concluded. Coroners may also hold inquests concerning the cause of any fire in Victoria, unlike their English counterparts. Generally there are no appeals from the decision of a coroner, although there is provision for the Supreme Court of Victoria to order an inquest or to grant prerogative relief in respect of the proceedings. The State Coroner may also in some circumstances order the re-opening of an inquest.  History  The office of coroner in Victoria derives from the legal framework inherited from the United Kingdom. The first Governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip, was a coroner by virtue of his commission as governor. The governor's commission entitled him to appoint coroners for the Colony of New South Wales, and this was most likely to have been to justices of the peace. Until the District of Port Phillip became the Colony of Victoria and separated from New South Wales in 1851, coroners would have been appointed under the authority of the New South Wales law. The first coroner of Melbourne and the county of Bourke was Dr William Byam Wilmot MD. He was appointed by the then Superintendent of Port Phillip, but later Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony of Victoria, Charles La Trobe, in 1841. The second city coroner, appointed in 1857, was Dr Richard Youl MD, while the third city coroner, appointed at the death of Youl in 1897 was Mr Samuel Curtis Candler. The first temporary morgue in Melbourne was erected on the corner of Flinders Street and Swanston Street in 1871, while the first permanent coroner's courthouse was constructed alongside the Yarra River in 1888. The courthouse building was demolished in 1959.  Structure and jurisdiction  The Governor of Victoria may appoint a State Coroner for Victoria.section 6, Coroners Act 1985 The State Coroner has the function to oversee and co-ordinate coronial services in Victoria, ensure that all deaths, suspected deaths and fires concerning which a coroner has jurisdiction to hold an inquest are properly investigated, ensuring that an inquest is held whenever it is required, and to issue guidelines to coroners to assist them in the exercise or performance of their functions. The Governor may also appoint Deputy State Coroners. Deputy State Coroners may exercise any of the functions of the State Coroner delegated by the State Coroner to them. Both must be either a County Court of Victoria judge, a magistrate, or a lawyer. The Governor may also appoint Coroners. The Governor may also appoint a magistrate as a coroner. Unlike in other Australian states, all magistrates in Victoria do not automatically become coroners by virtue of their appointment as a magistrate.section 8, Coroners Act 1985  References  Sources  *Homepage of the court ‚Äì http://www.coronerscourt.vic.gov.au *Coroners Act 1985 (Vic) ‚Äì http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca1985120/ Category:Victoria (Australia) courts and tribunals Victoria ","title":"Coroners Court of Victoria"},{"id":"10134453","text":"Robert Julien Mongrain (born August 31, 1959 in La Sarre, Quebec) is a former professional ice hockey centre.

History The Nihongo daijiten was one of three Japanese dictionaries specifically published to compete with Iwanami's bestselling K≈çjien (1955, 1969, 1983). The others were Sanseid≈ç's Daijirin (1988, 1995, 2006) and Shogakukan's Daijisen (1995, 1998). These four general-purpose kokugo jisho (ÂõΩË™ûËæûÊõ∏ \\"Japanese language dictionaries\\") are bulky reference works that weigh approximately 1 kilogram. Along with the chief editor Umesao Tadao, other Nihongo daijiten editors included Kindaichi Haruhiko (ÈáëÁî∞‰∏ÄÊò•ÂΩ¶, 1913‚Äì2004), Sakakura Atsuyoshi (Èò™ÂÄâÁØ§Áæ©, 1917‚Äì1994), and Hinohara Shigeaki (Êó•ÈáéÂéüÈáçÊòé, 1911- ). Kodansha's first Color- edition Nihongo daijiten (1989) included over 175,000 headword entries. This dictionary also incorporated encyclopedic content such as color pictures, proper names, allegedly \\"10,000\\" kanji entries (many with Japanese input method JIS X 0208 codes), and some 100,000 English translation glosses for modern Japanese words. The 2nd edition (1995) expanded by almost 250 pages, giving 200,000 headwords, 120,000 English glosses, and 6500 color illustrations. The printed Nihongo daijiten version came with an electronic book CD-ROM containing some additional digital content (graphic data, sound files, etc.). In 2001, Sony licensed Kodansha's Nihongo daijiten and released a Japanese TVware version for PlayStation 2. Characteristics English glosses are one of the most notable differences between the Nihongo daijiten and other general-purpose Japanese dictionaries (K≈çjien, Daijirin, Daijisen, etc.). Since the Nihongo daijiten gives brief English annotations rather than translation equivalents, it is not an actual Japanese-English bilingual dictionary, but it is useful as an all-in-one dictionary. Most monolingual Japanese dictionaries only include English words as loanword sources, for instance, noting tie as the origin of Japanese tai („Çø„Ç§ \\"tie, necktie; tie, equal score\\"). In distinction, the Nihongo daijiten entry for tai (ÈØõ \\"sea bream; porgy\\") gives three English glosses. *porgy, under the fish name *supreme thing, under the \\"highest quality\\" metaphor, specifically the idiom kusatte mo tai (ËÖê„Å£„Å¶„ÇÇÈØõ \\"Even if it's rotting, sea bream [is the best]\\") *Better to be the head of a dog than the tail of a lion, under the subentry for tai no o yorimo iwashi no kashira (ÈØõ„ÅÆÂ∞æ„Çà„Çä„ÇÇÈ∞Ø„ÅÆÈ†≠ \\"Better to be the head of a sardine than the tail of a sea bream\\"). English is also prominent on the Nihongo daijiten cover with a stylized \\"GJ\\" monogram and \\"The Great Japanese Dictionary\\" title. While the venerable K≈çjien dictionary only had black-and-white illustrations, the three competitors took advantage of color printing technology. For instance, all included appendices showing Japanese color names and corresponding colors. First, the Nihongo Daijiten (1989) appendix printed 350 colors and names (Ëâ≤ÂêçËæûÂÖ∏ \\"Dictionary of color names\\", with notes and page cross- references). Second, the Daijisen (1995) appendix had 358 („Ç´„É©„Éº„ÉÅ„É£„Éº„ÉàËâ≤Âêç \\"Color chart of color names\\"). The 1st edition Daijirin (1988) was printed in two colors, and the 2nd edition (1995) added a color appendix displaying 168 (Ëâ≤„ÅÆÂêç \\"Names of colors\\", some with Classical Japanese quotations). Reviews The Japanese translator Tom Gally (1999) criticizes the Nihongo Daijiten in comparison with the K≈çjien, Daijirin, and Daijisen. > Though subtitled in English \\"The Great Japanese Dictionary,\\" this dictionary > is, in my opinion, the least great of the four large single-volume kokugo > dictionaries described here.

It is a court which has exclusive jurisdiction over the remains of a person and the power to make findings in respect of the cause of death of a person, a fire or an explosion in Tasmania. History The office of coroner in Tasmania derives from the legal framework inherited from the United Kingdom. The first Governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip, was a coroner by virtue of his commission as governor. Similarly, Lieutenant Governors of Van Diemen's Land, which subsequently became the state of Tasmania, also had similar powers. The lieutenant governor's commission also entitled him to appoint others as coroners as required, and this was most likely to have been to justices of the peace. Structure and Jurisdiction Coroners have the power to investigate the causes of death within their jurisdiction. They also have power to retain a person‚Äôs remain, order autopsies, and direct how a person‚Äôs remains may be disposed of. In Tasmania, they have jurisdiction over fires and explosions, a function which coroners in the United Kingdom did not have. Where a serious criminal offence has been disclosed during the course of an inquest or an inquiry, the Coroner may refer that matter to the Attorney-General of Tasmania for consideration of the institution of criminal proceedings. Generally there are no appeals from the decision of a coroner, although there may be provision for the Supreme Court of Tasmania of the Chief Magistrate of Tasmania to reopen an inquest or inquiry.sections 59 & 59A, Coroners Act 1995 There may also be power for the Supreme Court of Tasmania to grant prerogative relief in respect of the proceedings. State Coroner Unlike other states in Australia, there is no specific requirement in Tasmania law to appoint a State Coroner. In Tasmania, the Chief Magistrate performs those functions. The Chief Magistrate has the function to oversee and co-ordinate coronial services in Tasmania, ensure that all deaths and suspected deaths concerning which a coroner has jurisdiction to hold an inquest are properly investigated, and ensuring that an inquest is held whenever it is required, and to issue guidelines to coroners to assist them in the exercise or performance of their functions.section 7, Coroners Act 1995 The Governor may also appoint Coroners. All magistrates in Tasmania are coroners by virtue of their appointment as a magistrate. The secretary of the Department of Justice may appoint a public servant to be a Chief Clerk or Coroner‚Äôs Associate. Every police officer in Tasmania is a coroner‚Äôs officer.

He met Picasso, Braque and members of the surrealist group.\\"Alain Cuny\\", Cin√©-Ressources; retrieved 22 January 2016. He then began working in the film industry as a costume, poster and set designer and was employed on films of Cavalcanti, Feyder and Renoir. After a meeting with the actor-manager Charles Dullin, Cuny was persuaded to study drama and he began acting on stage in the late 1930s.Ephraim Katz. The International Film Encyclopedia. London: Macmillan, 1980. p. 292. In the theatre, Cuny became particularly linked with the works of Paul Claudel (who said of him after a performance of L'Annonce faite √† Marie in 1944, \\"I have been waiting for you 20 years\\").James Kirkup. \\"Obituary: Alain Cuny\\", in The Independent, 18 May 1994.

(Paris: Larousse, 1987). p. 97. His first major role in the cinema was as one of the devil's envoys in Marcel Carn√©'s film Les Visiteurs du soir (1942). A few other romantic leading parts followed, but increasingly he appeared in supporting roles, especially in characterizations of intellectuals such as the tormented philosopher Steiner in La Dolce Vita (1960), directed by Federico Fellini. He worked frequently in Italian cinema and had close associations with Michelangelo Antonioni and Francesco Rosi as well as Fellini. One of his most admired film performances was in Rosi's Uomini contro (Many Wars Ago, 1970), as the rigidly authoritarian General Leone. Among his French films were The Lovers (Les Amants, 1958), directed by Louis Malle, and Jean-Luc Godard's D√©tective (1985). He also appeared in the softcore porn film Emmanuelle (1974), a role which he said he took to show his contempt for the film business.Olivier Germain-Thomas: Agora:\\"les aventuriers de l'esprit\\". Besan√ßon: La Manufacture, 1991. p. 209: \\"J'ai jou√© dans Emmanuelle pour me d√©barrasser de l'estime des gens que je n'estimais pas.\\" In the same year, he played Sitting Bull in the absurdist western Ne touchez pas √† la femme blanche! (Don't Touch the White Woman!, 1974). Towards the end of his career he returned to aspects of Claudel. He appeared in Camille Claudel (1988), a biographical film about the author's sister in which he played their father, Louis-Prosper Claudel. In 1991 he completed a long-planned film adaptation of a Claudel play The Annunciation of Marie (L'Annonce faite √† Marie, 1991), a French-Canadian production in which he both directed and acted; it won him the Prix Georges- Sadoul. He also gave regular readings of Claudel's work at the Festival d'Avignon. Cuny died in 1994 in Paris. He is buried in Civry-la-For√™t, west of Paris, where he had lived.

In the Court of Appeal, Atkin LJ delivered an important dissenting judgment which was upheld by the House of Lords. The case also is an example of the application of the Blue Pencil Rule. Facts Rose and Frank Co was the sole US distributor of JR Crompton's carbon paper products. In 1913, the parties signed a new document which included this clause: The relationship between the two parties broke down as JR Crompton refused to supply some of the orders of the plaintiff. Rose & Frank Co sued on enforcement of the agreement. Judgment At first instance, the court held that the honourable pledge was repugnant to the intention of the rest of the document, and that furthermore the enforceability of such a clause was contrary to public policy. In his decision, Bailhache J. reasoned that the impugned clause was of no effect and that the document was a legally binding contract and enforceable in the court.http://law.anu.edu.au/colin/Lectures/intent.htm Court of Appeal Scrutton LJ stated that parties are capable of forming an agreement that does not give rise to legal relations. \\"The reason of this is that the parties do not intend that their agreement shall give rise to legal relations. This intention may be implied from the subject matter of the agreement, but it may also be expressed by the parties. In social and family relations such an intention is readily implied, while in business matters the opposite result would ordinarily follow.\\" Atkin LJ agreed that there was no contract but dissented on the order.

Jasper Avenue has no official street number but is aligned with 101 Avenue with the majority of its length. Jasper Avenue is a major public transit route as several of Edmonton's busiest bus routes travel along it. The LRT travels underneath Jasper Avenue between 99 and 110 Streets. It is named after Jasper Hawes, manager of a North West Company trading post of Jasper House in the early 1800s, located in present-day Jasper National Park.  Route description  Jasper Avenue begins at 125 Street in the community of Westmount as a local residential street. One block to the east, 124 Street turns east and becomes Jasper Avenue, which functions as its unofficial western terminus, with 102 Avenue taking over as the main east-west artery to west Edmonton. Jasper Avenue passes the community of Oliver through mixed retail and high density residential. East of 109 Street, Jasper Avenue passes through the downtown core and is home to many of Edmonton's oldest heritage buildings (for example the Hotel Macdonald) and some of Edmonton's tallest office towers, including Canadian Western Bank Place and Scotia Place. East of 97 Street, Jasper Avenue departs from both the downtown core and the 101 Avenue alignment, running northeast along the North Saskatchewan River valley through the community of Boyle Street. At 82 Street, the roadway turns north; however Jasper Avenue continues east as a local residential street through the community of Cromdale, ending at 77 Street. The Jasper West area (west of 97 Street) is one of the major retail, living, commercial, and entertainment districts of the city. History Jasper Avenue looking west from 103 Street (1950). Jasper Avenue first emerged as a commercial main street in the 1870s and 1880s, with the Jasper Avenue emerging of Edmonton's downtown main street in the early 1900s. In 1912, the Cities of Edmonton and Strathcona amalgamated, leaving Edmonton with two main streets ‚Äì Jasper Avenue to the north, and Whyte Avenue to the south. Jasper Avenue continued to gain strength as a commercial centre through the 1930s and 40s, supporting streetcars as well as motorized vehicles, with the 101 Street intersection receiving Edmonton‚Äôs first traffic light in 1933. The years following World War II saw unprecedented growth, with the oil discovery near Leduc in 1948 and the strategic positioning of Edmonton as a base for subsequent major oil construction projects. Growth continued in the 1960s with intensification of the downtown core, and in the 1970s a number of historical buildings were demolished in order to accommodate large towers and future growth. Jasper Avenue began to decline in the 1980s with the rise of indoor shopping malls, in particular West Edmonton Mall which supplanted Jasper Avenue as Edmonton's main shopping district. The mid-1980s saw the beginning of reinvestment in the downtown core and Jasper Avenue which included the underground LRT in 1985 and the subsequent redesign of the Jasper Avenue streetscape; however, at the same time Whyte Avenue emerged and subsequently supplanted Jasper Avenue as Edmonton's main entertainment district. While slow reinvestment continued into the 2000s, the downtown core has recently seen increased development, such as the rise of the Warehouse District and Ice District to the north, resulting in increased activity and redevelopment along Jasper Avenue. The original alignment of Highway 16 which entered Edmonton from the west along Stony Plain Road and 102 Avenue, followed Jasper Avenue between 124 Street and 95 Street, where it connected with Rowland Road and the Dawson Bridge, left Edmonton to the east along 101 Avenue. In the 1950s, Highway 16 was moved to 111 Avenue and 118 Avenue, resulting in the inner city route becoming Highway 16A. In the early 1980s, the Highway 16A designation along Jasper Avenue was phased out. Looking east along Jasper Avenue. Looking west along Jasper Avenue from 101 Street (2007).

Synopsis A beautiful young girl was made to work hard by her wicked stepmother. One day, the stepmother set her to pick twelve pounds of feathers before night and promised a beating if she failed. The girl cried. An old woman asked about her troubles; she told them, and the old woman promised all would be well and told her to lie down. The girl slept, and the old woman picked the feathers. The next day, the stepmother set her to empty a pond with a spoon. The old woman had her sleep in a thicket and touched the pool with the spoon, which turned the pool to vapor. The third day, the stepmother ordered her to build a castle in a rocky valley. The old woman had her sleep in the shade and moved the rocks to form a castle. The stepmother inspected every inch of it, promising a beating if it were not all as it should be; she went to check that the cellar was filled, and the cellar door fell on her, killing her. The girl lived in the castle alone. It was filled with riches, and stories of her beauty and wealth spread. Many wooers came to her. At last, a king's son won her heart. He went to get his father's consent. She kissed him, told him not to let anyone else kiss him on that cheek, and sat under a lime tree to await him. On the fourth day without his return, she packed up three dresses, embroidered with suns, moons, and stars, and set out to seek him. She was unable to find him, whoever she asked, and finally took a job as a cowherd and buried her jewels and dresses under a rock. She made a pet of a little calf and sang to it of her being abandoned. After a few years, she heard that the king's daughter was to marry, and saw that the bridegroom was her prince. She sang to her calf as the prince rode by, and he looked at her, but he did not remember her. When three days' festivities were held to celebrate the marriage, she dressed herself in her gown with suns and went to the first ball. She so enchanted the prince that he forgot his new bride. The second night, she wore the gown with moons and enchanted him again; she had to promise to come the third night to get away. The third night, she wore the gown with stars, and when she kissed him, he remembered her. They went back to her castle and married there.

Apparatus Whereas still rings are now 9.8 feet from the point of attachment, flying rings ‚Äì also used as still rings in the past ‚Äì were on cables up to 22 feet in length - the extra 12 feet allowing the gymnast to swing through an impressive arc. The rings themselves were at times larger and heavier than competition still rings today, designed on a steel core covered by rubber or leather. History There is some evidence that the event took place in an international contest in the late 1800s, if not earlier. Records from Princeton University indicate one of its students, H. G. Otis, won the Eastern Intercollegiate Championships in flying rings in 1902. In America, the event persisted on a regular basis in both NCAA and AAU gymnastic competitions until the early 1960s, when those governing bodies eliminated the flying rings in future meets in an effort to correlate apparatus and performances with those in the modern Olympic Games. Another reason flying rings was removed from intercollegiate competitions is the dangerous nature of the event, with the gymnast soaring to a height of 15 feet or so at each end of a swing. Frank Snay, of Navy, was the last winner in the NCAA event in 1961. It is difficult to ascertain if flying rings ever existed in the Olympic Games, for records occasionally cite medalists in \\"flying rings\\" when in fact the event may have been the still rings. The Performance To start a routine, the gymnast jumped or was lifted until he could grasp the rings; then an assistant pulled or pushed him, starting his swing. At the end of each arc the gymnast would do pikes, dislocates or front or back-uprises to build up height. A typical routine would show a number of \\"flying\\" dislocates or inlocates (a dislocate leading directly to a support above the rings or a [shoulder stand. Advanced performers would do two tricks at each end of the swing. Such as a \\"dislocate\\" to a \\"shoot the shoulder\\" move done in the front or the back of the swing. The performer might also do additional moves typical of the still rings while in flight, . After several passes the routine would end with a (usually) spectacular dismount, normally off a front swing The winning dismount at the AAU held at the Air Force Academy in 1960 was at the front of the swing, a front dislocate immediately into a double flyaway from 15 feetJeppesen.

Isolated fortresses remained in Byzantine hands until 965, but the island was henceforth under Muslim rule until conquered in turn by the Normans in the 11th century. Although Sicily had been raided by the Muslims since the mid-7th century, these raids did not threaten Byzantine control over the island, which remained a largely peaceful backwater. The opportunity for the Aghlabid emirs of Ifriqiya came in 827, when the commander of the island's fleet, Euphemius, rose in revolt against the Byzantine Emperor Michael II. Defeated by loyalist forces and driven from the island, Euphemius sought the aid of the Aghlabids. The latter regarded this as an opportunity for expansion and for diverting the energies of their own fractious military establishment and alleviating the criticism of the Islamic scholars by championing jihad, and dispatched an army to aid him. Following the Arab landing on the island, Euphemius was quickly sidelined. An initial assault on the island's capital, Syracuse, failed, but the Muslims were able to weather the subsequent Byzantine counter-attack and hold on to a few fortresses. With the aid of reinforcements from Ifriqiya and al-Andalus, in 831 they took Palermo, which became the capital of the new Muslim province. The Byzantine government sent a few expeditions to aid the locals against the Muslims, but preoccupied with the struggle against the Abbasids on their eastern frontier and with the Cretan Saracens in the Aegean Sea, it was unable to mount a sustained effort to drive back the Muslims, who over the next three decades raided Byzantine possessions almost unopposed. The strong fortress of Enna in the centre of the island was the main Byzantine bulwark against Muslim expansion, until its capture in 859. Following its fall, the Muslims increased their pressure against the eastern parts of the island, and, after a long siege, captured Syracuse in 878. The Byzantines retained control of some fortresses in the north-eastern corner of the island for some decades thereafter, and launched a number of efforts to recover the island until well into the 11th century, but were unable to seriously challenge Muslim control over Sicily. The fall of the last major Byzantine fortress, Taormina, in 902, is held to mark the completion of the Muslim conquest of Sicily. Under Muslim rule, Sicily prospered and eventually detached itself from Ifriqiya to form a semi-independent emirate. The island's Muslim community survived the Norman conquest in the 1060s and even prospered under the Norman kings, giving birth to a unique cultural mix, until it was deported to Lucera in the 1220s after a failed uprising. Background Throughout the imperial Roman period, Sicily was a quiet, prosperous backwater. Only in the 5th century did it suffer from raids by the Vandals operating from the coasts of North Africa. In 535, the island came under Byzantine control and was raided by the Ostrogoths in the Gothic War, but calm returned thereafter. Protected by the sea, the island was spared the ravages inflicted on Byzantine Italy through the Lombard invasions of the late 6th and early 7th centuries, and retained a still flourishing urban life and a civilian administration. It was only the increasing threat of the Muslim expansion that thrust it into the limelight. As John Bagnell Bury writes, \\"A fruitful land and a desirable possession in itself, Sicily's central position between the two basins of the Mediterranean rendered it an object of supreme importance to any Eastern sea-power which was commercially or politically aggressive; while for an ambitious ruler in Africa it was the steppingstone to Italy and the gates of the Adriatic.\\" Consequently, the island was early on targeted by the Muslims, the first raid occurring in 652, only a few years after the establishment of the first Muslim navy. Following the onset of Muslim attacks against North Africa, it became a crucial strategic base, and for a while, in 661‚Äì668, it was the residence of the imperial court under Constans II. Constituted as a theme around 690, its governing strategos also came to assume control over the scattered imperial possessions in the southern Italian mainland. The island was raided thereafter, especially in the first half of the 8th century, but did not come under serious threat until the Muslims completed their conquest of North Africa and moved into Hispania as well. It was Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri, the Abbasid governor of Ifriqiya, who first made plans to invade the island in force and attempt to capture it and Sardinia in 752‚Äì753, but he was thwarted by a Berber rebellion. In 799, the founder of the Aghlabid dynasty, Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab, secured recognition of his position as autonomous emir of Ifriqiya by the Abbasid caliph, Harun al- Rashid, thereby marking the establishment of a practically independent state centred on modern Tunisia. In 805, Ibrahim concluded a ten-year truce with the Byzantine governor of Sicily, which was renewed by Ibrahim's son and successor Abdallah I in 813. During this time, the Aghlabids were too preoccupied with their rivalry with the Idrisids to the west to plan any serious assault on Sicily. Instead, there are testimonies of commercial traffic between Sicily and Ifriqiya, and of the presence of Arab traders on the island. Euphemius' rebellion Europe and the Mediterranean on the eve of the Muslim invasion of Sicily. The occasion for the invasion of Sicily was provided by the rebellion of the tourmarches Euphemius, commander of the island's fleet. According to later and possibly fictional accounts, driven by lust for a nun, he had forced her to marry him. Her brothers protested to Emperor Michael II, and the Byzantine ruler ordered the island's strategos, Constantine Soudas, to investigate the matter and if the charges were found true, to cut off Euphemius' nose as punishment. Thus it came that Euphemius, returning from a naval raid against the African coast, learned that he was to be arrested. Instead, he sailed for Syracuse, occupying the city, while the governor sought refuge in the interior. Euphemius soon managed to gain the support of a large part of the island's military leadership. Euphemius repulsed an attempt by Constantine to recover Syracuse, forcing the governor to flee to Catana. Euphemius' forces pursued and drove Constantine out of Catana, and eventually captured and executed him. Euphemius was then proclaimed emperor. The historian Alexander Vasiliev doubts the \\"romantic\\" story of the origin of Euphemius' revolt, and believes that the ambitious general simply used an opportune moment, when the central Byzantine government was weakened by the recent Revolt of Thomas the Slav, and by its preoccupation with the contemporary Muslim conquest of Crete, to seize power for himself. At this point, however, Euphemius was deserted by one of his closest and most powerful allies, a man known through Arab sources as \\"Balata\\" (according to Vasiliev probably a corruption of his title, while Treadgold holds that he was named Plato), and his cousin Michael, commander of Palermo. The two men denounced Euphemius' usurpation of the imperial title and marched against Syracuse, defeated Euphemius and took the city. Like one of his predecessors, Elpidius, who had rebelled under Irene of Athens, Euphemius resolved to seek refuge among the Empire's enemies and with a few supporters sailed to Ifriqiya. There he sent a delegation to the Aghlabid court, which pleaded with the Aghlabid emir Ziyadat Allah for an army to help Euphemius conquer Sicily, after which he would pay the Aghlabids an annual tribute. This offer came as a great opportunity for the Aghlabids, who faced long-simmering ethnic tensions between Arab settlers and Berbers, dissension and rebellions within the Arab ruling elite (the jund), and criticism for their preoccupation with worldly concerns, their \\"un-Islamic\\" system of taxation and their luxurious lifestyle from the jurists of the Malikite school. Indeed, at the time of Euphemius' arrival, Ziyadat Allah had just suppressed a dangerous three-year revolt of the jund under Mansur al-Tunbudhi. As Alex Metcalfe writes, \\"by undertaking a jihad to expand the frontiers of Islam at the expense of the infidels by conquest ‚Äì the first major undertaking since the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula from 711 ‚Äì they could silence the criticism of the jurists. At the same time, they could redirect the destructive energies of a restless jund across the Ifriqiyan‚ÄìSicilian channel to secure new sources of manpower and wealth\\". Ziyadat Allah's council was divided over the issue, but in the end the exhortations of the respected qadi of Kairouan, Asad ibn al-Furat, who used quotations from the Quran to support his case, swayed them. Asad was placed at the head of the expedition even while retaining his office of qadi, normally incompatible with a military post. The Muslim expeditionary forces are said to have consisted of ten thousand foot soldiers and seven hundred cavalry, mostly Ifriqiyan Arabs and Berbers, but possibly also some Khurasanis. The fleet comprised seventy or a hundred ships, to which were added Euphemius' own vessels. Initial operations and conquest of Palermo=Muslim landing and siege of Syracuse, 827‚Äì828 On 14 June 827, the allied fleets sailed from the Bay of Sousse, and after three days they reached Mazara in southwestern Sicily, where they landed. There they were met with soldiers loyal to Euphemius, but the alliance soon began to show rifts: a Muslim detachment mistook some of Euphemius' partisans for loyalist troops, and a skirmish ensued. Although Euphemius' troops were ordered to place a twig on their helmets as a distinctive mark, Asad announced his intention to wage the campaign without them. Soon after that, Balata, who seems to have taken over the functions, if not the title, of the imperial strategos on the island, appeared nearby with a Byzantine force. The two armies clashed on a plain south-east of Mazara, where Asad's men, after exhortations by their leader, gained a victory. Balata retreated first to Enna and from there to Calabria on the Italian mainland, where he may have hoped to gather more troops. Instead, he died there shortly after his arrival. Asad then left Mazara under Abu Zaki al-Kinani, and turned to Syracuse: the Muslim army advanced along the southern shore towards the island's capital, but at Qalat al-Qurrat (possibly ancient Acrae), it was met by an embassy from the city which offered tribute if the Muslims halted their advance. The proposal was probably designed to buy time for the city to better prepare itself for a siege, but Asad, either persuaded by the emissaries' assurances or needing to rest his army, halted his advance for a few days. At the same time, Euphemius began to regret his alliance with the Aghlabids, and opened secret contacts with the imperials, urging them to resist the Arabs. The Muslims recommenced their advance soon after, and laid siege to the city. Byzantium, which at the same time was forced to face a threat much closer to home at Crete, was unable to send much aid to the beleaguered island, while the Muslims received reinforcements from Africa. Giustiniano Participazio, the dux of the imperial protectorate of Venice, came to the city's aid, but was not able to raise the siege. The besiegers however suffered from lack of supplies as well as the outbreak of a disease in spring 828, which cost Asad his life. He was replaced by Muhammad ibn Abu'l-Jawari. When a Byzantine fleet arrived, the Arabs raised the siege and tried to sail back to Africa, but were hindered by the Byzantine ships. Thwarted, the Muslim army burned its ships and retreated over land to the castle of Mineo, which surrendered to them after three days. First siege of Enna and the Byzantine counterattack, 828‚Äì829 View of Enna (Castrogiovanni) Despite his contacts with the imperials, Euphemius was now willing to serve as their guide, evidently hoping that the Muslims, humbled by their failure and without the strong will of Asad to guide them, could now be made to serve his purposes. After Mineo surrendered, the Muslim army divided in two: one part took Agrigento in the west, while the other, along with Euphemius, attacked Enna. The garrison of Enna began negotiations, offering to acknowledge Euphemius' authority, but when Euphemius with a small escort met with their emissaries, he was murdered. It is unknown what happened to Euphemius' supporters after his death, whether they dispersed or continued fighting alongside the Muslims. In spring 829, Michael II sent a new fleet to Sicily under Theodotus, who was well acquainted with the island, having already served as its strategos in the past. After landing, Theodotus marched his army to Enna, where the Arabs were continuing the siege. He was defeated in the subsequent battle, but was able to find refuge in the fortress with most of his men. The Muslims now became so confident of victory that they struck their first coins on the island, in the name of Ziyadat Allah and Muhammad ibn Abu'l-Jawari, who however died a short while after and was replaced by Zubayr ibn Gawth. Shortly after that, Theodotus managed to reverse the situation: he led a sally that routed a Muslim raiding party and then defeated the main Muslim army on the next day, killing 1,000 men and pursuing the rest up to the Muslims' fortified encampment, which he placed under siege. The Muslims tried to break out in a night sortie, but Theodotus was expecting such a move and routed them in an ambush. The remains of the Muslim army once again sought refuge in Mineo, where Theodotus blockaded them and soon reduced them to the point of eating their horses and even dogs. When they heard of this reversal, the Arab garrison of Agrigento abandoned the city and retreated to Mazara. Thus, by the autumn of 829, Sicily had almost been cleared of the Muslim invaders. Umayyad assistance and the death of Theodotus, 830 Theodotus' success was not to be completed, however: in early summer 830, a fleet from the Umayyad Emirate of C√≥rdoba in al-Andalus, under Asbagh ibn Wakil, arrived in Sicily. Theodotus did not confront them, hoping that they would depart after raiding, but the beleaguered garrison at Mineo managed to get into contact with the raiders and proposed joint action. The Andalusians agreed, provided that Asbagh was recognized as the overall commander, and together with fresh troops from Ifriqiya marched on Mineo. Unable to confront them, Theodotus retreated to Enna and the siege of Mineo was broken (July or August 830). The combined Ifriqiyan and Andalusian army then torched Mineo and laid siege to another town, possibly Calloniana (modern Barrafranca). However, once again a plague broke out in their camp, killing Asbagh and many others. The town fell later, in autumn, but the Arabs' numbers were so depleted that they had to abandon it and retreat west. Theodotus launched a pursuit and inflicted heavy casualties, so that most of the Andalusians departed the island. However, Theodotus too was killed at this time, possibly in one of these skirmishes.  Fall of Palermo, 831  Meanwhile, the Ifriqiyans of Mazara, together with some of the Andalusians, had advanced across the island and laid siege to Palermo. The city held out for a year until September 831, when its commander, the spatharios Symeon, surrendered it in exchange for safe departure for the city's senior officials and possibly the garrison as well. The city suffered greatly during the siege; the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, records‚Äîprobably with some exaggeration‚Äîthat the city's population fell from 70,000 to 3,000, who were taken as slaves. The city's bishop, Luke, managed to escape and reach Constantinople, where he informed Emperor Theophilos of the disaster. The fall of Palermo marks a decisive step in the Muslim conquest of Sicily: the Muslims gained not only an important military base, but possession of the city‚Äîhenceforth known simply as al-Madina (\\"the City\\")‚Äîallowed them to consolidate their control over the western portion of the island, which was established as a regular Aghlabid province. Thus, in March 832, the first Aghlabid governor (wali), Abu Fihr Muhammad ibn Abdallah, arrived in Palermo. Abu Fihr was a capable man, and was able to assuage the often violent dissensions between Ifriqiyans and Andalusians. Expansion of the Muslim province The western third of Sicily (Val di Mazara) fell relatively quickly into Muslim hands, but conquest of the eastern portion of the island was a protracted and haphazard affair. There is little evidence of large-scale campaigns or pitched battles, and warfare was dominated by repeated Arab attacks on Byzantine citadels, coupled with raids (sa'ifa) in the surrounding countryside, aimed at looting or the extraction of tribute and prisoners from the threatened localities. In this type of warfare, the south-eastern third of the island (Val di Noto) suffered comparatively more than the more mountainous and inaccessible north-eastern portion (Val Demone). Expeditions of 832‚Äì836 No operations are reported in Sicily for the first two years after the fall of Palermo. The Muslims were probably preoccupied with organizing their new province, while the Byzantines were too weak to react, and could not expect any reinforcements: the Empire faced mounting pressure in the East, where the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun launched repeated invasions of the Byzantine borderlands and threatened to march on Constantinople itself until his sudden death in August 833. The struggle during the next few years focused on Enna, which became the main Byzantine stronghold in central Sicily. In early 834, Abu Fihr campaigned against Enna, defeated its garrison in the field and forced it to withdraw within the town's fortifications. In spring, the garrison sallied forth, but was again defeated and driven back. In 835, Abu Fihr again raided central Sicily, and defeated the army under a Byzantine patrikios (probably the island's strategos) that opposed him, taking the Byzantine commander's wife and son captive in the process. After his success, Abu Fihr sent Muhammad ibn Salim in a raid against the eastern parts of the island, which reached as far as Taormina. However, dissensions broke out once again among the Muslims: Abu Fihr was murdered, and his killers found refuge among the Byzantines. The Aghlabids replaced Abu Fihr with al-Fadl ibn Yaqub, who displayed great energy: immediately after his arrival he led a raid against the environs of Syracuse, and then another into central Sicily, around Enna. The Byzantine strategos marched out to meet them, but the Muslims withdrew to a mountainous and thickly forested area where the Byzantines could not pursue. After waiting in vain for the Muslims to accept battle, the strategos turned his army back, but was ambushed by the Muslims who put his men to flight. The Muslims seized most of the Byzantines' arms, equipment and animals, and almost managed to capture the severely wounded strategos himself. Despite his success, Ibn Yaqub was replaced in September by a new governor, the Aghlabid prince Abu'l-Aghlab Ibrahim ibn Abdallah ibn al-Aghlab, a first cousin of the emir Ziyadat Allah. At the same time, the long-awaited Byzantine reinforcements arrived. The Byzantine fleet contested the passage of Abu'l-Aghlab's small fleet, which lost ships both to the Byzantine attack and to storms; the Byzantines however could not prevent it from reaching Palermo, and were driven off by a squadron from the city under Muhammad ibn al-Sindi. Abu'l-Aghlab avenged himself by launching naval raids against Pantelleria and other localities, beheading the Christians taken prisoner. At the same time, a Muslim cavalry raid reached the eastern parts of the island around Mount Etna, burning the villages and crops and taking captives. In 836, Abu'l-Aghlab launched fresh attacks. A Muslim force seized the fortress known in Arabic as Qastaliasali (probably Castelluccio on the island's northern coast), but were driven away by a Byzantine counter-attack. The Muslim fleet, under al-Fadl ibn Yaqub, raided the Aeolian Islands and seized a number of forts on the northern coast of Sicily, most notably Tyndaris. In the meantime, another cavalry raid was dispatched against the region of Etna and was so successful that the price for Byzantine captives plummeted. Expeditions of 837‚Äì841 Emperor Theophilos and his court, from the Madrid Skylitzes In 837, a Muslim army under Abd al-Salam ibn Abd al-Wahhab attacked Enna, but was defeated by the Byzantines, and Abd al-Salam himself was taken prisoner. The Muslims responded by reinforcing their position around Enna, which they placed under siege. During the following winter, one of the besiegers discovered an unguarded path leading to the town, allowing the Muslims to take the entire lower town. The Byzantines however managed to maintain control of the citadel, and, after negotiations, secured a Muslim withdrawal in exchange for a large ransom. Theophilos now undertook a serious effort to relieve Sicily: he assembled a large army and placed it under the command of his son-in-law, the Caesar Alexios Mousele. Mousele arrived in Sicily in spring 838, in time to relieve the fortress of Cefal√π from a Muslim attack. Mousele scored a number of successes against Muslim raiding parties but, back in Constantinople, his enemies launched accusations of contacts with the Arabs and designs on the throne. Furthermore, the death of his infant wife, Maria, cut his link to Theophilos, and the Emperor sent the archbishop of Syracuse, Theodore Krithinos, to recall the Caesar to Constantinople in 839. On 11 June 838 the emir Ziyadat Allah died, and was succeeded by his brother, Abu Iqal al-Aghlab. The new emir sent fresh troops to Sicily, where the Muslims regained the upper hand after Mousele's departure: in 839‚Äì840, the Muslims captured the fortresses of Corleone, Platani, Caltabellotta, and possibly also Marineo, Geraci and other forts, and in 841, they raided from Enna as far as Grotte. In the same period, the Sicilian Muslims also established footholds in the Italian mainland. The Muslims were asked to assist the beleaguered Duchy of Naples against Sicard of Benevento in 839, but then they sacked Brindisi and, following Sicard's murder and the outbreak of civil war in the Principality of Benevento, seized Tarentum in 840 and Bari in 847, which they made their bases. Until well into the 880s, the Muslims would launch destructive raids along the coasts of Italy and into the Adriatic Sea from their bases on the Italian mainland ‚Äì most notably from the Emirate of Bari, until its destruction in 871. Muslim advances and the fall of Enna, 842‚Äì859 In late 842 or 843, with Neapolitan support, the Muslims conquered Messina. In 845, the fortress of Modica also fell, while the Byzantines, now at peace with the Abbasid Caliphate, received reinforcements from the eastern theme of Charsianon. The two armies met near Butera, where the Byzantines suffered a crushing defeat, losing about 10,000 men. In the wake of this disaster, the Byzantine position deteriorated rapidly: al-Fadl ibn Ja'far took Leontini by a ruse in 846, and the fortress of Ragusa followed in 848, when its garrison was forced by severe famine to surrender to the Muslims, who razed the fortress. At about the same time (late 847 or 848), an attempt by the Byzantine fleet to land troops near Palermo failed, and subsequently the Byzantines lost seven out of their ten ships in a storm. In 851, the capable Muslim governor and general Abu'l-Aghlab Ibrahim died, and the local Muslims elected Abu'l-Aghlab al-Abbas ibn al-Fadl, the victor of Butera, as his successor. Without waiting for confirmation of his appointment from Ifriqiya, the new governor attacked and captured the northern fortress of Caltavuturo, and then turned south towards Enna, whose Byzantine commander refused to meet him in the field. Abbas continued his raid, and in 852‚Äì853 he devastated the Val di Noto. Butera was besieged for five or six months, until its inhabitants came to terms and secured his withdrawal by delivering 5,000‚Äì6,000 prisoners. Few details are known about the events of the next four years, but the picture painted by the sources is one of unopposed Muslim raids across the remaining Byzantine territories. Abbas captured several fortresses, including Cefal√π in 857, the population of which was allowed safe departure before the fortress was razed. Gagliano was also besieged, but not taken. In summer 858, the two sides were engaged in naval combat, probably off Apulia; Abbas' brother Ali managed to defeat the Byzantine fleet of 40 ships in the first engagement, but was in turn defeated and forced to flee in the second. Then, in January 859, the Muslims scored a major success through the capture, with the aid of a Byzantine prisoner, of the hitherto impregnable Enna. As Metcalfe remarks, the capture of the fortress was of major importance, for Enna was the key to Muslim expansion in eastern Sicily: \\"without bringing it under their control, the Muslims were not able to capture and consolidate towns further to the east without the risk of losing their gains in counteroffensives. ... Its fall, followed by its comprehensive sacking and the slaughter of its defenders on 24 January was thus, in military terms, the crowning achievement of the early Aghlabids in Sicily since the fall of Palermo\\". The fall of Enna reduced the Byzantines to the eastern coastal strip between Syracuse and Taormina, and forced the emperor to send a large army and a fleet reported at 300 ships under Constantine Kontomytes, which arrived at Syracuse in autumn 859. Soon after, the Byzantine navy was defeated in a major battle with the Muslims, in which the Byzantines lost a third of their fleet. Nevertheless, the arrival of a large Byzantine army induced several settlements, which had previously submitted to the Muslims, to rise in revolt. Abbas soon suppressed these uprisings and marched against Kontomytes. The two armies met near Cefal√π, and, in the ensuing battle, the Byzantines were heavily defeated and retired to Syracuse, while Abbas strengthened his position by refortifying and colonizing Enna. Fall of Malta and Syracuse= Governorship of Khafaja ibn Sufyan, 861‚Äì869  Abbas died in autumn 861, after another raid into Byzantine territory, and was buried at Caltagirone; the Byzantines later exhumed and burned his corpse. As his replacement, the Sicilian Muslims chose his uncle Ahmad ibn Ya'qub. His tenure was short, as in February 862 he was deposed in favour of Abdallah, son of Abbas. Abdallah's general Rabah was able to capture a few Byzantine fortresses, despite suffering a defeat in battle at first. Abdallah's elevation, however, was not acknowledged by the Aghlabids, and he was replaced, after only five months in office, by Khafaja ibn Sufyan. In 863, Khafaja sent his son Muhammad to raid the environs of Syracuse, but he was defeated by the Byzantines and forced to retire. In February/March 864, however, with the aid of a Byzantine renegade, the Muslims captured Noto and Scicli. In 865, Khafaja led in person an expedition against the environs of Enna‚Äîwhich may signify that the Byzantines had retaken it, or that they still held forts in its vicinity‚Äîbefore moving onto Syracuse, but again his son Muhammad was defeated in an ambush, losing 1,000 men. In 866, Khafaja marched once more against Syracuse. From there he marched along the coast towards the north. There he met a delegation of the citizens of Taormina, who concluded a treaty with him, but soon broke it. In the same year, the Muslims retook Noto and Ragusa, which the Byzantines had apparently recaptured, or which had simply failed to renew their tribute payments after previous capitulations. Khafaja also captured the fortress called \\"al-Giran\\" and a few other towns, before an illness forced him to return to Palermo. In the summer of 867, after the illness had passed, Khafaja led his army towards Syracuse and Catania again, raiding their environs. In September 867, the Byzantine emperor Michael III was killed and succeeded by Basil I the Macedonian. The new emperor was more energetic than his predecessor, and the relative peace on his eastern frontier allowed him to soon turn his full attention to the west: in 868‚Äì869 admiral Niketas Ooryphas was sent to relieve an Arab siege of Ragusa and re- establish imperial authority in Dalmatia, after which he sailed to Italy in an abortive attempt to conclude an alliance through marriage and co-ordinate a joint siege of Bari with the western emperor, Louis II. Another fleet was dispatched to Sicily in spring 868, but the Byzantines were heavily defeated by Khafaja in battle, after which the Muslims freely raided the environs of Syracuse. After Khafaga's return to Palermo, his son Muhammad launched a raid against mainland Italy, possibly besieging Gaeta. On his return to Sicily, in January‚ÄìFebruary 869, Muhammad led an attempt to capture Taormina through treason, but although a small Muslim detachment gained control of the gates, Muhammad tarried to arrive with the main army and the detachment, fearing capture, abandoned the city. A month later, Khafaja launched an attack on the region of Mount Etna, probably against the town of Tiracia (modern Randazzo), while Muhammad raided around Syracuse. The Byzantines, however, sortied from the city and defeated Muhammad's men, inflicting heavy casualties, forcing Khafaja to turn on Syracuse himself. He reportedly laid siege to the city for a few weeks, before turning back towards Palermo in June. On his march home, however, he was assassinated by a dissatisfied Berber soldier, who then fled to Syracuse. It was a heavy loss for the Sicilian Muslims. The motives for the murder remain unclear: Metcalfe suggests a dispute over the division of spoils between the various sections of the Muslim army, but Alexander Vasiliev suggested the possibility that the Berber soldier was in the Byzantines' pay.  Muslim capture of Malta and Syracuse, 870‚Äì878  Khafaja was succeeded by his son Muhammad, elected by the Sicilian army and confirmed by the Aghlabid emir. In contrast to his previous energy, Muhammad was a sedentary governor, preferring to remain in his capital rather than campaign in person. His tenure was furthermore cut short when he was assassinated by his court eunuchs on 27 May 871. Nevertheless, his tenure is associated with a major success of long- term significance, the capture of Malta. Of all the islands around Sicily, this was the last to remain in Byzantine hands, and in 869 a fleet under Ahmad ibn Umar ibn Ubaydallah ibn al-Aghlab al-Habashi attacked it. The Byzantines, having received timely reinforcements, resisted successfully at first, but in 870 Muhammad sent a fleet from Sicily to the island, and the capital Melite fell on 29 August. The local governor was captured, the town was plundered‚ÄîAhmad al-Habashi reportedly took along the local cathedral's marble columns to decorate his palace‚Äîand its fortifications razed. The fall of Malta had important ramifications for the defence of what remained of Byzantine Sicily: with Reggio in Calabria and now Malta in their hands, the Muslims completed their encirclement of the island, and could easily interdict any aid sent from the east. The fall of Syracuse to the Arabs, from the Madrid Skylitzes From 872 to 877 there was apparently a period of calm, since the sources are silent on any military operations in Sicily. This was probably chiefly due to internal turmoil in Muslim Sicily, with six governors reported as having taken office during this period, as well as the weakness of the Aghlabid government on the Ifriqiyan mainland. In Italy, Muslim raids continued, but the Byzantines had a major success in 875 or 876, after the death of Louis II, when they took possession of Bari. In 875, the unwarlike and pleasure-loving Aghlabid emir Muhammad II ibn Ahmad (r. 864‚Äì875) died, and was succeeded by his more energetic brother, Ibrahim II (r. 875‚Äì902). The new Emir of Ifriqiya was determined to finally capture Syracuse. He appointed a new governor for the island, Ja'far ibn Muhammad, and sent a fleet from Ifriqiya to his assistance. Ja'far began his campaign in 877, raiding the Byzantine territories and occupying some outlying forts around Syracuse, before settling down to besiege the city. The Muslims, well supplied with siege weapons, launched incessant attacks on the city's defenders, but Syracuse received scant reinforcements from Constantinople, where the bulk of the imperial fleet was apparently occupied with carrying building materials for a sumptuous new church built by Emperor Basil. During nine months of siege, the Arabs gradually occupied the outer defences, and finally, on 21 May 878, stormed the city. The population was massacred or enslaved, and the city thoroughly looted over two months. Completion of the Muslim conquest=Dissension among the Sicilian Muslims, 878‚Äì900 dinar, minted in Sicily, 879 Despite the major success of capturing Syracuse, the Muslim province in Sicily now degenerated into internal strife. Soon after the city's fall, Ja'far ibn Muhammad was murdered by his own slaves, at the instigation of his uncle and his brother, who then usurped the governorship. They were in turn overthrown in September 878, and sent to Ifriqiya where they were executed. Ibrahim II then briefly named his own son as governor, before the appointment of the Sicilian Husayn ibn Rabah. Husayn renewed the campaigns against the remaining Byzantine strongholds in the northeast, especially Taormina, in 879‚Äì880, but without success. Indeed, the Byzantines were able to launch a limited counteroffensive in 880, when the admiral Nasar defeated an Aghlabid fleet in a daring night attack in the Ionian Sea, and then proceeded to raid the environs of Palermo, before defeating another Aghlabid fleet at the Battle of Stelai. In 881‚Äì882, Taormina was again the target of a determined Muslim attack, but held out, and a Muslim army under Abu Thawr was annihilated by the Byzantines at Caltavuturo, causing a large-scale mobilization of the Sicilian Muslims. Over the next years, the Muslims launched several raids, against Catania, Taormina and \\"the king's city\\" (possibly Polizzi) in 883, against Rometta and Catania in 884, and again against Catania and Taormina in 885. These expeditions were successful insofar as they yielded sufficient booty or tribute to pay the army, but failed to capture any Byzantine strongholds. The same period, 885‚Äì886, also saw a resurgence of Byzantine strength in the Italian mainland, where Nikephoros Phokas the Elder won a string of victories against the Muslims. It was in this climate of military failure that the discontent among broad sections of the Sicilian Muslim population, hitherto kept in check by successful raiding, erupted into open rebellion. In the later narrative sources, this conflict between the ruling elite and the lower classes is often simplified to an \\"ethnic\\" struggle between the (ruling) \\"Arabs\\" and the (rebel) \\"Berbers\\".For a brief overview of Arab‚ÄìBerber antagonism in early Islamic times, cf. . In December 886, the people of Palermo deposed the governor, Sawada ibn Khafaja, and sent him to Ifriqiya. Emir Ibrahim II appointed a new governor, who was able to calm the situation temporarily through successful raids and the victory over a Byzantine fleet off Milazzo in 888, which enabled the Sicilian Muslims to launch destructive raids into Calabria. In the next year, Sawada returned, with fresh Ifriqiyan troops, and launched yet another failed attack on Taormina. However, in March 890, another rebellion broke out in Palermo, this time apparently among the Sicilian Arabs, and directed against Sawada's Ifriqiyans. Coupled with a major rebellion in Ifriqiya itself in 894‚Äì895, this put an end to Muslim raids against the Byzantines, and resulted in the conclusion of a truce in 895‚Äì896. According to its terms, in exchange for peace, over 40 months the Byzantines would gradually release their Muslim prisoners, by turns a group of \\"Arabs\\" and a group of \\"Berbers\\", totaling some 1,000 men. As Metcalfe remarks, \\"not only does this show the extent of Christian military success against the Aghlabids in eastern Sicily, but it may also have been deliberately aimed at exacerbating tensions within the Muslim army by playing off one faction against another in negotiating their staggered release\\". In the event, a full- scale civil war between \\"Arabs\\" and \\"Berbers\\" erupted in 898, prompting the dispatch of Ibrahim II's son Abu'l-Abbas Abdallah, who had previously suppressed the rebellion in Iriqiya, to the island at the head of an army in summer 900. By then, the Muslims' infighting had acquired a regional dimension, with the Palermitans pitted against the Agrigentans. After negotiations between the Ifriqiyans and the rival Sicilian parties failed, Abu'l-Abbas Abdallah marched on Palermo, which he captured on 18 September. A great number of the rebels fled the city to the Byzantines in Taormina, with some reaching even Constantinople itself. Ibrahim II's arrival and the fall of Taormina, 901‚Äì902 The Byzantines tried to take advantage of the revolt, and began assembling forces at Messina and Reggio, while a fleet was dispatched from Constantinople. Abu'l-Abbas, however, did not tarry and as soon as he had suppressed the rebellion, marched against the Byzantines, ravaging the environs of Taormina and launching an unsuccessful siege of Catania before returning to winter in Palermo. In the next spring, he resumed his attack and assaulted Val Demone. To disrupt the Byzantine preparations, his forces then crossed over to the mainland. Reggio was captured on 10 July, and was subjected to a savage sack; a vast booty was collected, over 15,000 of its inhabitants were carted off as slaves, and the jizya imposed on the remainder. On his return to Sicily, Abu'l-Abbas came across a Byzantine fleet that had just arrived from Constantinople and thoroughly defeated it, capturing thirty of its vessels. In early 902, Emir Ibrahim II was forced into abdication by his subjects, through the intervention of the Abbasid caliph. Ibrahim exchanged places with Abu'l-Abbas, who was named as his successor: Abu'l-Abbas left Sicily for Ifriqiya, while Ibrahim now resolved to take up the mantle of the Holy War, and accompanied a group of volunteers to Sicily in the summer. In an act that broke the long-standing stalemate on the island, Ibrahim and his followers advanced on Taormina, defeated the Byzantine garrison before its walls and laid siege to it. Left unsupported by the imperial government, the town fell on 1 August. Ibrahim then capitalized on his success by sending raiding parties against various strongholds in the vicinity, forcing either their capitulation and destruction or the payment of tribute. Indefatigable, Ibrahim now crossed over into the mainland, where cities as far as Naples began to prepare to resist his attack. In the end, his advance was stopped at the siege of Cosenza, where Ibrahim died of dysentery on October 24. His grandson stopped the military campaign and returned to Sicily.  Aftermath  Although few strongholds in the northeast remained unconquered and in Christian hands, the fall of Taormina marked the effective end of Byzantine Sicily, and the consolidation of Muslim control over the island. However, it did not signal the end of Arab‚ÄìByzantine warfare on and around the island. In 909, Sicily, like Ifriqiya itself, passed under the control of the Fatimid Caliphate. The Fatimids (and after the 950s the Kalbid hereditary governors) continued the conquest, both against the Christian strongholds in the northeast (the Val Demone) and, more prominently, against the Byzantine possessions in southern Italy, punctuated by truces. Taormina itself threw off Muslim control soon after 902, and it was not until 962, possibly in response to the Byzantine reconquest of Crete the previous year, that the Fatimids retook the town, following a 30-week siege. In the next year, the Muslims attacked the last remaining Christian stronghold on the island, Rometta, which prompted an expedition sent by the Byzantine emperor, Nikephoros II Phokas, to recover Sicily. The Byzantines were at first successful, recapturing Messina and other fortresses in the northeast, but were repulsed before Rometta itself, and retreated back to Calabria. In the next year, they tried to resume their offensive, but were annihilated in the \\"Battle of the Straits\\" (waq øat al-majƒÅz) off Messina. As a result, a lasting truce was concluded by the two powers in 967. Sicilian raids on Italy continued, and prompted the intervention of the Western Emperor, Otto II, in the peninsula in 982, where he was defeated at the Battle of Stilo. It was not until the 1020s that the Byzantines turned their attention to Sicily again, after a period of consolidation of their position in southern Italy under the capable Catepan Basil Boioannes. A large force landed in Messina in 1025, but the expedition was called off when news came of the death of Emperor Basil II. A final effort was made in 1038, when the talented young general George Maniakes was dispatched to Sicily, taking advantage of internal conflicts between the Kalbids and the Zirids. Maniakes quickly recaptured the entire eastern coast, but the conquest was left incomplete when he was recalled to Constantinople by jealous rivals. The Kalbids soon recovered their losses, and Messina, the last Byzantine outpost, fell in 1042. The Arabs remained in control of Sicily until the Norman conquest of the island, which was also a prolonged affair, lasting from the first invasion in 1061 to the surrender of Noto in 1091.  Impact  The long Arab‚ÄìByzantine struggle left abiding traces on the island's subsequent history: although under Muslim rule, Sicilian culture quickly became Arabicized, the Christian communities in the central and eastern parts largely resisted islamization. The level of Arab influence, as attested through surviving toponyms, also varied across the island depending on the length of resistance and the extent of Arab settlement: there are many Arab-derived names in the western third (the Val di Mazara), are more mixed in the southeastern third (Val di Noto), while Christian identities survived most strongly in the northeastern third of the island (Val Demone), which was the last to fall, where Christian refugees from other parts of Sicily had assembled, and which furthermore remained in contact with Byzantine southern Italy.

In 1969, Hall founded the Theatre Historical Society of America. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Ben Hall resided in Manhattan, near the Hudson River, at 181 Christopher Street in Greenwich Village. He lived in the upper two floors of a former steamship company. He was murdered there in December, 1970, just short of his 49th birthday. The following is excerpted from his obituary entitled \\"Benjamin Hall is Found Slain in New York, Atlanta Author,\\" which ran in the Atlanta Constitution of December 17th, 1970: \\"Benjamin M. Hall III, 48-year-old author... was born in Atlanta and was active in the Boys Scouts when he attended Druid Hills High School in DeKalb County. He attended Millsaps College in Jackson, Miss., and graduated cum laude from the University of North Carolina School of Journalism. He was a member of Kappa Sigma Fraternity. An infantry captain during World War II, he later worked for Doubleday Publishing Co. He joined Time Magazine in New York, working from 1956 to 1962 as a promotion copy writer and from 1962 to 1965 as a staff writer. He also served as managing editor of Show Magazine. Hall was the author of the book ‚ÄúThe Best Remaining Seats,‚Äù a history of the golden age of the movie palace, published in 1961.

Well, let me tell you more! :For a long time some of us have talked about forming a club that would foster our interest in the fast-vanishing motion picture theatre and all the wonderful things that used to happen in it. I am delighted to be able to report that someone is finally doing something about it. My longtime friend, Brother Andrew Corsini Fowler, has decided that it is time for action and he, together with a bunch of hard-core theatre buffs from all parts of the country, have had our heads together (perhaps it would be more honest to say that Andy has knocked them together) and come up with an idea. :We are forming the Theatre Historical Society. The name is purposely all- purpose; though we all love movie palaces best, deep down we share an appreciation for any place where people are entertained in rows of seats - from nickelodeons to the newest Kultur Komplexes - in other words, all kinds of theatres and auditoriums. But in case you have misgivings, our main concern will be those picture pagodas of fragrant memory with the jeweled curtains the fountained goldfish, the rising orchestras (and falling organists), the tinkling tap shoes, the gold-braided ushers, the rose-budded cashiers, the yapping wonder dogs, the chirping Sunkist Beauties, the Antarctic air conditioning (and the frost-bitten marquees), the clouds in the ceiling, and the silvery Magnascope screens where \\"The End\\" used to ripple on the peanut curtain as it closed in for the organlogue. Remember...? :The Theatre Historical Society will have a magazine called Marquee (that's the logo Lester Glassner has designed for us at the top of this page) which will be published six times a year ... on a modest scale at first., more lavishly and more frequently as we get rolling. It will be filled with pictures and articles on every phase of movie palace lore -- portfolios of tantalizing newspaper ads, articles on everything from how to build your own model movie palace, how a Publix seat indicator works, how to operate the Brenkert F-7 Master Brenograph, to what to do in case of a stink bomb attack; picture stories on leading theatre architects (maybe special issues devoted to the work of one man); reports on everything from the animal rooms on the Keith Circuit to the hospital facilities in the super-palaces. The possibilities are endless. :The editor of MARQUEE will be Brother Andrew, and there is no one in the country more dedicated or more knowledgeable when it comes to our favorite subject. Frank Cronican has volunteered to be treasurer of the Society; Frank is one of the nation's most skillful model builders and is presently re-creating Chicago's Avalon Theatre in his basement (besides, he has an honest face). A board of directors will be elected later; meanwhile we need lots of help from people like you. For my part, I will sit on a side aisle and give lots of free advice to everybody, and contribute a regular column called \\"Around The Circuit\\" as well as an article from time to time. Your contributions, in the form of stories, photographs, \\"memorabilia\\" and suggestions will always be welcome. :For those of us who are members of A.T.O.E., membership in T.H.S. should entail no conflict of interest -- simply an extension of a special enthusiasm. MARQUEE plans to limit its concern with theatre organs to their consoles, grilles, players and presentation -- all externals in a manner of speaking - and at the same time hopes THEATRE ORGAN BOMBARDE will continue with its wonderful \\"Acre of Seats in a Palace of Splendor\\" feature. And subscribers to the CONSOLE need have no fear of cross-purposes in the pages of MARQUEE; there is enough material on theatres to keep everybody fascinated for years to come. :I would like to invite you to join with us in this interesting and worthwhile venture by becoming a Founding Member of The Theatre Historical Society. In return, we need three things from you: (1) A check for $10.00. (2) A list of names and addresses of people you think would like to join the Society as regular members (dues are $5.00 which includes the first six issues of MARQUEE). (3) Your comments, ideas and suggestions on how the Society and MARQUEE can best serve us all in our mutual and rather unique interest. This last request is very important as it gives you a chance to help guide the club in its formative period. :I hope you will join in the fun. Send your check for $10.00 made out to The Theatre Historical Society, your prospective-member list, and your comments to me at 181 Christopher Street, New York, N.Y. 10014. Please do it this week. We want to get the first issue of MARQUEE out as soon as possible, and we need your support before that can happen. :With best remaining wishes, :Ben M.

Emma Florence Langdon (1875 in Tennessee - 1937) moved to the gold mining district of Cripple Creek, Colorado in 1903. She was an apprentice linotype operator who wrote that \\"women's place should be in the home and not in public life.\\"All That Glitters--Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 240. In spite of such sentiments, she played a very visible role during some very turbulent times. She and her husband were working at the Victor Daily Record, a pro-union newspaper, during a 1903-04 strike of miners in the Cripple Creek gold fields that erupted into the Colorado Labor Wars. Along with many other union sympathizers, Langdon was forced to leave in 1904, and moved to Denver.David Brundage, The Making of Western Labor Radicalism: Denver's Organized Workers, 1878-1905, 1994, pages 1-3. History Republican governor of Colorado James Peabody had sent the national guard into Cripple Creek to suppress the strike. The Daily Record erroneously charged that one of the soldiers was an ex-convict. Its staff was imprisoned by the national guard in a bullpen before a retraction could be published.Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, George G. Suggs, Jr., 1972, page 96. While Victor Daily Record editor George Kyner and four printers were in the bullpen, Emma Langdon, a linotype operator married to one of the imprisoned printers, sneaked into the Daily Record office and barricaded herself inside. She printed the next edition of the paper, and then delivered it to the prisoners in the bullpen.All That Glitters--Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 209. Langdon was the only linotype operator in Victor who was overlooked by the national guard. She received a telephone message at midnight about the raid, and rushed to the office, barred the doors, and printed a four-page edition of the morning paper, with the headline across the top -- Somewhat Disfigured but Still in the Ring. The next morning Emma Langdon arrived at the bullpen with an armload of papers intended for the prisoners. She was stopped by the guards. She recorded in her 1908 book, Labors' Greatest Conflicts, that the national guard officers were, > ...discussing with glee the \\"great victory in suppressing the paper.\\" Their > laughter was soon changed to oaths when they were dramatically presented the > papers that were intended for the imprisoned printers. The Associated Press picked up the story of the apprentice printer who could not be intimidated. The Daily Record did not miss an issue as a result of the arrests. The printers were held for twenty-four hours, charged with criminal libel, and then were released on bond. When the cases went to court, all charges were dismissed. For defying the militia and producing an issue of the union paper by herself, Langdon was presented with an engraved gold medal at the Western Federation of Miners convention in 1904, and was made an honorary member of the union.Labors' Greatest Conflicts, Emma F. Langdon, May 1908, page 10, 21-22. Although the designation was somewhat overused in the period, Langdon was frequently referred to as Labor's Joan of Arc. Affiliations Langdon was secretary of the Victor Women's Auxiliary, vice-president of the Victor Trades Assembly, a member of the Typographical Union in Victor, and later of TU Local No. 49 in Denver. She became chair of the Typographical Union executive board. She attended the 1905 founding convention of the Industrial Workers of the World in Chicago, where she was elected assistant secretary under general secretary-treasurer William Trautmann.CONVENTION, Industrial Workers of the World, SECOND DAY‚ÄîWednesday, June 28, MORNING SESSION. http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/unions/iww/1905/convention/ch03.htm Retrieved March 18, 2007.

Established in 1986, the Foundation's original purpose was to ensure continued charitable donations by the Green Bay Packers football team. Although it is legally a separate entity from the Packers, a Board of Trustees consisting of 10 members of the Green Bay Packers Board of Directors leads the Foundation. It receives most of its funding from the team. The Foundation provides grant opportunities to Wisconsin-based 501(c)(3) organizations for community improvement projects. , the Foundation has donated more than $11 million and maintains an endowment fund exceeding $40 million. History Judge Robert J. Parins, who was the president of the Green Bay Packers from 1982 to 1989, founded the Green Bay Packers Foundation in 1986. His desire was for the Foundation to be the charitable arm of the Packers organization and to ensure the team maintained strong community outreach. The Foundation has maintained a close relationship with the Packers organization since its founding. Organization Lambeau Field, the home of the Green Bay Packers and the Foundation's headquarters The Packers Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization headquartered at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. It is led by a 10-person Board of Trustees drawn from the Green Bay Packers Board of Directors. The Trustees review the yearly grant applications and decide how much money is to be provided to each applicant. Even though the Foundation is legally a separate entity and not part of the Green Bay Packers organization, it closely follows the goals of the Packers. It is the primary instrument the team uses for charitable giving. This is reinforced by the fact the Green Bay Packers are the primary financial contributor to the Foundation. , the Foundation has amassed an endowment fund totaling over $40 million. The Foundation also has a unique role if the Green Bay Packers are ever sold. The Packers are the only publicly owned team in the National Football League. Instead of a single owner, the organization is owned by 361,169 shareholders who elect a Board of Directors and Executive Committee each year. If the shareholders were to decide to sell the team, the proceeds of the sale would not go to the shareholders. Instead, the Packer's bylaws state the proceeds would go to the Packers Foundation to fund charitable causes. The original bylaws stated the proceeds of any sale would be given to a local American Legion post to fund \\"a proper soldier's memorial\\". However, the shareholders voted to change the bylaws in 1997 to their current wording. , Forbes estimates the Packers are worth $2.63 billion. Activities The Foundation offers grant opportunities to Wisconsin-based charitable organizations to fund projects that further its mission. , the Foundation's mission is to assist local organizations which promote families, support athletic competitions, improve the welfare of Green Bay Packers players and fans, promote the education and safety of children, and reduce cruelty to animals. The grant opportunities are open to eligible organizations that apply during three-year cycles. Each year has a different focus area that falls under the Foundation's mission. In 2019, the Packers Foundation awarded $2.05 million worth of grants to various organizations that work in the areas of art, athletics, and education; this was the highest total awarded in a single year in the Foundation's history. The 2019 grant awards were not without controversy. One of the organizations that received funding from the Foundation was Planned Parenthood. Pro-life groups noted their disagreement with the grant funding and contrasted it with donations made by the Chicago Bears' charitable organization Bears Cares to the Chicago March for Life. , the Foundation has provided over $12 million in grants since its formation.

During World War II, he was a 20-year-old lieutenant in charge of the Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon, 394th Infantry Regiment, 99th Infantry Division. On the first morning of the Germans' advance during the Battle of the Bulge, his 18-man unit along with four forward artillery observers held off an entire German battalion of more than 500 men for nearly an entire day, killing or wounding 92, and significantly delayed the German advance in a vital sector of the northern front. Every single member of the platoon was later decorated, making it one of the most decorated platoons in all of World War II. Bouck was one of the youngest commissioned officers in the U.S. Army. Early life and enlistment Bouck was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the second child of Lyle Joseph and Magdalen M. Bouck. His father, a Private First Class in the U.S. Army during World War I, was a carpenter and Bouck grew up during the Depression and moved frequently with his family. With four siblings, (Robert, Bernice, Eugene and John) they often lived in homes with only one bedroom and no indoor plumbing or electricity. Bouck enlisted in the National Guard at age 14 so he could earn one dollar per drill day to help his family. He was never asked his age. He was rapidly promoted to Supply Sergeant at age 16, making more than most of his civilian friends. Active duty On December 23, 1940, the 35th Infantry Division was activated for one year of federal duty. His unit participated in the Texas-Louisiana maneuvers of 1941. Bouck was assigned responsibility as transportation sergeant for the regimental Headquarters Company and performed very well. While attending a transportation course, and just before their federal duty was completed, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Their active duty status was indefinitely extended and Bouck's unit was sent to protect California against a possible enemy invasion. When his unit was subsequently moved to advance duty on the Aleutian Islands, he volunteered to attend Officer Candidate School, the newly created Parachute School, or the Army Air Corps. An offer to attend Officer Candidate School arrived first, and Bouck was transferred to Fort Benning, Georgia for four months of intensive training. On his first day there, he was ordered to drill his men. Bouck performed well enough to draw the attention of his commanding officers. He graduated fourth in his class of 57 officers on August 25, 1942. The top ten graduates of each class were retained to teach the next class at Fort Benning, and Bouck was assigned to teach small unit defensive tactics. He spent a year at the school before he was transferred and assigned to the 99th Infantry Division for deployment to Europe. Movement to Europe His division arrived at Le Havre in early November, 1944. By mid-November, without any battle experience, they were in the Ardennes, where they relieved the 60th Regiment, 9th Infantry Division. For the next few weeks his reconnaissance platoon established and maintained regimental listening and observation posts and gathered information. As they were not trained for direct combat, they were kept from direct engagement with the Germans. Bouck earned the Combat Infantryman Badge during this period. The platoon consisted of two nine-man reconnaissance squads and a seven-man headquarters section who worked in the 394th regimental S2 section. Their mission was to conduct reconnaissance up to and through the German lines, including missions to capture German soldiers, to obtain intelligence about the enemy forces' disposition. Battle near Lanzerath The Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon attached to the 394th Infantry Regiment of the 99th division was the most decorated platoon of World War II for action on the first morning of the Battle of the Bulge defending a key road in the vicinity of the Losheim Gap. Led by 20-year-old Lieutenant Lyle Bouck Jr., the second youngest man in the unit, the unit of 18 men along with four U.S. Forward Artillery Observers from Battery C, 371st Field Artillery, held off an entire German battalion of over 500 men during a 10-hour-long fight, inflicting 92 casualties on the Germans. The platoon seriously disrupted the entire Sixth Panzer Army's schedule of attack along the northern edge of the offensive. At dusk on 16 December, about 50 German paratroopers finally flanked the platoon and captured the remaining 15 soldiers. Two who had been sent on foot to regimental headquarters to seek reinforcements were also later captured, and a member of the forward artillery observation platoon assisting the platoon was killed. Due to the capture of the platoon's soldiers and the blur of events during the first week of this massive campaign, the U.S. Army did not recognize the platoon for its courageous deeds for 37 years. On October 25, 1981, the entire platoon was recognized with a Presidential Unit Citation, and every member of the platoon was decorated, including four Distinguished Service Crosses, five Silver Stars, and ten Bronze Stars with V for Valor. Prisoners of war The I&R platoon members who were able to walk were sent east into Germany. After two days of walking through the cold, Bouck and the remainder of his platoon were loaded into a boxcar in the village of Junkerath. Bouck was jammed into a single railroad cattle car with 71 other POWs and traveled for days without food or water. By Christmas Day, seven men in Bouck's car had died and the rest were barely hanging on. The prisoners were transported to hospitals in Frankfurt and Hanover. Their unmarked trains were prime targets for Allied aircraft, who attacked the train on December 21, killing and wounding several POWs. The POWs were allowed off only once, and were given only a few slices of bread and some water to drink during the entire trip.

Bouck and his men were finally imprisoned in Stalag XIII-D in Nuremberg and later in Stalag XIII-C in Hammelburg, where the non- commissioned and enlisted men were split, with the officers sent to Oflag XIII-B. Cpl. Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston were captured before they reached Allied lines, and they later joined Bouck and the rest of the platoon in the POW camps. The men barely survived, most suffering from the advanced effects of malnutrition. When Task Force Baum from Patton's 4th Armored Division raided the camp, Bouck pretended to be a field grade officer and accompanied the task force as it attempted to return to the front lines. However, almost the entire task force was captured or killed, and Bouck was wounded and returned to prison. He was transferred to N√ºrnberg and then Moosberg, where he spent the remainder of the war. When he was freed one week before the war ended, he weighed and had contracted hepatitis. He was hospitalized in Reims and then to Paris. In mid-June, he flew to the U.S. and eventually was hospitalized at O'Reilly General Hospital in Springfield, Missouri, before he was released home. Aftermath Bouck considered the wounding of most of his men and the capture of his entire unit a failure. He only later learned that because his platoon prevented the lead German infantry elements from advancing, armor units were backed up behind them for miles during the entire day. At the end of the fight, exhausted from more than 15 hours of continuous combat, out of contact with their division, and out of ammunition, after Bouck and most of his men had been wounded, the platoon was overrun by German soldiers. The remaining 15 men were captured and were prisoners of war in freezing, disease-infested prison camps for five months until the war ended, and were near death when their own Army division freed them. Sepp Dietrich, in charge of the Sixth Panzer Army, had charged his best colonel, Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Joachim Peiper, commander of a Kampfgruppe from 1st SS Panzer Division, with leading the push to Antwerp. Peiper led a composite kampfgruppe built around the 1st SS Panzer Regiment (SSLAH), reconnaissance, infantry and associated elements of the LAH Division and 501st Schwere Panzer Abteilung, equipped with a mix of Tiger and King Tiger tanks. The unit finally arrived in Lanzerath just after midnight, having been delayed 12 hours by horrendous road traffic, blown bridges, and ultimately the tenacious defense of the American soldiers. The eighteen men's day-long battle not only prevented the German infantry from advancing, but held up the entire 6th Panzer Army behind them. Instead of reaching the Meuse River on the battle's first day, the Germans went almost nowhere. The entire northern wing of the German attack fell hopelessly behind schedule, never to recover. Author Alex Kershaw said, \\"Had they not stood and held the Germans and halted their attack, or rather postponed it for a crucial 24 hours, the Battle of the Bulge would have been a great German victory.\\" Bouck attributed the unit's success to the fact that all of his men were expert marksmen. The excellent defensive terrain, the extra weapons Bouck acquired, and their prepared and well- concealed defensive positions contributed significantly to the massively disproportionate casualties they inflicted on the Germans. The inadequately trained and inexperienced German troops also attacked across an open field in waves that made them easy targets for Bouck and his men. Due to their capture and the general chaos of the Battle of the Bulge, the unit's story was not well known. When Lt. Bouck was freed as a prisoner of war, he was too weak to file a combat report, and didn't think much of what the men had done. \\"We were in those foxholes and ... what we did was to defend ourselves and try to live through it.\\" Civilian life After the war ended, Bouck returned to St Louis and began duty as a recruiter. He was reintroduced to a fifth grade classmate, Lucille Zinzer, and began courting her. He was considering applying for a regular U.S. Army commission and West Point, when he applied for back pay for accumulated leave. The Army paid him for the leave at an enlisted man's pay rate, despite the fact that he'd been an officer while accruing the leave, and Bouck was furious. Bouck earned a high school equivalency diplomacy and married Lucille on April 27, 1946. Bouck then attended the Missouri Chiropractic College on the G.I. Bill and graduated in 1949. He practiced for nearly fifty years, until 1997. They had 5 children, Daniel, Diane, Denise, Douglas and Dwight. Two of his sons served as U.S. Navy pilots and the third followed his career as a chiropractor. He was a charter member of the Concord Village Lion's Club and served as its initial president. His unit's actions were largely forgotten or unknown. Of his war experience, his wife Lucy said, \\"He never talked about it. Never.\\" In 1965, the U.S. Army published a multi- volume history of World War II, The Ardennes: The Battle of the Bulge. Author Hugh M. Cole mentioned Bouck's platoon in passing, which upset platoon member William James (Tsakanikas). He contacted Bouck and encouraged his former commanding officer to get his men their proper recognition. Bouck contacted his former division commander, Maj. Gen. Walter E. Lauer, who nominated Bouck for a Silver Star. To Bouck's surprise, the Silver Star arrived in Bouck's mailbox in June 1966, but no other man was recognized, which upset Bouck. He was shortly afterwards interviewed by John S. D. Eisenhower for his book The Bitter Woods, in which the actions of the unit were told in detail. Eisenhower became the Ambassador to Belgium and hosted Bouck and other members of the platoon when they visited Lanzerath in December 1969. Tsakanikas' war wounds troubled him for the rest of his life, and after his 37th operation, he died from complication on June 27, 1977. Columnist Jack Anderson unsuccessfully campaigned to see that William James (Tsakanikas) be awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously. Bouck died on December 2, 2016 from pneumonia. Unit recognition On October 26, 1981, after considerable lobbying and letter- writing by Bouck, members of the unit were finally decorated. Fourteen of the 18 members were present at a special World War II Valor Awards ceremony at Ft. Myer, Virginia. Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh hosted the ceremony. Every member of the platoon was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. Four members‚ÄîBouck, Slape, Milosevich, and Tsakanikas‚Äîwere given the Distinguished Service Cross; five were given Silver Stars, and ten the Bronze Star with V devices, all for their 10-hour struggle with an entire 500-man-strong German battalion. In 2004, the book The Longest Winter was published documenting the defensive actions of the platoon. Bouck cooperated with the author, Alex Kershaw, but imposed one condition, \\"I told him that other authors never wrote about the other men in the platoon, just me. I said I wouldn't talk to him unless he promised that he'd also write about the other men.\\" ReferencesFurther reading  External links * Category:1923 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from St. Louis County, Missouri Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:American prisoners of war in World War II Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Germany Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross (United States) Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:United States Army officers ","title":"Lyle Bouck"},{"id":"10135104","text":"Audiograbber is a proprietary freeware CD audio extractor/converter program for Microsoft Windows. It was one of the first programs in the genre to become popular. The data extraction algorithm was designed by Jackie Franck and was included in the Xing Technology software package Xing Audio Catalyst in the mid-1990s. It does not use Xing Technology's proprietary MP3 encoding library. Instead, it uses the LAME encoder, Ogg Vorbis encoder, WMA codec, as well as any format supported by an external command-line encoder library. The author is no longer developing this software. Audiograbber is able to rip CDs, or record audio coming in via mic jack, or capture audio playing on the computer but not from the internet, into several formats, including WAV, MP3 and others. It performs the conversions entirely digitally, bypassing the system sound card, enabling accurate digital conversion. For convenience, it supports the freedb database of Compact Disc track listings (offline as of June 13, 2020), to allow ripped tracks, with reduced user effort, to have the names of songs, artists and albums. It also supports normalizing, ID3 tag and CD-Text support. A line-in sampling function can automatically split LP recordings into separate tracks, plus it can perform noise reduction with a proprietary VST plug-in from Algorithmix. Prior to the release of version 1.83 in February 2004, Audiograbber was shareware. The unregistered versions of the software only allowed a random selection of half the tracks of a given CD to be extracted in each ripping session. These limitations in the software were due to a restrictive clause in an agreement between the author and Xing Technology. After the agreement expired, the software was made available as freeware with no limitations on its function. Version 1.83 (as well as the convenient Lame plugin installer on the same site) from the developer site comes bundled with several adware like Funmoods Toolbar, Conduit Search, Zapp, VO Package, Browser Utility, AnyProtect. One has to read the installation screens carefully and deselect everything that one does not want to install.

He played college football at the University of Kansas. He now officiates Junior High Football in Missouri. Early years Patterson attended Jack Yates High School. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Kansas, where he began his career as a linebacker. As a senior, he was initially moved to defensive end, before being switched to cornerback. Professional career=New York Giants He was selected by the Jacksonville Bulls in the tenth round (210th overall) of the 1984 USFL Draft. He instead chose to sign as an undrafted free agent with the New York Giants on May 17, 1984. As a rookie, he played mainly on special teams. In 1985, he was named the starter at left cornerback. In 1986, he helped the team win Super Bowl XXI. Patterson's nickname of \\"Toast\\" is a rather unflattering one that was given to him by Bill Parcells during his days as a Giant; the name comes from his knack for allowing wide receivers to make big plays while he was covering them. He was surprisingly waived on September 15, 1987, after a Monday Night Football performance against the Chicago Bears where he had to leave the game in two occasions with leg cramps and his coverage was badly beaten by Willie Gault (it was later claimed that the night before he was out partying). San Diego Chargers After the players went on a strike on the third week of the 1987 season, those games were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. Patterson was signed to be a part of the San Diego Chargers replacement team. He ended up playing well as the left cornerback starter, and was kept for the rest of the year, recording 8 additional starts. After three inconsistent seasons, he was left unprotected in Plan B free agency in 1990. Los Angeles Raiders On April 2, 1990, he signed as a Plan B free agent with the Los Angeles Raiders. He was waived on September 3 and later re-signed. He became a special teams standout and earned the nickname Ghost. He was a special teams captain for three years. On October 13, 1993, he was traded along with a seventh round pick (#216-Toddrick McIntosh) to the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for a fifth round (#159-Roosevelt Patterson) and a seventh round draft choice (#217-Rob Holmberg). Dallas Cowboys In 1993, he played mainly on special teams, registering 13 special teams tackles (fourth on the team) and was a part of the Super Bowl XXVIII Championship team.

He served in various staff positions within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, and was assigned to the Taiwan Army of Japan in 1917. In 1935 he served on the staff of the Kwantung Army and participated in Operation Chahar. Nasu was promoted to major general in 1940, and became commander of the IJA 3rd Infantry Brigade. Nasu commanded a detachment (named after him) during the Battle of Java in the Dutch East Indies campaign. Landing on March 1, 1942, the detachment rapidly progressed across Western Java, facing its heaviest resistance in the Battle of Leuwiliang against primarily Australian troops commanded by Arthur Blackburn. During the Guadalcanal campaign Nasu landed on Guadalcanal with the IJA 2nd Division during the first week of October 1942 in response to the Allied landings on the island. Nasu commanded one of the 2nd Division's large infantry groups, comprising infantry battalions from several regiments during the resulting October Matanikau action and Battle for Henderson Field. On October 25, 1942, while leading his troops against United States positions, Nasu was mortally wounded by rifle fire and died early the next morning.

It is based on the 2003 Rolls-Royce Phantom and has styling heavily derived from the 100EX, a concept car shown to celebrate the company's centennial in 2004. In 2015 it was the most expensive Rolls-Royce model at $533,000. Several Drophead Coup√©s were used in the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. Exterior \\"coach\\" door The exterior resembles that of the 100EX. The 2-door 4-seat convertible has rearward opening coach doors and a two-tone colour scheme that distinguishes between the upper and lower bodywork and frames the teak wood panelling of the convertible's tonneau cover. However, it eschews the EX's aluminium bonnet in favour of more easily maintained stainless steel. The front fascia resembles that of the 100EX but its middle bodywork/raised bonnet/grille assemblage stops midway down rather than continuing downwards and bisecting the front bumper. The headlamps are also those of the 100EX/101EX concept and are similar to the Phantom's. The deep set rectangular high beams are LED units while the round \\"faux-foglamp\\" driving lights are projector-style xenon arc lamps. The exterior is available in more than 44,000 colour combinations. It combines aluminium technology and hand-crafted materials. As with other current Rolls-Royce models, the hood ornament, the Spirit of Ecstasy, automatically retracts into the bonnet whenever the car is locked or whenever the driver so chooses. Interior left The interior has wood veneering that wraps around the 8/9ths top portion of the cabin from coach door to coach door and ends in a crafted convertible tonneau cover, finished in teak panelling sandwiched between an interior band of contrasting hardwood and the bare stainless steel motif of the car's upper exterior bodywork. Like the 100EX and 101EX, the dashboard and the steering wheel are from the Phantom. Triangular A-pillars with quarter glass, and spring-loaded pop-up rollover hoops behind the rear seats, provide additional strength and protection for the convertible body.

Loicq played ice hockey for Belgium men's national ice hockey team and won four bronze medals from in 1910 to 1914. He was a leading supporter of the efforts to introduce ice hockey at the Olympic Games, and served on the organizing committee for ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After playing in the 1920 Olympics he served as president of the Royal Belgian Ice Hockey Federation from 1920 to 1935, and as president of the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG) from 1922 to 1947, which was later known as the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). During his time as president the LIHG more than doubled its membership and welcomed the first national associations from Asia and Africa, and the LIHG began hosting its annual Ice Hockey World Championships in 1930. He was also an international ice hockey referee from 1924 to 1937 at the Olympic Games, the Ice Hockey World Championships and the Ice Hockey European Championships. He served in the Belgian Army during World War I and World War II, achieved the rank of Colonel, and represented Belgium as legal counsel at the Nuremberg trials. Loicq was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the builder's category in 1961. He was the first European to be inducted, and was credited as the main person who introduced hockey to the Olympics. He inducted into the inaugural class of the IIHF Hall of Fame in 1997, and was credited for growing the game of hockey in Europe and raising its worldwide profile. The IIHF established the Paul Loicq Award in 1998, given to recognize an individual for outstanding contributions to the development of international ice hockey. Early life and playing years Loicq was born 11 August 1888 in Brussels, Belgium. He was a speed skater as a youth, and later adapted to playing hockey. He played as a right winger for FP Bruxelles from the 1905‚Äì06 to 1910‚Äì11 seasons, and then played for Cercle des Patineurs Bruxelles (CDP Bruxelles) from the 1911‚Äì12 to 1913‚Äì14 seasons. He played on the Belgium men's national ice hockey team at the Ice Hockey European Championships in the 1910, 1911, and 1914 competitions. The Belgians placed third and won a bronze medal in each of the three years he played. Loicq also played for the national team at the 1912 LIHG Championship and won bronze. He played in three consecutive Belgian Championships with CDP Bruxelles from 1912 to 1914, and was a national champion in 1914. Loicq's ice hockey career went on hiatus during World War I. He resumed playing for CDP Bruxelles from the 1919‚Äì20 to 1922‚Äì23 seasons. He served as the player-coach for the Belgian national team in the winter of 1919‚Äì20, and was the team's captain in ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics. Belgium played an international friendly with the Ice Skating Club de Paris, and lost its sole match at the Olympics by a 0‚Äì8 score to the Sweden men's national ice hockey team. Loicq returned to play with the Belgian national team in 1921, during an international match with Club des Sports d'Hiver de Paris in 1921, and made his final playing appearance with the team at the Ice Hockey European Championship 1925. Military and business career Loicq graduated from university in Brussels as a lawyer. As a businessman, he was in charge of a company which produced medicinal cotton wool. He served in the Belgian Army during World War I, and earned a citation for bravery. He was a leader in the Belgian Resistance against the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, and rose to the rank of Colonel. After the conclusion of the war, Loicq acted as legal representation for Belgium at the Nuremberg trials. Belgian sport administrator The Palais de Glace d'Anvers (pictured) hosted ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics. Loicq was actively involved in organization and management sports as an athlete. He served as president of the Skaters Club of Brussels, the Belgian Federation of Skaters and the Belgian League for Winter Sports. He was also a leading supporter of the efforts to introduce ice hockey at the Olympic Games. His efforts were rewarded in January 1920, when the choice was made to include ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics. Five teams from Europe agreed to play along with Canada and the United States. The Palais de Glace d'Anvers in Antwerp hosted both hockey and the corresponding figure skating events. Loicq served on the Belgian organizing committee for the hockey tournament at the Olympics. The games used the Canadian ice hockey rules, and the Bergvall system to determine medal winning teams. Loicq served as president of the Royal Belgian Ice Hockey Federation (RBIHF) from 1920 to 1935. He succeeded Henri Van den Bulcke, who was the founding president of the RBIHF. When the indoor ice rink in Brussels closed in 1923, the RBIHF was left with only the rink in Antwerp for its indoor matches. Loicq served as head coach of Belgium at the Ice Hockey European Championship 1927. He led Belgium to a silver medal, and a second- place finish to the Austria men's national ice hockey team. His team included captain Willy Kreitz as the best player of the tournament, and Pierre Van Reysschoot. Belgium was given the fair play trophy, which was awarded for the first time in 1927. Belgium lost the ice palace in Antwerp due to a fire in 1928. Loicq later arranged Belgian Championships on frozen ponds until three new rinks opened in Brussels between 1933 and 1935. Loicq also served as vice- president of the Belgian Olympic Committee, and confirmed that Belgium would participate in the 1932 Winter Olympics hosted in Lake Placid, New York. During the bid process for the 1932 Winter Olympics, Loicq abstained in discussions on the downsizing of the Olympic event schedule. LIHG president Loicq was elected president of the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG) in 1922 to succeed Max Sillig. Loicq served in the role for 25 years until 1947 during a period of growth for the LIHG. The federation expanded from 11 national member associations based in Europe and North America to 27 members globally in 1947, including Japan in 1930 as the first member from Asia, and South Africa in 1937 as the first member from Africa. Chamoix, France, hosted both ice hockey at the 1924 Winter Olympics (pictured) and the 1930 World Ice Hockey Championships. In 1924, Loicq and the LIHG assisted in organizing a hockey tournament at the International Winter Sports Week held in Chamonix, France. The International Olympic Committee retroactively recognized this event as ice hockey at the 1924 Winter Olympics. The games were played outside on natural ice, and used a two-tier round-robin format to replace the Bergvall system. In 1928, the LIHG decided that ice hockey at the 1928 Winter Olympics would also determine the European Championship, instead of hosting a separate event. The 1928 event included 11 teams, the most number of participants at the time. Sweden won the silver medal at the Olympics, and were crowned European champions at the same time. After the increased participation at the Olympic Games, the LIHG congress decided that Ice Hockey World Championships would be hosted annually starting in 1930. The World Championships also doubled as the European Championships thereafter. The 1930 World Ice Hockey Championships was the first annual event, and was scheduled to play outdoors in Chamonix, France. The natural ice melted and the event relocated to indoor venues in Berlin and Vienna for the final matches. Loicq had several disagreements with the planning of ice hockey at the 1932 Winter Olympics. He stated that \\"according to the Olympic statutes it is the International and not the National Federation which is in charge of organizing the Games. It would be preferable that the harmony should be restored between the International Federation and the American Ice Hockey Federation\\". The International Society of Olympic Historians felt the dispute came from the Amateur Athletic Union controlling the selection of American amateur teams for the Olympics on behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, and the ensuing power struggle with the LIHG. There was also a disagreement in the number of players on hockey teams. The LIHG stated it should be 14, whereas the organizing committee published 13 players. When the 1932 tournament was played, only four teams participated, with only two European associations making the trip due to the high cost of travel. The European teams instead played at the Ice Hockey European Championship 1932 with nine teams participating. The 1932 event was the final time that the European Championships were held separately from the World Championships. The Riessersee (pictured) hosted a portion of the matches in ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics. Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics was hosted in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, with games being played at the partially- covered Olympia-Kunsteisstadion on artificial ice, and on natural ice at Riessersee. The number of participating nations rebounded from the 1932 Olympics with an increase to 15. The tournament saw the Great Britain men's national ice hockey team which included British-Canadian dual citizens capture the gold medal, over the defending champion Canada men's national ice hockey team which won silver. Loicq mediated two protests by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) for the hockey tournament. The CAHA had originally protested the use of two players by Great Britain which were suspended by the CAHA. Loicq agreed that the suspended players could not be used in the Olympics, but Canada relented on its protest on the eve of the Olympics due to international pressure, and not being aware that Loicq had agreed to the suspensions. He later called an emergency meeting regarding the format of the finals protested by Canada, which was denied in a vote of delegates. He later denied accusations from Canadian Amateur Hockey Association president E. A. Gilroy that the rules were changed during the event. In February 1937, the LIHG passed resolutions in wake of discussions began during the previous Olympics. The LIHG decided to award future World Championships only to countries with an artificial ice rink available for the games. Exhibition games between professional and amateur teams were now allowed, and national associations were given control over sanctioning events for both amateurs and professionals in their respective countries. The LIHG also allowed up to two professionals on an amateur team in international competition, and that a player must represent his country of birth unless he was a five-year resident of the adoptive country he wished to play for. Loicq felt that the resolutions were passed since member associations did not want to play against multiple teams in the British Empire with Canadian-trained players. He was also expected to report on investigations into professionalism in the amateur game at the World Championships. In 1937, the LIHG decided to host World Championships only in non-Olympic years, and to recognize the Olympic ice hockey tournament as the World Championship for that year. The LIHG did not host any World Championships or Olympic tournaments from 1939 to 1946 due to World War II, and had not held a congress in seven years until meeting in Brussels in 1946. During the war, Loicq permitted W. G. Hardy of the CAHA and the International Ice Hockey Association to continue negotiating working agreements with the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States. The World Championship resumed in 1947, and Loicq completed one final year as president of the LIHG. He resigned during the 1947 congress after 25 years as president, and was succeeded by Fritz Kraatz from Switzerland. Hockey referee career Loicq officiated the match between Canada and the United States at the 1924 Winter Olympics. Loicq was an international ice hockey referee from 1924 to 1937, which coincided with his presidency of the LIHG. During this time he officiated at the Winter Olympic Games, Ice Hockey World Championships and the Ice Hockey European Championships. Some notable games for Loicq at the Olympics include the decisive match in ice hockey at the 1924 Winter Olympics, where Canada defeated the United States for the gold medal; the match between Canada and Sweden in ice hockey at the 1928 Winter Olympics; and the match between Canada and Austria in ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics. He worked at least 60 international matches during his career, and founded the International College of Referees to grow the talent pool of officials. Personal life and death Loicq's son Gaston played as a defenceman for CDP Bruxelles during the 1939‚Äì40 season. Paul Loicq died 26 March 1953, in Sint- Genesius-Rode, Belgium. Legacy and honors Loicq was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame (pictured) in 1961, which also hosts the IIHF Hall of Fame to which he was inducted in 1997. Loicq was named honorary president of the LIHG upon his resignation in 1947. He was posthumously voted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1960, and the Belgian Olympic Committee presented his widow with the Hall of Fame crest. He was formally inducted into the Hall of Fame's builder category in 1961. He became the first European to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, and is the only Belgian to be inducted as of 2019. Journalist Andy O'Brien said that, \\"Loicq personifies the justification for the shrine\\". Both O'Brien and the Canadian Press credited Loicq as the main person who introduced hockey to the Olympics. Loicq and 30 others were honored by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) in the inaugural class of inductees into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 1997. He was posthumously inducted at a ceremony in Helsinki, during the 1997 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. He was inducted into the builder's category, and is the only inductee from Belgium as of 2019. The IIHF Hall of Fame credits Loicq for growing the game of hockey in Europe and raising its worldwide profile through the foundation of the Ice Hockey World Championships and the Olympic Games competitions. The Hockey Hall of Fame states that Loicq was a \\"dedicated organizer\\" who spent a lifetime involved in the game, was \\"respected for his project management skills\\" and a \\"visionary\\" who was the \\"brain on the national and international scene\\". The IIHF established the Paul Loicq Award in 1998 to further recognize his legacy. The award is given to recognize an individual for outstanding contributions to the development of international ice hockey, and is handed out at the same time as the hall of fame induction. Royal Belgian Ice Hockey Federation president Pascal Nuchelmans said in 2013, that the federation wants to establish its own hall of fame which would include prominent recognition of Loicq. Nuchelmans also stated, \\"Loicq is the start of everything. He put Belgian hockey on the map\\", and that \\"Loicq contributed to the great strides that were made in increasing the sport throughout Europe in the 20th century\\".

It is the tenth episode of the second season and 22nd overall. It originally aired on March 25, 2007. Plot summary After losing the Battle of Actium, a vanquished Mark Antony barricades himself with Cleopatra in their palace in Alexandria. The palace becomes a place of endless debauchery as Mark Antony and Cleopatra host orgies while drugging and drinking themselves into a stupor. Octavian sends an emissary to Mark Antony, with a secret message to Lucius Vorenus, offering him amnesty if he will betray Antony and open the palace gates in an attempt to avoid a direct assault on the palace which might lead to a popular uprising. It is made clear that Titus Pullo is aware that Caesarion is his son and that Vorenus also knows this. Mark Antony refuses Octavian's offer of unconditional surrender and challenges Octavian to single combat. Vorenus also refuses to betray Mark Antony. Meanwhile, Mark Antony's physical condition continues to deteriorate along with his mental condition. When he spars with Vorenus, he is easily defeated. When a bystander accidentally laughs, Antony is enraged. He then challenges the bystander, quickly killing him. Octavian refuses the challenge as barbaric and secretly sends word to Cleopatra offering her the chance to keep the crown of Egypt and save the lives of her children if she gives up Mark Antony. She tricks Mark Antony into believing that she has committed suicide. Vorenus assists in Antony's suicide at his request. Vorenus, shocked to find Cleopatra still alive, tells her that Octavian will keep Mark Antony's children alive as a popular gesture of mercy but will almost certainly kill Caesarion as a potential rival to the rule of Rome; he also reveals his final orders from Mark Antony to escape with Caesarion to keep the boy alive. It is made clear that Cleopatra knows that Caesarion is actually Titus Pullo's son. Upon meeting Octavian and failing to seduce him as she had Mark Antony, Cleopatra realizes that he wishes to take her kingdom and parade her, alive but in chains, in Rome at his triumph. She commits suicide by clasping an asp to her breast, and as Octavian's soldiers storm her throne room, she dies, telling Octavian with her final breaths, \\"You have a rotten soul\\". Vorenus has meanwhile escaped the palace with Caesarion and Titus Pullo is charged by Octavian with finding and killing Caesarion. Vorenus and Pullo meet near where they had previously saved Cleopatra's life in the first season and they discuss plans to escape Egypt. At a Roman roadblock they appear to pass until a guard recognizes Caesarion and mocks him. Caesarion responds in anger revealing his true identity and a fight ensues. Although they manage to fight their way out, Vorenus is seriously (perhaps mortally) wounded. He demands that Titus Pullo take him to Rome to die. In Rome, Octavian arrives at his mother's house, bringing with him Cleopatra and Mark Antony's twin children, Cleopatra Selene and Alexander Helios who he asks Octavia to take under her care. Atia takes the news of Antony's death with satisfaction, but takes little pleasure in her son's success in at last gaining supreme power; Octavia is disturbed by Atia's mood. After a month-long journey, a badly injured Vorenus and Pullo return to Rome for an emotional reunion at the Collegium. On his sickbed, Vorenus is reconciled with his grieving children. Series creator Bruno Heller later revealed that Vorenus did not die after this scene. At the same time, Octavian's triumph is taking place. As Livia and Octavia are about to enter a podium in the Forum, late arrival Atia takes the lead, calling Livia a \\"vicious little trollop,\\" and says, \\"You're swearing now that some day you will destroy me, but remember that far better women than you have sworn to do the same. Go look for them now.\\"Referring to Servilia, for example, and to Livia's future murderous ambition that her son will succeed Augustus, known to TV audiences from I, Claudius. Atia's look, however, is ambiguous as she watches a triumphal float pass by with the effigies of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra, her lost love and his seducer, as glances are exchanged between Agrippa and Octavia. A month later, Pullo pays Octavian a visit, lying to him about the fate of Caesarion and is rewarded. He also tells him that Vorenus didn't survive his injuries without giving details on how they were inflicted. Leaving Octavian's palace, he meets Caesarion who begins swearing revenge in his wish to claim his rightful throne as Caesar's heir, \\"redeeming my father's name!\\" The series ends with the pair disappearing into a crowded Roman street as Titus Pullo puts his arm around Caesarion and says \\"Listen, about your father...\\" Cultural references and continuity * Akin to Caesar's death in the previous season, Mark Antony is depicted as covering his face when he is grieving over the \\"death\\" of Cleopatra. * Since the real Atia had died in 43 BC, her presence at the triumph of Octavian is fictional. Ratings The series finale of Rome was watched by 2.4 million viewers. Apart from the season premiere, this is the only episode in the second season with known viewership numbers.

It is a simple alternative to attaching a camera to a motorized equatorial mount. Astronaut Don Pettit operates a barn door tracker located in the Destiny lab of the International Space Station. He made the mount from spare parts he had accumulated from aboard the station. History The barn door tracker was created by George Haig. His plans were first published in Sky & Telescope magazine in April 1975. Modified versions of the tracker were published in the magazine's February 1988 and June 2007 editions. In late 2002 and early 2003, NASA astronaut Don Pettit, part of International Space Station Expedition 6, constructed a barn door tracker using spare parts he had accumulated from around the space station, permitting sharper high resolution images of city lights at night from the ISS. Mount design alternatives A simple single-arm barn door tracker can be made by attaching two pieces of wood together with a hinge. A camera is mounted on the top board, usually with some sort of ball joint to allow the camera to be pointed in any direction. The hinge is aligned with a celestial pole and the boards are then driven apart (or together) at a constant rate, usually by turning a threaded rod or bolt. This is called a tangent drive. This type of mount is good for approximately 5‚Äì10 minutes before tracking errors become evident when using a 50 mm lens. This is due to the tangent error. That length of time can be increased to about 20 minutes when using an isosceles mount. A curved drive bolt in lieu of either a straight tangent or isosceles mount will greatly extend the useful tracking time. These designs were further improved upon by Dave Trott, whose designs were published in the February 1988 issue of Sky & Telescope. By using a second arm to drive the camera platform - making fabrication slightly less simple - tracking accuracy is greatly increased, allowing exposure times of up to one hour. The most accurate of these designs is Type-4. A modified double arm design minimizes tangent error by raising the point of rotation of the arm on which the camera is mounted. This has the effect of tilting the arc traced by the camera arm backwards causing it to follow a better path. A basic geometrical analysis of the tangent error shows that it can be fully compensated for by inserting a specially shaped piece between the threaded rod and the top board. Such solution was already known for a long time before the original G. Haig publication.Andr√© Hamon in Astronomie, July/August 1953, translated in Sky & Telescope June 1978. The most basic of these designs are manually operated, even though an optional electric motor or stepper motor (considered in Trott's original design) automates and improves the accuracy of tracking, while considerably reducing the likelihood of platform vibrations that could result from manipulating the device; i.e., manually advancing the drive rod. Improved type 4 barn door tracker for astro photography Double arm (Type 4) design and building plans Reportedly, Dave Trott's two-arm Type 4 design can potentially reduce trailing error to 1 arc second per hour, allowing for very long trail-less exposures, even in combination with long (200mm +) lenses. However, detailed building plans have apparently never been published. Ideally, this drive requires a 1 RPM stepper motor on a 1/4\\" 20 pitch drive rod, but for shorter exposures on a stable platform (tripod), a well designed type-4 barn-door tracker is supposed to produce very acceptable results even when manually advancing the drive in 15 or 10 second sequential steps in order to achieve one full revolution per minute. Now, detailed 1:1 building plans for the design can be found here A key modification of the original design is the hinged suspension of the drive rod -- which avoids binding --, as well as a central tripod mount that can be moved along the supporting truss tubes to better balance for lighter or heavier loads according to their orientation. For proper polar alignment, a 3-way tripod or azimuth wedge is required. The latter is not included in the design plan.

He played college football at Boston College. Early years Widell attended South Catholic High School in Connecticut, where he originally played the trombone in the school band. In football, he played at tight end and nose tackle. He didn't start until his junior season. He received All-state honors at both positions as a senior. He also was the center for the basketball team. College career Widell accepted a football scholarship to play at Boston College. As a redshirt freshman, he was a backup at left tackle. He also was named the team's long snapper on special teams mid-way through the season. As a sophomore, he was part of a platoon at the center position. In his last 2 seasons, he was named the starter at right tackle. In 2003, he was inducted into the Boston College Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys Widell was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (94th overall) of the 1988 NFL Draft. He started at right tackle against the Pittsburgh Steelers while second-year player Kevin Gogan was serving a 30 day suspension, an became just the second rookie in franchise history to start a season opener at offensive tackle (Ralph Neely was the first). Later in the season, injuries to Mark Tuinei and Daryle Smith, allowed him to start 8 game at left tackle. In 1989, he started 2 contests at right tackle in place of an injured Gogan. From games 10 to 14, he was a part of a platoon with Gogan at right tackle, with Widell being used mostly on passing situations. He missed the season finale with a sprained right knee injury. On August 24, 1990, he was traded to the Denver Broncos in exchange for a seventh round selection in 1991 (#173-Leon Lett) and an eighth round selection in 1992 (#222-Mike Pawlawski). Denver Broncos In 1990, he joined his brother Doug Widell (who was also his teammate at Boston College) with the Denver Broncos, becoming the first brothers in the NFL's modern era to play together on the same offensive line. He appeared in all 16 games, serving as the long snapper for punts and started at left guard in the final 5 contests. In 1991, he started two games at left guard, including the season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. He replaced an injured Keith Kartz as the starting center for the playoff games against the Houston Oilers and the Buffalo Bills. In 1992, he appeared in all 16 games, starting the season opener at center against the Los Angeles Rams. He also was named the team's long snapper. In 1993, he started a total of 15 games. He started the first contests at left guard, the next five at center and five of the last six at left guard. He was declared inactive in the fifteenth game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was the team's long snapper on the punt unit. In 1994, he started all 16 games at center. Widell only missed one game with the Broncos, while playing at guard, tackle, center and long snapper. Jacksonville Jaguars On March 15, 1995, he signed as a free agent with the Jacksonville Jaguars, reuniting with Tom Coughlin, who was his offensive coordinator as a redshirt freshman in college. He was named the franchise's first starting center. In 1996, he appeared in 15 games with 14 starts at center. He missed 2 offensive snaps with a sprained knee for the first time as a Jaguar, during the second game against the Houston Oilers. He played the entire fifth game against the Carolina Panthers, despite having a torn meniscus in his right knee. He missed the next game against the New Orleans Saints, while recovering from knee surgery. He did not start in the seventh game against the New York Jets, but still took over at center in the second quarter. He played only in the first offensive series of the divisional playoff game against the Denver Broncos, after suffering a strained left calf, but still remained in the game as the long snapper on the special teams units. In 1997, he started at center for the first 8 games of the season, before being passed on the depth chart by Michael Cheever. He returned to the starting lineup in the thirteenth game to replace an injured Cheever. Atlanta Falcons On May 11, 1998, Widell signed as a free agent with the Atlanta Falcons, reuniting with Dan Reeves who was his head coach with the Denver Broncos. He was declared inactive in 14 games and played in only one contest. He was also a part of the Atlanta Falcons' Super Bowl XXXIII losing team. He was released on February 17, 1999.

He had co-owned the team from 1962 for ten seasons with his brother Charles Jr. and had been sole owner from 1972 until his death in 2019. The team has been owned by the Bidwell family since 1932. Charles Bidwill purchased the then-Chicago Cardinals for $50K (the equivalent of ~$918K in 2018). https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/07/16/arizona-cardinals-owner-bill-bidwill Early life and education Born in Chicago, Illinois, Bidwill and his elder brother Charles were adopted by Charles and Violet Bidwill, who were NFL team owners. Bidwill attended Georgetown Preparatory School, then enlisted in the U.S. Navy until 1956. He went to college at Georgetown University, and after his graduation, moved to St. Louis a few months before the Cardinals moved there. Professional sports=Chicago Cardinals Charles Bidwill purchased the team, then known as the Chicago Cardinals, from David Jones in 1933. After his death at age 51 in 1947,\\"Team History, Pro Football Hall of Fame his widow authorized business partner Ray Bennigsen to carry on management of the team. Violet Bidwill married St. Louis businessman Walter Wolfner in 1949 and he later became managing director. St. Louis Cardinals Prior to the 1960 season, Violet moved the Cardinals to St. Louis. Charles Jr. and Bill inherited the team after their mother's death in January 1962, and served as co-owners for ten seasons, until Bill purchased it outright in 1972. Among NFL franchises, only the Chicago Bears and New York Giants have been controlled by one family longer than the Cardinals. Arizona Cardinals Bidwill's ownership was marked by little success. In his years as at least part-owner, the Cardinals only made the playoffs eight times (1974, 1975, 1982, 1998, 2008, 2009, 2014, and 2015) and had only nine other winning seasons. He moved the team to Phoenix, Arizona prior to the 1988 season after St. Louis refused to build a new stadium to replace Busch Memorial Stadium. Bidwill had also publicly pledged to support a future effort to gain an expansion franchise for St. Louis. Instead, he voted to approve a new franchise in Jacksonville, Florida. However, St. Louis eventually gained a new franchise anyway, the relocated Los Angeles Rams in 1995. The Rams returned to Los Angeles in 2016. Bidwill had a reputation for running the Cardinals rather cheaply; the Cardinals had one of the lowest payrolls in the league for many years. Following the move to State Farm Stadium in 2006, the team began to spend more money. The increased revenue paid off in 2008, when the Cardinals won their division for the first time since 1975 (when the team was based in St. Louis), hosted a playoff game for only the second time in franchise history (the previous coming in 1947 as a Chicago team) and advanced to Super Bowl XLIII. They won two more division titles in 2009 and 2015. Personal life Bidwill ceded most day-to-day control over the Cardinals to his sons Michael and Bill Jr., who serve as team president and vice president, respectively. Bidwill also had two other sons, Patrick and Tim, and a daughter, Nicole. After the death of Ralph Wilson in March 2014, Bidwill became the longest-tenured owner in the NFL. Death Bidwill died at age 88 on October 2, 2019. At the time of his death, he was the longest tenured owner in the NFL.

At the time, it was affiliated with WBVI- TV, the predecessor of WMBB. It became WPFM on May 15, 1973, playing a beautiful music format until 1978. In 1978, the format was changed to a mix of Top 40 and Adult Contemporary. It was in this era of WPFM that they developed an equal following from both locals and tourists, and were known sponsors of big-name Spring Break events in the area. In 1992, after some months off the air due to legal issues, WPFM became exclusively Top 40, and rebranded to \\"Power 108\\". In September 1993, they began calling themselves \\"Kiss FM\\", which only lasted over a month. From then until 1995, they played alternative rock under the name \\"107.9 The Zone\\". In 1995, they went back to Top 40 under the name \\"Mix 108\\". WPFM and WDRK swapped formats on November 21, 1997. As a result, WPFM took WDRK's calls and active rock format, while the original WDRK changed their own to WMXP and adopted the \\"Mix\\" name, \\"Mix 103\\". The new \\"Rock 108\\" was ill-fated, and the calls were changed again on October 5, 1998 to WLHR. From this came the widely successful Top 40 station \\"Hot 107.9\\". WLHR was changed to WPFM-FM on March 10, 2004, before returning to the WPFM call sign (without the \\"-FM\\" suffix) on October 14, 2014. On September 21, 2018, Powell Broadcasting announced that it had sold WPFM to the Educational Media Foundation, but planned to keep \\"Hot 107.9\\" up until the end of the year. On October 14, 2018, four days after Hurricane Michael destroyed the facilities that housed WPFM, Powell Broadcasting announced that it had ceased the operations of all of its Panama City radio stations, citing \\"catastrophic\\" damage. This expedited EMF's decision to get K-Love on the air by just under a month. On December 4, 2018, WPFM signed on once again, this time under Educational Media Foundation's K-Love moniker, airing a contemporary Christian music format.

In the United States Navy, it is commonly and properly referred to as the flight deck. In the UK's Fleet Air Arm, landing on is usually achieved by first lining up on the port quarter parallel to the ship's heading, then once the deck motion is deemed to be acceptable the pilot sidesteps the aircraft laterally using a white painted line (the bum line) as a reference. Shipboard landing for some helicopters is assisted though use of a haul-down device that involves attachment of a cable to a probe on the bottom of the aircraft prior to landing. Tension is maintained on the cable as the helicopter descends, assisting the pilot with accurate positioning of the aircraft on the deck; once on deck locking beams close on the probe, locking the aircraft to the flight deck. This device was pioneered by the Royal Canadian Navy and was called \\"Beartrap\\". The U.S. Navy implementation of this device, based on Beartrap, is called the \\"RAST\\" system (for Recovery Assist, Secure and Traverse) and is an integral part of the LAMPS Mk III (SH-60B) weapons system. A secondary purpose of the haul-down device is to equalize electrostatic potential between the helicopter and ship. The whirling rotor blades of a helicopter can cause large electrical charges to build up on the airframe, large enough to cause injury to shipboard personnel should they touch any part of the helicopter as it approaches the deck. This was depicted in the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October, when Jack Ryan is flown out to a submarine by helicopter. Ryan is lowered to the submarine, but brushes the officer charged with trying to hook him who receives a minor injury. Coaxial rotor helicopters in flight are highly resistant to side-winds, which makes them suitable for shipboard use, even without a rope-pulley landing system. Marine and offshore helicopter decks on board offshore oil platforms and ships are typically regulated by the rules defined within CAP 437, which defines standards for the design, marking, and lighting of marine/offshore helicopter decks, and is produced by the Civil Aviation Authority.

Biography Trained as a violinist, he made his first violin on his own and received praise for it. Thus he decided to become a violin maker and moved to Milan to work with the Antoniazzi family in 1886. With them he established a partnership of exceptional importance, putting to good use his artistic skills and business ability. After having moved his workshop to various premises, he retired to his villa in Venegono leaving his sons Andrea and Carlo Bisiach to continue the business in Milan. Bisiach was a prominent figure in the commerce of antique violins. He trained a number of luthiers, including Gaetano Sgarabotto, Igino Sderci, Pietro Borghi, Ornati and Garimberti. His workshop can be considered as the most important in Italy in that period. The following instrument makers worked at Bisiach's: Riccardo Antoniazzi, Romeo Antoniazzi, Gaetano Sgarabotto, Giuseppe Ornati, Ferdinando Garimberti, Igino Sderci, Rocchi Sesto, Carlo Carletti, Cipriano Briani, Camillo Mandelli, Ferriccio Varagnolo, Camillo Colombo, Vincenzo Cavani, Pietro Paravicini, Albert Moglie, Andrea Bisiach, Carlo Bisiach, Pietro Borghi, Mirco Tarasconi, Leandro Jr. & Giacomo Bisiach, Iginio Siega and Carlo Ferrario. With the death of the last of the great Cremonese masters towards the end of the 18th century, only the Cerutis remained in Cremona. It was the Antoniazzis who undertook the task of transferring the scant knowledge saved from oblivion from Cremona to Milan. Leandro Bisiach did a great deal of research and found some old recipes, which he used to create antiqued varnishes for the numerous copies he made. He primarily used a varnish of a light red-orange color although it varied greatly from one instrument to another. To give an instrument an aged look he very often shaded off the varnish only at the base of the back plate. Bisiach used a large number of diverse models but principally those of Stradivari, Amatise and other models of Guarneri, Balestrieri, Guadagnini, Gagliano, Enrico and Giovanni Battista Ceruti or other violin makers from Veneto in the 18th century. He also utilized many others as chance would have it. Bisiach received various awards and recognition from exhibitions at Atlanta 1895-1896, Turin 1898, Paris 1900, Milan 1906 and Brussels 1910. \\"The shaping of the back, in Bisiach's instruments, can be identified by the accentuated hollowing out that emphasizes the border, which is rounded. The inlay has a large central white strip and two very narrow black threads, short and slightly closed corners, an echo of the Stradivarian style. The F holes are cleanly and precisely cut, while the columns of the ribs are clearly inspired by the classic Cremonese school. Bisiach's varnishes, usually a beautiful red-brown, have brilliant yellow-gold reflections.\\" - Pardo Fornaciari, Arte Liuteria Musicians who owned Leandro's instruments included American violinists Sebastian Campesi and Nathan Milstein. Quotes \\"The baron Andrea Paganini, grandson of the famous Niccolo, wrote a letter of thanks to Bisiach in 1839 for the repair in admirable style of his Stradivarius. Other clients included Sarasate, Joachim, and violincellist Alfredo Piatti, who trusted his violoncello (a Stradivarius, from which Bisiach made a reproduction) to no one else. This patriarch of violin making must have had a rather striking personality, if his own maestro, Riccardo Antoniazzi, to say nothing of Antoniazzi's father Gaetano and brother Romeo, joined the company that Bisiach had created in his own name.\\" - Pardo Fornaciari, Arte Liuteri \\"Leandro Bisiach began in his native town of Casale Monferrato, in 1886, and immediately transferred himself to Milan where, as student of Riccardo Antoniazzi, thanks to Antoniazzi's maestro Enrico Ceruti (1803-1883) and of his teacher, Claudio Storioni, he could claim more than just an imaginary affiliation with the great Cremonese school. In fact Storioni had been a student of Carlo Bergonzi, the only true custodian of the secrets of Stradivarius. We must say that Leandro Bisiach honoured his significant inheritance, which in actuality was not only symbolic. By one of those tricks of fortune that make one suspect the hand of destiny, Leandro senior had come into possession of tools and models that had belonged to the various old Cremonese masters. This seems strange enough in itself, a curious coincidence. In reality, he had much greater luck; among the documents and papers obtained by Fanny Rossi, the widow of Giacomo Stradivari (1822-1901), Bisiach found the most precious and extraordinary item imaginable, that is, the formula for the varnish of the great Antonio Stradivarius from 1704. In truth, it was not the only varnish of the eighteenth century that Bisiach could use. He had at hand another formula used first by Giovan Battista Ceruti (1755-1817) and later by two other generations of the same family. In addition, in 1929 he gained possession of a collection of documents attributed to Stradivarius, among which he found another formula that dated back to the great Cremonese.\\" - Pardo Fornaciari, Arte Liuteria \\"Leandro Bisiach did a great deal of research and found some old recipes. The varnish on the instruments from his best period is very beautiful; of transparent and flexible quality. He primarily used a light red-orange color although it varied greatly from one instrument to another. He had a special talent for creating \\"antiqued\\" varnishes for the numerous \\"copies\\" he made. To give it the old look he very often shaded off the varnish only at the base of the back plate. He used a large number of diverse models but principally those of Stradivari, Amatise and other models of Guarneri, Balestrieri, Guadagnini, Gagliano, Ceruti or other violin makers from Veneto (Venice) in the 18th century. He also utilized many others as chance would have it.\\" - Eric Blot \\"Leandro was one of the most influential violin makers and dealers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He won important recognition and prizes in International exhibitions in London (1895), Atlanta (1895-96), Turin (1898), Paris (1900), Milan (1906), and Brussels (1910), and in 1905 opened and successfully ran a workshop that can be compared to the great workshops of J.B.

(photo: R.Kanoff)  History = Early Nursing Education at UCLA  UCLA, a public research university in Los Angeles, was founded in 1919. Nursing education at UCLA dates back to 1929. In the early days, registered nurses received certificates in public health offered through university extension courses. In 1932 a group of public health nurses advocated for a Department of Nursing Education to be established in the College of Letters and Science. Dr. Elinore Beebe, RN, PhD, recruited from Yale, became the first director of the UCLA Public Health Nursing program under the Department of Bacteriology in 1937. The 1940s was a time of reorganization and growth for the program. The Bachelor of Science degree was established within a new College of Applied Arts. In 1946 the Department of Public Health Nursing became the Department of Nursing, with faculty added to develop courses to prepare nursing supervisors.  Establishing a School of Nursing  Professor Lulu K. Wolf (later Hassenplug) from Vanderbilt University was recruited to develop a nursing school at UCLA. Wolf had graduated with honors in 1924 from the Army School of Nursing, Walter Reed Hospital, and earned her BS from Columbia University Teachers' College in 1927. In 1949 the University of California Regents (UC Regents) authorized the School of Nursing as one of the professional schools of the UCLA Centers for the Health Sciences, and Wolf was appointed the school's first dean. This action paved the way in 1950 for the opening of an undergraduate traditional program in nursing leading to the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree and the establishment of a graduate program leading to the Master of Science (MS) degree in nursing the following year. In 1966 the Master of Nursing (MN) degree was established as an alternate option to the MS degree. The MS degree program was discontinued in 1969. Meanwhile, in the 1960s, the school hosted and participated in international programs with many countries around the world including Columbia, Egypt, Hong Kong, India, and Japan, which led to an increase in the number of international students. The Regents approved the Doctor of Nursing Science (DNSc) degree program in 1986, and in 1987 the first doctoral students were admitted. In the mid-1990s, the master's degree designation MN was changed to Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), and the doctoral degree designation DNSc was changed to PhD in Nursing. In 1993 admissions to the bachelor's program was suspended and the last class graduated in 1997. In its place, the Bridge program was introduced to meet the educational needs of students who are registered nurses with associate degrees or diplomas in nursing. In 2006 the school reinstated a traditional / prelicensure BS program with admission at the freshman level and launched the Master's Entry Clinical Nurse (MECN) / prelicensure program option within the MSN degree program, which is designed for prelicensure students with bachelor's degrees or higher education in another discipline. The UCLA School of Nursing is approved by the Undergraduate and Graduate Councils of the Academic Senate of the University of California at Los Angeles. In addition, the prelicensure (BS and MECN) and advanced practice master's programs are approved by the California Board of Registered Nursing. In 2011 the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) accredited the existing bachelor's and master's degree programs for a term of 10 years, the highest that can be granted. UCLA holds Western Association of Schools and Colleges accreditation.  Academics / Degree Programs  The UCLA School of Nursing offers five degree programs including Bachelor of Science (a pre-licensure program for undergraduate study), MSN ‚Äì Master's Entry Clinical Nurse (for those with a baccalaureate degree in another discipline who desire a career in nursing), Master of Science in Nursing ‚Äì Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (for nurses with a bachelor's degree in nursing), Doctor of Philosophy (for individuals who wish to pursue a research trajectory), and Doctor of Nursing Practice. Education is provided in both classroom and clinical settings. In addition to degree programs, the school offers summer research programs and accepts applications from all qualified nursing students with junior status from any undergraduate institution in the United States. The eight-week program is designed for students who plan to pursue a PhD degree and enter academic careers in nursing. Research areas include Biobehavioral Sciences, Biologic Sciences, Health Disparities/Vulnerable Populations, and Health Services Research.  Research  UCLA School of Nursing scholars represent a wide range of disciplines including nursing, medicine, public health, statistics, epidemiology, physiological sciences, and the basic sciences. All are committed to scholarship in the service of improving health, wellness, and quality of life throughout the lifespan. Some examples of faculty research include: *The impact of heart failure and sleep apnea on brain function *Screening, prevention, assessment and management of pressure ulcers and wound care *Cellular targets for Alzheimer's treatments or prevention *Gene therapy that has high potential to advance the science in HIV/AIDS *Nutritional strategies to increase fertility *Cardiovascular impact from hookah smoking  Research Centers of Excellence  * Center for Vulnerable Populations Research (CVPR) * Center for American Indian/Indigenous Research and Education (CAIIRE) * Center for the Advancement of Gerontological Nursing Science (AGNS)  Rankings  Ranked #20 on the U.S. News Best Grad School Rankings: Best Nursing Schools: Master's (for 2019-2020).

Plot Astronomer Professor Thongchai and his assistant Sek observe some meteorites falling and determine they struck somewhere in Southern Thailand. They head for Ranong Province where they start their investigation at a potash mine owned by Luang Kosit. When they arrive, they find the place under siege by some gunmen. Sek pitches in to help out, and to return the favor, Luang Kosit brings Thongchai and Sek to his home and offers them a place to stay. Luang Kosit's daughter is Chonlada and she thinks she can help Sek determine where the meteorites fell. They contact the local \\"sea clan\\", where Chonlada had made friends with the chief's daughter, Sarai. Meanwhile, a male friend of Chonlada's becomes jealous of her time spent with Sek, and while lamenting over the situation with some other friends, the group breaks out into song to chide him, while he voices his heartfelt desires. At night on the sea clan island, the chief goes to pray to the goddess Kali on a cliff overlooking the sea. As he departs, he is attacked by a blob-shaped, tentacled creature that has a large glowing green eye. Possessed by the alien, the chief returns to his village, and with green ray beams emanating from his glowing green eyes, he kills everyone. The next day, Sek, Chonlada and others from the mainland take a boat to the sea clan island. On the way there, another song is performed. Initially they think the village is mysteriously deserted, but upon further investigation they find only the skeletons of the villagers. The party decides the burn the village, however Sarai is still alive. Some drama ensues as she is trapped in the fire and Chonlada and the other men rush to her rescue, and then bring her to the mainland. The next night, the alien creature finds its way to the mainland and attacks a young couple, who then turn their death-ray eye beams on others. Various ways are tried to kill the alien-possessed people, but they are impervious to bullets and flame. Professor Thongchai examines a sample of the alien under a microscope, and eventually it is noticed that exposure to sunlight kills the creature. This explains the creature only attacking at night. It is then discovered that the alien has taken up residence in a nearby cave, so it is decided that the cave should be dynamited to close up the entrance. More drama ensues as Chonlada and Serei go into the cave just as it is to be sealed, and Sek and another man need to scuba dive in to rescue them through an ocean entrance. Trapped in the cave with the alien creature, Serei is angry and wants revenge against the alien for killing her father and wiping out her village. She tries to attack it, but is vaporized by its green ray beam. Sek and another man arrive to help Chonlada escape, and the other man is killed. Cut off from their escape route, Sek and Chonlada face certain doom, but then Sek finds a mirrored, metal shield and discovers it deflects the alien's death ray. He goads the creature into firing at him, directing the ray towards the roof of the cave. Eventually, the beams break through, and sunlight pours in, killing the alien. Production Released in 1971, Out of the Darkness was the first science fiction film produced in the Thai film industry, and its production standards were crude compared to other sci-fi films and television series being made in the era. \\"It was terrible,\\" director Chatrichalerm Yukol admitted in a 1994 interview. It was also his first film. \\"I was in television before I started in film. And then, I made a film called Out of the Darkness, just for fun, because no science fiction film had ever been made in Thailand. I was thinking about what if some of the ETs would come down in Thailand.\\" DVD A DVD of the film was released in Thailand on an all-region, PAL disc with English subtitles by the Mangpong video retail chain.

Royal Commissions are a major independent public inquiry into an issue, initiated by the Australian Government. They often investigate cases of political corruption or matters of significant public concern. A Royal Commissioner or panel of Royal Commissioners, is appointed by letters patent to preside over the commission of inquiry. The Commissioner has considerable powers, generally greater than those of a judge. However, the powers of the Commissioner are restricted to the terms of reference of the commission handed down by the Governor-General in the letters patent. Once a Commission has started the government cannot end it, and thus the government is usually very careful in framing the terms of reference, and may place a time limit for an inquiry. The terms of reference may be amended and the time for an inquiry may be extended, at the government's discretion. Legislation The Royal Commissions Act 1902 received Royal Assent on 8 August 1902. The Act allows the Governor-General to issue letters patent in the name of the Crown for a Commission of Inquiry. Specifically, the Act grants the Governor-General the power to make or authorise any inquiry, or to issue any commission to make any inquiry. The terms of reference of the inquiry must relate to the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth, any public purpose or any power of the Commonwealth.Royal Commissions Act 1902, section 1A The legislation provides that a Royal Commissioner has the power to issue a summons to a person to appear before the Commission at a hearing, to give evidence or to produce documents or other things specified in the summons. The Commission has a discretion whether it will require a person appearing at a hearing to take an oath or give an affirmation to tell the truth. A person served with a summons or a notice to produce documents must comply with that requirement, or face prosecution for an offence. The penalty for conviction upon such an offence is two years imprisonment. However, the Act excuses the penalty for failing to attend if a reasonable excuse can be provided (self-incrimination is not a reasonable excuse, however, as statements or documents tended by witnesses are not admissible in evidence against the witness). A Royal Commission may authorise the Australian Federal Police to execute search warrants. Notable Royal Commissioners * Terence Cole, who presided over the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry (2001 2003) and also presided over the Cole Inquiry into certain Australian companies in relation to the UN Oil- For-Food Programme (2005 2006) * H.

Still very relevant in medical study and practice, they are: #Obscurity: Asher endorses the use of clear communication and plain language whether writing or speaking. Obscurity may be used to cloak one's own ignorance, or due to an inability to communicate with those outside of the medical profession. \\"If you don't know, don't admit it. Instead, try to confuse your listeners.\\" is not uncommon. Regardless of the intention, whether to misdirect from incompetence or to foster a feeling of superiority, the patient and those surrounding them are often left confused and uncertain. #Cruelty: This sin is perhaps one of the most common perpetrations committed by physicians and medical students. Whether it be the physical thoughtlessness of a half-dozen students palpating a painful tumor mass, or loudly taking (or presenting) a patient's history in a crowded room, one of the first things that is unlearnt by a medical professional is to treat the patient as they themselves would like to be treated. #Bad Manners: Often overlooked, rudeness or poor taste in humour is condoned within the hospital setting. At the end of the day, many physicians and students are simply rude to patients that do not suit them. Whether it is a snapping at an uncooperative patient or making a cruel joke about them after leaving the room, the impact of these \\"coping mechanisms\\" (as they are considered to be by many) must be taken into account. #Over-Specialisation: In a growing trend by the medical establishment, over-specialisation and under- generalisation is a growing problem in the wider medical community. Ignoring aspects of one's education in favor of more interesting aspects is a behaviour that is pathological and outright negligent in a student. Failure to diagnose or to treat a patient because \\"their signs and differential fall outside of my field, let's turf them to another service\\" ought be a seriously considered Supervisory & Training issue. #Love of the Rare: (aka \\"If you hear hoof-beats, think horses. Not zebras\\") The desire for rare and interesting diseases causes many medical students and young physicians to seek the bizarre rather than seeing a mundane diagnosis. #Common Stupidity: As well as the standard definition for this sin, the specific example of \\"using empirical procedures rather than tailoring for the patient\\" or the young physician \\"flying on autopilot\\" must be mentioned. Ordering another test that is redundant, and for which the results may already be interpreted from the history, before starting treatment is such a situation. For example: requesting a haemoglobin count before beginning transfusion, despite the fact that the patient appears obviously anaemic. #Sloth: Laziness. Also includes ordering excessive numbers of tests, rather than simply taking the time to take an adequate history. For further information see Bruce Rowat's essay.

The Coroner's Court of South Australia is a court which has exclusive jurisdiction over the remains of a person and the power to make findings in respect of the cause of death of a person or fire in South Australia, a state of Australia. History The office of coroner in New South Wales derives from the legal framework inherited from the United Kingdom. The first Governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip, was a coroner by virtue of his commission as governor. As South Australia was formerly part of New South Wales, technically, Phillip would have been its first coroner. Structure and Jurisdiction At common law, coroners would constitute a court by virtue of their office. In South Australia, this common law position has been abolished and there is now the Coroners Court of South Australia established. Coroners have the power to investigate the causes of death within their jurisdiction. They also have power to retain a person‚Äôs remains, order autopsies, and direct how a person‚Äôs remains may be disposed of. South Australian coroners have jurisdiction to hold inquests concerning the cause of any fire in the state if the State Coroner or the South Australian Attorney General is of the view that an inquest should be held. Where a serious criminal offence has been disclosed during the course of an inquest, the coroner cannot proceed with it if a person is to be charged with that criminal offence. There may be a right of appeal from the findings of a coroner to the Supreme Court of South Australia. State Coroners The Governor of South Australia may appoint a State Coroner for South Australia. The State Coroner has the function to oversee and co- ordinate coronial services in South Australia, ensure that all deaths and suspected deaths concerning which a coroner has jurisdiction to hold an inquest are properly investigated, and ensuring that an inquest is held whenever it is required, and to issue guidelines to coroners to assist them in the exercise or performance of their functions. All magistrates are deputy state coroners by virtue of their office.section 5 Coroners Act 2005 The State Coroner may delegate his or her functions to a suitable person.

He graduated from the 31st class of the Army Staff College in 1934. From 1934‚Äì1936, he was assigned as military attach√© to Turkey. On his return to Japan, he served for a year as an instructor at the Army War College before being reassigned to serve as Chief of the 4th Section of the 2nd Bureau of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, where he was (despite his fluency in the Russian language) in charge of collecting and analyzing military intelligence reports from Europe and North America.Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia With the outbreak of the Second Sino- Japanese War in 1937, he was assigned briefly to be commander of the IJA 45th Infantry Regiment, but soon returned to a staff position as Chief of the 1st Section (and later Chief of the 1st Bureau) of the powerful Inspectorate General of Military Training.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II In 1941, he was promoted to Lieutenant general and commander of the IJA 6th Division, which was initially assigned to China, and fought at the Third Battle of Changsha. The division was later transferred to the Solomon Islands from 1943‚Äì1945. He was second-in-command of the IJA 17th Army under General Harukichi Hyakutake during the initial period of the Bougainville campaign, and (as lieutenant general) later took command of the 17th Army after Hyakutake suffered a stroke in 1945.

She was one of a small group of dedicated Quakers who founded Swarthmore College. She was a contemporary and friend of Lucretia Mott and had many of Mott's sympathies but did not actively pursue the women's rights cause, rather she was a proponent of liberal Quaker spirituality. Early years Deborah Fisher was born into a wealthy Philadelphia Quaker family. Her grandfather was Joshua Fisher, who was involved in early transatlantic trade and started the first packet line of ships regularly carrying goods between Philadelphia and London. Her father was Samuel R Fisher, who took on the shipping business and a large mercantile business in downtown Philadelphia. Her mother was Hannah Rodman, of a Quaker family from Newport, RI, also associated with shipping. She was a descendant of Thomas Cornell. Deborah Fisher Wharton, in 1817 the year she was married. Family, estate Fisher grew up in downtown Philadelphia at 110 S Front Street. The neighborhood was busy and wealthy, and she remembered seeing famous neighbors including George Washington stroll along the street. The family enjoyed the countryside and often visited their country estate called \\"The Cliffs\\" several miles north of Philadelphia on the Schuylkill River. Marriage As a young woman Fisher was pious and interested in the cause of equal education and treatment of women. She married William Wharton in 1817 and together they pursued their interest in Quaker spirituality and simplicity, becoming part of the Hicksite Quaker movement. The Hicksite Friends favored simplicity and directness in their daily lives, contrasting with the more \\"worldly\\" urban (Orthodox) Quakers. In this respect the Fishers and Whartons stood out because they were wealthy and urban, but were nostalgic about living the farming life. Deborah's father Samuel bought a house at 336 Spruce Street in downtown Philadelphia as a wedding gift. Deborah raised her family in the house and lived there the rest of her life. Religious and social causes Deborah and William and were involved in Quaker Meeting affairs including many committees. Deborah was recognized by their Meeting at Ninth and Spruce Streets as a minister. She was involved in many causes, including helping the Indians of upper New York state, the anti-slavery movement, and education of children. She defended Indians' rights in Washington DC, and visited their reservations. Deborah and William successfully petitioned the city of Philadelphia to provide free education for blacks. William became one of the first directors of the Public Schools of Philadelphia and served in that capacity for twenty years. Bellevue William and Deborah received a gift of the Bellevue estate from his father Charles Wharton in 1834, the year that her father died. It was a farm near the Cliffs estate that she had grown up to love. The Whartons and their children spent many happy summers at Bellevue, where they enjoyed the vegetable gardens, horse-drawn carriage trips and the cool of the nearby Schuylkill River. Newport, Rhode Island Wharton's mother, Hannah Rodman Fisher, came from a long line of Quaker families from Rhode Island and Massachusetts. During the Revolution years, the Narragansett Bay area became a battleground between the British and the Americans allied with the French, and the Newport economy suffered. After the war, Hannah Rodman married Samuel R Fisher of Philadelphia and raised her family there. Although Deborah was a Philadelphian, she made the trip back to Newport many times, in later years with her children and grandchildren. A Newport family gathering in 1884.

Education and Swarthmore Like many women of her time, Deborah Fisher Wharton was kept at home by her duties as mistress of a large household and mother of ten children. But like most Quaker women of the time, she was especially interested in education. Deborah, together with a small group of other Hicksite Quakers from New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore was a founder of Swarthmore College, one of the first coeducational colleges in the country, and served on the original Board of Managers. Deborah Fisher Wharton's family prospered. Her daughter Esther married Benjamin R. Smith, the son of educator Daniel B Smith of Philadelphia. Fisher's son, industrialist Joseph Wharton became renowned for building a large business empire that included refining zinc, nickel, and iron.

The theory suggests that early in a product's life-cycle all the parts and labor associated with that product come from the area where it was invented. After the product becomes adopted and used in the world markets, production gradually moves away from the point of origin. In some situations, the product becomes an item that is imported by its original country of invention. A commonly used example of this is the invention, growth and production of the personal computer with respect to the United States. The model applies to labor-saving and capital-using products that (at least at first) cater to high-income groups. In the new product stage, the product is produced and consumed in the US; no export trade occurs. In the maturing product stage, mass-production techniques are developed and foreign demand (in developed countries) expands; the US now exports the product to other developed countries. In the standardized product stage, production moves to developing countries, which then export the product to developed countries. The model demonstrates dynamic comparative advantage. The country that has the comparative advantage in the production of the product changes from the innovating (developed) country to the developing countries. Product life-cycle Raymond Vernon divided products into three categories based on their stage in the product life cycle and how they behave in the international trade market: ''' * New Product * Maturing Product * Standardized Product There are five stages in a product's life cycle in respect to the Product Life Cycle Theory: *Introduction * Growth * Maturity * Saturation * Abandonment The location of production depends on the stage of the cycle. According to International Product Life Cycle theory there are five phases which describe how a product matures and declines as a result of internationalization: ¬∑Local Innovation ¬∑Overseas Innovation ¬∑Maturity ¬∑World Wide Imitation ¬∑Reversal Stage 1: Introduction This is where the new product is introduced to the market, the customers are unaware about the product. To create demand, producers promote the new product to stimulate sales. At this stage, profits are low but starts increasing and there are few competitors. As more units of the product sell, it enters the next stage automatically. For example, a new product invented in the United States for local consumers is first produced in the United States because that is where the demand is, and producers want to stay close to the market to detect consumer response. Characteristics of the product and the production process are in a state of change during this stage as firms familiarize themselves with the product and the market. No international trade takes place. Stage 2: Growth In this stage, demand for the product increases sales. As a result, production costs decrease and profits are high. The product becomes widely known and competitors enter the market with their own version of the product. To attract as many consumers as possible, the company that developed the original product increases promotional spending. When many potential new customers have bought the product, it enters the next stage Stage 3: Maturity In the maturity stage of the Product life cycle, the product is widely known and many consumers own it. In the maturity phase of the product life cycle, demand levels off and sales volume increases at a slower rate. There are several competitors by this stage and the original supplier may reduce prices to maintain market share and support sales. Profit margins decrease, but the business remains attractive because volume is high and costs, such as for development and promotion, are also lower. In addition, foreign demand for the product grows, but it is associated particularly with other developed countries, since the product is catering to high-income demands. For instance, in the case of the newly invented product, this rise in foreign demand (assisted by economies of scale) leads to a trade pattern whereby the United States exports the product to other high-income countries. Other developments also occur in the maturing product stage. Once the American firm is selling to other high-income countries, it may begin to assess the possibilities of producing abroad in addition to producing in the United States. With a plant in France, for example, not only France but other European countries can be supplied from the French facility rather than from the U.S. plant. Thus, an initial export surge by the United States is followed by a fall in U.S. exports and a likely fall in U.S. production of the goods. Stage 4: Saturation  It is a stage in which there is neither increase nor decrease in the volume of sale. Through modification in the attribute of the product is needed to attract new consumers. Competitors product at this stage would have started gaining its market share Stage 5: Decline By this time in the product‚Äôs life cycle, the characteristics of the product itself and of the production process are well known; the product is familiar to consumers and the production process to producers. This occurs when the product peaks in the maturity stage and then begins a downward slide in sales. Eventually, revenues drop to the point where it is no longer economically feasible to continue making the product. Investment is minimized. The product can simply be discontinued, or it can be sold to another company. Production may shift to the developing countries. Labor costs again play an important role, and the developed countries are busy introducing other products. For instance, the trade pattern shows that the United States and other developed countries have now started importing the product from the developing countries. On costs and revenues: Low production costs and a high demand ensures a longer product life. When production costs are high and demand is low, it is not offered on the market for a long time and, eventually, is withdrawn from the market in the '‚Äòdecline'‚Äô stage. Note that a particular firm or industry (in a country) stays in a market by adapting what they make and sell, i.e., by riding the waves. ReferencesFurther reading *Appleyard, Dennis R. Alfred J.

It belonged to the family Bauriidae. Bauria was probably a carnivore or insectivore. It lived in South Africa, specifically in the Burgersdorp Formation in South Africa. Bauria was named by Robert Broom in 1909 and found at Winnaarsbaken, South Africa. The first species Broom discovered, Bauria cynops, was a reasonably complete skull, but according to the first description somewhat poorly preserved, and apparently equally poorly prepared. Five other specimens were later found at different points in time, with mostly skulls being found. Only two species of Bauria are known, with the most recent one, Bauria robusta, being discovered by J. W. Kitching in 1955 in the Burghersdorp district In a recent paper, it has been found that Microgomphodon oligocynus and Bauria cynops are recognized as the only valid species of southern African bauriids.Fernando et. al. \\"New Material of Microgomphodon oligocynus (Eutherapsida, Therocephalia) and the Taxonomy of Southern African Bauriidae\\" (2013). Bauria Bauria cynops skull restoration, specimen 5622 Phylogeny Based on Brink's analysis of skull and lower jaw features in 1963, Bauria is a therapsid sufficiently different from Scaloposaurus and its allies to warrant distinction at the infraorder level. It was suggested that a suborder be recognized level with Gorgonopsia, Therocephalia, Cynodontia and Ictidosauria and that this suborder be called Scaloposauria. The suborder Scaloposauria should be divided into two infraorders, the earlier Ictodosuchoidea and the later Bauriamorpha, a natural branch separate from the suborder Cynodontia. Bauria was later confirmed to be a sister taxon of cynodonts, followed by an outgroup formed by (Moschorhinus (Ictidosuchops, Theriognathus)), using techniques involving Most Parsimonious Trees.Abdala, Fernando. \\"Redescritpion of Platycraniellus elegans (Therapsida, Cynodontia) from the Lower Triassic of South Africa, and the Cladistic Relationships of Eutheriodonts.\\" (2007). Most therocephalian genera lack an ectepicondylar foramen, with Bauria being the only exception, making Bauria a derived genera.King, G.M. \\"A description of the skeleton of a bauriid therocepahalian from the early Triassic of South Africa.\\" Annals of the South African Museum (1996).  Description  The diet of Bauria is assumed to have included tough fibrous material due to the way the anterior edge of an upper tooth shears against the posterior edge of the corresponding lower tooth to generate a cutting action. The cheek bulges, and the wide and deep depression below them, suggest a muscular arrangement associated with the corners of the mouth, whereby it is possible for such an animal to pull the corners of the mouth forwards as is characteristic of mammals, while in true reptiles the corners of the mouth are fixed and very close to the articulation of the lower jaw. This is a significant arrangement, because even with a secondary palate an animal would not be able to suck unless the corners of the mouth can be brought forward, allowing the mouth as a whole to close properly around the teat of a milk gland.  Paleobiology =Skull Structure According to what Brink compiled, the basioccipital of Bauria contributes in the typical therocephalian-scaloposaurid manner to the occipital condyle. In Bauria, the three exoccipitals are of equal size. The shape of the rest of the basioccipital in ventral view doesn't differ too much from other related forms like Ictidosuchops. The opisthotic contribution is visible in ventral view. There is the presence of bosses on the exoccipitals, dorsally and laterally, which mark the areas of articulation of the proatlas. The parietals form a parietal crest, in contrast with the slightly broader, more rounded ictidosuchoid condition. The fronto-parietal suture is narrow in Bauria, which differs from ictidosuchids who have a generally broader region Brink, A.S. \\"A New Ictidosuchid (Scaloposauria) From the Lystrosaurus-Zone.\\" (1965). The pineal foramen is absent, a feature of considerable significance at this critical level near the threshold of homoiotherm mammals. The postorbitals are very characteristic, making it possible to identify Bauria on one isolated postorbital bone. The posterior extensions flanking the parietals do not extend upward, the postorbital frontal sutures form no ridges, unlike in ictidosuchoids. Jaw Structure The dentary is peculiarly curved, making it a characteristic of this genus. The peculiar twist is designed to swing the posterior lower cheek teeth inward to ensure proper occlusion on the upper teeth. The dentary is greatly thickened, both internally and externally along the series of cheek teeth, much more than the transversely broadened teeth and their roots demand. The posterior part of the dental row is displaced inward so the dorsal margin of the coronoid process descends some distance laterally to the hindmost teeth and continues down and forward across the lateral face of the dentary virtually to the chin. This arrangement gives the dentary a very mammal-like or ictidosaur appearance, but the coronoid process is by contrast typically scaloposaurid. It reaches far back and high through the temporal vacuity, but as a long slender extension, somewhat square terminally. There are three large incisors, one short canine only slightly larger than the incisors, and it would appear that the cheek teeth normally count one more than in the upper jaw. The lower teeth are narrower than the upper teeth, but are still distinctly transversely ovate. All the teeth in the series are twice as wide as their antero-posterior measurement. The therocephalian Bauriashows a more complex postcanine crown pattern, but only one cusp can be seen in labial view Botha et. al. \\"The oldest cynodont: new clues on the origin and early diversification of the Cynodontia.\\" Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society (2007).Crompton, AW. \\"On the dentition and tooth replacement in two bauriamorph reptiles.\\" Annals of South African Museum (1962).  Species  There have only been two known species of Bauria that have been discovered so far, with the first species, Bauria cynops, being known from 6 different skulls in varying conditions of poor to excellent. The second species, Bauria robusta is known from a skull that is as much as twenty percent larger than the largest know specimen of Bauria cynops, which is about fifteen percent larger than the average of all other specimens of this genotype. The skull was unfortunately not well preserved, due to exposure to weathering. The only tangible evidence of a feature which is quite apparent to the eye is the fact that the snout appears to stouter, higher and shorter than in Bauria cynops. The cheek bulges in other Bauria specimens are below the anterior borders of the orbits, while in the new species they rise to a position more directly in from of the orbits.

North and South Vietnam (1954-1976). The Red River Delta in Northern Vietnam is the traditional homeland of the ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh people) where various Bronze Age cultures such as Phung Nguyen and Dong Son originated over 4000 years ago. Through migration and conquests, Vietnamese people gradually spread south in a process called Nam Ti·∫øn (Advancing South). Central Vietnam was home to Cham people, a Malayo-Polynesian ethnic group who founded their distinct Indianised Kingdom over the Central Coast before being subdued by the Vietnamese during the 14th century. Their predecessors, people who are now known as the Sa Huynh culture, dated back from 1000 BCE. The Mekong Delta in southernmost Vietnam was part of Funan, Chenla then Angkor Empire. Chinese and Vietnamese started migrating en masse to this region during the 16th to 17th century. Northern and Southern Vietnam was a fluid concept that changed constantly during the course of history. During the L√™‚ÄìM·∫°c wars (1541‚Äì92), Vietnam was partitioned with the M·∫°c dynasty holding the Red River Delta and L√™ dynasty controlling the Central Region from Ngh·ªá An to B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh while Champa and the Khmers still held their polities further south. During the Tr·ªãnh‚ÄìNguy·ªÖn War (1627‚Äì73), the country was partitioned between two ruling Lords with the border being the Gianh River in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province. The North, called ƒê√†ng Ngo√†i (Outer Realm) was ruled by the Tr·ªãnh Lords and Nguy·ªÖn lords in the South, called ƒê√†ng Trong (Inner Realm) or Qu·∫£ng Nam Qu·ªëc, with L√™ emperors still nominally acting as head of state. The two sides ruled their own domain independent of the other, and frequently fought each other. The imposed separation encouraged the two regions to develop their own cultures. After the Tay Son Wars (1770‚Äì1802) and the founding of the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty, the country started getting the present shape with the center of power now switched to Hu·∫ø in Central Vietnam. During French colonialism, the French divided the country into three parts, directly ruling over Cochinchina (southern Vietnam) while establishing protectorates in Annam (central Vietnam) and Tonkin (northern Vietnam). Consequently, Cochinchina was more directly influenced by French culture than the other two regions. Hanoi, being the capital of French Indochina, was the only place in Northern Vietnam with significant French influence. From 1954 to 1976, Vietnam was again divided into two separate countries,it divided by the B·∫øn H·∫£i River in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province at the 17th parallel. The North, ruled by a communist government, was allied with communist China and the Soviet Union, while the South had a free- market economy, quasi-democratic government, nationalist ideology and had contact with the United States, the West and Western-aligned nations. Although the nation has been united since 1976, linguistic, cultural, and other differences serve to delineate the two regions from one another, with accompanying stereotypes. The largest city in the North is Hanoi, the nation's capital; and the country's economic capital and largest city in the South today is Ho Chi Minh City (formerly called Saigon). Cultural differences The cultural differences between the regions can be divided into two main categories: \\"tangible\\" cultural differences such as traditional clothing, cuisine, and so on; and \\"intangible\\" cultural differences dealing with stereotypes of behavior, attitude and such between the people of these two regions. Discussions of inherent differences between people in the North and in the South are prohibited and can be classified as \\"reactionary\\" in Vietnamese state-controlled media or undermining national unity. Perceived traits and stereotypes While relations between northerners and southerners are generally civil, the increased contact due to the influx of northerners into the south since the start of the Vietnam War have given rise to some stereotypes about people from different regions: * Northerners, especially Hanoians, tend to view themselves as more cultured and refined. * Southerners consider themselves more dynamic and tolerant. * Northerners are more concerned about status and appearances. * Southerners are more liberal with their money while Northerners are more thrifty. * Northerners are more conservative and afraid of change, while Southerners are more dynamic. * Southerners are more westernized, while northerners are more communist- influenced * Southerners are more direct while northerners are more formal. Northerners employ a great deal of formalities, metaphors and sarcasm even in their daily speech. Therefore, some southerners say they have difficulty understanding northerners. Cuisine Cuisine is one of the cultural differences between the regions. Northern Vietnam being the \\"cradle\\" of ethnic Vietnamese civilization, bears many of Vietnam's signature dishes (such as ph·ªü and B√∫n ch·∫£ c√°). The cuisine is perceived to be complex in ingredients but simplistic in flavours. The South's cuisine has been influenced by the cuisines of southern Chinese immigrants and indigenous Cambodians, and thus Southerners prefer sweet and sour flavors, respectively, in many dishes. Examples of sour-flavored food items include Canh chua and green mango salad/green papaya salad. Southern cookery also tend to use a significantly larger variety of fresh ingredients while Northern cuisine much relies on preserved and dried goods. The cuisines of Southern Vietnam and Cambodia also share considerable similarities in ingredients, cooking style and food dishes, such as H·ªß ti·∫øu Nam Vang. Central Vietnamese cooking is distinct from the cuisines of both the Northern and Southern regions, in its use of many small side dishes and requiring more more complex preparation (ingredient prep, cooking, serving etc.). The royal cuisine of Hue places greater importance and food presentation, examples like B√°nh b√®o and B√°nh b·ªôt l·ªçc. It is also distinctive in its spiciness when compared to its counterparts, for example in B√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø. Food items from this region also tend to be lesser in size of individual portions. Central Vietnam dishes also feature a large amount of seafood. Certain unusual foods are more prevalent in one region than in another. For example, dog meat is much more popular in the North than in the South. Cat meat is also eaten in Northern parts of the country. Similarly, certain seafood dishes and game meat, such as basa fish or grilled rodent meat, while popular in other parts of the country, is uncommon in the North. Southern Vietnam has a renowned coffee culture while tea is the preferred beverage in the North. Clothing Traditional clothes are also often used to symbolize different regions. In women's attire, commonly the √Åo t·ª© th√¢n is associated with the North, the √°o d√†i with the central region (due to its emergence in the Vietnamese royal court in the 18th century), and the √Åo b√† ba in the South (although many of these clothes are worn across different regions). However, the √°o d√†i is now a very popular and widely worn ladies' attire nationwide. Linguistic differences Map of main Vietnamese dialects. The Vietnamese language features many accents, the three major dialects are those of the North, Center, and South with major differences in phonology and vocabulary. Due to cultural prominence, the Hanoi and Saigon accents are mostly intelligible to speakers from other regions. The Central accent, in particular from the provinces of Ngh·ªá An, H√† Tƒ©nh, Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh, Qu·∫£ng Nam, and Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i is often unintelligible to speakers outside of these regions. Differences in these accents lie in several different factors, including but not limited to the following: * Pronunciation of words, an example would be: a Hanoi is pronounced like the English /z/ while a Saigon is pronounced like the English /j/. * Northern Vietnamese has the full 6 tones, whereas Southern Vietnamese has only 5 (merging two of the tones into one) * Words ending in \\"nh\\" are pronounced differently between North and South (See Vietnamese phonology for details) * Merging of the \\"tr\\" and \\"ch\\" sounds in Northern Vietnamese * Some differences in vocabulary between different regions * Northerners speak with a higher-pitched accent and frequently pronounce words with a /z/ (even though the letter doesn't exist in the Vietnamese Latin alphabet). * Central Vietnamese (in the North-Central Coast, from Ngh·ªá An to Th·ª´a Thi√™n - Hu·∫ø) speak in a high-pitched, diverse accents. In areas of Ngh·ªá An, people live in different villages could speak in completely different accents. * Southerners, along with the South Central Coast provinces of B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh, Ph√∫ Y√™n, Kh√°nh H√≤a, Ninh Thu·∫≠n and B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n, speak in a more lower-pitched, more monotone accent, which is also found in the accents of various aboriginal languages spoken by Montagnard hill tribe ethnicities. In Central Vietnamese, the number of tones is reduced to 5 (om Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and Hu·∫ø accents) or only 4 (in H√† Tƒ©nh, Ngh·ªá An and Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh accents). One of the distinctive feature of Central Vietnamese and Qu·∫£ng Nam accent is the use of a different set of particles and pronouns, making it stand apart from Northern and Southern Vietnamese. For example, chi, m√¥, t√™, rƒÉng and r·ª©a (what, where, that, why and thus) are used instead of g√¨, ƒë√¢u, k√¨a, sao and v·∫≠y in Standard Vietnamese. While these differences may seem superficial to non-Vietnamese speakers, even the difference in phonologyThe vocabularies of the different regions also differ. between Northern and Southern Vietnamese is quite striking. Kinship terms are especially affected, as each term has a subtly different meaning in each region. In the South, the eldest child in a family is referred by the ordinal number two, while in the North \\"number two\\" refers to the second-eldest child. The vocabularies of the different regions also differ. Vocabulary differences can be confusing as sometimes the same word could have different meaning in each dialects. For example, the word m·∫≠n refers to two different fruits: it is used for Prunus salicina (a type of plum) in the North, while in the South it refers to Syzygium samarangense (the rose apple). Similarly, dƒ©a means \\"disk\\" in Southern Vietnamese and \\"fork\\" in Northern Vietnamese; ch√® is a dessert in Southern Vietnamese but means \\"tea\\" in Northern Vietnamese, ·ªëm means sick in Northern Vietnamese and thin in Southern Vietnamese. \\"b√¥ng\\" refers to flower in Southern Vietnamese but means cotton in Northern Vietnamese, the word for \\"fart\\" in Southern Vietnamese is a curse word in Northern Vietnamese. Vietnam map of K√∂ppen climate classification. While the entire country lies in the tropics, there is quite a large difference in climate between Northern and Southern Vietnam. Differences in climate Northern Vietnam has a humid subtropical climate, with a full four seasons, with much cooler temperatures than in the South (which has a tropical savanna climate), as well as winters that can get quite cold, sometimes with frost and even (rarely) snowfall. The lowest temperature reached in Hanoi was 2.7 ¬∞C in 1955.:Lowest temperature recorded in Hanoi Snow can even be found to an extent up in the mountains of the extreme Northern regions in places such as Sapa and L·∫°ng S∆°n. Southern Vietnam, with its much hotter temperatures, has only two main seasons: a dry season and a rainy season. Miscellaneous cultural differences * While Southern Vietnamese often ring in the Lunar New Year (T·∫øt) with yellow mai (Ochna integerrima) blossoms, Northern Vietnamese often prefer hoa ƒë√†o (peach) blossoms.

It is located near Sringeri and is situated on the banks of river Tunga. It is famous for a Hindu Math called Shri Vidya Peetam which is present at this place. The Kumbhabhishekam event held at this place attracts a number of devotees.  History  The history of the Shri Vidya Peetam can be traced to a sadhu named Thotakacharya, who was a disciple of Adi Shankara and the first pontiff of the Uttaramnaya Jyotish Peetam, a Hindu institution, located in Badrinath. A sadhu named Sri Satya Theertha who was of the same lineage as Thotakacharya, came to Shakatapuram about six centuries ago and established the Shri Vidya Peetam. An idol of the Hindu God, Lakshmi Narayana was brought by Sri Satya Teertha from Badarinath and installed at Shakatapuram. This is the presiding deity of this place. The Hindu Gods, Krishna, Raja Rajeshwari and Dattatreya are also worshipped here. The Math preaches the Advaita form of Hindu philosophy.  Current scenario  The current pontiff of the Math is Sri Sri Sri Krishnananda Theertha Mahaswamigal who is the 33rd pontif to head this institution. He is a scholar in Kannada, Sanskrit and Vedanta and he became the head of this institution at the age of 13. He started touring India in 1994, to spread his message of goodwill and spirituality amongst the people. In 1962, Sri Sri Ramachandrananda Theertha, the then pontiff of the Math established a branch at East Tambaram in Chennai. Kumbhabhisheka Kumbhabhishekham was celebrated in the Math in 2001 and 2007. In 2001, the event were held to celebrate the installation of a temple to worship the Hindu Lord, Ganesha and the completion of 20 years of the pontificate of Sri Krishnananda Theertha Mahaswamigal. In 2007, the event attracted thousands of devotees from other states of India as well. This event was attended by the BJP leader, Murali Manohar Joshi. Horekanike (offerings of food articles) were made during this event.

Years later, another investigation of Tennessee public corruption was code-named Operation Tennessee Waltz, after another state song. Investigation Operation Rocky Top was launched in 1986 as an FBI and Tennessee Bureau of Investigation undercover investigation into illegal activities in charity bingo, including the illegal sale of bingo licenses. A first-year member of the Tennessee House of Representatives, Randy McNally of Oak Ridge, became a secret participant in the investigation in 1986 after he reported to authorities that a bingo lobbyist had offered him bribes and had boasted about bribing other lawmakers. For the duration of the investigation McNally wore a wire and cultivated the trust of bingo lobbyists and other insiders so they would talk freely in front of him and offer him bribes. Ned McWherter, who was Speaker of the Tennessee House when the investigation began and who was elected Governor of Tennessee in 1986, also was praised by federal officials for cooperating with the investigation. Results Operation Rocky Top became public in January 1989 when W.D. \\"Donnie\\" Walker, a one-time bingo regulator in the state government who later became a lobbyist, pleaded guilty to offering McNally a $10,000 bribe in exchange for his vote on a measure to legalize horse racing. In exchange for a plea bargain, Walker gave investigators details on how he had helped bingo operators become chartered as bogus charities so they could obtain state licenses to run bingo games, and how bingo operators then channeled money back to state legislators who were part of the scheme. At the height of activity there were nearly 300 bingo operations in the state with estimated annual revenue of $31 million. The investigation resulted in more than 50 convictionsTom Humphrey, Humphrey: Waltz -- Don't leave with those who bribed you, Knoxville News Sentinel (opinion column), July 22, 2007 and the incarceration of several politicians, most notably Tennessee House of Representatives' majority leader, Democrat Tommy Burnett.

It had previously operated as the Central Hockey League (1925‚Äì1926), and before that as part of the United States Amateur Hockey Association. The AHA was the first professional hockey league to field teams in the Southern United States. The founding president was Alvin Warren, who also owned the St. Paul Saints. Other founding owners included William Grant, league secretary and owner of the Duluth Hornets (and Warren's successor as president in 1930), Paul Loudon of the Minneapolis Millers, and William Holmes, owner of the league's only Canadian franchise, the Winnipeg Maroons, and also owner of the Winnipeg Auditorium. History Eddie Livingstone, banished by National Hockey League team owners in 1917, owned the Chicago Cardinals. Eager to sign a new interleague agreement with the NHL in 1927, the AHA revoked Livingstone's franchise after one season when NHL president Frank Calder threatened that no deal would be signed with the league as long as it was associated with Livingstone. The Oklahoma-based Tulsa Oilers and Missouri-based St. Louis Flyers took the ice in 1928, predating the NHL's short-lived St. Louis Eagles franchise by six years. The Kansas City Greyhounds were added to the league in 1933. The Oilers and Flyers were also joined in the early 1940s by two Texas-based teams, the Dallas Texans and Fort Worth Rangers. By 1930, some AHA owners, led by Walter Whiteside of the Tulsa Oilers, were questioning the league's relationship with the NHL. They approved the creation of a new Chicago franchise, the Chicago Shamrocks, owned by James E. Norris, bringing the league into an NHL market. Renaming the league the American Hockey League, they also established a franchise in Buffalo, New York, an IHL city, which would have been prohibited under the previous agreement with the NHL.\\"Regard American as an outlaw league,\\" Toronto Star, October 10, 1930, p. 14. In October 1930, Calder declared the AHL to be an outlaw league and threatened never to allow any AHL players into the NHL. The NHL carried out its threat and denied the applications of former AHL players to join NHL teams for the 1931‚Äì32 season. In the fall of 1931, the AHL applied to the Stanley Cup trustees to challenge for the trophy, but was unsuccessful in its attempts to force the NHL into a series. The AHL struggled through two seasons in opposition to the NHL. The Buffalo Majors folded halfway through the 1931‚Äì32 season, leaving 12 players who unsuccessfully tried to sue team owners to recover $12,000 in unpaid salaries.\\"Hockey players fail to recover salaries,\\" Toronto Star, July 13, 1932, p. 12. By the summer of 1932, the AHL was willing to sign another affiliation agreement with the NHL and officially return to minor league status.\\"Hockey league feud brought to an end,\\" Toronto Star, September 16, 1932, p. 13. The NHL insisted that the AHL leave Chicago, and the Shamrocks were shut down, despite having won the league championship. Norris was told that he would be welcomed into the NHL and acquired the Detroit franchise in 1933. The AHL went back to being known as the American Hockey Association. The AHA, led by acting president Lyle Wright of the Omaha Knights, voted to shut the league down in the fall of 1942. It returned after World War II as the United States Hockey League, starting with the 1945‚Äì46 season.

The novel tells the story of two women who sailed from London to the shore of the Virginia wilderness in 1587. Elenor White Dare is daughter of the expedition's leader and mother of Virginia Dare, the first English child born on the American continent. Freshly married and newly pregnant when she boards the ship, Elenor longs to explore and paint pictures of the New World, as her father has done, but her dreams are frustrated by her status as John White's daughter - not his son. Margaret Lawrence, her bold young servant, blazes her own path to independence as a member of the struggling colony that settles on Roanoke Island. The adventures of Elenor and Margaret begin in Elizabethan London, cross the Atlantic, pass through the Caribbean, and climax in the Outer Banks region of North America. Historically, John White, the leader of the venture, sailed home to London for supplies and then returned three years later to find no trace of the hundred colonists he'd left in Virginia except the word \\"Croatoan\\" carved in a post.

Background=Mandal Commission Mandal Commission was set up in 1979 January by Morarji Desai government to identify the socially or educationally backward classes to consider the question of seat reservations and quotas for people to redress caste discrimination, and used eleven social, economic, and educational indicators to determine backwardness. It was chaired by B. P. Mandal. The commission submitted the report to the president on December 30, 1980. It recommended 27% reservation quota for OBC resulting in total 49.5% quota in government jobs and public universities. V.P. Singh, the Prime Minister at the time, tried to implement its recommendations in August 1990 which led to protests. Protests These protests were against giving government jobs to certain castes on basis of birth rather than merit of the candidate. These protests closed roads, highways, transportation services, government services, schools, and businesses of India. Anti-reservationists protested. Student protests were planned publicly, and in advance. Protest events were photographed for many published articles of newspapers locally and nationally.The Tribune newspaper, 1 September 1990, Chandigarh, India. Protests began during the year when the eleven-year-old Mandal Commission was opened to bring into effect new government employment opportunities, reservation for backwards classes. Between the failure to effectively control the political cost of the protests escalating enough to close parts of the nation, and an eleven-year-old human rights improvement project, were causes that ultimately led to accepting the resignation of the Janata Dal party's Prime Minister of India, V. P. Singh. Most likely, the protests were comparable to a globally largest, unified national demonstrations of a labour union strike combined with a version of a race riot. Culturally unique features of the protests and riots were bandhs (a version of a strike), hartals (a version of a municipal shut-down), dharnas (a version of swarming). Incidents of destruction of public property, looting, and intimidation for bandhs, hartals and dharnas were published and listed geographically as travel information in newspaper articles. Articles also highlighted politicians and victims of rioting during the protests. Although not advisable, late summer travel by airline and vehicle during the protests was possible without delays, between capitals New Delhi and Chandigarh, and Shimla for example. Police prevented extending the range and duration of the strikes, and some strike activity from even occurring. A national state of emergency was largely not declared to mobilize army units against any one demonstration.. The strike helped to give large popularity to Mandal Commission report and fueled the political grouping of the OBC castes, which later helped a lot for the strengthening of regional political parties and stronger parties other than Congress and BJP. Self immolations=Rajiv Goswami Rajiv Goswami was the first student to attempt self-immolation while a student at Deshbandhu College, Delhi University in October, 1990 to protest against Prime Minister V.P. Singh's implementation of the Mandal Commission laws for Affirmative Action (reservation) recommendations. His action sparked a series of self-immolations by college students and led to a formidable movement against job reservations for backward castes, as recommended by the Mandal Commission. He was later elected as the President of Delhi University's Student Union, he passed away after about a decade of suffering cause of the 70% burns he had suffered.

It was printed in Rome by Ludovico Grignani and dedicated to Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria. It was a compendium of ancient and contemporary thinking about music, its production and its effects. It explored, in particular, the relationship between the mathematical properties of music (e.g. harmony and dissonance) with health and rhetoric. The work complements two of Kircher's other books: Magnes sive de Arte Magnetica had set out the secret underlying coherence of the universe and Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae had explored the ways of knowledge and enlightenment. What Musurgia Universalis contained, through its exploration of dissonance within harmony, was an explanation of the presence of evil in the world. Composition and publication Kircher-musurgia-bird-song Kircher compiled all the musical knowledge available in his day, making this the first encyclopedia of music. Since its publication it has been a valuable source of information to musicologists about baroque concepts of style and composition. It provides the earliest account of the doctrine of the affections in music. As well as including a three-part fantasy of his own and a composition by Emperor Ferdinand III, Kircher reproduced many musical pieces to illustrate the styles he described, thereby preserving pieces by Frescobaldi, Froberger, and others. Kircher had a number of collaborators who assisted his research with their expertise, and by providing him with examples of different types of music. These included Antonio Maria Abbatini, Giovanni Girolamo Kapsperger and Giacomo Carissimi. Musurgia Universalis was one of Kircher's largest books. The work was published in two volumes with a total of 1,112 pages and many illustrations. It was one of the most influential books on music theory in the seventeenth century, and of the 1,500 copies known to have been published, 266 are still recorded in various collections. Three hundred copies of the first edition were distributed to Jesuit missionaries who gathered in Rome in 1650 for the election of the new Superior General and carried back to many different lands. In 1656 a Jesuit mission to China took two dozen copies with it when it departed. A second edition was published in Amsterdam in 1662. Concepts Organ of the world's creation from Book ten of \\"Musurgia universalis\\", Wellcome L0025813 The concepts presented in Musurgia Universalis overlap with Kircher's other works - they include musical cryptography (Polygraphia Nova) and tarantism (Magnes sive de Arte Magnetica). There was a detailed discussion of the phenomenon of the echo and its similarity to the reflection of light (Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae). His account of speaking tubes and amplification was developed in his later work Historia Eustachio Mariana, concerning his installation of trumpets that broadcast a call to prayer at the shrine of Mentorella. Book eight explained a method for composition and writing harmony that Kircher maintained any person could use, whether they knew anything about music or not. Hew had invented this system while teaching mathematics at W√ºrzburg University many years previously. This method had great appeal for Jesuits working as missionaries, who sought to use the power of music to draw converts to the Catholic faith by composing hymns in the languages of the people where they were working. Accompanying this method was a description of the arca musurgia, a kind of calculating machine that allowed users to apply Kircher's rules on composition and actually create music. A number of these machines were built and distributed to distinguished patrons together with the book. After providing the reader with many explanations of physical phenomena and their explanation, as in many of his other works Kircher used the final book to expound the spiritual dimension of everything he has revealed. In Musurgia Universalis he likens the creation of the world to the building of a great organ with six registers corresponding to the six days of creation on which God plays, creating harmony. The illustration shows the elaborately-decorated organ with small circular panels illustrating each of the days of creation. Structure Kircher-ark *Book one: on physiology, dealing with the structure of the ear, anatomy of the vocal organs, and the sounds made by animals, birds and insects, including the death-song of the swan *Book two: on philology, the origin of sound, the music of the Hebrews, and the ancient Greeks *Book three: on arithmetic, with the theory of harmonics, proportion, the ratios of intervals, the Greek scales, the Scale of Guido d'Arezzo, the system of Boethius, and the ancient Greek modes *Book four: on geometry, discussion of the monochord, and its divisions *Book five: on organology, based book xii of the Harmonicorum by Marin Mersenne, containing a dissertation on instrumental music *Book six: on composition, musical notation, counterpoint, and other branches of composition, containing a canon that can be sung by twelve million two hundred thousand voices *Book seven: on discernment, covering the difference between ancient and modern music *Books eight: on wonders, including a mathematical method (‚Äòmusarithmica‚Äô) that allows the most inexperienced to compose with perfection *Book nine: on the magic of consonance and dissonance and their effects on the mind and body including tarantism *Book ten: on analogy, discusses the harmony of the spheres, and of the four elements, the principles of harmony exemplified in the proportions of the human body and the affections of the mind, together with practical description of the aeolian harp, which Kircher claimed to have invented. Illustrations Frontispiece,volume one of \\"Musurgia Universalis\\" by Athanasius Kircher, 1650 Frontispiece, volume two, \\"Musurgia Universalis\\" by Athanasius Kircher, 1650 An engraved portrait of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm faces the frontispiece of volume one, was designed by Johann Paul Schor and engraved by Paulus Pontius, a student of Rubens. It is dated 'Antwerp 1649'. Each of the work's two volumes had its own frontispiece. For volume one this followed the design common to many of Kircher's works, depicting a threefold universe with the divine at the top, the celestial in the middle and the earthly below. At the top the eye of God overlooks all from within a triangle which bathes choirs of angels in divine light. Two angels hold aloft a banner proclaiming the sanctus as a 'Canon angelicus 36 vocum... in 9 choros distributus' ('a 36-voice canon of angels, divided into nine choirs'). Beneath this sits Apollo on the celestial sphere, holding the lyre that symbolises harmony and pushing away the panpipes associated with his rival Marysas. Together with the signs of the zodiac, the sphere carries a quotation from the Book of Job (38:37): 'Quis concentum coeli dormire faciet?' ('Who shall make the concert of heaven to sleep?').At the bottom left of the image Pythagoras sits, with one arm resting on this theorem and the other pointing towards a group of smiths, the sound of whose hammers striking metal first gave him the notion of the mathematical basis of harmony. In the centre are a ring of dancers on land, and to their right, a triton dancing in the water with mermaids. On the right there is an illustration of an echo, a topic discussed in the work, with a shepherd reciting a line from Virgil and a listener mishearing only the last part of the final word. The echo rebounds from the side of Mount Helicon, where Pegasus strikes the rock with his hoof, bringing forth the stream of Hippocrene that flows down to the figure of Muse surrounded by musical instruments. The frontispiece for volume two was designed by Pierre Miotte. It depicts Orpheus with his lyre and the three- headed guardian of the underworld, Cerberus. The motto around his pedestal reads 'Apollo's right hand holds the lyre of the world, his left fits high to low; thus good things are mingled with ill.'

Life and works He was born in the Lower Street of the Carmen neighborhood of Valencia. His earliest sculptures featured bullfighting themes, modeled in wax and cast in bronze. At the age of thirteen he showed a wax modello of a picador at the Exposici√≥n Nacional de Bellas Artes, 1876. Pursuing the thought of becoming a painter, he went to Paris his expenses paid by his master, Francisco Domingo Marqu√©s. A trip to Rome in 1879, revealing at first hand the sculptures of Michelangelo convinced him to be a sculptor. In 1887 he established himself permanently in Madrid, where in that year's Exposici√≥n Nacional his portrait sculpture of the painter Ribera won him a first-prize. Benlliure's style is characterized by detailed naturalism allied to an impressionistic spontaneity. His portrait busts and public monuments are numerous, and include: * the tomb of Pr√°xedes Mateo Sagasta in the Pantheon of Illustrious Men, Madrid * monument to Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, Lima, Peru * the monument to √Ålvaro de Baz√°n, Plaza de la Villa, Madrid. * the monument to Isabella the Catholic, Granada * the monument to General Cassola, Parque del Oeste, Madrid * the monument to Maria Christina of Bourbon, Madrid * the bronze equestrian statue of the monument to Alfonso XII, in Madrid's El Retiro, the centerpiece of a memorial designed by architect Jos√© Grases Riera. * the monument to Agustina de Arag√≥n, in Zaragoza. * the monument to Castelar, in Madrid. * the monument to Arsenio Mart√≠nez Campos, in El Retiro. * the monument to Miguel Primo de Rivera, in Jerez de la Frontera. * the monument to Antonio Maura, in Palma de Mallorca. * the monument to Cuba, in El Retiro, with help from Miquel Blay, Francisco Asorey and Juan Crist√≥bal (completed by 1930, unveiled in 1952).

Italian dishes commonly prepared in this way include pizza, breads and pasta dishes, notably lasagna. Pasta is sometimes boiled before it is baked in al forno dishes. This double cooking means that it is served soft, not with the firm al dente consistency that some Italians prefer in pasta dishes. History and culture Lasagna is baked both to cook the filling and melt the cheese topping. Southern Italy has a tradition of wood-burning ovens and open-flame grills. A wood-fired oven and al forno dishes are a feature of many Italian restaurants. Brick and clay ovens are a key feature of cuisines of the Mediterranean and Middle East, with wood being the main fuel for many parts of Europe for many centuries. A typical oven found in Italian restaurants is brick lined with an arched oven door, and a wooden board with a very long handle is used to place the food to be cooked in the centre of the oven.

He has been described as an English journalist, a Russian Finn, an American of Finnish origin, a Swedish journalist and adventurer, and an intrepid American journalist. He is the author of I Sailed with Chinese Pirates, an account of the time he spent among pirates of the South China seas. Biography Lilius was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on 2 April1890. His father was a senior translator for the Senate of Finland and served as a staff captain in the Izmaylovsky Regiment. His mother was Natalia Starck who was born in the Caucasus and was the daughter of major general Julius Starck. Before World War I, Lilius was an enterprising businessman whose colorful exploits attracted much publicity. In 1916, Lilius was the highest taxed private individual in Finland as a private banker who owned the . As a young man, he explored much of the Americas, China, North Africa, and South Africa, before settling down for a while in the Philippines. Lilius' writing was based on his wide-ranging travels in places such as China, Morocco, and Mexico. The first mention of Lilius as a writer is as the author of the script for the 1919 Finnish film (In Search of Venus or The Marvelous Adventures of a Young Man). During the 1920s and 1930s, Lilius worked as a foreign correspondent in Asia and North Africa. During the 1920s, he worked with linguist Rudolf Schuller as a photographer in Mexico. In the 1930s, Lilius lived in the United States, residing in the Armour‚ÄìStiner Octagon House in Irvington, New York. He ran into conflict with the law several times in the 1930s. According to an article in the Singaporean The Straits Times, Lilius was convicted of fraud and \\"sentenced to two months hard labour\\" in 1929.The Straits Times. 23 September 1929, p. 13. Four years later while in the Philippines, he was again pronounced guilty of fraud for issuing four checks with insufficient funds and was sentenced to one year and one day in prison plus required to pay what he owed. Lilius appealed to a higher court for a reversal of the lower court's decision; his appeal was successful and the charges were reversed.[G.R. No. L-38774 December 23, 1933 The People of the Philippine Islands, Plaintiff-Appellee, vs. Aleko Lilius Defendant- Appellant from ChanRobles Virtual Law Library http://www.chanrobles.com] Lilius sued a Philippine railroad company after the car in which he and has family were traveling was hit by a locomotive in 1931. Although he won the suit in a lower court, the railroad company appealed to the Supreme Court. Lilius again succeeded and was awarded P30,865. In the 1950s he lived in Morocco. In 1958 he moved to Helsinki, Finland, and later devoted himself to painting. Lilius died on 24June 1977 in Helsinki, Finland. Works= I Sailed with Chinese Pirates  Lilius is primarily remembered as the author of I Sailed with Chinese Pirates, an account of the time he spent among the pirates of the South China seas. The original review in The New York Times (27July 1931) reads in part: Lai Choi San is widely believed to be the source of inspiration for the character of the Dragon Lady, the oriental femme fatale in Milton Caniff\\"s comic strip Terry and the Pirates. Lilius referred to Lai Choi San as Queen of the Pirates rather than Dragon Lady, but Caniff did use the Chinese name for his character. According to one source, this was the cause of a later legal dispute between Lilius and the syndicate that produced the comic strip. A review of the 1991 Oxford University Press reprint says the book is \\"a good read in the sensational nineteen-twenties style of journalism ... briskly moving but somewhat superficial\\".

It was founded in 1869 and existed until at least the mid-1880s. View of the Bidwell Mill about 1880 Location Ivanpah was located at 35¬∞ 32' 42.15\\" -115¬∞ 32' 7.19\\" (WGS84), on the northeast side of Clark Mountain. History While searching for copper, the Piute Company of California and Nevada in 1869 found rich deposits of silver ore on the lower slopes of what was soon named Clark Mountain, west of the Nevada line. The company laid out a townsite at Willow Spring, near a wash on the southeast slope, about nine miles east of the discoveries. The settlement was named Ivanpah, which, roughly translated from a Native American language (probably one of the Numic languages), means ‚Äúclear water‚Äù. By the summer of 1871, Ivanpah had become a small but well-established trading center for a huge district spilling over into Nevada. A traveler came across fifteen well-built adobe buildings, including a hotel, two stores, the office and headquarters of the Piute Company, and several small houses. A deep gorge led to the mines, which were scattered about Mineral (Alaska) Hill. The chief properties were the Hite & Chatfield claim, which was soon renamed the Lizzie Bullock, and the Monitor and Beatrice, owned by the McFarlane brothers: Tom, Andrew, John, and William. Six miles southwest of Ivanpah was the Copper World Mine. Despite litigation and intermittent depressions, the McFarlanes put up a 5-stamp mill near town in 1875; JA Bidwell, the new owner of the Lizzie Bullock, built a 10-stamp mill in 1876; and a post office was established in early 1878. By the spring of 1879, the 100 men on Alaska Hill were carrying on a brisk trade at Ivanpah‚Äôs two saloons, two stores, two blacksmith shops, two shoemakers‚Äô shops, two hotels, two hay yards, a butcher shop, and several ‚Äúneat and comfortable‚Äù houses. A weekly newspaper, named the Green-Eyed Monster, was founded in early 1880, but it died after a few issues. The ore, however, was losing its value, and the new camps of Calico and Providence were drawing away miners. The post office was moved to the new smelter camp of Valley Wells in early 1899, and its name was changed to Rosalie. About a dozen stone and adobe ruins remain at the town-site and millsites.

In the Malaysia Bill of the Malaysia Agreement some of the twenty points were incorporated, to varying degrees, into what became the Constitution of Malaysia; others were merely accepted orally, thus not gaining legal status. The 20-point agreement often serves as a focal point amongst those who argue that Sabah's rights within the Federation have been eroded over time.  Background  Under an agreement signed between Great Britain and the Federation of Malaya the issue of self-determination with respect to the peoples of North Borneo and Sarawak formed a challenge to the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. A Joint Statement issued by the British and Malayan Federal Governments on 23 November 1961 announced that before coming to any final decision it was necessary to ascertain the views of the peoples of North Borneo and Sarawak. It was decided to set up a commission to carry out that task and to make recommendations. The British Government, working with the Federation of Malaya Government, appointed a Commission of Enquiry for North Borneo and Sarawak in January 1962 to determine if the people supported the proposal to create a Federation of Malaysia. The five-man team, which comprised two Malayans and three British representatives, was headed by Lord Cobbold.Cobbold was Governor of the Bank of England from 1949 to 1961. The other members were Wong Pow Nee, Chief Minister of Penang, Mohammed Ghazali Shafie, Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Anthony Abell, former Governor or Sarawak, and David Watherston, former Chief Secretary of the Federation of Malaya. An inter-governmental committee (The Lansdowne Committee) was appointed to work out the final details of the Malaysia Agreement. Lord Lansdowne served for Britain and Tun Abdul Razak, Deputy Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya served for Malaya. The 20 points were written with a view to safeguarding the interests, rights, and autonomy of the people of North Borneo upon the formation of the federation of Malaysia. A similar proposal, with certain differences in content, was made by Sarawak, and is commonly referred to as the 18-point agreement. Attention is often drawn to these memoranda by those who believe that their principles were not subsequently adhered to after federation. There have been numerous calls for the 20-point memorandum to be reviewed so as to take into account social, economic, and political changes over time. Brief timeline of related events The Report of the Inter-Governmental Committee. On 1 August 1962 *17 January 1962: The Commission of Enquiry (Cobbold Commission) was announced to observe the views of the people of Singapore, Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo. *21 March 1962: At a meeting of the Greater Malaysia Committee there was agreement that it would be preferable to wait for the Cobbold Commission, which had been tasked with assessment of support for the proposal in North Borneo and Sarawak, to complete its report, in order to consider its findings before a decision was made on the federation of Malaysia. *21 June 1962: The Cobbold Report was completed and submitted to the prime ministers of Britain and Malaya (confidentially). The report concluded that one third fully supported the idea, one third were in favour provided that safeguards were included, and the remaining one third were divided between those who would prefer North Borneo and Sarawak to gain independence prior to the merger and those who rejected the merger outright. The commission's view was - firm support for a federated Malaysia (with transfer of sovereignty within twelve months), incorporating a transitional arrangement in which the British would remain for the first few years. *31 July 1962: The British and Malayan governments decided in principle that the proposed Federation of Malaysia should be brought into being by 31 August 1963. An Inter-Governmental Committee (IGC) was to be formed to work on future constitutional arrangements. *August 1962: The Report was published to all parties. Reportedly, this came as a surprise to North Borneo. *13 ‚Äì 14 August 1962: Donald Stephens convened a meeting of political leaders who drew up a 14-point (later 20-point) memorandum of minimum demands. This gained support from Sarawak. *12 & 26 September 1962 (respectively): North Borneo and Sarawak legislative council agreed to the formation of Malaysia on condition that state rights were safeguarded.  The 20 points = Point 1: Religion  While there was no objection to Islam being the national religion of Malaysia, there should be no State religion in North Borneo, and the provisions relating to Islam in the present Constitution of Malaya should not apply to North Borneo.  Point 2: Language  *a. Malay should be the national language of the Federation *b. English should continue to be used for a period of 10 years after Malaysia Day *c. English should be an official language of North Borneo for all purposes, State or Federal, without limitation of time.  Point 3: Constitution  Whilst accepting that the present Constitution of the Federation of Malaya should form the basis of the Constitution of Malaysia, the Constitution of Malaysia should be a completely new document drafted and agreed in the light of a free association of states and should not be a series of amendments to a Constitution drafted and agreed by different states in totally different circumstances. A new Constitution for North Borneo was of course essential.  Point 4: Head of Federation  The Head of State in North Borneo should not be eligible for election as Head of the Federation.  Point 5: Name of Federation  \\"Malaysia\\" but not \\"Melayu Raya\\".  Point 6: Immigration  Control over immigration into any part of Malaysia from outside should rest with the Central Government but entry into North Borneo should also require the approval of the State Government. The Federal Government should not be able to veto the entry of persons into North Borneo for State Government purposes except on strictly security grounds. North Borneo should have unfettered control over the movements of persons other than those in Federal Government employ from other parts of Malaysia into North Borneo.  Point 7: Right of Secession  There should be no right to secede from the Federation  Point 8: Borneanisation  Borneanisation of the public service should proceed as quickly as possible.  Point 9: British Officers  Every effort should be made to encourage British Officers to remain in the public service until their places can be taken by suitably qualified people from North Borneo.  Point 10: Citizenship  The recommendation in paragraph 148(k) of the Report of the Cobbold Commission should govern the citizenship rights in the Federation of North Borneo subject to the following amendments: *a) sub-paragraph (i) should not contain the proviso as to five years residence *b) in order to tie up with our law, sub- paragraph (ii)(a) should read \\"7 out of 10 years\\" instead of \\"8 out of 10 years\\" *c) sub-paragraph (iii) should not contain any restriction tied to the citizenship of parents ‚Äì a person born in North Borneo after Malaysia must be federal citizen.  Point 11: Tariffs and Finance  North Borneo should retain control of its own finance, development and tariff, and should have the right to work up its own taxation and to raise loans on its own credit.  Point 12: Special position of indigenous races  In principle the indigenous races of North Borneo should enjoy special rights analogous to those enjoyed by Malays in Malaya, but the present Malaya formula in this regard is not necessarily applicable in North Borneo.  Point 13: State Government  *a) the Prime Minister should be elected by unofficial members of Legislative Council *b) There should be a proper Ministerial system in North Borneo.  Point 14: Transitional period  This should be seven years and during such period legislative power must be left with the State of North Borneo by the Constitution and not be merely delegated to the State Government by the Federal Government.  Point 15: Education  The existing educational system of North Borneo should be maintained and for this reason it should be under state control.  Point 16: Constitutional safeguards  No amendment modification or withdrawal of any special safeguard granted to North Borneo should be made by the Central Government without the positive concurrence of the Government of the State of North Borneo The power of amending the Constitution of the State of North Borneo should belong exclusively to the people in the state. (Note: The United Party, The Democratic Party and the Pasok Momogun Party considered that a three-fourths majority would be required in order to effect any amendment to the Federal and State Constitutions whereas the UNKO and USNO considered a two-thirds majority would be sufficient.)  Point 17: Representation in Federal Parliament  This should take account not only of the population of North Borneo but also of its size and potentialities and in any case should not be less than that of Singapore.  Point 18: Name of Head of State  Yang di-Pertua Negara.  Point 19: Name of State  Sabah.  Point 20: Land, Forests, Local Government, etc.  The provisions in the Constitution of the Federation in respect of the powers of the National Land Council should not apply in North Borneo. Likewise, the National Council for Local Government should not apply in North Borneo. Controversies=Point 7: Right of Secession Article 2 of the Constitution of Malaysia states that the Parliament of Malaysia has the right to change the state boundaries or to admit any new states into the federation. However, there is no provision about the secession of states from the federation. However, former International Islamic University Malaysia (PIHE) academic, Dr Abdul Aziz Bari, said that Article 2 of the Constitution also implies that the Malaysian Parliament has the final say on the secession of a state from the federation, as it did to Singapore in 1965. Besides, any suggestions about secession of Sabah and Sarawak from Malaysia would be punishable under Sedition Act. Dr Jeniri Amir from Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) stated that Sarawak and Sabah has no right to secede from the federation according to Point 7. However, a separatist group led by Doris Jones said that the meaning of the word \\"should\\" as in \\"There should be no right to secede from the Federation\\" is only a recommendation as opposed to \\"shall\\" which implies a command. Point 18: Name of Head of State In the Malaysia Agreement, the meaning of the term \\"Governor\\" included the title of the Head of State of Sabah, which was \\"Yang di-Pertua Negara\\". This term was incorporated into the Constitution of Malaysia from 1963 to 1976. However, the Sarawak head of state was named \\"Yang di-Pertua Negeri\\" from 1963. On 27 August 1976, under Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia, the term \\"Governor\\" was abolished and replaced with \\"Yang di-Pertua Negeri\\".Blaustein, A.P., Flanz, G.H.(1971). In Constitutions of the Countries of the World. Oceana Publications. p.298. Google Book Search. Retrieved 24 September 2014. This effectively ended the title of \\"Yang di-Pertua Negara\\" of Sabah. The Malay translation of the term \\"State\\" of Sabah and Sarawak has been \\"Negeri\\" (Federated states) instead of \\"Negara\\" (Nation) since 1963. Nevertherless, some groups argue that Sabah and Sarawak should be called \\"Negara\\" (Nation), and the head of state called \\"Yang di-Pertua Negara\\", on the basis that Sarawak achieved independence on 22 July 1963 and Sabah achieved independence on 31 August 1963 before forming Malaysia together with Federation of Malaya on 16 September 1963. They believe that the head of state of Sabah being known as \\"Yang di-Pertua Negara\\" between 1963 and 1976 supports this view.

Block booking was the prevailing practice among Hollywood's major studios from the turn of the 1930s until it was outlawed by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. (1948). Under block booking, \\"independent ('unaffiliated') theater owners were forced to take large numbers of [a] studio's pictures sight unseen. Those studios could then parcel out second- rate product along with A-class features and star vehicles, which made both production and distribution operations more economical.\\" The element of the system involving the purchase of unseen pictures is known as blind bidding. Origins in the silent era Paramount Pictures, under Adolph Zukor's leadership, was largely responsible for introducing the practice of block booking to Hollywood: > At a time when star prominence was the single most important factor > determining a film's box-office success, Zukor had cornered the market. In a > 1918 popularity poll...the six top stars on the list‚ÄîMary Pickford, > Marguerite Clark, Douglas Fairbanks, Harold Lockwood, William S. Hart, and > Wallace Reid‚Äîwere all under contract to Zukor. > > Using this leverage, Paramount was able to insist that prospective > exhibitors interested in, say, the Pickford films, acquire them in large > blocks along with a quantity of less attractive titles. These block-booking > arrangements typically included groups of from 13 to 52 or even 104 titles. > Paramount salesmen offered a variety of different product lines, from the > top-quality Artcraft releases of Pickford, Fairbanks, and Hart to the more > modest Realart productions, in which stars such as Bebe Daniels were being > developed. Because these films had not yet been produced, exhibitors were > required to \\"buy blind\\" from a sketchy prospectus or campaign book. All of the other major studios, with the exception of United Artists, ultimately copied these policies to varying degrees. For much of the 1920s, Paramount and growing Warner Bros., in particular, \\"relied heavily on block booking and blind bidding.\\" Already, in 1921 the Federal Trade Commission had launched an investigation of the studios' booking practices that would last for eleven years. A 1927 cease-and-desist order was disregarded by the majors. Smaller distributors such as Associated Exhibitors who attempted to retain open booking were eventually driven to accept the practice.Ward p.86 The system's growth and demise With Hollywood's conversion to sound film in the late 1920s, block booking increasingly became standard practice: in order to get access to a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season. Paramount Pictures President Adolph Zukor obtained the Paramount-Publix chains of theaters that totaled in 1,200 screens, and insisted that the exhibitors and independent theaters sign a contract with their company if they wanted the exclusive, top-of-the-line Paramount productions. With a whole season's worth of films offered up on an all-or-nothing basis, theaters weren't just bidding on movies they hadn't seen, but on many movies not yet even made. This was also called \\"blind- bidding\\" because, other than knowing the genre, the actors and actresses, and a brief overview of the plot, the exhibitors knew nothing about the films they were acquiring. In one case, Zukor had pressured theater operators to buy a block of one hundred and four films each year and forced them to show two films per week, for fifty-two consecutive weeks. With the B movies‚Äîless expensively produced films intended to run as the lower half of double features‚Äîrented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set that essentially guaranteed the profitability of every B movie. Block booking and blind bidding meant that the majors didn't have to worry over much about the quality of these B pictures: > Knowing that even the poorest picture would find an outlet, the studios > could operate at full capacity. In the process, the majors shifted the risks > of production financing to the independent exhibitor. The long-term effects > of the policy also stifled competition by foreclosing the market to > independent producers and distributors. In short, block booking allowed the > majors to wrest the greatest amount of profits from the marketplace. Along with the blocks of features, exhibitors were required to take the major's shorts as well‚Äîa practice known as full-line forcing. The smaller Hollywood studios‚Äîknown collectively as Poverty Row‚Äîdidn't have the big pictures with A-list stars that would have allowed them to compel theater owners to directly block book. Instead, they mostly sold exclusive regional distribution rights to so-called states' rights firms. These distributors in turn marketed blocks of movies to exhibitors, typically six or more pictures featuring the same star (given that the films' source was Poverty Row, a relatively minor star). In July 1938, the Justice Department's antitrust division filed a suit, United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. et al., charging the eight major Hollywood studios with violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 controlled the interstate commerce with different trust-busting provisions and were brought to bear against studio system monopolistic activities. Block booking and blind bidding were at the heart of the practices charged as illegally monopolistic. The Department of Justice filed suit against the distribution arms of Hollywood studios in the Famous Players-Lasky antitrust case of 1928. The Department of Justice charged the ten entities that controlled ninety eight percent of the domestic theatrical distribution. Appeals were filed and the studios were able to prevent charges from being followed through until 1929, due to the collapse of the stock market and the Great Depression happening at the same time, making this issue moot. The major studios controlled the programming of their theaters and also had negotiated wide-ranging distribution deals that constricted the financial state of independent theaters. On October 29, 1940, the Big Five studios (Loews/MGM, Paramount, 20th Century-Fox, Warner Bros.-First National, and RKO‚Äîthe majors that owned large theater chains) signed a consent decree in an attempt to settle the case. It provided, among other things, that \\"block booking would continue, but in blocks no larger than five films; trade shows would be held regularly to provide exhibitors with advance screenings; [and] forcing of shorts and newsreels was banned.\\" Because the decree was forged after the September 1 beginning of the 1940‚Äì41 exhibition season, the new blocks-of-five arrangement did not go into effect until the 1941‚Äì42 season. When the consent decree lapsed in 1942, most of the majors continued with blocks of five, though MGM went with blocks of twelve for two years. In contrast, Warner Bros. abandoned blocks altogether in 1943. The practice was entirely outlawed by the Supreme Court's 1948 decision, United States v. Paramount, against the studios in the Paramount antitrust case. In concurrence with decisions held by the lower courts, the Supreme Court ruled that all of the major movie studios had prevented domestic and foreign competition through their control over theaters. In its 1948 decision, the Supreme Court ordered the elimination of block booking and demanded a separation of theater holdings from production and distribution. Without control over block booking, studios feared that they could no longer force theaters to buy up to 400 movies each year. In anticipation of mass profit- loss, studios cut production schedules and terminated contracts with actors, producers, directors and other staff. Newly unemployed artists began pursuing careers in television, following earlier predecessors. As popular movie actors transitioned from the silver screen to the television screen, viewers followed their favorite artists to the new medium. In 1951, almost all cities with television stations saw a significant increase in movie theater closures corresponding with a simultaneous increase in television viewership.

It is part of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes. Lourdes is a major Catholic pilgrimage site and the Catholic Church endorses the belief that the Virgin Mary appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous there. The Basilica of St. Pius X is the largest and most controversial of the Domain's churches. It was completed in 1958 in anticipation of the enormous crowds expected in Lourdes for the centenary of the Apparitions. A modern, concrete building, it is almost entirely underground (part of the building lies beneath the Boulevard P√®re R√©mi Semp√© above). Dimensions and capacity The Basilica was designed by the architect Pierre Vago. The nave is oval, long and wide, and slopes gently upwards from the centre, where the sanctuary is situated on a raised platform. The ceiling is low, at only high, and is supported by 58 pre-stressed concrete pillars which meet 29 concrete beams which cross the ceiling, giving it the impression of an upturned ship. This design creates a very large open space, of , for maximum visibility from any part of the nave. When full it can accommodate up to 25,000 worshippers. Interior decoration On the walls there are 52 images in the gemmail style of overlapping stained glass. On the west ramp are the 15 traditional Mysteries of the Rosary, and on the east ramp are the Stations of the Cross, designed by Denys de Sol√®re. On the lower part of the east side is the series \\"Bernadette's Way of Light\\", based on sketches by Ren√© Margotton, which depict the eighteen apparitions together with two scenes from her life.

Black, 'Lowrie, William (1857‚Äì1933)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 10, Melbourne University Press, 1986, pp 160-161. Retrieved 2009-09-16 was an Australian agricultural educationist. Lowrie was the son of John Lowrie, a shepherd, wife Christina, n√©e Anderson. Lowrie was born near Galashiels, Selkirkshire, Scotland. Lowrie was brought up on a farm Clarilaw, one of the largest farms in Roxburghshire, and attended school at Blainslie; he later entered the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.A. in 1883, and obtaining a Highland and Agricultural Society's bursary in 1884, studied agriculture and graduated B.Sc. in 1886 with a prize in mathematics and several first-class honours. Lowrie lectured on natural science and agriculture at Gordon's College, Aberdeen. In 1887 he was appointed Professor at the Roseworthy Agricultural College, South Australia, after the sacking of John D. Custance, and continued his research into the virtues of fallowing and the use of water-soluble phosphates as fertilizer. Following this Lowrie travelled throughout the wheat-growing districts of South Australia, addressing farmers and endeavouring to persuade them to adopt his methods. He resigned his position as principal of Roseworthy Agricultural College after criticism of him in Parliament. He was urged to reconsider by the Agricultural and Horticultural Society and others. W. C. Grasby was appointed as Head Master, freeing Lowrie to concentrate on research and promulgation of modern farming methods and the resignation was withdrawn. He was contracted by the Victorian government to report on the Longerenong and Dookie agricultural colleges. His reports, which were constructive though highly critical, were not welcomed. He was made an honorary and contributing member of the R.A.& H.S.S.A. in 1898 as a show of confidence in him. In 1901 he left for a position in Canterbury, New Zealand as principal of the Lincoln Agricultural College, then in 1908 became Director of Agriculture in Western Australia where his brother-in-law, Newton Moore, was premier. In 1909 he declined the offer of the chair of agriculture at the University of Sydney. Lowrie returned to South Australia in 1911 as Director of Agriculture, following the resignation of Professor William Angus (and acting directorship of A. E. V. Richardson). Lowrie resigned in 1914 owing to differences of opinion with the Minister for Agriculture regarding the reorganization of the department. After his retirement Lowrie took up farming on 'Battunga', near Echunga, South Australia and specialized in farming and breeding pure-bred Border Leicester sheep. Lowrie died at Echunga on 20 July 1933 and was buried at St George's cemetery, Magill. Lowrie had married twice, firstly to Mary Longbottom on 24 June 1891; she died four months later after an ectopic pregnancy. On 23 March 1903 Lowrie married Alice Longbottom (Mary's sister) who survived him. There were no children. Lowrie did excellent work, especially in South Australia; no one else in his time did more to make farming profitable. A bust of him, by Marguerite Richardson, is at Roseworthy Agricultural College.

He is a Senior Fellow of the Discovery Institute, the organization that is the driving force behind the intelligent design movement. He was a frequent contributor to National Review, and a former columnist for the Jewish weekly newspaper The Forward, to which he still contributes occasional essays. Intelligent design Klinghoffer has published a series of articles, editorial columns, and letters to the editor in both Jewish and non-Jewish conservative publications seeking to promote the principle of intelligent design and to discredit Darwinian views of evolution. Klinghoffer believes that science can include support for an underlying intelligent design in the development of living things and the universe as a whole, and, indeed, that some scientists hold to such views. Larry Yudelson has responded, in a piece directed at Klinghoffer, that rabbinical Judaism has accepted evolutionary theory for more than a century, and that Judaism has never rejected science. Yudelson also argues that Klinghoffer's employer, the Discovery Institute, is a Christian think tank that is funded by organizations that seek to promote a \\"Christian-friendly world view\\". Religion Klinghoffer is an Orthodox Jew who has written a spiritual memoir about his religious background. He was raised in Reform Judaism by his adoptive parents, and formally converted to Orthodox Judaism, becoming ba'al tshuva (Hebrew, a newly religious Orthodox Jew). In his book, Why the Jews Rejected Jesus, Klinghoffer theorizes that Jewish rejection of Jesus allowed Christianity to separate from Judaism and become a multi-ethnic religion. Christianity was thus able to achieve a dominance in Gentile Europe that would have been impossible for Judaism to attain. To Klinghoffer, this changed world history, because Christianity was able to serve as a bulwark against the spread of Islam into Europe. In May 2010, the Discovery Institute released a free 105-page eBook titled Signature of Controversy: Responses to Critics of Signature in the Cell, edited by Klinghoffer, with chapters by Discovery Institute fellows David Berlinski, Casey Luskin, Stephen C.

The results is known as VR photograph (or VR photo), 360-degree photo, photo sphere, or spherical photo, as well as interactive panorama or immersive panorama. VR photography is the art of capturing or creating a complete scene as a single image, as viewed when rotating about a single central position. Normally created by stitching together a number of photographs taken in a multi-row 360-degree rotation or using an omnidirectional camera, the complete virtual reality image can also be a totally computer-generated effect, or a composite of photography and computer generated objects. The history of VR photography is human-computer interaction in which a real or imaginary environment is simulated and users interact with and manipulate that world. Capture There are several ways of capturing VR photography. Rectilinear stitching This involves the rotation of a digital camera, typically in the portrait (up and down) position and centered directly over the tripod. As the operator manually rotates the camera clockwise, the camera stops or clicks into a detent at regular intervals, such as every 30¬∞ of rotation. The rotator can be adjusted by changing the position of \\"detent ring or bolt,\\" into another slot, to alter the interval of rotation: 40¬∞, 60¬∞, 90¬∞ etc. If a given camera lens supports a wider view, one could select a larger detent value (for example, 60¬∞ instead of 30¬∞). With a larger detent interval, fewer images are needed to capture a complete panoramic scene. The photographer may only need to take 6 shots as opposed to 10 shots to capture the same panorama. The combination of a precision rotator and a digital camera allows the photographer to take rectangular \\"slices\\" of any scene (indoors or outdoors). With a typical point and shoot digital camera, the photographer will snap 8, 10, 12 or 14 slices of a scene. Using specialized \\"photo stitching\\" software, the operator then assembles the \\"slices\\" into a single rectangular image, typically 4,500 pixels to 6,000 pixels wide. This technique, while extremely time-consuming, has remained popular even through today as the required equipment, rotator heads and software are relatively inexpensive and easy to learn. A stitched panoramic view is also called \\"cylindrical\\"‚Äîas the resulting stitched panorama allows panning in a complete 360¬∞, but offers a limited vertical field of about 50¬∞ degrees above or below the horizon line. Spherical stitching This method requires the use of a \\"Fisheye lens\\" equipped digital SLR camera. The 2-shot fish eye camera system was made popular by IPiX in the mid-1990s and a two- shot rotator head that rotated and locked into 0¬∞ and 180¬∞ positions only. The camera was an Olympus or Nikon CoolPix camera and the lenses used were the Nikon FC-E8 or FC-E9 fish-eye lens. The IPiX 360 camera system enabled photographers to capture a full 360 X 360 floor to ceiling view of any scene with just 4 shots as opposed to the more time-consuming 8, 10, or 12-shot rectilinear produced panoramas described above. This type of virtual tour required more expensive virtual tour camera equipment including (for example) a Sigma 8mm f/3.5 lens which allowed photographers to set their rotator heads to 90¬∞ and capture a complete virtual tour of any scene in just 4 shots (0¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞, 270¬∞). Cubical stitching This technique was one of the first forms of immersive, floor to ceiling virtual tours. Apple Computer pioneered this with the release of Apple's QuickTime VR in the early 1990s. Free utility software such as Cubic Converter and others allowed photographers to stitch and convert their panoramas into a \\"cube\\" like box to achieve a complete 360 X 360 view. Today, this technique is considered rather \\"old school,\\" and spherical stitching has become more mainstream for producing these types of tours. One-shot optics Using one-shot panoramic optics one can create quick and easy panoramic videos and images such as the type used on the iPhone. Software Various software products can be used to create virtual tours. While programs such as Adobe Photoshop have new features that allow users to stitch images together, they only support \\"rectilinear\\" types of stitching. Photoshop cannot produce them as quickly or accurately as stitching software programs can such as Autodesk Stitcher. This is because there is sophisticated math and camera-lens profiles that are needed to create the desired panorama image which is based on your camera's depth of field (FOV) and the type of lens used. Cameras such as the Nikon D3 or D700 have a full frame digital SLR cameras, whereas the Nikon D90 or Canon T2i (Rebel line of Digital EOS cameras) have a smaller sensor. When full frame digital SLR cameras are used with a fish eye lens such as a Sigma 8mm F/3.5, a full circular image is captured. This allows you to shoot 2 or 3 shots per view to create a 360 X 360 stitched panoramic image. When used with a non full frame digital SLR camera like the Nikon D90 or Canon digital Rebel and similar cameras, 4-shots are required with the camera in the portrait position. The resulting image will have the left and right sides cropped off each of the 4 images and each of the four corners, creating a rounded image. Hardware Cameras with one lens These models are used with a fisheye lens. The lens bends the angle of the shot to take a larger radius of the selected subject. It is not possible to take a complete 360-degree picture with this technique because there is always a dead angle directly behind the lens. Cameras with two lenses 360-degree cameras with two lenses are probably the most common type, as they can accommodate a full 360-degree angle with two lenses facing each other. A camera takes pictures and videos with an angle of just over 180 degrees, e.g. 220 degrees. These are then converted into a 360-degree object using software. Problems are often caused by stitching errors. This means that an incorrect combination of the images can result in an unclean cut edge that is difficult or impossible to remove. Cameras with multiple lenses Depending on the application, manufacturers use more than two camera lenses to produce the images. One of the first cameras was the throwing camera \\"Panono\\". It has 36 cameras, which are triggered at the same time at the highest point, if the camera was thrown into the air. The more lenses are installed in the camera, the more difficult it becomes for the software to combine the individual images. The possible stitching problems are less with a good stitching. Camera rigs Camera rigs are mostly used for the attachment of 6 conventional Actioncams. GoPro produced one of the first camera rigs. They are available in different versions and connect several single cameras. The cameras are placed in this cube and record the surroundings in all directions. Mosaic based cameras If several \\"normal\\" cameras are combined in a network, one speaks of mosaic-based cameras. Each of these cameras records a small area of the environment. The individual images are then joined together like mosaic stones to form an omnidirectional overall image. The number of cameras to be used depends on the focal length of the lenses used. The smaller the focal length, the larger the angle of view and the fewer cameras are required. Display QuickTime VR (QTVR) was the original interactive panorama format, with Apple's Quicktime software acting as the viewer. Recent versions of Microsoft Windows also provide built-in support via the .pano file extension. There are also a growing number of different players and plug-ins. Many of these have been based on Flash, Java, SilverLight, and custom programming using OpenGL and WebGL, but 360 player development is now largely based in HTML5 and JavaScript. VR photography can also be used for displaying objects in 360 (360 product photography), commonly referred to as 360 Object VR, 360 product photography, 360 product images and 360 product views). These are created by capturing a series of images as the object rotates over a 360 rotation (camera stays in a fixed position). The output will be a series of individual images (typically JPG format) that can then be composed into an interactive 360 view, typically using HTML5 and JavaScript. 360 Object VR is commonly used in ecommerce.

It existed between 1908 and 1915, and was located on the northeastern edge of Lanfair Valley near the New York Mountains. The area is now in the Mojave National Preserve, directed by the National Park Service. History In late 1907, while a depression gripped the nation, three prospectors from Goldfield ‚Äì James Hart and the brothers Bert and Clark Hitt ‚Äì found pockets of rich gold ore in the Castle Mountains, approximately four miles south of the Barnwell & Searchlight Railroad. The strike was touted as the \\"Second Goldfield bonanza\\". In early 1908, prospectors swarmed to the strike. During the next few months, 700 people arrived, a camp was established, a telephone line was strung to Barnwell, the weekly newspaper Enterprise started up, a voting precinct and justice-court township were created, and a post office were established. By summer, Hart's 1,500 residents were served by the Norton House and Martin House Hotels, and the Star rooming house (flophouse). Other businesses included two general stores, (including the Hart-Gosney), the Ames Book and Cigar Store, a real- estate office, a candy store, two lumberyards, a bakery, eight saloons (including Hart and Hitt, C. Aguire, Arlington Club, Honest John, Oro Belle, and Northern Bar), and a brothel. There were telephone and telegraph services, and a water line. A miners' union was organized. A businessmen's league limited the sale of liquor, enforced police and fire regulations, and ousted gamblers and toughs. Hart and Hitt's original claim was sold by their promoter, Will Foster, to the Oro Belle Mining Company of Duluth, Minnesota in 1908 for $100,000. The mine was never profitable and shut down permanently in 1918.Snorf, D.N., ‚ÄúEarly Days at Hart; Being the Reminiscenses of John Sherwood Snorf as told to Dorothy (Nelson) Snorf‚Äù, 1991, Tales of the Mojave Road Publishing Company, Goffs Schoolhouse, Essex, CA; 208 pp. Illustrated. All the other mines had the same fate. The pockets of high-grade ore proved small, and mining declined as soon as 1909. The largest mine besides the Oro Belle was the Big Chief, originally called the Jumbo, also owned by the Hart brothers. A 10 Stamp mill was built at this mine. Other mines included the Twin Peaks, the Flyer, the Florence, the Zinc-Graf property, and the Todd Hunter lease. The Enterprise and other businesses closed. A fire wiped out much of the business district (largely deserted); the leading mines suspended work and the miners‚Äô union was disbanded. The court district and voting precinct were abolished, and the post office closed in late 1915.

She was found lying on sodden ground, caked in mud on the plains of Masailand by Samwel, an African game scout and Larry Wateridge.

Opened in September 1963 as a refuge for orphaned or sick wild animals, the park initially held less than thirty animals, with Ugas (who also starred in the movie Born Free) the only lion. By 1965 the park held 117 orphans of 36 species including lion, leopard, cheetahs, african buffalo, camels, hyena, jackal and wild dogs.Grindlay, Irene.

Velvet paws: the story of Mara, the young lioness. London: Robert Hale (1966) inside sleeve The Grindlays, as self- appointed guardians, remained in frequent contact.  Fame  Mara had only been in the Animal Orphanage for about six months when the Born Free film crew arrived. They were looking for lionesses to play the part of Elsa and decided that Mara would make an ideal adult Elsa. Seventeen lionesses were selected from across Africa and used to portray this famous big cat; their ages ranging from a few weeks to several years old. In total there were twenty-one lions and lionesses used during filming, with Mara the primary animal actor. Although Mara's size and weight required delicate handling on set, she was placid and easily directed. The Grindlays were regulars on set but were careful never to attend when Mara was filming because Mara had a tendency to stray towards them. Her affection for the Grindlays and theirs for her never waned.Grindlay, Irene. Velvet paws: the story of Mara, the young lioness. London: Robert Hale (1966) p.187  Life after Born Free  Once filming had completed, Mara returned to the Animal Orphanage, however the Board of Trustees of the Kenya National Parks became concerned regarding in the increase in the number of adoptees. They requested that Mara, Ugas and three younger lionesses be relocated to Whipsnade Park. The Grindlays, who maintained responsibility for Mara, eventually agreed to release Mara into the care of Whipsnade. While waiting to go to Whipsnade, reports surfaced that Ugas, Mara and three other lionesses were to be rehabilitated by George and Joy Adamson. The proposed experiment was heavily protested.Grindlay, Irene. Velvet paws: the story of Mara, the young lioness. London: Robert Hale (1966) p.188 The Grindlays were opposed to the idea because Mara's behaviour was that of a domesticated dog. Along with animal lovers, naturalists and experienced game wardens, they held the belief that integration back into the wild would harm Mara, rather than benefit. Mara did not fear man and indeed went out of her way to approach and play. This posed an enormous risk to her safety. In addition, release into the wild would place Mara and the other lionesses at risk of contracting Babesia. Domesticated animals have no resistance to the fatal disease, a fact which George and Joy Adamson knew. Their lion Elsa had died of the same disease not less than two years earlier when they had attempted to release her back into the wild.Grindlay, Irene. Velvet paws: the story of Mara, the young lioness. London: Robert Hale (1966) p.189 Eventually only Ugas was released into the Meru Game Reserve. It was decided that Mara was too tame and she and the other lionesses should be relocated to Whipsnade Park. Just prior to her departure Mara gave birth to male and female twin cubs, sired by Ugas during the filming of Born Free. In 1966, Irene Grindlay wrote a book titled Velvet Paws which detailed the life of Mara up to and including her appearance in the movie Born Free. > \\"We have no reason to reproach ourselves. We are quite convinced that we did > the right thing in opposing her release and that for many years to come in > Whipsnade Park she will be well-fed, contented and ... safe.\\" (Irene > Grindlay, 1966) It is not known how long Mara resided at Whipsnade Park. The life span of a lion in the wild is approximately 12 years, while those in captivity have been known to live for more than 20. If Mara was fortunate she would have died in the mid to late seventies.  Films  * The Lions Are Free is the real life continuation of the award-winning movie classic Born Free.

It was founded by Filipino playwright, translator, director, and educator Rolando S. Tinio, who also served as its Artistic Director. The company was dedicated to producing world classics in translation as well as notable Filipino plays, as it aimed to promote cultural development and support of the Filipino language through theater. Teatro Pilipino popularized a number of classic masterpieces among Filipino audiences by translating them into Filipino. Tinio believed that by presenting these works in translation, he was translating the philosophies and ideologies behind those plays as well. After a 1975 pilot season of two plays sponsored by the Department of Public Information and the Cultural Center of the Philippines, the company was formally introduced as one of two resident drama companies of the CCP. After a change in government in 1986, the new CCP Management decided to abandon the drama companies, forcing Teatro Pilipino to move to a new home at the old Metropolitan Theater (MET) at Lawton, near Downtown Manila. After the death of its principal actor, Dame Ella Luansing- Tinio in 1991, the curtain fell for the last time, after a performance of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (Ikalabing-Dalawang Gabi). The play was produced as a showcase for Unang Tagpo (National Theater Festival). Teatro Pilipino held annual summer workshops on acting, directing and stage management. Notable productions  Plays by Filipino playwrights staged by Teatro include Francisco Baltazar‚Äôs Orosman at Zafira (Orosman and Zafira), 1977; and those written by Tinio himself, such as May Katwiran ang Katwiran (Reason Has Its Reason), 1981, 1989; and Ang Babae sa Panitik (Women in Literature), 1991.

The court is divided into the Family Division and the General Division. The Family Division deals with family law cases including divorces, guardianships, adoptions and child welfare. The General Division deals with all other matters, including civil trials, probate law, indictable offences and applications for the review of decisions from certain administrative tribunals.  History of the Court  In May 1871 the legislature of Manitoba enacted The Supreme Court Act to establish a superior court with original and appellate jurisdiction in the province. The law provided: > There shall be constituted a Court of Justice for the Province of Manitoba, > to be styled \\"The Supreme Court,\\" which shall have jurisdiction over ail > matters of Law and Equity, ail matters of wills and intestacy, and shall > possess such powers and authorities in relation to matters of Local or > Provincial jurisdiction, as in England are distributed among the Superior > Courts of Law and Equity, and of Probate. The Act also established inferior courts known as Petty Sessions. In 1872, The Supreme Court Act was amended by the Manitoba legislature to change the name of the court to \\"The Court of Queen's Bench\\". The first Chief Justice was appointed in July 1872. In the same year, the Petty Sessions were abolished and County Courts were established. The appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Queen's Bench was transferred to the Manitoba Court of Appeal, which was established in 1906. In 1984, the County Courts were merged with the Court of Queen's Bench, and the judges of the County Courts became Court of Queen's Bench judges. Further, in 1984 the Family Division of the Court of Queen's Bench was established. Past Justices * Gordon J.

He is the author of Torn: Rescuing the Gospel from the Gays-vs.-Christians Debate, and the director of a 2009 documentary, Through My Eyes, which explores the struggles of young gay Christians. He is also known for founding the Gay Christian Network, which he ran from 2001 to 2017. Currently, he is the executive director of Nuance Ministries. In 2017, Lee announced his next book would be published by Penguin Random House on the subject of \\"fighting cultural polarization and talking to the people you disagree with.\\" That book was released in 2018 as Talking Across the Divide: How to Communicate with People You Disagree With and Maybe Even Change the World. Background Lee grew up in a conservative Christian home and continued identifying as an evangelical even after coming out as gay. According to The New York Times, \\"Justin Lee believes that the Virgin birth was real, that there is a heaven and a hell, that salvation comes through Christ alone and that he... is an evangelical Christian.\\" In 1997, after struggling to reconcile his own faith and sexuality, Lee posted his story online and heard from others who were similarly struggling. This led him to be more outspoken on behalf of LGBT Christians. Involvement with the Gay Christian Network In August 2001, Lee launched the Gay Christian Network (GCN), first as a small online community of gay Christians, and then as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization to provide resources and support to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Christians. The organization was notable for its welcoming of \\"Side B\\" gay and bi Christians who abstain from same-sex sexual relationships, despite Lee's own \\"Side A\\" (affirming) views. In an interview for CNN, Lee explained: > We're just trying to get people together who experience attraction to the > same sex, however they have handled that, and who love Jesus and say, OK, > you are welcome here, and then let's pray together and figure out where God > wants us to take it.Transcript of 18 December 2006 episode of Anderson > Cooper 360 In 2007, Lee discussed the organization's origins as an online community: > The Internet has made a huge difference in creating a movement [...]. What > at first might have seemed a little fringe group is then able to gain > momentum as people meet others and discover they‚Äôre not alone.Jeff McMillan, > Gays, lesbians join the chastity movement, Associated Press, 31 May 2007 By 2016, the organization had grown to the point that its conference was being promoted as \\"the largest annual LGBT Christian event\\" with an attendance of \\"1,500+ LGBT Christians and allies.\\" In 2017, Lee and the GCN board of directors announced in a joint statement that he would be leaving the organization \\"due to irreconcilable differences about the direction and future of the organization,\\" and that the organization's name would soon be changing. After his departure from GCN, Lee said he intended to continue doing LGBT Christian activism and announced the formation of a new nonprofit called Nuance Ministries. Fight against reparative therapy Lee has been an outspoken critic of the \\"ex-gay\\" or \\"reparative therapy\\" movement. In his book Torn, he discussed his own experience with the \\"ex-gay\\" movement in the 1990s, writing that \\"therapy can't make gay people straight...what's typically happening is behavior change, not orientation (that is, attraction) change.\\" In 2006, he appeared on the Dr. Phil Show to argue that attempting to change someone's orientation does not work. In 2012, Lee held a public conversation with Alan Chambers, then the president of \\"ex-gay\\" organization Exodus International, in which Lee argued that Exodus was hurting people and being dishonest about their results. Chambers then admitted that > The majority of people whom I have met, and I would say the majority meaning > 99.9 percent of them, have not experienced a change in their orientation or > have gotten to a place where they can say that they could never be tempted > or are not tempted in some way, or experience some level of same-sex > attraction. A year later, when Exodus announced that they would be closing, Lee wrote, \\"As a Christian, I grew up believing groups like Exodus could make me straight. Even years after I realized that didn't work, I continued to hear from friends and family who pushed me to keep trying to change my orientation. Exodus's announcement today is the acknowledgement many of us have been waiting to hear for a long, long time.\\"  \\"Side A\\"/\\"Side B\\" dialogue  Lee engages in frequent public dialogues with Spiritual Friendship co-founders Ron Belgau and Wesley Hill in which Lee takes a \\"Side A\\" position (arguing for monogamous same-sex relationships) and Belgau or Hill takes a \\"Side B\\" position (arguing for celibacy). Other notable details Lee is recognizable for his baldness and noticeable lack of eyebrows due to alopecia areata, a condition he has had since childhood.

He worked as a reserve umpire in the National League (NL) from 1991 to 1993 and returned to the NL in 1999. Since 2000, he has worked in both major leagues. Cuzzi wore number 99 when his career started; he now wears number 10. Career=Minor league umpiring Cuzzi appeared in the New York‚ÄìPenn League, Carolina League, South Atlantic League, Southern League, Triple-A Alliance, International League, American Association, Florida State League, and Eastern League before his promotion to the major leagues. Major league career Cuzzi made his major league debut on June 4, 1991, umpiring at first base in an 11-inning game between the St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers. From 1991 through 1993, Cuzzi umpired a total of 71 National League games. Cuzzi's umpiring career temporarily came to a halt in 1993. Although he had advanced to Class AAA baseball and served as an MLB reserve umpire, by that year there were no full-time major league slots for Cuzzi and he was released. Cuzzi subsequently worked as a substitute teacher and bartender. While working at a hotel bar in 1996, he had a chance meeting with NL president Len Coleman, who allowed him to resume umpiring if he would work his way back up from the low minor leagues. In 1999, Cuzzi returned to the NL, working 49 games. Since 2000, when MLB combined umpiring staffs, he has worked games in both leagues. From 2000 through 2015, Cuzzi worked at least 116 games each season. Through the end of the 2016 season, Cuzzi has worked 2,428 major league regular season games, and has issued 78 ejections. =Notable games= Cuzzi has worked the Wild Card Game in 2013 and the Division Series in 2003, 2004, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2016. He has umpired in the National League Championship Series in 2005, 2014 and 2019. Cuzzi was also the plate umpire for Game 1 of the 2017 World Series. He also worked the 2008 All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium and the 2019 All-Star Game at Progressive Field in Cleveland. In Game 1 of the 2015 National League Division Series between the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals, Cuzzi's wide strike zone was criticized by some Cubs players and media for contributing to their 4‚Äì0 loss. Cuzzi has umpired in at least three MLB no-hitters. He was behind the plate for Bud Smith's no-hitter on September 3, 2001, and for Cole Hamels' no-hitter on July 25, 2015.MLB - Boxscore - Phillies v Cubs _ Philly He was the third base umpire when San Francisco Giants pitcher Jonathan S√°nchez no- hit the San Diego Padres on July 10, 2009.Sanchez makes most of opportunity, throws no-hitter in front of father ESPN.com.

During the game, eight members of the Rays were ejected (seven by Cuzzi), but no Boston players were thrown out, something that reportedly had never happened before.

This call proved to be costly as the Twins lost the game 4‚Äì3 on a walk-off home run in the bottom half of the inning. On August 17, 2019, Cuzzi was umpiring at first base when he ejected Yankees CC Sabathia and Brett Gardner. Prior to Gardner's ejection, Yankees manager Aaron Boone was ejected by home-plate umpire Ben May. After Boone returned to the dugout, Gardner was seen hitting the top of the Yankees dugout with his bat, an action that had gotten him ejected on August 9 by Chris Segal. In ejecting Gardner, Cuzzi demonstrated the action by Gardner which earned him his ejection, holding a phantom bat and jabbing it against a phantom dugout roof.

All major web browsers provide support to browser toolbar development as a way to extend the browser's GUI and functionality. Browser toolbars are considered to be a particular kind of browser extensions that present a toolbar. Browser toolbars are specific to each browser, which means that a toolbar working on a browser does not work on another one. All browser toolbars must be installed in the corresponding browser before they can be used, and require updates when new versions are released. Many high-profile browser toolbars released over the years have been fraught with problems, either intentionally as malware or injected with computer viruses or due to poor or conflicting programming when considering multiple toolbars being included on the single browser. Controversy During the 2000s there was a proliferation of browser add-ons produced and released by a variety of software companies, both large and small, which were designed to extend the browsing experience for the end user. Due to this popularity, and the ease with which users could have these installed, there was additionally an adoption by malware, adware and other privacy-invasive tracking tools. The popularity of browser toolbars has since declined. Many unscrupulous companies use software bundling to force users downloading one program to also install a browser toolbar, some of which invade the user's privacy by tracking their web history and search history online. Many antivirus companies refer to these programs as grayware or Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs).  Developing a toolbar  The programming language and development tools behind a browser toolbar vary from one browser to another. In Internet Explorer 5 or later toolbars may be created as browser extensions written in C# or C++. More specifically, it is possible to create up to three different kinds of toolbars (custom explorer bars, tool bands and desk bands) and to combine them with browser helper objects in order to provide added functionality. In Firefox toolbars can be created as add-ons that contribute to the GUI by extending the browser with XUL (support for XUL was removed in Firefox version 57). The logic behind the toolbar is written in JavaScript running under expanded privileges.Javascript running under expanded privileges Mozilla Jetpack can be used to simplify the development of add-ons for Firefox. In Safari 5 or later toolbars can be created as extensions that add bars and buttons. The logic behind the toolbar is written in JavaScript with access to a special JavaScript API to interact with the Safari application and web content. In Google Chrome 4 or later toolbars can be created as extensionsGoogle Chrome Extensions that add browser actionsBrowser Actions in Google Chrome to the browser window. The logic behind the toolbar is written in JavaScript with access to a special JavaScript APISpecial JavaScript API from Google Chrome's Extension Reference Guide to interact with the Chrome application and web content. The privileges under which a Chrome extension runs are governed by a set of permissions.Google Chrome Extension Permissions In Opera 11 or later toolbars can be created as extensions that add buttons to the browser window. The logic behind the toolbar is written in JavaScript with access to a special JavaScript API to interact with the Opera application and web content. In Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera toolbar styling is done though CSS.  Native vs. injected toolbars  Some major browsers (Internet Explorer and Firefox) enable the creation of native toolbars i.e., toolbars which are directly inserted in the browser window. Examples of native toolbars are Google Toolbar and Stumbleupon Toolbar. Native toolbars use browser-specific code to create the same toolbar for each different browser version. Some toolbar developers use a different approach and make the browser extension inject a JavaScript file in every web page visited by the user. All major browsers support injected toolbars. The code in this file inserts the toolbar as a part of the DOM in every web page. Injected toolbars use essentially the same JavaScript code to draw the toolbar for each different browser version. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages for the different stakeholders. From the user's perspective: * Native toolbars present faster load times, since injected toolbars must wait for the DOM to be created in order to insert the toolbar in it. * Injected toolbars require less frequent updates because part of their code is dynamically downloaded in the JavaScript file that draws the toolbar. From the developer's perspective: * Injected toolbars allow for shorter development times since the JavaScript code that creates the toolbar may be written once for all browsers. * Injected toolbars allow for an easier toolbar update policy, since changes that are made in the injected JavaScript code do not require releasing a new toolbar version. From the toolbar owner's perspective: * Injected toolbars consume requests to download the JavaScript code that inserts the toolbar in every page, while native toolbars consume no such requests.  Cross-browser toolbar development  Another way to simplify the task of developing a toolbar for different browsers is to rely on a cross-browser extension development framework. Some of the most important frameworks are listed below: * Toolbar Studio supports IE, Firefox. This is an IDE that allows to develop toolbars via a visual editor. * Neobars supports Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari and Opera. This is an online web constructor for cross-browser extensions. Multiple widgets like Weather, RSS, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook components are available. The platform is free to use. * Add-ons Framework supports IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera. This SDK allows to build browser add-ons using common JavaScript API. * Kynetx supports IE, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, but extensions are dependent on the Kynetx extension to work. In addition, Kynetx apps are built using a proprietary Kynetx Rules Language. There is no cost to use the Kynetx platform. * CrossRider supports IE, Firefox, Chrome and Safari. CrossRider is JavaScript and jQuery-based. Crossrider also provides auto-update mechanism for code, full stats with country / browser breakdown and different publishing tools to market your extension and host it on your own website. Crossrider have recently launched an online real-time IDE for developing cross browser extensions with out the need to download an SDK. It's a free service with 24/7 support. * KangoExtensions supports IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera. Kango is only free for open source non-profitable projects. * Conduit supports IE, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. It enables you creating a branded, customized toolbar that offers users a direct interface or ‚ÄúConduit‚Äù to the most valuable and important segments and links of your Blog or website. Conduit is free, easy to use and allows you to monetize your toolbar with a shared-profit revenue model. Since Conduit basically lets you link from a toolbar a portion of your web page, it inherently lacks from the flexibility of other cross- browser extension development frameworks. * Widdit's toolbar supports IE, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. The Widdit platform allows publishers to create a free, customized branded toolbar using a drag and drop online wizard. Through the admin, publishers can add or remove applications and features in real time, and share the toolbar with different communities. * ExtensionMaker supports Firefox, Opera and Chrome. The Extension Maker is a desktop-based tool that allows to create stylish and powerful browser extensions using a drag and drop.  Removing a browser toolbar  Most of the larger toolbar providers have a toolbar uninstaller or directions for how to remove their toolbars.Removing a Yahoo Toolbar This process varies by browser type, version, OS, and toolbar provider. Some toolbar providers do not give detailed instructions on how to remove their toolbars.

On 24 March 2016, he was appointed for the sixth year running as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dr Shaheed is also the Chairperson of the Geneva- based international human rights think-tank, Universal Rights Group, which was launched in January 2014. Prior to his appointment as a UN envoy with the rank of Assistant Secretary General, he was a Maldivian politician and human rights defender. He served as Maldivian Minister of Foreign Affairs from November 2008 to December 2010; previously, he had served as Minister of Foreign Affairs for two years, from 14 July 2005 until August 20, 2007. In March 2014, while he was United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran refused him entry to the country and declared him to be an agent of both the CIA and Israel. On 13 June 2016, Shaheed was nominated by the Consultative Group of Ambassadors comprising Albania, Brazil, Egypt, France and Thailand, as the most suitable candidate to be appointed by the President of the Human Rights Council for the post of United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, to succeed Professor Heiner Bielefeldt of Germany. Political & Diplomatic career A career diplomat since 1982, Shaheed served as the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Maldives from 1998 to 2004. As Permanent Secretary of Maldives, he actively lobbied to widen and deepen regional cooperation within South Asia, incorporating discussions on human rights, regional peace, and free trade into the agenda of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation, including the pursuit of a South Asian Social Charter. Prior to his appointment as Permanent Secretary, he had served, from 1997 to 1998, as a member of the Group of South Asian Eminent Persons, appointed by the Heads of State of the South Asian region.http://www.fesnepal.org/reports/2006/seminar_reports/SAARC%202015.pdf At the national level, in 2003, Shaheed also secured political approval for the creation of Maldives National Human Rights Commission, which was established in November 2003, and for accession to the UN Convention against Torture, as part of the human rights-related reforms the government embarked on in late 2003. At the end of 2003, Shaheed retired from the diplomatic service and took up a position in the President's Office mandated to formulate and coordinate political and human rights reform as well as government communications, following outbreaks of civil unrest in the capital and nearby areas. In July 2005, Shaheed used his position as Government Spokesperson to reject the condemnation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the Chief Justice of the Maldives. The Opposition MDP accused him of being the chief \\"spin doctor\\" for President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom while independent human rights NGOs such as Hama Jamiyya hail him as a champion of human rights. He is one of the co-founders of New Maldives, a group within the former regime who spearheaded the drive to make the Maldives a modern liberal democracy. Together with his cabinet colleague, Dr. Hassan Saeed, Shaheed is the author of the Roadmap for Reform, unveiled on 27 March 2006, identifying a raft of political and legal reforms with specific timeframes. Shaheed is also the founder of the Open Society Association dedicated to the promotion of human rights, tolerance, and democracy. Although a very high-profile sponsor of the DRP, he was defeated in his bid to win the Vice Presidency of the Party in April 2006. After resigning from the Cabinet, Shaheed and Saeed claimed to have faced intimidation and harassment as they actively lobbied against the regime, including by contesting in the presidential elections, with duo missing on the run-off by finishing third in the first round of elections. However, their campaigning against the Gayoom regime was instrumental in forcing a free and fair election. Shaheed offered \\"unconditional support\\" for the candidature of the opposition candidate, Mohamed Nasheed, in the run-off, and was appointed as his Foreign Minister when the latter won the presidency in October 2008. Human rights advocacy While inaugurating a workshop conducted by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in March 2007, Dr. Shaheed took credit for all the steps taken by the Maldives to subscribe to the core international human rights treaties, including treaties that allowed Maldivians to petition the UN treaty bodies. He also claimed credit for the establishment of the Maldives Human Rights Commission in accordance with the Paris Principles. Shaheed had come under strident criticism for his advocacy of international human rights norms, such as extending standing invitations to United Nations Human Rights special mandates to visit Maldives and hosting of a UN Human Rights Advisor in Maldives. Shaheed's advocacy of an open society and strong anti-corruption measures were vehemently opposed by the President's brother, Abdulla Yameen and his supporters who mounted a series of motions of censure against Shaheed in parliament July‚ÄìAugust 2007.Koimalaa Resignation On August 21, 2007, Shaheed resigned as Foreign Minister ahead of a second due motion of no- confidence against him tabled in the Majlis, which followed criticism of the Majlis by Shaheed, who said that it had failed the people.\\"Maldivian foreign minister resigns, citing argument with Parliament\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), August 21, 2007.\\"Maldives foreign minister quits\\", BBC News, August 21, 2007. Shaheed said that \\"a conservative guard within the parliament and cabinet\\" was resisting reform. His resignation followed his open criticism of the parliament for having failed to protect the fundamental rights of the people and for being a rubber stamp to sustain the 30-year-old rule of President Gayoom. In his resignation statement, he called on the President to step down voluntarily and expressed frustration over the slow pace of the reform program. Writing in 2012, well-known international human rights activist and Deputy Chairman of the UK Conservative Party's Human Rights Commission, Benedict Rogers had described Shaheed as \\"the lead reformer\\" in the Maldives. Re-appointment After Gayoom was defeated in the October 2008 presidential election, his successor, Mohamed Nasheed, reappointed Shaheed as Foreign Minister in November 2008. His second stint as Foreign Minister was no less controversial than the first, coming under fire from the parliament and radical Islamist parties for recognition of Kosovo as an independent State, the development of cooperation with Israel and the participation in the US programme to close down Guantanamo Bay detention facility by agreeing to relocate persons released from Gitmo. An advocate of close security ties with India, he was also widely criticized by pro-Pakistani Islamist elements. As Foreign Minister, Shaheed had also agreed to a moratorium on corporal punishment, including flogging, and to protect LGBT community in Maldives against discrimination, during the universal periodic review of Maldives held in Geneva on 3 November 2010. Amnesty International's Annual Report in 2011 described Dr Shaheed as the \\"leading human rights defender\\" in the Maldives.  International career  In May 2010, Maldives was elected to the UN Human Rights Council, securing the highest number of votes ever gained by a country. Earlier, from 1997 to 1998, Shaheed had served as a member of the Group of Eminent Persons mandated by the leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, comprising Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, while from 2009-2010 he served on the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group mandated to oversee the protection of democratic values and human rights in the 54 member association of former British colonies. On June 17, 2011 Shaheed was appointed as special rapporteur on the Human Rights Situation in Iran by the Human Rights Council of the United Nations. However, for the first time since 2011, the Maldives, with Abdulla Yameen as president, refused to back Shaheed's re-appointment in 2014 as UN envoy, despite public appeals from Iranian civil society. From 2010 to 2012, Shaheed had been the lead investigator of an alleged 800 million dollar fraud by current President Yameen, filing court cases in Singapore High Court through the UK fraud investigator Grant Thornton and Singapore solicitors Rajah and Tan. In September 2013, he stirred considerable animosity from President Yameen when he called for international intervention to facilitate presidential elections when the first round was nullified by the Supreme Court of Maldives. On 23 March 2016, the Human Rights Council voted to extend Dr Shaheed's UN mandate to investigate human rights abuses in the Islamic Republic of Iran for a 6th year, again without the support of his country, the Maldives. The Maldives' failure to support Dr Shaheed this time was explained by a leading government MP as based on his opposition to the re- introduction of the death penalty in the Maldives after a 63-year-old moratorium. Living in self-imposed exile since the coup d'√©tat of February 2012, Shaheed has been a vociferous campaigner for the restoration of democracy and for advancement of human rights in Maldives. He has also been active on the international stage advocating human rights protection in Islamic societies, supporting freedom of religion and the abolition of the death penalty. The official newspaper of the Islamist party in Maldives declared in February that Shaheed was the foremost apostate in Maldives. In April 2013, Shaheed was a Guest of Honour at the launch of the launch of the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office's 2012 Human Rights and Democracy Report. In September 2012, Shaheed joined the Human Rights Centre at the University of Essex as a visiting professor. He teaches human rights, Islam and diplomacy. He is also a Visiting Professor at the City University of New York. In August 2015, The Guardian reported Iran uses fabricated WikiLeaks cable to smear UN rights rapporteur. It said \\"Iranian articles claimed that the Saudi embassy in Kuwait had paid the UN envoy $1m to take an anti-Iran position.  Awards and Honours  On 5 May 2009, the Washington-based think-tank, Centre for the Study of Islam and Democracy conferred their annual Muslim Democrat of the Year Award to Shaheed. The citation for the award read that it was being given to Shaheed in recognition of his \\"role in building democracy and preserving it in the face of hardship, for promoting tolerance and harmony, and for opening a window into a century of reason, freedom, human rights and democracy in the Maldives and in South Asia.\\" On 4 November 2010, the President of Albania awarded him the Presidential Medal of Gratitude for his contribution to the promotion of peace in the Balkans. On 3 November 2015, Dr Shaheed, along with the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon was a recipient of the Global Leadership Awards for advancing human rights. As the recipient of the prestigious Leo Nevas Human Rights Award, Dr Shaheed's citation read: ‚ÄúFor a lifetime of achievement effectively advancing human rights in his own country and abroad, through citizen action, governmental support for that action, and through the United Nations. For his personal courage and conviction and his steadfast support for human rights for all.‚Äù Personal life Shaheed was educated at the University of Aberystwyth, UK before he obtained his PhD in International Relations at the University of Queensland, Australia. He now lives in England, as Visiting Professor of Human Rights Practice at the University of Essex.

Research and teachings Wyckoff implemented his methods in the financial markets, and grew his wealth such that he eventually owned nine and a half acres and a mansion next door to the Hamptons estate of General Motors president Alfred Sloan in Great Neck, New York. As Wyckoff became wealthier, he also became altruistic about the public's Wall Street experience. He turned his attention and passion to education, teaching, and in publishing expos√©s such as ‚ÄúBucket Shops and How to Avoid Them‚Äù, which were run in New York's The Saturday Evening Post starting in 1922. Continuing as a trader and educator in the stock, commodity and bond markets throughout the early 1900s, Wyckoff was curious about the logic behind market action. Through conversations, interviews and research of the successful traders of his time, Wyckoff augmented and documented the methodology he traded and taught. Wyckoff worked with and studied them all, himself, Jesse Livermore, E. H. Harriman, James R. Keene, Otto Kahn, J.P. Morgan, and many other large operators of the day. Wyckoff's research claimed many common characteristics among the greatest winning stocks and market campaigners of the time. He analyzed these market operators and their operations, and determined where risk and reward were optimal for trading. He emphasized the placement of stop-losses at all times, the importance of controlling the risk of any particular trade, and he demonstrated techniques used to campaign within the large trend (bullish and bearish). The Wyckoff technique may provide some insight as to how and why professional interests buy and sell securities, while evolving and scaling their market campaigns with concepts such as the \\"Composite Operator\\". The original Wyckoff Stock Market Course has been updated throughout the years and maintained by the company Richard Wyckoff himself created, the Wyckoff Stock Market Institute.Wyckoff Stock Market Institute Wyckoff was thorough in his analysis of the trading range. One tool that Wyckoff provides is the concept of the composite operator. Simply, Wyckoff felt that an experienced judge of the market should regard the whole story that appears on the tape as though it were the expression of a single mind. He felt that it was an important psychological and tactical advantage to stay in harmony with this omnipotent player. Wyckoff believed investors would be better prepared to grow their portfolios and net worth by following in his footsteps Personal life Wyckoff married three times: first in 1892 to Elsie Suydam; second to Cecelia G. Shear, and third to Alma Weiss. Wyckoff charged in 1928 that his second wife, whom the media dubbed a prima donna of Wall Street, had wrested control of the Magazine of Wall Street from him by \\"cajolery.\\" The separation ended in an agreement by which he received half a million dollars of the magazine company's bonds. Death According to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle newspaper (published Monday March 12, 1934), Wyckoff died on March 7, 1934, in Sacramento, California. His body was taken to a funeral chapel in Brooklyn, New York. See also *Jay Gould *James Keene *Ralph Nelson Elliott References *The Richard D.

Las Cruces, NM in the foreground). The Mesilla Valley is a geographic feature of Southern New Mexico and far West Texas. It was formed by repeated heavy spring floods of the Rio Grande. The fertile Mesilla Valley extends from Radium Springs, New Mexico, to the west side of El Paso, Texas. The valley is quite fertile, and is characterized by its few remaining bosques, as well as its native cottonwood trees, and increasingly, by invasive tamarisk, which was introduced in the late 19th century, and is known locally as salt cedar. Due to the fertile nature of the valley, agriculture is a very important activity in this area. Stahmann Farms owns the world's largest pecan orchard, is located south of the city of Las Cruces, New Mexico. Alfalfa, cotton, chile, onions and corn are other important cash crops grown in the Mesilla Valley. The Mesilla Valley is also known for its wine-producing capabilities, which originated with the Spanish exploration into New Mexico. It was part of Mexico until Gadsden Purchase in 1853.

In the U.S. state of New York, I-90 extends from the Pennsylvania state line at Ripley to the Massachusetts state line at Canaan, and is the second-longest highway in the state after NY 17. Although most of the route is part of the tolled New York State Thruway, two non-tolled sections exist along I-90 (the first, situated outside of Buffalo, is included in the Thruway system; the second, situated in the Capital District, is not part of the Thruway system and links Albany and its eastern suburbs). Within New York, I-90 has a complete set of auxiliary Interstates, which means that there are interstates numbered I-190 through I-990 in the state, with no gaps in between. For most of its length in New York, I-90 runs parallel to the former Erie Canal route, New York State Route 5 (NY 5), U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and the CSX railroad mainline that traverses the state. I-90 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. In New York, it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany, from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that bypassed the Berkshire Connector to the north. Ultimately, the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in Schodack, and I-90 was assigned to the segment of the Connector east of the proposed freeway. The Albany‚ÄìSchodack freeway was completed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s and fully open by 1977.  Route description = New York State Thruway  West of Albany, I-90 in New York is designated along the mainline of the New York State Thruway. The Thruway begins at the Pennsylvania state line in Chautauqua County, following the shore of Lake Erie northeast and passes through the town of Cheektowaga, a large suburb of Buffalo directly east of the city. Two auxiliary routes, I-190 (leading to Niagara Falls and connecting into Canada as Ontario Highway 405) and I-290 (a northerly bypass of Buffalo) connect with I-90 here. Both auxiliary routes provide access between I-90 and Canada's largest city, Toronto. East of Erie County, the Thruway turns east and passes through the suburbs of several major cities in Upstate New York, generally following the path of the Erie Canal. It passes south of Rochester and north of Syracuse, which are served by three auxiliary Interstate Highways: I-490 and I-390 connect to Rochester, while I-690 leads to Syracuse. The speed limit, enforced by the New York State Police, is 65 miles per hour along most of this stretch. Approaching exit 54 on I-90 westbound in West Seneca East of Syracuse, the Thruway follows the Erie Canal and, later, the Mohawk River into the Mohawk Valley toward Utica, where I-90 skirts the northern edge of downtown and meets I-790, a short route leading into the city's center. Farther east, the freeway indirectly serves the canal and riverside cities of Little Falls (via NY 169) and Amsterdam (NY 30) on its way to Schenectady, where I-890 splits from the Thruway and serves as the connection to the city center. It rejoins I-90 in Albany County, where I-90 leaves the mainline of the Thruway at exit 24 in Albany, which is signed for I-87 north and I-90 east. Here, the route designation of the Thruway changes from I-90 east to I-87 south. Traffic intending to continue on I-90 or reach I-87 north must exit the Thruway here. Exit numbers and mile markers for I-90 reset after exiting.  Albany and Rensselaer counties  Guilderland Service Area The Albany‚ÄìSchodack section of I-90‚Äîthe only portion of I-90 in New York that is not part of the Thruway system‚Äîbegins concurrent with I-87 and heads southeast from Thruway exit 24 to a toll barrier that, for now, marks the end of tolls along the freeway. Now a toll-free highway, I-90 and I-87 continue to exits 1N and 1S, which are for the Adirondack Northway (I-87) and Fuller Road Alternate (unsigned NY 910F), respectively. Located off exit 1S and Fuller Road Alternate, a spur of the Northway leading to Western Avenue (US 20), is the Crossgates Mall in Guilderland. I-90 proceeds eastward, meeting Washington Avenue at an interchange connecting to UAlbany, a state university, eastbound and Fuller Road (County Route 156 or CR 156) westbound. Exits 3 and 4, located apart in an area bounded by Washington and Central (NY 5) avenues, lead to the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus and the New York State Police Academy (exit 3) and to the Crosstown Arterial (NY 85 at exit 4). I-90 subsequently crosses over NY 5 and passes north of Westgate Plaza as it connects to Everett Road (CR 155). The freeway continues along the northern edge of Albany to exit 5A, a large trumpet interchange originally built to serve I-687. After that project was cancelled, it was repurposed as an exit for Corporate Woods Boulevard. East of exit 5A, I-90 passes by slightly more residential areas ahead of a stack interchange with US 9 north of downtown Albany. Albany Memorial Hospital is located just north of the exit on US 9. The stack interchange between I-90 and US 9 in Albany as seen from I-90 eastbound Not far to the east of US 9 is a second stack interchange, connecting I-90 to I-787 in the industrial northeasternmost section of the city of Albany. At this point, I-90 turns to the southeast and follows the Patroon Island Bridge over the Hudson River and into Rensselaer County. Across the river, I-90 becomes the Rensselaer County Veterans Memorial Highway and passes through much less developed areas. In its first in the county, the freeway meets Washington Avenue at the northern edge of the city of Rensselaer and the west end of NY 43 in the town of North Greenbush, southwest of US 4 and Defreestville. South of NY 43, I-90 and US 4 follow parallel routings into East Greenbush, where I-90 directly connects to US 4 at exit 9. I-90 heads southeastward across an undeveloped, forested section of the county, crossing over NY 151 and entering the town of Schodack, where it meets Miller Road, a connector between I-90 and the concurrent routes of US 9 and US 20\\\\. The freeway and the overlapping U.S. Routes follow similar routings to Schodack Center, at which point I-90 finally connects to US 9 and US 20 at exits 11E and 11W. I-90 heads due south from this point, passing over NY 150 and paralleling US 9, which splits from US 20 at Schodack Center. The routes cross paths again at exit 12 just north of where I-90 rejoins the Thruway system at a toll barrier preceding exit B1 of the Berkshire Connector.  Berkshire Connector  I-90 heads southeast on the Connector, meeting the north end of the Taconic State Parkway in the Columbia County town of Chatham at exit B2 and NY 22 at exit B3 in the town of Canaan from the Massachusetts state line. The Berkshire Connector ends at the state line; however, I-90 continues southeast into Massachusetts as the Massachusetts Turnpike.  History  Overhead signage for exit 24 in Albany, where I-90 leaves the Thruway mainline to serve downtown Albany. The Berkshire Connector (I-90) near exit B2 in Chatham The east‚Äìwest corridor I-90 follows across New York has always been major, followed by the Genesee Trail (1790s), Erie Canal (1825), New York Central Railroad (1853), and later the Yellowstone Trail (1912), which became US 20 and NY 5\\\\. It was planned as part of a nationwide toll road system as early as 1938.

This highway, passing Utica, Syracuse, and Rochester on its path between Albany and Buffalo, would provide construction jobs in the post-World War II period.Statement by Assemblyman Moffat and Senator Hampton Relative to the Establishment of a State Thruway System, March 13, 1942, New York Legislative Document, 1942, v. 15 no. 80‚Äì82, p. 153 The Berkshire Thruway, a branch east from near Albany to Massachusetts, was authorized in 1944, completing the east‚Äìwest route across the state. However, construction, which began in 1946, proceeded very slowly, with only one four-mile (6 km) portion open by 1950, when a law created the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA) to operate the route as a toll road. Construction then progressed much more rapidly, especially after 1954, when the authority was allowed to issue bonds not backed by the state (thus having higher interest rates). The roadway was completed between Buffalo and Albany in 1954, to New York City in 1956, to Pennsylvania in 1957, and to Massachusetts in 1959. In the meantime, the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act was enacted in 1956, promising a toll-free network of Interstate Highways throughout the nation. The Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) commissioner soon announced that the toll road met all federal Interstate Highway standards, and on August 14, 1957, most of the mainline of the Thruway was incorporated into the system as part of Interstates 87 and 90\\\\. Most of the connecting Massachusetts Turnpike was also included, but a more northerly alignment, avoiding the Berkshire Thruway, was proposed by the states of New York and Massachusetts for I-90 through Albany past Pittsfield to East Lee, Massachusetts. This alignment would be about 30% shorter than the all-toll alignment, and would provide relief to the four-lane Castleton Bridge on the Berkshire Thruway, which had been built narrower than the rest of the system because of the planned parallel alternate.Highway Cost Estimates: Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Public Works, 1958, p. 173 The BPR objected to the duplication, which would cost over $90 million, and refused to approve this alignment.U.S. Congress, Miscellaneous Highway Legislation, 1961, p. 112 The eventual route ran southeast from Albany to the Berkshire Thruway at the Nassau interchange, providing Albany with an alternate route and additional bridge, but not offering any savings in distance, and creating a \\"toll trap\\" for drivers accessing the Taconic State Parkway from Albany. Construction on the route of I-90 through Albany began , with both ends at existing Thruway interchanges: exit 24, which crossed the Adirondack Northway (I-87) at a cloverleaf interchange and connected to Washington Avenue in western Albany, and exit B1, which connected to US 9 near Nassau. Work on the freeway began at the Northway and progressed southeasterly to the Berkshire Connector in Rensselaer County. The portion between the Northway and Everett Road was opened to traffic in the mid-1960s while the piece extending from Everett Road to US 4 east of Rensselaer was completed in the early 1970s. The last section of the highway was completed to US 9 and US 20 in Schodack Center and finished by 1977. The Northway cloverleaf was rebuilt in the late 1980s. In 1999, the New York State Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration and NYSTA discussed redesignating the Berkshire Connector as I-90 and redesignating the non-toll part of I-90 from Thruway exit 24 to exit B1 on the Connector as I-88. The section of the Thruway between exits 25 and 24 would then be co-designated as both I-90 and I-88. This was never implemented.  Exit list  The mileposts below for the non-Thruway section follow actual signage, where mile 0.00 is located just east of the toll booths for exit 24 of the Thruway.

Note: SacTown's Smooth Vibe, hosted by Leon Guidry, blends the softer side of soul with urban and smooth Jazz. Sunday's noon till 6pm (PST) Coverage When KDEE-LP was launched, it was originally on 97.7 FM, and could only be heard in the eastern part of Sacramento County at the most; it is not heard over the air too well in Sacramento proper, especially the African American community. However, this situation has been somewhat remedied: they have since launched a webcast. In 2011, KDEE-LP was moved to 97.5 FM and the transmitter was moved to provide better coverage. The terrestrial signal now covers the Sacramento metropolitan area and several outlining areas such as Davis, Elk Grove, Roseville, and Natomas.

The series began serialization in Margaret magazine in 2002 and ran until 2007. The individual chapters have been collected into fifteen tank≈çbon volumes by Shueisha; the first on March 25, 2003 and the last on August 24, 2007. The series has been licensed by Viz Media for an English-language North American release as part of their Shojo Beat imprint. Plot The story takes place in the Tensh≈ç Era of Japan. Usagi is a bumbling ninja-in-training in her village in southern Iga. Though she is already fifteen, she is a terrible ninja and has made no progress whatsoever. As a result, her grandfather gives her a special mission: to go to Segachi, marry Hanz≈ç Hattori, the leader of the main branch ninja family, and bear his child. She is accompanied by Mamezo, her longtime friend, companion, and foster child. Once they arrive it becomes apparent that Hanz≈ç has no intention of marrying anyone, and worse yet, it seems Usagi has a much more refined rival. It is clear that as Usagi spends more time with Hanz≈ç, she is growing on him, though the fact that he is constantly bombarded with new potential brides makes Usagi self-conscious. Characters ;Usagi Momochi :She is a young ninja-in-training who seeks to marry Hanz≈ç Hattori in order to bear his child for the sake of her family. Her one skill is the making of medicinal herbs because she suffers from constant stomach aches and sought to find a medicine that would cure them. She is rather inept as a ninja and widely considered a \\"ninja failure,\\" though she steadily improves over time and eventually becomes a competent ninja. She's in love with Shim-no-Hanz≈ç. Usagi is very kind-hearted, such as when she tries to get Kami no Hanz≈ç and Princess Sara together because she hopes it would make Hanz≈ç happy, and innocent, having learned how babies are made when her friend Kame only after she instructs Usagi on how to seduce Ranmaru in order for them to escape his prison alive. She becomes a better ninja after an attack on Iga. In the end, she and Shimo-no-Hanzo have a family together with three girls and a son named Hanzo (including Mamezo)Tail of the Moon, vol. 10 Usagi is an orphan;Tail of the Moon, vol. 2 her father was apparently killed by a bear on the \\"Mountain of Death\\" and her mother died in childbirth along with the baby.Tail of the Moon, vol. 3 ;, or :A dedicated and talented young ninja who is head of the Hattori clan of Segachi. He is also called to distinguish him from the two other people named \\"Hanz≈ç Hattori\\" (including the historical Hanz≈ç Hattori). Since Hanz≈ç was eleven, he held the difficult position of leading the weakening Hattori clan.Tail of the Moon, vol. 2; \\"[He has] led the weakening Hattori clan since he was 11 years old.\\" He at first he opposed getting married because of his love for Sara but as he spends more time with Usagi he helps her do better in ninjutsu and falls in love with her. In the end, he and Usagi have a family together with three girls and a son named Hanzo (including Mamezo). ;Mamezo :Usagi's constant companion and foster child. He is a young boy who looks to be between six to eight years old, although he seems somewhat more skilled in everyday tasks than Usagi, even helping her to get dressed. When Mamezo was a baby, he was found by Usagi's dog, Shiro, and it is believed by Hanz≈ç that Mamezo's fear of dogs stems from this incident.Tail of the Moon, vol. 5 Later on, it seems that Mamezo's deepest wish is to have Usagi as his mother and to have Hanz≈ç as his father. Eventually, Mamezo encounters his real parents who reject him, as his father tries to force him to forget his past and his mother states that she cannot love him as much as she loves his baby brother, thus making Mamezo permanently cut ties with them. Mamezo's grandfather entrusts him to Usagi's care after knowing that Mamezo can never become a court noble. Mamezo later becomes engaged to his childhood friend, Watari and becomes a skillful shinobi ninja. ; :Usagi's rival. Yuri is more talented than Usagi at ninjutsu, but seems to be threatened by the way Usagi's good-natured and straightforward behavior seems to affect Hanz≈ç. Shortly after she arrives, she attempts to poison Usagi but fails due to Usagi's immunity. Later, she develops a girlish crush (which later develops to full-on romantic feelings) on Goemon, mentioning to Usagi how \\"lucky\\" she is to have Goemon so devoted to her. She claimed to have been qualified as a ninja at the age of seven, though Hanz≈ç finds out that it had actually been Yuri's twin sister, Yuna, who achieved the feat. Yuri's desperation and ruthless determination to become a ninja had been to escape the shadow of her sister. She sees her grandfather and friend die during the attack on Iga, becomes a qualified ninja, and forms a relationship with Goemon.Tail of the Moon, vol. 13 ;, or :A relative of Shimo-no-Hanz≈ç Hattori, this Hanzou is the historical(Hattori Hanz≈ç) and is from the Hattori clan of Okazaki in Upper Iga, hence his being referred to as Kami-no-Hanz≈ç (‰∏ä„ÅÆÂçäËîµ \\"Upper-(Iga)-Hanz≈ç\\") to distinguish him from the other ninja also named \\"Hanz≈ç Hattori\\" (including his father Yasunaga). While he is a notorious playboy, he is in a relationship with Sara, the daughter of Oda Nobunaga. Their relationship is one that his father reservedly accepts, not only because (as the manservant of Tokugawa Ieyasu) the Hattori clan is current warring against her father, but also her father's aim to obliterate all ninja in Japan. He is devoted to and protective of Sara, refusing to allow her to go on an assignment because she is pregnant with their child.Tail of the Moon, vol. 7 They eventually have a daughter named Kaguya.Tail of the Moon, vol. 12 Hanz≈ç compares him to Hikaru Genji from The Tale of Genji. ;Princess Sara :The daughter of the feudal warlord Oda Nobunaga, Princess Sara is a talented ninja but is considered an enemy by many ninja clans due to her father's actions and assassins are regularly sent after her. She is attended by a loyal retainer, Rikimaru, who is also a ninja. It is revealed that Sara climbs three mountains every day to stay fit. She once faked a marriage to Shimo-no-Hanz≈ç to save Iga from an attack by her father and remains an ally of the ninja of Iga. Though she despises Kami-no-Hanz≈ç's flirting, her love for him is so strong that she would rather die than live without him. She becomes pregnant with Kami-no- Hanz≈ç's child.Tail of the Moon, vol. 3, chapter 16 Her daughter Kaguya is eventually born after the attack on Iga and was delivered with Usagi's help. ; :He was once engaged to be married to Usagi, and grew up taking care of her in their ninja village. Goemon canceled the engagement because he so injured on an assignment that he felt he had no choice but to cancel it as he could no longer take of Usagi. However, he appears to still hold feelings for Usagi, and actively interferes with communications between Hanz≈ç and Usagi. He is one of the few ninjas who survived the attack on Iga because he was on an assignment that night. When he breaks the code of the ninja and starts stealing money, Usagi stops him. While he remains protective of Usagi and greatly wishes for her happiness, he eventually marries Yuri. ; :Another feudal lord, Ieyasu's son and wife were killed by Princess Sara in the manga (although that is not historically true). Usagi first met him in the woods when gathering herbs to tend to a wounded soldier. Later, he stitched up Usagi's forehead when she ran into a wall and he hired her as a herbalist to assist his current herbalist, Yukimaru. After much begging on Usagi's part, he allows Sara and Kami-no-Hanz≈ç to be together. Kami-no-Hanz≈ç's father works for him and this is the reason that he will not allow Kami-no-Hanz≈ç and Sara to be together. Usagi also inspires him to gain control of Japan in order to establish peace and prosperity. He lets Usagi work and lives with him. ; :Ieyasu Tokugawa's chief herbalist, a beautiful young man who has studied western medicine. Originally Usagi believed him to be a woman, due to his good looks, while Yukimaru believed Usagi to be a boy. Yukimaru has a fear of women, and Usagi makes him uncomfortable, though he falls in love with her. ;Ranmaru Mori :The most loyal follower underneath Oda Nobunaga. He is in charge of hunting down Iga ninja, but somehow falls deeply in love with Usagi. He even tries to have his way with her and goes so far as to say that as he was having sex with her best friend, Kame, while imagining it was with her. After the attack on Iga, he sets out to look for Usagi, but finds the dead and burned Kame, and later kidnaps Usagi. He is a bitter rival of Mitsuhide, who was granted the Sakamoto Castle, which had been previously held by Ranmaru's family. He dies protecting Usagi. ;Kame :Usagi's best friend since childhood, they are like sisters to one another. She is a beautiful and outstanding ninja, but had once been picked on for being a slow learner and Usagi would have to save her. She graduated second-to-last, in front of only Usagi, as she would constantly give into Usagi's demands to play. When she discovers that Usagi is Hanzo's bride-elect, Kame is relieved that someone will care for Usagi when she cannot. While she loves Goemon, Kame becomes Ranmaru's lover in order to learn about the plans for the attack on Iga; she has no compunction whatsoever to seduce any man and kill him to protect her home and Usagi. Kame dies saving Usagi during the attack on Iga. ;Mitsuhide Akechi :A loyal retainer of Nobunaga and the holder of Sakamoto Castle, Mitsuhide is thoughtful man with moderate political views and an open mind. He is a devoted husband and father to his wife, Hiroko, and their daughter, Tama. He suffers from failing eyesight. When Usagi makes medicine to improve his vision, Mitsuhide realizes that not all ninja are bad. He secretly helps the Iga ninja, though is eventually discovered by Ranmaru. Mitsuhide is forced to lead the eventual attack on Iga and Ranmaru's machinations force Mitsuhide out of Nobunaga's favour, Mitsuhide leads a rebellion against Nobunaga as revenge for Hiroko, who committed suicide in hopes it would atone for Mitsuhide's perceived slight on Nobunaga. Though Mitsuhide is believed to have died in the attack after being captured by Toyotomi Hideyoshi's forces, he continues to secretly live as a monk named Tenkai with Ieyasu. ;Oda Nobunaga :A powerful warlord conquering clans in Japan and on the verge of unifying the entire nation, Nobunaga is temperamental and despises all ninja, but is also known for recognizing a person for their abilities rather than their social status. He is the father of Princess Sara, as well as Sara's older sister Toku and her brother Nobukatsu. His constant shifting moods make him unpredictable, forcing many lords like Mitsuhide and Ieyasu to act extremely carefully around him. Usagi's talents eventually reach him and he forces her to remain as his herbalist, which she agrees to for the sake of finding Hanz≈ç and dissuading him from taking revenge for the destruction of Iga. During Mitsuhide's revolt, Hanz≈ç pretends to kill Nobunaga to appease Mitsuhide's desire for revenge, but really doesn't, and Nobunaga walks into the flames Mitsuhide had created and is found dead after the fires burn out.

He was the second son of Henryk IX Starszy, Duke of G≈Çog√≥w by his wife Hedwig, daughter of Duke Konrad III the Old duke of Ole≈õnica. Life The death of his older brother Sigismund on 24 December 1458 made him the sole heir of his father (another brother, whose name is unknown, died young). In 1462, Henry XI participated in the meeting between King Casimir IV of Poland and King George of Bohemia. With his father, he was excommunicated by the Pope Pius II for not to support the eventual inheritance of Casimir IV's son over the Bohemia throne. After Henry IX's death in 1467, his son assumed the government over G≈Çog√≥w. Henry XI was very indolent and sickly person since his childhood. He settled his main residence in Ko≈ºuch√≥w, which was the capital of his Duchy. After assumed the government, he didn't show greater political ambitions, because he lived all his adult life under the shadow of his father. Following the advises of the City Council of Wroc≈Çaw he send a message to Krak√≥w, where he encouraged King Casimir IV or one of his sons to take the throne of Bohemia. In 1468, Henry XI decided to support King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and participated in his unsuccessful trip to Silesia and Lusatia against King George of Bohemia. Since the beginning of his reign, Henry XI continued his father's politics, for example, when he successfully supported his cousin Balthasar in his attempt to recover the Duchy of ≈ªaga≈Ñ after being deposed by his brother Jan II the Mad in 1468. One year later, during King Matthias's coronation as King of Bohemia at Olomouc, he received the formal restoration of the lands belonged to the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w who were annexed by the Kingdom of Bohemia since 1360 (including the other half of G≈Çog√≥w), but he only could take formal possession after the death of Margareta of Celje (widow of Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw, from the Cieszyn branch), who held the cities as her . Henryk XI remained unmarried for a long time. At the end of his life, and under the pressures of his advisers, who acting on behalf of the Elector Albert III Achilles of Brandenburg, was arranged his marriage with one of the Elector's daughter, the twelve-years-old Barbara. In the marriage contract was stipulated that, in case of the Duke's death without issue, all his lands were passed to his wife, with reversion to her family. The wedding took place in Berlin on 11 October 1472. Henry XI died suddenly on 22 February 1476, probably poisoned by Brandenburg agents. He was buried in the Church of the Mother's Day in Ko≈ºuch√≥w. After his death, broke a long succession war for the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w. The next legitimate male heir of Henry XI was his cousin Jan II the Mad, former Duke of ≈ªaga≈Ñ, who had to face the pretensions of the Elector of Brandenburg, Matthias Corvinus and the King of Poland. Only in 1482 was finally made an arrangement in Kamieniec ZƒÖbkowicki, under which the towns of Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie, Sulech√≥w, Lubsko, Bobrowice passed to Brandenburg. Henryk XI is negatively evaluated by both Polish and German historians. They accused him of incompetence and weakness. Also, he was a true prince of his time: he enjoyed eat, sleep and drink.

History It was originally one of the major tin-mining towns in Malaysia around early 1900'. Tanjung Tualang obtained its name from a type of tree called Tualang and later a major tin mining company its namesake Toh Allang Chinese Tin Ltd. In 1939 Tanjung Tualang became a major host for the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM). A well known CPM Malay leader, Rashid Maidin, was recruited here by Tu Lung Shan. Government The mukim is under the administration of Batu Gajah District Council. Economy A number of multinational amalgamated and tin mining companies operated and controlled the mining area in Tanjung Tualang in the mid 1900s such as ‚Äì Lower Perak Tin Dredging ‚Äì Southern Kinta Consolidated ‚Äì Southern Malayan Tin Dredging ‚Äì Austral Amalgamated Tin ‚Äì Osborne & Chapple ‚Äì Pernas Chartered Management ‚Äì Malaysian Mining Corporation. In 1970 there were around 5 (type 1) very large tin dredging machines (Kapal Korek in Malay). The type 1s are among the biggest tin dredgers in the world. There were also many smaller type of dredgers scattered in Tanjung Tualang. The dredgers were usually owned by European companies whilst local mining companies would opt to use a \\"Palong\\" type of mining technology. Today these old mining areas have either been converted to freshwater ponds (Lombong in Malay) breeding freshwater prawn/fish or turned into palm oil estates. Tanjung Tualang also has a large number of rubber estates (owned individually or by local and multinational corporations). It is believed that Tanjung Tualang has an \\"Underground Armament Testing Complex\\" for the Malaysian Government under the purview of the Ministry Of Defense. The actual site for this facility is undisclosed but available clues suggest a nearby area known as Changkat Tin. Access to this area is restricted. Tanjung Tualang is also known for its freshwater prawns hence giving Tanjung Tualang its nickname (Freshwater Prawn Town). Together with nearby Sungai Durian the famous freshwater prawns (in Malay - Udang Galah) of Tanjung Tualang are much sought after by prawn lovers.

For more than 15,000 years, springs broke through the desert floor, creating grassy meadows (called las vegas by Mexican explorers). The bubbling springs were a source of water for Native Americans living here at least 5,000 years ago. Known as The Birthplace of Las Vegas it sustained travelers of the Old Spanish Trail and Mormons who came to settle the West. The springs' source is the Las Vegas aquifer. The springs are now a part of the Las Vegas Springs Preserve. Las Vegas Springs was once the site of three springs, running into two large pools of water. It is a site historically known for a gathering of pioneers and Native Americans and early settlers in the Las Vegas Valley. In 1905, it provided water source to the budding town and railroad. Once pipe lines were laid and wells were drilled, the water table dropped, and the springs stopped flowing to the surface in 1962. The site is currently undergoing rehabilitation to protect what remains architecturally and archaeologically.City of Las Vegas, Historic Locations > Big Springs/Las Vegas Springs Now, it is 180 acres of historic land located just west of Downtown Las Vegas.

Retrieved in April 25, 2012, to 12:10 pm. Later, American traveler John C. Fremont and Kit Carson camped at the springs in 1844. The springs stopped flowing to the surface in 1962 as the water table dropped as more water was pumped out to meet the demands of a growing population than was being replaced by rainfall and snow melt. Uncontrolled use of private wells and wasted water contributed to the early depletion of the aquifer. This forced the Las Vegas Land and Water Company to drill 'Well No. 1' in 1923 to supply the demands for water. The springs and associated infrastructure have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978 and are marked as Nevada Historical Marker 40.

Saadi is on the right. The Golestan (, also transliterated as Gulist√¢n and Gulistan \\"The Flower Garden\\") is a landmark of Persian literature, perhaps its single most influential work of prose. Written in 1258 CE, it is one of two major works of the Persian poet Sa'di, considered one of the greatest medieval Persian poets. It is also one of his most popular books, and has proved deeply influential in the West as well as the East.http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/virtualtour/gulistan.htm The Golestan is a collection of poems and stories, just as a flower-garden is a collection of flowers. It is widely quoted as a source of wisdom. The well- known aphorism still frequently repeated in the western world, about being sad because one has no shoes until one meets the man who has no feet \\"whereupon I thanked Providence for its bounty to myself\\" is from the Golestan.[Durant, The Age of Faith, 326] The minimalist plots of the Golestan's stories are expressed with precise language and psychological insight, creating a \\"poetry of ideas\\" with the concision of mathematical formulas. The book explores virtually every major issue faced by humankind, with both an optimistic and a subtly satirical tone. There is much advice for rulers, in this way coming within the mirror for princes genre. But as Eastwick comments in his introduction to the work,https://archive.org/stream/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog_djvu.txt there is a common saying in Persian, \\"Each word of Sa'di has seventy-two meanings\\", and the stories, alongside their entertainment value and practical and moral dimension, frequently focus on the conduct of dervishes and are said to contain Sufi teachings. Idries Shah elaborates further. \\"The place won by the Golestan as a book of moral uplift invariably given to the literate young has had the effect of establishing a basic Sufic potential in the minds of its readers.\\" Reasons for composition The poet Sa'di converses by night with a young friend in a garden. Miniature from Golestan. Herat, 1427. Chester Beatty Library, Dublin; workshops of Baysunghur. In his introduction Sa'di describes how a friend persuaded him to go out to a garden on 21 April 1258. There the friend gathered up flowers to take back to town. Sa'di remarked on how quickly the flowers would die, and proposed a flower garden that would last much longer: :::Of what use will be a dish of flowers to thee? :::Take a leaf from my flower-garden. :::A flower endures but five or six days :::But this flower- garden is always delightful. There follow the words illustrated in the Persian miniature, believed to be by the Mughal painter Govardhan, shown at the top of the article:The original painting (12.9 x 6.7 cm) is dated c. 1630‚Äì45, and is kept in the Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC. For an account of the possible erotic subtext of the picture, see Francesca Leoni, Mika Natif (eds.) (2013). Eros and Sexuality in Islamic Art, pp. 43‚Äì52. : : :\\"When I said this, he poured out the skirt of flowers and hung on my skirt, saying 'The generous man, if he promises, keeps his word!' \\" Sa'di continues, \\"On the same day I happened to write two chapters, namely on polite society and the rules of conversation, in a style acceptable to orators and instructive to letter-writers.\\".http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/gulistan.txt In finishing the book, Sa'di writes that, though his speech is entertaining and amusing, \\"it is not hidden from the enlightened minds of sahibdils (possessors of heart), who are primarily addressed here, that pearls of healing counsel have been drawn onto strings of expression, and the bitter medicine of advice has been mixed with the honey of wit\\". Structure The opening page from the introduction After the introduction, the Golestan is divided into eight chapters, each consisting of a number of stories, decorated with short poems:Chapter titles given in the 1899 translation by Sir Edwin Arnold, http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/gulistan.txt https://archive.org/details/TheGulistanOrRoseGardenOfSadi-EdwardRehatsek :1. The Manners of Kings :2. On the Morals of Dervishes :3. On the Excellence of Contentment :4. On the Advantages of Silence :5. On Love and Youth :6. On Weakness and Old Age :7. On the Effects of Education :8. On Rules for Conduct in Life Altogether the work contains some 595 short poems in Persian, consisting on average of just under two couplets each, in a variety of metres;Thiesen, Finn (1982). A Manual of Classical Persian Prosody, with chapters on Urdu, Karakhanidic and Ottoman prosody. Wiesbaden; pp. 261‚Äì262. there are also occasional verses in Arabic. Some stories are very brief. The short poems which decorate the stories sometimes represent the words of the protagonists, sometimes the author's perspective and sometimes, as in the following case, are not clearly attributed: Chapter 1, story 34 One of the sons of Harunu'r-rashid came to his father in a passion, saying, \\"Such an officer's son has insulted me, by speaking abusively of my mother.\\" Harun said to his nobles, \\"What should be the punishment of such a person?\\" One gave his voice for death, and another for the excision of his tongue, and another for the confiscation of his goods and banishment. Harun said, \\"O my son! the generous part would be to pardon him, and if thou canst not, then do thou abuse his mother, but not so as to exceed the just limits of retaliation, for in that case we should become the aggressors.\\" :::They that with raging elephants make war :::Are not, so deem the wise, the truly brave; :::But in real verity, the valiant are :::Those who, when angered, are not passion's slave. :::An ill-bred fellow once a man reviled, :::Who patient bore it, and replied, \\"Good friend! :::Worse am I than by thee I could be styled, :::And better know how often I offend.\\"The king referred to is Harun al-Rashid. Since there is little biographical information about Sa'di outside of his writings, his short, apparently autobiographical tales, such as the following have been used by commentators to build up an account of his life. Chapter 2, story 7 I remember that, in the time of my childhood, I was devout, and in the habit of keeping vigils, and eager to practise mortification and austerities. One night I sate up in attendance on my father, and did not close my eyes the whole night, and held the precious qur'an in my lap while the people around me slept. I said to my father, \\"Not one of these lifts up his head to perform a prayer. They are so profoundly asleep that you would say they were dead.\\" He replied, \\"Life of thy father! it were better if thou, too, wert asleep; rather than thou shouldst be backbiting people.\\" :::Naught but themselves can vain pretenders mark, :::For conceit's curtain intercepts their view. :::Did God illume that which in them is dark, :::Naught than themselves would wear a darker hue. The young athlete is marooned on a pillar. Chester Beatty Library, Dublin. Most of the tales within the Golestan are longer, some running on for a number of pages. In one of the longest, in Chapter 3, Sa'di explores aspects of undertaking a journey for which one is ill-equipped: Chapter 3, story 28 An athlete, down on his luck at home, tells his father how he believes he should set off on his travels, quoting the words: :::As long as thou walkest about the shop or the house :::Thou wilt never become a man, O raw fellow. :::Go and travel in the world :::Before that day when thou goest from the world. His father warns him that his physical strength alone will not be sufficient to ensure the success of his travels, describing five kinds of men who can profit from travel: the rich merchant, the eloquent scholar, the beautiful person, the sweet singer and the artisan. The son nevertheless sets off and, arriving penniless at a broad river, tries to get a crossing on a ferry by using physical force. He gets aboard, but is left stranded on a pillar in the middle of the river. This is the first of a series of misfortunes that he is subjected to, and it is only the charity of a wealthy man that finally delivers him, allowing him to return home safe, though not much humbled by his tribulations. The story ends with the father warning him that if he tries it again he may not escape so luckily: :::The hunter does not catch every time a jackal. :::It may happen that some day a tiger devours him. Chapter 5, story 5 In the fifth chapter of The Golestan of Saadi, on Love and Youth, Saadi includes explicit moral and sociological points about the real life of people from his time period (1203-1291). The story below by Saadi, like so much of his work, conveys meaning on many levels and broadly on many topics. In this story, Saadi communicates the importance of teachers educating the ‚Äúwhole child‚Äù‚Äîcognitively, morally, emotionally, socially, and ethically‚Äìusing, as often in the book, homoerotic attraction as a motif. Even though adults and teachers have been accorded great status and respect in Iranian culture and history, in Saadi‚Äôs story, he shows that a young boy has great wisdom in understanding his educational needs. :::A schoolboy was so perfectly beautiful and sweet-voiced that the teacher, in accordance with human nature, conceived such an affection towards him that he often recited the following verses: :::::I am not so little occupied with you, O heavenly face, :::::That remembrance of myself occurs to my mind. :::::From your sight I am unable to withdraw my eyes :::::Although when I am opposite I may see that an arrow comes. :::Once the boy said to him: \\"As you strive to direct my studies, direct also my behavior. If you perceive anything reprovable in my conduct, although it may seem approvable to me, inform me thereof that I may endeavor to change it.\\" He replied: \\"O boy, make that request to someone else because the eyes with which I look upon you behold nothing but virtues.\\" :::::The ill-wishing eye, be it torn out :::::Sees only defects in his virtue. :::::But if you possess one virtue and seventy faults :::::A friend sees nothing except that virtue.https://archive.org/details/TheGulistanOrRoseGardenOfSadi- EdwardRehatsek Influence Sa'di's Golestan is said to be one of the most widely read books ever produced. From the time of its composition to the present day it has been admired for its \\"inimitable simplicity\\", seen as the essence of simple elegant Persian prose. Persian for a long time was the language of literature from Bengal to Constantinople, and the Golestan was known and studied in much of Asia. In Persian-speaking countries today, proverbs and aphorisms from the Golestan appear in every kind of literature and continue to be current in conversation, much as Shakespeare is in English.Ibex Publishers' description of Gulistan, http://ibexpub.com/index.php?main_page=pubs_product_book_info&products;_id=105 As Sir John Malcolm wrote in his Sketches of Persia in 1828, the stories and maxims of Sa'di were \\"known to all, from the king to the peasant\\". In Europe The Golestan has been significant in the influence of Persian literature on Western culture. La Fontaine based his \\"Le songe d'un habitant du Mogol\\"http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Songe_d%E2%80%99un_Habitant_du_Mogol on a story from Golestan chapter 2 story 16: A certain pious man in a dream beheld a king in paradise and a devotee in hell. He inquired, \\"What is the reason of the exaltation of the one, and the cause of the degradation of the other? for I had imagined just the reverse.\\" They said, \\"That king is now in paradise owing to his friendship for darweshes, and this recluse is in hell through frequenting the presence of kings.\\" :::Of what avail is frock, or rosary, :::Or clouted garment? Keep thyself but free :::From evil deeds, it will not need for thee :::To wear the cap of felt: a darwesh be :::In heart, and wear the cap of Tartary. Voltaire was familiar with works of Sa'di, and wrote the preface of Zadig in his name. He mentions a French translation of the Golestan, and himself translated a score of verses, either from the original or from some Latin or Dutch translation. Sir William Jones advised students of Persian to pick an easy chapter of the Golestan to translate as their first exercise in the language. Thus, selections of the book became the primer for officials of British India at Fort William College and at Haileybury College in England. In the United States Ralph Waldo Emerson who addressed a poem of his own to Sa'di, provided the preface for Gladwin's translation, writing, \\"Saadi exhibits perpetual variety of situation and incident ... he finds room on his narrow canvas for the extremes of lot, the play of motives, the rule of destiny, the lessons of morals, and the portraits of great men. He has furnished the originals of a multitude of tales and proverbs which are current in our mouths, and attributed by us to recent writers.\\" Henry David Thoreau quoted from the book in A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers and in his remarks on philanthropy in Walden. Translations Frontispiece of Andr√© du Ryer's translation Sa ødi was first introduced to the West in a partial French translation by Andr√© du Ryer (1634). Friedrich Ochsenbach based a German translation (1636) on this. Georgius Gentius produced a Latin version accompanied by the Persian text in 1651.Iranian Studies in the Netherlands, J. T. P. de Bruijn, Iranian Studies, Vol. 20, No. 2/4, Iranian Studies in Europe and Japan (1987), 169. Adam Olearius made the first direct German translation. The Golestan has been translated into many languages. It has been translated into English a number of times: Stephen Sullivan (London, 1774, selections), James Dumoulin (Calcutta, 1807), Francis Gladwin (Calcutta, 1808, preface by Ralph Waldo Emerson),http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015012849298 James Ross (London, 1823),http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/sadi-gulistan2.html S.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning SS Theodore Roosevelt was a passenger steamer built in 1906 at Toledo, Ohio, by the Toledo Shipbuilding Company, and operated commercially on Lake Michigan. Ordered taken over by the U.S. Navy on 6 April 1918 for World War I service as a troop transport, she was acquired by the United States Navy from the Roosevelt Steamship Company sometime in the spring of 1918, assigned Identification Number (Id. No.) 1478, and fitted out as a troop transport during the summer and fall of 1918. Though some sources suggest that Theodore Roosevelt served in a non-commissioned capacity in the Navy, the fact that the 1919 Navy Directory lists Lieutenant Harry D. Irwin, USNRF, as \\"...comdg U.S.S. Roosevelt...\\" is a strong indication that she was in fact commissioned as USS Theodore Roosevelt (ID-1478) during 1918. Operations By 1 November 1918, Theodore Roosevelt was assigned to duty as a transport carrying troops back and forth across the English Channel between the United Kingdom and France. She continued that duty at least until 1 April 1919 and probably returned to the United States sometime in April or May. Decommissioning and disposal As of 1 June 1919, Theodore Roosevelt was at New York awaiting disposition. On 1 July 1919, she was sold to the Cleveland Steamship Company and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Later career A color postcard depicting the Theodore Roosevelt in scheduled service on Lake Michigan Once again SS Theodore Roosevelt, she resumed her commercial career as a passenger ship on the Great Lakes, operating on Lake Erie. In 1926, she was sold to the Maritime Securities Company of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and underwent modifications. In 1927, she was sold to the Chicago Roosevelt Steamship Company of Duluth, Minnesota. As a result of either the 1926 or 1927 sale, she moved back to Lake Michigan. Later in her career she also operated in the Detroit, Michigan, area, and perhaps elsewhere in the Great Lakes. She was sold again to T.J. McGuire of Duluth,Unfortunately, the reference to this sale at NavSource Online (at http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/171478.htm) states its year as \\"1925\\", a clear typographical error which cannot be corrected from its context or by any other source. Theodore Roosevelt appears to have been laid up sometime around 1945. She was sold in 1946 to the Cleveland and Cedar Point Steamship Company of Duluth, then again in 1947 to the Cleveland and Buffalo Steamship Company of Cleveland. She finally was sold for scrapping in 1950 to the Cream City Lumber and Wrecking Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

There is no broad agreement on which definition to use. Second-generation consequently may be either the children or the grandchildren of such an immigrant. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary \\"first- generation\\" means # \\"born in the U.S. -used of an American of immigrant parentage\\" # \\"foreign-born -used of a naturalized citizen According to the U.S Census Bureau, first generation refers to those who are foreign born, second generation refers to those with at least one foreign-born parent, and third- and-higher generation includes those with two U.S. native parents.  First generation  The term first-generation, as it pertains to a person's nationality or residency in a country, has two incompatible meanings: *A native-born citizen or resident of a country whose parents are foreign born, or a foreign-born citizen whose parents immigrated when that person was very young. *A foreign born citizen or resident who has immigrated to a new country of residence, that is, the first generation to immigrate.\\" This ambiguity is captured and corroborated in the Oxford English Dictionary's definition of \\"generation\\": :...designating a member of the first (or second, etc.) generation of a family to do something or live somewhere; spec. designating a naturalized immigrant or a descendant of immigrant parents, esp. in the United States.... (OED definition of \\"generation,\\" section 6b., the term \\"first generation\\" is used to refer to foreign-born residents (excluding those born abroad of American parents). There is no universal consensus on which of these meanings is always intended.  1.5 generation  The term 1.5 generation or 1.5G refers to individuals who immigrate to a new country before or during their early teens. They earn the label the \\"1.5 generation\\" because they bring with them or maintain characteristics from their home country, meanwhile engaging in assimilation and socialization with their new country. Oftentimes, in the case of small children, a battle of linguistic comprehension occurs between their academic language and the language spoken at home.Asher, C. (2011). \\"The progressive past: How history can help us serve generation 1.5\\". Reference & User Service Quarterly, 51(1). 43‚Äì48. Their identity is, thus, a combination of new and old culture and tradition. Sociologist Ruben Rumbaut was among the first to use the term to examine outcomes among those arriving in the United States before adolescence, but since then the term has expanded to include foreign students, as well as other unique individuals. Depending on the age of immigration, the community where they settle, extent of education in their native country, and other factors, 1.5 generation individuals identify with their countries of origin to varying degrees. However, their identification is affected by their experiences growing up in the new country. 1.5G individuals are often bilingual and find it easier to assimilate into local culture and society than people who immigrate as adults. Many 1.5 generation individuals also become bi-cultural, combining both cultures - culture from the country of origin with the culture of the new country.  Second generation  The term \\"second-generation\\" extends the concept of first-generation by one generation. As such, the term exhibits the same type of ambiguity as \\"first-generation,\\" as well as additional ones. Like \\"first- generation immigrant,\\" the term \\"second-generation\\" can refer to a member of either: *The second generation of a family to inhabit, but the first natively born in, a country, or *The second generation born in a country In the United States, among demographers and other social scientists, \\"second generation\\" refers to the U.S.-born children of foreign-born parents. The term second- generation immigrant attracts criticism due to it being an oxymoron. Namely, critics say, a \\"second-generation immigrant\\" is not an immigrant, since being \\"second-generation\\" means that the person is born in the country and the person's parents are the immigrants in question. Generation labeling immigrants is further complicated by the fact that immigrant generations may not correspond to the genealogical generations of a family. For instance, if a family of two parents and their two adult children immigrate to a new country, members in both generations of this family may be considered \\"first generation\\" by the former definition, as both parents and children were foreign-born, adult, immigrants. Likewise, if the two parents had a third child later on, this child would be of a different immigrant generation from that of its siblings. For every generation, the factor of mixed-generation marriages further convolutes the issue, as a person may have immigrants at several different levels of his or her ancestry. These ambiguities notwithstanding, generation labeling is frequently used in parlance, news articles , and reference articles without deliberate clarification of birthplace or naturalization. It may or may not be possible to determine, from context, which meaning is intended.  2.5 generation  When demographers and other social scientists in the United States use the term \\"second generation,\\" they usually refer to people with one foreign-born parent. Likewise, Statistics Canada defines second generation persons as those individuals who were born in Canada and had at least one parent born outside Canada. Some researchers have begun to question whether those with one native-born parent and those with no native-born parents should be lumped together, with evidence suggesting that there are significant differences in identities and various outcomes between the two groups. For instance, patterns of ethnic identification with the majority ethnic group and the heritage ethnic group differ between the 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 generations, such that there is greater polarization between the two identities in the 1.0 generation (i.e., identifying as Canadian implies dis-identifying as a member of the heritage ethnic community and vice versa ), a lack of a relation between the two identities in the 2.0 generation, and a positive association between the two identities for the 2.5 generation (i.e., implying that the two identities are compatible and possibly hybridized)  1.75 and 1.25 generations  Rub√©n G. Rumbaut has coined the terminology \\"1.75 generation\\" and \\"1.25 generation\\" immigrants, for children who are closer to birth or full adulthood when they immigrate.Rumbaut, Rub√©n. Ages, Life Stages, and Generational Cohorts: Decomposing the Immigrant First and Second Generations in the United States. p. 1167‚Äô‚Äô https://ssrn.com/abstract=1887924 Retrieved December 9, 2014. Children who arrive in their early childhood (ages 0 to 5) are referred to as 1.75 generation immigrants since their experiences are closer to a true 2nd- generation immigrant who was born in the country they live in: they retain virtually no memory of their country of birth, were too young to go to school to learn to read or write in the parental language or dialect in the home country, typically learn the language or dialect of the country they immigrate to without an accent and are almost entirely socialized there. Children who arrive in their adolescent years (ages 13‚Äì17) are referred to as 1.25 generation immigrants because their experiences are closer to the first generation of immigrants adults than to the native born second generation.  Factors leading to immigrant generations' accomplishments  Most immigrant youth tend to have higher academic accomplishment at all levels, at times even having greater levels of post-secondary education than their parents and grandparents. In order to explain this phenomenon, there are several factors that are noticeable: # Immigrant children usually have more in the way of family obligation than children not born of immigrants, so they are more likely feel pressure to study seriously at school and gain the ability to provide for their relatives. This can also be explained by a stronger emphasis of higher education from their immigrant parents who may invest in tutoring and private schooling to increase the human capital of their children.Warman, C., Webb, M. D., & Worswick, C. (2019). Immigrant category of admission and the earnings of adults and children: How far does the apple fall? Journal of Population Economics, 32(1), 53-112. doi:http://dx.doi.org.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/10.1007/s00148-018-0700-5 # Optimism‚Äîthe idea that if they put in the work that they'll achieve social mobility in the host nation‚Äîis also an important factor that motivates immigrant generations to work hard and succeed. # Most immigrant generations learn their mother tongue alongside the local national language(s) of their host country. As bilinguals, they have \\"advantages on all tasks especially involving conflicting attention\\". Many of these factors are reinforced and supported by the parents of immigrant youth who may have only immigrated in the first place in order to provide their children with a brighter future.

This increase can cause the drag coefficient to rise to more than ten times its low-speed value. The value of the drag-divergence Mach number is typically greater than 0.6; therefore it is a transonic effect. The drag-divergence Mach number is usually close to, and always greater than, the critical Mach number. Generally, the drag coefficient peaks at Mach 1.0 and begins to decrease again after the transition into the supersonic regime above approximately Mach 1.2. The large increase in drag is caused by the formation of a shock wave on the upper surface of the airfoil, which can induce flow separation and adverse pressure gradients on the aft portion of the wing. This effect requires that aircraft intended to fly at supersonic speeds have a large amount of thrust. In early development of transonic and supersonic aircraft, a steep dive was often used to provide extra acceleration through the high-drag region around Mach 1.0. This steep increase in drag gave rise to the popular false notion of an unbreakable sound barrier, because it seemed that no aircraft technology in the foreseeable future would have enough propulsive force or control authority to overcome it. Indeed, one of the popular analytical methods for calculating drag at high speeds, the Prandtl‚ÄìGlauert rule, predicts an infinite amount of drag at Mach 1.0. Two of the important technological advancements that arose out of attempts to conquer the sound barrier were the Whitcomb area rule and the supercritical airfoil. A supercritical airfoil is shaped specifically to make the drag-divergence Mach number as high as possible, allowing aircraft to fly with relatively lower drag at high subsonic and low transonic speeds. These, along with other advancements including computational fluid dynamics, have been able to reduce the factor of increase in drag to two or three for modern aircraft designs.

The school broke the Guinness world record for largest unbroken human chain, called the Bear Hug. The event was in support of Cancer research.Orleans Online  Local News  History  When St. Matthew Catholic High School opened in 1981, it was known as Eastern Area Junior High School, with Grades 6, 7 and 8. Not until June 1982 was the school officially named St. Matthew. The school opened with about 300 students. In its first year of existence, it was affectionately known by its first principal, Joseph Ryan, as \\"the far eastern school.\\" It was built by the firm Kearney and Coles with Edward Cuhaci as the architect, on property on Bilberry Drive in Orl√©ans, straddling two sides of Bilberry Creek. The school's first yearbook was entitled, perhaps appropriately, EMANON which is \\"NO NAME\\" spelled backwards. It did have an official name, but since it was the wordy \\"Eastern Area Elementary Junior High School,\\" it was, in a sense, nameless. This all changed at the official opening on 16 June 1982, when it was formally named \\"St. Matthew Catholic Junior High School.‚Äù The school underwent two expansions over the years to accommodate an ever-growing student population, which peaked at close to 1,800 students. In 1985, the first phase of a two-part expansion took place, adding a number of classrooms. This was followed by the second phase in 1987 that included more classrooms, specialty areas such as an automotive shop, music room, drama room and art room and a second gymnasium/cafeteria. The construction of St. Peter Catholic High School in 1992 provided spaces for some students previously at St. Matthew, relieving some of the enrollment pressures at the school. In 2009/2010, the school underwent another expansion, adding another wing.  Identity  The school crest, designed by teacher Joe Kelly, is a cross inside an oval, with four symbols, one in each quadrant formed by the cross. The four symbols are a quill representing writing, a book representing reading, a flame representing the spirit of sport and folded hands representing prayer. The name \\"St. Matthew\\" is on a banner at the bottom of the crest. The school mascot is a tiger. All St. Matthew sports teams are called Tigers, symbolizing speed and ferociousness.  Uniform policy  St. Matthew High School is one of the few in the city of Ottawa that have uniforms.http://mth.ocsb.ca/our-school  School layout  St. Matthew is a medium-sized, two-storey school. The school has two gymnasiums (one used as both a cafeteria and gym), a chapel, and a library. The school also has a satellite building beside the school that consists of 10 classrooms.  Bear Hug = Bear Hug 1  This event was documented in the 2005 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records. On 23 April 2004, St. Matthew Catholic High School made it into the Guinness Book of World Records with the world's largest bear hug, an endeavour led by school Principal Andr√© Potvin, and an achievement which resulted on 9 June 2004 being officially declared \\"St. Matthew High School Day\\" by Ottawa Mayor, Bob Chiarelli. The world's largest bear hug involved 5,117 students hugging for ten seconds. This world record was tied in with the school's fundraising for cancer, as students and staff, with the support of local businesses and residents, raised more than $108,000 in April of that year, surpassing the previous provincial record of $40,000 and setting a Canadian record for cancer fundraising by a high school.  Bear Hug 2  Bear Hug 2 in 2008 unsuccessfully attempted to break the Guinness Record (then held by the citizens of New Mexico at 6,553). Funds were again raised in support of cancer research.  Bear Hug 3  Bear Hug 3 in May 2010 raised over $500,000 for cancer patient care and research and set a new Guinness World Record of 10,554 participants, which was still standing in 2016.

He also served as club president from 1987 to 1993, and was at the forefront of the Save Our Skins campaign in 1990, which saved the club from financial ruin. In the 1967 Second Semi-final, Crowe was reported for allegedly striking ruckman John Nicholls, and suspended. He subsequently missed Richmond's drought-breaking premiership victory in the 1967 VFL Grand Final, and announced his retirement shortly afterward. Crowe's \\"phantom punch\\" is regarded as one of the most unlucky moments in VFL/AFL history. Crowe retired at the end of 2008 from working at the club, finally ending his involvement that had extended to over 50 years. In September 2012, it was reported that Crowe had been out riding his bicycle when he suddenly lost control and careered into the Yarra River. A passing jogger, John Greene, who happened to be a lifelong Tigers supporter, dived into the muddy river and pulled Crowe to safety with the help of other passers-by who formed a human chain to get him to the embankment.

He was the brother-in-law of General Hitoshi Imamura. Early Life and Education Tanabe was from Ishikawa prefecture, where his father was a former samurai of Kaga Domain and later a colonel in the early Imperial Japanese Army. After attending military preparatory schools in Matsuyama and Hiroshima, he graduated from the 22nd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1910 and from the 30th class of the Army Staff College in 1918. His classmates at the Army Staff College included Kanji Ishiwara and Korechika Anami. Military Career In his early career, Tanabe served on the staff of the Kyoto-based IJA 16th Division, as an instructor at the Army Academy, as a military attach√© to France, commander of the IJA 61th Infantry Battalion, and on the staff of the Army Maintenance Bureau. After serving as instructor at the Toyama Army Infantry School from 1933‚Äì1934, Tanabe served as Chief of the Economic Mobilization Section in the Army Ministry. He returned to the field to command the IJA 34th Infantry Regiment from 1936 to 1937, before his promotion to major general in August 1937 and returning to the Toyama Army Infantry School as its commandant.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II With the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Tanabe was appointed Chief of Staff of the IJA 10th Army in October 1937. This was a new organization under the Japanese Central China Area Army, created as an emergency reinforcement force to supplement the Japanese Shanghai Expeditionary Army after the Second Shanghai Incident. The Japanese 10th Army subsequently participated in the Battle of Nanjing and the subsequent atrocities known as the Nanking Massacre. The unit was officially disbanded in Nanjing on February 14, 1938. Tanabe was recalled to Japan to become commandant of the IJA Tank School, located in Chiba. Takane was promoted to lieutenant general in October 1939, and given command of the IJA 41st Division. This was also a new organization, raised in Yongsan District, Korea, and was assigned to 1st Army as a garrison force in Japanese- occupied Shanxi] Province. From March to November 1941, he was Chief of Staff of the Japanese Northern China Area Army. Tanabe was recalled to Japan at the end of 1941 to serve as Vice Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, and was in this position at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, which he had strenuously opposed. Once the war began, he favored a defensive strategy of luring the Allies into campaigns in areas away from their bases in hopes of stretching their supply lines to Japan's advantage. He was instrumental in helping put an end to the disastrous attrition of Japanese forces at Guadalcanal.Fuller, Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai As conditions began to deteriorate for Japan along its southern front in the Pacific War. Tanabe was dispatched to Japanese-occupied Sumatra in the Netherlands East Indies to take command of the IJA 25th Army under the Japanese Seventh Area Army at Fort de Kock, in April 1943. He remained at this post for the remainder of the war.Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia Tanabe had reservations about the increasing role of the Indonesian nationalist movement on Java, but responding to the ‚ÄúKoiso Promise‚Äù granting increased autonomy and eventual independence to Indonesia he established the Sumatra Central Advisory Committee and trained locals for administrative leadership roles. However, he attempted to distance himself from local politics by as much as possible., pages 608-609 At the end of the war, he was arrested by Dutch authorities and was sent to Medan where he faced a Dutch military tribunal which accused him of unspecified war crimes. He was sentenced to death on 30 December 1948 and executed on 10 July 1949.

Originally it was an all-white association and it now is the premier elite association in Bangladesh. Description Dhaka club has been described as \\"an oasis of calm in a frantic city, a colonial relic with several acres of lawns, tennis courts, reading rooms.\\"Malcolm Miles, Iain Borden and Tim Hall, The City Cultures Reader, page 77, Psychology Press, 2000, It has been noted that \\"the real old-school Dhaka wealth and political power calls this recreation club home. In times of ferment the city is ruled by Dhaka University; in times of peace the city is controlled by Dhaka Club.\\" The club is located near Shahbag Intersection. It is surrounded by Dhaka University, Bangladesh National Museum, Hotel Sheraton, BIRDEM Hospital, Ramna Park and the Suhrawardy Udyan. The club has facilities for meetings and seminars, as well as hall rooms, guest-rooms, kitchens and dining rooms, playing courts and rooms for table tennis, billiards, cards, squash, and lawn tennis, and a swimming pool. The wood-paneled club house is one of the few surviving British Raj era buildings in Dhaka. The Dhaka Club has three clay tennis courts and two squash courts.Bangladesh, post report, page 12, U.S. Dept. of State, 1985 In former times, indoor and outdoor games were dominant features of the club. At present, it gives considerable attention to cultural activities. History Pavilion of Ramna Racecourse in early 20th century, owned and managed together with Gymkhana Club The old club house in 1890 The origins of the club date back to 1825 when European residents in Old Dhaka established a Gentleman's club in Victoria Park (now known as Bahadur Shah Park) by that name.Muntasir Mamun, \\"‡¶¢‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ: ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶Æ‡ßÉ‡¶§‡¶ø ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶Æ‡ßÉ‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶∞ ‡¶®‡¶ó‡¶∞‡ßÄ\\" (Dhaka, Smriti Bismritir Nogori), 3rd Edition, 4th Printing, January 2004, Ananya Publishers, Dhaka, Page 104, ‡•§ It was established in place of an older club known as the Armenian Club or the Antagar (a corruption of Addagar or Gossip House). The last name rendered its name to the park which came to be known as Antagar Maidan (Antaghor Field).Sirajul Islam, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh: Humanities (Vol. 45, Issue 1), page 39, Asiatic Society of Bangladesh, 2000 After the club shifted elsewhere East India Company bought the land in 1862. In 1851 the club premise shifted to Ramna with help from local aristocrats along with Europeans. The land of Dhaka Club was leased out from the Dhaka Nawab Family from his Shahbag garden estate. After the partition of Bengal in 1905, dhaka was made the capital of the new province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. The British civilians, who came to govern the new province, felt the need of a social club. The club was fashioned after the model of the Bengal Club of Kolkata. It was registered on 19 August 1911 and was granted legal status on 14 September 1911 under the Indian Companies Act of 1882. The founding members were Lt. Col. EA Hall (Civil Surgeon, Dhaka), CR Bryan, HG Bally (Commandant, Military Police Battalion, Dhaka), JO Rennie (PWD, Dhaka), and JS Wilson and AT Halliday of Indian Police, Dhaka. \\"The British reunited Bengal in 1911 and compensated Dhaka with the Dhaka University and the Dhaka Club.\\"M. J. Akbar, Byline, page 111, Chronicle Books, 2003, The membership of the club grew quickly in the 1920s and '30s as many Europeans came to Dhaka in connection with the jute trade, steam navigation, the railway, and estate management. Many of the members were high-ranking British officers from Minto Road. Natives, including aristocrats of Dhaka Nawab Family, were banned, while Anglo-Indians had full access. In 1941, the Governor of Bengal leased out a tract of land comprising 524 bighas (173 acres) to the Dhaka Club. The club used the land to develop a racecourse (known as ramna racecourse, now converted into Ramna Garden), a golf course, the club buildings and playgrounds. The golf course is one of the oldest golf courses in South Asia, and was owned and managed by Dhaka Club and nearby Gymkhana Club together. Gymkhana Club, located at the opposing side of Shahbag gardens, also patronized the Racecourse together with Dhaka Club. During Bangladesh Liberation War the club was closed except for a few staff. On 26 March 1971 Pakistani army tried to enter the club but Madhuraj, the Nepali security guard, refused entry. He along with few other staff were executed by Pakistan army after they forcefully entered the club. After the Independence of Bangladesh, the club adapted more Bengali characteristics. In 1973 it changed the Letter head of the club to Bangla. In 1978 Geetiara Safya Chowdhury became the first female member of the club. In the 21st century the club arrived with only about 5 acres (20,000 m2) of land left in its control, as the rest has been overtaken by the government of Bangladesh by acquisition. Rules The club is run by an executive committee comprising a president and 10 members who are elected for a one-year term in a general meeting. The right to vote is limited to 1,500 permanent and life members as well as general members. who form a highly privileged company. That total figure of 1,500 is strictly protected, though any member can resign and nominate his successor. A past president was forced to resign because he ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù allowed this limit to be exceeded that number. Foreigners can become members for an annual fee.Mikey Leung and Belinda Meggitt (ed.), Bangladesh, page 147, Bradt Travel Guides, 2012, However, members are of different categories such as life members, general members, honorary members, special members, and officers of the defense forces. The total number of members of the club in 2016 was 3,120, a figure that is considered as the highest membership limit. The rules and regulations of the remain the same from the times of the Raj. No locals are permitted in the lounge, the bar, the dining room or the card room. The only concession that the Dhaka Club has made is to permit the loose kurta inside its premises. For men the dress rule is collared shirt and covered shoes.

The MPI KoFo has been at the forefront of research in chemistry since its formation. One of these is the development of the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process through the efforts of Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch in 1925 when the institute was still organized as the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung. Nobel Prize laureate Karl Ziegler also worked at the institute alongside Hans-Georg Gellert, one of his former students, to discover aufbau reaction (Aufbaureaktion) or growth reaction among aluminum alkyl compounds. Departments=Organic Synthesis Research in the Organic Synthesis Department, led by Tobias Ritter, focuses on the development of novel reaction chemistry. It seeks to discover molecular structure and reactivity that can contribute to interdisciplinary solutions for challenges in science. Homogeneous Catalysis The Homogeneous Catalysis Department, led by , focuses on the development of new catalysis concepts within the areas of organocatalysis, transition metal catalysis, and, to some extent, biocatalysis. Since 1999, the group concentrates on enantioselective organocatalysis as a fundamental approach complementing biocatalysis and transition metal catalysis. They have a profound interest in developing ‚Äúnew reactions‚Äù, designing and identifying new principles for the development of organocatalysts, expanding the scope of already developed catalysts such as proline, using organocatalysis in the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals, and also investigating the mechanism by which organocatalysts activate their substrates. Furthermore, in 2005 the department has first conceptualized another approach to asymmetric catalysis, namely Asymmetric Counteranion-Directed Catalysis (ACDC). This idea has not only progressed within the department but also at other institutions around the globe into a general strategy for asymmetric synthesis applied in organocatalysis as well as in transition metal catalysis and Lewis acid catalysis. Heterogeneous Catalysis The Heterogeneous Catalysis Department, led by Ferdi Sch√ºth, is concentrated on the synthesis and characterization of inorganic materials with an application focus in heterogeneous catalysis. Especially important are high surface area materials with controlled porosity and nanostructured catalysts. Reactions studied include model reactions, such as carbon monoxide oxidation, and energy relevant conversions, i.e. methane activation, biomass conversion, ammonia decomposition and catalyzed hydrogen storage. This research is supported by studies into the fundamental processes governing solids formation. Organometallic Chemistry The Organometallic Chemistry Department, led by Alois F√ºrstner, is focused on the development and understanding of organometallic reagents and catalysts, as well as on their application to the synthesis of structurally complex targets of biological significance. Particular attention is paid to the development and validation of catalytic methods for Carbon‚Äìcarbon bond formation. Long term projects of current interest concern alkene and alkyne metathesis, the development and use of pi-acids (platinum, gold etc.), iron catalysis and cross coupling in general. Moreover, the group is engaged in the development of novel donor ligands, including carbenes and compounds containing formally \\"zerovalent\\" carbon atoms. All methods are scrutinized by applications to the total synthesis and \\"diverted total synthesis\\" of natural products and pharmaceutically active compounds. Theoretical Chemistry The Department of Molecular Theory and Spectroscopy, led by Frank Neese, focuses on theoretical developments that extend the scope of computational methodology, especially for large molecules, and applies theoretical methods to study specific chemical problems, mostly in close cooperation with experimental partners. The activities of the group cover a broad methodological spectrum such as ab initio methods, density functional theory, semiempirical methods and combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical methods.

Quinn Wilhelmi, one of the organization's founders, often told students that \\"the three pillars of politics are money, bodies, and ideas.\\" Soon after the 2004 election, Kai Stinchcombe was trying to figure out what to do next. He had worked for the Kerry presidential campaign. After the election, he returned to Stanford and emailed a few list-servs suggesting they form a progressive student think tank to fight the influence of Stanford's conservative Hoover Institution. The email soon reached Dar Vanderbeck at Bates College and Jessica Singleton at Middlebury and they responded, proposing that such an organization could exist on campuses across the country. The Roosevelt Institute awarded the Roosevelt Institution its first major endorsement and a blessing from the Roosevelt family. Though Roosevelt's policy model initially favored extended in-depth research, it soon evolved to include more succinct legislative proposals that cater to busy politicians and staffers. In 2006, Roosevelt experimented with narrowing the scope of its agenda by voting on three annual \\"Roosevelt Challenges\\": improving socio- economic diversity in higher education, making America work for working families, and increasing energy independence. In 2007, the Roosevelt Institution merged with the Roosevelt Institute. There are six national policy centers that are consistent year-to year: defense and diplomacy, economic development, education, equal justice, energy and environment, and health care. Each center has a lead strategist who is responsible for working with individual students on policy ideas, writing preemptive policy analyses on national legislation, and guiding the organization‚Äôs policy focused initiatives. As of 2012, Roosevelt ran three concurrent programs: The Washington Academy, The Chicago Academy and The New York City Academy. The Washington Academy placed twenty students at the Roosevelt Institution's national office as well as at organizations such as the Center for American Progress, the Economic Policy Institute, the AFL-CIO, National Security Network, NDN, and Center for Community Change. The Chicago Academy placed ten students with different Chicago City Agencies where they worked on energy and environmental policy in an urban setting.

Biography John was the third but second surviving son of John Cheyne (or Cheney) of Shurland Hall in Kent, by his wife, Eleanor, daughter and sole heiress of Sir Robert Shottesbrooke of Faringdon in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He was the uncle of Thomas Cheyne, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and grand-uncle of Tudor soldier and MP John Cheyne. In the 1460s he was appointed Esquire of the body to Elizabeth Woodville, Queen of Edward IV. He was MP for Wiltshire in 1478, and in 1479 was appointed Master of the Horse. In the same year he married Margaret Chideock, eldest daughter of Sir John Chideock, and widow of William Stourton, 2nd Baron Stourton. Some sources say that they had a son who predeceased his father. He was present when the Treaty of Picquigny was signed in 1475, and remained behind as a hostage of King Louis XI of France until King Edward IV had gone back to Calais and thence to England. After the death of Edward, and the seizure of the crown by Richard III, Cheyne switched sides to support Henry Tudor's claim to the throne by whom he was knighted in 1483 after their arrival in England from exile. He fought in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth Field. When Richard III launched his last charge directly at Henry, Cheyne was part of Henry's personal bodyguard. Richard unhorsed him with a blow from his broken lance. He fought again at the Battle of Stoke in 1487. In 1486 he was made a Knight of the Garter and was called to parliament as Baron Cheyne. He lived at Faulston Cheyne in Wiltshire and Enborne in Berkshire. Nicknamed the \\"Vigorous Knight\\" by contemporaries, he was a massive man of redoubtable strength. A 21\\" thighbone, found in his tomb at Salisbury Cathedral in the 18th century, puts his estimated height at 6 feet 8 inches. He had no surviving issue and the title died with him. His estates passed to his brother Robert.

The class of Fourier integral operators contains differential operators as well as classical integral operators as special cases. A Fourier integral operator T is given by: :(Tf)(x)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{2\\\\pi i \\\\Phi(x,\\\\xi)}a(x,\\\\xi)\\\\hat{f}(\\\\xi) \\\\, d\\\\xi where \\\\hat f denotes the Fourier transform of f, a(x,\\\\xi) is a standard symbol which is compactly supported in x and \\\\Phi is real valued and homogeneous of degree 1 in \\\\xi. It is also necessary to require that \\\\det \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial x_i \\\\, \\\\partial \\\\xi_j}\\\\right) eq 0 on the support of a. Under these conditions, if a is of order zero, it is possible to show that T defines a bounded operator from L^{2} to L^{2}. Examples One motivation for the study of Fourier integral operators is the solution operator for the initial value problem for the wave operator. Indeed, consider the following problem: : \\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2}(t,x) = \\\\Delta u(t,x) \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{for} \\\\quad (t,x) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^+ \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^n, and : u(0,x) = 0, \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t}(0,x) = f(x), \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{for} \\\\quad f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}'(\\\\mathbb{R}^n). The solution to this problem is given by u(t,x) = \\\\frac{1}{(2 \\\\pi)^n} \\\\int \\\\frac{e^{i (\\\\langle x,\\\\xi \\\\rangle + c t  \\\\xi )}}{2 i \\\\xi } \\\\hat f (\\\\xi) \\\\, d \\\\xi - \\\\frac{1}{(2 \\\\pi)^n} \\\\int \\\\frac{e^{i (\\\\langle x,\\\\xi \\\\rangle - c t  \\\\xi )}}{2 i \\\\xi } \\\\hat f (\\\\xi) \\\\, d \\\\xi . These need to be interpreted as oscillatory integrals since they do not in general converge. This formally looks like a sum of two Fourier integral operators, however the coefficients in each of the integrals are not smooth at the origin, and so not standard symbols. If we cut out this singularity with a cutoff function, then the so obtained operators still provide solutions to the initial value problem modulo smooth functions. Thus, if we are only interested in the propagation of singularities of the initial data, it is sufficient to consider such operators. In fact, if we allow the sound speed c in the wave equation to vary with position we can still find a Fourier integral operator that provides a solution modulo smooth functions, and Fourier integral operators thus provide a useful tool for studying the propagation of singularities of solutions to variable speed wave equations, and more generally for other hyperbolic equations.

Station layout  The station consists of an island platform serving two tracks on an embankment. There is no station building. From the access road, an underpass leads, through the embankment, to the platform. An enclosed shelter has been built over the underpass opening on the platform as a waiting room for passengers. A bike shed is located at the base of the embankment near the entrance to the underpass. Adjacent stationsHistory Japanese Government Railways (JGR) built the station in the 1930s during the development of an alternative route for the Nagasaki Main Line along the coast of the Ariake Sea which was at first known as the Ariake Line. The track was built from to , opening on 9 March 1930, and then to , opening on 30 November 1930. In the next phase of expansion, the track was extended to which opened on 16 April 1934 as the new southern terminus. Hizen-Iida was opened on the same day as an intermediate station along the new stretch of track. On 1 December 1934, the entire route was completed and through-traffic achieved from Hizen-Yamaguchi through the station to Nagasaki. The track was then redesignated as part of the Nagasaki Main Line. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, control of the station passed to JR Kyushu.

Described by one historian as \\"quarrelsome, violent and contemptuous of all authority\\", Egremont was involved in numerous riots and disturbances in the northern localities, and became a leading figure in the internecine Percy‚ÄìNeville feud. When the Wars of the Roses began mid-decade, Egremont fought for the king on the Lancastrian side, being killed five years later at the Battle of Northampton. Early years His youth was rarely peaceful; at the age of twenty five he was part of a force that engaged the tenants of the Archbishop of York, John Kemp in a physical confrontation (possibly to the disapproval of his father and elder brother, Henry, Lord Poynings, although it is equally possible that he began a 'propaganda campaign' against Kemp at the same time) outside the village of Stamford Bridge. Following the skirmish with the men of Beverley, he was subsequently imprisoned at York Castle- the direct result, it has been suggested of the Archbishop manipulating the jury and County Sheriff, whilst getting his own tenants released instead. It is possible that the king's clear support for the Archbishop, notwithstanding their position as one of the region's greatest magnatial families, was influential in their decision to later feud with the Percies rather than take it to the king for arbitration. Conflict in the north was not only over local rivalries; English relations with Scotland periodically descended into warfare throughout the Middle Ages, and the mid-fifteenth century was no exception. However, Egremont seems not to have been part of the campaign of October 1448, when his father the earl and his brother Lord Poyning's led an army of 6,000 men across the border only to be routed at the Battle of Sark; Poynings himself was captured, to be eventually ransomed by the Scots.Historic Scotland, Inventory of Historic Battlefields- Sark 1448 (2013), 2-5 Lands and estates Cockermouth, in Cumberland, held by Thomas Percy, was a traditional Percy Honour, as was that of Egremont; it is likely to have been due to his father's influence at court, as the earl of Northumberland was currently a Royal Councillor, and his connections with the king's chief minister Cardinal Beaufort that on 20 November 1449 he was made Lord Egremont by Letters Patent, drawing ¬£10 per annum from the county revenues. This figure reflects the fact that Egremont was never to be a wealthy man; it has been calculated that the Percy Cumberland estates suffered a decline of 25% between 1416 and 1470. Equally diminishing to Egremont's income was the fact that the barony itself had been divided threeways through inheritances, and at least one-third of it- that of the Fitzwalter family- had been granted to the earl of Salisbury under a 40-year lease at the time of Thomas Percy's grant.; for the FitzWalter's third of the barony, p. 127 Percy-Neville feud It is not certain exactly when the bad blood between the two families begun; A. J. Pollard has pointed out that they were cooperating together over parliamentary elections in 1449, and as late as 1453; indeed, the former husting was attended by Sir Thomas Percy shortly before his elevation to the peerage.

It is also known as the \\"short- necked oil beetle\\". It had been thought that the beetle had been extinct in the UK since the 1940s, due to intensive farming. However, in 2007 a small population was discovered in south of Devon. In 2010, 40 beetles were found on four sites on the Hebridean island of Coll. The beetle is flightless and has parasitic young that depend on solitary nesting bees for survival, raising the question of how it arrived on the island. Jeanne Robinson, the curator of entomology at Glasgow Museums said: \\"They are very vulnerable to disturbance and what the Devon and Coll sites have in common is that they have been relatively undisturbed for a long time.... We are hoping there is the potential to do some genetic analysis to see where the population came from.\\" There are records of the beetle being found in Ireland and it is possible the colony had been dispersed from there.Ross, John (16 July 2010) \\"Beetle mania as 'extinct' insect found on Scots isle\\".

Family Thomas Stanley was the eldest son of George Stanley, 9th Baron Strange and Joan Strange, daughter and heiress of John Strange, Lord Strange of Knockin, by his first wife, Jacquette Woodville, daughter of Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers. He was the grandson of Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, and Eleanor Neville, fourth daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, by Alice Montagu, the daughter and heiress of Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury. After the death of his first wife, Eleanor Neville, Thomas Stanley's grandfather married Margaret Beaufort, widow of Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond, and mother of King Henry VII.. Stanley had four brothers, Anthony, John, Sir James and George, and five sisters, Elizabeth, wife of Sir Edward Stanley, Eleanor, Katherine, Joan, who married Sir Robert Sheffield, and Margaret, wife of John Osbaldeston, esquire.. Career As a result of his marriage to Joan Strange, Thomas Stanley's father, George, had been summoned to Parliament by writs directed to Georgio Stanley de la Strange, by which he became Lord Strange. George Stanley died at Derby House, London, on 4 or 5 December 1503, predeceasing his father. He was said to have been poisoned at a banquet.. A year later Thomas Stanley's grandfather, the 1st Earl, died at Lathom in Lancashire on 9 November 1504, and Thomas succeeded to the earldom of Derby and the barony of Stanley.. When his mother died at Colham Green, Middlesex, on 20 March 1514, Derby inherited the baronies of Strange and Mohun. Derby was at the Battle of the Spurs in 1513. Both he and his wife were in attendance at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in June 1520, and Derby attended the King at his meeting with the Emperor Charles V at Dover later that year. In the same year, Derby became a member of Gray's Inn. Derby died at Colham Green, Middlesex, on 23 May 1521, and was buried at Syon. His widow, Anne, died at Colham Green, and was buried 17 November 1550.; . Derby's line failed with the death of James Stanley, 10th Earl of Derby in 1736, when the earldom passed to a descendant of his younger brother, Sir James Stanley, ancestor of the Stanleys of Bickerstaffe. Marriage and issue Derby was betrothed in 1498 to Elizabeth Wells, the daughter of John Welles, 1st Viscount Welles, by Cecily of York, the daughter of King Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. A papal dispensation was obtained for the marriage. However Elizabeth died that year. By indenture dated 17 December 1505 Derby married Anne Hastings, the daughter of Edward Hastings, 2nd Baron Hastings, and Mary Hungerford, and by her had two sons and a daughter:. *Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby *Margaret Stanley (d. shortly after January 1534), who married Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex, and by him had two daughters, Jane, who married Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montague, and Anne, who married Thomas Wharton, 2nd Baron Wharton. *John Stanley (died young).Complete Peerage 2nd Ed. Vol 4 p.209 footnote (a) Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby, and Shakespeare The failure of Thomas Stanley's grandfather, Lord Stanley, to come to the aid of King Richard III at Bosworth contributed to King Richard's defeat. Lord Stanley, who was by then married to the future Henry VII's mother, Margaret Beaufort, is given a major role in Shakespeare's Richard III. Lord Stanley's son, George, Thomas Stanley's father, was held hostage by King Richard, as noted in this speech given to Lord Stanley in Act IV, scene v of the play: Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me: That in the sty of the most deadly boar My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold; If I revolt, off goes young George's head; The fear of that holds off my present aid.

Scipio (fl. 174 BC), Roman praetor in 174 BC, was the younger son of Scipio Africanus, the great Roman general and statesman by his wife Aemilia. He was the son and grandson of Roman consuls, but his own personal life and political career was vitiated by his dissolute habits and possibly by his continued ill-health. Early life Nothing is known about Lucius's early life, except that he was born during the Second Punic War. If his parents married circa 212 BC (possibly earlier or later), and if he had an elder brother, he was probably born around 210 BC or 209 BC when his father was already in Spain. In that case, he would have spent his entire childhood seeing little of his father who was winning Rome territories in Spain and then defeating Hannibal at Zama. Lucius is most notable for probably being the unnamed son who was captured by pirates circa 192 BC. This son was released without ransom by Antiochus III of Syria before the Battle of Magnesia (190 BC). The fact that Scipio paid no ransom for his son's release would cause him political problems with the Senate two years later. It is possible that Lucius learned in Syria the dissolute habits and lifestyle which marked the rest of his life. Later life In 174 BC, he was elected praetor with the help of his father's former scribe, Gaius Cicereius, now a considerably wealthy freedman. However, in the same year, he was expelled by the Senate, in a low point for the Scipiones. His date of death is unknown, but he probably died between 174 BC and 170 BC. It is possible that his death, which left his brother with no male heirs, forced the brother Publius to adopt his own first cousin as his heir. This adoptive son would be Scipio Aemilianus.

Wood was a very popular singer of that era, and recorded many albums for Vicor Records. In Despair is dominated by remakes of popular American songs from the 1950s and 1960s. Three songs here were originally hits for Little Richard in the 1950s, and include \\"Jenny Jenny,\\" \\"Rip It Up,\\" and \\"Good Golly Miss Molly.\\" The album has an assortment of slow and fast songs, and the ballads include \\"In Despair,\\" \\"Vaya Con Dios,\\" \\"Have a Good Time,\\" \\"Hurt,\\" and \\"Return to Me.\\" The album's ballads are highly conducive to karaoke singing, and a number of them are often heard in karaoke nightspots. Throughout In Despair, Wood sings in a strong but soothing voice. His performances are always passionate and very sincere. Another of the album's upbeat songs is the remake of Roy Orbison's \\"Pretty Woman.\\" Wood's version retains the famous guitar line of the original, but adds a distinctive fuzz tone to it. On Gene Vincent's \\"Be-Bop-A-Lula,\\" Wood sings in a rough-edged, gritty style, imbued with much passion and spirit. Wood's version of Del Shannon's classic \\"Runaway\\" is markedly different from the original, and is performed at a much slower pace and has a more introspective demeanor. The arrangement contains a hypnotic guitar riff not heard in the original. In Despair is very enjoyable, although it doesn't bode well that every song is a remake of an American song. * 1.

Eleven of the album's 12 songs are Philippine folk/love songs sung in Visayan language (the Visayas region is the central group of islands in the Philippines). The remaining song uses the melody of Neil Diamond's \\"Song Sung Blue,\\" but replaces the original English lyrics with those of the Visayan dialect. The album opens with the tender \\"Ihilak,\\" which moves in a slow, shuffle-like pace. Victor Wood sings \\"Ihilak\\" with depth and tenderness, and puts much warmth into his voice. \\"Ihilak\\" tells of a man's despair for the loss of his love: \\"What is the real reason/You just forgot good memories/You left me/I did not abandon my love for you.\\" The following song, \\"Gugma Ko,\\" uses the melody of Neil Diamond's '60s hit \\"Song Sung Blue\\" over new lyrics in the Visayan dialect, which tell about a man offering love to a girl during courtship. \\"Hain Nang Panumpa Mo\\" (Where Is Your Promise) tells of another love affair that left a man with a broken heart. Most of the songs are performed in a mournful minor key and have a mournful tone in both the melody and lyrics. The opening melody of the slow- paced \\"Mahimong Biya-an Mo Ako,\\" for example, sounds as though it belongs at a funeral, but is about a love that went wrong. \\"Ika-Duhang Bathala\\" (The Second God) is a pretty, tender song. \\"Tuba\\" (Wine) isn't about love, but is about wine that some people are enjoying. The song uses a folkish, polka-like rhythm that has an appealing quality. This album is very different for Victor Wood, who often performs remakes of American songs, but the difference is very much appreciated. * 1. Ihilak (I Cried) * 2. Gugma Ko (My Love) * 3.

Freud's model, which became integral to orthodox psychoanalysis, suggests that because women lack the visible genitals of the male, they feel they are \\"missing\\" the most central characteristic necessary for gaining narcissistic value‚Äîtherefore developing feelings of gender inequality and penis envy. In his late theory on the feminine, Freud recognized the early and long lasting libidinal attachment of the daughter to the mother during the pre-oedipal stages. Feminist psychoanalysts have confronted these ideas (particularly the female relationship to the real, imaginary and symbolic phallus) and reached different conclusions. Some generally agree with Freud's major outlines, modifying it through observations of the pre-Oedipal phase. Others reformulate Freud's theories more completely. H√©l√®ne Deutsch H√©l√®ne Deutsch (1884‚Äì1982) was one of Freud's first female pupils and the first analyst who made an integral, chronological study of woman's psychological development. In short, Deutsch claims that women have a passive-masochistic sexuality, they are born for reproduction and their development must be seen as different from the development of men.Fischer, Psychoanalyse en vrouwelijke seksualiteit, p. 103. Deutsch sees the female development as exceedingly difficult and tortuous, because at some point she must transfer her primary sexual object choice from her mother to her father (and males), if she is to attain her expected heterosexual adulthood.Juschka, D. M. Feminism in the Study of Religion, p. 88. According to Deutsch, the girl blames her father, not her mother, for the lack of a penis; thus, she stops identifying with her father and masculinity. Because of this relationship with her father, she develops libidinous fantasies of being raped. Thus, the rape fantasy is universal and non-pathological, a key part of female sexuality. Meanwhile, the girl identifies herself with her mother through the wish for an \\"anal child\\". When she recognizes her failure, a decline to the pre-genital stage takes place: a wish for the earlier active (phallic) clitoris. Masochistic tensions in the girl prevail and she longs to be castrated by her father. The desire for a child also becomes masochistic. Melanie Klein Melanie Klein, originator of the Kleinian school of psychoanalysis, agreed with the basic structure of the Oedipal situation, but argued that it originated at 6 months of life while subsequently continuing to be worked through during the time that Freud had previously articulated. She identified the recognition of triangular relationships as originating during this time with the start of the infant's burgeoning awareness of the mother's relationships with others. Nancy Chodorow Nancy Chodorow noted that Freud believed that males possess physical superiority and that a woman's personality is inevitably determined by her lack of a penis. Like Freud, but for different reasons, Chodorow emphasizes that the female Oedipal crisis is not resolved completely, unlike the male crisis: a girl cannot and does not completely reject her mother in favour of men, but continues her relationship of attachment to her. The strength and quality of her relationship with her father are completely dependent upon the strength and quality of her relationship with her mother. Chodorow claims that most women are genitally heterosexual, but they have other, equally deep relationships with their children and with other women, as a result of the primary relationship with the mother.Chorodow, Family structure and feminine personality, pp. 87‚Äì89. Thus, a girl represses neither her pre-Oedipal nor her Oedipal attachment to her mother nor her Oedipal attachment to her father. This means that she grows up with more ongoing preoccupation with internalized object relationships and with external relationships. Because a girl does not have to repress her pre- Oedipal and Oedipal attachment to father and mother, she reaches a more relational sensibility than boys. Chodorow illustrated this through studies suggesting that men love (and fall in love) romantically, where women love and fall in love sensibly and rationally.Chorodow, Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory, pp. 73‚Äì74. Luce Irigaray In Freud's model there is no place for femininity unless it is related to masculinity. Luce Irigaray, a student of Jacques Lacan, disagrees with the thoughts about the importance of the penis and phallic for women.Irigaray, Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un, p. 73. She hypothesizes that the reason the penis is privileged in Freud's model is that it is visible. This is also the reason that male sexuality is based, in early Lacanianism, on having (a penis) and female sexuality is based on lack. In Freud's paradigm, female desire is the desire for a baby to substitute for penis, thus female pleasure is derived from reproduction.Irigaray, Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un, pp. 57, 34. Irigaray disagrees: \\"How can we accept that the entire female sexuality is being controlled by the lack and envy of the penis?\\"Irigaray, Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un, p. 58. Female sexuality is not solely related to reproduction, but neither is it less valuable in reproduction, and thus it should not hold less social power.Irigaray, Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un, p. 59. Furthermore, she says that Freud is forgetting the mother-daughter relationship.Irigaray, Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un, p. 119. To enter the Oedipus-complex, a girl must hate her mother. Irigaray says this view makes it impossible for a girl to give meaning to the relationship with her mother.Irigaray, Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un, p. 120.

The site is a major source of comedy news in the UK. It also reviews comedy shows nationwide, including extensively at the annual Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and presents the Chortle Awards to honour the best stand-up comics working in the UK. In recent years, the site has also branched out into events promotion. History Prior to starting Chortle, Bennett, who graduated from Oxford University, had been working as a local newspaper editor for the Informer group of free newspapers in Surrey and West London. He started the site after the newspaper group expressed a lack of interest in running a website. After considering his areas of interest, he decided to start a comedy site, since IMDb and Empire already covered the market for film, and there were numerous music websites available. The site received some early support from investors during the dot com boom which led to Bennett working from offices in Brick Lane, London. After that company went bankrupt, Bennett continued the site, as he felt the comedy section of Time Out was not covering the breadth of comedy in the city in sufficient detail. However, the site was not financially viable for several years afterwards, so Bennett worked as a freelance for the Daily Mirror and Mail on Sunday to support himself. The Chortle Awards were launched in 2002 and in 2014 Chortle launched a comedy literary festival with talks by Monty Python's Terry Jones, and comedy actor Rebecca Front. Although initially operated by Bennett alone, the site grew into \\"a proper online publication\\" with a team of writers including Jay Richardson, Julia Chamberlain and Paul Fleckney, as well as guest contributions from individual comedians. Public perception The site is seen as a \\"one-stop shop for breaking news, reviews and all manner of inflammatory opinion\\" and is considered to offer some of the \\"more balanced reviews\\" of the annual Edinburgh Fringe. It has been said that for comedians, \\"a positive write-up from Chortle (particularly from editor Steve Bennett), is the holy grail of the Fringe.\\" Satirical website FringePig called it \\"the conservative majority of the industry; far more people read it than will freely admit\\".

This conflict was also the first in which New Zealand did not fight alongside the United Kingdom, instead following the loyalties of the ANZUS Pact. New Zealand decided to send troops to Vietnam in 1964 because of Cold War concerns and alliance considerations. The potential adverse effect on the ANZUS alliance of not supporting the United States (and Australia) in Vietnam was key. It also upheld New Zealand's national interests of countering communism in South-East Asia. The government wanted to maintain solidarity with the United States, but was unsure about the likely outcome of external military intervention in Vietnam. Prime Minister Keith Holyoake decided to keep New Zealand involvement in Vietnam at the minimum level deemed necessary to meet allied expectations. Initial contributions New Zealand's initial response was carefully considered and characterised by Prime Minister Keith Holyoake's cautiousness towards the entire Vietnam question. While it was considered that New Zealand should support South Vietnam, as Holyoake alleged; > Whose will is to prevail in South Vietnam? The imposed will of the North > Vietnamese communists and their agents, or the freely expressed will of the > people of South Vietnam? The government preferred minimal involvement, with other South East Asian deployments already placing a strain on New Zealand's armed forces. From 1961, New Zealand came under pressure from the United States of America to contribute military and economic assistance to South Vietnam, but refused. However, at that time, aircraft were tasked to deliver supplies to Da Nang on the way from RAF Changi to Hong Kong from time to time. In 1962, Australia sent advisors, as the United States had, but again New Zealand refused to make a similar contribution. Civilian Surgical Team Instead in April 1963 New Zealand confined its assistance to sending a civilian surgical team. The surgical team was initially made up of seven men and would eventually grow to sixteen, and remained in the country until 1975. The doctors and nurses who worked there were all volunteers from New Zealand hospitals. The team worked for civilians at the Binh Dinh Province Hospital, in Qui Nhon, an overcrowded, and dirty facility almost completely lacking equipment and bedding. It would be the last New Zealand Government agency to withdraw from Vietnam. New Zealand Army Detachment Vietnam (NEWZAD) Under continuing American pressure, the government agreed during 1963 to provide a small non-combatant military force, but the deteriorating political situation in Saigon led to delays. Not until June 1964 did twenty-five Army engineers arrive in South Vietnam. On the same day of their arrival, a small headquarters unit established in Saigon. Based at Th·ªß D·∫ßu M·ªôt, the capital of B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province, the New Zealand Army Detachment Vietnam (NEWZAD) engineers were engaged in reconstruction projects, such as road and bridge building, until July 1965. Non-military Economic Assistance New Zealand non-military economic assistance would continue from 1966 onwards and averaged at US$347,500 annually. This funding went to several mobile health teams to support refugee camps, the training of village vocational experts, to medical and teaching equipment for Hue University, equipment for a technical high school and a contribution toward the construction of a science building at the University of Saigon. Private civilian funding was also donated for 80 Vietnamese students to take scholarships in New Zealand. Military assistance American pressure continued for New Zealand to contribute military assistance, as the United States would be deploying combat units (as opposed to merely advisors) itself soon, as would Australia. Holyoake justified New Zealand's lack of assistance by pointing to its military contribution to the Indonesia-Malaysian Confrontation, but eventually the government decided to contribute. It was seen as in the nation's best interests to do so‚Äîfailure to contribute even a token force to the effort in Vietnam would have undermined New Zealand's position in ANZUS and could have had an adverse effect on the alliance itself. New Zealand had also established its post-Second World War security agenda around countering communism in South-East Asia and of sustaining a strategy of forward defence, and so needed to be seen to be acting upon these principles. The New Zealand headquarters established in Saigon in 1964 was renamed \\"Headquarters Vietnam Force\\" (HQ V Force) on 2 July 1965. The administration of the subsequent New Zealand forces was managed here involving military personnel from all New Zealand branches of service including Military Police.'Headquarters Vietnam Force (HQ V Force)'  URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/resources/unit-notes#hqvforce  (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 13-Mar-2019)'New Zealand HQ V Force Vietnam'  URL: http://premierstrategics.com/nzvietnam/nzhqvforce.html (New Zealand Vietnam Veterans) On 4 December 1965 a car bomb explosion in Saigon claimed the life of one member of HQ V Force and injured three others. No further HQ V Force members were injured during the remainder of New Zealand's time in Vietnam. Royal New Zealand Artillery (RNZA) Gunners of 161 Battery RNZA conduct a fire mission during Operation Coburg, 1968 On 27 May 1965 Holyoake announced the government's decision to send 161 Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery to South Vietnam in a combat role. The New Zealand Army Detachment (NEWZAD) engineers were replaced by the Battery in July 1965, which consisted of nine officers and 101 other ranks and four 105 mm L5 pack howitzers (later increased to six, and in 1967 replaced with 105 mm M2A2 Howitzers). 161 Battery was initially under command of the United States Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade for the first 12 months based at Bien Hoa near Saigon. Upon the formation of 1st Australian Task Force at Nui Dat, in Phuoc Tuy Province in June 1966, the New Zealand government was given the choice of allowing the battery to remain at Bien Hoa with the 173rd Airborne under U.S command or integrate with the Australian forces. It was decided the battery would join 1ATF and serve with Royal Australian Artillery field regiments. Forward Observers for the battery would patrol with all infantry companies of the Australian and New Zealand infantry while on operations, as they did with American infantry while the battery was under the 173rd, to direct artillery support when called upon. The gunners were noted for their key role in assisting the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, during the Battle of Long Tan, in which 18 Australians were killed holding off a regimental sized enemy force on 18 August 1966. The battery also played important roles during the Tet Offensive and the Battle of Coral‚ÄìBalmoral in 1968. The Battery left Vietnam in May 1971 after providing virtually continuous fire support usually in support of Australian and New Zealand infantry units for six years, with over 750 men having served with the Battery with a loss of five casualties during the period of its deployment. New Zealand Services Medical Team (NZSMT) Bong Song Hospital, circa 1969 New Zealand's military presence in South Vietnam was also increased in April 1967 with the arrival of the 1st New Zealand Services Medical Team, a 19-strong detachment consisting of medical personnel from the Royal New Zealand Air Force, Royal New Zealand Navy and Royal New Zealand Army Medical Corps under the US Military Public Health Assistance Programme (MILPHAP). The team's role was to provide medical and surgical assistance to South Vietnamese civilians and developing local knowledge in this field. The New Zealanders relieved a United States Army medical team at Bong Son in B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province. They also treated military casualties who were brought to the Bong Son Dispensary, including Army of the Republic of Vietnam personnel and Viet Cong prisoners. In June 1969 the team moved to the new 100-bed Bong Son Impact Hospital. The average bed-state was 92 and approximately 46,000 outpatients (mostly civilians) were treated annually before the team's withdrawal in December 1971. Overall there were 98 personnel involved over the four-and-a-half years of the Team‚Äôs deployment: 47 from the Army, 27 from the Air Force and 24 from the Navy. One RNZAF member of the NZSMT, Sgt Gordon Watt, was killed by a booby trap in 1970. Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (RNZIR) A soldier from W Company, 2RAR/NZ (ANZAC) in April 1968 In 1966, when Confrontation came to an end and Australia decided to expand the 1st Australian Task Force, New Zealand came under pressure to increase its commitment and did so. In May 1967, a 182-man rifle company, (Victor One Company) was deployed to Vietnam from the 1st Battalion of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment in Malaysia. The first Victor Company served a 6-month tour of duty. In December a second Victor Company was deployed to Vietnam and was joined by Whisky Company in December, both from the 1st Battalion. Both companies served in the 1st Australian Task Force in Nui Dat, Phuoc Tuy Province. Initially Whisky Company served under operational control of 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR) which arrived at the same time as Whisky Company, while Victor 2 Company continued to serve under 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2RAR.) A NZ Component was established at Nui Dat to manage national administration of the New Zealand contingents within 1 ATF.New Zealand Component (NZ Component) URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/resources/unit-notes (New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage) updated 13-Mar-2019 Following agreement between the Australian and New Zealand Governments in late February 1968, V2 Company and W Company and A, B, and C Companies of 2RAR were amalgamated to become 2RAR/NZ (ANZAC) Battalion (2RAR/NZ) from 1 March 1968. The new \\"ANZAC Battalion\\" was the only Australian battalion to have five rifle companies. The 2IC was filled by RNZIR Officer, Major Robert Ian Thorpe. In May 1968 Victor 2 was replaced by Victor 3. Hereafter the tour of duty for all RNZIR companies was extended to twelve months.Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, URL http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-conflicts-periods/vietnam/rnzir.htm (Digger History) On 1 June 2 RAR was replaced by 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (4 RAR) and the joint Australian and New Zealander infantry forces became 4 RAR/NZ (ANZAC) again with a New Zealander as 2IC, Major ATA Mataira.4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, URL: https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/U53499 (Australian War Memorial) Retrieved 7 January 2020 On 8 November 1968 the first Whisky Company left Vietnam and was replaced by a second Whisky Company. On 16 April 1969, 1 ATF was advised of a change to operational priorities, with top priority given to eradicating the Viet Cong presence and influence among the civilian populations, followed by the upskilling of the South Vietnamese military forces. These programs were known as \\"Pacification\\" and \\"Vietnamization\\" respectively as part of the \\"Winning Hearts And Minds\\" strategy being undertaken by the Americans. 1 ATF would be increasingly called upon to provide support to a number of civil community reconstruction projects and assist in the training of South Vietnamese forces. On 19 May 1969, 4 RAR was replaced by 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR) and the two RNZIR rifle companies merged with A, B and D Companies of 6 RAR to become 6 RAR/NZ (ANZAC). The battalion 2IC was RNZIR officer Major Neville Alan Wallace. On this tour Mortar and Assault Pioneer Sections were added to each of the New Zealand companies. The New Zealand infantry companies in 6 RAR/NZ played major roles in two extremely significant and successful operations conducted by the 1st Australian Task Force in 1969 and 1970. The first was Operation Marsden (3‚Äì28 December 1969) in which Victor 3 Company discovered the major part of the K76A Hospital in the mountains where local enemy headquarters were located and from which the hospital was the major provider of medical services to all communist forces in the area. Additionally, between Victor 3 and one other Australian company approximately 1.5 tonnes of pharmaceuticals were captured which was thought to be the largest amount ever seized in the war by allied forces. The discovery of the hospital would prove to be a major defeat for the Communist forces in the area.W3 Company - Service Stories: Operations ROSS and MARSDEN, URL: https://www.w3vietnam.org.nz/story_4.htm#enemy%20camp (W3 Company RNZIR Vietnam 1969‚Äì1970)Operation Marsden, URL: http://www.v4coy.com/operation- marsden.html (Victor Four Company - 6 RAR/NZ (ANZAC) Battalion, South Vietnam 1969‚Äì1970)'Long Tan to the Nui May Tao' URL: http://6rarassociation.com/docs/Long%20Tan%20to%20the%20Nui%20May%20Tao%20-%20%20Report.pdf (The 6RAR Association, Queensland) The second was Operation Townsville (20 March ‚Äì 23 April 1970) which resulted in Victor Company finding the headquarters of the main Viet Cong supply group and capturing the operational signals codes and one-time cipher pads used by the Viet Cong headquarters. As a result, senior U.S commanders including General CW Abrams, Commander USMACV were alleged to have referred to it as \\"the biggest intelligence coup of the war.\\" As with other infantry companies of the Australian battalions, the New Zealand infantry companies too sometimes conducted independent operations or were temporarily put under the operational control of 1 ATF directly or under other Australian Battalions or units, and conducted operations with them, e.g Whisky 3 Company's mortar section conducted numerous independent operations with 3rd Cavalry Regiment in 1970, and the Company itself spent some time on Long S∆°n Island directly under 1 ATF Command, and later under 8 RAR for some months, also in 1970.'September 1970 - W3 COMPANY ACTIVITIES' URL: https://www.w3vietnam.org.nz/timeline11.htmOPERATION Massey Harris URL: http://www.hq1atf.org/mharris.htm (Headquarters First Australian Task Force, South Vietnam, 1966‚Äì1972) Both RNZIR companies conducted a number of independent, company-level land clearing and mine sweeping operations providing security for Australian and American engineer teams. Several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) units underwent training under both New Zealand companies at various times.'Operation with the ARVN' URL: http://www.v4coy.com/operation-with-the-arvn.html (VICTOR FOUR COMPANY, 6 RAR/NZ (ANZAC) Battalion, South Vietnam 1969‚Äì1970)http://www.w3vietnam.org.nz/document/Op_RAVEN_FEB79.pdf At the end of April 1970, a new 2 RAR from Australia and new Victor Company from Singapore arrived and on 15 May, Whisky 3 (now six months into their tour) and Victor 5 merged with 2 RAR to became for the second time 2 RAR/NZ (ANZAC). The 2IC for this rotation was RNZIR Major Roy Thomas Victor Taylor. This tour continued to be focused mainly upon the \\"Pacification\\" program which 1 ATF had adopted as its first priority in April 1969.Grey 2008, p. 244. Whisky 3 Company was withdrawn without replacement in November 1970. To offset Whisky 3's withdrawal, in January 1971 the New Zealand government committed the 1st New Zealand Army Training Team (1 NZATTV) to Vietnam. 1 NZATTV was made up of advisors from all branches of service, a number of whom had served in the RNZIR companies and in other New Zealand branches of service. The team assisted an American training team in Chi Lang to train South Vietnamese platoon commanders in weapons and tactics.'Unit notes - Vietnam Veterans List - New Zealand Army Training Teams (1 NZATTV, 2 NZATTV and ATTV)' URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/resources/unit-notes#nztraining, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 13-Mar-2019 On 6 May 1971 Victor 5 was replaced by Victor 6 and on 22 May 2 RAR was replaced by 4 RAR. The final and sole New Zealand infantry company was integrated with B, C, and D companies of 4 RAR to become 4 RAR/NZ (ANZAC) for the second time.4 Battalion The Royal Australian Regiment (4RAR/NZ) ANZAC URL: http://vvaavic.org.au/4-battalion-the-royal- australian-regiment-4rar (Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia Victoria)/ This would be the final ANZAC Battalion before Australian and New Zealand combat troops were withdrawn in December 1971. The 2IC for the final ANZAC Battalion rotation was RNZIR Major Donald Stuart McIver. With the battalion's tour cut short, Victor 6's last operation was one of protecting the activities of 1 ATF's withdrawal from South Vietnam. As the last 1 ATF battalion left, 4 RAR/NZ moved the South Vietnamese forces fully into Nui Dat. The majority of 4 RAR/NZ withdrew from Nui Dat to V≈©ng T√†u on 7 November 1971. The Australians departed on 8 December and the New Zealanders departed on 9 December. One company from 4 RAR, remained behind until 12 March 1972 in order to provide security to rear details. Over the five-year period, more than 1,600 New Zealand soldiers of the nine NZ rifle companies engaged in a constant round of jungle patrols, ambushes, and cordon-and-search operations in both battalion and independently conducted operations, for a loss of 24 killed and 147 wounded. Additionally, RNZIR personnel served in administrative roles at the New Zealand HQ V Force in Saigon,HQ V Force Veterans, URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/unit/553 (VietnamWar.govt.nz) in support and logistic roles within the ANZAC Battalions at Nui Dat,ANZAC Bn Veterans, URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/unit/547 (VietnamWar.govt.nz) and in the 1st Australian Logistics Support Group (1 ALSG.)1 ALSG Veterans. URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/unit/529 (VietnamWar.govt.nz) Both New Zealand Army training teams consisted mainly of RNZIR personnel. Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) The Royal New Zealand Navy did not make a sea contribution to New Zealand's military involvement in the Vietnam War, but otherwise contributed personnel beginning in April 1967 with RNZN medical members being part of the tri-service New Zealand Services Medical Team (NZSMT.) Subsequently, a few served with the second of the two New Zealand training teams deployed to Vietnam after combat troops withdrew in 1971. Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) From 1965 the Royal New Zealand Air Force contribution was in the form of transportation with No. 40 Squadron RNZAF providing troop transport for New Zealand, Australian and some American troops, and No. 41 Squadron RNZAF providing resupply missions from Singapore. Over 20 RNZAF personnel served with a variety of U.S Air Force units as Forward Air Controllers, and a number of pilots and crew from No. 3 Squadron RNZAF served with No. 9 Squadron RAAF flying Bell UH-1 Huey helicopters which was based in Vung Tau. A small detachment of RNZAF A-4 Skyhawk pilots were also attached to a U.S Marine Corps A-4 Skyhawk unit. RNZAF personnel were numerous in the New Zealand Services Medical Team (NZSMT) and one went on to be part of the subsequent New Zealand Army Training Team (NZATTV.) RNZAF personnel were also posted to HQ V Force and worked primarily in Saigon in a range of liaison duties. The last RNZAF flight out from Vietnam was the evacuation of the New Zealand Ambassador in April 1975, just before the Fall of Saigon. One RNZAF member of the NZSMT, Sgt Gordon Watt, was killed by a booby trap in 1970, the RNZAF's only casualty of the war. A plaque and memorial to Sgt Watt is on display at the Ohakea Base Medical flight, and there is also the \\"Gordon Watt Memorial Award\\" for the RNZAF‚Äôs top medic award, named in his honour. New Zealand Special Air Service (NZSAS) In November 1968, New Zealand's contribution to the 1st Australian Task Force was increased by the deployment of 4 Troop, New Zealand Special Air Service, comprising an officer and 25 other ranks. The arrival of this Troop raised New Zealand's deployment to Vietnam to its peak ‚Äì 543 men. The Troop was attached to the Australian SAS Squadron at Nui Dat and carried out long-range reconnaissance and the ambushing of enemy supply routes, mounting 155 patrols over three tours until being withdrawn in February 1971, with the loss of one member. Although under operational command of the Australian SAS Squadron Commander when deployed into the field on operations, 4 Tp NZSAS was an independent command and self-sufficient. Corps of Royal New Zealand Engineers (RNZE) Each time New Zealand military contribution to South Vietnam increased, a work party of the Corps of Royal New Zealand Engineers was sent to assist in preparing the site for the new arrivals. These RNZE Detachments helped set up the NZ artillery battery when it moved to Nui Dat in September 1966 and again for Victor One Company RNZIR from early November to December 1967. The final detachment was sent to assist 1 NZATTV establish themselves in Chi Lang in November 1970. This detachment stayed in South Vietnam until February 1971. Other personnel of the RNZE also served in the 1st Australian Logistics Support Group (1 ALSG), at HQ V Force headquarters, and with 198 Works Section, Royal Australian Engineers.https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/sites/default/files/documents/honours- awards/bennett-bem.pdf Sappers from the Royal New Zealand Engineers accompanied the RNZIR infantry patrols as Assault pioneers to assist with mine clearing and Combat engineering tasks. Several RNZE personnel also served in these capacities with the NZSAS. Two RNZE sappers were killed while serving with the RNZIR infantry companies. Additionally, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Charles Fenton RNZE, was administratively in charge of all New Zealand forces in Vietnam, at the New Zealand Headquarters in Saigon (V Force HQ) from 25 July 1968 to 30 July 1970. Royal New Zealand Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (RNZEME) When 161 Battery, RNZA arrived in Vietnam in 1965 a detachment of engineers from the Royal New Zealand Electrical and Mechanical Engineers formed the Logistic Support Element (LSE), to service the battery. 161 Bty served under command of the U.S 173rd Airborne Brigade from 1965‚Äì1966. When the 1st Australian Task Force was established and moved to Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy Province in 1966, the LSE was detached from the battery and established within the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group (1 ALSG) at Vung Tau. RNZEME personnel who had been in the LSE were taken for the most part into the Light Aid Detachment (LAD) of the Australian Artillery Field Regiment which 161 Bty was integrated with. RNZEME tradesmen also served with the New Zealand Services Medical Team in the town of Bong Son, in the Binh Dinh Province. Some RNZEME personnel served in the RNZIR rifle companies, the ANZAC Battalions (Command & Support), as well as at the New Zealand V Force HQ in Saigon. The initial NEWZAD deployment included a few RNZEME personnel, as did the latter NZATTV. Royal New Zealand Army Ordnance Corps (RNZAOC) The Royal New Zealand Army Ordnance Corps did not contribute a standalone unit to Vietnam but provided individuals to serve in various Australian and New Zealand units. A number of RNZAOC personnel initially served with the New Zealand Logistic Support Element (LSE) which supported 161 Battery RNZA during its time serving under the U.S 173rd Airborne Brigade and before the LSE was detached from the battery and incorporated into the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group (1 ALSG) at Vung Tau in 1966. Some 50 RNZAOC personnel served in the headquarters of 1 ALSG thereafter. Along with other New Zealand branches of service, RNZAOC personnel went about their business with their Australian counterparts in all aspects of 1 ALSG's support functions for Australian and New Zealand forces in Vietnam. Other RNZAOC members served with the New Zealand headquarters (HQ V Force) in Saigon, 1 ATF headquarters at Nui Dat, 161st (Independent) Reconnaissance Flight, 161 Battery RNZA, and the RNZIR rifle companies. One member also served in 1 NZATTV. Royal New Zealand Armoured Corps (RNZAC) The Royal New Zealand Armoured Corps was not represented as its own unit in Vietnam and members instead served within other New Zealand and Australian units including 161 Bty RNZA, V Force HQ, the ANZAC Battalions (Command and Support), the RNZIR companies, 1 ALSG, and in the NZAATV teams. Several members served as tank crew with the 3rd Cavalry Regiment of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps, and 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment (U.S Army.) Two RNZAC pilots served with the Australian 161st (Independent) Reconnaissance Flight.https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/sites/default/files/documents/honours- awards/flanagan-dfc.pdf Additional short-term postings included detachments to several U.S Cavalry units. Royal New Zealand Army Medical Corps (RNZAMC) A New Zealand nurse from the RNZAMC in Vietnam, circa 1971 Most personnel from the Royal New Zealand Army Medical Corps served with the New Zealand Services Medical Team (NZSMT) or served as medics for 161 BtyBritish Empire Medal (BEM) James Michael Benyon, URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/sites/default/files/documents/honours- awards/benyon-bem.pdf and the New Zealand infantry companies, or were otherwise stationed at the New Zealand V Force Headquarters in Saigon and at 1 ALSG. After combat troop withdrawals in 1971 several RNZAMC personnel were part of the NZAATV teams. Royal New Zealand Army Service Corps (RNZASC) Although the Royal New Zealand Army Service Corps was not represented as a unit in the New Zealand contingent to Vietnam over 140 RNZASC personnel served throughout the war providing transport and logistics for 161 Bty RNZA, both RNZIR companies, and 4 Troop NZSAS, as well as in administration and advisory roles in New Zealand V Force HQ in Saigon, 1 ALSG, and as members of 1 NZATTV. Royal New Zealand Corps of Signals (RNZSigs) Members of the Royal New Zealand Corps of Signals served in all New Zealand units in Vietnam, including RNZA, RNZIR, NZSAS, V Force HQ and as part of the NZ Component at Nui Dat. Some served as intelligence officers with 1ATF. The last commander of 1NZATTV (5 Dec 1972 ‚Äì 13 Dec 1972), Major TD Macfarlane, was from RNZSigs. New Zealand Army Training Team Vietnam (1 NZATTV & 2 NZATTV) As American focus shifted to President Richard Nixon's \\"Vietnamization\\" program ‚Äì a policy of slow disengagement from the war by gradually building up the Army of the Republic of Vietnam so that it could fight the war on its own - the New Zealand government dispatched the 1st New Zealand Army Training Team Vietnam (1 NZATTV) in January 1971. This action was intended to offset the departure of the New Zealand rifle company, Whisky 3, which left in November 1970. Numbering 25 men from different branches of service of the New Zealand Army, including RNZIR, RNZA, RNZE, RNZEME, RNZAMC, RNZAC, RNZSigs, RNZASC, and RNZAOC, it assisted the United States Army Training Team in Chi Lang. The team helped train South Vietnamese platoon commanders in weapons and tactics. In February 1972 a second training team (2 NZATTV), 18 strong was deployed to Vietnam and was based at Dong Ba Thin Base Camp, near Cam Ranh Bay. Made up of members from various New Zealand branches of service including two members from RNZN, the team helped train Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK) personnel in weapons and tactics and first aid. This team also provided first aid instruction and specialist medical instruction at Dong Ba Thin's 50-bed hospital.'2NZATTV departure from SVN - 19 Dec 72', URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/photo/2nzattv-departure-svn-19-dec-72, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 2-Oct-2019 The two New Zealand training teams were withdrawn from Vietnam in December 1972.'Vietnam War map', URL: https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/vietnam-war-map, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 15-Sep-2014 New Zealand Attachments to United States Army, Air Force and Navy 37 New Zealand serviceman, mostly Commissioned Officers are recorded on the Flinkenberg List as having served with U.S detachments during the war.'About the Vietnam Veterans List', URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/resources/about-vietnam-veterans-list, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 13-Mar-2019 These were not always formal postings as such. Some of these attachments were planned as part of officers' career planning by Defence Headquarters; others were opportunity attachments through contact with Allied commanders at many levels. Of the 37 on the list, 20 of those were RNZAF personnel whom served as attachments to various units of the United States Air Force, as Forward air controllers. Two small RNZAF detachments were attached to U.S Marine Corps A-4 Skyhawk squadron VMA-311 at Chu Lai Air Base in January 1970 and October 1970. Three RNZN personnel served with the US Navy on a Junior Officer Exchange program in 1971, each posted on the aircraft carrier and destroyer off the coast of North Vietnam. New Zealand Attachments to Australian Army, Air Force, and Navy Five members from various branches of the New Zealand military whom had also trained as Army pilots served with the Australian 161st Independent Reconnaissance Flight. In 1967 two RNZAF pilots were seconded to the Royal Australian Air Force's No. 9 Squadron, which was flying UH-1 Iroquois helicopters as troop transports. Two more RNZAF pilots joined No. 9 Squadron in 1968 to fly helicopters, often in support of the Australian and New Zealand SAS. By 1971 16 New Zealand pilots had served in 9 Squadron. 10 members from RNZAC served with the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, Royal Australian Armoured Corps. 11 (some sources say 10) RNZIR personnel served as detachments to the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam which operated in Vietnam from 1962‚Äì1972. Distinctions and awards 161 Battery RNZA was awarded the United States Meritorious Unit Commendation for their service in South Vietnam while serving under the U.S 173rd Airborne Brigade. Many New Zealand individuals received military awards for activities in Vietnam, including American military service awards and citations. In 2019 the Australian government awarded the Australian Unit Citation for Gallantry to all members of 161 Battery for their part in the Battle of Coral-Balmoral. This is the first Australian Unit Citation for Gallantry offered to a New Zealand military unit. Withdrawal In line with reductions in American and Australian strength in Vietnam, New Zealand began the gradual withdrawal of its combat forces as the training teams were arriving. Prime Minister Holyoake said in 1971 that New Zealand's combat forces would be withdrawn by \\"about the end of this year,\\" and they were ‚Äì Whiskey Three Company went in November 1970, the SAS Troop and 161 Battery followed in February and May 1971 respectively, and Victor Six Company and the tri-service medical team left with the 1st Australian Task Force in December 1971, ending New Zealand's combat involvement in the Vietnam War. This may have been due to protests in New Zealand. One of the first acts of Prime Minister Norman Kirk's Labour Party government (elected in December 1972) was to withdraw both training teams and the New Zealand headquarters in Saigon. By then, a total of 3,890 New Zealand military personnel, all volunteers, had served in Vietnam from June 1964 to December 1972. New Zealand casualties during the Vietnam War were: RNZE: 2, RNZA: 5, RNZIR: 27, RNZAF: 1, NZSAS: 1, RNZAMC: 1 (for a total of 37) and 187 wounded. Two New Zealanders serving with the United States Marine Corps, one serving in the US Army and one serving with the Australian Army were also killed in action. The last NZ Troops left Vietnam on 22 December 1972. Protest Although New Zealand's involvement in the war was very limited compared to the contributions of some of its allies, it still triggered a large anti-Vietnam War movement at home. New Zealand protests were similar to those in the United States ‚Äì criticising the policies of the United States government and challenging seriously for the first time New Zealand's alliance-based security, calling for a more 'independent' foreign policy which was not submissive to that of the United States and denying that communism posed any real threat to New Zealand. Campaigns were also waged on moral grounds ranging from pacifist convictions to objections to the weapons being used to fight the war. In the early 1970s, anti-Vietnam war groups organised 'mobilisations', when thousands marched in protest against the war in all the country's major centres. While Prime Minister Holyoake and his government had their own misgivings about the viability of the war, they were consistent in their public belief that they were maintaining both New Zealand's foreign policy principles and treaty-bound obligations. Despite popular sentiment apparently against the conflict, especially in its final years, Holyoake's National Party was re-elected into government twice during the course of the war. Protest chronology: * 1967: Two members of the left- wing Progressive Youth Movement lay a protest wreath on Anzac Day in Christchurch and are subsequently convicted of disorderly behaviour. Further incidents follow at later Anzac Days as protestors seek to bring attention to their anti-war cause. * 1967: 21 arrests during an Auckland protest against the visit of South Vietnam's Premier, Air Vice-Marshal Nguyen Cao Ky. * 1967: On 29 October, a big fight between police and protesters occurs outside the home of the American consul at Paritai Drive in Auckland. * 1969: Flour bombs, paint and eggs thrown in protest over a visit of a high-ranking United States politician * 1969: Fire crackers thrown at an election meeting addressed by the Prime Minister with 30 arrests. *1970 January 15: US Vice President Spiro Agnew arrives in Auckland as part of a goodwill visit to US-allied South East Asian nations and is greeted by several hundred anti-war protesters. The protests turn violent after police attempt to disperse protesters. Both sides blame each other for the violence which results in many arrests. * 1971: Protests in Dunedin reach the National Party's convention in the centre of the city, resulting in scuffles with police and two arrests. On 30 April, a nationwide anti-war demonstration attracts 30,000 people to the streets demanding New Zealand's immediate withdrawal from Vietnam. There are also numerous protests at Anzac Day, especially in Christchurch, where anti-war activists attempt to lay wreaths commemorating the dead of both sides, or 'victims of fascism in Vietnam'. The protest movement is backed by Norman Kirk's Labour government which supports a prompt withdrawal of New Zealand troops. New Zealand troops are quickly withdrawn without much controversy after the Labour Party's return to office in 1972. The protests mark a split in foreign policies between the two major political parties of Labour and National. While National continues to support a stronger alliance with the United States, the anti-war protests convince the Labour government that a new and more independent New Zealand foreign policy is needed. The new foreign policy which follows as a result of these protests is the reason behind New Zealand rejecting visits from ships from the United States over anti-nuclear protests during the period of time after 1985. The anti-Vietnam War protests are often regarded as the beginning of the ANZUS alliance breakdown between New Zealand and the United States. The Vietnam War protests are still remembered on ANZAC Days in New Zealand for significance in the change of direction in New Zealand's foreign policy. Agent Orange The Ivon Watkins Dow factory in New Plymouth Like veterans from many of the other allied nations, as well as Vietnamese civilians, New Zealand veterans of the Vietnam War claimed that they (as well as their children and grandchildren) had suffered serious harm as a result of exposure to Agent Orange. In 1984, Agent Orange manufacturers paid New Zealand, Australian and Canadian veterans in an out-of-court settlement, and in 2004 Prime Minister Helen Clark's government apologised to Vietnam War veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange or other toxic defoliants, following a health select committee's inquiry into the use of Agent Orange on New Zealand servicemen and its effects. In 2005, the New Zealand government confirmed that it supplied Agent Orange chemicals to the United States military during the conflict. In December 2006, the New Zealand Government, the Ex-Vietnam Services Association (EVSA) and the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association (RNZRSA) agreed to, and signed, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) following the recommendations of the Joint Working Group, designated with advocacy for Veteran's concerns. The MoU provides formal acknowledgement of the toxic environment New Zealand Vietnam Veterans faced during their service abroad in Vietnam, and the after-effects of that toxin since the servicemen and women returned to New Zealand. The MoU also makes available various forms of support, to both New Zealand Vietnam Veterans and their families. New Zealand writer and historian, Deborah Challinor, includes a new chapter in her second edition release of Grey Ghosts: New Zealand Vietnam Veterans Talk About Their War that discusses the handling of the New Zealand Vietnam Veterans' claims, including the Reeves, McLeod and Health Committee reports, and the reconciliation/welcome parade on Queen's Birthday Weekend, 2008, also known as 'Tribute 08'. From 1962 until 1987, the 2,4,5T herbicide was manufactured at an Ivon Watkins-Dow plant in Paritutu, New Plymouth which was then shipped to U.S. military bases in South East Asia.http://www.safe2use.com/ca-ipm/01-05-16c.htm There have been continuing claims that the suburb of Paritutu has also been polluted.

The name stuck, and became the permanent name of the village when it opened in 1972. Lake Elkhorn is named for the Elkhorn branch of the Little Patuxent River; Elk Horn Farms was also the name of the Dasher farm. Street names are taken from the works of Paul Laurence Dunbar. Dasher Green is named for the 670-acre Dasher family farm purchased in May 1963 by one of the Rouse company land acquisition entities. The farm was systematically reduced in size from 1971 to 1978, with the last parcel sold for development in 1996. Street names are taken from the works of John Greenleaf Whittier. Hopewell is named for the 200-acre land grant, Laswell's Hopewell, patented to Thomas Davis Sr. on December 6, 1728. The street names are taken from the works of Vachel Lindsay.

It consists of four buildings, including the main School of Music building ‚Äì which contains Llewellyn Hall ‚Äì and the Peter Karmel Building. The School of Music's teaching encompasses performance tuition, alongside musicianship, musicology, sound recording, and ethnomusicology. History The School of Music was established under the name Canberra School of Music in 1965 with Ernest Llewellyn as the founding Director. The original plans for the School were prepared in the 1960s when the Department of the Interior recognized the need to establish centres for art and music study in the national capital, with the vision of providing high-level performance and practice. Sir Richard Kingsland, Secretary of the Department from 1963 to 1970, provided valuable support for Ernest Llewellyn's vision. The Canberra School of Music was established in 1965. It was first located in the Canberra suburb of Manuka and in 1976 moved to its current site on Childers Street between the Australian National University and the city centre, becoming the first purpose-built music school facility in Australia. Llewellyn's vision for the school was based on the Juilliard School; he regarded Isaac Stern, with whom he had studied at Juilliard and who was his longtime friend, as the \\"father\\" of the school. He set the School up with a hand-picked staff and a focus on the training of soloists, chamber and orchestral musicians. As part of his grand plan he also envisaged the development of a national symphony orchestra based in Canberra. This has never been established, although Canberra has its own professional part-time orchestra, the Canberra Symphony Orchestra, based in Llewellyn Hall. Responsibility for the Canberra School of Music passed from the Department of the Interior to the Minister for Education and Science, John Gorton. Control was transferred in 1974, and Sir Richard was the first Chairman of the Canberra School of Music. The Kingsland Room in the School of Music is named in his honour. The current School of Music building was opened in 1976. In 1987, the Canberra School of Music combined with the Canberra School of Art to create the Canberra Institute for the Arts. In 1992, it became part of the Australian National University. In 2001, the Peter Karmel Building was opened to house the Jazz and Percussion Areas, and the Centre for New Media Arts. An extension to the Music Library was completed at the same time. In 2004, the National Institute of the Arts was dissolved, with the Schools of Music and Art becoming part of what was then the ANU Faculty of the Arts. In 2007‚Äì08 the future of the School of Music came under review by the Australian National University. In 2012 the School of Music was subject of heated public debate, as the University responded to an annual running loss of $3 million, with a reduction in the University's internal subsidy and overhaul of the School's curriculum and staffing arrangements.Major cuts to ANU School of Music, ABC News Online, 3 May 2012, accessed 8 December 2012 The Head of School at the time, Professor Walter resigned shortly after in June 2012 to take up the Headship of the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts. Professor Peter Tregear, a graduate of the University of Cambridge and a prominent conductor and musicologist, was appointed to replace him and took up his post in August 2012 and resigned in August 2015. Kenneth Lampl, Head of School from March 2017-2019, has described the commencement of his tenure as a 'new era' A graduate and a former staff member of the Juilliard School, Lampl has said he is creating a 21st-century music program \\"whose purpose is to nurture outstanding musical artistry through the intersection of performance, composition and technology\\". He believes it is also grounded in Llewellyn‚Äôs original Juilliard-modelled conservatory style of musical training, and the school is continuing to link traditional elite performance training in classical, jazz and contemporary practices with cutting edge technological advances in audio engineering, mixing, song writing and multimedia. The School of Music is home to one of Australia‚Äôs finest recording studios and also offers an exclusive program in composition for film and video games. Staff Past and present staff include: * Kim Cunio (Head of School 2019‚Äì) * Kenneth Lampl (Film and Video Game Composition) * Larry Sitsky (pianist/composer) * David Pereira (cello) * Don Banks (composer) * Jim Cotter (composer) * Nicolette Fraillon, Director 1998-2002 * Alice Giles (harp) * Geoffrey Lancaster (fortepianist/conductor) * Dr David Worrall (composer) Location, grounds and buildings The School of Music complex is situated on the south- eastern edge of the Australian National University campus, between the School of Art and University Avenue, bordered on the north-western face by Childers Street. The complex itself consists of four buildings; two of which are demountables. The demountable buildings, which are joined, were installed in the 1990s and house some of the graduate facilities as well as some administration and technical capacity of the Music area and are colloquially known as \\"The Shed\\". The two permanent buildings, the main School of Music Building and the Peter Karmel building are both built in contemporary architectural styles. Building The main School of Music building was designed for the National Capital Development Commission in 1970 by architects Daryl Jackson and Evan Walker. The architectural works of Jackson at this time can be seen to be in parallel with those of noted U.S. architect Paul Rudolph, most notably his 1960s interpretations of Le Corbusier's later works. The following, taken from the Australian National University's Heritage Factsheet on the School of music, provides a physical description of the building and its architectural merits and heritage: The building is heritage-listed by; * Royal Australian Institute of Architects (Ref: R031); * ACT Heritage Register (Nominated); * Commonwealth Heritage List (Place ID ‚Äì 105636); * National Trust of Australia (ACT) Classification List: Classified. Refurbishments to the main School of Music building in 2008 after a storm caused serious damage to the roof have included the complete refurbishment of Llewellyn Hall. Llewellyn Hall The main School of Music building houses Llewellyn Hall, a 1,400-seat concert hall that not only hosts events of the School (including most of the Australian National University's graduation ceremonies), but is also the venue for concerts by musical organisations of the city (including the Canberra Symphony Orchestra, Canberra Youth Orchestra, Canberra Choral Society and The Llewellyn Choir) and the nation (such as the Australian Chamber Orchestra, and Musica Viva. The ACT government provides Llewellyn Hall $200,000 each year in addition to the ANU's $1.6 million annual funding for outreach programs. The 2010 Loxton Review of the Arts in Canberra recommended that in regards to Llewellyn Hall, \\"with such significant support, the ACT Government should leverage considerably greater benefits for the ACT arts and public, based more on a sharing arrangement, with extended and more affordable access. If this is not possible, it may be necessary to consider whether ACT public arts funding could be more productively invested in the arts and music elsewhere\\". The Loxton report also recognized the vital contribution the ANU School of Music provided the ACT public.Loxton P & Loxton T 2010. Report Review of the Arts in Canberra. Peter Loxton & Associates Pty Ltd Llewellyn Hall came about directly through the initiative of its namesake, Ernest Llewellyn, the founding Head of School and instigator of the Canberra School of Music project. Llewellyn's plans, drawn with renowned architect Daryl Jackson, provided for a large \\"lecture hall\\" (with seating for 1,300 people and full audio and lighting facilities), smaller rehearsal spaces, teaching studios and offices. Peter Karmel Building An addition to the School of Music is the Peter Karmel Building, opened in 2001. The work of MGT Architects, this building is discretely separate ‚Äì both in a site planning and architectural manner ‚Äì to the original building. The Peter Karmel Building was designed as a new freestanding addition to the Canberra School of Music to accommodate numerous practice and performance functions for the School, with specific accommodation of the Jazz and Percussion Departments and the Australian Centre for Arts and Technology (ACAT). The two-storey building forms a new Entry Court to the School of Music complex and provides integrated connections between practice and performance spaces in both the original School and new addition. The fa√ßade design commission by artist Marie Hagerty was intended to be an opportunity for the artist to work with the large-scale architectural forms in their three-dimensional landscape setting to create a patterning, 'marking', and enlivening of the glazed and solid surfaces of the building's exterior. The building, named after former ANU Vice-Chancellor Professor Peter Karmel, was designed and project managed by Guida Mosely Brown Architects in conjunction with commissioned artist Marie Hagerty. It currently houses the Centre for New Media Arts, the Jazz Department and the Percussion Department. It also contains the fourth most important performance space in the ANU campus (after Llewellyn Hall, the Theatre Arts Performance Space and Theatre 1, the Home of Canberra Repertory), the Band Room.

The market operates all year round and opens at around 6am} every day until the official closing time at 6pm. After 6pm, the day market transitions into a night market which runs until 10pm. Today, Ben Thanh Market welcomes more than 10,000 visitors per day to shop and visit. The market has nearly 1,500 booths with more than 6,000 small businesses selling wholesale and retail items from consumables to luxury goods. Currency exchanges are not required by some vendors but most prefer Vietnam's currency, Vietnamese dong.  Location  Iconic clock tower on the south side of Ben Thanh Market. Ben Thanh Market is situated in the center of Ho Chi Minh in Ben Thanh Ward, District 1. The market is located on an intersection of four busy streets. The main entrance or Southside is on Le Loi street/Quach Thi Trang roundabout, the Northside on Le Thanh Ton, the Eastside on Phan Boi Chau and the Westside on Phan Chau Trinh. The market was originally structured to be near the Saigon River. As a former wet market, the surrounding canals offered the convenience for boats to pick up and drop off items for trade. After being relocated in 1912 near the My Tho railway station (currently the Saigon bus station, the market possesses one of the most optimal locations in District 1.  About the Market = Day Market  Fruit stand inside the market Four main market gateways also serve as a directory for its customers. Each gate has a designated area to sell specialty items. For example, the southern gate is divided among garments, textiles, and clothing along with shoes, jewelry, and cosmetic products. The Northern gate is where people can find a variety of fresh fruits, fish and poultry. This is also where the food vendors are set up to sell common Vietnamese dishes like pho, broken rice, bun bo hue, bun thit nuong, banh beo, grilled seafood and desserts. The Eastside also offers edible goods that are packaged such as dried seafood and poultry, roasted peanuts, candied fruit, coffee beans, tea, fish sauce, herbs, and spices. On the opposite side, the Western gate offers predominantly arts and ceramics.  Night Market  Ben Thanh Market at night Ben Thanh Market is also very lively at night. At 6 pm UTC+07.00, vendors set up brightly lit stalls on two sides of the big streets Phan Boi Chau and Phan Chu Trinh. The stalls offer similar items to the day market but with a greater emphasis on food. Some street stalls expand into sit down restaurants offering tables and seats. Many locals gather to the area after work and it's also suitable for tourist as they offer western-style menus in English.  History  Old market New market The market developed from informal markets created by early 17th-century street vendors gathering together near the Saigon River. The market was formally established by the French colonial powers after taking over the Gia ƒê·ªãnh citadel in 1859 (see Citadel of Saigon). This market was destroyed by fire in 1870 and rebuilt to become Saigon's largest market. In 1912 the market was moved to a new building and called the New B·∫øn Th√†nh Market to distinguish over its predecessor. The building was renovated in 1985.Article from Saigon Today The original market started out in the early 17th century as an informal wet market founded by local street vendors. When the neighboring Gia Dinh citadel was overthrown by French imperialists in 1859, the market was properly constructed and declared a formal establishment along French Colonial lines. The original structure included a wooden thatched roof which would later be destroyed by fire in 1870 was rebuilt to become called \\"Les Halles Centrales\\". In 1912, the market was moved into the building people are familiar with today, using fireproof metal structure to become the largest and most central of the markets in the city. When all the vendors moved into the new market building the old building was not demolished but instead transitioned to a wholesale market known as the Old Market or Ch·ª£ Cu. As for the new market, the name changed to Ben Thanh Market to be distinguished from its predecessor. The name Ben Thanh derives from the words \\"harbor\\" (Ben) and \\"citadel\\" (Thanh). In 1985 the new market went under major renovations to keep up with the city's progress of a modern blend. Despite many restorations over time, the market remains one of the earliest and most iconic surviving structures of Saigon.  Architecture  Wooden vaulted ceiling Ben Thanh market has a total area of 13,056 m¬≤. The 100-year-old building has a unique Indochina design that stands out among the modern and contemporary buildings around Saigon center. Throughout the years, the market underwent major renovations to both the exterior and interior but the overall architecture remained with its iconic clock tower in the foreground. Since the building was constructed around the time of the French Colonial Era, the building holds strong French influence. Khuong Van Muoi, President of the city Architects‚Äô Association, said the build adopted some of its unique features from French architects. He mentions the orientation of the building and banners along the roof that extends over the market to provide shade. These designs were integrated specifically for natural air-conditioning.  Transportation  Ben Thanh Market is located on a busy intersection which can be accessible for buses and motorbikes. The Tan Son Nhat International Airport is located within the city limits and only 7 kilometers from the market.

The total turnover of commodity futures traded on your Exchange stood at Rs 83.98 lakh crore in FY2019-20. MCX offers options trading in gold and futures trading in non- ferrous metals, bullion, energy, and a number of agricultural commodities (mentha oil, cardamom, crude palm oil, cotton, and others). MCX was among the top global commodity exchanges in terms of the number of futures contracts trade, the latest yearly data from Futures Industry Association (FIA) showed. MCX launched the MCX India Commodity Indices (MCX iCOMDEX) series on December 20, 2019, which conform to the global best practices set by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). iCOMDEX series consists of iCOMDEX Composite, iCOMDEX Base Metals, iCOMDEX Bullion, iCOMDEX Gold, iCOMDEX Copper and iCOMDEX Crude Oil. Subsequently, MCX received regulatory approval for launch of futures contracts on MCX iCOMDEX Bullion and Base Metal indices. The exchange also set up a web-based application \\"ComRIS\\" (Commodity Receipts Information System) in order to maintain an electronic record of commodities deposited at the Exchange accredited warehouses and ensure flow of real time information from the warehouses. SEBI issued operational guidelines for participation of Mutual Funds and Portfolio Managers in commodity derivatives in May 2019 and subsequently, approved few custodial service providers as custodians in the commodity space. In February 2012, MCX had come out with a public issue of 6,427,378 It was the first-ever IPO by an Indian exchange and made MCX India‚Äôs only publicly listed exchange. From 28 September 2015, MCX is being regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Earlier MCX was regulated by the Forward Markets Commission (FMC), which got merged with the SEBI on 28 September 2015. Mr Padala Subbi Reddy (Mr P S Reddy) was appointed as MD & CEO of the Company for a period of five w.e.f. May 10, 2019. Prior to this Mr Reddy worked as managing director and CEO of Central Depository Services (CDSL). Commodities traded include - * Metal - Aluminium, Copper, Lead, Nickel, Zinc * Bullion - Gold, Gold Mini, Gold Guinea, Gold Petal, Gold Petal ( New Delhi), Gold Global, Silver, Silver Mini, Silver Micro, Silver 1000. * Agro Commodities - Cardamom, Cotton, Crude Palm Oil, Kapas, Mentha Oil, Castor seed, RBD Palmolien, Black Pepper. * Energy - Crude Oil, Natural Gas. The efforts that started in the fourth quarter of FY 2018-19 to migrate to 'Compulsory Delivery-based' contracts in all base metals were successfully completed in FY 2019-20. The launch of indigenously benchmarked deliverable futures contracts of Copper, Aluminium, Zinc, Lead and Nickel on MCX, has paved the way for the Indian market prices for metals to be discovered on an exchange platform in a transparent manner. This fulfills an important step towards development of domestic benchmarks which reflect domestic market fundamentals, while the delivery standards are in tune with international standards. Paving the way for introduction of Options with 'commodities' as underlying, the Government of India issued a notification on October 18, 2019, which widens the scope of commodity derivatives traded in recognised exchanges. Following this, SEBI permitted stock exchanges to launch 'Option in goods' in their commodity derivatives segment, in addition to existing 'options on commodity futures'. MCX has launched Gold Mini Options with Gold Mini (100 grams) bar as the underlying, and plans to launch Silver Mini 5 Kg 'option in goods' contract soon.

The triangle of land (the \\"corner\\") at the south-east of the junction of Logan Road and Old Cleveland Road was purchased by James Stone in 1875. He tried to get a licence to operate a hotel at the location but was unsuccessful so he brewed and sold ginger beer instead.

Ancient history Hafizabad is an old city of Punjab, Pakistan. In 327 BC, during Alexander's invasion of Punjab, the territory of the Sandal Bar was reported to be a well populated area. Large cities were located in this territory, and a lot of sub states were organised here under the presidency of maharajas and rajas. In the 6th century, Hafizabad was visited by the famous Chinese traveller Xuanzang. He moved to Sangla and stayed one night in a town, then called Jaipura, which was located near the village of Koriala . Medieval history In the beginning of the 7th century Rajput kingdoms dominated Eastern portions of Pakistan and northern India. In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of some western Punjab region. Eastern Regions of Punjab from Multan to the Rawalpindi in north (Including region of present-day Hafizabad) remained under Rajput rule until 1193. The Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire later ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominately Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region. During the Delhi Sultanate period a big city was situated at the site of the present village of Mehdiabad. But afterwards this territory became unpopulated and jungle-like because of shortage of water and Afghan incursions. This situation persisted until Mughal Emperor Akbar's period. Hafizabad was formerly a place of some importance, and is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as headquarters of a Mahal. Hafiz, the founder, was a favourite of Mughal Emperor Akbar. Ghalib Hussain Kharal Independence The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while Muslim refugees from India settled in the Hafizabad. Most of the refugees have since settled and inter- married into the local population. Hafizabad is away in the west from Gujranwala. Connection with the city is by Gujranwala Road or Hafizabad Road. On the Wazirabad ‚Äì Faisalabad Railway Section, Hafizabad is the eighth railway station. The distance to the city of Wazirabad is . Basically it is an agricultural city.

Fertile soil allow the cultivation of high quality rices. The average per month rainfall is between 50‚Äì75 millimeters. Rivers The Chenab River originates in the snow-covered central range of the Himalayas. It receives numerous smaller streams from the lower hills which depend upon rainfall. It breaks out from a rocky gorge in the hills, six miles (10 km) to the north of Bajwat District. Mostly people from Hafizabad take bath in that river. Sialkot flows downward from Marala Headwork and enters Hafizabad District near Kot Kkamer, a village of Hafizabad Tehsil. It forms a natural boundary between Mandi Bahauddin and Hafizabad districts. Another very famous place is Head Sagar Complex in which an Irrigation Canal is passing over a link canal. It is a very common and interesting place for new visitors in Hafizabad.  Industry  Major portion of the country's rice exports are from Hafizabad, which is sometimes referred to as the Land of Rice or City of Rice. Cotton power loom (weaving) is the second largest industry of Hafizabad. It is linked directly with the cotton market in Faisalabad and businessmen from Faisalabad deal directly with the cotton industry in Hafizabad. It plays an important role in the development of Hafizabad. This industry has been badly affected by the energy crisis. Before the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the per-annum income of Hafizabad just from rice was 15 million. Peshawar, Agra, Mithra, Calcutta, Karachi, and Sukker were Hafizabad's main clients. Up to 23 rice mills were there until the independence of Pakistan.  Agriculture  The following types of rice are cultivated in Hafizabad: Basmati 385, Basmati 386, Super Karnal, 1121 Sella, Ery Nine, Erey Six, Super Fan, and KS 282.

The company, founded in 1840, is the longest-established costume supplier in the world, and has supplied costumes to 37 films that have received the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, including the 2010 film Alice in Wonderland and, most recently, The Grand Budapest Hotel. Since its founding the company has stayed in family ownership for six consecutive generations, and is currently run by Chairman Tim Angel, CBE (Former Chairman, BAFTA; Former Governor, BFI) and his three children, Emma (Director of Fancy Dress), Daniel (Head of Costume) and Jeremy (Creative Director). Early years Morris Angel started his business in 1840 in the Seven Dials area of London, near Covent Garden, selling second-hand clothing and tailors' samples from Savile Row. Morris Angel's shop became popular with theatrical actors, who at that time had to purchase their own clothes and costumes for auditions and performances. It was a request from actors to hire rather than buy outfits for the duration of a performance that began the business model that remains in use by the company today. Morris Angel brought his son Daniel into the business in 1870, and seven years later, the family opened a shop at 119 Shaftesbury Avenue which still houses Angels Fancy Dress nearly 150 years later. Cinema and the Oscars With the advent of cinema, the Angel family made its second major diversification by supplying costumes to the new movie industry. Angels supplied its first Academy Award-winning costumes to Laurence Olivier's Hamlet in 1948. To date, 37 Best Costume Oscars have followed for work that the company has undertaken on major international films, including Star Wars, Titanic, Lawrence Of Arabia, The Great Gatsby, The Aviator, Memoirs of a Geisha and Marie Antoinette. In 2015, Angels provided costumes to four of the five films nominated in this category: Mr. Turner, Into the Woods, Maleficent and The Grand Budapest Hotel, which won the Academy Award for Best Costume Design that year. Twenty-first century The business currently has two divisions: Angels The Costumiers, based in North London, which supplies costumes to the entertainment industry, and Angels Fancy Dress, suppliers of fancy dress to the general public. The Angels warehouse in Hendon, north London, where the majority of their costume collection is stored, houses an estimated five million items on approximately eight miles of rails. Angels now runs public tours twice a month. The shop now houses four floors of fancy dress costumes available to purchase and hire. Angels Fancy Dress also sells costumes online. In 2015 Angels celebrated its 175-year anniversary, and to mark the milestone decided to hold an exhibition showing some of the company's most famous costume creations. Dressed by Angels, held at the Old Truman Brewery in London from October to November 2015, allowed the public to view more than 100 iconic costumes from the worlds of film, TV, and theatre. As a companion to the exhibition, Angels also brought out a book, Behind the Seams, which offers readers further insight into the workings of the company. In 2016, Angels won the BAFTA for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. Due to the shift from brick and mortar stores to online, Angels then launched Fancydress.com in 2001. Fancydress.com remains the UK's leading fancy dress retailer to this day. Trivia In September 2005, the original cloak worn by Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi in George Lucas's Star Wars film was rediscovered hanging on the rails at Angels. Having been unwittingly available to the general public for some time as a monk's robe as well as being used as a crowd-scene costume in films including The Mummy, the provenance of the piece was confirmed by John Mollo, who created the item for the film in 1977, and received an Oscar for his efforts. The Obi Wan Kenobi cloak was auctioned by Bonhams in London on 6 March 2007 for ¬£55,000. It formed part of a sale of 400 lots from the Angels archive ‚Äì alongside costumes from James Bond, Dr Who, and Highlander, as well as items worn onscreen by Ava Gardner, Errol Flynn and David Niven. In the late 1980s, fashion designer Alexander McQueen worked at Angels as a costumier, and Daniella Helayel of London fashion company uses costumes held at Angels for inspiration.

The valley has a number of temple clusters such as the Dandeshwar and Jageshwar sites. Some locations have attracted construction of new temples through the 20th- century. Together these clusters over the valley consist of over 200 structural temples built from cut stone. Many are small, while a few are substantial. They predominantly illustrate North Indian Nagara style of architecture with a few exceptions that show South and Central Indian style designs, many are dedicated to god Shiva, while others in immediate vicinity are dedicated to god Vishnu, Shakti goddesses and Surya traditions of Hinduism. Jageshwar is a Hindu pilgrimage town and one of the Dhams (pilgrimage region) in the Shaivism tradition. The site is protected under Indian laws, and managed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). It includes Dandeshwar Temple, Chandi-ka-Temple, Jageshwar Temple, Kuber Temple, Mritunjaya Temple, Nanda Devi or Nau Durga, Nava-grah temple, a Pyramidal shrine, and Surya Temple. The site celebrates the Jageshwar Monsoon Festival during the Hindu calendar month of Shravan (overlaps with July‚ÄìAugust) and the annual Maha Shivratri Mela (Shivratri festival), which takes place in early spring. There are other Hindu temples in the Himalayan region that are called Jageshwar Temple such as one in Dalash, Himachal Pradesh. Location Jageshwar is located northeast of Almora, in the Kumaun region. The temples site is on the south of the road, across which is an eponymous village at an altitude of 1,870 m, in the Jataganga river valley near a Deodar forest (Cedrus deodara). The temple clusters begin starting from satellite road branching off east from the Artola village on the Almora‚ÄìPithoragarh highway, at the confluence (sangam) of two streams Nandini and Surabhi after they flow down the hills in the narrow valley. The site is about long along the Jataganga rivulet, is a narrow forested valley of oaks, deodara, rhododendrons and pines. Around the valley is human habitation which provide services to the pilgrims and travelers visiting these temples or passing through to other sacred sites in the Uttarkhand region. The resident villages are Mokshadham, Dandeshwar, Jageshwar and Koteshwar. Jageshwar is about southeast of the historic Baijnath Temple and about northeast from the resort town of Nainital. It is mentioned in Hindu texts dated prior to the 10th-century as a tirtha (pilgrimage) site. The nearest rail head is Kathgodam 125 km. Jageshwar has direct road links with Almora (35 km), Haldwani (131 km.), Pithoragarh (88 km) and Kathgodam. State transport, and private jeeps and taxis ply from these place for Jageshwar regularly. History The temples at Jageshwar, believed to include the Nagesh Jyotirlinga. The origins of the Jageshwar temples site are unclear. Its remote location has limited its studies and scholarly attention. The site shows evidence of different architectural styles and building periods for both temples and stone steles, which range from the 7th to the 12th century, and then in the modern times. Estimates for the same temple or stele varies widely, sometimes 1,400 years. According to the ASI, some belong to the post-Gupta or the second half of 1st millennium while others belong to the 2nd millennium. Some colonial-era guesses attribute them to the Katyuri or Chand hill dynasties but there is no textual or epigraphical evidence to support or refute these proposals. Another prevailing theory is that Adi Shankara built some of these temples, but once again there is no textual or epigraphical evidence to support this claim. Instead, the architectural features and style of some of these Hindu temples is from early 7th century, which is about 50 to 100 years before Adi Shankara lived (c. 788-820 CE). Jageshwar Temple The lack of systematic studies of Indian temples and ruins in many parts of the remote Himalayan regions limits what can be said about the chronological sequence of monuments in the Jageshwar valley. According to Chanchani, it is likely that the valley had reached a prominent position in Indian architecture by the 10th century, with the earliest monuments from the 7th-century. The valley has two major clusters of Hindu temples and a number of roadside shrines. Of these some 151 temples have been numbered by ASI as protected pre-12th century monuments. The two largest groups are locally called as the Dandeshwar group temples (Dandeshwar samuh mandir, 15 temples) and the Jageshwar group temples (Jageshwar samuh mandir, 124 temples). Of these, temple number 37, 76 and 146 are the largest, all dated to the late centuries of the 1st-millennium . In the historic text, Jageshwar is also referred to as Yageshvara. Jageshwar was once the centre of Lakulish Shaivism, likely by monks and migrants who left the plains of the Indian subcontinent from places such as Gujarat and settled in the high mountains. The temple site, over time, was positioned as and grew as sacred geography in the form of northern (Uttara) Kashi (Varanasi). Description 7th-century Nataraja relief on Temple 1; Ganesha in upper right corner, Skanda-Kartikeya on his peacock in upper left, Parvati in lower left and a musician playing vadya in lower right. The Jageshwar group of temples are similar to some large historic cluster of Hindu temples found on the Indian subcontinent. For example, a similar cluster is seen near Bhubhaneswar, Odisha at the Lingaraja group of temples. Another large group of stone temples is illustrated at the Batesvar complex in Chambal valley of Madhya Pradesh.Michael W. Meister (1976), Construction and Conception: Ma·πá·∏çapikƒÅ Shrines of Central India, East and West, Vol. 26, No. 3/4 (September - December 1976), page 415, context: 409-418 Almost all the small and large temples in the Jageshwar valley, states Chanchani, have a \\"simple square plan sanctums bounded by plain walls and tiered superstructures\\". Some significant monuments in the Jageshwar valley include: *Temple 47, found at the Jageshwar site, is a Valabhi Nagara style superstructure with a wagon vault from the 7th or 8th century. Its western wall was capped with a Vinadhara Shiva stele (lute bearing Shiva legend, Shaivism), the northern wall with Ganesha stele (pan- Hindu), and the eastern wall with yoga performing Saptamatrikas (seven mothers, Shaktism tradition). *Temple 2, found at the Jageshwar site, is another early temple with a tiered tower in the curvilinear latina Nagara style. Its square sanctum is preceded by a short vestibule (antarala). The platform and base moulding resembles Temple 47. The tower is capped with a cogged disc (amalaka) and above it is a hypethral linga. The walls of this temple feature niches, while above the sanctum doorway is a dormer windom with three-face Shiva carved into it. The temple also has a 7th or 8th century relief carving showing Lakulisa seated on lotus in water, in a yoga asana doing meditation where gods approach him from the skies and yogis surround him. *Temple 145, found at the Dandeshwar site, is also a 7th to 8th-century temple but that exhibits yet a third distinct style suggesting an acceptance and proliferation of artist diversity. Its tower consists of stacked series of amalaka in the form of cogged discs of shrinking diameter. Below is the square sanctum (garbha griya) whose doorframe and mandapa are formed by square pillars. Inside the sanctum is a chaturmukha Shiva linga, each face looking at a cardinal direction. *Temple 76, found at the Jageshwar site, is another 1st- millennium temple at the site, but one that is substantial. It is dedicated to Mrityunjaya form of Shiva, or the one who conquered death. The temple is in the middle of lingas and smaller shrines, suggesting its importance when they were built. Temple 76, also called the Mrityunjaya Mahadeva temple, is a large temple with the latina Nagara style architecture. It has a four-pillared entry mandapa, then the mukha-mandapa (main hall) which leads to an antarala (vestibule) then on to the square sanctum. The tower is curvilinear. Its wall is covered with frieze and niches in a format that belongs to the 850-950 CE. The temple tower is a multistorey structure, but in the modern era is covered with a wooden canopy. Inside the canopy is the original cogged disc-shaped amalaka which is then topped with hyperthral linga finial. The Mrityunjaya temple follows the vastupurusha-mandala plan and elevation found in Hindu temple architecture texts. It has 16 central squares like the Mahua Hindu temple, the sanctum length equals the central offset, and the wall thickness equals the corner unit's length, proportions taught in the symmetric 16-grid plan. The temple was the first that included a pillared hall (mandapa) in front, and this hall was used for communal rituals and as shelter for pilgrims to rest in. This temple is also notable for its short inscriptions found on its mouldings, walls, pilasters, and pillars. D.C. Sircar dated these to be from the 8th to 10th century period. *Temple 37 is eponymously named as the Jageshwar temple. It is also large, has a mandapa, a vestibule, and a sanctum. However, it was likely built in 12th or maybe the 13th century, and the site evidence suggests it has been rebuilt a few times over its history. The temple integrated four entrances, included intricate carvings on its tower, and the superstructure is pyramidal with progressively receding stone blocks. The sanctum has two unusual dvarapalas added in the 14th-century or later. One four-armed dvarapala holds a skull in the tradition of the Pashupata-Kapalikas in one of his hands, a rosary in other, a fruit in yet another and the fourth hand cradles an object. At his pedestal is a bull, both on a lotus. The left dvarapala is similar, but differs in holding a serpent in his hand instead of the skull and other items. The symbolism of these dvarapala is to remind the pilgrim of the certainty of death for everyone and that when they pass through them they are entering the spiritual sanctum and the symbolism for liberation which exists eternally. Temple 37 remains an active house of Hindu worship. The temples are atypical than other Hindu temples build after the 6th-century. The Jageshwar temples have a design that deliberately does not anticipate their use as house of worship. The sanctum space in most temples is generally too small (~ 3 square feet) that a priest cannot sit inside, leave alone move around to complete a ritual. Further, most of the lingas do not provide for a drain from abhisheka, a feature that Hindu temples from Gupta and post-Gupta period include. There is no record of their being used for worship, nor traces at the site that would suggest unrecorded use. According to Chanchani, most of these temples may have been memorials to Hindu monks or saints, or part of dedication or grant to the monasteries. The site is additionally notable for rock steles featuring Hindu theological themes. Included in these are all four major traditions of Hinduism: Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism and Sauraism. Example steles include those of Ksemankari, Narayana, Revanta and Surya. Other significant reliefs include those of dancing Ganesha, seated and smiling Uma- Parvati and Saptamatrikas. Vinayak Kshetra One of the Devi shrines with barrel-vault vimana This place is 200 m from Artola village from where temples of Jageshwar starts. From this place Vinayak Kshetra or sacred area begins. This place lies between Jhanker Saim temple, Vrudhh Jageshwar and Koteshwar temples.  Sri Vriddha or Bud Jageshwar  This temple is situated Seven km north to Jageshwar. This temple is situated at the top of the hill and comes after an uphill trek. It is contemporary to Jageshwar group of temples. This temple is located at higher altitude  Pushti Devi or Pushti Bhagawati Maa  It is the temple of Goddess Devi. The temple enshrines the full murti of Goddesses. This temple is situated in the Jageshwar main premises.  Inscriptions  Over 25 inscriptions of different periods are inscribed on the walls and pillars of the Jageshwar temples. Most of these belong to the period between the 7th century AD to 10th century AD. The dialect of inscriptions is Sanskrit and Brahmi. These are studied by D.C. Sarkar in Epigraphica Indica. Significance The Jageshwar temple site attracts a few hundred pilgrims and visitors everyday. It remains a part of the Hindu sacred geography, particularly for the central Himalayan region. Many complete a part of the post-cremation last rites after the death of a loved one at the Jageshwar temple site. The temples are particularly popular in the late monsoon season. In other months, pilgrims typically combine their pilgrimage to Jageshwar Temples with those at Lake Mansarovar or Badrinath and Kedarnath, or other places in the Himalayas such as Gangotri. The site remains popular with Hindu monks and they continue to protect the site's sacrality.

Hansen began the company in 1874 as a joint venture with pharmacist H.P. Madsen. Initial products included animal rennet for cheese- making as well as annatto-based coloring agents for butter and cheese. Operations in the United States were begun shortly thereafter in 1878. Their lines soon expanded to include starter cultures for cheese, yogurt and sour cream. Hansen's son Johannes took over the company in 1916 upon his father's death. That same year, the company began production in England to bypass the German World War I blockade of exports to Great Britain and beyond. Facilities in Italy and Germany followed in 1936 during the inter-war period. Further international expansion followed, and the 1970s and 1980s saw a period of acquisition of other firms. In 1991, the Lundbeck Foundation obtained majority control of the company and initiated a major restructuring into a holding company format. Additional growth and consolidation followed, and Chr.

The bridge has four lanes for cars and two lanes for motorcycles and bicycles. It was the only bridge linking District 1 to the new Thu Thiem New Urban Area in District 2 until the Th·ªß Thi√™m Bridge opened in 2008 and the Saigon River Tunnel opened in 2011. The bridge was one of the most vital gateways for vehicles traveling from northern and central Vietnam to the city, and therefore was a key point of contention during the Tet Offensive in 1968 and the Fall of Saigon in 1975. In 2013, a new parallel bridge, Saigon 2 Bridge, was opened to ease congestion on the bridge. Vietnam War On 5 May 1968 during the May or \\"mini-Tet\\" Offensive, a 300-man Vietcong (VC) regiment attacked the bridge and the adjacent Newport dock facility but were driven off by Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces. On the morning of 12 May VC gunners from the 4th Thu Duc Battalion scored a direct hit on the bridge with a recoilless rifle, sending a chunk of steel-reinforced concrete almost sixty meters long and half the width of the bridge crashing into the river. The VC then promptly packed up his weapons and hustled away before helicopter gunships could retaliate. For the Allies, the damage inflicted on the bridge proved to be little more than an inconvenience. The temporary loss of one lane did not seriously impede traffic, and over the next four weeks engineers repaired the otherwise intact bridge. By 28 April 1975 as the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) continued their advance on Saigon, the Vietcong seized the Th·∫£o ƒêi·ªÅn area at the eastern end of the bridge and attempted to seize the bridge but were repulsed by the ARVN 12th Airborne Battalion. On the morning of 30 April PAVN sappers attempted to seize the bridge but were repulsed by the ARVN Airborne. At 09:00 the PAVN tank column approached the bridge and came under fire from ARVN tanks which destroyed the lead T-54, killing the PAVN Battalion commander. The ARVN and PAVN continued to exchange tank and artillery fire until 10:24, when the ARVN commander received President D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh's capitulation order over the radio. While the bridge was rigged with approximately 4000lbs of demolition charges, the ARVN stood down and at 10:30 the PAVN column crossed the bridge.

It consolidated much of the UK's maritime legislation, repealing several Acts in their entirety and provisions in many more, some dating back to the mid-nineteenth century. It appoints several officers of Admiralty Jurisdiction such as the Receiver of Wreck. The Act of 1995 updates the prior Merchant Shipping Act 1894. The lead part on British ships was impacted by the outcome of the Factortame case, as the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 was impugned by the Common Fisheries Policy. Content of Act The Act comprises 316 sections divided into 13 Parts: * Part I: British ships * Part II: Registration * Part III: Masters and Seamen * Part IV: Safety * Part V: Fishing Vessels * Part VI: Prevention of Pollution * Part VII: Liability of Shipowners and Others * Part VIII: Lighthouses * Part IX: Salvage and Wreck * Part X: Enforcement Officers and Powers * Part XI: Accident Investigations and Inquiries * Part XII: Legal Proceeding * Part XIII: Supplemental Part VIII: Lighthouses Part VIII of the Act provides the powers and duties of the general lighthouse authorities and local lighthouse authorities. Part IX: Salvage and Wreck Receiver of Wreck is a post defined in Part IX of the Act. It is an official of the British government whose main task is to process incoming reports of shipwrecks in order to give legitimate owners the opportunity to retrieve their property and ensure that law-abiding finders of wreck receive an appropriate reward.Maritime and Coastguard Agency - Role of the Receiver Of Wreck According to the Act, a wreck falls into one of four categories: ; Flotsam : goods lost from a ship which has sunk or otherwise perished which are recoverable because they have floated. ; Jetsam : goods cast overboard (jettisoned) in order to lighten a vessel which is in danger of sinking, even if they ultimately perish. ; Derelict : property which has been abandoned and deserted at sea by those who were in charge without any hope of recovering it. This includes vessels and cargo. ; Lagan (or ligan) : goods cast overboard from a ship, which afterwards perish, buoyed so that they can be recovered later. Part XI: Accident Investigations and Inquiries Part XI of the Act provides the powers and duties of the Marine Accident Investigation Branch. Subsequent amendments The Merchant Shipping (Pollution) Act 2006 amended section 178(1) of the Act. It restricts claims to being enforced within three years of the damage occurring, whereas previously it had been restricted to within three years after \\"the claim against the Fund arose\\", and within six years of the damage occurring. The Marine Navigation Act 2013 made four changes to the Act: * Section 47 was amended so that regulations relating to manning requirements on ships may refer to information contained in other documents. * Section 193 was amended to specify the area of sea in which each Authority may operate. * Section 197 was amended and section 197A added to enable the general lighthouse authorities to enter into a broader range of commercial agreements. The income from these agreements will supplement revenue from light dues, used to fund the work of the Authorities. * Section 252 was amended to enable lighthouse authorities to mark wrecks by electronic methods as well as physical aids to navigation.

Life A sermon which he preached at Paris aroused misgivings in Catholic circles regarding the soundness of his ideas, and Bolsec left Paris. Having separated from the Catholic Church about 1545, he took refuge at the Court of Ren√©e, duchess of Ferrara, who was favourably disposed towards persons holding Protestant views. Here he married, and began the study of medicine, about 1550 settling as a physician at Veigy, near Geneva. A theological controversy with John Calvin, whose doctrine of predestination he deemed an absurdity, soon ensued. In 1551, at one of the religious conferences or public discussions, then held at Geneva every Friday, he interrupted the orator of the day, Jean de Saint Andr√©, who was speaking on predestination, and argued against him. Thinking that Calvin was not present at the oration, Bolsec was surprised to find that as soon as he had finished his argument Calvin himself stood up and refuted him point by point. Unable to respond to Calvin, Bolsec was arrested, and through the influence of the reformer banished from Geneva (1551). In 1555 he was also driven from Thonon, in the Bernese territory, whither he had retired. He went to Paris and sought admission into the ministry of the Reformed Church. But his opinions were not found sufficiently orthodox, from a reformed point of view, for one wishing to hold such a position. He was asked for a declaration of faith, but refused. He went to Lausanne (c. 1563), but as the signing of the Confession of Bern was made a condition of his residence there, he preferred to return to France. Shortly after this, he recanted his errors, and was reconciled with the Catholic Church. Works He published biographies of the two Genevan reformers, Calvin and Theodore Beza (1519‚Äì1605). These works are violent in tone, and their historical statements cannot always be relied on. They are \\"Histoire de la vie, des moeurs . . . de Jean Calvin\\" (Lyons and Paris, 1577; published in Latin at Cologne in 1580; German tr. 1581); \\"Histoire de la vie et des m≈ìurs de Th. de B√®ze\\" (Paris, 1582). The life of Calvin was edited by L. F. Chastel in 1875 with extracts from the life of Beza. In Alister McGrath's biography of Calvin, he states, :\\"... Jerome Bolsec, with whom Calvin crossed swords in 1551... published his Vie de Calvin at Lyons in June 1577. Calvin, according to Bolsec, was irredeemably tedious and malicious, bloodthirsty and frustrated. He treated his own words as if they were the word of God, and allowed himself to be worshipped as God. In addition to frequently falling victim to his homosexual tendencies, he had a habit of indulging himself sexually with any female within walking distance. According to Bolsec, Calvin resigned his benefices at Noyon on account of the public exposure of his homosexual activities. Bolsec's biography makes much more interesting reading than those of Theodore Beza and Nicolas Colladon; nevertheless, his work rests largely upon unsubstantiated anonymous oral reports deriving from 'trustworthy individuals' (personnes digne de foy), which modern scholarship has found of questionable merit.\\"McGrath, Alister E. (1990), A Life of John Calvin, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, pp 16-17. Thomas Henry Dyer's biography of Calvin offers the following context, :Bolsec ..affirms that the real cause of M. dc Fallals' leaving Geneva was, that Calvin had solicited the chastity of his wife ... Calvin appeared before the council of that city (Berne) on the 17th of February, 1552, for the purpose of clearing himself from certain calumnies. :No provocation can excuse Bolsec for bringing these infamous charges; yet he was probably incited by Beza's \\"Life of Calvin\\" to insert them in his own biography of Calvin. In the work alluded to, Beza charges Bolsec, after he had returned to the Roman Catholic communion, with prostituting his wife to the canons of Autun ; an imputation, the truth of which is liable to considerable suspicion, from the virulence displayed by Beza in persecuting Bolsec, and from the fact that that writer, and even Calvin himself, were not always very scrupulous in ascertaining the truth of what they alleged against their adversaries. It is certain that Beza's \\"Life of Calvin\\" appeared before Bolsec's, which was not published till many years after Calvin's death.

Boeing Library The Boeing Library is a library based at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre. The library started in the 1960s and served as a small reading room for the staff of the SDSC, which was then a research centre only. With the assistance of an annual grant by Boeing Australia the library expanded in the late 1980s to include an extensive range of books and journals on defence policy and planning, military studies and regional security issues. The Boeing Library is important to the academic and research staff at the centre as well as at the ANU. Its holdings cover the following fields: Australian defence policy and planning, military studies, classical theorists on the causes and conduct of war, the laws of armed conflict, ethics and nuclear issues (like proliferation and arms control). The library keeps important collections on the United Nations and peacekeeping, and the politics, society and foreign and defence policies of the countries in the Asia-Pacific. It continues to subscribe to major strategic and defence journals which are not part of the main University library collection. So far, the Boeing Library is not a borrowing library, but is open to the public for 'in-house' use during weekdays.

Its goal was to give Danbury, Connecticut, a rail link with the outside world. It became the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad by 1850 which in turn did not operate until 1852. This company preceded Danbury and Norwalk Railroad and by 1950 ceased to exist. Prior to the railroad era routes from Danbury to Norwalk were opened along at least two toll roads. In October 1795 the Danbury and Norwalk Turnpike was opened (which mostly followed present day Route 53) and then in May 1801 the Danbury-Ridgefield Turnpike was opened (it followed the present day U.S. Route 7 and Connecticut Route 35).List of turnpikes in Connecticut The turnpikes provided only limited capacity freight and passenger transportation. One alternative to the turnpikes, a canal, was considered. In 1830, a survey was conducted for a potential canal from the Still River near Danbury to the Saugatuck River to take boats from Danbury to Westport, but a 400-foot drop along the canal route would have required a number of locks, which made the idea too expensive, and a canal would not improve transit time.Cornwall, L. Peter, \\"The Danbury & Norwalk Railroad and its impact on Cannondale\\", pp 105-132, published in Cannondale: A Connecticut Neighborhood (no overall editor named), published by the Wilton Historical Society, 1987 The Fairfield County Railroad was formed by Danbury leaders to provide better transportation in a charter granted by the Connecticut General Assembly in 1835, and the company was chartered in May. Instead of steam locomotives, the original idea was to have horses pull cars along the tracks, which would have been an improvement on the unpaved toll roads. At first a route was sought towards Long Island Sound. Professor Alexander C. Twining of Yale University surveyed a route to follow the Saugatuck River to a spot near Compo Point in Westport and another route to a spot near Wilson's Point in South Norwalk. Steamboat landings were envisioned at each spot for connections to New York City. Next a line north along the Housatonic River was surveyed. This would bring in the much needed money for the railroad. Due to lack of financing the railroad was not built at first. The Housatonic Railroad offered to connect Danbury if the town would subscribe for a bond of $100.000 in said company. Danbury declined. The Housatonic built northwards along the route that the Fairfield County Railroad had surveyed. The Housatonic started service between Bridgeport and New Milford by February 1840.Housatonic Railroad The Fairfield County Railroad would now only be limited to build south towards Long Island Sound. In 1850 the Charter was renewed, and the company was renamed the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad which started operation in 1852. The line would eventually be known as the Danbury Branch of several successor railroads. The Norwalk route was chosen over the Westport route for engineering reasons, not because the railroad expected to make money from servicing the communities along the way. Before the railroad was built, an estimate for revenues projected $30,000 in annual income from Danbury but only $2,000 from all the intermediate towns combined.

The revolt  Unlike his brother, Muhammad al- Baqir, the fifth Imam of the Twelver Shi'as, Zayd ibn Ali believed the time was ripe for renewing the rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphs in support of the claims of his own Hashemite clan. On his trip to Iraq, he was persuaded by pro-Alids of Kufa that he had support of 10,000 warriors and could easily drive out a few hundred Umayyad soldiers stationed there. Kufa had previously been the capital of his great-grandfather Ali, and the place where his grandfather Husayn also sought support for his own rebellion in 680. He started his propaganda in Kufa, Basra and Mosul and 15,000 people were enlisted on his army register. The Umayyad governor of Kufa, however, learned of the plot, and commanded the people to gather at the great mosque, locked them inside and began a search for Zayd. Zayd with some troops fought his way to the mosque and called on people to come out. However, in events that echoed Husayn's own abandonment by the Kufans decades earlier, the bulk of Zayd's supporters deserted him and joined the Umayyads, leaving Zayd with only a few dozen outnumbered followers. Accounts differ slightly on the circumstances of the desertion. Sunni sources attribute the desertion to Zayd's refusal to speak ill of the first two Caliphs, Abu Bakr and Umar, who most Shi'a don't follow and instead force their own point of view opposing their own Imams. Zaydi sources on the other hand attribute it to Zayd's refusal to acknowledge the authority of his nephew, Ja'far al-Sadiq (the sixth Imam according to the Twelver Shi'ites). In both accounts, Zayd bitterly scolds the \\"rejectors\\" (RƒÅfi·∏çah) who desert him, an appellation used by some Sunnis to describe non- Zaydi Shi'ites to this day. Twelver Shia sources such as al-Kashi's al-Rijal state the opposite, that Zayd called the rejectors Batriyyah as they apparently refused to speak ill of the two caliphs. It was said they cut (Batri) the origin of the cause of Zayd's uprising. Zaydi hadith sources however do not discuss the issue of speaking ill of the two caliphs. Instead they simply state that Zayd named them Rejectors due to them not being willing to launch an uprising against the Umayyad government. It is likely that the Sunni and Shia narrations which concern speaking ill of the caliphs are a result of sectarian tensions like much of the hadith literature. Nevertheless, Zayd fought on. His small band of followers was soundly defeated by the much larger Umayyad force, and Zayd fell in battle to an arrow that pierced his forehead. The arrow's removal led to his death. He was buried in secret outside Kufa, but the Umayyads were able to find the burial place, and, in retribution for the rebellion, exhumed Zayd's body and crucified it. The corpse remained on the cross for three years. After the death of Hisham, the new caliph ordered his corpse to be burned. The ashes were scattered in the Euphrates. When the Abbasids, who, like Zayd, were Hashemites, overthrew the Umayyads in 750, they in turn exhumed Hisham's body, crucified it, and burned it, out of revenge for Zayd.  Consequences Zayd's desperate rebellion became the inspiration for the Zaydi sect, a school of Shi'a Islam that holds that any learned descendant of Ali can become an Imam by asserting and fighting for his claim as Zayd did (the rest of the Shi'as believe, in contrast, that the Imam must be divinely appointed). However, all schools of Islam, including the majority Sunnis, regard Zayd as a righteous martyr (shahid) against what is regarded as the corrupt leadership of the Umayyads. It is even reported that Abu Hanifa, founder of the largest school of Sunni jurisprudence, gave financial support to Zayd's revolt and called on others to join Zayd's rebellion. Zayd's rebellion inspired other revolts by members of his clan, especially in the Hejaz, the most famous among these being the revolt of Muhammad al-Nafs az-Zakiyya against the Abbasids in 762. Zaydi agitation continued until 785 and re-erupted in Tabaristan under the leadership of the Zayd's son, Hasan ibn Zayd ibn Ali His revolt attracted many supporters, among them the ruler of Rustamids, the son of Farƒ´d≈´n (a descendant of Rostam FarrokhzƒÅd), Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rustam.

Protestants in India are a small minority in a predominantly Hindu country, but form majorities in the north-eastern states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and sizeable minorities in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and various east coast and northern states. Protestants today trace their heritage back through a rich history of Christian and monotheistic faith on the Indian subcontinent. History=Colonial India St. Paul's Cathedral was built in 1847 and served as the chair of the Bishop of Calcutta, who served as the metropolitan of the Church of India, Burma and Ceylon. As the Anglican Church was the established church of England, \\"it had an impact on India with the arrival of the British\\". Citing the Great Commission, Joseph White, a Laudian Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford, \\"preached before the university in 1784 on the duty of promoting the universal and progressive message of Christianity 'among our Mahometan and Gentoo Subjects in India'.\\" In 1889, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury expressed similar sentiments, stating that \\"It is not only our duty but is in our interest to promote the diffusion of Christianity as far as possible throughout the length and breadth of India.\\" The growth of the British Indian Army led to the arrival of many Anglican chaplains in India. Following the arrival of the Church of England's Church Mission Society in 1814, the Diocese of Calcutta of the Church of India, Burma and Ceylon (CIBC) was erected, with its St. Paul's Cathedral being built in 1847. By 1930, the Church of India, Burma and Ceylon had fourteen dioceses across the Indian Empire. Missionaries from other Christian denominations came to British India as well; Lutheran missionaries, for example, arrived in Calcutta in 1836 and by \\"the year 1880 there were over 31,200 Lutheran Christians spread out in 1,052 villages\\". Methodists began arriving in India in 1783 and established missions with a focus on \\"education, health ministry, and evangelism\\". In the 1790s, Christians from the London Missionary Society and Baptist Missionary Society, began doing missionary work in the Indian Empire. In Neyoor, the London Missionary Society Hospital \\"pioneered improvements in the public health system for the treatment of diseases even before organized attempts were made by the colonial Madras Presidency, reducing the death rate substantially\\". After 1857, the establishment of schools and hospitals by British Christian missionaries became the \\"a pivotal feature of missionary work and the principal vehicles for conversion\\". Christ Church College (1866) and St. Stephen's College (1881) are two examples of prominent church-affiliated educational institutions founded during the colonial period India. Within educational institutions established during the British Raj in India, Christian texts, especially the Bible, were a part of the curricula. During the colonial era in India, Christian missionaries developed writing systems for Indian languages that previously did not have one. Christian missionaries in India also worked to increase literacy and also engaged in social activism, such as fighting against prostitution, championing the right of widowed women to remarry, and trying to stop early marriages for women. Among British women, zenana missions became a popular method to win converts to Christianity. In colonial India, the All India Conference of Indian Christians (AICIC) played an important role in the Indian independence movement, advocating for swaraj and opposing the partition of India. The AICIC also was opposed to separate electorates for Christians, believing that the faithful \\"should participate as common citizens in one common, national political system\\". The All India Conference of Indian Christians and the All India Catholic Union formed a working committee with M. Rahnasamy of Andhra University serving as President and B.L. Rallia Ram of Lahore serving as General Secretary; in its meeting on 16 April 1947 and 17 April 1947, the joint committee prepared a 13 point memorandum that was sent to the Constituent Assembly of India, which asked for religious freedom for both organisations and individuals; this came to be reflected in the Constitution of India. Independent India Many Protestant denominations are represented in India, the result of missionary activities throughout the country especially under British rule in India. The largest Protestant denomination in the country is the Church of South India, since 1947 a union of Presbyterian, Reformed, Congregational, Methodist, and Anglican congregations with approximately 4 million members as of 2014. The broadly similar Church of North India had 1 million members. (Both churches are in full communion with the Anglican Communion.) There were about 1.3 million Lutherans, 473,000 Methodists, and 425,000 Baptists as of 1995. Pentecostalism, one of the largest Protestant denominations worldwide, is also a rapidly growing denomination in India. It is spreading greatly in northern India and the southwestern areas, such as Kerala. The largest indigenous Pentecostal denominations in India are The Pentecostal Mission (TPM) and the India Pentecostal Church of God (IPC). As for the smaller denominations, another prominent group is the Brethren. They include Plymouth Brethren, Indian Brethren, Kerala Brethren etc. The Conference of the Mennonite Brethren Churches in India has more than 100,000 members. One of the oldest denominations meanwhile is the Northern Evangelical Lutheran Church.  Notable missionaries  Protestant missionaries began to work throughout India, leading to the growth of different Christian communities. In 1793, William Carey, an English Baptist Minister, came to India as a missionary. He worked in Serampore, Calcutta and other cities founding churches. On the educational front, in addition to starting the Serampore College, he also translated the Bible into Bengali and Sanskrit, continuing with these labours until his death in 1834. According to the chronicler Otto of Freising, Arnold had studied in Paris under the tutelage of the reformer and philosopher Pierre Ab√©lard. He took to Ab√©lard's philosophy of reform ways. Anthony Norris Groves, Plymouth Brethren missionary came to India in 1833. He worked in the Godavari delta area of then Madras Presidency, until his death in 1852.

Mitterrand based this oral promise, which was upheld until the 2000s by France, on the alleged non-conformity of Italian legislation with European standards. The French president opposed aspects of the anti-terrorist laws passed in Italy during the 1970s and 1980s, which created the status of \\"collaboratore di giustizia\\" (\\"collaborators with justice\\", known commonly as pentito). This was similar to the \\"crown witness\\" legislation in the UK or the Witness Protection Program in the United States, in which people charged with crimes are allowed to become witnesses for the state and possibly to receive reduced sentences and protection. Italian legislation also provided that, if a defendant was able to conduct his defence via his lawyers, trials held in absentia did not need to be repeated if he were eventually apprehended. The Italian in absentia procedure was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The Mitterrand doctrine was effectively repealed in 2002, under the government of Jean-Pierre Raffarin during the presidency of Jacques Chirac, when Paolo Persichetti was extradited from France.  Establishment of the doctrine  Mitterrand defined his doctrine during a speech at the Palais des sports in Rennes on February 1, 1985. Mitterrand excluded still active terrorist from this protection. On 21 April 1985, at the 65th Congress of the Human Rights League (LDH), he declared that Italian criminals who had broken with their violent past and had fled to France would be protected from extradition to Italy: > \\"Italian refugees (...) who took part in terrorist action before 1981 (...) > have broken links with the infernal machine in which they participated, have > begun a second phase of their lives, have integrated into French society > (...) I told the Italian government that they were safe from any sanction by > the means of extradition\\".Les r√©fugi√©s italiens (...) qui ont particip√© √† > l'action terroriste avant 1981 (...) ont rompu avec la machine infernale > dans laquelle ils s'√©taient engag√©s, ont abord√© une deuxi√®me phase de leur > propre vie, se sont ins√©r√© dans la soci√©t√© fran√ßaise (...). J'ai dit au > gouvernement italien qu'ils √©taient √† l'abri de toute sanction par voie > d'extradition (...). This policy statement was followed by French justice when it came to the extradition of far-left Italian terrorists or activists. According to a 2007 article by the Corriere della Sera, Mitterrand was convinced by Abb√© Pierre to protect these persons.Abb√© Pierre, il frate ribelle che scelse gli emarginati , Corriere della Sera, January 23, 2007 According to Cesare Battisti's lawyers, Mitterrand had given his word in consultation with the Italian Prime Minister, fellow socialist Bettino Craxi.See DROITS ACQUIS DROITS DENIES, on Parole donn√©e  The doctrine in the 1985‚Äì2002 period  This commitment has long taken the place of general policy of extradition of activists and Italian terrorists. But it is no longer in force since the extradition of Paolo Persichetti in 2002, former member of the Red Brigades, which was approved by the Raffarin Government. The Cesare Battisti case, in particular, has provoked debate about the interpretation of doctrine Mitterrand. Opponents of the doctrine point out that what a president can say during his tenure is not a source of law, and that this doctrine therefore has no legal value. Proponents point out that it was nevertheless consistently applied till 2002, and consider that the former president had committed the Republic through his words. His supporters (intellectuals like Fred Vargas or Bernard-Henri L√©vy, organizations such as the Greens, the League of Human Rights, France Libert√©s, Attac-France, etc.) along with some personalities of the Socialist Party (PS), are opposed to non-compliance by the right in power with the Mitterrand doctrine. This aspect of French policy has been strongly criticized by the Italian Association of Victims of Terrorism (Associazione Italiana Vittime del Terrorismo ) who in 2008 expressed particular The President Jacques Chirac said he would not oppose the extradition of persons wanted by the Italian courts.  End of the doctrine  The Mitterrand doctrine was based on a supposed superiority of French law and its alleged greater adherence to European standards and principles concerning the protection of human rights. This vision entered in crisis, from a legal viewpoint, when the European Court of Human Rights finally ruled against the French procedure in absentia, often used as a touchstone to consider the Italian procedure as in fault. In a ruling, which breaks down to the root of the French institute, the ECHR decided that the so-called process of purgation in the absence ‚Äì namely the new trial following the arrest of the fugitive ‚Äì is only a mere procedural device. So the new process can not be comparable to a guarantee for the prisoner, given that in France under Article 630 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,art. 630 c.p.p.

France Following this ruling, France partly amended its default procedure by the 9 March 2004 \\"Perben II\\" Act,. untenable for European standards on human rights. The current procedure in the absence is defined as \\"par d√©faut\\" and allows for the defense by a lawyer. In 2002, France extradited Paolo Persichetti, an ex-member of the communist terrorist group Red Brigades (BR) who was teaching sociology at the university, in breach of the Mitterrand doctrine. However, in 1998, Bordeaux's appeal court had judged that Sergio Tornaghi could not be extradited to Italy, on the grounds that Italian procedure would not organise a second trial after the first trial in absentia. The extraditions in the 2000s (decade) involved not only members of the Red Brigades, but also other leftist activists who had fled to France and were being sought by Italian justice. These included Antonio Negri, who eventually chose to return to Italy and surrender to Italian authorities. In 2004, French judicial officials authorized the extradition of Cesare Battisti. In 2005 the Conseil d'√âtat confirmed the extradition, marking the end of the Mitterrand doctrine. Nonetheless Battisti had already fled to Mexico and subsequently to Brazil, where he has lived as fugitive for the following 14 years. In 2018, when Brazil revocated his protection, he fled again to Bolivia unsuccessfully seeking asylum: he was arrested and extradited to Italy to expiate his sentence of life imprisonment for four murders. Commenting on this doctrine Gilles Martinet, an old socialist intellectual and former Ambassador in Italy wrote, in the preface to a book dedicated to the Cesare Battisti case: \\"Not being able to make a revolution in our country, we continue to dream of it elsewhere. It continues to exist the need to prove ourselves that we are always on the left and that we have not departed from the ideal\\".

Biography Staphylus was born at Osnabr√ºck. His father, Ludeke Stapellage, was an official of the Bishop of Osnabr√ºck. Left an orphan at an early age he came under the care of an uncle at Danzig, then went to Lithuania and studied at Cracow, after which he studied theology and philosophy at Padua. About 1536 he went to Wittenberg, obtained the Degree of magister artium in 1541 and at Melanchthon's recommendation became a tutor in the family of the Count of Eberstein. In 1546 Duke Albert of Prussia appointed Staphylus professor of theology at the new University of K√∂nigsberg, which the duke had founded in 1544. At this time Staphylus was still under the influence of Martin Luther's opinions, as is shown by his academic disputation upon the doctrine of justification, \\"De justificationis articulo\\". However, at his installation as professor he obtained the assurance that he need not remain if the duke tolerated errors which \\"might be contrary to the Holy Scriptures and the primitiv≈ì apostolic≈ì et catholic≈ì ecclesi≈ì consensum\\". This shows that even then he regarded with suspicion the development of Protestantism. At K√∂nigsberg he had a violent theological dispute with Wilhelm Gnapheus. In 1547-48 he was the first rector elected by the university, but in 1548 he resigned his professorship, because he met with enmity, and was dissatisfied with religious conditions in Prussia. Still he continued to be one of the councillors of the duke. In 1549 he married at Breslau the daughter of John Hess, a reformer of that place. Returning to K√∂nigsberg, a new dispute broke out between him and Osiander. The dogmatic dissension, which seemed to him to make everything uncertain, drove him continually more and more to the Catholic idea of Tradition and to the demand for the authoritative exposition of the Scriptures by the Church. He expressed these views in the treatise \\"Synodus sanctorum patrum antiquorum contra nova dogmata Andre√¶ Osiandri\\", which he wrote at Danzig in 1552. A severe illness hastened his conversion, which took place at Breslau at the end of 1552. After this he first entered the service of the Bishop of Breslau, for whom he established a school at Neisse. In 1555 the Emperor Ferdinand I appointed him a member of the imperial council. At the Disputation of Worms in 1557 he opposed, as one of the Catholic collocutors, the once venerated Melanchthon. In his \\"Theologi√¶ Martini Lutheri trimembris epitome\\" (1558) he severely attacked the lack of union in Protestantism, the worship of Luther, and religious subjectivism. The treatise called forth a number of answers. In 1560 Duke Albert of Bavaria, at the request of Canisius, appointed Staphylus professor of theology at the Bavarian University of Ingolstadt after Staphylus had received the Degree of Doctor of Theology and Canon Law in virtue of a papal dispensation, as he was married. As superintendent (curator) he reformed the university. After this he took an active part in the Catholic restoration in Bavaria and Austria. He drew up several opinions on reform for the Council of Trent, as the \\"Counsel to Pius IV\\", while he declined to go to the council personally. In 1562 the pope sent him a gift of one hundred gulden, and the emperor raised him to the nobility. He died at Ingolstadt, aged 51. His learning and eloquence are frankly acknowledged by his Lutheran fellow- countryman Hermann Hamelmann. Works Diodori Siculi fragmentary ex Greco in latinum versa.

Eldredge was born in Buffalo, New York. He appears to have self-published at least two books on the local history of San Francisco, California. His two-volume history of San Francisco was reviewed as containing \\"fairly readable essays\\" that were \\"distributed somewhat capriciously between text and notes\\". The reviewer also notes that \\"the author has not by any means confined himself to the subject\\" described by the book's title. A map printed without attribution in his book The Beginnings of San Francisco in 1912 has been the center of significant controversy among San Francisco history researchers. The map, apparently created by Eldredge, shows the \\"now vanished freshwater lake\\" upon whose shores the city was supposedly founded. Later research showed that the lake was confused with another early San Francisco location, and probably never existed, except as a tidal lagoon called Mission Creek.

It is a commuter route of SR 535; the other commuter routes in Winter Garden are Colonial Drive and SR 438. The southern terminus is SR 50, and the northern terminus is SR 438, with both ends of the state road extend into unsigned portions. South of SR 50, it becomes a street called Daniels Road, forming an overpass of the Florida's Turnpike and ending at CR 535.
