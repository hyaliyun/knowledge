History Sanskrit inscription Looking down into the well The stepwell was built in 1485 by Dhai Harir, a household lady of Mahmud Begada according to the Persian inscription in the stepwell. She was the superintendent of the royal harem. Dhai Harir built a mosque and a tomb in which she was buried. The well bears two inscriptions, one in Sanskrit on the south, and one in Arabic on the north wall, of the first gallery. The Arabic writing reads: A Sanskrit inscription says that the step-well was built in December 1499 AD. It was during the reign of Mahmud Shah that Bai Harir Sultani, locally known as Dhai Harir, built the step-well. The name later corrupted into Dada Hari. It costed 3,29,000 Mahmudis ( 3 lakh) at that time. The ornate step-well has spiral staircases pieced into the sidewall of the well shaft and descending to the different platform levels. Structure thumb400pxPlan of stepwell: A. Principal well, octagonal. B. Spire staircases descending to the water surface. C. Well for irrigation. D. Inscriptions on the sides of the gallery. E. Domed porch mounted by cupolas. The upper gallery Built in sandstone in Solanki architectural style, the Dada Harir stepwell is five stories deep. It is octagonal (8-sided polygon) in plan at the top, built on intricately carved large number of pillars. Each floor is spacious enough to provide for people to congregate. It was dug deep to access ground water at that level, accounting for seasonal fluctuations in water level due to rainfall over the year. The air and light vents in the roofs at various floors and at the landing level are in the form of large openings. From the first story level, three staircases lead to the bottom water level of the well, which is considered a unique feature. At the level of the ground, it is 190 feet long by forty wide. At the east end, from a domed canopy, a descent of eight steps leads to a covered gallery. A second flight of nine steps leads to another gallery, and a third of eight steps to the lowest gallery two or three foot above the level of the water. At each landing a corridor runs along the sides and leads to other galleries that cross the well at intervals. Built along an east‚Äìwest axis, entrance is from the East, the two spiral staircases are in West, near the well. The structural system is typically Indian style with traditional trabeat with horizontal beams and lintels. At the bottom of the well is a square stepped floor in the shape of a funnel extending to the lowest plane. This is chiseled into a circular well. Above the square floor, columns, beams, wall and arched openings spiral around; a feature that continues to the top. The top part of the well, however, is a vertical space open to the sky. The four corners of the square are strengthened with stone beams, set at 45 degrees angle. The motifs of flowers and graphics of Islamic architecture blend very well with the symbols of Hindu and Jain gods carved at various levels of the well. The dominant carvings on the upper floors are of elephants ( in size, each of different design). Gallery Dada Harir Stepwell - 6.jpgLooking up from the lowest level of the step well.

He is 42 years old, lives with his barber brother Young-il and Young-il's family, and has never been in love. Tae-il does well at his job and doesn't seem to harbor many scruples about it, but then he meets Ho-jung, a bank clerk who is taking care of her debt-ridden, terminally ill father. During their first encounter, Tae- il forces her to sign a contract that requires her to sell her organs if she can't pay back her father's debt on time. After their not-so-pleasant first meeting, however, Tae-il finds himself thinking about Ho-jung constantly and his conscience begins to get the better of him. He writes a new contract and offers it to her: He will exempt her from the debt if she goes on date with him. The more dates she goes on, the less debt she will have to pay off. Ho- jung rejects his offer at first, but knowing that she is unable to make the payments at any cost, she reluctantly agrees.

San Diego, 824 F.3d 919 (9th Cir. 2016), was a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit pertaining to the legality of San Diego County's restrictive policy regarding requiring documentation of \\"good cause\\" that \\"distinguish[es] the applicant from the mainstream and places the applicant in harm's way\\" (Cal. Pen. Code ¬ß¬ß 26150, 26155) before issuing a concealed carry permit. After an initial ruling (2-1) in 2014 that held that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protected the right to carry a concealed weapon, the court reheard the case en banc, ultimately reversing the lower court ruling, saying that \\"there is no Second Amendment right for members of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public.\\" While the ruling technically applied to all states and territories under the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit, it only applied to California and Hawaii in practice because the remaining states in the Ninth Circuit's area of responsibility have either Shall-Issue licensing policies or allow concealed carry without a permit. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which in June 2017 denied the writ of certiorari, leaving the Ninth Circuit's en banc opinion in place. Reasoning The court reviewed the history of gun control cases in which laws forbidding the concealed carry of weapons were involved. They covered a time period from 1299 (in England) to the late 1800s US Supreme Court. The majority opinion was that there was an \\"overwhelming consensus\\" of historical case decisions establishing that there was never a time in history when courts believed that states could not prohibit concealed carry. Consequently, they concluded it could not be a violation of the long-standing interpretation of the Second Amendment. The minority argued that a prohibition on concealed carry for the general public, accompanied by a similar prohibition on open carry, was a de facto gun ban, and therefore is unconstitutional under District of Columbia v. Heller. Details Under San Diego's policy, a typical citizen in San Diego County cannot bear arms in public for self-defense because by San Diego's definition, typical citizens cannot distinguish [themselves] from the mainstream and receive concealed carry permits(Peruta v. San Diego (9th Cir, 02-13-14) p. 54.). Although prior to January 1, 2012, it was legal to openly carry an unloaded handgun in public, in October 2011 Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that modifies the law on openly carrying an unloaded firearm to match the restrictions for openly carrying a loaded weapon,McGreevy, Patrick and Riccardi, Nicholas (October 10, 2011). \\"Brown Bans Open Carrying of Handguns\\", Los Angeles Times. Retrieved December 9, 2011. effectively prohibiting (in all but limited circumstances) the open carry of firearms whether loaded or unloaded. (Cal. Pen. Code ¬ß¬ß 25850, 26155.) Thus, the court found San Diego County's restrictive policy in combination with California's denial of open carry ultimately resulted in the destruction of the typical law-abiding, responsible citizen's right to bear arms in any manner in public, thereby violating the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. History The February 13, 2014 decision is written by Diarmuid O'Scannlain, with Consuelo Mar√≠a Callahan joining and Sidney Runyan Thomas dissenting, and affirmed the right of responsible, law-abiding citizens to carry a handgun in public for lawful self-defense. The primary plaintiff, Edward Peruta, was represented by attorneys Paul Neuharth, Jr. from San Diego and Chuck Michel from Long Beach. On February 27, 2014 California Attorney General Kamala Harris filed a petition for en banc review of the decision. As the state was not a formal party of the case, her action is not an appeal, but merely a request that the full court re-hear the case en-banc on its own initiative (sua sponte). The court denied Harris' petition on November 12, 2014. On December 3, 2014, the Ninth Circuit announced that a judge on the circuit made a sua sponte call for a vote on whether the case should be reheard en banc. The court gave the parties, and any Amici curiae, 21 days to file briefs setting forth their positions whether the case should be reheard en banc. On March 26, 2015, the Ninth Circuit announced that they would hear the case, along with Richards v. Prieto, en banc, including setting aside the original rulings in the cases and stating that they were not to be used as case law. The cases were argued on June 16, 2015. On June 9, 2016, the en banc court reversed the lower court ruling, saying that \\"there is no Second Amendment right for members of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public.\\" The en banc ruling did not address the constitutionality of restrictions on open carry, leaving that matter open to potential future litigation. On June 23, 2016, the plaintiff-appellants petitioned the Ninth Circuit for a full-court re-hearing. On August 15, 2016, the Ninth Circuit denied the petition for a full-court en banc rehearing. On January 12, 2017 the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. On June 26, 2017 the Supreme Court denied the writ, with Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Gorsuch, dissenting: > We should have granted certiorari in this case. The approach taken by the en > banc court is indefensible, and the petition raises important questions that > this Court should address. I see no reason to await another case. ... [T]he > Second Amendment's core purpose further supports this conclusion that the > right to bear arms extends to public carry. The Court in Heller emphasized > that \\"self-defense\\" is \\"the central component of the [Second Amendment] > right itself.\\" ... The Court's decision to deny certiorari in this case > reflects a distressing trend: the treatment of the Second Amendment as a > disfavored right. ... I do not think we should stand by idly while a State > denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may > depend on it. I respectfully dissent. Reactions The San Diego County Sheriff's Department issued a press release on February 21, 2014 stating it will not seek review of the decision by the entire membership of judges sitting in the Ninth Circuit, and that, \\"Should the decision of the Ninth Circuit become final, the Sheriff's Department will begin to issue CCW's in situations where the applicant has met all other lawful qualifications and has requested a CCW for purposes of self-defense.\\" As a result of the court's original decision in 2014, the Orange County Sheriff's Department has loosened requirements for obtaining a concealed carry permit. Instead of requiring the applicant to have \\"good cause,\\" the applicant need only to assert that a permit is needed for self-defense or personal safety. Related cases=Scocca v. Smith Scocca v. Smith ‚Äì In 2008, Tom Scocca, a former law enforcement officer, applied for a concealed-carry permit from Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith, and was denied because he could not show \\"good cause.\\" Scocca sued Smith, and the case was put on hold pending decisions in San Diego and Yolo County cases, and has since been dismissed. Richards v. Prieto In addition to Peruta, the same judges heard the Richards v. Prieto case at the same time, which challenged the handgun carry license policy of Yolo County Sheriff Ed Prieto. The case originally was entitled Sykes v. McGinness and included Sacramento County's then-sheriff, John McGinness, as a defendant. Sacramento County changed its licensing policy during the lawsuit, and the complaint against McGinness was dismissed. After ruling on Peruta, the Ninth Circuit judges unanimously ruled in Richards: > In light of our holding in [Peruta] we conclude that the district court in > this case erred in ruling Richard[s'] motion for summary judgment because > the Yolo County policy impermissibly infringes on the Second Amendment right > to bear arms in lawful self-defense. Baker v. Kealoha In addition to Peruta, the same judges heard the Baker v. Kealoha case at the same time, which challenged the handgun carry law in Hawaii. After ruling on Peruta, the Ninth Circuit judges in a 2-1 vote ruled in Baker: > In light of our disposition of the same issue in [Peruta] we conclude that > the district court made an error of law when it concluded the Hawaii > statutes at issue did not implicate protected conduct.

This oyster can be found in shallow water along the tropical and subtropical Pacific coast of America, its range including Baja California, Mexico and northern Peru. History Fragments of shell ornaments made from the nacre of the Pacific wing-oyster have been found at ancient burial sites in Mexico, probably belonging to the indigenous Seri people of the Sonora region. This oyster has been the subject of a pearl fishery in the Gulf of California since before the arrival of Hernan Cortez in 1535; the Spaniards quickly appreciated the value of the harvest and in 1586 they declared the gathering of oysters to be a right of the Spanish crown. In 1874, compressed air diving equipment made harvesting the oysters easier. Over-exploitation caused populations of the oyster to become depleted and in 1940 the fishery was closed by the Mexican Government, a ban that still remains in force. Distribution Pteria sterna is found in shallow water along the tropical and subtropical Pacific coast of America. Its range includes Baja California, Mexico and the Talara Province of northern Peru where its depth range is . Pearl culture The Pacific wing-oyster naturally produces gray, pink, golden, green and purplish pearls. With the dwindling of the number of wild oysters, efforts to farm this species on a commercial scale to produce pearls have been made. The production of cultured pearls requires the grafting of a pearl nucleus, together with a portion of mantle tissue from a donor into a recipient oyster. The culture of round pearls in Pacific wing- oysters is technically hard; the oysters are small and the shells are thin, the shape of the shell makes the seeding operation difficult and the pearl sack is wide at the base which means that the graft may shift around. With experience, technicians gain expertise in seeding and yields can be high, with pearls reaching a maximum of in diameter.

It utilizes a biclique structure to extend the number of possibly attacked rounds by the MITM attack. Since biclique cryptanalysis is based on MITM attacks, it is applicable to both block ciphers and (iterated) hash-functions. Biclique attacks are known for having broken both full AES and full IDEA, though only with slight advantage over brute force. It has also been applied to the KASUMI cipher and preimage resistance of the Skein-512 and SHA-2 hash functions.Bicliques for Preimages: Attacks on Skein-512 and the SHA-2 family The biclique attack is still () the best publicly known single- key attack on AES. The computational complexity of the attack is 2^{126.1}, 2^{189.7} and 2^{254.4} for AES128, AES192 and AES256, respectively. It is the only publicly known single-key attack on AES that attacks the full number of rounds. Previous attacks have attacked round reduced variants (typically variants reduced to 7 or 8 rounds). As the computational complexity of the attack is 2^{126.1}, it is a theoretical attack, which means the security of AES has not been broken, and the use of AES remains relatively secure. The biclique attack is nevertheless an interesting attack, which suggests a new approach to performing cryptanalysis on block ciphers. The attack has also rendered more information about AES, as it has brought into question the safety-margin in the number of rounds used therein.  History  The original MITM attack was first suggested by Diffie and Hellman in 1977, when they discussed the cryptanalytic properties of DES. They argued that the key-size was too small, and that reapplying DES multiple times with different keys could be a solution to the key-size; however, they advised against using double-DES and suggested triple-DES as a minimum, due to MITM attacks (MITM attacks can easily be applied to double-DES to reduce the security from 2^{56*2} to just 2*2^{56}, since one can independently bruteforce the first and the second DES-encryption if they have the plain- and ciphertext). Since Diffie and Hellman suggested MITM attacks, many variations have emerged that are useful in situations, where the basic MITM attack is inapplicable. The biclique attack variant was first suggested by Dmitry Khovratovich, Rechberger and Savelieva for use with hash-function cryptanalysis. However, it was Bogdanov, Khovratovich and Rechberger who showed how to apply the concept of bicliques to the secret-key setting including block-cipher cryptanalysis, when they published their attack on AES. Prior to this, MITM attacks on AES and many other block ciphers had received little attention, mostly due to the need for independent key bits between the two 'MITM subciphers' in order to facilitate the MITM attack ‚Äî something that is hard to achieve with many modern key schedules, such as that of AES.  The biclique  For a general explanation of what a biclique structure is, see the article for bicliques. In a MITM attack, the keybits K_1 and K_2, belonging to the first and second subcipher, need to be independent; that is, they need to be independent of each other, else the matched intermediate values for the plain- and ciphertext cannot be computed independently in the MITM attack (there are variants of MITM attacks, where the blocks can have shared key-bits. See the 3-subset MITM attack). This property is often hard to exploit over a larger number of rounds, due to the diffusion of the attacked cipher. Simply put: The more rounds you attack, the larger subciphers you will have. The larger subciphers you have, the fewer independent key-bits between the subciphers you will have to bruteforce independently. Of course, the actual number of independent key-bits in each subcipher depends on the diffusion properties of the key-schedule. The way the biclique helps with tackling the above, is that it allows one to, for instance, attack 7 rounds of AES using MITM attacks, and then by utilizing a biclique structure of length 3 (i.e. it covers 3 rounds of the cipher), you can map the intermediate state at the start of round 7 to the end of the last round, e.g. 10 (if it is AES128), thus attacking the full number of rounds of the cipher, even if it was not possible to attack that amount of rounds with a basic MITM attack. The meaning of the biclique is thus to build a structure effectively, which can map an intermediate value at the end of the MITM attack to the ciphertext at the end. Which ciphertext the intermediate state gets mapped to at the end, of course depends on the key used for the encryption. The key used to map the state to the ciphertext in the biclique, is based on the keybits bruteforced in the first and second subcipher of the MITM attack. The essence of biclique attacks is thus, besides the MITM attack, to be able to build a biclique structure effectively, that depending on the keybits K_1 and K_2 can map a certain intermediate state to the corresponding ciphertext.  How to build the biclique = Bruteforce  Get 2^d intermediate states and 2^d ciphertexts, then compute the keys that maps between them. This requires 2^{2d} key-recoveries, since each intermediate state needs to be linked to all ciphertexts.  Independent related-key differentials  (This method was suggested by Bogdanov, Khovratovich and Rechberger in their paper: Biclique Cryptanalysis of the Full AES) Preliminary: Remember that the function of the biclique is to map the intermediate values, S, to the ciphertext-values, C, based on the key K[i,j] such that: \\\\forall i,j : S_j \\\\xrightarrow[f]{K[i,j]}C_i Procedure: _Step one:_ An intermediate state(S_0), a ciphertext(C_0) and a key(K[0,0]) is chosen such that: S_0\\\\xrightarrow[f]{K[0,0]}C_o, where f is the function that maps an intermediate state to a ciphertext using a given key. This is denoted as the base computation. _Step two:_ Two sets of related keys of size 2^d is chosen. The keys are chosen such that: * The first set of keys are keys, which fulfills the following differential-requirements over f with respect to the base computation: 0\\\\xrightarrow[f]{\\\\Delta^K_i}\\\\Delta_i * The second set of keys are keys, which fulfills the following differential-requirements over f with respect to the base computation: abla_j \\\\xrightarrow[f]{ abla^K_j}0 * The keys are chosen such that the trails of the \\\\Delta_i\\\\- and abla_j- differentials are independent ‚Äì i.e. they do not share any active non-linear components. In other words: An input difference of 0 should map to an output difference of \\\\Delta_i under a key difference of \\\\Delta^K_i. All differences are in respect to the base computation. An input difference of abla_j should map to an output difference of 0 under a key difference of abla^K_J. All differences are in respect to the base computation. _Step three:_ Since the trails do not share any non-linear components (such as S-boxes), the trails can be combined to get: 0\\\\xrightarrow[f]{\\\\Delta^K_i}\\\\Delta_i \\\\oplus abla_j \\\\xrightarrow[f]{ abla^K_j}0 = abla_j \\\\xrightarrow[f]{\\\\Delta^K_i \\\\oplus abla^K_j}\\\\Delta_i, which conforms to the definitions of both the differentials from step 2. It is trivial to see that the tuple (S_0, C_0, K[0,0]) from the base computation, also conforms by definition to both the differentials, as the differentials are in respect to the base computation. Substituting S_0, C_0 K[0,0] into any of the two definitions, will yield 0\\\\xrightarrow[f]{0}0 since \\\\Delta_0 = 0, abla_0 = 0 and \\\\Delta^K_0 = 0. This means that the tuple of the base computation, can also be XOR'ed to the combined trails: S_0 \\\\oplus abla_j \\\\xrightarrow[f]{K[0,0] \\\\oplus \\\\Delta^K_i \\\\oplus abla^K_j}C_0 \\\\oplus \\\\Delta_i _Step four:_ It is trivial to see that: S_j = S_0 \\\\oplus abla_j K[i,j] = K[0,0] \\\\oplus \\\\Delta^K_i \\\\oplus abla^K_j C_i = C_0 \\\\oplus \\\\Delta_i If this is substituted into the above combined differential trails, the result will be: S_j \\\\xrightarrow[f]{K[i,j]}C_i Which is the same as the definition, there was earlier had above for a biclique: \\\\forall i,j : S_j \\\\xrightarrow[f]{K[i,j]}C_i It is thus possible to create a biclique of size 2^{2d} (2^{2d} since all 2^d keys of the first set of keys, can be combined with the 2^d keys from the second set of keys). This means a biclique of size 2^{2d} can be created using only 2*2^d computations of the differentials \\\\Delta_i and abla_j over f. If \\\\Delta_i eq abla_j for i+j>0 then all of the keys K[i,j] will also be different in the biclique. This way is how the biclique is constructed in the leading biclique attack on AES. There are some practical limitations in constructing bicliques with this technique. The longer the biclique is, the more rounds the differential trails has to cover. The diffusion properties of the cipher, thus plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of constructing the biclique.  Other ways of constructing the biclique  Bogdanov, Khovratovich and Rechberger also describe another way to construct the biclique, called 'Interleaving Related- Key Differential Trails' in the article: \\"Biclique Cryptanalysis of the Full AES\\".  Biclique Cryptanalysis procedure  _Step one:_ The attacker groups all possible keys into key-subsets of size 2^{2d} for some d, where the key in a group is indexed as K[i,j] in a matrix of size 2^d \\\\times 2^d. The attacker splits the cipher into two sub-ciphers, f and g (such that E = f \\\\circ g), as in a normal MITM attack. The set of keys for each of the sub-ciphers is of cardinality 2^d, and is called K[i,0] and K[0,j]. The combined key of the sub- ciphers is expressed with the aforementioned matrix K[i, j]. _Step two:_ The attacker builds a biclique for each group of 2^{2d} keys. The biclique is of dimension-d, since it maps 2^d internal states, S_j, to 2^d ciphertexts, C_i, using 2^{2d} keys. The section \\"How to build the biclique\\" suggests how to build the biclique using \\"Independent related-key differentials\\". The biclique is in that case built using the differentials of the set of keys, K[i,0] and K[0,j], belonging to the sub-ciphers. _Step three:_ The attacker takes the 2^d possible ciphertexts, C_i, and asks a decryption-oracle to provide the matching plaintexts, P_i. _Step four:_ The attacker chooses an internal state, S_j and the corresponding plaintext, P_i, and performs the usual MITM attack over f and g by attacking from the internal state and the plaintext. _Step five:_ Whenever a key-candidate is found that matches S_j with P_i, that key is tested on another plain-/ciphertext pair. if the key validates on the other pair, it is highly likely that it is the correct key.  Example attack  The following example is based on the biclique attack on AES from the paper \\"Biclique Cryptanalysis of the Full AES\\". The descriptions in the example uses the same terminology that the authors of the attack used (i.e. for variable names, etc). For simplicity it is the attack on the AES128 variant that is covered below. The attack consists of a 7-round MITM attack with the biclique covering the last 3 rounds.  Key partitioning  The key-space is partitioned into 2^{112} groups of keys, where each group consist of 2^{16} keys. For each of the 2^{112} groups, a unique base-key K[0,0] for the base- computation is selected. The base-key has two specific bytes set to zero, shown in the below table (which represents the key the same way AES does in a 4x4 matrix for AES128): :: \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\- & \\\\- & \\\\- & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\- & \\\\- & \\\\- \\\\ \\\\- & \\\\- & \\\\- & \\\\- \\\\ \\\\- & \\\\- & \\\\- & \\\\- \\\\end{bmatrix} The remaining 14 bytes (112 bits) of the key is then enumerated. This yields 2^{112} unique base-keys; one for each group of keys. The ordinary 2^{16} keys in each group is then chosen with respect to their base-key. They are chosen such that they are nearly identical to the base-key. They only vary in 2 bytes (either the i's or the j's) of the below shown 4 bytes: :: \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\- & \\\\- & i & i \\\\ j & \\\\- & j & \\\\- \\\\ \\\\- & \\\\- & \\\\- & \\\\- \\\\ \\\\- & \\\\- & \\\\- & \\\\- \\\\end{bmatrix} This gives 2^8 K[i,0] and 2^8 K[0,j], which combined gives 2^{16} different keys, K[i,j]. these 2^{16} keys constitute the keys in the group for a respective base key.  Biclique construction  2^{112} bicliques is constructed using the \\"Independent related-key differentials\\" technique, as described in the \\"How to construct the biclique\\" section. The requirement for using that technique, was that the forward- and backward- differential trails that need to be combined, did not share any active non- linear elements. How is it known that this is the case? Due to the way the keys in step 1 is chosen in relation to the base key, the differential trails \\\\Delta_i using the keys K[i,0] never share any active S-boxes (which is the only non-linear component in AES), with the differential trails abla_j using the key K[0,j]. It is therefore possible to XOR the differential trails and create the biclique.  MITM attack  When the bicliques are created, the MITM attack can almost begin. Before doing the MITM attack, the 2^d intermediate values from the plaintext: P_i\\\\xrightarrow[]{K[i,0]}\\\\xrightarrow[v_i]{}, the 2^d intermediate values from the ciphertext: \\\\xleftarrow[v_j]{}\\\\xleftarrow[]{K[0,j]}S_j, and the corresponding intermediate states and sub-keys K[i,0] or K[0,j], are precomputed and stored, however. Now the MITM attack can be carried out. In order to test a key K[i,j], it is only necessary to recalculate the parts of the cipher, which is known will vary between P_i\\\\xrightarrow[]{K[i,0]}\\\\xrightarrow[v_i]{} and P_i\\\\xrightarrow[]{K[i,j]}\\\\xrightarrow[v_i]{}. For the backward computation from S_j to \\\\xleftarrow[v_j]{}, this is 4 S-boxes that needs to be recomputed. For the forwards computation from P_i to \\\\xrightarrow[v_i]{}, it is just 3 (an in-depth explanation for the amount of needed recalculation can be found in \\"Biclique Cryptanalysis of the full AES\\" paper, where this example is taken from). When the intermediate values match, a key-candidate K[i,j] between P_i and S_j is found. The key-candidate is then tested on another plain-/ciphertext pair.  Results  This attack lowers the computational complexity of AES128 to 2^{126.18}, which is 3‚Äì5 times faster than a bruteforce approach. The data complexity of the attack is 2^{88} and the memory complexity is 2^8.

Initially founded in 2009, the band didn't release material or push social media sites until 2010 at which point their lineup was solidified. Since inception, Count to Four recorded and self- released three EPs and a full-length studio album from the beginning of 2010 to the end of 2013. They've shared the stage with reputable acts such as The Dangerous Summer, Rufio, Man Overboard, and also received a major endorsement from frontman Alex Gaskarth of All Time Low. Currently the band is unsigned but under Kolossal Management with booking and PR teams. History=Formation and the Self Titled EP (Late 2009- early 2010) The band formed when singer Mike Hayden and drummer Pete Adams started playing songs together. They both realized they had an affinity for pop punk music, namely Fall Out Boy. They soon after brought in bassist Paul Porado and began writing material. In late 2009 the band brought guitarist Jay Miller in and recorded a self-titled EP at Old Soul Studios. The EP was released on Myspace and Bandcamp for free downloads, before ultimately being taken down by the band. The band currently claims that they are mainly influenced by the bands Fall Out Boy, Rufio, Jimmy Eat World, August Burns Red and blink-182. Know Where You Come From (early 2010 - early 2011) April 2010 the band recorded their second EP at 37 Studios with Producer / Engineer Matt Dalton The band also mutually parted ways bassist Paul Porado and brought in new bass guitarist Vini Stamto. The EP provided what the song \\"Growing Up and Growing Beards\\" as well as a crowd favorite \\"We Don't Have Good Days Anymore,\\" both songs of which are still found in the band's live set. The EP also contained the ballad \\"No It's A Pattern,\\" its title being a clever answer to the previous EP's track 3 question - (see Discography section). The band saw some mild success from the album, landing some showcases with larger national acts, and selling nearly 2000 digital downloads via Bandcamp. They were also featured on a few smaller blog sites, such as Tumblr blog \\"Fuck Yeah Pop Punk\\" and DyingScene.com Acoustic EP (2011‚Äì2013) Right before going back into the studio to record their first full-length album, in October 2011 the band again mutually parted ways with their 2nd bass player. Meanwhile, the band self- recorded and surprise released a 4 track acoustic record. The EP contained an acoustic version of \\"Growing Up and Growing Beards\\" previously released off of Know Where You Come From. It also contained two previously unreleased tracks, \\"Tear It Apart (Acoustic)\\" and \\"Beamquake.\\" They also added an acoustic rendition of the \\"Pok√©mon Theme Song\\" made popular by the Pok√©mon TV Series. The band even went as far as creating a Pok√©mon themed teeshirt, and often discussed their love for the video games in interviews, hence why they covered the song Aside from this song receiving some viral traction due to the popularity of the franchise, the Acoustic EP was an album seemed to be brushed under the rug, as it did not receive much press attention and was given away as a free download. Between Two Cities (2013 - present) Almost immediately after releasing their acoustic record, Count to Four returned to 37 Studios to work again with Matt Dalton on their first full-length record they titled \\"Between Two Cities.\\" Although recorded in November 2011, the album wasn't released until April 2013. The band attributed the long delay to \\"road blocks\\" in post-recording and a \\"rigorous touring schedule\\" as they toured for almost the whole of 2012. The band often talk in interviews about the concept behind the album title and how it tied into the album art and lyrical content. The entire album conceptually is a struggle between who a person was and who they are trying to be - torn between two stages of your life. The \\"two cities\\" also for the band represent NY and Philadelphia, due to that half of their members were living in each city while they were recording the album. =Prior To Release= In late February 2013 the band announced the release of the long-awaited and anticipated record, and released a new track \\"I Hope Not\\" for streaming via Bandcamp. Several weeks before the record's release, the band premiered another new song and their first ever music video for the song \\"Lavender Town\\". A week before release another new song titled \\"Bottles and Books\\" was released via a lyric video on MTV Buzzworthy The success of the music video secured the band's first international physical distribution of their album in a small record shop in Japan. =After Release= Between Two Cities is Count to Four's best selling release to date. Critics gave the album positive reviews in its first week of release. PR giants Property of Zack claimed the album to be \\"quintessential pop-punk at its finest\\" while MTV claimed the \\"throwback vibe was uniquely refreshing.\\" The album topped the Bandcamp punk charts at #1 and secured a slot on the Bandcamp the overall best sellers at #3 in its first week of release. It is still in the top 10 most artist recommend punk albums on Bandcamp. After releasing another lyric video for the song \\"Get To It,\\" Count to Four released a compilation of video track-by-track commentaries through 10 different sites over 10 days (1 site per song). They then followed up with a national tour deemed the \\"Aint No Country Wide Enough\\" tour. Shortly after returning home from tour, they went on to film another music video in late 2013 for their second single and opening track \\"I Hope Not.\\" The video was picked up by MTV producers and placed in rotation on MTVU. The band also earned the runner up position for the fan voted mtvU Freshman award. Indie Go Go Campaign and Name Change Count to Four planned made plans to tour and release another album after singer Mike Hayden departed the band to pursue grad school. They ran an IndieGoGo Campaign to help raise money for a new album and successfully raised over $15,000. With that money, they recorded a full length with producer Taylor Larson without a singer. They ran open vocal tryouts with the aid of Spencer Sotello of Periphery. Through the vocal tryouts, they acquired Lucas Cote, who quickly left for personal reasons.

That same month, fire support elements from the battalion deployed to Panama during Operation JUST CAUSE with the 1st Brigade Task Force (DRB-2). The brigade served as part of Task Force ATLANTIC until it re-deployed in February 1991. In April 1993, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery moved from Fort Ord, California to Fort Lewis, Washington with the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division, often called the 9th Infantry Regimental Combat Team. On 21 January 1995, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to support humanitarian operations. During deployment the battalion was separated into two teams. Team Alpha, consisting of HHS and A Battery, operated Migrant Camp G. Team Bravo, consisting of B and C Batteries, operated Migrant Camp E. The 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery re-deployed to Fort Lewis on 7 June 1995. On 16 August 1995, the battalion was relieved from assignment to the 7th Infantry Division and assigned to the 25th Infantry Division, as the direct support artillery unit to the 1st Brigade (Lancers). In 2002, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery began its transformation with the 1st Brigade while they transitioned from a \\"light\\" BCT to a \\"Stryker\\" BCT and became only the second BCT to complete the transformation at the time. In doing so, they became the Army's newest Stryker brigade combat team as the Army was in the midst of a major force restructuring and transformation. On October 15, 2004, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery was again called to duty, this time to participate in Operation Iraqi Freedom III. As a part of the Army's newest Stryker BCT, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery relieved the 1st Battalion, 37th FA assuming all security and support duties of the area surrounding Quaryyah in the Multi-National Division North's Area of Operation. The battalion officially unfurled its colors at Forward Operating Base Endurance, in northern Iraq on November 2, 2004. During their year in Iraq, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery partnered with the 3rd Battalion, Iraqi Army, and successfully began an Iraqi Army training Program. After a year of stability and security operations, the battalion cased its colors once more and returned to Fort Lewis, Washington. Almost immediately upon the 1st Brigade's return from combat, it was given orders to re-flag and subsequently did so from the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, to the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment on 6 June 2006. The 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery colors were then cased and shipped to the nation's last frontier. On 14 December 2006, the battalion's colors were once again unfurled in frigid Fort Wainwright, Alaska, as the 172 Stryker Brigade Combat Team and 4th Battalion, 11th Field Artillery re-flagged and assumed the colors of the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team and 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery. After the reset period, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery was again called to duty along with the 1st Stryker Brigade and was sent to the Iraqi Province of Diyala as a part of the Multi-National Division North and unfurled its colors in October 2008 at Forward Operating Base Warhorse. After a year-long deployment to Iraq, conducting counterinsurgency and stability and support operations the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery redeployed to Alaska and unfurled its colors at home in October 2009. In March 2011, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery was directed to Afghanistan. In May 2011, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery officially unfurled its colors at Forward Operating Base Lindsey, southeast of Kandahar, Afghanistan, in Regional Command ‚Äì South. Throughout its year in RC-South the battalion was tasked to conduct direct support artillery for 1st Brigade's counter-insurgency operations. Throughout the battalion, most all battery and platoon positions were in two gun firebase positions spread all over RC-South. The 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery redeployed to Alaska and unfurled its colors at Fort Wainwright in May 2012. Why they call it the \\"Automatic\\" Battalion: The 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery Regiment is known as the ‚ÄúAutomatic Battalion‚Äù or the ‚ÄúAutomatic Eighth.‚Äù ‚ÄúOf the eight battalions that were part of the regiment when I first joined 2-8 FA in August 1993, we are the lone battalion left (in the Department of the Army),‚Äù said 2-8th Commander, Lt. Col. Matthew Anderson. Of the 2-8th ‚ÄúAutomatic‚Äù nickname, Anderson said, ‚ÄúThe moniker goes back to the Korean War when basically everyone in the battalion manned the howitzers to fire artillery rounds to defend against a North Korean attack. So at the end of the day, the U.S. line held, and as all the North Korean prisoners of war were being moved back to the U.S. rear, they wanted to see the automatic artillery, because the rounds were being fired just that quickly,‚Äù he said.

Van der Vaart is documented from 1674 onwards in London. Here he worked in the workshop of another Dutch immigrant, Willem Wissing, who was a pupil and former collaborator of the court portrait painter Sir Peter Lely. Van der Vaart painted draperies and landscapes in the portraits of Wissing. After Wissing's death in 1687, van der Vaart continued his workshop. He collaborated on occasion with the German-born painter Johann Kerseboom. In 1713 van der Vaart sold off his collection and built a house in Covent Garden. He stopped painting and confined himself to the restoration of paintings because of his deteriorating eyesight. He died in London, a bachelor, and his nephew Arnold continued his restoration business.Horace Walpole, 'John Vander Vaart' in: Anecdotes of painting in England, 1717-1797, p. 306 Portrait of a Violin He was probably the teacher of the famous English mezzotint engraver John Smith (1652-1742).Richard Jeffree. \\"Smith, John (i).\\" Grove Art Online.

It was founded by Pete Lau and Carl Pei in December 2013. The company officially serves 34 countries and regions around the world . They have released numerous phones, amongst products. It is currently majority owned by Oppo as its only shareholder, which is a subsidiary of BBK Electronics along with Vivo and Realme. However, both OnePlus and Oppo deny OnePlus is a subsidiary and maintain they are independent companies, although OnePlus confirmed it uses Oppo's manufacturing line and shares part of the supply chain resources with Oppo. OnePlus' headquarters is in the Tairan Building (Ê≥∞ÁÑ∂Â§ßÂé¶) in Chegongmiao (ËΩ¶ÂÖ¨Â∫ô), the Futian District of Shenzhen. // Address in Chinese: \\"Âø´ÈÄíÂú∞ÂùÄÔºö‰∏≠ÂõΩÊ∑±Âú≥Â∏ÇÁ¶èÁî∞Âå∫ËΩ¶ÂÖ¨Â∫ôÊ≥∞ÁÑ∂ÂÖ´Ë∑ØÊ≥∞ÁÑ∂Â§ßÂé¶CÂ∫ß18Ê•ºÔºåÈÇÆÁºñ: 518040\\" History OnePlus was founded on 16 December 2013 by former Oppo vice-president Pete Lau and Carl Pei. According to Chinese public records, OnePlus' only institutional shareholder is Oppo Electronics. Lau denied that OnePlus was a wholly owned subsidiary of Oppo and stated that Oppo Electronics and not Oppo Mobile (the phone manufacturer) is a major investor of OnePlus and that they are \\"in talks with other investors.\\" The company's main goal was to design a smartphone that would balance high-end quality with a lower price than other phones in its class, believing that users would \\"Never Settle\\" for the lower-quality devices produced by other companies. Lau explained that \\"we will never be different just for the sake of being different. Everything done has to improve the actual user experience in day-to-day use.\\" He also showed aspirations of being the \\"Muji of the tech industry\\", emphasizing its focus on high-quality products with simplistic, user-friendly designs. Continuing Lau's association with the platform from the Oppo N1, OnePlus entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Cyanogen Inc. to base its products' Android distribution upon a variant of the popular custom ROM CyanogenMod and use its trademarks outside of China. The company unveiled its first device, the OnePlus One, on 23 April 2014 which was intended to capture market from the Google Nexus series. In December 2014, alongside the release of the OnePlus One in India exclusively through Amazon, OnePlus also announced plans to establish a presence in the country, with plans to open 25 official walk-in service centres across India. In April 2014, OnePlus hired Han Han to help market its products in mainland China. On 9 March 2014, the company expanded its operations to the European Union. On 16 December 2014, The Supreme Court of India and Delhi High Court banned the import and sale of OnePlus One phones following a lawsuit by Micromax alleging it has exclusivity for shipping phones with Cyanogen OS software in India. On 21 December 2014, the ban was lifted. The device continues to be shipped with Cyanogen OS; however, a customized version of Android specially designed by OnePlus and named OxygenOS has been released, allowing later OnePlus devices to be sold in India. OnePlus made its products available in Southeast Asia for the first time, partnering with Lazada Indonesia on 23 January 2015 and was expected to expand during that year throughout the region. In June 2016, OnePlus decided to pull out of the Indonesian market due to local regulations for imported 4G smartphones restricting sales of the OnePlus 2. At the launch event of the OnePlus 6 on 17 May 2018, OnePlus announced it would be opening five new OnePlus Experience stores in India, as well as 10 new service centres. According to market research firm Counterpoint Research, OnePlus topped the Indian premium smartphone market last year with a 33 percent share, beating Samsung Electronics with 26 percent. In the IDC survey, OnePlus ranked third in India's market with more than $500 in the first quarter of this year after Apple and Samsung Electronics. And it ranked second after China's Vivo in the 300-500-dollar market. On October 16, 2020, Carl Pei resigned as director of OnePlus.https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/thank- you.1323440/https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519785/oneplus-carl-pei- departure Advertising and marketing= Invitation system  Early phones were only available through a system whereby customers had to sign up for an invite to purchase the phone at irregular intervals. The system was claimed to be necessary for the young company to manage huge demand. OnePlus ended the invite system with the launch of OnePlus 3 on 14 June 2016. Announced via an interactive VR launch event, the OnePlus 3 initially went on sale within the VR app itself. OnePlus touted the event as the world's first VR shopping experience. The phone was made available for sale later that day in China, North America and the European Union on the OnePlus website, and in India on Amazon India.  \\"Smash the Past\\"  On 23 April 2014, OnePlus began its \\"Smash the Past\\" campaign. The promotion asked selected participants to destroy their phones on video in an effort to purchase the OnePlus One for $1 (US). Due to confusion, several videos were published by unselected users misinterpreting the promotion and destroying their phones before the promotion start date. OnePlus later revised the rules of their promotion by allowing consumers to donate their old phones. There were 140,000 entrants in the contest with 100 winners.  Ladies First Controversy  On 13 August 2014, OnePlus hosted a contest to give invites, which were hard to come by at the time, to their female forum members. Users were asked to post a photo of themselves with the OnePlus logo, images would be shared in the forum and could be \\"liked\\" by other forum members. This received major backlash for objectifying and degrading women resulting in the contest being pulled within hours.  Brand Ambassador  In May 2019, OnePlus made a deal with ‚ÄòAvengers‚Äô actor Robert Downey Jr. to endorse OnePlus 7 Pro. Before him, it was Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan who used to endorse OnePlus in India.  Customer support  The customer support at OnePlus was once the subject of strong criticism. In 2017, the company increased the number of customer service staff and set-up customer service and repair centers in Asia, Europe and the United States, greatly improving turnaround times for repairs and other issues.  OnePlus USB-C cable  After several weeks of customer complaints on OnePlus forums and on Reddit, Google engineer Benson Leung showed that the USB-C cable and USB-C-to-Micro-USB adapter offered by OnePlus at that time did not conform to the USB specification. OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei on 26 November 2015 admitted that the cable and adapter did not conform to the USB specification, and offered refunds (although not for cables bundled with the OnePlus 2 phone). Reception XDA Developers said in 2020 \\"OnePlus usually does a decent job of bringing some of the new features it launches with its latest flagships to older devices.\\"  Products = Smartphones  OnePlus One = OnePlus One The company's first product was the highly anticipated OnePlus One. It was unveiled on 22 April 2014, and was claimed as the \\"2014 Flagship Killer.\\" The One had comparable, and in some ways better, specifications to other flagship phones of the year, while being sold at a significantly lower price at $299 for the 16 GB version or $349 for the 64 GB version. OnePlus One issue with yellow display band at the bottom of the screen which affected some units not covered under warranty. = OnePlus 2 = The OnePlus 2 was the successor to the company's highly successful first phone. It was unveiled a little over a year after the One, on 27 July 2015. It was highly promoted as \\"2016 Flagship killer\\". There were very high expectations for the second generation OnePlus phones, partly because the company managed to create a high amount of hype for the upcoming phone. One of the marketing channels used was YouTube tech reviewer MKBHD who was sent a unit, which he covered in detail leading up to the launch. The OnePlus 2 had specifications comparable to other flagship phones of the time, including the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, though OnePlus had decided to leave out an NFC chip, as it didn't see mobile payment being an essential feature at the time. The phone was also one of the first Android devices to sport a USB-C port over the older micro USB port. In advance of the OnePlus 2 launch, OnePlus assured customers that obtaining invites would be easier, and handsets would ship a lot quicker than with the OnePlus One. However, in a public apology, Carl Pei admitted the company had \\"messed up\\" the launch, and that OnePlus \\"only began shipping meaningful quantities [the week of 10 September 2015], nearly a month after [the] initial targeted shipping date.\\" Despite promising 24 months of software updates, and telling consumers that the OnePlus 2 would be updated to Android 7 \\"Nougat\\", it was eventually confirmed that this was not to happen, leaving the device on the older Android 6.0.1. = OnePlus X = The OnePlus X was OnePlus' entrance to the budget phone market, at 5 inches instead of the One and 2's 5.5 inches. The phone was unveiled on 29 October 2015. The phone was sold for $249, and consisted mostly of the same internal components as the year and half old OnePlus One, but had an AMOLED display. = OnePlus 3 = The OnePlus 3 was unveiled on 14 June 2016. The 3 was the company's first \\"metal unibody\\" phone. The phone launched with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB of UFS 2.0 storage. The phone was well regarded amongst critics, mostly for its low price and high specifications. = OnePlus 3T = The OnePlus 3T was unveiled on 15 November 2016 as a minor upgrade to the still relatively new OnePlus 3. The upgrade consisted the use of a newer SoC; the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 was replaced with the Snapdragon 821. Also introduced were a higher-capacity battery, 64 or 128 GB of storage and 16 MP front-facing camera. The phone launched in the US on 22 November 2016 and in the EU on 28 November 2016. = OnePlus 5 = The OnePlus 5 was unveiled on 20 June 2017 as the successor to the OnePlus 3, skipping the number 4. It launched with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, a dual-lens camera setup, up to 8 GB RAM, and up to 128 GB of storage. It was released in two colours: Midnight Black and Slate Gray. A third limited edition colour, Soft Gold was released on 7 August 2017. Another special edition colour was launched on 20 September 2017, in collaboration with Castelbajac. = OnePlus 5T = The OnePlus 5T was unveiled on 16 November 2017, as the successor to the OnePlus 5. It features the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC and storage options as its predecessor. Notable features include a larger 6\\" 18:9 display, a new \\"Face Unlock\\" facial recognition method, and an improved dual-lens camera. The device which came out of the box running Android 7 Nougat recently received the last major update based on Android 10 Q. = OnePlus 6 = OnePlus opened forums for the OnePlus 6 in April 2018 and launched the device on 17 May 2018 with sales starting on 22 May 2018. The phone notably features a display notch and water resistance (although not IP Code rated). The smartphone was the first from the company to offer a 256 GB inbuilt storage variant. It has a 6.28 inches FHD+ Optic AMOLED Display. It comes with a 16 MP aperture primary sensor with OIS and EIS and 20 MP aperture depth sensor for portrait shots at the back and is able to record at 4K resolution 60 FPS video and 16 MP aperture front camera at the front with Electronic image stabilization (EIS). It features a lithium-ion 3300 mA‚ãÖh battery and came with a 20 watts OnePlus Dash Charge. It was available in 4 colours, \\"Mirror\\" black, \\"Midnight\\" black, \\"Silk\\" white and red. It was powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 and Adreno 630. = OnePlus 6T = The OnePlus 6T was unveiled on 29 October 2018. It launched with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, a dual-lens camera setup, up to 8 GB RAM, and up to 256 GB of storage. It also features a larger 6.41\\" 19.5:9 Optic AMOLED display with in-display fingerprint sensor, and launched with OxygenOS‚Äîbased on Android Pie (Android 9). The camera has a 'Nightscape' mode which uses a longer exposure time to capture better photos in poor lighting conditions. OnePlus set a Guinness World Record title of \\"the most people unboxing a phone simultaneously\\" on the launch of OnePlus 6T. This was the first OnePlus phone to come with an in- display fingerprint scanner. This is where OnePlus started to become a huge competitor against Apple Inc, but Apple have never had an in-display fingerprint scanner in any of their phones. In the beginning, OnePlus 6T users reported unusual battery drain issue, which got fixed after a few days of usage. The reason to this is still unknown. = OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro = The OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro were launched on May 14, 2019 in Bangalore, New York, and London simultaneously and went on sale starting May 17. The OnePlus 7 Pro and OnePlus 7 are the first phones to go on sale with Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 3.0 storage. They are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 SoC and the Adreno 640. Like the predecessor, they come with an optical in-display fingerprint sensor. The front camera has a 16 MP sensor. They launched with Android 9.1 Pie and OxygenOS 9.5.0. The OnePlus 7 Pro features a curved edge-to-edge 6.67\\" 19.5:9 FLUID AMOLED display with a 3K resolution (3120√ó1440 pixels) and 90 Hz refresh rate. It comes in three variants: 6 GB RAM with 128 GB storage, 8 GB RAM with 256 GB storage and 12 GB RAM option with 256 GB storage. The OnePlus 7 Pro also features a 4000 mA‚ãÖh non-removable battery along with Warp Charge 30 technology. The budget OnePlus 7 which was launched with the flagship Pro version, comes in two colors, \\"Mirror\\" grey and Nebula blue. It is available in 6 GB RAM with 128 GB of internal storage, or 8 GB RAM with 128 or 256 GB of internal storage. It features a 6.41 inches FHD+ Optic Amoled Display (2340√ó1080 pixels resolution). The rear camera has a 48 MP Sony IMX 586 primary sensor along with a 5 MP depth sensor. = OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro = The OnePlus 7T was officially presented in New Delhi on September 26, 2019, and was available to order on September 28. The OnePlus 7T Pro was unveiled two weeks later. The OnePlus 7T is the successor to the 7 that was released 5 months prior for the European and Asian market, and to the 6T for the American market where the OnePlus 7 wasn't sold. It features a new form-factor compared to its predecessors, with a 20:9 aspect ratio instead of 19.5:9. This allowed for OnePlus to make the phone slightly taller than the older 6T and 7, while keeping the same width. OnePlus also included the 90 Hz Fluid AMOLED display previously found on the OnePlus 7 Pro. While OnePlus did keep the resolution at 2400√ó1080 pixels, the screen was one of its primary selling points. While the OnePlus 7T is considered a significant upgrade compared to the 7, the 7T Pro is a subtle upgrade over the 7 Pro. It features the same display, same body, same camera system; the main changes being faster charging, faster processor and a slightly quieter pop-up camera. Both phones are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855+ SoC and feature the same in-display fingerprint scanner found on the OnePlus 7 Series. Only one variant was available for each phone: 8 GB RAM with 128GB storage for the 7T (with another 256 GB storage variant for the Indian market only), and 8 GB RAM with 256 GB storage for the 7T Pro. Both have a slightly superior battery compared to their predecessors, the 7T included a 3800 mAh non-removable battery (4085 mAh for the 7T Pro) alongside Warp Charge 30T technology, which allows them to be fully charged in just under an hour. The OnePlus 7T had a new camera system, featuring the same primary and wide-angle lenses, though adding a third 2x telephoto lens (instead of 3x for the 7 Pro and 7T Pro). Both also feature a new macro mode, allowing them to capture pictures up to 2.5 cm from to the subject. The more affordable OnePlus 7T is available in 2 colors, \\"Frosted\\" silver or \\"Glacier\\" blue, and the 7T Pro in \\"Haze\\" blue, all being matte glass finishes. Both were the first phones to ship with Android 10 and OxygenOS 10.0 out-of-the-box. = Concept One Smartphone = On January 7, 2020, OnePlus unveiled the Concept One smartphone at CES 2020. The OnePlus Concept One uses electrochromic glass to ‚Äúhide‚Äù the rear-facing camera setup. The glass of the phone uses organic particles to create changes in transparency so that the glass covering the camera lenses can instantly shift from opaque black to transparent, presenting a clean, unbroken surface when not in use. OnePlus calls it a manifest of its ‚Äòburdenless‚Äô design philosophy. This optimal solution is called ‚ÄòElectronic CMF.' The rest of the design is inspired by the McLaren 720S supercar, with Papaya Orange leather on the rear of this concept phone and a sliver of glass right down the center of the rear panel of the device. = OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro = The OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were unveiled on April 14, 2020, and released on April 21 in Europe and April 29 in the United States. The 8 Pro is the first OnePlus phone to have wireless charging (Warp Charge 30W). All 8 Pro models have water resistance, although for the 8 it is present only on carrier models. The 8 and 8 Pro have a circular cutout in the upper left-hand corner of the display for the front- facing camera. This was necessary to achieve the IP68 rating, as the pop-up camera on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro did not allow for water resistance. Like the 7T series, both use Fluid AMOLED displays with HDR10+ support. However, a curved display is now used on both phones, whereas the 7T had a flat display and the 7T Pro had a curved display. The 8 has a 6.55-inch 1080p 20:9 screen with a 90 Hz refresh rate, while the 8 Pro has a larger 6.78-inch 1440p 19.8:9 screen with a 120 Hz refresh rate. The 8 Pro is one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a 30-bit panel. Both phones are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor and Adreno 650 GPU. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Storage and RAM options are shared between the two, with 8 or 12 GB of RAM and 128 or 256 GB of non-expandable UFS 3.0 storage. The 8 has LPDDR4X RAM while the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient LPDDR5 RAM. The camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \\"Color Filter Camera\\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. On 19 May, OnePlus announced that they would temporarily disable the colour filter camera on the OnePlus 8 Pro in China with an upcoming software update, for creating privacy concerns online. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera or autofocus on the ultrawide camera, which are now exclusive to the 8 Pro. The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor. Along with facial recognition, the optical in-display fingerprint scanner is carried over from the 7 series and 7T series. Both are available in Onyx Black (glossy) and Glacial Green (matte), while the 8 Pro has its own Ultramarine Blue (matte) finish. The 8 has two additional colors, a Polar Silver (matte) finish exclusive to the Verizon model and an Interstellar Glow (glossy) finish exclusive to the T-Mobile model. Like the 7T series, they ship with Android 10 and OxygenOS 10.0 pre-installed. = OnePlus Nord = The OnePlus Nord was unveiled on July 21, 2020, and released on August 4 in Europe and India. The Nord is the first midrange smartphone from OnePlus since the OnePlus X. It supports Warp Charge 30T. Additionally, the Nord has a single loudspeaker in place of the 8 and 8 Pro's stereo loudspeakers. The Nord has a display cutout in the upper left hand corner like the 8 and 8 Pro, which is elongated to accommodate the dual front-facing cameras. It uses a Fluid AMOLED display with a 1080p 20:9 resolution, HDR10+ support and 90 Hz refresh rate like the 8, with a smaller 6.44-inch screen and a flat display. The Nord is powered by the Snapdragon 765G, Adreno 620 GPU and supports 5G. Battery capacity is at 4115 mAh. It is available in three non-expandable storage configurations, 6 GB RAM / 64 GB UFS, 8 GB RAM / 128 GB UFS, and 12 GB RAM / 256 GB UFS.

A pub (in Australia) is an establishment performing many functions. These include serving alcoholic beverages, meals, functioning as a venue for various kinds of entertainment, and, sometimes, providing basic accommodation. History The Australian pub is a direct descendant of the British and Irish pub. The production and consumption of alcoholic drinks has long played a key role in Western social life and commerce, and this is reflected in the importance of pubs after the British colonisation of Australia began in 1788. However, in the 19th century the local version evolved a number of distinctive features that set it apart from the classic British or urban Irish pub. The lack of public buildings in rural towns in colonial Australia saw pubs serve as community meeting places for a range of local activities. Among other things, they served as a community hall, a venue for political meetings and a place where inquests were held. Early pubs followed the English pattern and were located in the front room of a domestic dwelling. The room in this \\"public house\\" were furnished with a bar, tables and benches, and there was often sawdust on the floor. They functioned under long established rules and regulations that governed every aspect of their operations. These required the publican to be of good character and pay an annual license fee. Regulations also specified hours of opening, who might and might not be served, the quality of drinks sold and mandated the provision of street lighting outside the entrance. Police and magistrates enforced these rules strictly, with fines and a possible loss of license for repeat offenders. Early pubs were distinct from hotels, inns and large city centre pubs, which tended to be larger and more elaborate purpose- built establishments with a basement and one or more upper floors. As well as a tap-room, or public bar, they often provided a range of other facilities, such as accommodation, a dining room, stables, parlour and a billiard room. Some pubs in tough inner-city suburbs had a reputation for violence and disorder. In Australian slang, such a pub might be referred to as a bloodhouse.

U. Khan and A. Y. Zomaya, Eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, US.  Definition  In recent years, opportunistic mobile social networks emerged as a new mechanism of communications in wireless networks. Unlike mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) that require end-to- end communication paths for message exchange, the communication in opportunistic mobile social networks takes place on the establishment of opportunistic contacts among mobile nodes, without availability of end-to-end message routing paths. As the mobile devices can make contact only when humans come into contact, such networks are tightly coupled with human social networks. Therefore, the opportunistic mobile social networks exploit the human behaviors and social relationships to build more efficient and trustworthy message dissemination schemes.J. Kolodziej, S. U. Khan, L. Wang, N. Min-Allah, S. A. Madani, N. Ghani, and H. Li, \\"An Application of Markov Jump Process Model for Activity-Based Indoor Mobility Prediction in Wireless Networks,\\" in 9th IEEE International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology (FIT), Islamabad, Pakistan, December 2011, pp. 51-56.  Opportunism in social networks  The GSMA estimates that as of January 2019, more than 5 billion people worldwide use mobile phones. That is more than half of the world's population. Most of the mobile phones in the current era are equipped with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cameras, sensors, and numerous other components. Moreover, most of the modern vehicles are also installed with communication interfaces and sensory equipment. Such a widespread use and availability of mobile communication devices create a huge number of contact opportunities among humans, and are key to the establishment of opportunistic mobile social networks.O. Khalid, S. U. Khan, J. Kolodziej, L. Zhang, J. Li, K. Hayat, S. A. Madani, L. Wang, and D. Chen, \\"A Checkpoint Based Message Forwarding Approach for Opportunistic Communication,\\" in 26th European Conference on Modeling and Simulation (ECMS), Koblenz, Germany, May 2012, pp. 512-518. The human mobility is the key factor in opportunistic communications, and there could be delays in message transfers as long as the humans carrying mobile devices do not come into each other's transmission range. Therefore, several research projects are conducted in various parts of the world to analyze the human mobility and social interaction patterns, and on the basis of that to build efficient message routing models that incur minimum message delays.  Social metrics  The most common social metrics that are widely utilized to build message communications by exploiting social networks are betweenness centrality, degree centrality, and closeness centrality. The betweenness centrality measures the extent a node appears on the shortest communication paths (taken by messages) among the other mobile devices. In specific terms, betweenness centrality quantifies the extent of information flow through the current node on the behalf of other nodes. In contrast, degree centrality gives a measurement of the direct interactions of a node with other nodes in an opportunistic mobile social network. The closeness centrality is regarded as a measure of information spread time from a given node to the other nodes in the network. Bubble RapP. Hui, J. Crowcroft, and E. Yoneki. Bubble rap: social-based forwarding in delay tolerant networks. Proc. MobiHoc, pages 241‚Äì250, 2008. is a famous message routing scheme developed for opportunistic mobile social networks that exploits the aforementioned metrics to establish communications.  Challenges  Opportunistic mobile social networks face numerous challenges due to the frequent disruptions and delays, and intermittent connectivity environment. One of the major challenges is the insecure communication in such networks, as due to the distributed nature, it is not possible to utilize mature security mechanisms, such as cryptography that requires centralized trusted authorities.O. Khalid, S. U. Khan, S. A. Madani, K. Hayat, M. I. Khan, N. Min-Allah, J. Kolodziej, L. Wang, S. Zeadally, and D. Chen, \\"Comparative Study of Trust and Reputation Systems for Wireless Sensor Networks,\\" Security and Communication Networks, 2012. Moreover, it is also difficult to maintain trust among the peer nodes due to the disconnected and decentralized environments. Data related to the reputation of the participating entities can be exchanged between them in order to build robust trust scores.D. Chatzopoulos, M. Ahmadi, S. Kosta and P. Hui, \\"OPENRP: a reputation middleware for opportunistic crowd computing,\\" in IEEE Communications Magazine, vol. 54, no. 7, pp. 115-121, July 2016. doi: 10.1109/MCOM.2016.7509388.  Applications  There are numerous applications of opportunistic mobile social networks, and more applications are evolving as the smartphone technology is advancing.  Opportunistic computing  Opportunistic computing utilize the shared resources, content, services, applications, and computing resources, by the devices connected in an opportunistic mobile social network, to provide a platform for the execution of distributed computing tasks.S. U. Khan, \\"Mosaic-Net: A Game Theoretical Method for Selection and Allocation of Replicas in Ad Hoc Networks,\\" Journal of Supercomputing, vol. 55, no. 3, pp. 321-366, 2011. However, opportunistic computing requires middleware services to cope with the intermittent connectivity and delay of the opportunistic communication environments. Also, participating entities need to be compensated and for that they should be able to negotiate the cost of opportunistic computing tasks and pay each other.D. Chatzopoulos, M. Ahmadi, S. Kosta and P. Hui, \\"FlopCoin: A Cryptocurrency for Computation Offloading,\\" in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, doi: 10.1109/TMC.2017.2748133.  Recommender systems  A novel application area of opportunistic mobile social networks is the recommender systems. Such systems track the user activities, mobility patterns, and utilize the user's contextual information to provide recommendations on variety of items.O. Khalid, M. U. S. Khan, S. U. Khan, and A. Y. Zomaya, \\"OmniSuggest: A Ubiquitous Cloud based Context Aware Recommendation System for Mobile Social Networks,\\" IEEE Transactions on Services Computing.  Mobile data offloading  An active area of research in the applications of opportunistic mobile social networks is the mobile data offloading.

Multiple Mobile Data Offloading Through Disruption Tolerant Networks, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, Vol. 13, No. 7, June 2014. Several research works are performed to utilize opportunistic mobile social networks in offloading of mobile data traffic to reduce the load on 3G networks.  Simulators  There are numerous simulators available that are used to analyze and replay human mobility patterns extracted from the real traces collected through various experiments. Some simulators are capable of generating synthetic human mobility patterns, as well as can simulate real traces; a few examples are given below:  ONE  ONE is a Java-based simulator, and supports the simulation of realistic and synthetic mobility patterns. ONE simulator has many rich features for simulating opportunistic mobile social networks.A. Ker√§nen, J. Ott, and T. K√§rkk√§inen, \\"The ONE simulator for DTN protocol evaluation,\\" in Proc. of 2nd International Conference on Simulation Tools and Techniques, 2009, doi.10.4108.  LEPTON  LEPTON is a lightweight emulation platform for opportunistic networking systems. Like many simulators it can simulate the mobility of nodes based on synthetic models or real-world traces, and drive the communication between these nodes accordingly. Being an emulator, though, it makes it possible to run for each node a full-featured instance of an existing opportunistic networking system (such as DoDWAN, IBRDTN, or aDTN for example).Adri√°n S√°nchez-Carmona, Fr√©d√©ric Guidec, Pascale Launay, Yves Mah√©o, Sergi Robles, \\"Filling in the Missing Link between Simulation and Application in Opportunistic Networking\\", in Journal of Systems and Software, Elsevier, 2018, 142, pp.57 ‚Äì 72, doi.10.1016.

It is taken as an example of an Indian company that declined. The Company NGEF was incorporated as a company in 1956 in partnership with the former company AEG (Aktiengesellschaft or Allgemeine Elektricit√§ts-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft) of Germany. It had six divisions ‚Äî transformer, motors, switchgear, power electronics, semi conductor devices and mechanical engineering. NGEF was once a leader in pumps, electric motors and switch gears in Bangalore. It manufactured pump sets, to provide continuous water supply for farms, and motors, to power the pumps, hence contributing its bit to increase agricultural production. NGEF also helped the Railways Modernisation Programme by executing seven major contracts for equipping 20 traction substations in the Central and Western Railways. It also manufactured the electrical components for the Kolkata Metro Line 1. Allegations There were allegations made against Ramakrishna Hegde by opposition leaders, in a case involving the transfer of shares by the NGEF company which was owned by the Karnataka state Government and run by public servant officers. In the mid-1980s the Indian Navy was to buy HDW submarines and torpedoes from AEG-T. NGEF, AEG's technical collaborator in India, was legally entitled to a commission on every AEG sale in the country. Instead it was found that AEG ended up paying bribes to public servants instead of the due commission. It was also alleged that Ramakrishna Hegde and J. H. Patel (both had been Chief Ministers of Karnataka) had joined with the NGEF administrators to deny the company the commission. An inquiry by retired judge Alvares found Commercial Director Srivathsa guilty of forging documents under orders from NGEF chairman Rao. The case was referred to the CBI who registered a FIR in March 1990. The bribes were found to have been routed to highly placed persons through Delhi- based Roger Enterprises. The COD headed by Diwakar also launched an investigation and presented a report to the Home Department in October 1996. Liberalisation The liberalisation of Indian economic policies in the early 1990s jolted many PSUs (Public Sector Units) in India, one of them being NGEF. It took a turn for the worse by the late 1990s. By mid 2000, the Government tried to revive it but when it was not seen as viable the Government decided to privatise it and put it up for sale. But no feasible offer came forward to privatise the company and hence it was shut down. However the land owned by NGEF was deemed valuable. Ernst and Young were the consultants that managed the process of phasing out the company. While about 1,800 employees availed of the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS), 122 refused VRS. NGEF closed down in 2002 after incurring losses. Aftermath NGEF is remembered for the land it owned, a part of it is currently a residential area called NGEF layout and the Baiyappanahalli metro station. The NGEF land was surveyed and the KSRTC, the BMTC and the BMRCL had sought 53 acres of the sprawling 240-acre factory campus in Baiyappanahalli in Bangalore. BMRCL constructed its depot, (Baiyappanahalli metro station), in the land. Also, KSRTC has built one of its bus depots and BMTC has built the Baiyappanahalli bus stand in the area. However while NGEF Ltd., Bangalore, no longer exists, its subsidiary in Hubli continues to operate. The unit NGEF (Hubli) Ltd. was set up in 1984 as a motor manufacturing unit of NGEF at Gokul industrial estate Hubli. By 1988 all Mfg, activities were fully shifted from Gokul industrial estate to Rayapur at 10 acres of developed land allotted by KIADB with 1,02,000 Sq.ft. built-up plant. While the Hubli unit continues to make profit and is hence supported by the state government, there were talks of reviving the Bangalore unit by utilising its property and machinery. In 2009, years after NGEF was shutdown, there were still some employees whose dues had not been paid yet.

Official document issued by the Bulgarian authorities to Kamhi, which served as a guarantee to Nazi Germany, that prevented him being sent to an extermination camp. Rafael Moshe Kamhi (Bulgarian and , 1870‚Äì1970; military pseudonym Skander Beg) was a Sephardic Jew from Monastir (now Bitola) in Ottoman Macedonia. Besides being Jewish, Kamhi felt also strong attachment to Macedonia as his native homeland. Kamhi was elected as liaison officer of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO). He directly participated in the Miss Stone Affair and in the Ilinden‚ÄìPreobrazhenie Uprising of August 1903. Kamhi is among the few survivors of The Holocaust from Thessaloniki after being saved by Bulgarian authorities; 90% of the population was murdered.  Biography  Rafael Moshe Kamhi was born on 15 December 1870 in Bitola, Ottoman Empire (modern-day North Macedonia) in the family of Sephardi Jews. His father was Moshe Solomon Kamhi (1842‚Äì1891). At the end of 19th century around 4,000 Jews lived in Bitola. Kamhi was educated at the Jewish Gymnasium and was multilingual: while he spoke Ladino, Turkish, Greek, French and Bulgarian. When he was 23 Kamhi decided to build for himself additional floor on his father's house. Later he hired there Fidan Gruev from Smilevo, an IMRO-activist who introduced him with his brother, Dame Gruev. Afterwards he became de facto member of the IMRO in 1894 and in his house was made a shelter, where the archive and the case of the organization were kept. In the coming years Gotse Delchev, Gyorche Petrov, Milan Matov, Pere Toshev, Boris Sarafov and others also were hidden there. Later the shelter was discovered by the Ottoman authorities and Kamhi was arrested, but he was released after paying a bribe. In 1896, he was made de jure member and elected as Bitola-delegat on the Thessaloniki Congress of the organization. In Thessaloniki was taken a decision of changing the nationalistic character of the IMRO-statute, which determined its members can be only Bulgarians. In this way the IMRO was open to all inhabitants of European Turkey. In 1901‚Äì1902 he participated in the \\"Miss Stone Affair.\\" After the decision to rise the Ilinden Uprising in 1903, Kamhi became responsible on the relations between the authorities in Bulgaria and the revolutionary organization. As a merchant he traveled often, and that made him convenient for that purpose. By these special trips he met with a number of Bulgarian politicians, including Ferdinand I and the Crown Prince, later Bulgarian Tsar - Boris III. Along with these frequent visits to Bulgaria, some of which involved his brother, they both were suspected and arrested by the Ottoman authorities. Subsequently, the brothers were interned in Debar. Kamhi directly participated in the Ilinden uprising in Debar while his brother, Mente≈° Kamhi (1877‚Äî1943), supplied rebels with weapons and other materials. Later the brothers organized a campaign to raise funds to the victims of the uprising in the Jewish community in Macedonia. In 1905 Kamhi participated in the Rila Congress of IMRO. After the subsequent split of the Organization, Kamhi maintained close links with left-wing activists of the Macedonian liberation movement as Gyorche Petrov and Dimo Hadzhidimov. He did not hide his dislike of the centralist's wing activists. The left-wing faction, opposed Bulgarian nationalism, but the centralist's faction drifted more and more towards it. After the Balkan wars Bitola remained in Serbia and he moved to Xanthi, then part of Bulgaria. At the end of World War I he joined the so- called Provisional representation of the former United Internal Revolutionary Organization. The Temporary representation advocated for autonomy of Macedonia as a part of a Balkan Federation. It threatened the autonomous Macedonia as a supranational state populated by different people as Bulgarians, Greeks, Serbs, Turks, Vlahs, Jews etc.The IMARO activists saw the future autonomous Macedonia as a multinational polity, and did not pursue the self-determination of Macedonian Slavs as a separate ethnicity. Therefore, Macedonian was an umbrella term covering Bulgarians, Turks, Greeks, Vlachs, Albanians, Serbs, Jews, and so on.

Due to the threat of a second national disaster for Bulgaria, before the signing of the Treaty of Neuilly, Kamhi conducted in 1919 a meeting with the then Prime Minister Teodor Teodorov, who struggled to keep order in the defeated country. He was offered to move to Thessaloniki, where the headquarters of the Triple Entente was located. He had to stand there with aim to present the interests of Bulgaria in Macedonia to the victors in the war. With the permission of the French General Charpy, he settled and stayed to live in the city. It is said he continued to work unofficially for Bulgarian interests in the period between the two World wars, when living in Greece.–í–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –°–µ–≥–∞, 22 –ê–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç 2000 –≥.: –°–ø–∞—Å–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ç –µ–≤—Ä–µ–∏–Ω –†–∞—Ñ–∞–µ–ª –ö–∞–º—Ö–∏ –∏–∑–æ–±–ª–∏—á–∞–≤–∞. During World War II, after the occupation of Greece, Kamhi participated in the creation of Bulgarian Club in Thessaloniki. In 1943, Rafael Kamhi was arrested by the German occupying forces in the city and had to be sent to a concentration camp in Central Europe. With the support of Bulgarian organizations and institutions as the Macedonian Scientific Institute, the Ilinden (Organization), the Union of Macedonian brotherhoods, the premier Bogdan Filov, and Tsar Boris III himself, he was released. Meanwhile, nearly all 54,000 Salonica's Jews were shipped to the Nazi extermination camps. The Jewish communities of Bulgarian-controlled Yugoslavia and Greece territories, numbering 12,000 were also almost completely wiped out. Kamhi's brother, who lived in Bitola, together with his relatives there, and all his relatives in Thessaloniki, were deported in Treblinka. Nevertheless, 48,000 Bulgarian Jews native to the old borders of Bulgaria, were saved. Two of the few survivors were his niece Rosa and nephew Joseph Kamhi, the children of his brother. Rosa after the war married the Yugoslav General Beno Ruso and Joseph moved to Israel. After his rescuing Kamhi moved to Sofia, where he remained until 1949, when he moved to Israel. After the war, at the request of the Macedonian Scientific Institute and the Jewish Institute in Sofia, he began working on his memoirs, still in Bulgaria. From Tel Aviv he continued his correspondence with both Institutes in Sofia. He died in ripe old age in 1970 in Tel Aviv. Legacy All the memories of Rafael Kamhi are now kept in the Bulgarian State Archive in the so-called Jewish collection of books and documents. The archives that he left contain documents in Bulgarian and Ladino. The collected memories of Rafael Kamhi were published under the title \\"I, the voyvoda Skender Bey\\" in 2000 in Sofia. In 2013, his memoirs were republished under the title \\"Rafael Kamhi: recollections of a Macedonian Jew revolutionary\\". The first work of Macedonian historiography about Kamhi was written by Todor Simoski and published in 1953. In March 2011 the President of Macedonia addressed participants of the Central Commemorative gathering in remembrance of the Holocaust of the Macedonian Jews and emphasized that Kamhi \\"was one of the promoters of the idea of a free and independent Macedonia\\". The Jewish Community in the Republic of Macedonia and Holocaust Memorial Fund of the Jews from Macedonia organized the event \\"Tribute to commander Rafael Kamhi and Heroes of Ilinden\\" during the national festival \\"10 days of the Krusevo Republic\\" in 2012.

Marketing departments, consultants and part-time marketing employees benefit by specifying criteria and outcomes for tasks and processes which are then interpreted, stored and executed by software, which increases efficiency and reduces human error. Originally focused on email marketing automation, marketing automation refers to a broad range of automation and analytic tools for marketing especially inbound marketing. Marketing Automation platforms are used as a hosted or web-based solution, and no software installation is required by a customer. The use of a marketing automation platform is to streamline sales and marketing organizations by replacing high-touch, repetitive manual processes with automated solutions. Marketing automation is a platform that marketers use to plan, coordinate, manage and measure all of their marketing campaigns, both online and offline. It is often used along with lifecycle marketing strategy to closely manage and nurture generated leads, aiming to convert leads into customers.  Overview  Marketing Automation is a subset of customer relationship management (CRM) or customer experience management (CXM) that focuses on the definition, segmentation, scheduling and tracking of marketing campaigns. The use of marketing automation makes processes that would otherwise have been performed manually much more efficient and makes new processes possible. Marketing Automation can be defined as a process where technology is used to automate several repetitive tasks that are undertaken on a regular basis in a marketing campaign. A tool that allows an individual to design, execute and automate a time-bound marketing workflow can be called a Marketing Automation platform. Marketing Automation platforms allow marketers to automate and simplify client communication by managing complex omni-channel marketing strategies from a single tool. Marketing Automation assists greatly in areas like Lead Generation, Segmentation, Lead nurturing and lead scoring, Relationship marketing, Cross-sell and upsell, Retention, Marketing ROI measurement. Effective marketing automation tools leverage data from a separate or integrated CRM to understand customer impact and preferences. There are three categories of marketing automation software: ;Marketing intelligence: Uses tracking codes in social media, email, and webpages to track the behavior of anyone interested in a product or service to gain a measure of intent. It can record which social media group or thread they followed, which link was clicked on in an email or which search term was used to access a website. Multiple link analysis can then track buyer behavior - following links and multiple threads related to product A but not B will show an interest only in A. This allows more accurately targeted response and the development of a nurturing program specifically targeted towards their interest and vertical market. This allows businesses to more efficiently and effectively reach target consumers who show, through their internet history behavior, that they will be interested in the company's products. Due to its interactive nature this has been described as Marketing Automation 2.0. ;Marketing automation: Has a focus on moving leads from the top of the marketing funnel through to becoming sales-ready leads at the bottom of the funnel. Prospects are scored, based on their activities, and receive targeted content and messaging, thus nurturing them from first interest through to sale. Commonly used in business- to-business (B2B), business-to-government (B2G), or longer sales cycle business-to-consumer (B2C) sales cycles, Marketing Automation involves multiple areas of marketing and is really the marriage of email marketing technology coupled with a structured sales process. ;Advanced workflow automation:Encompasses automation of internal marketing processes. These include budgeting and planning, workflow and approvals, the marketing calendar, internal collaboration, digital asset creation, and management and essentially everything that supports the operational efficiency of the internal marketing function. Typically these systems require a CRM or COM administrator to set up a complex series of rules to trigger action items for internal sales and marketing professionals to manually process (designing files, sending letters, sending email campaigns). This type of system increases the marketer's ability to deliver relevant content to relevant individuals at relevant times.

Biography He is sometime reported as a son of Nepherites I who ruled for a brief time before being deposed by an usurper, Psammuthes.Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, Blackwell Books, 1992. However, this statement is based on an interpretation of a passage in the Demotic Chronicle: > His son (i.e. of Nepherites I) was allowed to succeed him. (But) a short > time was vouchsafed to him... Nevertheless, the Demotic Chronicle never mentions the name of Muthis and, as pointed out by the Egyptologist John D. Ray, \\"his son\\" could be a reference to Hakor instead.Ray, op. cit., p. 155. It is also possible that Muthis was a very shadowly usurper, maybe related to the other usurper Psammuthes. Another option is that \\"Muthis\\" was simply a copying error, and therefore never existed; the latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that the name is clearly hellenized but there are no clues of what could have originally meant \\"Muthis\\" in Egyptian.Ray, op. cit., p. 152. Attestations His name does not appear on any monument, and he is only mentioned by Eusebius's Epithome of Manetho. Eusebius gave him a single year of reign and placed him at the very end of the dynasty, after Nepherites II; however, the Armenian version of Eusebius placed him between Psammuthes and Nepherites II.Ray, op. cit., p. 158.

It is the first installment in the Hyperdimension Neptunia franchise, and is followed by Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk2. The game is a take on the seventh generation era \\"console war\\" among the three major home video game consoles: PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii. Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1, a complete remake of the game for the PlayStation Vita, was released on October 31, 2013 in Japan, and in August 2014 in North America and Europe. Re;Birth 1 was later released on Microsoft Windows and distributed via Steam. Gameplay White Heart fighting against an enemy This game is in essence a story-based adventure game, in the sense that much of the game is spent reading the on-screen text, as in a visual novel. However, the game also features 3D-style dungeon exploration, similar to recent Final Fantasy titles since Final Fantasy XIII. Like most modern turn-based role-playing games, the dungeons feature random encounters, treasure chests, and various obstacles. These obstacles can be cleared by utilizing the various unique dungeon skills each character of Neptune's party has. During battle, the current turn for characters and enemies are displayed at the top right, as well as upcoming turns. When it is Neptune's turn or any other supporting character's turn, they are given a set amount of AP (Ability Points), which determines how many moves they can make. Each different move consumes a set amount of AP. There is a Sword move, which has the character slash an enemy with their weapon, a Gun move, which has the character shoot the enemy with their weapon (or in Neptune and IF's case, a gun), a Physical move, which has the character go straight up to an enemy and punch and kick them, and the Defend command, which consumes no AP, but puts the character in a defending state and ends their turn. When using a Gun move, the circle next to the Combo Counter on the right displays your current bullet. When the game starts, you will have a default bullet. However, as the game progresses, Neptune and the party will obtain other types of bullets, and you can switch between them during combat with the shoulder buttons. Different bullet types usually have special effects or elemental powers. Each enemy has a GP gauge, as well as an HP gauge. When that enemy is attacked, the GP gauge will decrease. When the gauge is empty, Guard Break mode will activate. During this time, that enemy will receive more damage than usual until the GP gauge refills. What sets this game apart from other RPGs is the Game Disc System, which allows Neptune and company to perform various special actions through special combos, accessible and editable through the pause menu. Neptune can summon characters from classic video games by initiating the combo assigned to that game disc, and it will inflict higher than normal damage. Neptune can also activate a transformation state, which is called HDD (Hard Drive Divinity). This transforms Neptune into a much more powerful state, and she will gain access to two additional moves, both of which deal massive damage. Although the default transformation is Purple Heart, Neptune can also install other game discs to change her transformation. Finally, she can also use the game discs to summon an image, which appears on-screen, then inflicts higher than normal damage on the opponent. Although the default image is blank, one can change the image by using pictures in the PlayStation 3 photo library. While a player is viewing the region screen, you can shop for additional weapons and accessories, transfer to another region through a dungeon excursion, view any side quests, and enter dungeons. Plot=Setting The game takes place in the world of , which is divided into four regions: Planeptune, Lastation, Lowee, and Leanbox. Each region is completely different from the others, and has a Basilicom where the citizens worship their country's goddess, also known as the Console Patron Units, or simply CPU. Story The player takes on the role of the main protagonist Neptune, one of four goddesses who is involved in a long series of conflicts known as the Console War. After an incident where Neptune is defeated following a one on three battle with the other goddesses, she loses consciousness and begins dreaming. Upon waking, she finds herself at Compa's house having crash landed earlier in front. Neptune reveals that she can't remember anything up to that point, which leads Compa to believe that Neptune is suffering from amnesia. After hearing from Compa that monsters have begun to run loose, Neptune decides to go hunt them along with Compa. During her first hunt, she suddenly transforms into her HDD form, Purple Heart, and defeats a large monster. Eventually the two meet IF, who explains that she is looking for treasure, and Neptune invites IF to join their party. After clearing another dungeon full of monsters, the party heads to the Basilicom to gain permission to travel to other landmasses to fight more monsters. Ending The game features three endings, which are the Normal Ending, Bad Ending and True Ending. Under the former two endings, the Console War doesn't technically end. There was a ceasefire if one or two of the other CPUs were recruited to stop the main enemy, Arfoire, but no armistice took place afterwards. There are two possible endings after the fight. If the requirements for the True Ending are fulfilled after Arfoire is defeated, the following events lead up to the end of the Console War. Development and release The game's name is derived from the scrapped Sega Neptune which combined the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Sega 32X into one unit, originally scheduled for release in 1994 or 1995 before the project was dropped after the release of the Sega Saturn. Nao from 5pb. Records performed the opening song of the game. The theme of the game, was released on a single album, along with the song Sincerely. Both songs are available on the album Prismatic Infinity Carat. Hyperdimension Neptunia was shown at a closed door event during the Game Developers Conference 2010 in March 2010. The game was released on August 19, 2010 in Japan, in North America on February 15, 2011, in Europe on March 4, 2011, and in Australia on March 31, 2011. Various different types of downloadable content (DLC) exist for Hyperdimension Neptunia, including character, quest, and item downloads. In total, $98 of DLC was released for the game in the United States.

Similarly to Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory, the battles feature a visible bar known as the \\"EXE drive gauge\\", with up to 4 stages that fills during battles within the same dungeon. Specific character abilities known as \\"EXE abilities\\" can be performed once the required gauge level is met. In addition, characters can execute \\"EXE finisher\\" attacks at the end of a combo, depending on the gauge level. The original continent travel system involving getting through dungeons, then named \\"Terraportation\\", has been scrapped in favor of a world map screen similar to that of Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2, and the dungeon maps are based on a style reminiscent to that of Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory.2014-08-01, How Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1‚Ä≤s Story And Localization Changed, Siliconera During the development phase, the enhanced Vita version was intended to fill in what were identified as flaws and shortcomings of the original game.2014-07-30, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 Q&A;, Tech-Gaming Developers aimed to address the concerns of fans, and features of the earlier PS3 version that were often subject to criticism, such as character interactions, game performance and the music, were totally changed and improved in the remake.

Its primary use is for the gentle and rapid heating of a variety of food ingredients and products including milk, cream, soymilk, ketchup, soups and sauces. Unlike steam injection and traditional vesselled steam heating; the steam infusion process surrounds the liquid food product with steam as opposed to passing steam through the liquid. Steam Infusion allows food product to be cooked, mixed and pumped within a single unit, often removing the need for multiple stages of processing.  History  Steam infusion was first used in pasteurization and has since been developed for further liquid heating applications.  First generation  In the 1960s APV PLC launched the first steam infusion system under the Palarisator brand name. This involves a 2-stage process for steam infusion whereby the liquid is cascaded into a large pressurized steam chamber and is sterilized when falling as film or droplets through the chamber. The liquid is then condensed at the chilled bottom of the chamber. Illustrated in the image on the right hand side of the page.  Second generation  The PDX steam cooker The Steam Infusion process was first developed in 2000 by Pursuit Dynamics PLC as a method for marine propulsion. The process has since been developed to be used for applications in brewing, food and beverages, public health and safety, bioenergy, industrial licensing, and waste treatment worldwide. On the right a diagram shows how the process creates an environment of vaporised product surrounded by high energy steam. The supersonic steam flow entrains and vaporises the process flow to form a multiphase flow, which heats the suspended particles by surface conduction and condensation. The condensation of the steam causes the process flow to return to a liquid state. This causes rapid and uniform heating over the unit making it applicable to industrial cooking processes. This process has been used in industry, predominantly in soup and sauces applications. Its possible benefits include reduced cooking times, easier cleaning with no burn-on, ingredient reduction and energy savings. The Pursuit Dynamics PLC food and beverage business was sold to Olympus Automation Ltd. in April 2013. In 2013, Pursuit Dynamics PLC, following significant financial losses, was acquired by Gaming Realms plc, in a reverse merger transaction.  Applications = Pasteurization  Steam infusion can be used to pasteurize a variety of dairy products. For ultra pasteurization, also known as ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) pasteurization, the milk is heated to temperatures in the order of 140 ¬∞C. During steam infusion, milk is brought into contact with steam at 140 ¬∞C for one or two seconds. The heating is instantaneous, and the milk is cooled rapidly by evaporative cooling exposure to a slight vacuum, removing any water added to the milk by condensation of the steam.  Cooking  Steam Infusion Vaction System Steam infusion is used in cooking applications on fluid based products. The heat addition on particulate level in a low pressure environment makes steam infusion cooking especially applicable to soups and sauces where particle integrity is important. Steam Infusion has shown the potential to improve the nutritional content of food and is being researched by the University of Lincoln  References  Category:Food science Category:Industrial processes ","title":"Steam infusion"},{"id":"41940949","text":"Winds of Chance is a 1925 American silent film directed by Frank Lloyd and produced and released by First National Pictures.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:Winds of Chance Cast * Anna Q.

The game was marketed to females by using characters that have a spirit of female heroism and friendship, but was intended to appeal to all sexes. Announced on February 13, 2014, Rovio stated that the game would be accompanied by a toy-line with Telepods, and a television series. The game was released on September 4, 2014. This game is based on an Angry Birds character who was first introduced in the Angry Birds Seasons level set \\"Back to School\\", which was released in August 2012. It begins with Stella leaving the rest of the Angry Birds flock and setting off to Golden Island to visit four other friends for vacation. However, Gale and an army of pigs steal Stella's photo album, which leads Stella and her friends to embark on a journey to retrieve it.Angry Birds Stella. Initial cutscene Gameplay Just as in the original game of the series, players use a slingshot to shoot an assortment of birds to nearby structures, with an intent to pop all the green pigs that can be either near, in, or on the structures. Players must also make use of each bird's unique abilities, activating them at strategic places and times while in flight to aid in defeating the pigs or destroying obstacles. The December 2014 update, New Pigs on the Block, added a storyline that features Stella and her friends in their treehouse looking for their house's missing items that were stolen by the pigs. They must complete random levels to retrieve the items. Characters *Stella: The main protagonist, a feisty galah who can parkour to shake things up. *Poppy: A pale yellow cockatiel who can instantly drop down from mid-air, smashing obstacles along the way. *Dahlia: A young long-eared owl who can phase through solid obstacles, before unleashing a destructive blast. *Luca: A male california scrub jay with a ranged sonic attack that will destroy any fragile objects. *Willow: A western crowned pigeon who can blast through obstacles with a sharp change in direction. *Gale: A violet-backed starling who becomes Stella's nemesis, ruling over the pigs. Telepods This is the third game of the franchise to be compatible with Hasbro's Telepods, a toy line also used in other Angry Birds games, such as Angry Birds Star Wars II. The Telepods are able to summon characters into the game that correspond to the scanned figure. Other than this use, the Telepods pack may come with other toy pieces and accessories for normal playing. Stella in other media=Television Rovio announced an animated series based on the game, with the first episode released on November 1, 2014 on ToonsTV, named Angry Birds Stella. The first episode was \\"A Fork in the Friendship\\", that shows how Gale, Stella's former best friend and queen of the pigs on Golden Island, separated from Stella and her other friends. The series lasted for two seasons, ending just a few months before the release of the feature film based on the main Angry Birds series. Books Rovio has partnered with Worldreader and Room to Read, two literacy charities, to produce a series of books featuring its Angry Birds Stella characters. Stella also appears in some issues in various Angry Birds comic book series and short story collections. Stella was featured in a manga story published in the Nakayoshi magazine not long after the game was released, titled Stella: Nana and the Magic English Words. Belgian publisher Le Lombard later released a two-volume comic book series based on the spin-off in 2015 and 2017 exclusively in mainland Europe, first in France, before they were translated in Czech, Dutch, Spanish and German. Willow appears on the front cover of Angry Birds Comics Quarterly: Monsters and Mistletoe, released on December 13, 2017. Although she does not appear in any of the issue's four stories, this marks the first time any of Stella's friends have ever appeared in an English- language Angry Birds comic book. More than a month later, Gale appeared in one issue in the year-long The Angry Birds Movie comic strip run, published by GoComics. Film Stella and all of her friends, except Luca, appear in the animated Angry Birds film adaptations with fully visibly wings and talons, as well as Gale, the spin-off's main antagonist. However, they play very small, mostly non-speaking roles in these films. As both films show that Stella's friends all lived in Bird Island in the first place, and that Gale was always a benevolent friend, they effectively retcon out the spin-off's plot and setting. * In The Angry Birds Movie, Kate McKinnon voices Stella, and Charli XCX voices Willow, while Maya Rudolph voiced Poppy for one scene without being credited. Stella and her friends put together a welcome celebration for the Bad Piggies when they first arrived. After the Pigs turned on the Birds and stole their eggs, Stella and Willow joined Red's effort to launch a counterattack on the Pigs and take back the stolen eggs, with the former being launched from the slingshot into Pig City. * Stella and most of her friends also appear in The Angry Birds Movie 2, but none of the voice actresses who portrayed some of them in the first film reprise their roles. Stella is seen running an apple stand at the time, while Dahlia, Gale and Willow are later seen taking part in a speed dating session, being suitors to Chuck and Bomb respectively in a rare moment in Angry Birds history where any of Stella's friends have a face-to-face encounter with birds from the classic Angry Birds flock. Gale and Dahlia are also enrolled in Avian Academy, unimpressed with Silver's invention, the Super String, despite the latter's knack for science in the source material. Willow and Poppy both witnessed the destruction of Mighty Mountain, due to Zeta's iceball and later, Stella, Poppy, Willow and Dahlia attended the wedding of Mighty Eagle and Zeta after the destruction of the latter's super-weapon. Music Willow, voiced by Charli XCX, sings the song \\"Explode\\", while performing with Stella and most of her friends as part of a welcome celebration for the pigs in The Angry Birds Movie. The full song is available on the film's soundtrack, and was also released online as a free YouTube video by the soundtrack's distributor, Atlantic Records. Reception The game has received generally mixed reviews with a Metacritic score of 66/100 based on 9 reviews. Pocket Gamer said, \\"It's Angry Birds. If you care about that any more then you'll probably find something to enjoy. Just watch out for the timers.\\" Some reviewers have praised the game for its introduction of new characters and return to the original style of gameplay. Discontinuation After the release of Angry Birds Stella, a third, unnamed episode was teased at the end of the game's second episode, but the episode was cancelled, and the game was discontinued on September 8, 2015. However, Stella's adventures continue in Angry Birds POP! and the second and final season of the Angry Birds Stella series.

Mechanisms and regulations  In May 2013, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a resolution on which bodies were empowered to draft, approve, publish, amend and abolish party regulations, making it the first party document since 1921 (when the party was founded) on how to regulate party life. Professor Gu Su, a constitutional law expert from Nanjing University, believed it was \\"a significant step by the new leadership to introduce rule of law into the management of party members amid a legitimacy crisis due to widespread abuse of power and corruption\\". Inner-party democracyHistory= It has been the party's policy since the 8th Central Committee (1956‚Äì1969) to democratize the CCP, and by 1994 the goal was to promote people's democracy by developing inner-party democracy. The meaning of democracy in CCP parlance has its basis in Vladimir Lenin's concept of democratic centralism. From its establishment in 1921 to it seizing power in 1949, the CCP was in effect continuously at war, and the centralizing element of democratic centralism became the basis on how the party was ruled. However, with its rise to power, members began to demand the democratization of the party. The 8th Central Committee, elected by the 8th National Congress, promulgated an 8-point resolution in 1956; > First, the CCP must without exception implement the principle of collective > leadership and expand internal party democracy. Second, the principle of > democratic centralism was defined as democracy under the guidance (rather > than under the leadership) of centralism and the essence of democratic > centralism is democracy rather than centralism. Third, all the business of > the 8th Central Committee was made public. Fourth, there should be no > idolatry. Fifth, the CCP should have regular deputies to Party congresses. > Sixth, a strict and effective supervision mechanism within the CCP should be > established. Seventh, the CCP should explore fixed terms of appointment > (rather than lifelong terms). Eighth, the CCP should protect and expand the > democratic rights of members.\\" However, these points were not implemented under Mao Zedong, in most parts because of the Cultural Revolution in which the CCP returned to the norm of issuing policy on the basis of centralism. However, with the end of the Cultural Revolution and the death of Mao Zedong, the party began looking in on itself, reflecting on the ills which had manifested themselves under its guidance. The 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee was the first to dwell on these issues. In 1980, Deng Xiaoping published \\"On the Reform of the System of Party and State Leadership\\", in which he criticized the party's emphasis on unified leadership which, he believed, had led to power concentration in the hands of a few persons. In practice this was made even worse because executive committees at all levels concentrated all power, and this power was then re-concentrated in the hands of the head or heads of the committee. He then concluded that because of the unified leadership system thought, most decisions were taken by all-powerful individuals (more often than not first secretaries) rather than by the party. The 6th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee endorsed these views. This stance was mentioned again in the Political Report to the 13th National Congress (held in 1987), in which it was stated that developing democracy within the party was a feasible project to develop socialism. The 14th Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee became the CCP's first endorsement of developing intra-party democracy so as to develop people's democracy. This line has continued to this day. The Political Report to the 16th National Congress stated that strengthening the democratic character of the party was a \\"life and death issue\\" for the party (without more democracy the CCP would face the same fate as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, CPSU). The party has made it clear, with announcements from both party and state organs, that the policy of strengthening the party's democratic character will continue. =PracticeRule of law=National Congress The National Congress is the party's supreme organ, and is held every fifth year (in the past there were long intervals between congresses, but since the 9th National Congress in 1969, congresses have been held regularly). According to the party's constitution, a congress may not be postponed except \\"under extraordinary circumstances\\". A congress may be held before the given date if the Central Committee so decides, or if \\"one third of the party organizations at the provincial level so request\\". Under Mao, the delegates to congresses were appointed; however, since 1982 the congress delegates have been elected, due to the decision that there must be more candidates than seats. At the 15th National Congress in 1997, for instance, several princelings (the sons or daughters of powerful CCP officials) failed to be elected to the 15th Central Committee; among them were Chen Yuan, Wang Jun and Bo Xilai. The elections are carried out through secret ballots. Despite this, certain seats are not subject to elections; instead, the outgoing Central Committee \\"recommends\\" certain choices to the party electorate. These figures are mostly high-ranking members of the party leadership or special guests. For instance, at the 15th National Congress, 60 seats were given to members who had joined the CCP before 1927, and some were given to the outgoing members of the 15th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and the 15th Central Committee. The party constitution gives the National Congress six responsibilities: (1) electing the party's Central Committee; (2) electing the CCDI; (3) to examining the report of the outgoing Central Committee; (4) examining the report of the outgoing CCDI; (5) discussing and enacting party policies; and (6) revising the party's constitution. However, the delegates rarely discuss issues in length at the National Congresses; most discussion takes place before the congress, in the preparation period. Constitution According to the CCP-published book Concise History of the Communist Party of China, the party's first constitution was adopted at the 1st National Congress. Since then several constitutions have been written, such as the second constitution, adopted at the 7th National Congress. The constitution regulates party life, and the CCDI is responsible for supervising the party to ensure that it is followed. The constitution currently in force was adopted at the 12th National Congress. It has many affinities with the state constitution, and they are generally amended either at party congresses or shortly thereafter. The preamble of the state constitution is largely copied from the \\"General Program\\" (the preamble) of the party constitution. Central Committee The Central Committee is empowered by the party constitution to enact policies in the periods between party congresses. A Central Committee is de jure elected by a party Congress, but in reality its membership is chosen by the central party leadership. The authority of the Central Committee has increased in recent years, with the leaders rarely, if ever, going against Central Committee, which often occurred during the early years of the People's Republic. The Central Committee is required to meet at least once every year; however, in the early years of the People's Republic there were several years when it did not convene at all; 1951‚Äì53, 1960, 1963‚Äì65, 1967, 1971, 1974 and 1976. While the Central Committee is the highest organ in the periods between party congresses, few resolutions cite its name. Instead, the majority of party resolutions refer to the \\"Party Centre\\" (Dangzhongyang), an indirect way of protecting the powers of, and resolutions produced by, the Politburo, the Politburo Standing Committee and the General Secretary. This method shields the central party leadership from lower-level bodies, reducing accountability, as lower levels can never be sure which body produced which resolution. In contrast to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), the CCP Central Committee does not have the power to remove general secretaries or other leading officials, despite the fact that the party constitution grants it those rights. When the CPV dismissed its General Secretary Do Muoi, it convened a special session of its Central Committee, and when it chose its new general secretary, it convened another Central Committee plenum. In contrast, in China, when the CCP dismissed Hu Yaobang (in 1987) and Zhao Ziyang in 1989, the Politburo, not the Central Committee, convened a special session. Not only did the meeting itself break constitutional practices, since the CCP constitution clearly states that a Central Committee session must be called, but the meeting included several party veterans who were neither formal members of the Politburo nor of the Central Committee. In short, the CCP Central Committee, in contrast to the CPV Central Committee, is responsible to the higher bodies of the party (the Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee), while in Vietnam the higher bodies are accountable to the Central Committee. Central Commission for Discipline Inspection The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) is responsible for monitoring and punishing CCP cadres who abuse power, are corrupt or in general commit wrongdoing. CCDI organs exist at every level of the party hierarchy. The CCDI is the successor to the Control Commission, abolished in 1968 at the height of the Cultural Revolution. Although the CCDI was originally designed to restore party morale and discipline, it has taken over many of the functions of the former Control Commission. The CCDI is elected by the National Congress, held every fifth year. Bodies of the Central Committee=General Secretary At the party's founding in 1921, Chen Duxiu was elected as the party leader, holding the position of Secretary of the Central Bureau. As the party expanded, the title changed several times over the next 3 years, until in 1925 the title General Secretary was introduced. The term General Secretary continued in general use until 1943, when Mao Zedong was elected as Chairman of the Politburo. In 1945, Mao was elected Chairman of the CCP Central Committee, the title he held for the rest of his life. The office of General Secretary was revived in 1956 at the 8th National Congress, to replace the office of CCP Secretary-General, but it functioned as a lesser office, responsible to the office of the CCP Chairman. At a party meeting in 1959, Mao explained the relationship between the CCP Chairman and the CCP General Secretary as follows: \\"As Chairman, I am the commander; as General Secretary, Deng Xiaoping is deputy commander.\\" The office of CCP Chairman was abolished in 1982, and replaced with that of CCP General Secretary. According to the party constitution, the General Secretary must be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), and is responsible for convening meetings of the PSC and the Politburo, while also presiding over the work of the Secretariat. The party's leader holds the offices of General Secretary (responsible for civilian party duties), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (responsible for military affairs) and state president (a largely ceremonial position); in the recent past, the party leader has first been elected General Secretary and then later been appointed to the other two offices. Through these posts the party leader is the country's paramount leader. Politburo The Politburo of the Central Committee \\"exercises the functions and powers of the Central Committee when a plenum is not in session\\". It is formally elected at the first plenary meeting of each newly elected Central Committee. In reality, however, Politburo membership is decided by the central party leadership. During his rule, Mao controlled the composition of the Politburo himself. The Politburo was de facto the highest organ of power until the 8th National Congress, when the PSC was established. The powers given to the PSC came at the expense of the Politburo. The Politburo meets at least once a month. The CCP General Secretary is responsible for convening the Politburo. Since 2003, the Politburo has delivered a work report to every Central Committee plenum, further cementing the Politburo's status as accountable to the Central Committee. Also, from the 16th National Congress onwards, the CCP has reported on meetings of the Politburo, the PSC and its study sessions. However, the reports do not contain all the information discussed at the meetings; the end of the reports usually notes that \\"other matters\\" were also discussed at the meeting. In the Politburo, decisions are reached through consensus, not through votes. In certain cases, straw votes are used to see how many members support or oppose a certain case (these straw votes do not necessarily affect the ultimate decision). Every member has the right to participate in the collective discussion. The CCP General Secretary convenes the Politburo and sets the agenda for the meeting. Each Politburo member is told of the agenda beforehand and is delivered briefing materials by the General Secretary on the agenda matters. The first person to speak at the meeting is the member who proposed the agenda. After that, those who know about the subject, or whose work is directly related to it, may speak. Then those who doubt or oppose the agenda proposal speak. Lastly, the General Secretary speaks and usually supports the agenda proposal, as he supported tabling it for discussion in the first place. When the General Secretary is finished speaking, he calls for a vote. If the vote is unanimous or nearly so, it may be accepted; if the vote is nearly unanimous, but members who directly work in the area discussed oppose it, the issue will be postponed. When the Politburo enacts a decision without all the members' agreement, the other members usually try to convince their opponents. In many ways, the CCP Politburo's policy decision-making is very similar to that of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union after Nikita Khrushchev's removal. =Politburo Standing Committee= The Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) is the highest organ of the Communist Party when neither the Politburo, the Central Committee, nor the National Congress are in session. It convenes at least once a week. It was established at the 8th National Congress, in 1958, to take over the policy-making role formerly assumed by the Secretariat. The PSC is the highest decision-making body of the Communist Party, though since Hu Jintao's term as General Secretary there is some evidence to suggest a greater role for the collective consultation of the entire Politburo. Despite formal rules stating that a PSC member must serve a term in the Politburo before advancing to the PSC, this rule has been breached twice, first in 1992 when Hu Jintao was appointed to PSC, and again in 2007 when Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang were appointed to it. Even though the PSC is officially said to be accountable to the Central Committee, in practice, the PSC supersedes the Central Committee and is superior to it. For example, there is no known instance for which the Central Committee has reversed a decision by the PSC. Moreover, many extremely important decisions in party history were made by the PSC alone, such as the decision to invoke martial law during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The membership of the PSC has historically varied between 5 and 11 members, and usually consist an odd number of people to avoid tie-breaking votes. The way by which membership has been determined has varied widely throughout history, from direct personal appointment by the party leader to extremely lengthy consultations with retired and existing party leaders. Secretariat The Secretariat of the Central Committee is headed by the General Secretary and is responsible for supervising the central party organizations: departments, commissions, newspapers, etc. It is also responsible for implementing the decisions of the Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee. The Secretariat was abolished in 1966 and its formal functions taken over by the Central Office of Management, but it was reestablished in 1980. To be appointed to the Secretariat, a person has to be nominated by the Politburo Standing Committee; the nomination must be approved by the Central Committee. Central Military Commission The Central Military Commission (CMC) is elected by the Central Committee, and is responsible for the PLA. The position of CMC Chairman is one of the most powerful in China, and the CMC Chairman must concurrently serve as CCP General Secretary. Unlike the collective leadership ideal of other party organs, the CMC Chairman acts as commander-in-chief with the right to appoint or dismiss top military officers as he pleases. The CMC Chairman can deploy troops, controls the country's nuclear weapons, and allocates the budget. The promotion or transfer of officers above the divisional level must be validated by the CMC Chairman's signature. In theory, the CMC Chairman is under the responsibility of the Central Committee, but in practice, he reports only to the paramount leader. This is in many ways due to Mao, who did not want other Politburo members to involve themselves in military affairs. As he put it, \\"the Politburo's realm is state affairs, the CMC's is military\\". This state of things has continued until today. The CMC has controlled the PLA through three organs since 1937: the General Staff Department, the General Political Department and the General Logistics Department. A fourth organ, the General Armaments Department, was established in 1998. National Security Commission The Central National Security Commission (CNSC) was established at the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee (held in 2013). It has been established to \\"co-ordinate security strategies across various departments, including intelligence, the military, foreign affairs and the police in order to cope with growing challenges to stability at home and abroad.\\" The idea of establishing a CNSC was first mentioned in the 1980s, but was muted \\"by vested interests that stand to lose power in a reshuffle\\". Currently little is known of the body outside of the CCP, but it is generally believed to have strengthened the party's control over the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the Chinese armed forces. On 24 January 2014 Xi Jinping, the current CCP General Secretary, was appointed CNSC Chairman, while Li Keqiang, the Premier of the State Council, and Zhang Dejiang, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC (head of parliament), were appointed CNSC deputy chairmen. Leading groups A Central Leading Group, also translated as a \\"Leading Small Group\\", () is an ad hoc supra-ministerial coordinating and consulting body formed to build consensus on issues that cut across the government, party, and military systems when the existing bureaucratic structure is unable to do so.This paragraph is based on Lu Ning, \\"The Central Leadership, Supraministry Coordinating Bodies, State Council Ministries, and Party Departments,\\" in David M. Lampton, ed., The Making of Chinese Foreign and Security Policy in the Era of Reform (Stanford University Press, 2001), pp. 45‚Äì49; and David M. Lampton, \\"China's Foreign and National Security Policymaking Process: Is It Changing, and Does It Matter?\\" in David M. Lampton, ed., The Making of Chinese Foreign and Security Policy in the Era of Reform (Stanford University Press, 2001), pp. 16‚Äì19. The authorization for the formation of leading groups comes from Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China. There are two types of LSGs. Party leading small groups manage policy for the Politburo and Secretariat, and State Council leading small groups coordinate policy implementation for the government. These groups provide a mechanism for top decision-makers to exchange views - both formally and informally - and to develop recommendations for the Politburo and the State Council. LSGs do not formulate concrete policies (), but rather issue guiding principles about the general direction in which bureaucratic activity should move (). A fangzhen provides the framework for the development of zhengce. The recommendations of leading groups are likely to have considerable influence on the policymaking process because they represent the consensus of the leading members of the relevant government, party, and military agencies. In some cases, the Chinese leadership will adopt an LSG's recommendation with little or no modification. LSGs, which have no permanent staff, rely on their General Offices () to manage daily operations and for research and policy recommendations. Consequently, the effectiveness of an LSG often depends on the effectiveness of its General Office.Jing Huang, Factionalism in Chinese Communist Politics (Cambridge University Press, 2000), pp. 414‚Äì17; and Kenneth Lieberthal and Michel Oksenberg, Policy Making in China: Leaders, Structures and Processes (Princeton University Press, 1988), pp. 26‚Äì27. Other organs There are several organs under the auspices of the Central Committee. The following are the most important: * General Office ‚Äî The nerve center of the CCP; acts as the primary day-to-day administrative body of the Central Committee, responsible for communication and drafting party documents. For instance, it handles classified documents and information from party organs nationwide. **Central Security Bureau (CSB) ‚Äî Responsible for the security of top party leaders. * Central Organization Department (COD) ‚Äî Established in 1921, functioning like the Organizational Bureau (Orgburo) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). At the beginning, the COD was principally occupied with creating files on the party's members, to see if they were committed communists or not. According to analyst Richard McGregor, \\"The Central Organisation Department is [the CCP's] third and least-known pillar of power\\". The COD is responsible for personnel appointments throughout the CCP. * Central Publicity Department (CPD) ‚Äî Controls news and information to the Chinese public. It functions to protect the interest of the CCP on the basis of the party line and the ideological concept of the Four Cardinal Principles. * Central International Liaison Department (CILD) ‚Äî The CCP's \\"foreign affairs ministry\\", responsible for relations with foreign parties as well as for gathering foreign intelligence. During the Cold War, the CILD fought for domination in the global communist movement against the CPSU's International Department, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, its responsibilities have widened to include foreign relations with all types of parties: communists, socialists, liberals, etc. * Central United Front Work Department (CUFWD) ‚Äî Responsible for increasing the party's support base outside its direct purview, in the business community and civil organizations, including eight officially recognized non-Communist political parties. * Central Policy Research Office (CPRO) ‚Äî Responsible for researching issues of significant interest to the central party leadership. * Central Taiwan Work Office (CTWO) ‚ÄîThe general office of the Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs (CLGTA), responsible for preparing agendas for its meetings, coordinating paper flow and communicating with other organs on the CLGTA's behalf. * External Propaganda Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee (CEPO) ‚Äî The party version of the State Council Information Office, responsible to the Central Leading Small Group for External Propaganda. This is a bureaucratic duality, called in China \\"one organ, two signboards\\", literally two names for the same institution. * Central Party School (CPI) ‚Äî Provides political training and ideological indoctrination in communist thought for high-ranking CCP cadres and rising CCP cadres. It publishes the theoretical magazines Seeking Truth from Facts and Study Times. * People's Daily ‚Äî One of the most recognized Chinese media outlets, the newspaper functions as the print media of first instance for the central party leadership in its communication with the general public. * Party History Research Centre (PHSC) ‚Äî Established in 1980 to set priorities for scholarly research in universities, the Academy of Social Science and the Central Party School. * Central Compilation and Translation Bureau (CCTB) ‚Äî Established in 1953 with the aim of studying and translating the classical works of Marxism. Lower-level organizations Party committees exist at the level of provinces; autonomous regions; municipalities directly under the central government; cities divided into districts; autonomous prefectures; counties (banner); autonomous counties; cities not divided into districts; and municipal districts. Party committees also exist at the neighborhood level and even within landlord and property management organizations. These committees are elected by party congresses (at their own level). Local party congresses are supposed to be held every fifth year, but under extraordinary circumstances they may be held earlier or postponed. However that decision must be approved by the next higher level of the local party committee. The number of delegates and the procedures for their election are decided by the local party committee, but must also have the approval of the next higher party committee. A local party congress has many of the same duties as the National Congress, and it is responsible for examining the report of the local Party Committee at the corresponding level; examining the report of the local Commission for Discipline Inspection at the corresponding level; discussing and adopting resolutions on major issues in the given area; and electing the local Party Committee and the local Commission for Discipline Inspection at the corresponding level. Party committees of \\"a province, autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government, city divided into districts, or autonomous prefecture [are] elected for a term of five years\\", and include full and alternate members. The party committees \\"of a county (banner), autonomous county, city not divided into districts, or municipal district [are] elected for a term of five years\\", but full and alternate members \\"must have a Party standing of three years or more.\\" If a local Party Congress is held before or after the given date, the term of the members of the Party Committee shall be correspondingly shortened or lengthened. A local Party Committee is responsible to the Party Committee at the next higher level. The number of full and alternate members at the local Party Committee is decided by the Party Committee at the next higher level. Vacancies in a Party Committee shall be filled by an alternate members according to the order of precedence, which is decided by the number of votes an alternate member got during his or hers election. A Party Committee must convene for at least two plenary meetings a year. During its tenure, a Party Committee shall \\"carry out the directives of the next higher Party organizations and the resolutions of the Party congresses at the corresponding levels.\\" The local Standing Committee (analogous to the Central Politburo) is elected at the first plenum of the corresponding Party Committee after the local party congress. A Standing Committee is responsible to the Party Committee at the corresponding level and the Party Committee at the next higher level. A Standing Committee exercises the duties and responsibilities of the corresponding Party Committee when it is not in session.  Private sector  Under Xi Jinping, party committees have become increasingly prevalent in the private sector, in both Chinese companies as well as foreign owned companies. In September 2020, the CCP announced that it would strengthen United Front work in the private sector by establishing more party committees in regional federations of industry and commerce (FIC), and by arranging a special liaison between FICs and the CCP. Members=Probationary period, rights and duties To join the party an applicant must be 18 years of age, and must spend a year as a probationary member. In contrast to the past, when emphasis was placed on the applicants' ideological criteria, the current CCP stresses technical and educational qualifications. However, applicants and members are expected to be both \\"red and expert\\". To become a probationary member, two current CCP members must recommend the applicant to the local party leadership. The recommending members must acquaint themselves with the applicants, and be aware of the \\"applicant's ideology, character, personnel records and work performance\\" while teaching them about the party's program and constitution, as well as the duties and responsibilities of members. To this end, the recommending members must write a report to the local party leadership, reporting their opinion that the applicant is either qualified or unqualified for membership. To become a probationary member, the applicant must take an admission oath before the party flag. The relevant CCP organization is responsible for observing and educating probationary members. Probationary members have duties similar to those of full members, with the exception that they may not vote in party elections nor stand for election. Before 1949, joining the CCP was a matter of personal commitment to the communist cause. After 1949, people joined to gain good government jobs or access to universities, which were then limited to CCP members. Many joined the CCP through the Communist Youth League. Under Jiang Zemin, private entrepreneurs were allowed become party members. According to Article 3 of the CCP constitution, a member must \\"conscientiously study Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents, study the Scientific Outlook on Development, study the Party's line, principles, policies and resolutions, acquire essential knowledge concerning the Party, obtain general, scientific, legal and professional knowledge and work diligently to enhance their ability to serve the people.\\" A member, in short, must follow orders, be disciplined, uphold unity, serve the Party and the people, and promote the socialist way of life. Members enjoy the privilege of attending Party meetings, reading relevant Party documents, receiving Party education, participating in Party discussions through the Party's newspapers and journals, making suggestions and proposal, making \\"well-grounded criticism of any Party organization or member at Party meetings\\" (even of the central party leadership), voting and standing for election, and of opposing and criticizing Party resolutions (\\"provided that they resolutely carry out the resolution or policy while it is in force\\"); and they have the ability \\"to put forward any request, appeal, or complaint to higher Party organizations, even up to the Central Committee, and ask the organizations concerned for a responsible reply.\\" No party organization, including the CCP central leadership, can deprive a member of these rights. Composition of the party As of the 18th National Congress, farmers, workers and herdsmen make up 31 percent of the party membership; 9 percent are workers. The second largest membership group, \\"Managing, professional and technical staff in enterprises and public institutions\\", makes up 23 percent of CCP membership. Retirees make up 18 percent, \\"Party and government staff\\" make up 8 percent, \\"others\\" make up another 8 percent, and students are 3 percent of CCP membership. Men make-up 77 percent of CCP membership, while woman make up 23 percent. The CCP currently has 82.6 million members. Communist Youth League The Communist Youth League (CYL) is the CCP's youth wing, and the largest mass organization for youth in China. According to the CCP's constitution the CYL is a \\"mass organization of advanced young people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China; it is a school where a large number of young people learn about socialism with Chinese characteristics and about communism through practice; it is the Party's assistant and reserve force.\\" To join, an applicant has to be between the ages of 14 and 28. It controls and supervises Young Pioneers, a youth organization for children below the age of 14. The organizational structure of CYL is an exact copy of the CCP's; the highest body is the National Congress, followed by the Central Committee, Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee. However, the Central Committee (and all central organs) of the CYL work under the guidance of the CCP central leadership. Therefore, in a peculiar situation, CYL bodies are both responsible to higher bodies within CYL and the CCP, a distinct organization. As of the 17th National Congress (held in 2013), CYL has 89 million members.

It honors New York City citizens who served during the 20th-century Vietnam War.  Description and history  Located in the Financial District in Lower Manhattan, it lies on a trapezoidal parcel of land that was formerly a roadway named Coenties Slip. The slip road was used from the 17th century by Dutch sailors between journeys. The slip was filled in 1835, and it then became Jeannette Park in 1884, dedicated to the ill-fated of the Jeannette expedition. Horticulturist Samuel Parsons was responsible for laying out the garden in 1886. By the mid-20th century, city planner Robert Moses had rebuilt the park with \\"horseshoe pitches and tennis, paddleball, handball, and shuffleboard courts all arranged around a tear-shaped asphalt plaza with a flagpole\\". Paul Friedberg was commissioned to redesign the land in 1971, to which he added the amphitheater fountain. In 1982, plans were unveiled to redevelop the land into a memorial, and the architects Peter Wormser and William Fellows, and the writer Joseph Ferrandino won a competition to design it. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Commission raised private donations of $2.5 million ($1 million from Donald Trump, who served as co-chairman of the commission) to finance the memorial in 1983. It was dedicated in 1985 by then-Mayor Edward I. Koch to honor the 1,741 citizens of the city who died during the Vietnam War and the 250,000 men and women who served between 1964 and 1975. Mayor Rudy Giuliani rededicated the plaza on November 9, 2001, following the September 11, 2001, attacks, as it underwent a $7 million restoration. A new ceremonial entrance was added providing access from Water Street to South Street and a black granite fountain placed at the center. The \\"Walk of Honor\\" contains 12 polished granite pylons with the names of all 1,741 people who died. In the future, the park may be the site of a Second Avenue Subway station entrance at a station under Hanover Square.

From 1983 to 1993, he was a FIFA referee and refereed 18 European Cup games, including the 1993 European Cup Winners' Cup Final between Parma of Italy and Antwerp of Belgium, held at Wembley Stadium in London, England, on 12 May 1993. His career was marked by his refereeing of the World Cup qualifying game, held on 13 October 1993 at Rotterdam, between Holland and England. The game ended with Holland winning 2-0. The result meant that England would not qualify for the 1994 World Cup and caused English coach Graham Taylor to resign his post. Subsequently, Taylor, as well as most English media, criticized severely some of the referee's decisions in that game.\\"How did it feel\\", The Guardian, 1 October 2006\\"Do I not like that: 20 years since Graham Taylor's World Cup failure\\", BBC News, 7 October 2013 Late in the second half, with the game at 0‚Äì0, David Platt was fouled by Ronald Koeman as he raced in clear on goal. The German referee failed to apply the rule of sending the Dutch player off for a \\"professional foul,\\" and showed him only a yellow card. The Dutch players charged down the free kick, \\"encroaching the kicker\\" and the shot was blocked, while the referee waved play to carry on.Glanville (2007) p.185 Minutes later, Ronald Koeman took a similar free kick outside England's penalty area. His first shot was blocked, and one England player was booked for encroaching. The free kick was ordered retaken and Koeman scored at the second attempt.Edworthy (1997) p.154 Dennis Bergkamp scored Holland's 2nd goal ostensibly \\"using his arm to control the ball.\\" However, two minutes before half-time, England were said to have been fortunate because a Frank Rijkaard goal was ruled out for offside, even though replays showed the goal was legitimate. A week after the game, on 20 October 1993, FIFA issued a statement to the effect that Assenmacher who was scheduled to referee the World Cup qualifier between Belgium and Czechoslovakia on 17 November, would be replaced by another German referee, Hellmut Krug.\\"Fifa blows whistle on Assenmacher\\", The Independent, 20 October 1993 The statement read, \\"After analysing the performance of [Assenmacher], the Fifa Referees' CommitteeThe FIFA Referees' Committee, FIFA website has decided to replace him with Krug.\\" Assenmacher would not officiate an international game again.

Biography=Early life Bayes was born in St Pancras, London, the second of four children to Alfred Walter Bayes, a painter and etcher who exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, and Emily Ann Fielden. Walter's sister, Jessie, was a designer in the Arts and Crafts style and his younger brother was the sculptor Gilbert Bayes. Walter Bayes attended the Quaker School at Saffron Waldon and then University College School before beginning work in a solicitor's office. He did not enjoy the work and in 1886 began to take evening classes at the City and Guilds of London Institute in Finsbury before studying full-time at the Westminster School of Art. In 1894 he spent a short period of time studying at the Academie Julian in Paris. Career By the turn of the century Bayes had already exhibited a landscape painting at the Royal Academy, in 1890, and had exhibited at the New English Art Club in 1892. Later during the 1890s Bayes began teaching, first at the City and Guilds of London Institute, later at Bolt Court School of Art and then at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts. He also started writing on art theory and criticism with regular columns in Outlook, Saturday Review and Weekend Review. He continued to paint, mostly landscapes in oil and watercolour but also developed an interest in theatre design. The first work by Bayes purchased by a major British gallery was Top o' the Tide which the Walker Art Gallery acquired in 1900. In 1901 he had painted scenes for a production Henrik Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman and in 1911 would exhibit both costume and scenery designs. In 1906 Bayes became the art critic of Athenaeum in place of Roger Fry. In 1908 Bayes was one of the initial eighty artists to join the Allied Artists' Association formed by Frank Rutter. At the first Allied Artist's Association exhibition Bayes met Walter Sickert, who invited him to attend the regular weekly meetings of the Fitzroy Street Group. When the Camden Town Group was formed in 1911, Bayes was ideally placed to become one of its founding members, as they also met frequently at Sickert's studio. Bayes exhibited work at all three Camden Town Group exhibitions and, in 1913, became a founding member of the London Group. He also exhibited at the Franco-British Exhibition of 1908. In the 1910s, a constant theme of Bayes's work were direct oil sketches of his wife and his sons. World War One The Underworld: Taking cover in a Tube Station during a London air raid (1918) (Art. IWM ART 935) During World War One, Bayes continued to teach at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts, which was close to the Elephant & Castle tube station on the London Underground. This was to be the site of one of Bayes's best known works, The Underworld: Taking cover in a Tube Station during a London air raid. The scale and composition reflects Bayes's pre-war work as a theatre designer and creates the impression that the viewer is passing through the station, and past the cast of characters on the platform, as if on a train. The picture was shown at the 1918 Royal Academy show and purchased by the Imperial War Museum, who asked Bayes if he would do a further work for the Ministry of Information. Bayes spent some time in Devon in 1918 preparing for what became Landing Survivors from a Torpedoed Ship. This painting was earmarked by the British War Memorials Committee for a proposed, but never built, national Hall of Remembrance. When that project was cancelled the painting was given to the Imperial War Museum but was destroyed by fire in 1977. Later career Battle of Britain: Parachutists from an enemy aircraft brought down in an apparent attempt to bomb Buckingham Palace (1942) (Art. IWM ART LD 2514) In 1918 Bayes was appointed Principal of the Westminster School of Art, a post he was to hold until 1934. From 1927 to 1939 Bayes was a lecturer in Perspective at the Royal Academy Schools and when he left Westminster in 1934 he continued teaching as a visiting lecturer at Reading University until 1937. Early in World War Two Bayes submitted works to the War Artists' Advisory Committee for purchase but was refused. In May 1942, however WAAC offered Bayes a short commission to produce a large oil painting on the subject of the air raids that had resulted in damage to parts of Buckingham Palace in 1940 and 1941. The resulting painting, Battle of Britain: Parachutists from an enemy aircraft brought down in an apparent attempt to bomb Buckingham Palace, led to further war-time commissions. During the war Bayes was a prolific contributor to the Recording Britain scheme, producing numerous views of interior locations that often focused on leisure activities and people eating and drinking. He produced 29 watercolours of London for the project, 23 of Essex and 20 of other areas, including seven drawings of Oxford. In 1944 Bayes became Director of Painting at Lancaster School of Arts and Crafts, finally retiring in 1949, aged eighty.

It had a subtitle that showed that the people doing it were against the fascism and that they were intellectuals. Meridi√† tried to maintain the prestige of a previous magazine called '. The influence of the political party PSUC was very important in the direction of the magazine. Nevertheless, there was a certain eclecticism in the direction and the collaboration of Meridi√†. Its pages contained a great diversity of topics of a great variety of s\\\\tyles. The magazine had an amazing quality with a lot of photos and images that illustrated all the works that were published in it. Moreover, it had an excellent typographic disposition. The articles were divided into different groups that were Collaboration, Politics, Arts, Literature, Shows and Humor. The editors of the magazine were Sebasti√† Gash, Dom√®nec Guans√©, Llu√≠s Montany√†, Joan Oliver, J. Roure-Torrent, M. Serra i Moret, Manuel Valldeperes and the head of edition was Joan Merl√≠.

We find essays and works of Pere Quart, Pau Balcells, Joan Comorera, Joan Peir√≥, Avel¬∑l√≠ Art√≠s-Gener, Francesc Trabal, Antoni Rovira i Virgili, Rafael Tasis i Marca, M. Serra i Moret, C.A.

Early 1980s  Eliete Mejorado started her career in the early 80‚Äôs as a performance artist, videomaker and actress in S√£o Paulo working with Luis Otavio Burnier and late choreographer Johnatas Gama. In the 80's she produced a number of experimental video works and solo performances that often involved music, dance, screaming vocals, miming, moustaches, wigs, physical theatre and drag. Some of her early work was performed solo or in groups in venues such as Sesc Pompeia and at legendary S√£o Paulo post punk underground club Madame Sata. From 1988-1992 Eliete Mejorado also studied Performing Arts at UNICAMP.  1990‚Äì2000  In 1994 Eliete Mejorado was rehearsing for a performance at Teatro Oficina when she met Bruno Verner for the first time. Eliete and Bruno soon found themselves creating a radical blend of atonalism, industrial, punk and noise improvising with a drum machine, an old piano and altered voices. These interludes would often happen during Roberto Zucco's rehearsal breaks. Both artists approach to performance, sound, voice, text and physicality were similar, resulting in the creation of a one-off art project that they later would baptize as Tetine. In 1995 Tetine was officially born with the debut piece Alexandre‚Äôs Grave - a multi-media performance for voice, piano, electronics and projections shown at an old 70-seat auditorium called Teatro HAU at Bexiga in S√£o Paulo. Alexandre‚Äôs Grave marked the first of a series of works Bruno Verner and Eliete Mejorado would perform or exhibit as Tetine. In 1995 her first album with Tetine, Alexandre‚Äôs Grave was released on High School Records. In 1997 Eliete Mejorado and Bruno Verner wrote the original soundtrack for the dance piece CREME by Adriana Banana, ex Cia de Dan√ßa Burra. On Creme, Eliete sings, play keyboards and produced a number of tracks for the score. In 1997 Eliete Mejorado, Bruno Verner and Ricardo Muniz Fernandes create a project called BABEL - curating the entire programme of the now legendary performance festival that took place in an abandoned petrol station in the borough of Pinheiros in S√£o Paulo owned by SESC. BABEL brought to S√£o Paulo a series of performances and art works by international and local artists such as Orlan, Karen Finley, Lindy Annis, Teatro Oficina, Tetine, Laura Di Vison, Kazuo Ohno, Gerald Thomas, Cabelo, PUS, Marta Neves, Fernando Cardoso, Carlinhos, Claudio Cretti, Adriana Galinare amongst others. During 15 days the festival occupied a deactivated petrol station in the borough of Pinheiros with unconventional exhibition spaces, an experimental theatre, a small cinema, a stage for bands and an open air catwalk for fashion shows. BABEL was for free and received an incredible amount of Brazilian media attention & public visitation during its two weeks of life. In 1998 Eliete Mejorado is invited to curate the music segment of MUNDAO at SESC SANTO AMARO bringing for the first time to Brazil, Diamanda Gal√°s, Marianne Faithfull and John Cale for special performances in S√£o Paulo. Other artists include Cibo Matto and a number of local artists.  2000‚Äì2014  In January 2000, Eliete Mejorado and Bruno Verner become resident artist at Queen Mary University of London, establishing themselves in the UK. At Queen Mary, University of London, Eliete Mejorado gave workshops on performance, music & sound manipulation to students of the Drama & Performance department and later created \\"Living Room\\" - an autobiographical spoken word piece for electronics presented at the university‚Äôs Harold Pinter Theatre. \\"Living Room\\" also took part of East End Collaborations Platform - a collaboration between the Live Art Development Agency and Queen Mary University showing emerging artists working with Live Art. In 2002 Eliete Mejorado was awarded the full scholarship Bolsa Virtuose from Brazilian government to complete a Masters in Performance at Brighton University, UK. In 2002 she collaborates with French artist Sophie Calle recording, producing and performing in the acclaimed electronic music album Samba De Monalisa - Tetine Vs Sophie Calle. The record was part of the collection Meld - a series of audio works and collaborations between artists released on Robin Rimbauld (Scanner)‚Äôs label Sulpher Records. Other titles from Meld include DJ Spook, Scanner, Stephen Vittielo. At the same year Eliete Mejorado and Bruno Verner co-curate a film programme, slide projection and performance night with Ian White at Whitechapel Gallery entitled The Politics of Self Indulgence including films by Taka Limura, Chicks on Speed, Tetine, Marina Abramoviƒá, Chilly Gonzales and debuting their Samba de Monalisa performance live at Whitechapel Gallery. In 2002 Eliete Mejorado and Bruno Verner fell in love with a new scene of female MCs of funk carioca (Baile Funk) from Rio de Janeiro and began broadcasting a weekly radio show called Slum Dunk on Resonance FM, 104.4 entirely dedicated to the genre. That's the first time funk carioca is played in Europe. After hundreds of radio shows spanning different periods of the genre, including a series of live interviews with Djs, MCs and people involved in the scene, in 2004, Bruno Verner & Eliete Mejorado compiled the pioneering mixtape Slum Dunk Presents Funk Carioca mixed by Tetine, released on Mr Bongo Records. At the same year they released an original blend of queer funk carioca in an album entitled Bonde Do Tetao on Bizarre Records in S√£o Paulo. Critically acclaimed in Europe and in the USA, Slum Dunk Presents Funk Carioca influenced an entire new generation of DJs and producers including M.I.A and Diplo - artists who were beginning to experiment with funk carioca at more or less the same time. Tetine's Slum Dunk radio show was responsible to bring Funk Carioca ‚Äì the intense lo-down Miami-bass driven sound from Rio‚Äôs favela parties ‚Äì within London‚Äôs cultural radar, giving exposure to a number of Baile Funk artists for the first time in Europe, introducing the British and Americans to a new genre, as well as playing Brazil‚Äôs most experimental segments of funk carioca culture including the proibidoes. The Slum Dunk show also covered from obscure electronica to post punk, funk carioca to avant hip hop, experimental mpb to film music and beyond ‚Äì through hundreds of thematic or free-form radio shows including live performances, interviews with MCs, producers, artists, curators, journalists, beat & party politics conversations, screenings and more. Eliete Mejorado was also responsible for the London premiere of I'm Ugly But Trendy - a film by Denise Garcia on the funk carioca scene, later also exhibited in Tetine‚Äôs show Tropical Punk at Whitechapel Gallery. In 2006 Eliete Mejorado and Bruno Verner put out 'A Historia Da Gar√ßa - a 12‚Äô release on Soul Jazz Records and the EP L.I.C.K MY FAVELA on Berlin's label Kute Bash. In 2007 Eliete Mejorado and Bruno Verner exhibit \\"Tropical Punk\\" - a Brazilian tropical intervention that took place at the Whitehapel Gallery with a programme of films, artist videos, fanzines, T. shirts and performances. In 2008 Soul Jazz Records releases Tetine's I Go To The Doctor as 12-inch - a collaboration with MC Deise Tigrona (previously released on Slum Dunk Music & Kute Bash in 2005, 2006 respectively) following Tetine‚Äôs acclaimed full album Let Your X‚Äôs Be Y‚Äôs. In an interview for XRL8R Cameron Macdonald refers to Eliete with the following quote \\"vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Eliete Mejorado often takes the stage in the scant garb of a Carnaval dancer, and leads the audience through sexually charged, politically provocative songs like the Tone Loc-sampling hip-hop number ‚ÄúL.I.C.K. My Favela.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fun and political at the same time,‚Äù Mejorado says of the band's ethos. ‚ÄúThe world is an ultra-technological place and super-sexualized, but people don‚Äôt really know what to do with their bodies.‚Äù In 2009 Eliete Mehorado is back in S√£o Paulo for a series of shows, talks, exhibitions and workshops on Tetine‚Äôs project Samba de Monalisa. Tetine are invited to perform \\"Samba de Monalisa\\" at Sophie Calle's exhibition Take Care of Yourself as part of Videobrasil.

It built by master brickmason William Benton Sr., who also constructed nearby Oak Hill, the home of President James Monroe. In 1915, the house was remodeled and enlarged with side one-story brick additions and Colonial Revival-style detailing. The estate was also enhanced with gates, walls, and terraced gardens that are reminiscent of English manor estates and state-of-the-art kennels and horse stables. Also on the property are the contributing spring house, smokehouse, and a guest cottage, all constructed around 1834, and early-20th-century structures that include secondary dwellings, a dairy barn with attached silos and a corncrib, a milking parlor, five sheds, a garage, a pump house, and a cistern. The Huntland estate was once devoted primarily to foxhunting, a sport that reinvigorated the economy of the region in the early-20th century. Between 1955 and 1963, the estate was owned by George R. Brown and Herman Brown of Houston, Texas, and Huntland became a retreat for notable Washington dignitaries including Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1962, secret international negotiations were conducted at Huntland that resulted in the New York Agreement between Indonesia, the Netherlands and the United Nations centering on the future of New Guinea.

AKD Group's chairman is Aqeel Karim Dhedhi.  History  ADK Group was founded in 1947 by Abdul Karim Dhedhi, father of the current chairman. It began business in 1973 as a brokerage house before expanding into investment banking and mutual funds. The group also sponsors sporting events as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). In 2007, the group explored investing in four coal-fired power plants, but their initial offer was declined due to the fact that, though financial capacity was present, they lacked the technical ability to assure success. In 2011, ADK Group was committed to the development of the Gwadar port and naval base, but was permitted to pull out of the arrangement alongside their partners, the Port of Singapore Authority and the National Logistics Cell because 584 acres at the mouth of the port necessary for the development were not surrendered as expected by the Pakistan Navy. In 2015, the company was among the first in Pakistan to create a real estate investment trust (REIT) management unit in response to easing of governmental regulations on investor ratios to create a trust to support the ongoing construction of the Arkadians. Arkadians is a 43-acre high-rise residential property that the ADK Group had been developing on behalf of the Defense Housing Authority at least since 2012. In March 2018, The National Assembly of Pakistan Standing Committee on Housing and Works praised the leadership of Dhedhi and the supervision of the AKD Group's CEO Ayesha Dhedhi in the quality construction of government accommodations to National Assembly members in the project. The Group has experienced some controversy. In 2013, AKD Group came under scrutiny under allegations of insider trading when it, along with other traders, invested in the Sui Southern Gas Co. owned by the Pakistan government just before the gas company's prices went up. In 2017, three of the company's top officials, including chairman Dhedhi, were arrested during a raid of the company for investigation into possible fraud related to the Employees Old-Age Benefit Institution. In August 2018, AKD was cleared for lack of evidence, with a federal report titled \\"False implication of AKD Securities in EOBI scandal.\\" During the investigation, the three officials remained jailed for months.

Plans for the domed stadium were proposed in 1963. It would have had at least 46,000 seats with plexi-glass skylights and a 17,000 vehicle parking lot. Inspiration for the building's architecture came from the Harris County Domed Stadium (now known as the NRG Astrodome) in Houston, Texas, which was under construction at the time. Delta Dome was to be built in Delta Park, the location of Vanport City, a housing project for World War II workers, that was destroyed in a 1948 flood when a Columbia River dike failed. The enclosed stadium was intended to attract a major professional sports franchise and increase the city's odds if they were to bid to host an Olympic Games. Plans for the Delta Dome were scrapped after voters rejected two bond measures in 1964 to fund the construction. Delta Dome had the support of Mark Hatfield, Governor of Oregon as well as Portland Mayor Terry Schrunk. When the city purchased Multnomah Stadium, now known as Providence Park, the push for a new municipally owned multi-sports facility ended. History Harris County Domed Stadium in Houston, Texas which was being built at the time. The idea for a stadium at Delta Park in Portland, Oregon, was started by a development group in the summer of 1963. They looked at building a domed stadium, similar to the Harris County Domed Stadium in Houston, Texas, which was under construction at the time. Plans for the Delta Dome called for a 46,000 seat capacity that could be expanded to 80,000, or possibly 100,000. Also included were plans for a 17,000 vehicle parking lot. Architects said the ceiling of the dome would be made from plexi-glass, which would add natural light. The skylights, which could be opened, were intended to add an open-air feel to the building. It was scheduled to be completed by 1968. It was estimated to cost US$25 million (US$ million adjusted for inflation). Measure 2 was on the ballot during Portland's primary election in 1964, which if approved, would fund the construction of the Delta Dome. The measure was rejected by voters, with 101,324 no votes to 91,961 yes. The Multnomah County Board of Commissioners denied the proposed bond in July 1964. The Portland City Council followed suit by rejecting supporters request (by a 4‚Äì1 vote) to put it up for a second city-wide vote during a council meeting on August 5, 1964. In August, Governor Mark Hatfield convinced Multnomah County Commissioner David Eccles to change his vote in favor of placing the bond on the general election ballot. In the county-wide contest, it was defeated with 102,281 people voting in its favor and 113,832 voting against. In March 1965, a bill was introduced into the Oregon House of Representatives which would fund the Delta Dome by imposing a three percent tax on hotels and other forms of lodgings to out-of-state residents. However in November 1965, the City of Portland purchased Multnomah Stadium from the Multnomah Athletic Club putting to rest the city's need for a multi-sports facility. Opposition The bond measures ultimately failed, due in part to voters not believing Portland could attract or sustain a major sports franchise. The Oregonian noted that the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, which opened five years before, was hemorrhaging money without a permanent tenant. Another issue raised was the traffic on Interstate 5, which opponents said would get worse if the stadium was erected. Opposition also grew around potential tax increases. Worries of flood damage was another concern, since it was in the area that flooded two decades prior. Supporters The group funding advertisements in favor of the bond measure were known as \\"Volunteers for Delta Dome\\". Robert Richett was their chairman. One of the biggest attractions of the stadium was that it was enclosed, so games would not have to be canceled due to inclement weather. A scale model of the stadium was unveiled in October 1964 where supporters sang a song entitled \\"New Delta Stadium, Where it Never Rains\\". Supporters of the stadium claimed that building a second stadium in Portland would make bids on behalf of the city to the International Olympic Committee to host an Olympic Games more feasible. A consulting firm conducted a study which predicted a US$800,000 profit for the tax base. Opponents of the bond criticized the study because it assumed Portland would attract several large events when the stadium opened, which they contended should not be assumed. Shortly before the county voted on the bond measure, pro-Delta Dome leaflets were mistakenly included with material that attacked President Lyndon B. Johnson's re-election campaign. After it was voted down in November 1964, there was speculation that the Delta Dome would form a corporation and issue stock for citizens to buy, but the idea never materialized. ;Politicians *Vic Atiyeh, future Governor of Oregon *Donald G.

Biography  Samuel Marsh was born in 1786, at Haverhill, Massachusetts, and died in 1872, at the Astor House, New York, at which place he had resided a greater portion of his long and useful life. His New England ancestry, a long-lived and estimable family, traced back through the landing of the Pilgrims in 1638, becomes in the twelfth century, not Marsh, but de Marisco, with Marsh quaintly written as a parenthetical alternative in the manuscripts. Samuel Marsh came to New York during the War of 1812, and from that time made the metropolis his home. After the cessation of hostilities with Great Britain, he travelled long in Europe for the purpose of completing his business education and familiarizing himself with the usages of European trade. In 1819 he established the New York Dyeing and Printing Company, with factories on Staten Island, and was its president until his death. The development of the canals of the United States greatly interested him, and in the early part of the century, in connection with Erastus Corning, Horatio Seymour, and others, he projected a canal system by which the waters of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River were to be connected. The name of the enterprise was the Fox River Improvement Company. Many millions of dollars have been expended on it. The project greatly aided the material growth of the State of Wisconsin, although as yet the canal is not available for vessels of deep-water draught. Astor House, New York City 1862 Mr. Marsh was among the pioneers of railways in America. He was one of the twenty gentlemen who met in 1845, at the New York Hotel, on the invitation of Benjamin Loder, and united in a subscription amounting to three millions of dollars, which was intended to complete the construction of the Erie. From 1846 until 1865, Mr. Marsh was vice-president of the Erie Railroad, his incumbency of that position being occasionally interrupted by his being called upon to assume the duties of president ad interim. He invariably declined to permanently assume the office of president of the corporation. Mr. Marsh engaged with the late Moses Taylor, John I. Blair, and others in construction of railroads in various parts of the country, and until within a few weeks of his death, at the age of eighty-six, he actively superintendent the vast interests under his control. Although he never married, his home at the Astor House was a happy one, and many friends were made welcome there, and many of the older New Yorkers spent care- dispelling hours in his company. Mr. Marsh was the ever-watchful adviser and instructor of his nephew, Nathaniel Marsh, appointed receiver by the courts, as to his duties as secretary, receiver, and president of Erie.  Work = New York Dyeing and Printing Company  In 1819 Samuel Marsh established the New York Dyeing and Printing Company, with factories on Staten Island. Around 1824 it passed into the hands of a Joint Stock Company, who, soon after obtaining their charter, added to the dyeing business, heretofore carried on alone, that of the printing. In the 1850s the New York Dyeing and Printing Company located at Factoryville in Staten Island was one of the largest establishments of that country, in which the dyeing and printing of silk and cotton goods is carried on. An 1854 article in The New York Times described: :The buildings are extensive, covering upwards of four acres. The printing shop is a large four-story frame building. Some dress patterns, and some woolen and cotton goods are printed in this department, but the staple article is silk handkerchiefs, which are to be seen in every variety, and of the most durable styles. Some two thousand pieces were printed in one season, two years ago. During the busy season of the year, now at hand, fifty printers are employed in the building, each having a boy or girl who tears for him. The adult workmen are paid by piece-work, and can earn from 14 shillings to $2 per day. There are three modes of printing, by blocks, cylinders and stereotype plates, all of which are practiced there. There is a separate department called the \\"Print-cutters' shop,\\" in which the blocks used in the printing are all made. Some of these blocks are cut at very considerable expense. We observed also two designers busily at work here... By 1860 the company employing over 200 people and eight steam engines annually producing over five million yard of cotton muslin. Beside this company, Samuel Marsh had founded related firms such as \\"The New York India Rubber Cloth Company,\\". This company was founded in 1835 in cooperation with Nathan Barrett and some other persons associated with them, for the purpose of manufacturing water-proof cloth and other articles incident thereto. It was located in the town of Castletown, county of Richmond.  Acting President in New York and Erie Railroad Company  Although Samuel Marsh was the official head of the New York and Erie Railroad Company from 1859 to 1862 - being the last President of the old Company - the direction of its affairs was his merely in a formal way, as the Company was in the custody of the court, and Nathaniel Marsh, as Receiver, was the officer and agent of the court to manage and direct the business of the Company until the legal requirements of the situation might be met, and the property handed back to the possession of its owners. President Marsh's office was simply an advisory one, and while his ideas, and those of the Board, might have been acted upon, and in many instances were, by the Receiver, the latter was in no way bound to follow any such instruction or advice. Erie Railroad, payment plan, 1859 Erie, total matured liabilities, 1859 A man of less experience in Erie matters, however, might have been of much hindrance to the Receiver in the management of the complicated business of the Company. Samuel Marsh having been Vice-President of the Company several years, had a knowledge that was of much service to the Receiver, and his application of it aided greatly in hastening the development and success of the plans that were devised for Erie's rehabilitation. Receiver Marsh found a most discouraging outlook when he took charge of the Company's property. He subsequently wrote: :The income of the road, owing to the depressed state of business generally, and to other causes (as the Receiver put it), was barely sufficient to defray the current expenses... Meanwhile, claims for labor and supplies, and judgments rendered before his appointment, and rents and unpaid taxes, were pressing for immediate payment. These claims amounted to more than $700,000. The forbearance of the creditors, and especially of the employees, whose pay was some months in arrears, relieved the Receiver of much embarrassment, and increased earnings enabled him, in the course of four months after his appointment, to discharge all these claims, and pay the current expenses of the road. The settlement of these claims, and providing for payment of future interest on the mortgage debt out of the earnings of the road, would have continued the road in the hands of a Receiver for years, so an agreement was made between the stockholders and the creditors of the Company, by which the conflicting interests among the latter should be submitted to the adjudication of Trustees. October 22, 1859, a contract was made by the Company with J.C. Bancroft Davis and Dudley S. Gregory, who, under its provisions, undertook the task. The plan they proposed was that the unsecured bondholders should exchange their bonds, with four years' accrued interest, for seven per cent, preferred stock, and that the common stockholders should stand, as they then were, subsequent in interest to the creditors of the Company.  Financial reorganization  Henry Varnum Poor (1860) explained in more details, that on the 16th of Aug., 1859, at the suit of the Fourth Mortgage Bondholders for the foreclosure of this mortgage, a Receiver was appointed to take charge of the road and its effects. He was directed to pay, in the first place, all arrearages due employees of the road; also for supplies used in operating it; also all other charges incident to its protection and maintenance, and to hold the net earnings subject to the order of the Court. There were received by him from earnings and other sources, up to 1st Jan., 1860, $2,424,452. The payments in the meantime were as follows: : Payments on account of interest on First Mortgage Bonds... $ 207,270 : Payments on account of current expenses, arrearages, etc. $ 2,145,007 : Payments on account of judgments against the Company... $ 45,000 ::::::::Cash on hand January 1st, 1860... $ 27,175 :::::::::::::::Total... $ 2,424,452 The following proposition has been made for adjusting the affairs of the Company: To capitalize the Unsecured Bonds, with the interest due on the same, and for two years in advance, into a Preferred Stock, bearing 7 per cent, interest; the 1st Mortgage bondholders to extend the term for the payment of their coupons to March 1, 1860; the 2d Mortgage to Sept., 1860; the 3d Mortgage to March, 1861; the 4th and 5th Mortgages to Dec. 1st, 1861. In case of foreclosure, the same relations between the different classes of bondholders and stockholders to be preserved. In the meantime it is expected that the net earnings will discharge the liabilities of the Company, the overdue coupons, and supply the means for the completion of the Long Dock, estimated at ¬ß500,000.  New Erie Railway Company  New common capital stock certificate of the Erie Railroad Company, 1860s. In 1861, William Buck Dana (1829‚Äì1910) reports in the Merchants Magazine and Commercial Review reports, that the new corporation of the Erie Railway Company was organized in May 1861 by the election of Nathaniel Marsh as President; Samuel Marsh as Vice President; H.N. Otis, Secretary; and Talman J. Waters, Treasurer, and the directors of the late New-York and Erie Company as directors; Mr. Wright, of Binghamton, and Mr. Diven, of Elmira, being substituted for Mr. Conn and Mr. Gelpcke. The capital, in common shares, to consist of so much of the present $11,550,000 as may be assented to file contract of reorganization before the 29th of July next; and the capital in preferred shares to be so much of the unsecured and judgment debt as shall be assented by the same time, together with the arrearages of interest thereon, the whole estimated at about $8,000,000, or the equivalent of about 80,000 preferred shares.  Second presidency in 1864  In 1864 following the death of President Nathaniel Marsh, his uncle, Samuel Marsh, then Vice- President of the Company, was chosen President pro tempore. Samuel Marsh was the head of the New York Dyeing and Bleaching Company, and had been for sixteen years a member of the Erie Directory, during which time he had been Vice-President, and President through the Receivership of Nathaniel Marsh. He was the logical successor to the Presidency, and if he had insisted on being chosen, the honor would undoubtedly have been bestowed upon him for the term ; but there were influences coming to the fore in Erie affairs just then that preferred another head to the Company, and Samuel Marsh declined to be a candidate for the office.

Some other Acadians provided military intelligence, sanctuary, and logistical support to the resistance movement. (And other Acadians remained neutral in the contest between the French‚ÄìWabanaki Confederacy forces and the British.) The Acadian militias achieved effective resistance for more than 75 years and through six wars before their eventual demise. According to Acadian historian Maurice Basque, the story of Evangeline continues to influence historic accounts of the deportation, emphasising neutral Acadians and de-emphasising those who resisted the British. While Acadian militia was briefly active during the American Revolution, the militias were dormant throughout the nineteenth century. After confederation, Acadians eventually joined the Canadian War efforts in World War I and World War II. The most well-known colonial leaders of these militias were Joseph Broussard and Joseph-Nicolas Gautier.  Contest for supremacy in North America = King William's War (1688-1697)  The first war to influence the Acadians is now known as King William's War, and began in 1688. Much of the local conflict was orchestrated by the Governor of Acadia and Baron de St Castin, who raided Protestant villages along the Acadia-New England border at the Kennebec River in present-day Maine. The crews of the French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste were primarily Acadian. The Acadians resisted during the Raid on Chignecto (1696). Colonel Benjamin Church and four hundred men (50 to 150 of whom were Indians, likely Iroquois) arrived offshore of Beaubassin on September 20. When they came ashore, the Acadians and Mi‚Äôkmaq opened fire on them. Church lost a lieutenant and several of his men.Church, p. 228 They managed to get ashore and surprise the Acadians. Many fled while one confronted Church with papers showing they had signed an oath of allegiance in 1690 to the English King. Church was unconvinced, especially after he discovered the proclamation heralding the French success at Pemaquid posted on the church door. On October 18 Church and his troops arrived opposite the capital of Acadia, in the Siege of Fort Nashwaak (1696), landed three cannons and assembled earthworks on the south bank of the Nashwaak River. Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste was there to defend the capital. Baptiste joined the Maliseet from Meductic for the duration of the siege. There was a fierce exchange of gun fire for two days, with the advantage going to the better sited French guns. The New Englanders were defeated, having suffered eight killed and seventeen wounded. The French lost one killed and two wounded.Roger Marsters. 2004. p. 34 Letters from an Acadian official censured and requested the removal of certain priests, called \\"do nothings\\", who took no part in the King William's War but attended strictly to their religious duties and were therefore suspected of favouring the British. After the Siege of Pemaquid (1696), d'Iberville led a force of 124 Canadians, Acadians, Mi‚Äôkmaq and Abenaki in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. They destroyed almost every British settlement in Newfoundland, killed more than 100 British and captured many more. They deported almost 500 British colonists to Britain or France.  Queen Anne's War (1702‚Äì1713)  Raid on Grand Pre (1704) During Queen Anne's War, the members of the Wabanaki Confederacy from Acadia raided Protestant settlements along the Acadia/ New England border in present- day Maine in the Northeast Coast Campaign (1703) . Mi‚Äôkmaq and Acadians resisted the New England retaliatory Raid on Grand Pr√©, Piziquid and Chignecto in 1704. The raid was led by Benjamin Church who was fired on by the local militia, who had gathered in the woods along the banks. According to Church, on the first day of the raid, the Acadians and Mi‚Äôkmaq \\"fired smartly at our forces\\".Benjamin Church, p. 273 Church had a small cannon on his boat, which he used to fire grape shot at the attackers on the shore, who withdrew, suffering one Mi‚Äôkmaw killed and several wounded. Church was unable to come ashore. Having withdrawn from the village, the next morning the Acadian and Mi‚Äôkmaw militia waited in the woods for Church and his men to arrive. At the break of day, the New Englanders again set off toward the village, under orders from Church to drive any resistance before them. The largest body of defenders fired on the raiders' right flank from behind trees and logs, but their fire was ineffective and they were driven off.  Conquest of Acadia and the Treaty of Utrecht  Acadians joined the French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste as crew members in his victories over British vessels. Acadians also fought alongside the Confederacy and French soldiers to protect the capital in the Siege of Port Royal (1707) and the final Conquest of Acadia. Acadians and the Wabanaki Confederacy were also successful in the Battle of Bloody Creek (1711). The victory at Bloody Creek rallied the local resistance, and prompted many of the Acadians who were nominally under British protection to withdraw to the north. Soon thereafter a force of some 600 warriors, including Acadians, Abenaki, and Mi‚Äôkmaq, under the leadership of Gaulin and Saint-Castin, gathered and blockaded Fort Anne. The defending garrison was small, but the attackers had no artillery and were thus unable to make an impression on the fort, and the fort was still accessible by sea. Gaulin went to Plaisance in Newfoundland for supplies and equipment to advance the siege; Governor Philippe Pastour de Costebelle provided supplies, but the ship had the misfortune to encounter a major British fleet and was captured. That same expedition abandoned its goal of attacking Quebec when eight of its ships were lost on the shores of the Saint Lawrence River; Governor Vetch, who had accompanied the expedition as a leader of the provincial militia, returned to Annapolis Royal with 200 provincial militia, after which the besiegers withdrew. In the March 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, the French ceded \\"all Nova Scotia or Acadie, with its ancient boundaries, as also the city of Port Royal, now called Annapolis Royal, and all other things in those parts, which depend on the said lands and islands\\" to the British, but retained \\"the island called Cape Breton, as also all others, both in the mouth of the river of St. Lawrence, and in the gulph of the same name\\" with exception of the \\"island called Newfoundland with the adjacent islands,\\" which \\"shall from this time forward belong of right wholly to Britain\\". For whatever reason, most Acadians refused to swear an oath of loyalty to Queen Anne or, later, King George. Thus were fifty years of nearly uninterrupted conflict to start, which were only to be punctuated by the expulsion of the Acadians.Parkman, p.135  Father Rale's War  Raid on Canso (1718) - The Squirrel Affair = In the lead up to Father Rale's War, shortly after Cyprian Southack established himself at Shelburne, Nova Scotia (1715), the Mi'kmaq raided the station and burned it to the ground. In response, on 17‚Äì24 September 1718, Southack led a raid on Canso and Chedabucto (present-day community of Guysborough) in what became known as the Squirrel Affair. Southack laid siege for three days to Fort St. Louis at Chedabucto, which was defended primarily by Acadians under Acadian Bernard LaSonde. There were approximately 300 Acadians in the area. On board HMS Squirrel, Smart held a number of Frenchmen, including Bernard Marres dit La Sonde, Captain Darguibes, the French fishing admiral, and Sieur Dominice, a Basque captain. On 23 September, Smart and Southack pillaged Canso. The pillaged goods were then loaded onto several French ships that had been captured in the harbor. The following day, 24 September, Southack released the Acadian prisoners, with the exception of Bernard Marres dit La Sonde, onto the Canso Islands without any provisions or clothing.Campbell, p. 132 Others fled to Isle Madame and Petit-de-Grat, Nova Scotia.Robinson, p. 53; He seized two French ships, and encouraged Governor of Nova Scotia Richard Philipps to build Fort William Augustus at Canso. During Father Rale's War, the Maliseet raided numerous New England vessels on the Bay of Fundy while the Mi‚Äôkmaq, helped by Acadians, raided Canso, Nova Scotia (1723). Much of the conflict of this war happened along the Acadia-New England border. A priest, Father Sebastian Rale and Wabanaki Confederacy members from Acadia also participated in the 1723, 1724 campaigns along the border against the British, who had long threatened to remove the Acadians because they would not take an oath of loyalty. Even during Father Le Loutre's War some twenty years later, the British talked of deporting the Acadians who would not swear loyalty to Britain. On 28 December 1720, in London, someone in the House of Lords said: \\"It seems as though the French in Nova Scotia will never be good British subjects to her Majesty ... This is why we believe that they should be expulsed as soon as the necessary forces, which will be sent to Nova Scotia, are ready.\\"  King George's War  Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744) = (Metis) Acadian Man. During King George's War, Abbe Jean-Louis Le Loutre led an insurrection consisting of Acadians and Mi‚Äôkmaq to recapture the capital in the Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744). Acadian Fran√ßois Dupont Duvivier, who had led the Canso raid, led the second siege attempt against Fort Anne, with a force of 200 troops. Grand Pre had been the staging ground for the French and Mi‚Äôkmaw sieges of Annapolis Royal.Bates, p. 33, 41 Two Minas inhabitants, Armand Bigeau and Joseph LeBlanc dit Le Maigre, had traded with Louisbourg and assisted the supplying of Duvivier's forces by sea. Both transported Duvivier's force from Louisbourg to Baie Verte and then accompanied the expedition to Annapolis Royal and had served as scoutes and couriers. Duvivier arrived at Fort Anne on September 6, 1744. The first night he erected shelters. He used Joseph-Nicolas Gautier's house for his Headquarters.Bernard, p. 70 After both sieges, Gorham demanded to take control of Grand Pre. The British burned the dwellings of both Bigeau and 'Le Maigre' at Minas. In Annapolis, they burned the home of Gautier and imprisoning him and his family at Fort Anne until they escaped after 10 months. The British also burned the homes of Acadian pilots Paul Doucett and Charles Pelerain. During the siege of 1745, the French officer Marin was required to withdraw from siege to protect Louisbourg from a British attack. He reported that upon hearing the news of Louisbourg and his own withdrawal from Annapolis Royal, the Acadians were \\"overpowered with grief from the apprehension of remaining in the disposition of the enemy\\". Marin had taken British prisoners at Annapolis and remained with them in the bay at Cobequid, where an Acadian said that the French soldiers should have \\"left their [the British] carcasses behind and brought their skins\\". The British officer also deemed there was enough evidence to hold Gautier's wife and Charles Raymond for collaborating with the siege. After the Siege of Louisbourg (1745), the Wabanaki Confederacy members from Acadia conducted a campaign against British civilians along the New England/ Acadia border. (Such campaigns were repeated in 1746 and 1747). After the first Siege of Louisbourg (1745), the British deported thousands of \\"French Colonists\\" on √éle-Royale to France.Johnston, A.J.B. Storied Shores. University College of Cape Breton Press. 2004., p. 70 There were Acadians among those deported. At the same time, in July 1745, the other English detachment landed at Port-la-Joye. Under the command of Joseph de Pont Duvivier, the French had a garrison of 20 French troops (Compagnies Franches de la Marine) at Port-la-Joye.Harvey, p. 110 The troops fled and New Englanders burned the capital to the ground. Duvivier and the twenty men retreated up the Northeast River (Hillsborough River), pursued by the New Englanders until the French troops received reinforcements from the Acadian militia and the Mi‚Äôkmaq.Harvey, p. 111 The French troops and their allies were able to drive the New Englanders to their boats, nine New Englanders killed, wounded or made prisoner. The New Englanders took six Acadian hostages, who would be executed if the Acadians or Mi‚Äôkmaq rebelled against New England control. = Siege of Port Toulouse = During the Siege of Port Toulouse, on May 2, 1745, Pepperell sent Jeremiah Moulton with 70 soldiers and two vessels to capture the fortified village of Port Toulouse. The New Englanders were only able to capture a single sloop and burn a few houses before being repelled by the French soldiers, Acadians and Mi‚Äôkmaq. They wounded three New Englanders when they were retreating. Eight days later, on May 10, the New Englanders returned with a force four times larger ‚Äì 270 men. They burned every standing structure at Port Toulouse, demolished the fort, and desecrated a cemetery where Mi‚Äôkmaq were buried. Some French were killed in the assault and others were taken prisoner.Johnson, p. 68 After the failure of the French Duc d'Anville Expedition to recapture Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia Governor Paul Mascarene told Acadians to avoid \\"deluding Hopes of Returning under the Dominion of France\\". One French officer noted that when the French troops withdrew from Annapolis Royal, the Acadians were alarmed and disappointed, and felt they were being abandoned to British retribution. The following year, Acadians helped the French to destroy British troops in the Battle of Grand Pr√©. = Battle of Grand Pre = Broussard and other Acadians supported the French soldiers in the Battle of Grand Pr√©. Ramezay elicited more support from the Acadians, enjoyed more of their collaboration, than the other enterprises. He reported to have enlisted 25 Acadians from Piziquid to Grand Pre ready to bear arms. (Some Acadians may not have supported French efforts in Acadia. Louis Li√©nard de Beaujeu de Villemond stated in his journal that while the Canadian troops were passing several villages near present day Truro, Captain Coulon on his approach march to the battle sent a detachment of troops at \\"daybreak to Copequit to block all the paths because the ill intentioned inhabitants could undertake to pass and alert the English to our march\\". Captain Charles Morris reported the French were supported by \\"... about 100 of the Neutral French join'd with them\\".Charles Morris. A Brief Survey of Nova Scotia. The Royal Artillery Regimental Library, Woolwich. A copy of the original is held at the Library & Archives of Canada, Ottawa. Charles Morris fonds (circa 1748)R2227-0-6-E As well, local intelligence pinpointed Noble's billets with stunning accuracy. Near the end of the battle Morris spied an enemy group \\"clothed like the Inhabitants whom afterward we were inform'd they were, they were all arm'd & having assisted the enemy in the night they were getting off to prevent discovery but unluckily passing into the woods came in full sight of us.\\" The French fleet movements in Nova Scotia waters before the massacre enjoyed the help of Acadian pilots, including Nicholas Gautier and his two sons. = Louisbourg = After the fall of Louisbourg, in conjunction with Father Charles Germain and Joseph Marin de la Malgue, Acadian and Mi'kmaw militias (40 Acadians and 100 Mi'kmaq) from Tatamagouche repeatedly attacked the British who were occupying the fort and the prevent any British settlements from being established in Acadia.  Father Le Loutre's War  Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre - \\"the soul of the Acadian resistance.\\" Within 18 months of establishing Halifax, and the start of Father Le Loutre's War, the British took firm control of the Nova Scotia peninsula by building fortifications in all the major Acadian communities: present-day Windsor (Fort Edward); Grand Pr√© (Fort Vieux Logis) and Chignecto (Fort Lawrence). A British fort already existed at the other major Acadian centre of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia and Cobequid remained without a fort. Le Loutre is reported to have said that \\"the English might build as many Forts as they pleased but he wou'd take care that they shou'd not come out of them, for he was resolved to torment them with his Indians....\\"Patterson, 1993, p. 47 Richard Bulkeley wrote that between 1749 and 1755, Nova Scotia \\"was kept in an uninterrupted state of war by the Acadians ... and the reports of an officer commanding Fort Edward (Nova Scotia), [indicated he] could not be conveyed [to Halifax] with less an escort than an officer and thirty men.\\" The Mi‚Äôkmaq attacked New England Rangers in the Siege of Grand Pre and Battle at St. Croix. Upon the founding of Halifax (1749), Acadians and Mi‚Äôkmaq conducted twelve raids on the capital region; the most significant raid was the one in 1751 on Dartmouth. They also resisted the initial British occupation of Chignecto (1750) and later fought against them in the Battle of Beausejour (1755). Throughout Father Le Loutre's War, English speakers began calling the Acadians \\"French neutral\\", a label that would remain in common use through the 1750s. British people used the term sarcastically in derision. This stance led to the Acadians becoming known at times as the \\"neutral French\\".R. Douglas Francis, Richard Jones, and Donald B. Smith, Origins: Canadian History to Confederation, 6th ed. (Toronto: Nelson Education, 2009), 117 In 1749, Governor Cornwallis again asked the Acadians to take the oath and although he was unsuccessful, he took no drastic action against them. The following governor, Peregrine Hopson, continued the conciliatory policy towards the Acadians.John Brebner, New England's Outpost: Acadia before the Conquest of Canada, (Hamden, CT: Archon Books, 1965), 190. = Acadian Exodus = During the war, Acadians revealed their political allegiance by leaving mainland Nova Scotia. From 1749-55, there was massive Acadian migration out of British- occupied mainland Nova Scotia and into French-occupied √éle Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island), √éle Royale (Cape Breton) and present-day New Brunswick. A prominent Acadian who transported Acadians to √éle St. Jean and √éle Royal was Joseph-Nicolas Gautier. While some Acadians were forced to leave, for others the act of leaving British-occupied territory for French-occupied territory was an act of resistance to the British occupation.A.J.B. Johnston. \\"French Attitudes Toward the Acadians, ca. 1680‚Äì1756\\", In Du Grand D√©rangement √† la D√©portation. pp. 152 On one occasion, when a British naval patrol intercepted Acadians in a vessel en route to √éle St. Jean, an Acadian passenger said, \\"They chose rather to quit their lands and estates than possess them upon the terms propos'd by the English [sic] governor.\\" The leader of the Exodus was Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre, whom the British gave the code name \\"Moses\\". Historian Micheline Johnson described Le Loutre as \\"the soul of the Acadian resistance.\\" = Battle at Chignecto (1750) = Le Loutre retrieved this bell from the Beaubassin church during the Battle at Chignecto (1750): (Le Loutre retrieved the bell again from the Beausejour Cathedral during the Battle of Beausejour) In May 1750, Lawrence was unsuccessful in getting a base at Chignecto because Le Loutre burned the village of Beaubassin, preventing Lawrence from using its supplies to establish a fort. (According to the historian Frank Patterson, the Acadians at Cobequid also burned their homes as they retreated from the British to Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia in 1754.Frank Harris Patterson. History of Tatamagouche, Halifax: Royal Print & Litho., 1917 (also Mika, Belleville: 1973), p. 19) Lawrence retreated, but he returned in September 1750. On September 3, Rous, Lawrence and Gorham led over 700 men to Chignecto, where Mi‚Äôkmaq and Acadians opposed their landing. They killed twenty British, who in turn killed several Mi‚Äôkmaq. Le Loutre's militia eventually withdrew, burning the rest of the Acadians' crops and houses as they went. Le Loutre and the Acadian militia leader Joseph Broussard resisted the British assault. The British troops defeated the resistance and began construction of Fort Lawrence near the site of the ruins of Beaubassin.Hand, p. 20 The work on the fort proceeded rapidly and they completed the facility within weeks. To limit the British to peninsular Nova Scotia, the French also began to fortify the Chignecto and its approaches; they constructed Fort Beausejour and two satellite forts: one at present-day Port Elgin, New Brunswick (Fort Gaspareaux) and the other at present-day Saint John, New Brunswick (Fort Menagoueche).Hand, p. 25 During these months, 35 Mi‚Äôkmaq and Acadians ambushed Ranger Captain Francis Bartelo, killing him and six of his men while taking seven others captive. The Mi‚Äôkmaq conducted ritual torture of the captives throughout the night, which had a chilling effect on the New Englanders. = Siege of Grand Pre = On November 27, 1749, in the Siege of Grand Pre, 300 Mi‚Äôkmaq, Maliseet, Penobscot and Acadians attacked Fort Vieux Logis at Grand Pre. The fort was under the command of Captain Handfield of the Cornwallis' Regiment. The Native and Acadian militia killed the sentrys (guards) who were firing on them.Brebner, New England's Outpost. p. 174 The Natives then captured Lieutenant John Hamilton and eighteen soldiers under his command (including Handfield's son), while surveying the fort's environs. After the capture of the British soldiers, the native and Acadian militias made several attempts over the next week to lay siege to the fort before breaking off the engagement. When Gorham‚Äôs Rangers arrived the militia had already departed with the prisoners to Chignecto.See ; Griffith 392; ; ; John Salusbury's Diary, Dec. 10, 1749; and ). The Acadians were then involved in the Battle at St. Croix, where one of them was killed.https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092547116;view=1up;seq=461 = Raid on Dartmouth (1751) = British erect a wooden palisade along Dartmouth in response to the Raid, opposite side of the harbour from the Great Pontack (Lower left corner), present-day Historic Properties The Raid on Dartmouth occurred during Father Le Loutre's War on May 13, 1751 when an Acadian and Mi‚Äôkmaw militia from Chignecto, under the command of Acadian Joseph Broussard, raided Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, destroying the town and killing twenty British villagers. On May 13, 1751 before sunrise, Broussard led sixty Mi'kmaq and Acadians to attack Dartmouth again, in what would be known as the \\"Dartmouth Massacre\\".Atkins, p. 27‚Äì28 Broussard and the others killed twenty settlers and more were taken prisoner. This raid was one of seven the Natives and Acadians would conduct against the town during the war. The British retaliated by sending several armed companies to Chignecto. A few French defenders were killed and the dikes were breached. Hundreds of acres of crops were ruined, which was disastrous for the Acadians and the French troops. Immediately after the raid, a wooden palisade was erected around the town plot.Harry Chapman, p. 31 Mi'kmaw and Acadian attacks continued throughout the French and Indian War, which ended fourteen years after Dartmouth was first settled. (For example, in the spring of 1759, there was another attack on Fort Clarence, in which five soldiers were killed.)Harry Chapman, p. 32; After the initial raid, no new settlers were placed in Dartmouth again for the next thirty years. Of the 151 settlers who arrived in Dartmouth in August 1750, only half remained two years later. By the end of war (1763), Dartmouth was only left with 78 settlers.Harry Chapman, p. 32 Acadians exerted their political resistance by refusing to trade with the British. By 1754, the Acadians sent no produce to the Halifax market. When British merchants tried to buy directly from the Acadians, they were refused. Acadians also refused to supply Fort Edward with firewood. Lawrence saw the need to neutralize the Acadian military threat. To defeat Louisbourg, the British destroyed the lines of supply by deporting the Acadians.;  French and Indian War  Charles Deschamps de Boish√©bert et de Raffetot In 1753, French troops from Canada marched south and seized and fortified the Ohio Valley. Britain protested the invasion and claimed Ohio for itself. On May 28, 1754, the French and Indian War (the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War) began with the Battle of Jumonville Glen. French Officer Ensign de Jumonville and a third of his escort was killed by a British patrol led by George Washington. In retaliation the French and the Indians defeated the British at Fort Necessity. Washington lost a third of his force, and surrendered. Major General Edward Braddock's troops were defeated in the Battle of the Monongahela, and William Johnson's troops stopped the French advance at Lake George. In Acadia, the primary British objective was to defeat the French fortifications at Beausejour and Louisbourg. The British saw the Acadians' allegiance to the French and the Wabanaki Confederacy as a military threat. Father Le Loutre's War had created the conditions for total war; British civilians had not been spared and, as Governor Charles Lawrence and the Nova Scotia Council saw it, Acadian civilians had provided intelligence, sanctuary, and logistical support while others had fought against the British. After the British capture of Beausejour, the plan to capture Louisbourg included cutting trade to the Fortress in order to weaken the Fortress and, in turn, weaken the French ability to supply the Mi'kmaq in their warfare against the British. According to Historian Stephen Patterson, more than any other single factor‚Äîincluding the massive assault that eventually forced the surrender of Louisbourg‚Äîthe supply problem brought an end to French power in the region. Lawrence realized he could reduce the military threat and weaken Fortress Louisbourg by deporting the Acadians, thus cutting off supplies to the fort. During the Expulsion, French Officer Charles Deschamps de Boish√©bert led the Mi'kmaq and the Acadians in a guerrilla war against the British. According to Louisbourg account books, by late 1756 the French had regularly dispensed supplies to 700 natives. From 1756 to the fall of Louisbourg in 1758, the French made regular payments to Chief Jean-Baptiste Cope and other natives for British scalps. = Battle of Petitcodiac = Battle of Petitcodiac Charles Deschamps de Boish√©bert was a French militia commander who became a resistance leader. Based in the Miramichi River valley, he helped Acadians fleeing the British deportation operations escape to Quebec. After the fall of Beausejour, Monckton sent a naval squaldorn to evict him from the satellite fort at the mouth of the Saint John River. Knowing that he could not defend his position, Bosishebert destroyed the fort. When he received word that the British were planning an expedition to the Petitcodiac River, he hurried to Chipoudy, where he organized 120 Acadians, Maliseets and Mi'kmaq into a guerrilla fighting force.; ; On September 2, the expedition began these clearing operations on settlements in and around the Village-des- Blanchard. While the main body worked on the eastern bank of the river, a detachment of fifty or sixty under John Indicot was despatched to the western bank. When they set fire to the village church, Boish√©bert and three hundred men attacked. The British retreated behind a dyke and were in a near panic when Frye landed with the remainder of the force and took command. After three hours of spirited fighting, Frye eventually extracted the force to the boats and retreated. Twenty two British were killed and another six were wounded. Ranger Joseph Gorham was wounded in the battle. = Battle of Bloody Creek = Battle of Bloody Creek (1757) monument Led by Acadian William Johnson (Guillaume Jeanson), a group of Mi'kmaq and Acadians attacked the British force in the Battle of Bloody Creek. Marching on foot along the south shore of the Annapolis River, the British force was exposed to wet and cold before giving up their search for the prisoners. They were crossing a bridge on the Ren√© For√™t River on the morning of December 8 when the Mi'kmaq and Acadians attacked. The British made a brief stand and suffered a high number of casualties, including Captain Pigou, before retreating back to Annapolis Royal. On another occasion, 226 Acadians (36 families) being deported from Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia on the ship Pembroke rebelled against the British crew. After fighting off an attack by another British vessel on February 9, 1756, the Acadians took 8 British prisoners to Quebec. = Raids on Piziquid (Fort Edward) = In December 1755, Acadian and Mi'kmaw militia repeated attacked British troops working to kill their livestock, killing one workman which left the others to flee to Halifax. In September 1756, a group of 100 Acadians ambushed a party of thirteen soldiers who were working outside the fort. Seven were taken prisoner and six escaped back to the fort.Boston Evening Post. 1756 October 18. p. 2 In April 1757, a band of Acadian and Mi'kmaq raided a warehouse near Fort Edward, killing thirteen British soldiers. After loading with what provisions they could carry, they set fire to the building. A few days later, the same partisans also raided Fort Cumberland. Because of the strength of the Acadian militia and Mi'kmaw militia, British officer John Knox wrote that \\"In the year 1757 we were said to be Masters of the province of Nova Scotia, or Acadia, which, however, was only an imaginary possession.\\" He continues to state that the situation in the province was so precarious for the British that the \\"troops and inhabitants\\" at Fort Edward, Fort Sackville and Lunenburg \\"could not be reputed in any other light than as prisoners.\\" = Raids on Chignecto (Fort Cumberland) = The Acadians and Mi‚Äôkmaq also resisted in the Chignecto region. They were victorious in the Battle of Petitcodiac (1755). In the spring of 1756, a wood- gathering party from Fort Monckton (former Fort Gaspareaux), was ambushed and nine were scalped.Webster as cited by bluepete, p. 371 In the summer of 1756, Boishebert burned an English vessel at Bay Vert, killing seven and taking one prisoner. In April 1757, after raiding Fort Edward, the same band of Acadian and Mi'kmaw partisans raided Fort Cumberland, killing and scalping two men and taking two prisoners. July 20, 1757 Mi'kmaq killed 23 and captured two of Gorham's rangers outside Fort Cumberland near present-day Jolicure, New Brunswick.; New Brunswick Military Project In March 1758, forty Acadian and Mi'kmaq attacked a schooner at Fort Cumberland and killed its master and two sailors. In the winter of 1759, the Mi'kmaq ambushed five British soldiers on patrol while they were crossing a bridge near Fort Cumberland. They were ritually scalped and their bodies mutilated as was common in frontier warfare. During the night of April 4, 1759, using canoes, a force of Acadians and French captured the transport. At dawn they attacked the ship Moncton and chased it for five hours down the Bay of Fundy. Although the Moncton escaped, its crew suffered one killed and two wounded.New Brunswick Military Project = Raids on Lawrencetown = Eastern Battery Plaque, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia By June 1757, the settlers had to be withdrawn completely from the settlement of Lawrencetown (established 1754) because the number of Indian raids eventually prevented settlers from leaving their houses. In nearby Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, in the spring of 1759, there was another Mi'kmaq attack on Eastern Battery, in which five soldiers were killed. (In the same year, further east at Canso, Acadians took 3 British vessels.) = Lunenburg Campaign = The Lunenburg Campaign (1758) was executed by the Mi'kmaw militia and Acadian militia against the Foreign Protestants who the British had settled on the Lunenburg Peninsula during the French and Indian War. The British deployed Joseph Gorham and his Rangers along with Captain Rudolf Faesch and regular troops of the 60th Regiment of Foot to defend Lunenburg.\\"Regular\\" refers to a professional British soldier, paid by the British Crown. The Campaign was so successful, by November of 1758, the members of the House of Assembly for Lunenburg stated \\"they received no benefit from His Majesty's Troops or Rangers\\" and required more protection. = Raids on Maine = In present-day Maine, the Mi‚Äôkmaq and the Maliseet raided numerous New England villages. At the end of April 1755, they raided Gorham, Maine, killing two men and a family. Next they appeared in New-Boston (Gray) and through the neighbouring towns destroying the plantations. On May 13, they raided Frankfort (Dresden), where two men were killed and a house burned. The same day they raided Sheepscot (Newcastle), and took five prisoners. Two were killed in North Yarmouth on May 29 and one taken captive. They shot one person at Teconnet. They took prisoners at Fort Halifax; two prisoners taken at Fort Shirley (Dresden). They took two captive at New Gloucester as they worked on the local fort.William Williamson. The history of the state of Maine. Vol. 2. 1832. p. 311‚Äì112; During this time period, the Maliseet and Mi'kmaq were the only tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy who were able to right. On 13 August 1758 Boishebert left Miramichi, New Brunswick with 400 soldiers, including Acadians whom he led from Port Toulouse. They marched to Fort St George (Thomaston, Maine). His detachment reached there on 9 September but was caught in an ambush and had to withdraw. They next went to Munduncook (Friendship, Maine). They wounded eight British settlers and killed others. This was Boish√©bert's last Acadian expedition. From there, Boishebert and the Acadians went to Quebec and fought in the Battle of Quebec (1759). ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ William Durkee Williamson, The history of the state of Maine: from its first discovery, A.D. ..., Volume 2, p. 333 (Williamson's Book) = Raids on Halifax = On 2 April 1756, Mi'kmaq received payment from the Governor of Quebec for 12 British scalps taken at Halifax.J. S. McLennan. Louisbourg: From its foundation to its fall (1713‚Äì1758). 1918, p. 190 Acadian Pierre Gautier, son of Joseph-Nicolas Gautier, led Mi‚Äôkmaw warriors from Louisbourg on three raids against Halifax in 1757. In each raid, Gautier took prisoners or scalps or both. The last raid happened in September and Gautier went with four Mi‚Äôkmaq and killed and scalped two British men at the foot of Citadel Hill. (Pierre went on to participate in the Battle of Restigouche.)Earle Lockerby. \\"Pre-Deportation Letters from Ile Saint Jean\\". Les Cahiers. La Societe historique acadienne. Vol. 42, No. 2. June 2011. pp. 99‚Äì100 Arriving on the provincial vessel King George, four companies of Rogers Rangers (500 rangers) were at Dartmouth April 8 until May 28 awaiting the Siege of Louisbourg (1758). While there they scoured the woods to stop raids on the capital. In July 1759, Mi'kmaq and Acadians kill five British in Dartmouth, opposite McNabb's Island. = Siege of Louisbourg (1758) = Acadian militias participated in the defence of Louisbourg in 1757 and 1758. In preparation of a British assault on Louisbourg in 1757, all the tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy were present including Acadian militia. Without any result from their efforts, the number of Mi‚Äôkmaq and Acadians who showed the following year were much lower. The precedent for such a decline in numbers was set in the two attacks that happened in the Siege of Annapolis 1744, the Mi‚Äôkmaq and Acadians appearing in much less numbers for the second assault after the first one had failed. New Englanders came ashore at Pointe Platee (Flat Point) during the Siege of 1745. In 1757 and again in 1758, the Natives and Acadian militias were stationed at the potential landing beaches of Pointe Platee and one further away Anse d la Cormorandiere (Kennington Cove). In the Siege of Louisbourg (1758), Acadian and Mi‚Äôkmaw militias began to arrive in Louisboug around May 7, 1758. By the end of the month 118 Acadians arrived and about 30 Mi‚Äôkmaq from Ile St. Jean and the Miramachi. Boishebert arrived in June with 70 more Acadia militia members from Ile St. Jean and 60 Mi‚Äôkmaw militia. On June 2, The British vessels arrived and the militias went to their defensive positions on the shore. The 200 British vessels waited for six days, until the weather conditions were right, before they attacked on June 8. Four companies of Rogers Rangers under the command of George Scott were the first to come ashore in advance of James Wolfe. The British came ashore at Anse de la Cormorandiere and \\"continuous fire was poured upon the invaders\\". The Mi'kmaw and Acadian militias fought the Rangers until the latter were supported by Scott and James Wolfe, which led to the militias retreat. Seventy of the militia were captured and 50 others scalped. The Mi'kmaw and Acadian militias killed 100 British, some of whom were wounded and drowned. On June 16, 50 Mi'kmaq returned to the cove and took 5 seaman captive, firing at the other British marines. On July 15, Boishebert arrived with Acadian and Mi'kmaw militias and attacked Captain Sutherland and the Rogers Rangers posted at Northeast harbour. When Scott and Wolfe's reinforcements arrived, 100 Rangers from McCurdey and Brewer's Companies were sent to track them down. They only captured one Mi'kmaw. (From here the Rangers went on to conduct the St. John River Campaign, in part, hoping to capture Boishebert.) = Cape Breton = Soon after the Siege of Louisbourg, Major Dalling went with 30 of James Rogers rangers to Spanish Bay (Sydney, Nova Scotia) and took Acadians prisoner. James Rogers' company made a raid on an Acadian village on the Bras d'Or Lake and \\"flushed out\\" 18 armed Acadian militia fighters and 100 other men, women and children. In May 1759, the Mi‚Äôkmaw militia were making raids on Louisbourg and on June 1, the four companies of Rogers‚Äô Rangers and the Mi‚Äôkmaq fought a \\"hot skimmish\\" until they eventually retreated. = St. John River Campaign = Acadia militias resisted during the St. John River Campaign and the Petitcodiac River Campaign. The Acadian militia along the St. John River was led by Acadian Joseph Godin dit Bellefontaine, Sieur de Beaus√©jour, who had led the militias since 1749. The command at Fort Frederick was not convinced the village was totally destroyed and sent at least three more expeditions up river to Ste Anne between July and September 1759. The soldiers captured some Acadians along the way, burned their homes, destroyed their crops and slaughtered their cattle. The September expedition involved more than 90 men. At present-day French Lake on the Oromocto River, they met fierce resistance from the Acadians, and resulted in the death of at least seven rangers.; Campbell, p. 31 (note that Campbell reports five rangers killed and eight wounded) On 18 February 1759, Lieutenant Hazen and 22 men arrived at Sainte- Anne des Pays-Bas. They pillaged and burned the village of 147 buildings, including two Mass-houses and all of the barns and stables. They burned a large store-house, and with it a large quantity of hay, wheat, peas, oats, etc., killing 212 horses, about 5 head of cattle, a large number of hogs and so forth. They also burned the church (located just west of Old Government House, Fredericton). Only a handful of Acadians were found in the area, most had already fled north with their families.; Major Joseph Godin dit Bellefontaine and a group of Acadians ambushed the Rangers. The rangers scalped six Acadians and took six prisoners during this raid. Major Joseph Godin dit Bellefontaine, Sieur de Beaus√©jour (Seigneur of Pointe Ste-Anne) was Commander of the Acadian Militia of the St-John River valley. During the Seven Years' War he supported and encouraged the Indians in their opposition to the British and even led some of their war parties. In February 1759, they killed Godin's daughter and three of his grandchildren in front of him. = Petiticodiac Campaign = In June 1758, Lieutenant Meech of Benoni Danks' Rangers along with fifty-five men advanced up the Petitcodiac River, suspecting that this was where the Acadian and Mi‚Äôkmaw raids originated. They made contact with 40 Acadians but were unable to catch them. On July 1, 1758, Danks himself began to pursue the Acadians. They arrived at present day Moncton and Danks‚Äô Rangers ambushed about thirty Acadians, who were led by Joseph Broussard (Beausoleil). Many were driven into the river, three of them were killed and scalped, and others were captured. Broussard was seriously wounded.; In September 1758, Rogers Rangers burned a village of 100 buildings. The Acadians captured five of the British troops and retreated with then to the Miramachi. The Acadians took prisoner William Caesar McCormick of William Stark's rangers and his detachment of three rangers and two light infantry privates from the 35th Regiment. They were taken to Miramachi and then Restogouch. (They were kept by Pierre du Calvet who later released them to Halifax.) November 12, 1758, Danks' Rangers sailed up the river and returned the next day with four men and twelve women and children as prisoners. The prisoners notified Danks about the location of Joseph Broussard's home (present day Boundary Creek). Danks' company sailed immediately up the Petitodiac to attack Broussard's home. By the time Danks arrived the house was vacant. Danks killed the livestock and burned the fields and village. The Rangers returned to the river. Captain Silvanus Cobb continued to ferry Rangers up and down the river to destroy the houses and crops over two nights, November 13‚Äì14. On November 14, Acadian resistance appeared early in the morning. Two of Danks' Rangers were missing. The Rangers overwhelmed the Acadians once Danks' reinforcement of a platoon of Rangers arrived. The Rangers took a dozen women and children hostage. Joseph Gorham reported that he had burned over a hundred homes and Danks reported he destroyed twenty three buildings. The Rangers then returned to Fort Frederick at the mouth of the St. John River with the prisoners. = Plains of Abraham = Under command of Boish√©bert, the Acadian militia (150 fighters) took part in the defence of Quebec during the summer of 1759 and then in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759). In the winter he returned for the last time to Acadia, to gather reinforcements for the defence of Canada and to restore the morale of the discouraged Acadians. = Battle of Restigouche = An Acadian militia and Mi‚Äôkmaw militia, totalling 1500 fighters, organized in the Battle of Restigouche. The Acadians arrived in about 20 schooners and small boats. Along with the French, they continued up river to draw the British fleet closer to the Acadian community of Pointe-√†-la-Batterie, where they were ready to launch a surprise attack on the English. The Acadians sunk a number of their vessels to create a blockade, upon which the Acadian and Mi‚Äôkmaq fired at the ships. On 27 June, the British succeeded in maneuvering just beyond the chain of sunken ships. Once the British were range of the battery, they fired on the battery. This skirmish lasted all night and was repeated with various breaks from 28 June to 3 July, when the British overwhelmed Pointe √† la Batterie, burning 150 to 200 buildings that made up the Acadian village community at Pointe √† la Batterie. The militias retreated and re-grouped with the French frigate Machault. They sunk more schooners to create another blockade. They created two new batteries, one on the north shore at Pointe de la Mission (today Listuguj, Quebec), and one on the south shore at Pointe aux Sauvages (today Campbellton, New Brunswick). They created blockade with schooners at Pointe aux Sauvages. On July 7 British commander Byron spent the day getting rid of the battery at Pointe aux Sauvages and later returned to the task of destroying the Machault. By the morning of 8 July the Scarborough and the Repulse were in range of the blockade and face to face with the Machault. The British made two attempts to defeat the batteries and the militias held out. On the third attempt, they were successful. Treaty of Paris (1763) The fifty years of quasi-uninterrupted hostilities on the Acadian territory were finally resolved by the Treaty of Paris (1763), in which the French were expelled from British North America; they retained only a small portion of Louisiana on that continent. The fate of the Acadians‚Äîexpulsion from their homelands‚Äîwas due to their reliance on their clerics, who employed them mercilessly as tools of a failed policy of empire. As Vaudreuil remarked in 1760 to his superior, \\"Les malheurs des Accadiens sont beaucoup moins leur ouvrage que le fruit des sollicitations et des demarches des missionnaires.\\" Thomas Pichon would write in his Lettres et Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire du Cap Breton that same year:  American Revolution  In the lead up to the American Revolution, Nova Scotia prepared for an American assault. A militia of 100 Acadians from Clare and Yarmouth was raised and marched to Halifax (1774).Akins, Thomas. History of Halifax City, p. 73 Simon Thibodeau fought the American patriots while in Quebec during the American Revolution. The Capture of Fort Bute signalled the opening of Spanish intervention in the American Revolutionary War on the side of France and the United States. Mustering an ad hoc army of Spanish regulars, Acadian militia, and native levies under Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent, Bernardo de G√°lvez, the Governor of Spanish Louisiana stormed and captured the small British frontier post on Bayou Manchac on 7 September 1779. ‚Ä¢ War of 1812 L√©vite Th√©riault Jean-Baptiste H√©bert and Jean-Joseph Girouard served in the War of 1812. L√©vite Th√©riault was the founder and lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Battalion of Madawaska militia in New Brunswick. Urbain Johnson was a captain of a militia in New Brunswick. No√´l H√©bert also served in a militia in Canada East. Henri M. Robicheau and Frederick A. Robicheau served as captains of local militias in Nova Scotia. Charles Cormier was a militia leader in Montreal. American Civil War During the American Civil War, in Louisiana there were numerous Cajun militia units raised in the Army of the Confederacy. One unit was named \\"Independent Rangers of Iberville Squadron Militia Cavalry\\", after Acadian war hero Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville.  World War I  During World War I, Acadians participated in the 165th Battalion (Acadiens), CEF, a unit in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Based in Moncton, New Brunswick, the unit began recruiting in late 1915 throughout the Maritime provinces. After sailing to England in March 1917, the battalion was absorbed into the 13th Reserve Battalion on 7 April 1917. World War II LCAs During World War II, Acadian soldiers were instrumental in the Battle of Normandy and the liberation of Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados, in which they are named by the Br√®che des Acadiens. Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer is located at the eastern end of Nan Sector of Juno Beach, one of the landing sites on D-Day, at the beginning of the Battle of Normandy, during World War II. On D-Day the infantry of the North Shore Regiment of New Brunswick landed there, and were backed up by the armour of the Fort Garry Horse (also known as the 10th Armoured Regiment). Le R√©giment de la Chaudi√®re of Quebec came ashore in reserve. About 100 defenders garrisoned the town and they were largely unaffected by the preparatory barrage. As such they were able to put up heavy resistance at the beach and in the town as the Canadians pushed inland, but were eventually overcome.

Following the religious strife of the seventeenth century and the passing of penal laws in 1695, celebrating Catholic mass in Ireland became a dangerous practice for priest and congregation. Isolated and secluded sites were selected for worship, and natural rocks and boulders often came to be used as an altar or Mass rock. It is often through local knowledge that their locations are still identifiable. The practice of celebrating mass in such fashion was in decline by the middle of the eighteenth century, when many Catholics worshipped in thatched 'mass-houses'. According to Hartnett (1939) it was a 'sort of ledge or stone altar', located at the foot of Carrigacnubber rock, where Mass was said to have been celebrated in Penal times.

There are many different forms of reflectometry. They can be classified in several ways: by the used radiation (electromagnetic, ultrasound, particle beams), by the geometry of wave propagation (unguided versus wave guides or cables), by the involved length scales (wavelength and penetration depth versus size of the investigated object), by the method of measurement (continuous versus pulsed, polarization resolved, ...), and by the application domain.  Used radiation  Electromagnetic radiation of widely varying wavelength is used in many different forms of reflectometry: * Radar and Lidar: Reflections of electromagnetic pulses are used to detect the presence and to measure the location and speed of objects like aircraft, missiles, ships, cars. * Characterization of Semiconductor and Dielectric Thin Films: Analysis of reflectance data utilizing the Forouhi Bloomer dispersion equations can determine the thickness, refractive index, and extinction coefficient of thin films utilized in the semiconductor industry. * X-ray reflectometry: is a surface-sensitive analytical technique used in chemistry, physics, and materials science to characterize surfaces, thin films and multilayers. Propagation of electric pulses in cables is used to detect and localize defects in electric wiring. Ultrasonic reflectometry: A transducer generates ultrasonic waves which propagates until it reaches the interface between the propagation medium and the sample. The wave is partially reflected at the interface and partially transmitted into the sample. The waves reflected at the interface travel back to the transducer, then the impedance of a sample is determined by measuring the amplitude of the wave reflected from the propagation medium/sample interface. From the reflected wave, it is possible to determine some properties of the sample that is desired to characterize. Applications include medical ultrasonography and nondestructive testing. Neutron reflectometry: is a neutron diffraction technique for measuring the structure of thin films, similar to the often complementary techniques of X-ray reflectivity and ellipsometry. The technique provides valuable information over a wide variety of scientific and technological applications including chemical aggregation, polymer and surfactant adsorption, structure of thin film magnetic systems, biological membranes. Skin reflectance: In anthropology, reflectometry devices are often used to gauge human skin color through the measurement of skin reflectance. These devices are typically pointed at the upper arm or forehead, with the emitted waves then interpreted at various percentages. Lower frequencies represent lower skin reflectance and thus darker pigmentation, whereas higher frequencies represent greater skin reflectance and therefore lighter pigmentation.  Different reflectometry techniques  Many techniques are based on the principle of reflectometry and are distinguished by the type of waves used and the analysis of the reflected signal. Among all these techniques, we can classify the main but not limited to: * In time-domain reflectometry (TDR), one emits a train of fast pulses, and analyzes the magnitude, duration and shape of the reflected pulses. * Frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR): this technique is based on the transmission of a set of stepped-frequency sine waves from the sample. As for the TDR, these waves propagate until the sample and are reflected back to the source. Several types of FDR exist and are commonly used in radar applications or characterization of cables/wires. The signal analysis is focused rather on the changes in frequency between the incident signal and the reflected signal. * Ellipsometry is the polarization-resolved measurement of light reflections from thin films.

Of the three most northern counties of England surveyed in the Domesday Book of 1086 (Northumbria, Durham and Cumbria), only the southern band of land in the south of Cumbria was recorded. The westernmost entries for Cumbria, covering the Duddon and Furness Peninsulas are largely recorded as part of the Manor of Hougun. The entry in Domesday Book covering Hougun refers to the time (ca. 1060) when it was held by Tostig Godwinson (c. 1026 ‚Äì 25 September 1066), Earl of Northumbria. Location The exact location of Hougun has been long disputed and Millom is often suggested, although High Haume near Dalton-in-Furness has also been proposed, given that it was recorded in 1336 as Howehom. It has also been suggested that the centre of the district was Furness, and that the territory included the Millom area, plus part or all of Cartmel ‚Äì what would later be the Lancashire territory known as Amounderness. The notion that the manor of Hougun was an administrative district at all and not just the chief vill of the area has been challenged. Etymology The name itself is commonly thought to derive from the Old Norse haugr meaning mound or hill. Island of Hougun (Houganai) was also the name given to nearby Walney Island at the western end of Morecambe Bay. Standard English words which have a Scandinavian Etymology The Vikings in England. Retrieved March 25, 2016 Approximate extent of Domesday coverage : the Hougun district, if indeed it was a district, may have covered the three peninsulas to the left of the pink area  Domesday Book of 1086 The Domesday entry for Hougun is therefore significant in indicating the extent of Norman control of the north-west, probably down to 1092, when William II of England took over Carlisle and northern Cumberland. North of the Hougun district, the land was part of Strathclyde/Cumbria, under Scottish overlordship. It has been suggested that the Domesday entry offers a snapshot of the \\"transition between the Anglo-Norse and Norman worlds in the 11th century\\", and suggests a largely self-governing area with a lack of the shire and wapentake structure that prevailed further south in England.Whalley, 2018, p. 118 At some time before the shiring of Lancaster, Cumberland and Westmorland (which took place around 1157-1182), parts of the Hougun area had been split off. Furness Abbey was given the Furness peninsula; and St Bees Priory was granted land from the Norman lord of Millom around 1125.Phythian- Adams, 1996, p. 32. The Hougun entry is as follows (land is measured in carucates in the north, which is roughly the amount of land assumed to provide for one household for one year): :In Hougun Manor Earl Tosti had four carucates rateable to the geld. :In Chiluestreuic iii c., Sourebi iii c., Hietun iiii c., Daltune ii c., Warte ii c., Neutun vi c., :Walletun vi c., Suntun ii c., Fordebodele ii c., Rosse vi c., Hert ii c., Lies vi c., Alia Lies ii c., :Glassertun ii c., Steintun ii c., Clivertun iiii c., Ouregrave iii c., Meretun iiii c., Pennigetun ii c., :Gerleuuorde ii c., Borch vi c., Beretsiege iiii c., Witingham iiii c., Bodele iiii c., :Santacherche i c., Hougenai vi c..

He is known for his controversial public appearances and statements, and has been described as enfant terrible of Croatian politics. Biography He was born in Primo≈°ten. After finishing primary school in 1969 in Primo≈°ten, he went to Zagreb to study engineering, graduating high school in 1974. In the period 1976-1990 he worked as a seaman in various domestic and foreign shipping companies. In January 1990 he organized the first democratic elections in the local community of Primo≈°ten, becoming its secretary. He is a volunteer and a veteran of the Croatian War of Independence, retiring in 1995. Political career In 2001 at the local elections he organized the Independent Municipal List, becoming president of the Municipal Council of Primo≈°ten. In 2005 The resubmitted his candidacy in local elections with the Independent List, winning 80% of the seats and becoming a mayor of the municipality of Primo≈°ten. In 2009 at the local elections in Primo≈°ten he won his second consecutive term as a mayor, with the support of 80% of voters. He won his third term in 2013, with the support of 68% of voters. Since 2001 to date Petrina has been doing all of the duties in the municipality of Primo≈°ten voluntarily and free of charge. In 2009 he founded the Independent County List that has received the support of 9,500 voters, winning eight seats in the ≈†ibenik-Knin County assembly, which turned it into the second most powerful political entity in the county. in 2011 in the Italian city of Lecce he was awarded the international tourism award for contribution to the development of Primo≈°ten tourism - Lifetime Achievement Award for Tourism (Per il turismo alla carriera). Although he accused Bo≈æo Petrov, leader of the Bridge of Independent Lists (MOST), that he had a secret agreement with the conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and its leader Tomislav Karamarko on how to take over power after 2015 parliamentary election, he eventually joined MOST electoral list and was elected to the Croatian Parliament, but after ensuing months of post-election negotiations and eventual agreement between HDZ and MOST, Petrina left MOST and continued to serve as an independent MP. He ran at the 2016 extraordinary parliamentary election and came in 5th in the 9th electoral district but didn't pass the 5% threshold so he wasn't re-elected to the Parliament. At the 2017 local elections he was re-elected as mayor of Primo≈°ten, and was elected to the Assembly of the ≈†ibenik-Knin County where his councilors' club has 7 members, making it the second largest alongside the one led by the Social Democratic Party of Croatia. Controversies Petrina is known for his harsh statements against the Croatian right-center party Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and country's institutions and bureaucracy. He has denounced the first Croatian president Franjo Tuƒëman for impoverishing the Croatian people during the privatization, renaming a street in Primo≈°ten that bore his name. HDZ has criticized his actions as \\"barbaric\\". After winning eight seats in the ≈†ibenik-Knin County Assembly, he ignored legal provisions that banned him from serving both in municipal and county institutions, and had to be physically obstructed from attending the sessions by security guards. After managing to change the disputed law in 2013, he was again prevented from attending the sessions, calling the new government formed by the leftist party Social Democratic Party of Croatia the same as HDZ. Petrina is also known for his colorful language, insulting judges, bureaucrats and other politicians. His initiatives have brought him in the conflict with Croatian Radiotelevision, Hrvatska elektroprivreda, Croatian telecoms and the county water supply company - according to Petrina exposing the lack of rule of law and their abuse as instruments of political power against him. On February 13, 2014 he won the case at the European Court of Human Rights against the Republic of Croatia. Petrina claimed that he has been convicted in criminal proceedings without having had an opportunity to appear at the hearing. On December 19, 2007 Petrina was found guilty at the ≈†ibenik Municipal Court on the count of attempted grievous bodily harm, and sentenced to four months' imprisonment, suspended for one year. On 10 October 2008 Petrina's appeal was dismissed by the ≈†ibenik County State Attorney's Office, and on 29 April 2010 again at the Croatian Constitutional Court. European Court declared a violation of Article 6 ¬ß¬ß 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ordering the Croatian government to pay EUR 7,300 in damages. Public perception According to the results of a survey conducted by '≈†ibenik TM' among the citizens of the ≈†ibenik-Knin County in 2011, Petrina was declared the politician who embodies the highest number of desirable and positive qualities. The citizens of the county respected Petrina's courage, enthusiasm, honesty, patriotism, vision and credibility. He has been described as a person who dominated the political scene of ≈†ibenik and the county during the first decade of the third millennium. \\"It's not just the frequency of his appearance in the media, but primarily due to the impact that he had on molding the public opinion and political attitudes of citizens.\\".

Built in 1931, the ship was used for rum running for five years until Prohibition ended, and was turned into a coastal freighter. She was commissioned during World War II by the Royal Canadian Navy as an auxiliary minesweeper. Declared surplus in 1945, she was sold off in 1946. Reo II ended up in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia under the care of the Lunenburg Marine Museum Society. In 1984 Reo II was deemed unfit for repair, and was scuttled off Halifax in 1985.  Design  CG-100, a typical patrol boat used during prohibition Reo II was designed specifically with rum running in mind. The ship was built with a low silhouette and was painted grey in order to avoid detection from the US and Canadian Coast Guard. The ship was long, and could hold 129 tonnes of cargo.  Rum running  During Prohibition, Reo II was used for five years as a supply vessel for illegal liquor and spirits. Under direction of its captain, Aubrey Backman, the ship made countless trips along the North Atlantic Coast. The usual trip saw Reo II leave Nova Scotia for St. Pierre, where she would load up on goods. She then travelled down the United States to various drop off points, and returned to Nova Scotia. Reo II often visited other ports in Nova Scotia, such as Halifax and Lunenburg. After Prohibition ended, Reo II was used as a coastal freighter.  War  Reo II was chartered by the Royal Canadian Navy on 30 July 1940, but was not commissioned until 23 January 1941. Identified under the pennant number A33, she served the Navy mainly as an auxiliary minesweeper in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, but also as an examination vessel and coil skid towing vessel. She ended her Naval duties on 19 October 1945, when she was declared surplus and was then sold in 1946.  Post war  In 1970, Reo II was purchased by the Lunenburg Marine Museum Society, who placed her on display at the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She remained there until 1984, when marine architects determined that the boat was not fit for repair. Reo II was taken from her mooring at the museum on 24 February 1985, and was towed out to sea roughly northeast of Halifax where the ship was scuttled at an explosive dumping ground.

He joined a Boston art association, since there was no art school there, and met with its members in their studios to share critiques and encouragement. He also sent some of his works to New York's Art Union, where they were sold. Hall went to Europe with Eastman Johnson to study in 1849, funded by the sale of genre scenes and portraits. They studied at the D√ºsseldorf Academy, which had a good reputation for the genre painters it produced. They studied drawing, proportion and anatomy. Hall was there for more than one year. He then went to France and studied in Paris for a year, visited Switzerland, and was in Italy for a year, where he had a studio in Rome. Over the course of his life, Hall was based in the state of New York, but took international trips. For instance, in the 1870s he traveled to Palestine, Egypt and Spain. Hall had many friends from the Hudson River School. Career Hall opened a studio in New York City in 1852. Hall's paintings, inspired by the British Pre-Raphaelite movement, often depicted still lifes, scenes from the Mediterranean countries or everyday life. The Smithsonian deems him to be \\"one of the most well-respected still- life painters in America,\\" whose work was popular throughout his lifetime. Mid 19th century still life paintings became popular, and several artists created \\"opulent botanical arrangements in which the beauty and succulence of each flower or fruit replaced the earlier emphasis on compositional structure.\\" Hall, Paul Lacroix, Severin Roesen and John F.

Hall's works were shown in a solo exhibition at Goupil and Company in New York City in 1856. At that time it was rare for an artist to have a solo show, \\"Mr. G.H. Hall was given a public exhibition of his works at Messrs. Goupil & Co.'s store, which mode of exhibiting an artist's productions is entitled to some considerations. We think it has many advantages.

His still lifes were shown in 1860 at the academy and early in that decade at Seville, Spain. By 1868 he was making genre paintings and did not return to still lifes in great number until the 1880s. He lived in Paris, Rome and D√ºsseldorf for 23 years and traveled to Spain and Italy, and made popular paintings of peasants there. He made one for his friend William Cullen Bryant of a gypsy girl that was one of the most recognized paintings. By 1874 he had a studio in New York in the Tenth Street Studio Building, working from that studio for many years. The Catskill Mountains in New York was a favored place to live and work for many 19th century artists, particularly landscape artists.

The work was translated into English by Richard Hyrde around 1529 becoming then known by the title Instruction of a Christian Woman. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the work was popular in both the Catholic and Protestant communities. This treatise on female education is divided into three parts: Book I ‚ÄúWhich Treats of Unmarried Young Women‚Äù, Book II ‚ÄúWhich Treats of Married Women,‚Äù and Book III ‚ÄúOn Widows.‚Äù Praised by Erasmus and Thomas More, Vives advocated education for all women, regardless of social class and ability. From childhood through adolescence to marriage and widowhood, this manual offers practical advice as well as philosophical meditation and was recognized soon after publication in 1524 as the most authoritative pronouncement on the universal education of women. Arguing that women were intellectually equal if not superior to men, Vives stressed intellectual companionship in marriage over procreation, and moved beyond the private sphere to show how women's progress was essential for the good of society and state.

There would be no statutory limit on the amount of money the government is allowed to borrow between now and then. The current cap on borrowing is $17.2 trillion. It passed in the House and Senate during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act would suspend the public debt limit for the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending on March 15, 2015. The bill would increase the debt limit, effective March 16, 2015, to the extent that: :(1) the face amount of such obligations outstanding on the date of enactment of this Act is exceeded by :(2) the total of the face amount of public debt obligations and the face amount of obligations whose principal and interest are guaranteed by the U.S. government (except guaranteed obligations held by the Secretary of the Treasury) outstanding on March 16, 2015. The bill would exclude an obligation under clause 2 (above) from being taken into account unless its issuance was necessary to fund a commitment incurred pursuant to law that required payment before March 16, 2015. The bill would prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from issuing obligations during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending on March 15, 2015, for the purpose of increasing the cash balance above normal operating balances in anticipation of the expiration of such period. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as posted on the website of the Committee on Rules on February 10, 2014 (Committee Print 113-37). This is a public domain source. Upon enactment, S. 540 would suspend the current debt limit through March 15, 2015. On the following day, the debt ceiling would be raised by the amount of obligations incurred up to that point. The legislation also would extend across-the-board cuts (known as sequestration) in certain direct spending programs for an additional year beyond 2023‚Äîthe last year for which sequestration will apply under current law. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that those provisions would reduce direct spending by about $9.2 billion in fiscal year 2024. Section 5 would revise section 403 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (), as modified by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, which reduced the annual cost-of-living adjustment for annuities paid to certain military retirees and survivors by up to one percent. Section 5 would apply the changes from P.L. 113-67 only to those who first became members of the uniformed services after January 1, 2014, and would increase direct spending by about $6.8 billion over the 2014-2024 period, CBO estimates. Section 6 would create a fund to be used by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pay for physicians‚Äô services under Part B of Medicare. CBO estimates that provision would increase direct spending by about $2.4 billion, with that effect falling in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. On balance, enacting S. 540 would reduce direct spending by a total of $34 million over the 2014-2024 period, by CBO's estimation. The legislation would have additional effects after 2024 because the repeal of section 403 of P.L. 113-67 would continue to have costs in all subsequent years. The additional year of sequestration under section 6 would partially offset those costs by yielding several billion dollars of budgetary savings in fiscal year 2025. In combination, those effects would increase direct spending, CBO estimates, by more than $5 billion in at least one of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2024. Procedural history The Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act was originally introduced into the United States Senate on March 12, 2013 by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D, NH) under a different name and contents. The original text of the bill was about renaming an air route traffic control center after one of its long-time employees, but the bill became unnecessary when the House-sponsored version of the bill was signed into law. Nearly a year later, the United States House of Representatives used the bill as a vehicle to quickly pass a debt ceiling increase. The House changed the name to the Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act on February 11, 2014, and passed it in Roll Call Vote 61 by a vote of 221-201. The Senate passed the amended bill the next day in Senate Vote 34 with a vote of 55-43. Debate and discussion The bill had the support of both the House and the Senate Democratic leadership and President Barack Obama. Only 28 Republicans voted in favor of the bill in the House with 199 Republicans voting against the bill. The bill passed in the House primarily due to support from the Democrats. Conservative organization Heritage Action announced its opposition of the bill and called on Senators to vote against it. According to Heritage Action, while the limit is suspended, \\"President Obama and Congress will have a blank check to spend and borrow. This is extremely reckless given our nation‚Äôs $17.3 trillion debt. Every American household already owes more than $140,000 on the debt.\\" The National Taxpayers Union (NTU) also opposed the bill. The group criticised politicians from both parties saying, \\"this year, as the limit approached, most Democrats refused to discuss the debt problem at all. Republicans opted to stress important, though mostly unrelated policy goals, thus failing to focus on the key issue at hand.\\" NTU expressed the opinion that spending reforms should be dealt with, instead of just increasing the debt limit.

Gagiƒá was born in village of Ribnica in the Ribarska Banja region near Kru≈°evac. After several Turks abducted his sister Teodora, Janko, a young and courageous man, with several comrades chased them down and killed them. As it was unsafe for him to remain in his home region, he moved to the village of Boleƒç between Belgrade and Grocka. He joined the Serbian Free Corps and participated in the Austro-Turkish War and Koƒça's frontier rebellion, where he gained military experience. Known for his bravery, he was chosen to be a knez (village chieftain) in Boleƒç during the Habsburg occupation of Serbia. After the war and return of Ottoman rule, the Janissaries began to empower themselves. In 1801, the Janissary leaders, known as Dahije, took over the Sanjak of Smederevo in defiance of the Sultan. Janko had by become an influential brigand. Janko was unreluctant in attacking Dahije and controlled a road to Smederevo near Boleƒç along with his comrades. When the Dahije started to fear that the Sultan would make use of the Serbs to oust them, they decided to execute notable Serbs to forestall this. As a notable hajduk commander, Janko was subject of fear among Turks, which is why he was targeted; the Turks abducted his son, forcing Janko to surrender. He was decapitated. His death was described in the Serbian epic folk poem Otac (\\"The Father\\"). Today, one of the biggest streets, and a public fountain in Boleƒç, are named after him. In February 2014, exactly 210 years after his assassination, his remains were moved into a Boleƒç churchyard tomb.

It was also issued as the album's second single, after \\"Without You\\", and peaked at number 27 on America's Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 16 in Canada. Written by Nilsson, the song is in the hard rock style and marked a departure from his previous work. The recording was produced by Richard Perry and includes a segment where the bass player, Herbie Flowers, audibly detunes his instrument. \\"Jump into the Fire\\" gained further recognition following its inclusion as the soundtrack to a pivotal scene in Martin Scorsese's 1990 gangster thriller Goodfellas. It also featured prominently in the 2015 film A Bigger Splash, starring Ralph Fiennes and Tilda Swinton. Composition and recording \\"Jump into the Fire\\" is a rock song written and performed in a style that music journalist Matthew Greenwald likens to the early-1970s sound of the Rolling Stones. He adds: \\"Lyrically, on the surface, it's a hot lovers plea; however, it could easily be taken as a plea to society as a whole. Like a lot of Nilsson's greatest songs, it works on many different levels.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes the track as \\"surging hard rock\\", while James Parker of The Atlantic calls it \\"livid, dragon-bones funk\\". Nilsson recorded the song in London in 1971 for his album Nilsson Schmilsson.Patricia Romanowski & Holly George-Warren (eds), The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, Fireside/Rolling Stone Press (New York, NY, 1995; ), p. 713. As with much of the material on the album, it marked a departure from his previous work, as Nilsson was keen for commercial success after years of recognition as a quality artist and songwriter. He later commented: \\"What do you say to a man who writes 'The Puppy Song' and then writes 'Jump into the Fire'? I really needed [to make that change], too; that was exactly what I was hoping would happen.\\"Jim Irvin & Colin McLear (eds.), The Mojo Collection: The Ultimate Music Companion (4th edn), Canongate Books, Edinburgh, UK, 2007, , p. 267. The sessions were produced by Richard Perry, whom Nilsson acknowledged as having been instrumental in his progression. The musicians on the basic track were Nilsson (piano), Chris Spedding (guitar), Herbie Flowers (bass) and Jim Gordon (drums). Flowers recalls that Nilsson gave only vague instructions: \\"lots of tom-toms, a bass riff in D major.\\" The bass part includes a section where, following Gordon's drum solo, Flowers detunes as he plays. According to Flowers, he began loosening the bottom string \\"for a laugh\\", believing that by that point in the song, the performance would be faded out on the released recording. Overdubs on this master take included Nilsson's vocals, guitar solos by John Uribe and another rhythm guitar part, by Klaus Voormann. Release \\"Jump into the Fire\\" received substantial airplay throughout the early 1970s. After the international success of Nilsson's cover of the Badfinger ballad \\"Without You\\", the song was a surprising choice for the second single from Nilsson Schmilsson. It was edited down from around seven minutes to three-and-a-half for this release. The single peaked at number 27 on America's Billboard Hot 100 chart, number 16 on the RPM singles chart in Canada, number 26 on Australia's Go-Set National Top 40, and number 34 in West Germany. Later in 1972, Nilsson included \\"Jump into the Fire\\" in his musical horror film Count Downe.Caroline Joan S. Picart, Frank Smoot, Jayne Blodgett, The Frankenstein Film Sourcebook, Greenwood Press, Westport, CT, 2001, , p. 263. The film was produced by Ringo Starr and later retitled Son of Dracula for its limited cinema release in 1974.Alan Clayson, Ringo Starr, Sanctuary (London, 2003; ), pp. 237‚Äì38. In 1990, the song was used by director Martin Scorsese as the soundtrack to a frenetic scene in his film Goodfellas, when Ray Liotta's character, a cocaine-addicted gangster, fears that the authorities are closing in on his illegal activities. Rolling Stone described the effect: \\"This is what paranoia sounds like ... the more the filmmaker fades those 'Oh oh ooohs' in and out, the more your own nerves start to fray.\\" Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club writes: \\"I have to admit, even when I play 'Jump Into The Fire' today, I keep seeing that same helicopter.\\" Michael Gallucci of the website Ultimate Classic Rock lists \\"Jump into the Fire\\" at number 3 in his list of the ten best Nilsson songs, behind \\"Without You\\" and \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\". Cover versions In his review for AllMusic, Greenwald highlights LaVern Baker's cover of the track for the Everybody Sings Nilsson tribute album as a \\"hot version\\". The song was regularly performed as an encore by LCD Soundsystem. The band's dance adaptation of the track appears in their 2012 documentary Shut Up and Play the Hits. In 2015, \\"Jump into the Fire\\" was covered by Alice Cooper's supergroup Hollywood Vampires on their self-titled debut album. Cooper said: \\"Harry Nilsson was a ballad writer, so we found 'Jump into the Fire', which was actually a pretty good rock song. It was all based on drums, so we have Dave Grohl on drums.\\" A version by Robin Zander was included on his first solo album, titled Robin Zander.

Note that only characters from the main series are detailed here. For characters from related publications, check the navigation box at the bottom of this page. De Sousa's initial characters were all male. He was once called a \\"misogynist\\" for this, which led him to create his first female characters, inspired by some of his own daughters.  Main characters  The four main characters of Monica's Gang are: * Monica (M√¥nica) * Jimmy Five (Cebolinha \\"Little Onion\\") * Smudge (Casc√£o) * Maggy (Magali)  Minor characters  * Franklin (Franjinha) - The child prodigy of the gang. He is a scientist who creates formulas, time machines and several fantastic devices in his laboratory that often fall into the hands of their friends creating serious problems. Many times Jimmy Five takes advantage of using his inventions to use them to defeat Monica, sometimes convincing Franklin to help him in his plans to dominate the street. He owns of the puppy Blu, who has been his best friend since the first comic strips. Usually seen walking along with Bucky, Jeremiah, and Manezinho, which has been his friends since the earliest comics. He also has a secret love for Marina, often using their inventions to try to impress her. He is blond with a black bangs covering his forehead, usually wears black shorts, brown shoes, and a red shirt with a button (very similar to Jimmy Five's clothes), and occasionally also a white coat when in his laboratory. The character was originally based on Mauricio de Sousa himself as a child. * Angel (Anjinho) ‚Äì As the name suggests, he is the guardian angel of Monica's Gang. He lives in the clouds high up above (presumably heaven). Acting more like a superhero, he is constantly called to help children under his guard, including Monica and all her friends. He also works like an advice-giver to the gang. It is impossible for him to protect all the kids from the scrapes they get into, and he most likely becomes involved in the chaos. His recurring gag is the many different ways that the gang will use to call him down (most usually Monica), often getting Angel injured or scared. * Sunny (Xaveco) ‚Äì Jimmy Five and Smudge's best friend. The main characteristic of this boy a lack of any defining features. He is always referred to as \\"the secondary character\\", and the main characters always make fun of his apparent uselessness. He constantly attempts to elevate his rank to that of a main character, a trait which he transfers to his teen version in the spinoff series Monica Teen. Sunny originally appeared in the 1960s comic strips as one of several Jimmy Five's friends with whom he starred, and continued to appear in the comic books usually serving as a supporting character in most of the stories without showing any personality. After the years 2000s he began to have more prominence in the stories (when the \\"secondary character\\" jokes started), having an older sister and divorced parents.Mauricio's interview with RIO M√çDIA * Denise - A gossipy friend of Monica and Maggy, but sometimes acting as a rival to them when being with Cindy. Like Sunny, before she was a minor character but with an inconsistent design that often changes every story, until be revealed in a story that the character was played by several girls. Currently, she has appeared in stories with a fixed look having brown hair with pigtails and a purple dress. Originally in the first appearances during the 1990s she had no personality, and is often used as a support character for Monica and Maggy in stories focused only in the girls, or sometimes serving as an accomplice to Cindy practicing bullying against Monica. In recent stories after having her official look she has appeared more frequently in stories often being characterized by her outgoing, outspoken and self-centered, but charismatic, personality, sometimes acting more mature than the other kid characters. * Bucky (Titi) ‚Äì Franklin's best friend and one of the older boys in the gang. He is an arrogant, narcissistic and flirtatious boy. Bucky has teeth as big as Monica, but his friends hardly make fun of that. Bucky dates Annie, but constantly betrays her hidden and hangs around with any girls he sees. He sometimes ends up alone and hated by his ex-girlfriends, because he dates so many girls that it becomes impossible for him to hide one from the others. Usually he is seen together Franklin, Jeremiah and Manezinho in most of the stories, sometimes forming the team of the older boys known as the \\"Turma do Bermud√£o\\" (lit. Big Shorts' Gang). * Jeremiah (Jeremias) ‚Äì One of Bucky's best friends, and one of Mauricio's few Afro-Brazilian characters. At first, he was drawn in a strong black color, but nowadays, his color is a softer brown. * Annie (Aninha) ‚Äì Bucky's (main) girlfriend.

Later, on the series sequel, Monica Teen, Annie finally gets over Bucky, leaving him desperate to reconsiliate the relationship. * Junior (Dudu) - The younger cousin of Maggy. A spoiled, troublemaker and a selfish 4-year- old boy who loves to tease the boys of the neighborhood, mainly Jimmy Five. He tends to be the opposite of Maggy, while his cousin is a glutton and has a voracious appetite Junior hates eating all kinds of food. He proves to be very intelligent for his age. * Marina ‚Äì First introduced in 1994, she was based on one of Mauricio's daughters, Marina Takeda e Sousa.Mauricio writes... Rounding Out Marina (Part Three) Both Marinas love painting and drawing. Sometimes she has a giant magic pencil capable of giving life to any drawing she does, as well as redesign objects and sometimes characters, also possessing an eraser capable of erasing anything. Marina caught Franklin's eye, and became the subject of his unrequited affection (although she does date him in the spinoff series Monica Teen). * Nick Nope (Do Contra) ‚Äì As his Portuguese name implies (\\"do contra\\" can be translated as \\"against\\", \\"contrary\\"), he likes to avoid the mainstream and do everything in reverse to the normal way.

In Monica Teen he along with Crystal first appeared working for Bubbly in his spaceship, occupying the rank of Ensign. * Hummer (Humberto) ‚Äì Hummer suffers from muteness, which means all he can do to communicate is to murmur \\"hmm-hmm\\".

Early years Auguste-Henri-Victor Grandjean de Montigny was born on 15 July 1776 in the parish of St-Merry in Paris. He studied architecture with Charles Percier and Pierre-Fran√ßois-L√©onard Fontaine, and became a neo-classicist. He won the Prix de Rome in 1799. In 1802 he went to Rome with the new director of the French school, and was responsible for the work needed to prepare the Villa Medici for students. In 1810 he was appointed architect to J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, King of Westphalia. He rebuilt the state rooms of the Bellevue Palace in Kassel, a triumphal gate, public fountains and the theatre. He was named first architect of the king in 1812. He returned to France in 1814 when Napoleon was deposed. Brazil Grandjean de Montigny refused an offer from Russia in favor of one to go to Brazil. He moved to Brazil in 1816 at the invitation of King John VI of Portugal (1816‚Äì26), who wanted to improve the cultural level of the colony. He arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 12 March 1816. He represented architecture among the French artistic colony organized and led by Joachim Lebreton, who created the Academy of Fine Arts in Rio. These artists had been educated at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and had been forced into exile after the fall of Napoleon. Other members of the group included the two brothers Nicolas-Antoine Taunay, painter of battle scenes, and Auguste Taunay, sculptor; Jean-Baptiste Debret, painter, and Charles-Simon Pradier, engraver. thumb Grandjean de Montigny was to live in Rio de Janeiro until his death in 1850. Throughout this period he was the only teacher of Architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts. He designed the Roman Arch (1816) and many other buildings in an eclectic classical style. He designed the building for the Academy of Fine Arts in 1817. Montigny built the Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio (exchange), completed in 1820 and later occupied by the customs. This is now the Casa Fran√ßa-Brasil, a cultural center. Grandjean de Montigny made innovative proposals for redeveloping Rio de Janeiro in 1824-25 and in 1827. He designed official and private buildings, including residences in Rio de Janeiro in the Passeio, Mariz e Barros, Haddock Lobo and Catumbi streets. Other buildings included the Royal College of Science, Arts and Crafts and the Candelaria market. He converted the Semin√°rio S√£o Joaquim for use as the Col√©gio Pedro II. In 1829 he was responsible for all the decorations for the festival celebrating the marriage of the Emperor Pedro I of Brazil and the Empress Am√©lie of Leuchtenberg. In 1848 he was charged with design of the Imperial Palace and the Senate. Auguste-Henri-Victor Grandjean de Montigny died in Rio de Janeiro in the spring of 1850.

The Centre was designed with an eye toward maintaining the existing buildings and their identity within the community. After several years of funding and development, the Centre was officially opened by Prince Charles in 1988. By the end of the 1980s, the Centre was home to Northern Stage and New Writing North, among other photography, audio, and visual arts productions. The Centre also promoted a successful Edinburgh Fringe stopover programme and an annual professional craft fair.

Launched in 1784, she spent the first years of her service on blockade duty in the English Channel where she single-handedly captured the French frigate, La Reunion. In 1795, Crescent was part of a squadron commanded by George Elphinstone, that forced the surrender of a Batavian Navy squadron at the capitulation of Saldanha Bay. After serving in the West Indies, Crescent returned to home waters and was wrecked off the coast of Jutland on 6 December 1808. Background Britain's early preference for smaller warships was mainly because of a requirement to maintain a large navy and to keep the expense of doing so down. However, by the latter half of the 1770s, Britain was facing a war with France, Spain and the United States of America, and was in need of a more powerful type of frigate.Winfield (p.137) In 1778, the Navy Board ordered the first of two new types of frigate, one with 38 guns, the Minerva-class, and the other with 36, the Flora-Class.Winfield (pp.136 & 137) Both had a main battery of 18-pounder guns. Crescent was ordered on 11 August 1781 and was to be of the 36-gun variety. Construction Built by John Nowlan and Thomas Calhoun of Bursledon, Crescent was along her gundeck, had a beam and a depth in the hold of . This gave her a capacity of 887 tons (bm). Launched on 28 October 1784, she was completed in January the following year, including copper sheathing of the hull, and was taken to Portsmouth where she was laid up in ordinary and not fitted for sea until 6 June 1790. Crescent was armed with a 26-gun main battery of 18-pounders on her gundeck, eight 9-pound guns and four 18-pound carronades on her quarterdeck, and two 9-pound guns and four 18-pound carronades on her fo'c'sle.Winfield (p.136) Career Initially commissioned under Captain William Young in May 1790, she was recommissioned in January 1793 under James Saumarez. She joined Rear-Admiral John MacBride's squadron on blockade duty in the English Channel and on 22 June, assisted by HMS Hind and a privateer named Lively, captured the 10-gun French privateer, le Chib de Cherbourg.

John Christian Schetky On the morning of 20 October 1793, lookouts on board Crescent reported sails off Cape Barfleur, on the Cotentin Peninsula, heading towards Cherbourg. Saumarez set a course to intercept, and with the wind in his favour, soon came up on the port side of the two vessels which proved to be the 38-gun French frigate La R√©union and a 14-gun cutter named Esp√©rance, returning from a raiding cruise in the Channel under the command of Captain Fran√ßois A. D√©nian.James (p.104)Clowes (p.479) A second British frigate, the 28-gun HMS Circe, was becalmed some away and Esp√©rance fled towards Cherbourg, leaving R√©union and Crescent to engage alone. Although the French ship was bigger, compared to , and carried a larger crew; the British ship had a slight advantage in weight of shot, to and was marginally faster.Clowes (p.479) After the opening exchanges, R√©union lost her fore yard and mizzen topmast while Crescent lost the top off her foremast. Both ships had rigging cut and a number of sails damaged but Crescent was still able to manoeuvre across R√©union's stern and rake her. This raking caused huge damage to the French ship and her crew, and although R√©union continued to resist for some time, she was no longer able to move effectively. With Saumarez about to cross his bow and Circe now rapidly approaching due to a strengthening wind, D√©nian realised he had no choice but to surrender his vessel.James (p.105) The engagement had lasted two hours and ten minutes during which time the cutter, Esp√©rance, managed to escape to Cherbourg. The French frigate S√©millante, which had been anchored in the harbour, was unable to come to R√©union's rescue because of contrary wind and tides. Capitulation of Saldanha Bay In 1795, Crescent was commanded by Edward Buller and on 7 March 1796 she made for the Cape of Good Hope. As part of a squadron commanded by George Elphinstone, she was present at Saldanha Bay where a squadron of the new Batavian Republic capitulated.Rodger (p.436) The Cape had long been important to Britain's marine traffic, providing a convenient stopping point en route to India. In the previous year, fearing that it may fall into the hands of the French, Britain had captured the colony from the Dutch. The following year (1796) the Dutch sent a squadron under the command of Rear-Admiral Engelbertus Lucas to recapture the Cape. Keith's ships trapped the Dutch in Saldanha Bay on 17 August and Lucas was forced to surrender without a fight. Crescent remained stationed at the Cape and in 1797 she was under the command of Captain John Murray. Murray was superseded by Captain John Spranger in February 1798, then Charles Brisbane in June that same year. West Indies Crescent was repaired and refitted at Deptford in August 1798, re-commissioned under William Lobb in April 1799 and sent to the West Indies. In November, while en route, she captured the 16-gun El Galgo. Then while serving on the Jamaica station, in July 1800 Crescent took the 12-gun Diligente, which the Royal Navy took into service as a 14-gun transport under her existing name. Between 21 May and 8 August, Crescent, , and Nimrod captured two Spanish vessels: a Spanish felucca that was sailing from Havana to Vera Cruz, and a xebec sailing from Campeachy to Havana. Captain Lennox Thompson took command of Crescent in July 1802 and in June the following year, Crescent was recommissioned under Lord William Stuart. Return to home waters Crescent returned to home waters in February 1806, under Captain James Carthew. She served in the North Sea before undergoing repairs between June and October 1808. Recommisioned under George Reynolds in April 1808 she remained in home waters and passed to Captain John Temple who was in command when Crescent was wrecked off the coast of Jutland on 6 December. More than 200 people died as a result, including Temple himself.

Marcel Violet, who had previously created the Sima- Violet cyclecar, founded a new company registered as the Soci√©t√© Sylla at Courbevoie on the northern side of Paris, and immediately announced his introduction of the Galba in the Spring of 1929. It was one in a succession of cars designed by Violet, a respected automobile engineer with a particular specialism in two-stroke engines. The only model was a small \\"voiturette\\" automobile that sat on a wheelbase and was powered by a 2-stroke twin cylinder engine of 564cc. The power unit was fitted at the front of the car and drove the rear wheels via a two speed transmission and a shaft-drive. Despite a long gestation period, the Galba proved short-lived. By October 1930 Marcel Violet was already producing the Huascar, a voiturette very similar to the Galba which was indeed produced at the same Courbevoie factory, but which had a slightly larger engine and was produced by a new company called \\"Voiturettes Huascar\\".

(November 16, 1867 ‚Äì 17 December 1943), was a Maltese Benedictine monk who served as the Bishop of Malta and the Titular Archbishop of Rhodes. Early life He was born Luigi Carlo Giovanni Giuseppe Publio Caruana in Floriana, in what was then the Crown Colony of Malta, part of the British Empire. He was the youngest of the three sons of Enrico Caruana, assistant secretary to the Admiral Superintendent of the Malta Dockyards, and Elizabetta Bonavia. His older brothers went on to become a London banker and the Judge-Advocate General of the British Raj in India. Caruana's mother died on January 25, 1869, when Luigi was still in his infancy, and he was raised by his father. In 1876, at the age of nine, he was admitted to the minor seminary of the Diocese of Gozo, and a year later he pursued his studies at St. Ignatius College in St. Julian's, administered by the Jesuit Fathers. Wishing to become a Benedictine monk, in 1882 he was enrolled in the school operated by the monks of Fort Augustus Abbey in Scotland, where he continued his studies. Monk In 1884, Caruana was received as a postulant of the monastic community, and received the monastic habit on March 21 of that year, celebrated by Benedictines as the feast day of St. Benedict, the founder of the Benedictine Order, and being given at that occasion the religious name of Maurus, after one of the founder's most noted disciples. He made his temporary profession of religious vows the following year, and he made his solemn vows three years later, on November 11, 1888. He then pursued his study of theology and was ordained a priest on March 14, 1891, by Hugh MacDonald, C.Ss.R., the Bishop of Aberdeen. He was then sent to pursue his ecclesiastical studies in Rome at San Anselmo College, an international center of studies run by the Benedictine Order. After his return to his abbey, Caruana taught philosophy, theology and Latin literature at the abbey school. In 1899 he was appointed a parish priest at Dornie, western Ross-shire, in the Scottish Highlands, for which he learned Gaelic to care for a widely scattered flock. In 1904, due to his talents and training, he was chosen to act as private secretary to the Maltese bishop, Ambrose Agius, O.S.B. (1856-1911), another Benedictine monk, who, at the time, was Apostolic Delegate to the Philippines. This was to be his only experience of higher ecclesiastical office before he was appointed bishop. In 1906, Caruana returned to Fort Augustus Abbey, where he was appointed choir master for the community. He also engaged in a preaching ministry in various locales in Scotland and England over the next few years, including Westminster Cathedral in London, where he preached a course of Lenten sermons. He was especially welcome by the Italian immigrant community of the United Kingdom for his proficiency in their language. Bishop In December 1914, Caruana was sent to Brazil on a preaching mission. He decided to spend time with his family back in Malta on the way. While there, he was summoned to Rome the following month where he learned that Pope Benedict XV had named him the Bishop of Malta. He was consecrated at the Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere by the Secretary of State of the Holy See, Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val on February 10 of the same year.Catholic Hierarchy Retrieved on 14 February 2014. The day was of significance, as it is celebrated in Malta as the Feast of St. Paul‚Äôs shipwreck there and by Benedictines as the Feast of St. Scholastica, the sister of St. Benedict. He was also honored with being appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The population of Malta received its new bishop with huge enthusiasm, as he was the first native son of the nation to head the Catholic Church there in centuries. He received a large donation from the public to commemorate the occasion, which he promptly turned to purchasing bread for the poor and for the upkeep of the seminary of the diocese. He became the first Maltese to be created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1918, shortly after the Order had been established by King George V. On March 29, 1928, Monsignor Caruana was granted the personal title of archbishop by Pope Pius XI, as the Titular See of Rhodes, which the Bishops of Malta had held concurrently since 1797, had been restored as a functioning diocese. According to ‚ÄúPope Grants Plenary Indulgence in Air Raids,‚Äù Advocate (Australia), January 7, 1943, a newspaper article accessible on the National Library of Australia Archives website. Archbishop Caruana, broadcasting to the Maltese on December 26, 1942 exhorted them to make an all-out effort for victory against the Axis powers. He is quoted as having said. ‚ÄúThere is no other alternative for all right-thinking men faced with the evidence of the inherent barbarity of the enemy, his anti- Christian temper, his persecution of religion, his contempt for the laws of civilization and his savage extermination of the Jews.‚Äù Caruana died during World War II, after he had led the island through the Siege of Malta by the Nazi Luftwaffe. He is buried in St Gregory The Great Parish Church, Sliema, Malta.

Although it serves a similar role to the MUTCD from the US Federal Highway Administration, it has been independently developed and has a number of key differences with its American counterpart, most notably the inclusion of bilingual (English/French) signage for jurisdictions such as New Brunswick with significant anglophone and francophone population, and a heavier reliance on symbols rather than text legends. Language Signs for the most part employ two languages, English, French or both. However, some signs are trilingual, incorporating English, French and an indigenous language such as Cree. Stop sign In Quebec, modern signs read either or , however it is not uncommon to see older signs containing both words in smaller lettering, with on top. Both and are considered valid French words and the (OQLF) notes that the use of \\"stop\\" on stop signs is attested in French since 1927.. No direct link: look up under and then click on either or under the resulting listing In practice, however, it can be empirically observed (for instance, with Google Street View) that predominates in French-speaking areas (i.e., most of the geographic extent of Quebec), while can be found in majority English-speaking areas such as Montreal's West Island suburbs. At the time of the debates surrounding the adoption of the Charter of the French Language (\\"Bill 101\\") in 1977, the usage of on the older dual-word signs was considered to be English and therefore controversial; some signs were occasionally vandalized with red spray paint to turn the word into \\"101\\".Photo by Flickr.com user \\"imagesdistributioncanada\\" However, it was later officially determined by the OQLF that is a valid French word in this context, and the older dual + usage is therefore not considered bilingual but merely redundant and therefore deprecated (). All newly installed signs thus use either one word or the other, but not both. The province of New Brunswick has bilingual in English-speaking areas. Acadian regions of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island also have bilingual signs. Some areas in Manitoba and Ontario also have bilingual signs. Entry points to the country through Canada Customs also have bilingual stop signs. On First Nations or Inuit territories, stop signs sometimes use the local aboriginal language in addition to or instead of English and/or French. Other parts of Canada use .

Note that the imperial speed limit (left) is shown using a Canadian-style sign, rather than an MUTCD-standard one as would be used in the US  Ontario road signs  The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) also has historically used its own MUTCD which bore many similarities to the TAC MUTCDC. However, as of approximately 2000, MTO has been developing the Ontario Traffic Manual (OTM), a series of smaller volumes each covering different aspects of traffic control (e.g., regulatory signs, warning signs, sign design principles, traffic signals, etc.).  Sign classification  The Ontario Traffic Manual Committee categorises all road signs into two main categories: freeway and non-freeway sign types. Signs are then subcategorised into two additional groups: urban and rural.  Examples of Ontario regulatory road signs  File:Ontario Rb-1A.svgalt=Ontario Rb-1A maximum speed sign.Some Ontario maximum speed signs have an additional tab at the bottom of the speed limit, reminding motorists that the unit of speed is kilometres per hour. The \\"km/h\\" tab sign (Rb-7t) is mandatory on all King's Highways because of the likelihood of unfamiliar interprovincial and international travellers. File:Ontario Rb-3.svgalt=Ontario Rb-3 maximum speed sign with both \\"km/h\\" and \\"BEGINS\\" tabs.Where there is a change in the legal speed limit, the first maximum speed sign in the new zone must be accompanied by a \\"BEGINS\\" tab sign (Rb-84t). File:Ontario Rb-97.svgalt=\\"Vehicles Over 5 Tonnes Must Have Valid Transponder\\" sign, located before entrance ramps to hwy. 407, also known as the ETR.The purpose of the VEHICLES OVER 5 TONNES MUST HAVE VALID TRANSPONDER sign is to indicate to heavy vehicles that they are required to have valid toll devices known as transponders when travelling on toll roads. Specifically, the sign above is located before entrance ramps to the 407 ETR (Express Toll Route). File:Ontario road sign Rc-13 + Rc-13t.svgalt=FASTEN SEAT BELT sign (Rc-13)The purpose of the FASTEN SEAT BELT sign is to remind passengers in vehicles to ensure that their seat belts are fastened while the vehicle is travelling.

The headland is located in the administrative area of the council of Rabat. Ras ir-Raƒßeb lies in the north western corner of the Rabat-Dingli-Mdina plateau, just off Fomm ir-Riƒß Bay. It rises to 45 metres above sea level. The peak allows views of the west coast of the island, as far as the cliffs of Ta' ƒäenƒã in Gozo. A wide variety of vegetation grows on the headland, including large populations of esparto grass on the clay slopes in the area. The headland also serves as a navigational marker. The headland incorporates the ruins of a megalithic temple, as well as Punic-Roman remains. Scholars have been arguing about the function of these remains for decades. Interpretations differ from a domestic villa to a small religious shrine, as well as a major temple dedicated to Heracles. The headland is also a popular diving site, which also includes a cave. The Ras ir-Raƒßeb coastline forms part of the Rdum Majjiesa to Ras ir- Raƒßeb marine protected area, the first marine area to be protected in Malta, in 2005. Toponymy and geography The two Maltese toponyms, Hermit's Headland () and Churches' Headland () may indicate that the site had an established religious significance in the late Middle Ages. The coast between Rdum Majjiesa and Ras ir-Raƒßeb was earmarked and proposed for protection, in a number of local environmental heritage management documents, including The Structure Plan for the Maltese Islands and the UNEP/MAP Coastal Area Management Programme (CAMP) Report for Malta. Due to their relative inaccessibility and the shelter they provide, the cliffs and the coastline at Ras ir-Raƒßeb provides refuge for several species of Maltese flora and fauna. The inaccessibility increases the ornithological importance of the coastal cliff habitat, given urban development decreased those habitats formerly used for breeding, feeding and wintering purposes, activities now mainly restricted to cliffs on the western coasts of Malta and Gozo. The area also hosts representatives of the main marine habitat types occurring in the Maltese islands with many species and ecosystems of conservation importance. These include meadows of Posidonia seagrass, which support a large variety of organisms for conservation interest such as the noble pen clam. The extensive sandbanks found in inlets along this coast and beyond the seagrass meadows support diverse aquatic animals that live on the seabed. This site is a Natura 2000 protected area. Ras ir-Raƒßeb's status as a marine protected area and its geological structure, with caves and posidonia meadows, have made it a unique and popular diving site. An underwater trail for divers, marked with signs, is also present. Archaeological excavations Megaliths at Ras ir-Raƒßeb The archaeological importance of Ras ir-Raƒßeb was known since the late sixteenth century, with attempts to identify these remains with the Fanum Iunonis temple mentioned by Cicero.Cic. Verr. iv. 46, 47 Other Renaissance historians did not agree with this view, describing only the existence of \\"ruins and ancient factories.\\" In 1922, the remains were brought to the notice of the Maltese archaeologist Themistocles ≈ªammit by the owner of the land. A large, square area paved with \\"very regularly laid\\" small, baked tiles, was discovered by the farmer who tilled the field. The archaeologist unearthed \\"a frame of stonework\\" as well as the remains of a door-sill. The amount of household pottery, betrayed ‚Äúa numerous settlement.‚Äù ≈ªammit went on to state that \\"the site should be kept in mind as one that could be studied and excavated with profit.\\" The site was partly excavated by a team of Royal Navy officers under Capt. D. Scott and Sgn. Comdr. P. Pugh. However, the exposed masonry as well as contemporary deposits had been almost completely eroded, making the interpretation of the archaeological remains very difficult. Work began in November 1961 and finished in May 1962, when a party of naval divers explored the seabed off the headland, reaching a depth of over 60 metres. A few scattered stone blocks lying in the sand were noted. The report of this excavation is brief, with the published plan of the site being inaccurate. The team was of the opinion that the place \\"was used as a sacred site from Neolithic times to about the 4th century AD.\\" The site itself suggests a building complex of importance, commanding extensive sea views. It was surrounded, on at least three sides, by an esplanade delimited by a semicircular wall which extended from east to west and can be followed for a length of about 62 metres. Today, only the foundation stones, cut in squared limestone blocks, survive but a plan of the cluster of rectangular rooms grouped round a central courtyard can still be made out. The pavement of small white marble cubes embedded in concrete, and a few diamond-shaped tiles survived in one of the rooms until 1977, but by 1988, these had disappeared. In the centre of the main room, there are two well dressed oblong stones, which were thought to form part of an altar. In the north-eastern corner, there is a long and narrow rectangular cistern. It has a circular opening dug into a block of limestone, with an opening for rainwater at one end. Although no water source feeds the cistern, the permanent spring of Gƒßajn Bierda, which flows a hundred yards to the south-east, may have been deviated to lower ground, providing the buildings with a year-round supply of fresh water. Site plan of the Megalithic and Punic-Roman remains at Ras ir-Raƒßeb A main point of interest of the remains at Ras ir-Raƒßeb is the integration of two rough stone megaliths within the Punic-Roman structure. These are the remains of an earlier, prehistoric structure. The only other instance in Malta of the reuse of the remains of a prehistoric building is at Tas-Silƒ° where the rear-apse of a megalithic temple was included in building of a Punic-Roman sanctuary. These two sites share a number of similarities, such as the position of the courtyard with respect to the rest of the building ‚Äì leading to the hypothesis that the Ras ir-Raƒßeb site may have also had a religious meaning. A reassessment of Ptolemy‚Äôs descriptions attempted to link this site with a temple to Heracles, The island of Melite on which is ... and the temple of Heracles. At Google Books. but the arguments are not conclusive. During the 1962 excavation, a coin of Constantius II was found, hinting at a long life of the building and its possible use in early Christian times. A ‚Äúgreat quantity of pottery‚Äù found in the cistern included the whole range of the Roman occupation. Four other coins found at the site were in an advanced stage of corrosion, with two of them being classified as Siculo-Punic. Limestone blocks at the site Of greater interest is an ivory plaque, with a low relief of a crouching boar that is not of Classical Greek influence and may indicate the survival of Punic culture. Two clay satyr masks on vessel legs were also found, and classified as Punic. The remains of a clay figurine of a nude male youth, broken from the waist upwards, however, is probably a late Hellenistic work. Several other pieces of clay figurines, including another male nude and a draped female holding a small pyxes, a small grotesque head of a bald and bearded old man, and a fragment of a cloaked figure were collected from among the debris. Fragments of incense stands were also found. In addition to this site, a small quarry of unknown age lies south of these remains. It is possible that it provided the stone for the building of the complex. Legal status and state of conservation Seaview from Ras ir-Raƒßeb The beauty and relative inaccessibility of Ras ir-Raƒßeb have made it a popular stop for ramblers. However, this has not been without controversy, as the legal ownership of the headland is unclear. A group of ramblers were evicted from the promontory by a local hunter in late 2004. The ramblers included a number of archaeologists who wrote to the Estate Management Department asking how such an important archaeological site was out of bounds to the public. The department stated that \\"the land in question is in course of expropriation [...] which was expropriated by Government Notice 498 dated July 29, 1975. As such, legally land in question is still owned since deed of transfer is not finalised.\\" However, a ministerial declaration in 2006, by Tonio Borƒ°, who was then Minister of Justice and Home Affairs, concluded that \\"areas that have been taken over by Government through a President's proclamation prior to 1994, even though not paid for by the Government, such as Ras ir-Raƒßeb, can be legally accessed by the public and not even the owner can prohibit access.\\" The Punic-Roman remains were officially scheduled in 1998. A large wildfire burnt a significant swathe of the coastline in 2007, with various NGOs calling the general public to be vigilant and report abuse, in an area plagued by vandalism and illegal construction. Some of the ancient limestone remains found on site were vandalised in 2016. Holes were drilled into the blocks, with steel rods and hooks inserted into the remains to allow rock climbing along the nearby cliffs. In 2016, five tumoli of land forming part of the Ras ir-Raƒßeb headland was placed for sale - including the ancient remains found on the site. Heritage experts declared that while ownership of the land in questions appeared to be unclear, the recent introduction of a public domain law in Malta ought to exclude the purchase or sale of sites like Ras ir-Raƒßeb. In July 2016, Friends of the Earth, a local environmental committee, filed an application requesting that Ras ir-Raƒßeb along with six other sites be designated officially as public domain.

New locations, both food cart and storefront, are being added throughout New York (including a storefront on 14th Street and Second Avenue) and around the world. The franchise is most recognized by its primary dish which is a platter of chicken or gyro meat with rice, though it also serves a chicken or gyro wrap sandwich. History The Halal Guys was founded in 1990 by Egyptian-descended Mohamed Abouelenein, along with compatriots Ahmed Elsaka and Abdelbaset Elsayed, as a hot dog cart located at the southeast corner of 53rd Street and Sixth Avenue. Abouelenein, however, believed that a hot dog was not a satisfying meal, and switched to the current menu of chicken, gyro meat, rice, and pita in 1992. As a result, New York City's Muslim cab drivers flocked to the cart for its ability to provide a quick, relatively inexpensive halal meal. As word of the mouth spread via these cab drivers, the operators created the signature dish, a platter of chicken and rice which was popularized within the Muslim community in the city. The cart has caused a decline in the popularity of hot dog vendors in New York City and has influenced many imitation carts. A cart called \\"New York's Best Halal Food\\" is also located on the southwest corner of 53rd Street and Sixth Avenue. It is unknown which cart was located at the intersection first. On October 28, 2006, a fight that started in line ended with 23-year- old Ziad Tayeh stabbing and killing 19-year-old Tyrone Gibbons. The fight began after one accused the other of cutting in line. Tayeh was later found not guilty, as the jury found that he acted in self-defense. The New York Times once reported that the owners had hired bouncers. The Halal Guys donated $30,000 to LaGuardia Community College in 2016 with the money intended to fund scholarships for students experiencing financial hardships. Food The Halal Guys serves \\"American halal\\" platters and sandwiches, prepared using ingredients such as chicken, gyro meat, falafel and rice. The taste has been described as entailing a complex melting pot of flavors originating from the Mediterranean and Middle East. The Halal Guys also serve a white sauce condiment which patrons cite as a favorite and has been described as \\"famous\\". A \\"distant cousin of tzatziki\\", the Halal Guys' white sauce has been the subject of multiple recreations based on ingredients on to-go packets, but to no avail. A similar condiment is found at all or most other halal carts in New York City, but the recipe likely often varies from cart to cart. The Halal Guys also prepares a red hot sauce. Franchising Interior of a franchise in Springfield, Virginia, in June 2018 After being approached numerous times, holding off franchising to await a company that would respect their origins and core values, the Halal Guys hired Fransmart, the franchise development company behind the success and explosive growth of Qdoba Mexican Grill and Five Guys, in June 2014. Within the first year of launching their franchise expansion campaign they closed deals for California; New Jersey; Connecticut; Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Houston and Austin, Texas; Chicago, Illinois, as well as international deals for Canada, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. In total this represents over 200 locations under development. Reception In 2005, Chicken and Rice was one of four finalists for the \\"Vendy Award\\" presented by a New York City street vendor advocacy group known as the Street Vendor Project. Chicken and Rice eventually lost out to Rolf Babiel from Hallo Berlin, a sausage cart on 54th and 5th. In addition, the popularity of the cart has been further aided by high-profile customers. Chef Christopher Lee, who was one of Food & Wine Magazine's best new chefs of 2006, mentioned in an interview with the magazine that he \\"can't stay away from it\\" and once was there on Christmas Eve waiting two and a half hours in the cold. The cart has since become a prominent cuisine throughout New York City and has been heard as far as Hawaii. It has caused an increase in competition among street meat carts in Midtown Manhattan. Lines commonly grow to over an hour's wait. There is also a student club at New York University dedicated to the food cart. The Halal Guys was awarded the 2014 Multicultural Award by the American Muslim Consumer Consortium for their promotion of diversity and multiculturalism, and their inclusivity to all minorities in America.

Bee-Hive Girls Bee-Hive Girls was the Scout- like program for girls run by the Young Ladies‚Äô Mutual Improvement Association (YLMIA) of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons). Initial in 1913, the Ensign Stake YLMIA and Box Elder YLMIA used some portions of Camp Fire Girls' and Girl Guides' programs respectively. The Church indicated to Dr. Luther H. Gulick, the Camp Fire Girls founder, that it would not be officially involved with them, for a number of reasons related to the need of the Stake and General Boards to administrate all activities. Despite this, Dr. Gulick still met with a Bee-Hive committee representative with welcoming attitude. via The Bee-Hive Girls was official founded in 1915. For its Silver Jubilee Year, a year's worth of activities were planned for 1940 under General Bee-Hive Committee led by chairman Ileen Ann Waspe. In May 1943, the Bee-Hive Girls was reported to have 20,000 members. For the organization's war time efforts starting in June 1943, Bee-Hive War Emergency (BHWE) Swarms were formed of all three levels in each ward under one of the Bee Keepers so as to efficiently hand these efforts. Special honor badges were issued for each 12 hours of war time work. Earning three such honor badges, or 36 hours of war service, earn the girl a BHWE pin. 900 BHWE pins were issued by May 1, 1943. Bee-Hive Girls were organized into Swarms for each level in a stake which were headed by a Bee Keepers. Busy Bee Girl Characters of the program included Commando Rosy-Bee-Ready. Girl Scouts of America Girl Scouts of America (GSA) was an early girl Scouting organization that operated starting in 1910. The Girl Scouts of America was established in Des Moines, Iowa by Clara A. Lisetor-Lane in 1910. In 1911, the GSA and the Girl Guides (Spokane, Washington) planned to merge with the Camp Fire Girls to form the Girl Pioneers of America, but relationships fractured and the merger failed. That year, Lisetor-Lane had published her group's manual based on the Girl Guides handbook. Juliette Gordon Low attempted in 1913 to merge the Girl Scouts of the USA with the GSA. With the groups' similarities, Low thought this would be easy, but Lisetor-Lane felt Low copycatted her organization and threatened a lawsuit. With Low's group's growth, Lisetor-Lane thought that Low used underhanded tactics to lure troops away. The GSA never grew beyond a few troops as Lisetor-Lane had limited social connections and no financial resources to grow the organization on a national level. The GSA eventually died out. Boy Scouts of the United States Boy Scouts of the United States (BSUS) was a boys Scouting organization that operated in 1910. It was formed by the National Highway Protective Association on May 5, 1910, by Colonel E.S. Cornell, association secretary, and Colonel Peter S. Bomus, with Bomus heading up the program. Troops were to be operational by mid-summer 1910 on a small scale. Edward L. Rowan in \\"To Do My Best\\" indicated that Colonel E.S. Cornell had formed the National Highway Patrol Association Scouts. BSUS soon merged with the Boy Scouts of America with Bomus becoming a member of the National Council and National Scout Commissioner. In addition to the Boy Scout program of Baden-Powell, the BSUS troops were to advocate for good roads, drilled in a military style and study the nation's topography. LifeSaving Guards-Boys The LifeSaving Guards-Boys, or the Life Saving Scouts of the World, was a Boy Scouting organization that operated starting in 1910. Salvation Army founder William Booth met with Baden-Powell for discussion about a possible Salvationist Scouting program. The Salvation Army thus began its Life Saving Scouts of the World in 1913 for boys and in 1915 a parallel organisation, Life-Saving Guards, for girls. After the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the BSA's rights to the \\"Scouting\\" service mark, several Scouting organizations were forced to change their names. In 1918, the Life Saving Scouts changed its name to LifeSaving Guards-Boys which led to many Life Saving units transferring to the BSA. LifeSaving Guards-Boys leader began to press for affiliation with the BSA. In 1929, a special charter was granted to the Life Saving Guards-Boys from the BSA to join the two organizations together.

He inherited a large number of estates and by the time of his death he was the largest landowner in Devon. He was a philanthropist and generous benefactor to charities and religious societies. He spent much of his life in Florida attempting to establish an \\"ideal society\\", a Utopian colony of poor, homeless or criminal English persons named Rollestown or Charlotta. On the failure of that venture he turned to slave labour. Following the loss of Florida as a British possession in 1783 he moved his colony to a smaller site on Exuma in the Bahama Islands. Life and family lion rampant of the first three bezants The Rolle family was one of the richest and most powerful in Devon and owned several dozen manors, their most ancient holding being Stevenstone near Great Torrington in the north of the county, whilst Bicton in the south-east was the centre of another large block of territory.  Early life  Denys Rolle was the youngest of four sons of John Rolle (1679‚Äì1730), of Bicton and Stevenstone, by his wife Isabella Charlotte Walter, daughter of Sir William Walter, 2nd Baronet of Sarsden, Oxfordshire. His eldest brother was Henry Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (died 1759) of Stevenstone, whose heir was his next younger brother John Rolle Walter (c. 1714 ‚Äì 1779), who was a Tory MP. Denys was baptised on 19 July 1725 in St Giles's Church, St Giles in the Wood, the parish church of Stevenstone. He matriculated at New College, Oxford on 19 January 1742, at the age of 16. He was named after his cousin Denys Rolle (1614‚Äì1638), of Stevenstone, who had inherited Bicton and other lands from his mother Ann Denys, a co-heiress of the ancient Devon family of Denys of Holcombe Burnell.  Marriage and children  On 22 May 1750 in East Down, Devon, Denys Rolle married Anne Chichester (1721‚Äì1781),Vivian, p.177, pedigree of Chichester of Hall, Anne was baptised 11 October 1721 at Bishops Tawton; Per her husband's monument in St Giles's Church, St Giles-in-the-Wood, Devon, she died 24 May 1781 \\"aged 64\\"(sic) a daughter (by his second wife) of Arthur Chichester (1670-1737/8) of Hall, Bishop's Tawton, Devon,Vivian, Heralds' Visitations of Devon, 1895, p.177, pedigree of Chichester of Hall a junior line of the ancient and prominent Chichester family of Raleigh.

National Archives C 211/22/R134 *Christiana Philippa Maria Rolle (1759‚Äì1831), died 3 February 1831, Aged 72. *Florence Rolle (born 1762)  Character  A modest man, considered eccentric, his favourite pastime was to perform the work of a common farm-labourer. He was puritanical in morals, opposing ale-houses, cockfighting and bear-baiting, and was humane and tender towards animals claiming a special kinship with wildlife. He has also been described by Theresa Ann White as stubborn, high-handed, irascible, litigious, and a megalomaniac, even stupid, and lacking diplomatic skills. Parliamentary career Rolle was elected MP for Barnstaple in 1761 but after 1764 most of his time was occupied by his colony in Florida rather than Barnstaple or national politics. He was re-elected in 1768. Although not attached to any party, Rolle voted with the Opposition when he was at Parliament but seems not to have spoken in the House. He lost his seat at the general election of 1774 being defeated by William Devaynes, a supporter of the government.  Property in England = Inheritances  Beam House, Great Torrington Hudscott, Chittlehampton As the fourth son Denys Rolle had been born with no expectation of inheriting the vast Rolle estates of his father. He had been provided for his residence with the Rolle manor of Beam near Great Torrington.National Archives C11/569/28. Court of Chancery, document dated 1747: \\"Denys Rolle Esquire late of Beam and now of Hudscott\\" However he received a three-fold inheritance which, together with his own land purchases around Otterton in South Devon, meant that on his death he was the largest land owner in the county of Devon, the second largest county in England, with a rent-roll of ¬£40,000 per annum. His eldest brother Henry Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (died 1759) had inherited his paternal estates in 1730 but died childless in 1759. His younger brother John Rolle Walter (c. 1714‚Äì1779) was his heir. In 1731, at the age of 17, John inherited the Oxfordshire lands of his childless uncle Sir Robert Walter, 4th Baronet (1680‚Äì1731), of Sarsden in Oxfordshire and had changed his name to Walter, as required by the bequest. The third brother, William Rolle (1720 ‚Äì c.1747) of Beam, died childless some time after 1747National Archives PROB 11/755/55, Will of William Rolle of Great Torrington, Devon, 6 June 1747. which left Denys Rolle as the heir to the Rolle and Walter lands. Denys also inherited the estate of Hudscott in the parish of Chittlehampton, Devon, from his distant childless cousin Samuel Rolle (1704‚Äì1747) son and heir of Samuel Rolle (1669‚Äì1735) of Hudscott, MP for Barnstaple. This inheritance included a moiety of the manor of Countisbury in North Devon. He also inherited the manors of East Tytherley in Somerset and Shapwick in Somerset, which had been acquired by his cousin Henry Rolle (1589‚Äì1656), Chief Justice of the King's Bench, descended from the most junior Rolle line. Thus at the age of about 21 Denys Rolle had inherited Hudscott, where he lived during most of his life and where several of his children were baptised. In 1779, at the age 54, following the death of his brother John Rolle Walter, he inherited the paternal Rolle estates of Stevenstone and Bicton. Otterton and East Budleigh In 1786 he purchased for the huge sum of ¬£72,000 the manors of Otterton and East Budleigh, situated adjacent to Bicton in south-east Devon from the heirs of the Duke family, descendants of Richard Duke (died 1572) who in 1540 had purchased the former lands of Otterton Priory following the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The properties acquired included:Devon Heritage Centre, 48/22/1/2, Conveyance, East Budleigh; Colaton Raleigh; Harpford; Otterton; Venn Ottery , 25 March 1786 > Capital messuage, barton farm and demesne lands of Otterton and the manors > and lordships of Otterton, Little Otterton, Budleigh Poleslow (otherwise > Higher Budleigh), Budleigh Syon (otherwise Lower Budleigh), Collaton > Rawleigh (otherwise the Lower Manor), Dukes-Collaton, (otherwise Collaton > Abbott otherwise The Higher Manor), Dotton (otherwise Docton) and Hays > (otherwise Powershays otherwise Dukes Hayes); 4 water grist mills in > Otterton and the advowsons of the churches of Otterton, Budleigh and > Harpford with the free chapels of Withecombe, Fen Ottery, Rectory and Sheaf > of Otterton and a fee farm rent of ¬£13. 10s., payable out of the sheaf of > Sidmouth, etc. Land sales Rolle sold his Somerset estate of Shapwick in 1786/7 to George Templer (1755‚Äì1819), of the East India Company, 4th son of James I Templer (1722‚Äì1782) of Stover, Teigngrace.  North American plantations =Florida In May 1764 Rolle obtained a grant from the crown of 20,000 acres of land for a plantation in St Mark's in East Florida, an area recently ceded by Spain to Great Britain following the Seven Years' War. One of the numerous conditions was that he should settle it with white Protestants.Stork and Roll (1766), p23, Terms of grant. His vision was to establish an \\"ideal society\\", a Utopian colony for poor, homeless or criminal English persons. He embarked for America on 10 June 1764 with 14 settlers and arrived at Charleston on 12 August 1764 and was in St Augustine, capital of East Florida, by September 1764. He soon discovered that this land was unsuitable and instead, with the permission of the Governor of East Florida James Grant (1720‚Äì1806), settled on the east bank of the St Johns River, above today's East Palatka, which site he named Charlotta in honour of the Queen, later Charlotia, later Rollestown, thought to be on the site of today's San Mateo. Having quarrelled with Governor Grant and been refused further grants of land, he returned to England in October 1765. There he addressed his long and detailed \\"Humble Petition\\" to the Board of Trade complaining of his treatment. He returned to Florida however in September 1766 with a further 50 settlers.Stork and Roll (1766), p39. He returned to England again in January 1768, and again complained to the Board of Trade. Rolle's settlers were in the opinion of observers deemed low quality, of poor morality, indisciplined and not capable of hard work. Soon due to Rolle's harsh management style and their own unsuitability his colonists rebelled and deserted to Georgia or South Carolina, whereupon Rolle gave up his Utopian ideals and employed African slave labour. The plantation produced among other crops rice, corn and turpentine tar from pine trees for naval use. He acquired a further 20,000 acres from William Elliot and 20,000 from John Grayhurst, 10,000 from William Penrice and 3,000 from James Cusack, all on the eastern side of the St Johns River. He acquired a further 1,500 acres on the west side from Joseph Gray. Rollestown was visited in December 1765 by the naturalists John Bartram and his son William Bartram, and again in 1778, the latter who recorded his observations in a journal which survives. Rolle's activities were also recorded in the diary, correspondence and official reports of the Governor of Florida James Grant, who became increasingly infuriated by Rolle's constant demands, complaints and disputes Bahamas Following the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 Florida was ceded by the British government to Spain, and Rolle was thus forced to abandon his colony. He suffered great financial loss and claimed substantial compensation from the British government, which offered him instead a colony on the British island of Exuma in the Bahama Islands, about 500 miles to the south-east, to which he removed whatever livestock, equipment and slaves he was able to transport. When his son and heir Lord John Rolle's slaves (about 400 at this time) were officially declared free on 1 August 1838 many of them adopted the surname of Rolle. The slaves then took over the Rolle lands on Exuma and ran them communally although there was no formal deed of conveyance to them. Today there are still five Lord John Rolle Commonage Estates on Exuma including the village of Rolle Town. These have been passed down to the descendants of the former slaves and cannot be sold. Although the name Rolle died out in England on the death of Lord Rolle in 1842 (revived for a while in the person of his heir Mark Rolle (d.1907)), the surname Rolle is still in the 21st century a common name in the Bahamas, for example the actress Esther Rolle, born in Pompano Beach, Florida, of Bahamian parents; Myron Rolle, the Bahamian National Football League player, team member of the Tennessee Titans and Rhodes Scholar; and Magnum Rolle, a professional basketball player born in Freeport, Bahamas, in 1986. Philanthropy He was a philanthropist and generous benefactor to charities and religious societies. Rolle established several charity schools on different parishes and allocated to each a plot of land for the employment of the children. In 1790 he rebuilt part of St Giles's Church, the parish church of Stevenstone, which is commemorated by a stone heraldic escutcheon above the north transept door inscribed \\"DR 1790\\".St Giles's Church, Information Leaflet, p.3 Death Rolle died on 26 June 1797, aged 72, of angina during one of his habitual long walks between his manors of Hudscott and Stevenstone, and was buried in St Giles's Church on 1 July 1797 The vicar and historian of Chittlehampton, Rev. J.H.B. Andrews, wrote: In St Giles Church, St Giles in the Wood, there is a mural monument to Rolle, erected by Anne, his second daughter.

Description and history The Searles Hill Cemetery is located in rural southern Phillipston, on on the east side of Searles Hill Road north of its junction with Old Queen Lake Road; the latter is historically part of a major east-west route through the area. The cemeter is roughly rectangular in shape, with of road frontage lined by a stone wall of cut granite about high. The wall is set off from the road by a row of mature maple trees, and has a single entry gate flanked by granite posts. Fieldstone walls line the other three sides of the property. There is no formal circulation pattern within the cemetery grounds, with most markers arrayed generally in lines, grouped by family. There is one family plot, that of the Stratton family, that is set off by a steel rail fence with granite posts. Most of the cemetery's 98 markers are made of slate or marble; the oldest dated marker is from 1777. Phillipston was originally part of Templeton, which was settled about 1750 and incorporated in 1762. Phillipston was separated from Templeton in 1786 as the town of Gerry, and was renamed Phillipston in 1814. The land for this cemetery was donated to the community in 1759 by Charles Baker, one of the first settlers in the area.

His work focused on Southern Ontario and the area surrounding Mount Assiniboine. Panabaker was born in Hespeler, Ontario, the son of the local woollen mill manager and one- time mayor of the town, now part of Cambridge. He studied art in many locations, beginning in Hespeler under Farquhar McGillivray Knowles (1859‚Äì1932) and his wife, Elizabeth McGillivray Knowles. who gave him lessons, and his father was so encouraged that he was able to attend the Ontario College of Art under Arthur Lismer and J.E.H. MacDonald. He continued his artistic studies at the Grand Central School of Art in New York City and became a member of the Salmagundi Club, also in New York. A self-supporting professional artist for his entire adult life, he began his painting career during the Great Depression in Hamilton, Ontario where he lived with his wife Katherine. He would drive across Southern Ontario, to the shores of Georgian Bay, through Haliburton, Muskoka and Algonquin Park painting in all seasons, in all kinds of weather. He ventured to paint the Rockies several years, and even travelled abroad to Nassau and the British Isles. He also marked the times by painting scenes of the Hamilton Farmer's Market, the Royal yacht Brittania in Hamilton Harbour and documenting the Steel City in all its elements and growth. He used various empty buildings in Hamilton for his one- man shows, once renting the old Birks building for an exhibition in 1933 where he sold eight paintings during the first four days. However, it was a visit to the gallery by Sara D. Roosevelt, mother of Franklin D. Roosevelt, that really boosted his fortunes as the The Mail and Empire reported that Mrs. Roosevelt had purchased a small seascape. The artist sold 18 more pictures in the following two days. Early in his lengthy career, he was hired by Cootes- Hallmark to produce a painting of a winter scene each year, to be reproduced for Christmas cards and sold nationally. He was a long-standing member of the Allied Artists of America (one of a handful of Canadians ever to be elected), as well as an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy. He was a member of the board of trustees for the National Gallery in Ottawa for six years. He painted up until the last weeks of his life, dying at 87 in 1992. In 1996 Frank Panabaker was inducted into the Hamilton Gallery of Distinction. In 2019 the Hamilton_Wentworth District School Board announced that the new school in Ancaster Ontario replacing Fessenden Public School and Ancaster Senior Public School would be named Frank Panabaker Public School.

It was released for NEC Corporation's PC-8801 and PC-9801 home computers on December 22, 1989, followed by conversions for the X68000 (released on December 6, 1990), MSX2 (released on December 26 of the same year) and FM Towns (released on May 28, 1992). Developer Alfa System later produced console versions of the game for the PC Engine in Super CD-ROM¬≤ format (released on January 28, 1994) and the Super Famicom (released on July 28, 1995). The game features characters and locations based on Zoroastrian mythology. Gameplay Screenshot from the Super Famicom version. The game utilises a top-down overhead perspective, where players move the controllable character in two dimensions. As the player moves around in a world map, he or she may encounter battles which are turn-based with a time point system: both movements and attacks sap a bar on the top of the screen, and the character's turn ends when the bar is depleted. As this is a role-playing game, experience points are collected for defeating enemies which are used to level-up playable characters. For the main protagonist, Atorushan, stronger attacks are made available through key items collected in the game called the Emerald Graces. These transform him into a dragon to unleash a powerful attack, at the cost of reducing his HP when used. Plot A long time ago, dragons and humans lived in peace in the land of Ishbahn. Lord Tiridates, believing the existence of dragons among humans defiles Ishbahn, places a curse that kills dragons in the area. Some of the dragons (now collectively called the Dragon Tribe) manage to escape and find refuge in Draguria, where a dimensional rift prevents humans from crossing it. At the start of the game, a ship wrecks on the coast of Draguria. The protagonist, a Dragon Tribe youth named Atorushan seeks the friendship of the sole survivor, a human girl named Tamryn by the White Dragon, leader of the tribe. The girl is nurtured by the dragons of the land, but 12 years later she leaves as she wants to find happiness with those of her own kind. Atorushan breaks off his left horn and gives it to her as a means of summoning him should she need assistance. 3 years after this incident, Atorushan is called by the White Dragon as the aforementioned horn was blown. Granting him a silver scale to keep him from perishing under the curse of Ishbahn, the White Dragon sends him there to tend to Tamryn. Upon arriving, Atorushan learns that the entirety of Ishbahn is under attack by evil armies controlled by Tiridates. To stop him and remove the land's curse, he needs to find the 5 Emerald Graces, dragon-based treasures scattered around the land, and resurrect the Emerald Dragon, the greatest of all dragons destined to bring about a miracle. Sequel Akihiro Kimura successfully crowdfunded a sequel audio series titled Elemental Dragoon in 2015. http://vermillionmode.x0.com/ed2/main.html It is based on ideas that were proposed for a sequel to Emerald Dragon back in the 1990s but never got off the ground due to apparent copyright issues (though Kimura and others made several independent d≈çjinshi and novels continuing the story over the years). The series was designed to get around copyright issues (by focusing on new characters and slightly changing names such as the title, though the original characters appear at the end) and to hopefully allow Akihiro Kimura to generate interest for a true sequel to Emerald Dragon and regain the copyright.

As of September 2019, Bowlero Corporation is also the parent company of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA). The company's main bowling center brands in the United States include its namesake Bowlero, Bowlmor Lanes, and the legacy AMF Bowling brands.

The new company was jointly owned by Bowlmor, certain of AMF Bowling's second lien lenders including an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, and Credit Suisse. At time of the merger, the merged company operated 272 bowling centers and had 7,500 employees and a combined annual revenue of approximately $450 million. In the AMF Bowling reorganization, AMF's second lien lenders converted their debt into equity in Bowlmor AMF. Credit Suisse provided a $230 million term loan facility and a $30 million revolving loan facility, and the largest holders of AMF's existing second lien debt provided $50 million of backstop financing to provide working capital for Bowlmor AMF and to pay cash distributions in varying amounts to AMF's other creditors. AMF's first lien lenders received payment in full, in cash, of principal, interest at the non-default rate, and their fees. Bowlmor Founder and CEO Tom Shannon became Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President of the combined company, and Bowlmor's Chief Financial Officer and former president, Brett Parker, became Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer, and Executive Vice President. Shannon and Parker collectively retained 22% of Bowlmor AMF and were set to receive bonuses based on their ability to increase the profitability and worth of Bowlmor AMF. As part of the AMF Bowling reorganization, Bowlmor AMF assumed control of AMF Bowling's 50% interest in QubicaAMF Worldwide, one of the largest manufacturers of bowling products in the world. In December 2014 the Qubica founders and partners acquired this interest from Bowlmor AMF. In July 2014, the company announced that it had agreed to acquire all 85 centers of Brunswick Bowling & Billiards in a transaction to be financed by the sale and leaseback of 58 of the centers to iStar Financial, as well as a term loan. The acquisition was completed in September 2014. Shannon was named Bowling Proprietor of the Year in 2014 by Bowlers Journal International Magazine in recognition of his \\"vision and bold initiatives\\" to \\"divide the AMF bowling empire into three distinct brands.\\" In June 2017, private equity firm Atairos Group paid in excess of $1 billion to acquire Bowlmor AMF from its previous investors, with Shannon continuing to hold his \\"significant investment.\\" Bowlmor AMF changed its name to Bowlero Corporation on January 4, 2018. On September 10, 2019, Bowlero Corporation announced it had purchased the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA). While retaining current PBA Commissioner Tom Clark, Bowlero also appointed its Chief Customer Officer, Colie Edison, to the new role of CEO for the PBA. In an interview with Lucas Wiseman, senior editor for the PBA's FloBowling channel, Edison noted that Bowlero had been in talks with the PBA leadership for a number of years, before finally deciding the time was right for the acquisition. By January 2020, all remaining Brunswick locations were rebranded with either the Bowlero or AMF names. On October 9, 2020, Bowlero Corporation was featured on the American TV Series \\"Undercover Boss.\\"  Banners  Bowlero Corporation operates bowling centers under several banners: *Bowlero centers are positioned as traditional bowling centers for open bowling, group events, and leagues, with a \\"hip, fun environment\\". Most Bowlero centers are converted AMF or Brunswick Zone centers, while a few are newly constructed or were previously operated under another name by other owners. The brand was introduced in 2014 as a renovation of the AMF Woodlands Lanes in The Woodlands, Texas, featuring \\"recreational games and inventive menu items set in an eclectic environment that's full of nostalgic throwbacks.\\" *Bowlmor Lanes is positioned as a high-end banner designed solely for group events and open play, featuring lounge-styled settings and other food and entertainment options, including recreational games, private party facilities with catering services, sports bars, and full-service restaurants. Its Times Square New York location serves as a flagship, featuring multiple areas themed on various aspects of New York City culture, a dance floor, and a mini-golf course. The company claims the Bowlmor brand has a 35-50% return on equity. *AMF centers are carried over from the company's purchase of AMF Bowling, and are positioned as traditional bowling centers where bowling leagues play a significant role. Many former AMF locations have been converted to the Bowlero banner, while some have been sold (generally for non-bowling use). Bowlero Corporation acquired from private owners in 2018 and 2019 a few centers which it continues to operate under their existing business names. Examples include Revel & Roll in Michigan, and The Garage in Washington state. Controversies From the 1960s through the early 1980s, league bowling (a weekly group event where several teams bowl against each other over the course of a season) amounted to 75% to 80% of every bowling center's business in the United States. By 2012, that percentage had dropped to 21%. Lifestyle changes in the last few decades have made league bowling less attractive. Additionally, many bowling center owners have shifted their focus to casual bowlers, who bowl at non-discounted prices and spend more on food and beverage, and to special events, which produce substantial revenue and introduce new customers to the center. When Bowlmor Lanes purchased its first center in 1997 to renovate and upscale it, league bowling was eliminated \\"to ease out regulars who did not cotton to the fancy trappings or the higher prices.\\" That strategy proved so successful that league bowling was not offered at the five other centers the company added, and by 2012 Bowlmor was one of the highest grossing bowling facility operators in North America. When Bowlmor and AMF Bowling combined in 2013, league bowlers at AMF's existing 262 traditional bowling centers worried that the new owner would eliminate league bowling at their centers, too. Some cited a Bloomberg TV interview in which CEO Tom Shannon said, \\"I don‚Äôt think anyone takes bowling seriously ‚Äì why would you?\\" Concern grew when Bowlmor AMF significantly cut the operating hours at many centers as a financial measure, and in the process, displaced or eliminated some daytime bowling leagues. Shannon was said to have responded that, \\"We plan to increase the league bowling business, not shrink it,\\" citing AMF's \\"large customer base\\" in league activity for declaring that its league bowling was \\"very safe.\\" He said his company has \\"protected and defended 99% of (its) nighttime leagues\\" and sees its acquisition of the Brunswick centers as \\"furthering (its) commitment to league play.\\" A company spokeswoman further stated that the company also aims to \\"introduce a new generation to league bowling\\" and wants to support professional bowling, including possible sponsorships of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA). In October 2014 the PBA entered into an entitlement partnership agreement that will make the company an official partner of the PBA. In September 2019, Bowlero Corporation purchased the PBA. In December 2004, Shannon said his company was severing ties with a group tied to the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and was returning its $1.3 million investment. In August 2010, five ex-employees of Bowlmor Lanes location in Manhattan's Union Square sued Shannon claiming they were dismissed because of discrimination. They also alleged that Shannon used networking sites Facebook and MySpace to screen out minorities and others he felt weren't desirable for his club. By 2017 the company was facing further scrutiny and more than 50 lawsuits from former employees at various company locations who claimed to have been terminated for their appearance.

It is the only known order of basidiomycete fungi composed entirely of lichenized members. Morphologically, the fruiting bodies of all species are clavarioid. Six species are known, five of which were described within the span of 2007‚Äì2013. Due to its morphological similarity to the genus Multiclavula, its isolated phylogenetic position (distinct from all other orders based on molecular data) was not understood until quite recently. The photobionts that have been found in association with members of this group are not known to associate with any other types of lichenized fungi. Taxonomy Members of Lepidostromatales closely resemble species of Multiclavula because these groups share a combination of clavarioid fruiting bodies and lichenized thalli. The first species described in the order was originally described in the genus Clavaria due to the clavarioid fungal fruiting body, and was later transferred to Multiclavula (Cantharellales) due to the lichenized thallus. The group was first recognized as distinct on account of the small squamules (scale-like structures) that make up the thallus, and the genus Lepidostroma was created as a result. With the addition of two more squamulose species discovered in tropical Africa, this separation was not accepted and Multiclavula was again emended to include species with squamulose thalli. However, molecular phylogenetic analyses eventually confirmed Lepidostroma as a distinct lineage, Lepidostromataceae, unrelated to Multiclavula. The recent discovery of three further species (for a total of six species), created an opportunity for more in-depth phylogenetic research, which confirmed the isolation of the family from all described orders. As a result, the group was raised to the rank of order (Lepidostromatales). Although the separation of this group from Multiclavula was originally based on thallus type, further research has demonstrated that members of the group actually have three distinct thallus types, one of which ('crustose-granulose') matches up with Multiclavula. However, the photobiont of Lepidostromatales is chlorococcoid instead of coccomyxoid (which is the type found in Multiclavula), making the photobiont-type a reasonable diagnostic feature for the group. The three thallus types correlate with the current division of the group into three genera. Habitat and distribution All known members of the order are lichenized and grow on soil in tropical regions of Africa and the Americas.

They claimed descent from the Sasanian dynasty, and were closely related to the Abbasid caliphs by marriage.  History  According to Ibn al-Nadim, the Banu al-Munajjim were descended from Mihr- Gushnasp, a son of the last Sasanian king Yazdegerd III (r. 632‚Äì651). The family is first mentioned in the 9th century, when the eponymous ancestor of the family, Abu Mansur al-Munajjim (originally named Aban-Gushnasp), worked at the court of the second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (r. 754‚Äì775) as an astrologer (al-munajjim). His son, Yahya, worked at the Abbasid court under al-Ma'mun (r. 813‚Äì833), and later converted from Zoroastrianism to Islam. Yahya had four sons named Ali, Sa'id, Abdallah, and Hasan. These four sons would, like their father, work at the Abbasid court. Ali even befriended the caliph al-Mutawakkil (r. 847‚Äì861), and his son Yahya did the same with al- Muwaffaq, the de facto regent for his brother al-Mu'tamid (r. 870‚Äì892). One of Ali's other sons, Harun, also worked at the Abbasid court. Harun had a son named Ali, who eventually served under the Buyids when they became the new rulers of Baghdad. He is the last known member of the family.  Sources  *D. Pingree. \\"Banu Monajjem\\". Encyclopaedia Iranica. Ed. Ehsan Yarshater. Columbia University.
