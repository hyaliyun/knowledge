Faerber is known for his work on Generation X and New Warriors for Marvel Comics, and The Titans and Connor: Spotlight for DC Comics. He later wrote his own creator-owned titles for Image Comics, including Noble Causes, Dynamo 5, Near Death and Copperhead. He was also a writer on the TV series Ringer, Star- Crossed and Zoo. Currently he writes for The CW TV series Supergirl. Early life and influences Faerber grew up in northeastern Pennsylvania, and spent a considerable amount of his childhood in the Seattle area.\\"About\\". jayfaerber.com. Retrieved September 1, 2014.Faerber, Jay. \\"Under the Influence\\", Dynamo 5 #13 (May 2008), Image Comics, p. 24 His early interest in superheroes was sparked by TV series such as Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, the Adam West Batman series and the 1960s The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure, which featured his first exposure to the Teen Titans. This led to Faerber's interest in comic books, beginning with Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez's The New Teen Titans #25 in 1982, the first comic book with which he discovered that medium's more mature storylines and detailed artwork. Faerber's view of the series' ability, at the time, to stand on its own without requiring reading the related titles influenced Faerber's stated practice of keeping his own creator-owned books independent of one another, in order to avoid obligating readers of one of his titles to read the others in order to comprehend the storyline. The title also led to Faerber's interest in many other titles, such as Marvel Comics' Uncanny X-Men. During the early part of his childhood, Faerber would buy his comics from a local pharmacy, which limited his reading to Marvel and DC Comics. For Christmas 1986, Faerber, a high school freshman, was taken by his mother to his first comic book shop, Gema Books, where he discovered books from companies other than the Big Two, such as Elementals, Miracleman and The New Wave, the latter of which impressed him with its experimental biweekly, 16-page format, its emphasis on character depth over physical combat, and the originality of the character's personalities.Faerber, Jay. \\"Under the Influence\\", Dynamo 5: Sins of the Father #3 (August 2010), Image Comics, Page 26 As a child, Faerber would write and draw his own comics, though he assumed that writing was merely a means to provide something for him to draw. This changed by his first or second year of high school, when he discovered the TV series Spenser: For Hire, and later, the novels on which it was based by Robert B. Parker, whom Faerber names as the biggest single influence on his career as a writer.Faerber, Jay. \\"Under the Influence\\". Near Death #1. Image Comics. September 2011.

Page 21 and Riptide, the humor, intelligence and pace of the first Spenser novel he read, Ceremony, had such an effect on him that he tried writing a prose mystery story starring a private eye from one of his comics, which he let his English teacher read. The teacher, Maureen Purcell, the daughter of Golden Age comics artist Howard Purcell, praised Faerber's story. Faerber continued drawing, but concentrated more on prose writing. He was accepted as an art major at a local community college, but dropped out after one semester, when an instructor told him he needed to learn how to draw in order to draw comics. Realizing that his abilities lay in writing, he switched majors.

The book had already been cancelled, so the editor had no compunction about hiring him to write the final issue. Faerber's first ongoing series writing assignment was Generation X, which he began with issue #45 (December 1998).Generation X #45. Grand Comics Database. accessed September 1, 2011. Assignments on The New Warriors and The Titans would follow. In 2002, Faerber began publishing through Image Comics the series Noble Causes, which follows the lives of the Nobles, a wealthy superhero family, and which emphasized their interpersonal conflicts over battles with supervillain enemies. The series lasted until 2008, and concluded with issue #40.Sullivan, Michael Patrick. Faerber Concludes \\"Noble Causes\\". Comic Book Resources.

In 2007, Faerber debuted the Noble Causes spinoff, Dynamo 5, which starred a group of five illegitimate of the assassinated superhero Captain Dynamo, who were assembled by Dynamo's widow in order to protect Tower City. Like Noble Causes, Dynamo 5 was also a monthly series by Image Comics that depicted the superhero family dynamics, but placed more emphasis on action, dividing its content between the team's battles with adversaries and its interpersonal conflicts. Dynamo 5 ended its ongoing run with issue #25 (Oct. 2009), and continued with a series of miniseries and one-shots. In 2008, Faerber published a miniseries called Gemini, which stars Dan Johnson, an ordinary man who is unaware that at night, he comes under the control of an organization called the Constellation, who transform ordinary people like him into crimefighters named after star constellations, without any of these people retaining any knowledge or memory of these events.CBR Preview.

August 19, 2008 the last issue published was issue #4 (July 2009), which featured a guest appearance by Dynamo 5. In September 2011, Faerber debuted Near Death, a crime series whose lead character, Markham, is an assassin who sets out to atone for his past sins after capturing a glimpse of hell during a near-death experience. During the course of the book, which mostly consists of self- contained stories, Markham saves people's lives (some of whom are targeted by other hitmen working for his former clients), not because his near-death experience made him a more altruistic person, but solely because of his self- interested motive in avoiding hell, a point with which Faerber hopes to explore questions of moral character and the nature of heroism. In creating the series, Faerber was inspired by the work of Andrew Vachss, Robert B. Parker, Robert Crais and Lee Child, and 80s crime shows such as The Equalizer and Stingray. In particular, the lack of any known first name for Markham is inspired by Vachss' Burke series and Parker's Spenser. It is Faerber's first series that does not feature any science fiction or fantasy elements, as it is a straight-crime drama.Weiland, Jonah (July 9, 2014). \\"CBR TV: Jay Faerber on Creator-Owned Appeal, \\"Copperhead's\\" Western Roots\\".

He uses GoodReader on his iPad, and the Adonit Jot Pro stylus to write notes on scripts written by himself or others.

Originally intended to be an ongoing title, it was downgraded into a series of miniseries and one-shots. It finally became an ongoing title in 2004. Beginning with issue #32, the series jumped five years after the previous storyline.

August 19, 2008Arrant, Chris. \\"The Other Family of Superheroes: Retiring NOBLE CAUSES\\". Newsarama. August 3, 2010 Cast of characters =The Nobles= *Dr. Dudley \\"Doc\\" Noble: Patriarch of the Noble family. A two-fisted scientist seemingly more at ease with machines than with other people, Doc will nevertheless go to any lengths he deems necessary to defend his family. He has access to a vast supply of advanced weaponry and equipment, which he can access with simple verbal commands (e.g. \\"Gun\\" brings him an energy gun; \\"Jet Pack\\" brings him a jet pack, etc.) Doc was initially married to Gaia, but divorced her after discovering her involvement in a monster that terrorized the city. He later married Olympia, but experienced difficulties when he discovered that he still had feelings for Gaia. Olympia left Doc with an ultimatum of choosing either her or Gaia. The series ends with Doc making a phone call to an unknown woman telling her that she's the one he \\"wants to be with\\". *Gaia Noble: The family matriarch. A sorceress from another dimension who can command the four classical elements, Gaia is also incredibly media savvy and is responsible for positioning the Noble family into the public spotlight. She‚Äôs extremely concerned with how things look to the public and goes to great lengths to ensure that the family's image remains intact. When the Blackthornes began to gain more attention than the Noble family, Gaia unleashed a monster for her family to fight and once again gain the public spotlight. This later backfired when Liz regained her memories, which included seeing Gaia give the monster instructions. As a result, Gaia and Doc divorced and Gaia spent multiple years in jail. Upon her release Gaia informed Doc that she intended to win back his heart. *Russell \\"Rusty\\" Noble: Doc and Gaia's first-born child, Rusty's brain was placed in a robotic body due to a battle with a robotic assassin that would have otherwise killed him. Rusty dislikes being in the public spotlight, which contributed to his eventual divorce with Celeste Noble. He later dates Cosmic Rae, a young woman with magnetic abilities that was secretly an android. Upon discovering this, Rusty tried to find the \\"real Rae\\". His mission led him to a robotics genius who was a federal witness. The ensuing battle ended with a number of police officers being injured and the deaths of a news helicopter crew. Rusty spent some time in jail and was eventually freed, where he resumed working with the current roster of Nobles. Five years in the future it is shown that Rusty has become a seemingly emotionless being, only showing emotion when Frost is injured and when the widow of the man he killed attempts revenge. *Frost: Gaia's son from an extramarital affair and the black sheep of the family. Aside from Gaia, each member of the family treats him with varying degrees of scorn. To the general public, Frost is something of an urban legend. He lives in seclusion in a large ice castle near the Aurora Borealis. Frost has the power of cold manipulation as well as the ability to transform into a cool mist, and always has an agenda when it comes to the Nobles (except for Gaia, to whom he's extremely loyal). He even went so far as to have an affair with Celeste while she was married to Rusty. He often hires himself out as a troubleshooter, even doing jobs for the U.S and Canadian governments. It was revealed that his father was actually a parallel universe version of \\"Doc\\". *Race Noble: Doc and Gaia's second-born son. Smart, handsome and charming, super-fast Race is considered the \\"golden boy\\" of the family. In the original miniseries, he was killed off while on his honeymoon. At the end of Noble Causes: Distant Relatives #4, he was returned to life in a twist similar to Bobby Ewing's resurrection. Now, he is the target of a revenge plot formulated by the Blackthornes, the Nobles' criminal counterparts. Years ago, during a fight between the two families, Race was battling Pierce Blackthorne when a misstep caused Pierce to fall to his death. Race failed to save Pierce and therefore was blamed by Hunter Blackthorne. The event haunts Race to this day. A recent attack by the super-powered assassin Widowmaker has robbed him of his super-speed abilities. *Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Donnelly-Noble: Race's wife and the only normal member of the family. An ordinary Georgetown bookseller, she met Race when he disrupted a signing at her bookstore. Possessing no super-powers or exotic background, Liz is the proverbial stranger in a strange land. Her only special gifts are common sense and a willingness to speak her mind. On more than one occasion, she has shown that she can go toe-to-toe verbally with any member of the family, particularly Celeste. Liz was recently the assumed target of the Blackthorne family's revenge plot. A mishap occurred in the experiment intended to restore Race's powers, causing her to be hit with a tachyon stream and vanish. While travelling along the tachyon stream, she visited a number of alternate futures. Afterwards, she awoke in the present with amnesia, unable to remember the Nobles. *Zephyr Noble: Doc and Gaia's only daughter, and their youngest child. She has the power of air manipulation, and can be considered the wild child of the family, having once made a sex tape which was subsequently released on the internet. She later revealed to Liz that this tape was filmed while an innocent girl was being held at gunpoint, but due to the emotional damage Zephyr began a pattern of self-destructive behaviour which culminated in her becoming pregnant as the result of a tryst with her family's nemesis Draconis. Recently, she gave birth, but the baby was stillborn... or so she was led to believe. In reality, the doctor was paid by Necrona Blackthorne to help kidnap the baby. To escape from pressure caused by her public life, she has adopted an alternate persona (ironically enough, the prostitute that dressed up as her for Krennick). Zephyr often hangs out with Invincible, Shadowhawk and Firebreather. Eventually, as of issue #32, she was able to win Slate's affection, marrying him and turning her husband to the side of the angels. *Celeste Noble: Rusty's ex-wife, a publicity-hungry diva who possesses stellar energy-based powers. Undergoing extensive cosmetic surgery and receiving her powers from a think tank known as the Winterbourne Institute, Celeste attracted Rusty's attention by staging fights with supervillains she herself hired. Celeste seems to have married into the family more for the status than for love. She even dallied with Frost behind Rusty's back. It's been revealed that Celeste, much to her own surprise, has genuinely fallen in love with Dawn Blackthorne, with whom she's been pursuing a clandestine lesbian relationship. Her relationship with Dawn ends after Celeste kills Kitty, Dawn's mother, out of pity, believing her condition could not be cured. *Olympia Noble: Doc's second wife. Appeared in issue #32 as the second wife of Doc, she's superhumanly strong and beautiful, with an outgoing personality. *Minutiae: Olympia's geeky daughter. She has powers similar to the DC Comics heroes The Atom and Atom Girl in that she can alter her own mass and size, shrinking to subatomic level. She shares the same interest in science as Doc, helping him with his inventions. *Surge: Olympia's son. He is the classical \\"angry young man\\" who would disagree with Doc if Doc told him rain was wet, a Johnny Storm-like hothead with energy-based powers. *Slate Blackthorne: The youngest of the Blackthorne family. Able to transform into a super-strong rock-like form with incredible resistance to harm, Slate has no real desire to follow in his family's footsteps, so he secretly performs good deeds (e.g. hiding Widowmaker in a safehouse under the pretense that he killed her). He is Zephyr's next door neighbor. Initially, both were unaware of each other's alter-ego. As of issue #32 they married, and finally Slate becomes able to leave his villainous ways to be the hero he wanted to. =The Blackthornes= *Hunter Blackthorne: A dark sorcerer, and patriarch of the Blackthorne family. Just released on parole, Hunter is plotting an elaborate revenge scheme against Race, whom he blames for the death of his son Pierce. That plan resulted in Race losing his super-speed and the public now viewing the Blackthornes as being reformed. After Kitty's death, he accepted Race's offer to reunite him with her and Pierce in an alternate reality. *Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Blackthorne: The matriarch of the Blackthorne family. In order to bolster her natural feral abilities, she drank a special elixir of Hunter's creation. If she took too much, she would mutate into a savage cat-like beast. Unfortunately, she developed an addiction to it. In her cat-beast form, she terrorized the streets of Crowns Pointe at night. Eventually, the elixir became part of her system and she was transforming without it. A cure was created, but too late as, after a rampage, she begged Celeste to end her misery. Reluctantly, Celeste decapitated Kitty with a stellar energy blast. *Mercury Blackthorne: The oldest of the Blackthorne children. After Pierce, Mercury's younger brother, died, he became mute. Mercury can alter his body's density from diamond-hard to intangible. He is the first member of the Blackthorne family to actually appear in the comic (issue #4 of the ongoing). *Necrona Blackthorne: Krennick's long-lost half-sister, current ruler of the Underworld and secretly Mercury's wife. It was revealed that Draconis had often ordered any daughters he had sired to be immediately put to death. Necrona's mother managed to spirit her away to a distant part of the Underworld. She made herself known when Krennick was suspected of murdering Gretchen Lewis. She kidnapped Zephyr's baby under the pretense that it was stillborn, raising it as her own. Like many of her people, Necrona possesses superhuman strength and durability, in addition to the ability to project fire from her hands. *Dusk and Dawn Blackthorne: Twins who can manipulate darkness and light manipulation respectively. Dusk resents Dawn, who, in her eyes, is the family favorite. She has also shown rather impulsive behavior, such as when she ambushed Zephyr Noble in the neighborhood she recently moved into. Dawn, on the other hand, values her family and her love life and keeps them very close to the vest. She works hard to keep her family together although she sometimes struggles to protect her secret lesbian relationship with Celeste Noble, which has since ended due to Celeste's mercy killing of Kitty. =Supporting cast= *Krennick: Son of Draconis, ruler of the Underworld, a subterranean realm. Once an enemy of the Nobles alongside his father, he and Race became friends after both men were trapped in an alternate dimension for a year. Krennick became a surrogate member of the Noble family. Infatuated with Zephyr to the point of obsession, he often hired prostitutes to impersonate her. Recently, Krennick was the prime suspect in the murder of Gretchen Lewis, one of the prostitutes Krennick employed. The revelation of Krennick's predilections has strained his friendships with both Zephyr and Race. After the discovery of the true murderer, Krennick turned rulership of the Underworld over to his newfound sister Necrona. Like many of his people, Krennick possesses superhuman strength and durability, in addition to the ability to project fire from his hands. He is also a highly skilled warrior. *Clarion: Gaia's friend and confidant. Seen in a number of back-up stories, it was Clarion who raised Frost alongside her own son. Very little is known about Clarion, including whatever powers she may possess. It is possible that she may hail from the same dimension as Gaia. *Cosmic Rae: An African-American superheroine, Rusty begins dating soon after his divorce from Celeste. Rae can control magnetism, including manipulating metals which are susceptible to that force. While on a mission in space, it is discovered by Frost that Rae is actually a robot. Frost keeps her secret in exchange for her doing him a favor in the future. Rusty recently assaulted Rae upon discovering this, ripping one of her arms off in the process. Doc secretly revealed to Gaia that he created Rae so that Rusty could have someone to love. *Detective Ryan O'Mega: A detective in the superhuman crimes division of the Crown Pointe police department. O'Mega has various forms of superhuman vision (infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray, etc.). The downside is he needs special glasses to keep his vision powers in check, or they overwhelm him. After investigating the murder of Gretchen Lewis, he briefly became romantically involved with Zephyr.

Based on the 1943 novel by Graham Greene, the film tells the story of a man just released from a mental asylum who finds himself caught up in an international spy ring and pursued by Nazi agents after inadvertently receiving something they want. The original music for the film was composed by Victor Young. Plot In wartime England during the Blitz, Stephen Neale (Ray Milland) is released from Lembridge Asylum. While waiting for a train to London, Neale visits a village f√™te hosted by the Mothers of Free Nations charity. He guesses the weight of a cake for a shilling, apparently failing to guess the cake's true weight, and is urged to go to the palm reader's tent to have his fortune told by Mrs. Bellane (Aminta Dyne), an older woman. He asks her to ignore the past and tell the future, which startles her. She cryptically tells him to take another guess at the weight of the cake at 4 pounds 15¬Ω ounces. Neale does so and wins the prize, the cake itself. Then a young blond man hurries to see Mrs. Bellane. People try to persuade Neale to give the cake to the blond man, but Neale refuses, as his initial guess was closer to the cake's true weight than the blond man's guess, by a few ounces. Neale departs Lembridge with only a blind man (Eustace Wyatt) sharing his train compartment. Neale offers him some cake. Neale sees the blind man crumbling his portion. When the train stops during a Luftwaffe air raid, Neale's companion turns out not to be blind after all. He strikes Neale with his walking stick, steals the cake, and flees, with Neale in pursuit. The man shoots at him, but is killed by a German bomb. Neale finds the man's revolver and continues on to London. Neale hires private detective George Rennit (Erskine Sanford) to help him investigate the Mothers of Free Nations. Neale meets Willi Hilfe (Carl Esmond) and his sister Carla (Marjorie Reynolds), refugees from Nazi Austria who run the charity. Willi takes him to Mrs. Bellane's London mansion (followed by Rennit). Neale is shocked to discover that this Mrs. Bellane (Hillary Brooke) is a beautiful young medium. She invites them to stay for her s√©ance. Among the other attendees are artist Martha Panteel (Mary Field), psychiatrist Dr. Forrester (Alan Napier), and Mr. Cost (Dan Duryea), the blond man at the f√™te. After the lights are dimmed, a mysterious voice claims she was poisoned by Neale, disconcerting him. Then a shot rings out ‚Äì Cost is found shot dead. Neale admits to having the blind man's gun. He flees with Willi's help. Neale goes to Rennit's office, only to find it ransacked. He talks to Carla. An air raid forces the two to shelter in an Underground station, where Neale reveals that he had planned to euthanize his terminally ill wife. He changed his mind, but she committed suicide anyway, using poison he had bought. Due to the circumstances, Neale received a light sentence of two years at the asylum. He confides that he is still unsure if in buying the poison for his wife he had made the right decision. The next morning, Carla hides Neale at a friend's bookstore. Neale spots a book by Forrester, The Psychoanalysis of Nazidom. Carla reveals that Forrester is one of her volunteers as well as a consultant for the Ministry of Home Security. Neale is convinced that Carla's organization is a front for Nazi spies. Carla finds out that almost all the people Neale suspects are charity volunteers, but all recommended by Forrester. She tells Willi about her discovery, and admits that she loves Neale. That afternoon, Neale goes to Panteel's flat, only to find Mrs. Bellane. The two verbally spar. He flees when Panteel returns and begins screaming for the police. Later, Carla tells Neale what she has learned. The bookseller asks the couple to deliver some books in a suitcase since they are leaving. When they arrive at the address, they discover that no one lives there. Suspicious, Neale opens the suitcase. The bomb inside explodes, but Neale's quick reaction saves them both. Neale awakens in the hospital, the prisoner of Scotland Yard Inspector Prentice (Percy Waram). Neale persuades Prentice to search the bombed-out cottage for evidence. About to be taken to jail, at the last minute Neale finds a microfilm of military secrets inside a portion of the cake hidden in a bird's nest. Officials insist that the top secret documents have only been taken out of a safe twice, the second time when Forrester's tailor, a man named Travers, was present. Neale recalls that the empty flat was leased in Travers' name. Prentice and Neale go to the tailor's shop, and find that Travers is Cost. Travers pretends not to recognize Neale, and calls a client about a suit. Then, seeing he is trapped, he commits suicide. When Neale dials the number he saw Travers use, Carla answers. Neale slips away to confront Carla. Willi emerges, armed with a pistol, and admits he is the head of the spy ring. Another copy of the microfilm is sewn into the suit he received from Travers. Carla throws a candlestick, striking her brother's gun hand. The two men struggle, and Carla picks up the gun. When she refuses to hand it over to Willi, he tries to flee, but she shoots him dead. Forrester and several other Nazi agents chase Neale and Carla onto the roof. Inspector Prentice arrives and kills the remaining Nazis. Later, Carla and Neale drive in the country, talking about their wedding. Neale is comically horrified when she mentions planning the \\"cake\\". Cast * Ray Milland as Stephen Neale * Marjorie Reynolds as Carla Hilfe * Carl Esmond as Willi Hilfe/Mr. Macklin * Hillary Brooke as Mrs. Bellane #2 * Percy Waram as Inspector Prentice * Dan Duryea as Cost/Travers * Alan Napier as Dr. Forrester * Erskine Sanford as George Rennit * Mary Field as Martha Penteel * Aminta Dyne as Mrs. Bellane #1 Comparison with the novel Graham Greene's protagonist, Arthur Rowe (Stephen Neale in the film), is profoundly tormented with guilt for his having murdered his wife. In the movie, that is a simple mercy killing, an assisted suicide, and Neale holds his wife's hand as she passes away. In the book, Rowe slips the poison into his wife's milk ‚Äì \\"how queer it tastes,\\" she says ‚Äì and leaves her to die alone. Despite the official finding of a mercy killing, he believes \\"that somewhere there was justice, and justice condemned him.\\" He knows that the deed was not so much to end her suffering, as to end his own. This overwhelming sense of guilt, pervading the novel from beginning to end, is absent from the film. The film omits all of Rowe's incarceration in Dr Forester's private asylum with amnesia, after the bomb in the booby-trapped case of books explodes. Gradually he works out that the institution is run by Nazi agents and that inmates who find out too much are eliminated. Painful though it is to regain his memories, he realises that he must remember all he can and get out to inform the police. His love interest, Anna Hilfe (Carla Hilfe in the film), appears in Fritz Lang's movie to be uninvolved in her brother's spy activities. In the novel, she does not shoot her brother dead, and there is no rooftop shootout with Nazi agents. Her brother Willi Hilfe, armed with a gun with a single bullet, commits suicide, in a railway station lavatory, when he cannot escape. Anna (Carla) must forever fear exposure as a spy, just as Rowe (Neale) fears exposure as a murderer. They go on together, lovers, but hardly the happy and carefree couple portrayed in the film: \\"They had to tread carefully for a lifetime, never speak without thinking twice ... They would never know what it was not to be afraid of being found out.\\" That, not the spy pursuit of the film, is at the heart of Graham Greene's novel. Response In a contemporary review, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote positively of the film, stating that \\"Mr. Lang has given the picture something of the chilling quality of some of his early German shockers‚Äîa strangely arch and maniacal surge that comes through suggestive use of camera and morbid pace in more critical spots. The clammy and numbing sensations of fear are thereby conveyed in a manner that is quite unusual for our generally overworked screen.\\" Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader has praised the film, writing that \\"this 1944 thriller represents an epochal meeting of two masters of Catholic guilt and paranoia, novelist Graham Greene and director Fritz Lang. Ray Milland, just released from a sanitorium, finds the outside world more than a fit match for his delusions as he stumbles into an elaborate Nazi plot. The hallucinatory quality of the opening scene (an innocent country fair turns out to be a nest of spies) is reminiscent of Lang's expressionist films of the 20s, but this is a more mature, more controlled film, Lang at his finest and purest.\\" Judd Blaise, writing for Allmovie, states, \\"While it does not reach the same level of timeless classic as Carol Reed's adaptation of Greene's The Third Man four years later, Ministry of Fear stands as a well- made, thoroughly gripping and intelligent example of film noir.\\" References External links   Time Out London * Variety 1945 * Ministry of Fear on the NBC University Theater: January 23, 1949 *Ministry of Fear: Paranoid Style an essay by Glenn Kenny at the Criterion Collection Category:1944 films Category:1940s spy thriller films Category:American films Category:American spy thriller films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Film noir Category:Films scored by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa Category:Films scored by Victor Young Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films based on works by Graham Greene Category:Films directed by Fritz Lang Category:Films set in London Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:World War II films made in wartime ","title":"Ministry of Fear"},{"id":"2522953","text":"The Foreign Military Studies Office, or FMSO, is a research and analysis center for the United States Army that is part of the United States Army Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth. It manages the Joint Reserve Intelligence Center there. Mission The main purpose of FMSO is to conduct analysis relating to foreign military and security studies based upon open source research. FMSO's publications are available on its web site, and its researchers publish in many professional military and academic journals, where their products can be assessed in the market place of ideas. Originally created by LTG William Richardson, TRADOC Commander, as the Soviet Army Studies Office in 1986, SASO's first director was Dr. Bruce Menning. A primary area of focus was the development of operational art in the Soviet Union. Colonel David Glantz, a well-known author on the Soviet military experience in the Second World War, became its second director. FMSO was staffed by US Army foreign area officers and civilian scholars. With the end of the Cold War SASO became FMSO in 1991 and its focus initially broadened to Central and Eastern Europe.About David Glantz - consimworld.com - October 2, 1998 FMSO was actively involved in research on the end of the Cold War, the challenge of ethno-nationalism to Post-Cold War Europe, and relevant foreign military experience, such as the Soviet-Afghan War and the Wars in Chechnya. FMSO developed a research programs on Latin American military affairs, Chinese military studies, and Eurasian military studies. In the post Cold War era FMSO did address problems of asymmetric warfare. In the last decade it has also addressed the problem of integrating cultural insights into COIN and played a key role in the initial development of the Human Terrain System, and is an active partner of the controversial cultural geography mapping project called M√©xico Ind√≠gena. Operation Iraqi Freedom Documents Through the site, the US government made publicly available the Operation Iraqi Freedom Documents - some 55,000 boxes of documents, audiotapes and videotapes relating to the government of Saddam Hussein, seized during the Iraq invasion in 2003 for the purposes of Document Exploitation (DOCEX). However, in early November 2006, the entire set of documents was apparently removed. Media reports stated that the website was taken offline because the documents included sophisticated diagrams and other information detailing nuclear weapon design that could be useful to anyone wishing to construct a nuclear weapon.

The spies enter from the Negev desert and journey northward through the Judaean hills until they arrive at the brook of Eshcol near Hebron, where reside Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the sons of Anak. After the scouts have explored the entire land, they bring back samples of the fruit of the land; most notably a gigantic cluster of grapes which requires two men to carry it on a pole between them. The scouts then report to Moses and the congregation, that \\"the land indeed is a land flowing with milk and honey,\\" but ten of the twelve spies discourage the Israelites from even attempting to possess the land, for they reported that the men were taller and stronger than the Israelites, and moreover the sons of Anak dwell in the land, and that they felt like grasshoppers in their presence.

Essentially, this model is used to show undergraduate students how shifts in demand or shocks to prices can affect real GDP around potential.

It also assumes that when real GDP exceeds potential, there is upward pressure on the inflation rate and vice versa. The model features a downward- sloping demand curve (AD) and a horizontal inflation adjustment line (IA). The point where the two lines cross is equal to potential GDP.

The monetary policy rule is that the federal reserve increases interest rates in response to increase in inflation and vice versa. =Shifts in demand= A shift in demand can occur for the following reasons: * A change in government spending * A change in consumption * A change in taxes * A change in the monetary rule Example: Suppose the government were to cut taxes. This would lead to an increase in expenditures and thus an increase in demand. The demand curve would therefore shift to the right and real GDP would be growing above potential. The inflation adjustment line would then shift upward (reflecting an increase in the inflation rate) causing a movement along the new demand curve until real GDP was equal to potential.  More advanced  This model is further advanced in higher levels of undergraduate studies. David Romer proposed in 2000 that the LM curve be replaced in the IS‚ÄìLM model. Instead, Romer suggested that although the Federal Reserve uses open market operations to impact the federal funds rate, they are not targeting money supply, but rather the interest rate. Therefore, he suggests removing the LM curve and replacing it with the MP curve.

He is a cyborg with a human body and a metal elephant head. He serves the Heroic Warriors as a firefighter, his main power being to spray jets of water, stored in a special pack on his back, from his trunk, which he refills periodically from rivers and lakes. Character history =Cartoon= Snout Spout was introduced into the Masters of the Universe toy line in 1986. By the time his action figure was released, the accompanying cartoon series, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe had been cancelled to make way for its spin-off series, She-Ra: Princess of Power. Therefore, Snout Spout makes his cartoon appearances in She-Ra rather than He-Man. Appearing in 3 episodes: \\"Small Problems\\", \\"Out of the Cocoon\\" and \\"Day of the Flowers\\", Snout Spout's roles are little more than cameoes and he receives no real character development. Several continuity discrepancies also surround his character, as in his first episode he is referred to as \\"Hose Nose\\", this being Mattel's working name for the character, yet \\"Day of the Flowers\\" refers to him as Snout Spout with no explanation for the name change. His first two appearances also seem to indicate he lives on Etheria, yet the latter episode ties him in with Mattel's continuity by depicting him as He-Man's friend, visiting from Eternia. He also made a cameo in the He-Man & She-Ra Christmas Special, shown extending his snout to place the star on the tree. =2002 series= Snout Spout is never shown in the 200X cartoon series but Eternian firemen are shown in the accompanying comic series dressed like Snout Spout, the line was canceled before his figure could be released. In 2004, a mini statue of the character was produced by NECA. =Masters of the Universe Classics= In the Masters of the Universe Classics toyline, Jaxton was an Etherian peasant who was one of three gladiators captured by Hordak and thrown into the experimental matrix which grafted cybernetic parts to him. The other two were Dragstor and Extendar. He later escaped to Eternia and sided with He- Man. Other media Although the cartoon offers no kind of consistency to Snout Spout's character, other media producing Masters of the Universe stories throughout the 1980s give the character more exposure, as well as a background story. A Mattel promotional card states that he was formerly an Etherian peasant who was captured by Hordak and subjected to fiendish experiments which turned him into the elephantine cyborg he is today. Although initially intended to serve The Evil Horde, he managed to throw off Hordak's brainwashing attempt and escape to Eternia, where he joined He-Man and the Heroic Warriors. This backstory was adopted by the UK comic series published by London Editions, which introduces Snout Spout in a story entitled \\"The Unknown Warrior\\", in which he makes his way from Etheria to Eternia wearing a mask, refusing to remove his mask or reveal his identity until he has proved himself a worthy hero. He is presented in the comic series as insecure and paranoid about his appearance, yet never overly self-pitiful and determined to fight on against the Horde until he finds some way of returning to his human form. In the Star Comics series, he only had one major appearance, in issue #4, Snakes Alive. Here, he was shown as being in a constant, not-so-friendly rivalry with Rio Blast, with both characters constantly trying to belittle and outdo each other. Reception Snout Spout was voted No.5 in The 14 Least Masterful Masters of the Universe by Io9. Snout Spout was voted No.3 of 8 Crazy Masters of the Universe Figures.

Associated with the theater and film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, for whom she first worked in 1965, she was active in the New German Cinema. She won the 1979 Berlin Silver Bear for Best Actress for Fassbinder's The Marriage of Maria Braun, and the 1983 Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for the Marco Ferreri film The Story of Piera. Life and career Schygulla was born in K√∂nigsh√ºtte (now Chorz√≥w, Poland) to German parents Antonie (n√©e Mzyk) and Joseph Schygulla. Both the names Schygulla (also spelled Szygu≈Ça) and Mzyk are of Polish/Silesian origin. Her father, a timber merchant by profession, was drafted as an infantryman in the German Army and was captured by American forces in Italy, subsequently being held as a prisoner of war until 1948. In 1945, Schygulla and her mother arrived as refugees in Munich, following the expulsion of the majority German-speaking population of K√∂nigsh√ºtte by Communist Poland. Much later, in the 1960s, Schygulla studied Romance languages and German studies, while taking acting lessons in Munich during her spare time. Acting eventually became her focus, and she became particularly known for her film work with Rainer Werner Fassbinder. During the making of Effi Briest (1974), an adaptation of a German novel by Theodor Fontane, Fassbinder and Schygulla fell out over divergent interpretations of the character.Rosalind Hodgkiss \\"The bitter tears of Fassbinder's women\\", The Guardian, 8 January 1999; retrieved 22 February 2008. Another issue for Schygulla was low pay, and she led a revolt against Fassbinder during the making of Effi Briest, shot in September 1972 some time before its commercial release. His response was typically blunt: \\"I can't stand the sight of your face any more. You bust my balls\\".Derek Malcolm \\"Rainer Werner Fassbinder: The Marriage of Maria Braun\\", The Guardian, 28 January 1999; retrieved 2 March 2009. They did not work together again for several years until The Marriage of Maria Braun in 1978. The film was entered into the 29th Berlin International Film Festival, where she won the Silver Bear for Best Actress for her performance. In 1980 she acted in Fassbinder's miniseries adaptation of Berlin Alexanderplatz. Schygulla starred alongside Bruno Ganz in Volker Schl√∂ndorff's Circle of Deceit (1981), and with Isabelle Huppert in Jean-Luc Godard's Passion (1982). She was a member of the jury at the 15th Moscow International Film Festival in 1987. In the 1990s, she became a chanson singer. In Juliane Lorenz's documentary film Life, Love and Celluloid (1998), on Fassbinder and related topics, Schygulla performs several songs. Schygulla appeared in the B√©la Tarr film Werckmeister Harmonies (2000), and in VB51 (2002), a performance by the artist Vanessa Beecroft. Five years later, she appeared in the film The Edge of Heaven, directed by Fatih Akƒ±n. In 2007, she received the Honorary Award from the Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival and in 2010 she received the Honorary Golden Bear from the Berlin Film Festival. She acted in the Alexander Sokurov film Faust (2011) and in the French drama film The Prayer (2018) by C√©dric Kahn. It was screened in the main competition section at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival. Schygulla lived in Paris from 1981 to 2014, when she left for Berlin.

Biography Mewhirter was born in Sugar Grove, Illinois, USA, the son of Robert Mewhirter, and was educated in New Providence and at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. He graduated in pharmacy and chemistry, and moved to Canada in 1906. He became manager of the Gutta Percha and Rubber Co., Ltd. in Winnipeg, and resided in Dugald. In religion, Mewhirter was a Presbyterian. He was married three times: first to Nancy during the 1890s, then to Mary Moe in 1897, and later to Alma. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, defeating Liberal Thomas Glendenning Hamilton by 364 votes in the Elmwood constituency. The Conservatives won this election, and Mewhirter sat as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Roblin's government. In 1915, the Conservatives were forced to resign from office because a report commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor found the government guilty of corruption in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. A new election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. Mewhirter was not a candidate. Harry Mewhirter died in Elkton, Maryland on September 2, 1957.

Almost every Elvis Presley film contained one or more works written by Wayne and his partner Ben Weisman. His most known works are \\"See You In September\\" (co-written with Sherman Edwards), \\"It's Impossible\\" ‚Äî featuring the English lyric of Armando Manzanero's \\"Somos Novios\\" ‚Äî \\"Mangos\\" (with Dee Libbey), \\"Two Different Worlds\\" and \\"Relax Max\\" (with Al Frisch) and \\"I Need Your Love Tonight\\" (with Bix Reichner). Plus five songs co-written with Ben Weisman and Fred Karger for the soundtrack to the 1966 movie Hold On! featuring Herman's Hermits and Shelley Fabares. Hold On! includes \\"The George and Dragon\\", \\"Got a Feeling\\", \\"Wild Love\\", \\"Gotta Get Away\\" and \\"Make Me Happy\\", the latter of which was sung by Fabares. From 1960 to 1962, Wayne was the musical director of the CBS game show Video Village, which debuted shortly after the scandal-tainted rigged quizzes of the 1950s left the air. Born Sidney Weinberg in Brooklyn, New York on January 26, 1923,1966 ASCAP Biographical Dictionary Wayne, a self-taught musician had many successes in New York. In 1961, when Video Village moved from New York to Los Angeles, he moved his young family to West Hollywood, California to start the west coast phase of his career. There he teamed up with Weisman for work on the Elvis Presley films. As Elvis' film career tapered off, Wayne returned to his New York roots to have his biggest Grammy nominated hit with the Perry Como recording of \\"It's Impossible\\". This song, a love ballad for his wife Rhea, was commissioned as the English lyric to Manzanero's \\"Somos Novios\\". The English version, \\"It's Impossible\\", was originally performed by Perry Como and nominated for a Grammy Award in 1972. In 1980 Wayne relocated to Dallas, Texas, where he continued to write for commercial television and advertising with another songwriting partner, Stephen Arnold and Roger Howell (singer/songwriter).

Life and work Soldier with Country Women Selling Ribbons, near a Military Camp Wheatley was born at Wild Court, Covent Garden, London, the son of a master tailor. He studied at William Shipley's drawing school and the Royal Academy, and won several prizes from the Society of Arts. He assisted in the decoration of Vauxhall, and aided John Hamilton Mortimer in painting a ceiling for Lord Melbourne at Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire. In his youth, he lived a dissipated life. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1778, built up a good practice and was praised by the critics. But he fell in with extravagant company and was forced to flee his creditors: so he eloped to Ireland with Elizabeth Gresse, wife of a fellow artist John Alexander Gresse (1741‚Äì1794). In the summer of 1779 he was in Dublin with Elizabeth, whom he passed off as his wife, and established himself there as a portrait-painter, executing, among other works, the best- known interior of the Irish House of Commons. He also painted the review of the Dublin regiments of the Irish Volunteers in College Green in November 1779, the basis for a best-selling print bought by numerous Irish Patriot supporters. He was careful to include the grandees of Dublin and also exotic visitors such as Princess Dashkov. The circumstances of his private life were revealed, and he returned to London. He produced small landscapes, portraits, or street scenes, and began to work in imitation of the French painter Jean- Baptiste Greuze. His scene from the Gordon Riots of 1780 was engraved by James Heath; this was noted as one of his best, but was lost to a fire. He painted several subjects for Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery, designed illustrations to Bell's edition of the poets, and practised to some small extent as an etcher and mezzotint-engraver. It is, however, as a painter, in both oil and water- color, of landscapes and rustic subjects that Wheatley is best remembered. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1790, and an academician in the following year. In 1787 he married one of his most popular models, the young Clara Maria Leigh (1768‚Äì1838), who was also an artist. They had a daughter, also Clara Maria, born in 1788. After Wheatley died, his widow married the Irish actor Alexander Pope, and as Mrs Pope she was known as a painter of flowers and portraits.Mary Webster, \\"Pope, Clara Maria (bap. 1767, d. 1838)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 21 March 2015 Selected gallery File:Arthur Phillip.jpg Arthur Phillip File:Francis Wheatley - The Salmon Leap, Leixlip - Google Art Project.jpgThe Salmon Leap, Leixlip File:Francis Wheatley - Portrait of a Sportsman with His Son - Google Art Project.jpgPortrait of a Sportsman with His Son File:Francis Wheatley - Captain Stevens - Google Art Project.jpgCaptain Stevens File:Return from shooting.jpgDuke of Newcastle seated on his horse next to his friend Colonel Litchfield, along with his gamekeeper, Mansell, and four Clumber Spaniels.

Located on the Left Bank of the Estuary of Bilbao, the city is part of Greater Bilbao with a population at 100,881;.Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Madrid. Barakaldo has an industrial river-port heritage and has undergone significant redevelopment with new commercial and residential areas replacing the once active industrial zones.  History  Kadagua between Barakaldo and Bilbaoleft The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica original entry on the town stated: Iron mining formed a large part of Barakaldo's industry, making it the endpoint of a mining railway. The steel industry, led by Altos Hornos de Vizcaya, had an important presence during the 20th century, until the industrial recession hit the region's economy in the 1980s. A-8 motorway In recent decades, the industrial zones surrounding Barakaldo have become less prominent, which can be owed to the shuttering of large companies such as Babcock & Wilcox. Although several factories remain, areas that were once industrial have been redeveloped into residential properties such as malls and parks. A large exhibition centre. the Bilbao Exhibition Centre has recently been built on the outskirts of the town. Transport Metro stationleft Barakaldo is connected to the rest of the Greater Bilbao metropolitan area by Line 2 of the Metro Bilbao. Four stations are in the city: Gurutzeta/Cruces, Ansio, Barakaldo and Bagatza). The Cercan√≠as Bilbao train line has two stations in Barakaldo (Lutxana and Desertu-Barakaldo). BizkaiBus company provides a bus service, with connections to the rest of Biscay. Locally, an urban bus system named Kbus operates with two lines. A tram line has been proposed to connect local districts. The main motorway is the A-8 motorway, which also goes between Bilbao. It serves as the main road link between Greater Bilbao and the rest of Spain. A boat ferry service connects Barakaldo to the other side of the Estuary of Bilbao in Erandio. Barakaldo is located from Bilbao Airport.  Demographics  Population peaked in the 1990s to over 100,300. The decline of local industry decreased the population, though, and in 2002, 95,000 people lived in Barakaldo. However, a recent increase has sent the population to 100,502 residents.  Tourism  Plaza de Cruces - Gurutzeta, as seen from the Hospital. Tourists visit sites in Barakaldo such as the Botanic Garden, the Bilbao Exhibition Centre, the medieval Bridge of Castrexana, and some of the city's street sculptures.

The school is located near Georgia 400 Exit 7B Roswell/Holcomb Bridge Road. It neighbors Fellowship Christian School and Roswell High School. The multi-level curriculum provides Advanced Placement, Honors, Advanced, and Academic classes to fit the needs of each student. The curriculum grew over the first four years to over 130 courses, including 20 Advanced Placement offerings. The fine arts program, which began with study in visual art, dance and vocal music, expanded to include a comprehensive drama program and 65-piece symphonic band. Meet Me in St. Louis was the first musical performed by the Blessed Trinity Theatrical Alliance, staged in April 2004. History The growth in the Catholic population in metro Atlanta, during the 1990s, caused the demand for quality Catholic education to increase. In response to this demand, Archbishop John Francis Donoghue established Catholic Construction Services, Inc. (CCSI) in the fall of 1997, to facilitate the construction of additional Catholic schools. On January 29, 1999, Archbishop Donoghue broke ground onto a new archdiocesan high school, Blessed Trinity. Construction was briefly halted by the discovery of a shallow grave of Confederate soldiers from the Civil War, but was ultimately resumed and completed in 2000. The construction of the school was overseen by Project Manager Allen Kronenberger of CCSI, who commissioned Hussey, Gay, Bell and DeYoung International, Inc. of Savannah as architects for the project. Blessed Trinity opened in August 2000 with a total enrollment of 219 students; 164 freshmen and 55 sophomores. The school's reputation led to its rapid growth, with enrollment increasing to 465 by the second year, 680 in the third, 840 in the fourth, and 875 in the fifth. The school's first graduation occurred on May 24, 2003. In 2014 Blessed Trinity was recognized with a blue ribbon award given to schools with overall academic excellence. Athletics The athletic program kept pace with the school's growth, and by the fourth year fielded 19 varsity teams, which was expanded to 22 in 2004-2005 with the addition of competition cheerleading and boys' and girls' lacrosse. Blessed Trinity has risen in the ranks of the state's athletic programs since beginning a varsity athletic program in 2002. BT won the 2004 and 2009 Directors Cup for class AA for having the top athletic program in AA. The school's first state Championship was won by the girls' golf team in May 2003, and the first state championship won by a boys' team was cross country in October 2003.

It was first established as the Police MRT Unit (PMU) in 2005 as a component unit of the Special Operations Command in response to the need for greater security in public transport operations in Singapore influenced by security concerns at the time. On 15 August 2009, the unit was upgraded into a separate specialist division and took its present name. History In April 2005, during the annual Police Workplan seminar of the Singapore Police Force in April 2005, Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng announced plans to set up a specialised unit. The unit was called the Police MRT Unit (Abbreviation: PMU; ; ) and was part of the Special Operations Command. Officers began operational patrols on the Mass Rapid Transit network from 15 August 2005. Plans to enlarge the PMU into an independent unit within the SPF was announced in 2008. The transition was completed on 15 August 2009 when the unit was upgraded took its present name, reflecting its expanded role to police the entire public transportation network in Singapore. It shifted from its base at Queensway Base to the former Geylang Police Division headquarters building at the end of 2009. It is planned to have two more bases set up due to the expansion of the railway lines in Singapore, the bases will be at Woodlands by 2018 in the new division and in Outram Park by 2020 Manpower and equipment left TransCom draws its manpower from the regular as well as the conscript full-time national servicemen (NSF) resources, with the build of officers amongst the selection criteria. Taller and well-built officers are chosen to project a tougher presence. Officers are trained to conduct policing work in confined and crowded spaces, and are familiarised with the MRT system's operations. In 2007, the unit began to include Volunteer Special Constabulary officers in its ranks. Each TransCom officer is armed with a revolver, T-baton, set of handcuffs and portable radio. Regulars, as well as selected NSFs, are trained in the use of the Taser, as a less-than-lethal option to diffuse situations where lethal force would not be deemed necessary. Officers are dressed in dark blue tactical uniforms similar to those worn by Police Tactical Unit officers. Officers initially wore blue-coloured berets, but were given light grey- coloured berets on 30 December 2009, with the dual purpose of signifying their distinction as an independent department and increasing visibility during operations. Operations TransCom officers currently operate in pairs or larger groups in and around stations and trains on the MRT network. These patrols, which may include the inspection and searching of suspicious packages and persons, are deliberately kept random to retain an element of surprise for greater operational effectiveness. Initially deployed only on the MRT system, TransCom Officers now have their area of operations extended to the bus interchanges and terminals, which were previously patrolled by Neighbourhood Police Centre officers.

The town is about 60 kilometres northwest of the Indian Ocean port of East London. King William‚Äôs Town is the second most populous city in the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality, with a population near 100,000 inhabitants. King, as the town is locally called, stands 389 m above the sea at the foot of the Amathole Mountains and in the midst of a densely populated agricultural district. The town has one of the oldest post offices in the country developed by missionaries led by Brownlee.  History  The area was for thousands of years roamed by Bushman bands, and was then used as grazing by the nomadic Khoikhoi, who called the Buffalo River by Qonce. Xhosa people first settled there in the mid- to late 17th century. The town was founded by Sir Benjamin d‚ÄôUrban in May 1835 during the Xhosa War of that year, the town stands on the site of the kraal of the minor chief Dyani Tyatyu and is named after William IV. It was abandoned in December 1836, but was reoccupied in 1846 and was the capital of British Kaffraria from its creation in 1847 to its incorporation in 1865 with the Cape Colony. Uniquely in the Cape Colony, its local government was styled a borough, rather than a municipality. Many of the colonists in the neighbouring districts are descendants of members of the British German Legion disbanded after the Crimean War and provided with homes in Cape Colony; hence such names as Berlin, Braunschweig, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Potsdam and Stutterheim given to settlements in this part of the country. King William‚Äôs Town was originally declared the provincial capital of the surrounding Adelaide District in the 1830s. On 5 May 1877, the Cape Government of Prime Minister John Molteno opened the first railway, connecting the town to East London on the coast and to the Xhosa lands inland and further east.Burman, Jose (1984), Early Railways at the Cape. Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, p.83. With its direct railway communication, the town became an important entrep√¥t for trade with the Xhosa people throughout Kaffraria. The area's economy depended on cattle and sheep ranching, and the town itself has a large industrial base producing textiles, soap, candles, sweets, cartons and clothing. In recent years, its proximity to the new provincial capital city of Bhisho has brought much development to the area since the end of apartheid in 1994. The provincial government recently announced that they plan to rename the town with a traditional African name, as the current name bears colonial connotations. The town is also home to Huberta, one of the farthest-travelling hippopotami in South Africa. It is preserved in the Amathole Museum in the King Williams Town CBD.

Characters and celebrity guest appearances The show had a quite few minor characters, such as the skeleton puppet Boney Bonerton, voiced by show co-producer Jack Pendarvis. Boney Bonerton would host mini talk shows or game shows, and there would be commercial parodies advertising Boney Bonerton merchandise (i.e. The Boney Bonerton video game or the \\"Boney Bonerton Just Sings\\" CD). Also members of the band The Mekons were regulars on the show, Sally Timms played the character Cowboy Sally (from \\"Wild West Yorkshire\\"), and Jon Langford played the Olde Salty Sea Biscuit, a pirate who would be shown floating on a canoe in a giant bathroom sink. Other celebrity guest appearances included Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, and Ed Lover and Doctor Dr√© from Yo! MTV Raps. Variations and film specials Some episodes ran under various titles (such as \\"Rudy and Gogo 2000\\", \\"Rudy y Gogo\\", and \\"Taterhole\\") and TNT also used Rudy and Gogo as hosts for various cult classic film marathon specials, such as \\"Rudy and Gogo's Thanksgiving Leftover Special\\" and \\"Rudy and Gogo's Funtime Movie Parade\\". The \\"Rudy and Gogo's New Year's Eve Flaming Cheese Ball\\" special for New Year's Eve 1995 showed the films The Blob, Queen of Outer Space, House on Haunted Hill, and Thunderbirds Are Go and featured Gogo's surprise announcement for the 1996 US presidential election, as well the anti-climactic dropping of the giant cheese ball at midnight. The \\"Gogo Para Presidente\\" campaign jingle became a popular segment of the show. End of the series and fan followings In 1996, the Minneapolis rock trio John Updyke's Lick Pussy (later renamed J.U.L.P) recorded a version of \\"Gogo Para Presidente\\" for a 7\\" vinyl b-side for the Earmark Records label. In 1997 they debuted a music video, directed by Mike \\"Suade\\" Newell, at First Avenue Nightclub. This low budget, sepia-toned short featured the band putting up \\"snipe\\" posters that read \\"Vote Goat\\" on walls and phone poles. It was later included on Newell's DVD entitled \\"Michael C. Newell - History: 1991-2004\\". The program was also a favorite in college dorms and had a particularly devoted following in New York University‚Äôs Hayden Hall. During the 1995-96 school year, several freshmen students wrote to the program and were rewarded by having their names appear on screen as friends of the show. The series ended its run in August 1997. In fall 1998, TNT stopped showing cartoons altogether and the network started to change its image.

His business was centered in Little Italy, Manhattan, where he ran large extortion operations and committed other crimes including robberies, loan-sharking, and murder. By the start of the 20th century, Lupo merged his crew with others in the South Bronx and East Harlem to form the Morello crime family, which became the leading Mafia family in New York City. Suspected of at least 60 murders, he was not caught by authorities until 1910, when the Secret Service arrested him for running a large scale counterfeiting ring in the Catskills. He was paroled after serving 10 years of a 30-year sentence. A few years later, he was forced into retirement by the emerging National Crime Syndicate led by Lucky Luciano. Early life Ignazio Lupo was born in Palermo, Sicily, to parents Rocco Lupo and Onofria Saietta. He has sometimes been referred to, using his mother's maiden name, as Ignazio Saietta, but his actual surname was Lupo.Critchley, p. 254., note 77 From age 10, he worked in a dry goods store in Palermo. In October 1898, he shot and killed a business rival named Salvatore Morello, according to Lupo in self- defense after Morello attacked him with a dagger during an argument in Lupo's store. Lupo went into hiding after the killing and on the advice of his parents, eventually fled Sicily to escape prosecution. After stops in Liverpool, Montreal, and Buffalo, he arrived in New York in 1898. On March 14, 1899, Lupo was convicted in absentia of 'willful and deliberate murder', reportedly due to the testimony of the clerks who worked in his store. Lupo would never serve out the Sicilian sentence, though he would one day return to Sicily. Upon settling in New York City, Lupo opened a store at East 72nd Street in Manhattan with his cousin Saitta, but moved his business to Brooklyn after a disagreement. In 1901, he moved his business back to Manhattan and opened a small import store at 9 Prince Street, while also running a saloon across the street at 8 Prince Street. Lupo's father, Rocco, joined him in New York City in 1902 and together they opened a retail grocery store on 39th Street between 9th and 10th avenues. Around this time, Lupo began preying on his fellow Italian immigrants, using the extortion tactics of the Black Hand. Morello crime family In 1902, Giuseppe Morello acquired a saloon at 8 Prince Street, at the rear of the premises where Lupo was running his saloon.Critchley, pp. 37-40. Morello had immigrated to the United States from Sicily in the 1890s and had been joined by his three half brothers Vincenzo Terranova, Ciro Terranova and Nicholas Morello.Critchley, pp. 51-54. Lupo became closely associated with the Morello-Terranova faction and eventually married into their immediate family when he wed Salvatrice Terranova on December 23, 1903. He maintained his leadership over his Little Italy-based interests, but in the early 1900s Lupo merged his Mafia faction with the Morello-Terranova faction, which basically formed what became known as the Morello crime family, then the leading Mafia family in New York City. Lupo kept his base of operations in Little Italy, but shared the overall leadership of the crime family with Giuseppe Morello from his base in East Harlem, while various members of their group including Morello's half brothers led the affiliated groups and ran the rackets with soldiers like Giuseppe Fanaro, Giuseppe \\"Joe\\" Catania Sr., Charles Ubriaco and Tommaso \\"The Ox\\" Petto, a top enforcer and killer within the crime family. Lupo demanded absolute obedience from the members of his crew‚Äîfor example, he killed one of his relatives just because he merely suspected he was a traitor. His reputation became so fearsome that it was common for Italian immigrants to cross themselves at the mention of his name. Crimes committed and jail time Lupo was suspected of at least 60 murders, and may have killed many more. He was a suspect in the killing on July 22, 1902, of Giuseppe \\"Joe the Grocer\\" Catania.gang Rule Catania was suspected of openly talking about a counterfeit operation which he was involved in with Lupo to his neighbors and friends, Catania also testified against several men in Palmero, which resulted in their 20-year prison terms; Catania was stabbed to death and left inside a potato sack on the shore of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Lupo was also suspected of the April 14, 1903, barrel murder of Madonia Benedetto. However, he was not caught until 1910, when the Secret Service arrested him for running a large scale counterfeiting ring in the Catskills. He was sentenced to 30 years and imprisoned in Atlanta Prison,Inmate 2883 at the US National Archive index of inmates of Atlanta prison but was granted parole on June 30, 1920. While serving out the conditions of parole, Lupo wanted to take a trip to Italy, however, the Parole Act forbade him from leaving the country. In 1922, President Warren Harding freed Lupo from the constraints of his parole by granting a conditional commutation of sentence. The Annual Report of the Attorney General for 1922 mentioned Lupo's desire to return to Italy but also noted that his codefendant, Giuseppe Morello, had received a commutation after just eight years of imprisonment. The former Chief of the Selective Service considered the relative guilt of the two men to be, roughly, the same and thus recommended a commutation for Lupo.Annual Report of the U.S. Attorney General, 1922, p. 400.Capeci, Jerry. The complete idiot's guide to the Mafia \\"The Mafia's Commission\\" (pp. 31‚Äì46) Harding did, however, attach a condition to the commutation, requiring Lupo to remain \\"law-abiding\\" and \\"not connected with any unlawful undertaking during the period of the sentence\\". The President himself would be the sole judge of whether the \\"condition\\" was ever violated and, if it ever was, he could declare the commutation null and void. In such circumstance, the President would order Lupo arrested and returned to prison to serve out the remainder of the sentence.P.S. Ruckman, Jr., \\"The Mafia, the Murder Stable and Presidential Mercy\\", May 6, 2013, Pardon Power. Sometime in the early 1930s, the leaders of the emerging National Crime Syndicate called Lupo in for a meeting and forced him to give up nearly all of his rackets, except for a small Italian lottery in Brooklyn. Lupo relied almost entirely on violence and terror. The Syndicate preferred to use bribery first, and felt Lupo's tactics generated too much heat. On his own, Lupo formed a protection racket involving bakers. In 1936, New York Governor Herbert Lehman petitioned President Franklin D. Roosevelt to have Lupo returned to prison for massive racketeering. He was returned to Atlanta Prison to serve a few years on his original counterfeiting sentence. Death After his release, he returned to Brooklyn, where he died more or less unnoticed in 1947. Lupo and the four Morello-Terranova brothers are interred in Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York, not far from Joe Petrosino, who investigated them, or other Morello crime family members.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1914 to 1915, as a member of the Liberal Party. Early life Molloy was born in Shelley, Manitoba. His father, John Molloy, was a Dominion land surveyor, and was involved in early construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The elder Molloy sought election to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1879 federal election, but lost to Joseph Royal of the Conservative Party in the riding of Provencher. Thomas Molloy was educated at public school in Emerson, and at normal school in Winnipeg. He worked as a contractor. He was reeve of the Rural Municipality of Ste. Anne from 1919 to 1921. Political career Thomas Molloy was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, defeating Conservative incumbent Albert Prefontaine by seven votes in the Carillon constituency. The Conservatives won the election, and Molloy sat with his party in opposition. In 1915, the Conservative government of Rodmond Roblin was forced to resign from office amid a corruption scandal. A new election was called, in which the Liberals won a landslide majority. Molloy, however, lost his seat to Prefontaine by twenty-four votes. His defeat was primarily due to the Liberal Party's unpopularity among some francophone voters, who opposed the party's plans to end funding for denominational education. Molloy ran for the Canadian House of Commons in the federal election of 1921 as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada, and lost to Progressive candidate Robert Alexander Hoey by 1,397 votes in the riding of Springfield. He also attempted to return to the provincial legislature in the 1927, but lost to Prefontaine by 1,146 votes. Prefontaine was by this time a member of the Progressive Party of Manitoba. Molloy made a further bid for elected office in the 1935 federal election, running as a candidate of Henry Herbert Stevens's Reconstruction Party in the riding of St. Boniface. He finished last in a field of five candidates with only 438 votes. Personal life and death In 1911, Molloy married Marie, the daughter of Joseph Dubuc. His brothers John Patrick and William also served in the Manitoba assembly. He died at home in Montreal at the age of 69.

He was a member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly for the electorate of Perth from 1892 until 1894, and thereafter became a perennial candidate, unsuccessfully standing for parliament 14 times. He also served two terms as the Mayor of Perth, from 1908 to 1909 and from 1911 to 1912. Molloy also made a significant contribution to the cultural life of Perth, building numerous hotels and the first two theatres in the city, most notably His Majesty's Theatre, which is still open today. Biography Molloy was born in Toronto, Upper Canada, to John Molloy, a soldier who had served with the Royal Welch Fusiliers in the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny of 1857, and Jane n√©e Curtis. In 1862, they migrated to Western Australia, where John Molloy served as a Pensioner Guard supervising convicts who had been transported from the United Kingdom. Thomas Molloy, meanwhile, attended Christian Brothers College, Perth, and left school at the age of 13 to work at a printing office. He then worked in the cooperative movement with J.T. Reilly, and became manager of the city cooperative store at the corner of Barrack and Murray Streets. By 1870, his successes enabled him to buy the entire block between Murray and Wellington for ¬£900. On 18 February 1873, he married Amelia Littlejohn, with whom he had two daughters and one son. They moved to South Australia, where he worked as a merchant, but returned to Perth in 1875 where he became a successful baker, not only owning his Goderich Street shop but also 10 two-roomed cottages for his workers. Returning to printing, he worked on the Daily News from 1881, and then from 1884 became commercial manager for The West Australian. He became involved in buying and selling real estate in the central and western parts of the city, and by the 1890s with the onset of the gold rush and the resulting flow of capital into Western Australia, this had proved profitable enough an enterprise that he was of independent means and had become one of the largest landowners in Perth. His wife died on 21 April 1888, and he subsequently married Mary Reaney McHale on 23 January 1889, with whom he had two daughters. =Political life= In 1884, Molloy was elected to the Perth City Council, where he represented the Central and West wards until 1906. In December 1891, Dr Edward Scott resigned from the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of Perth, and Molloy nominated for the resulting by-election which he won against mayor Edward Keane, and was duly appointed to the vacancy on 13 January 1892. In this, he had been supported by the infant Trades and Labor Council, who were advocating electoral reform, payment of Members of Parliament, prohibition of Asian immigration and introduction of an arbitration court. Being Roman Catholic and not part of the landed classes which dominated the Parliament of that time, he proved to be somewhat populist in character, advocating universal suffrage and public ownership of power and utilities. However, he became embroiled in a controversy regarding education which split the labour movement along sectarian lines. In 1892, the Forrest government had overseen the creation of a Department of Education under ministerial control, while maintaining state aid to private schools. A National Education League led by prominent Congregationalist George Randell, led the cause against this, arguing that it was an obstacle to the creation of an efficient education system. In response, the Catholic Vicar General, Father Anselm Bourke, established the Education Defence League with the assistance of Molloy and fellow Catholic MLAs Timothy Quinlan and Alfred Canning. The issue became a major one in the 1894 election amongst the voting public, with all three MLAs losing their seats‚ÄîMolloy being defeated by Randell himself. After this loss, Molloy unsuccessfully contested the Metropolitan Province seat in the Western Australian Legislative Council in 1894, when the body became fully elective. He then attempted to re-enter Parliament on a further twelve occasions under a variety of party labels or as an independent, and then as a Nationalist Party candidate from 1917 onwards. His last effort was at a by-election for the Metropolitan Province in 1932. He continued through this period as a Perth City councillor, serving as mayor of Perth in 1908‚Äì09 and 1911‚Äì12. He was known as something of a radical, espousing similar causes to those he had supported previously, with a notable achievement during his time as mayor being the ending of Perth Gas Company's monopoly on power and lighting in 1912. He also advocated public ownership of Perth's tramways, but was outnumbered by other councillors‚Äîtransport remained in private ownership until the advent of the Metropolitan Transport Trust in 1956. He also opposed admission charges to enter public space and sporting events on the Esplanade, and supported the construction of free public baths. After 1912, he tried repeatedly to become mayor again with poor results, being labelled \\"too stubborn and disputatious to work with\\". =Civic and cultural life= Molloy was made a Justice of the Peace in 1895, and was appointed in 1897 to the Board of Trustees for the Karrakatta Cemetery. He became chairman of the Board in 1924 and served in that role until 26 October 1937. He was also instrumental in attracting finance and commissioning some of Perth's early cultural buildings. Up until the 1890s, Perth had no theatres, and actors performed in either the Perth Town Hall or in St George's Hall, described by The West Australian in 1891 as a place \\"where there is much that is unsuitable\\" and \\"the most significant proof of the old-time backwardness and poverty of Western Australia\\".The West Australian, 27 August 1891, p.4. At the time Western Australia had 53,177 people‚Äîa figure that was to double within the next five years. On 20 September 1893, Molloy purchased Perth Lot F3 on the south side of what is now Hay Street Mall with the assistance of Alexander Forrest, the then Mayor of Perth, and obtained a publican's licence a week later. In 1894, the Hotel Metropole was constructed on the site, and in February 1895, he announced plans for a 1,000-seat theatre to be built on land adjoining the hotel. The foundation stone was laid by Mrs A. Forrest on 8 May 1895, and the Theatre Royal opened on 19 April 1897. While its initial success was mixed, due mainly to the changing economic and demographic characteristics of Perth, by the 1930s it had become the most popular picture theatre in Perth. It eventually closed in 1977. By 1901, Perth had become a place of optimism and confidence fuelled by the gold rush. In 1902, after the ascension of King Edward VII to the English throne, Molloy announced plans for a new theatre at Hay and King Streets, to be known as His Majesty's Theatre. It was completed at a cost of ‚Ç§46,000 by architect William Wolf and builder Frederick Liebe, and for many years boasted the largest stage in Australia. The Heritage Council of Western Australia, which listed the building in 1999, described it as having \\"the most lavish and well-executed ornamentation of any Federation Free Classical theatre building in Australia\\". Molloy went on to build other hotels, such as the Australia Hotel in Perth, the North Beach Hotel, the Brighton Hotel in Scarborough and the Oceanic (later Mosman Park) Hotel. =Later life= His second wife Mary died on 7 February 1925. He was created a papal knight commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great in 1931‚Äîgiven his anxiousness to become a knight, he went by the title of Sir from this point.

He also studied at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.Larry LaRocco Washington Post Congress votes database LaRocco and his wife Chris have two children and two grandchildren. Military service LaRocco joined the U.S. Army and was commissioned on August 15, 1969; he was eventually promoted to captain and served in military intelligence at the Intelligence Data Handling Systems (IDHS) at 7th Army Headquarters in Heidelberg, Germany towards the end of his army career. On May 24, 1972, the Baader-Meinhof Gang, the precursor of the Red Army Faction, exploded a car bomb outside of Campbell Barracks which killed three of LaRocco's fellow soldiers.

In the 1982 elections, LaRocco was the Democratic nominee for Idaho's 1st congressional district; he lost to incumbent Larry Craig, but received 46.5 percent of the vote on his first try for public office. LaRocco also gained notice that year for taking jobs for one week in each of the district's 19 counties. He variously worked on a garbage truck, picked apples, waited on tables, worked in a nursing home and on a logging road crew, fed Coho smolt and processed cheese, among other things.

The molecule consists of a cyclopentane ring fused with 5 benzene rings, so another name for it is [5]circulene. It is of scientific interest because it is a geodesic polyarene and can be considered a fragment of buckminsterfullerene. Due to this connection and also its bowl shape, corannulene is also known as a buckybowl. Corannulene exhibits a bowl-to-bowl inversion with an inversion barrier of 10.2 kcal/mol (42.7 kJ/mol) at ‚àí64 ¬∞C. Synthesis Several synthetic routes exist to corannulene. Flash vacuum pyrolysis techniques generally have lower chemical yields than solution- chemistry syntheses, but offer routes to more derivatives. Corannulane was first isolated in 1966 by multistep organic synthesis. In 1971, the synthesis and properties of corannulane were reported. A flash vacuum pyrolysis method followed in 1991. One synthesis based on solution chemistry consists of a nucleophilic displacement-elimination reaction of an octabromide with potassium hydroxide: :Corannulene synthesis Sygula 2000 The bromine substituents are removed with an excess of n-butyllithium. A kilogram scale synthesis of corannulene has been achieved. Much effort is directed at functionalization of the corannulene ring with novel functional groups such as ethynyl groups, ether groups, thioether groups, platinum functional groups, aryl groups, phenalenyl fused and indeno extensions. and ferrocene groups. Aromaticity The observed aromaticity for this compound is explained with a so-called annulene-within-an-annulene model. According to this model corannulene is made up of an aromatic 6 electron cyclopentadienyl anion surrounded by an aromatic 14 electron annulenyl cation. This model was suggested by Barth and Lawton in the first synthesis of corannulene in 1966. They also suggested the trivial name 'corannulene', which is derived from the annulene-within-an-annulene model: core + annulene. :annulene-within-an- annulene model However, later theoretical calculations have disputed the validity of this approximation. Reactions = Reduction = Corannulene can be reduced up to a tetraanion in a series of one-electron reductions. This has been performed with alkali metals, electrochemically and with bases. The corannulene dianion is antiaromatic and tetraanion is again aromatic. With lithium as reducing agent two tetraanions form a supramolecular dimer with two bowls stacked into each other with 4 lithium ions in between and 2 pairs above and below the stack. This self-assembly motif was applied in the organization of fullerenes. Penta-substituted fullerenes (with methyl or phenyl groups) charged with five electrons form supramolecular dimers with a complementary corannulene tetraanion bowl, 'stitched' by interstitial lithium cations. In a related system 5 lithium ions are sandwiched between two corannulene bowls In one cyclopenta[bc]corannulene a concave - concave aggregate is observed by NMR spectroscopy with 2 C‚ÄìLi‚ÄìC bonds connecting the tetraanions. :Cyclopenta[bc]corannulene Metals tend to bind to the convex face of the annulene. Concave binding has been reported for a cesium / crown ether system = Oxidation= UV 193-nm photoionization effectively removes a œÄ-electron from the twofold degenerate E1-HOMO located in the aromatic network of electrons yielding a corannulene radical cation. Owing to the degeneracy in the HOMO orbital, the corannulene radical cation is unstable in its original C5v molecular arrangement, and therefore, subject to Jahn-Teller (JT) vibronic distortion. Using electrospray ionization, a protonated corannulene cation has been produced in which the protonation site was observed to be on a peripheral sp2-carbon atom. =Reaction with electrophiles= Corannulene can react with electrophiles to form a corannulene carbocation. Reaction with chloromethane and aluminium chloride results in the formation of an AlCl4‚àí salt with a methyl group situated at the center with the cationic center at the rim. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the new carbon-carbon bond is elongated (157 pm) Bicorannulenyl Bicorannulenyl is the product of dehydrogenative coupling of corannulene. With the formula C20H9-C20H9, it consists of two corannulene units connected through a single C-C bond. The molecule's stereochemistry consists of two chiral elements: the asymmetry of a singly substituted corannulenyl, and the helical twist about the central bond. In the neutral state, bicorannulenyl exists as 12 conformers, which intercovert through multiple bowl-inversions and bond-rotations. When bicorannulenyl is reduced to a dianion with potassium metal, the central bond assumes significant double-bond character. This change is attributed to the orbital structure, which has a LUMO orbital localized on the central bond. When bicorannulenyl is reduced to an octaanion with lithium metal, it self- assembles into supramolecular oligomers. This motif illustrates \\"charged polyarene stacking\\". Research The buckycatcherThe corannulene group is used in host‚Äìguest chemistry with interactions based on pi stacking, notably with fullerenes (the buckycatcher) but also with nitrobenzene Alkyl- substituted corannulenes form a thermotropic hexagonal columnar liquid crystalline mesophase. Corannulene has also been used as the core group in a dendrimer. Like other PAHs, corannulene ligates metals. Corannulenes with ethynyl groups are investigated for their potential use as blue emitters.

The dominant historical use of zein was in the textile fibers market where it was produced under the name \\"Vicara\\". With the development of synthetic alternatives, the use of zein in this market eventually disappeared. By using electrospinning, zein fibers have again been produced in the lab, where additional research will be performed to re-enter the fiber market.Miyoshi, T., Toyohara, H., Minematsu, H. \\"Preparation of ultrafine fibrous zein membranes via electrospinning\\", Polymer International Vol. 54, no. 8, 2005.Selling, G., Biswas, A., Patel, A., Walls, D., Dunlap, C., Wei, Y. \\"Impact of Solvent on Electrospinning of Zein and Analysis of Resulting Fibers\\", Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics Vol. 208, no. 9, 2007. It can be used as a water and grease coating for paperboards and allows recyclability. Zein's properties make it valuable in processed foods and pharmaceuticals, in competition with insect shellac. It is now used as a coating for candy, nuts, fruit, pills, and other encapsulated foods and drugs. In the United States, it may be labeled as \\"confectioner's glaze\\" (which may also refer to shellac-based glazes) and used as a coating on bakery products or as \\"vegetable protein.\\" It is classified as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For pharmaceutical coating, zein is preferred over food shellac, since it is all natural and requires less testing per the USP monographs. Zein can be further processed into resins and other bioplastic polymers, which can be extruded or rolled into a variety of plastic products.Lee, Richard \\"Multiple-use Corn zein-based Biodegradable Resins, Sheets, and Films are an attractive alternative to plastic\\", University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.Lawton Jr., J.W. \\"Plasticizers for Zein:their Effect on Tensile Properties and Water Absorption of Zein Films\\" January 12, 2004, Cereal Chemistry. With increasing environmental concerns about synthetic coatings (such as PFOA) and the current higher prices of hydrocarbon-based petrochemicals, there is increased focus on zein as a raw material for a variety of nontoxic and renewable polymer applications, particularly in the paper industry.Jabar, Anthony Jr; Bilodeau, Michael A.; Neivandt, David J.; Spender, Jonathan \\"Barrier Compositions and Articles Produced with the Compositions\\", December 29, 2005, United States Patent (pending)Parris, Nicholas; Sykes, Marguerite; Dickey, Leland C.; Wiles, Jack L.; Urbanik, Thomas J.; Cooke, Peter H. \\"Recyclable zein-coated kraft paper\\", Progress in paper recycling Vol. 11, no. 3, May 2002. Other reasons for a renewed interest in zein include concern about the landfill costs of plastics, and consumer interest in natural substances. There are also a number of potential new food industry applications. Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at William Wrigley Jr. Company have recently been studying the possibility of using zein to replace some of the gum base in chewing gum.McGowan B.A., Padua G.W., and Lee S-Y. \\"Formulation of Corn Zein Chewing Gum and Evaluation of Sensory Properties by the Time-Intensity Method\\", September, 2005, Journal of Food Science.

They are unusually rich in glutamine, proline, alanine, and leucine residues and their sequences show a series of tandem repeats presumed to be the result of multiple intragenic duplication. In Zea mays (Maize), the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are encoded by a large multigene family and are the major seed storage proteins accounting for 70% of the total zein fraction. Structurally the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are composed of nine adjacent, topologically antiparallel helices clustered within a distorted cylinder. The 22 kDa alpha-zeins are encoded by 23 genes; twenty- two of the members are found in a roughly tandem array forming a dense gene cluster.

Oskar Vogt (6 April 1870, Husum ‚Äì 30 July 1959, Freiburg im Breisgau) was a German physician and neurologist. He and his wife C√©cile Vogt-Mugnier are known for their extensive cytoarchetectonic studies on the brain. Personal life He was born in Husum, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Vogt studied medicine at Kiel and Jena, obtaining his doctorate from Jena in 1894. The Vogts met in 1897 in Paris, and eventually married in 1899. The Vogts were close to the Krupp family. Friedrich Alfred Krupp financially supported them, and in 1898, Oskar and C√©cile founded a private research institute called the Neurologische Zentralstation (Neurological Center) in Berlin, which was formally associated with the Physiological Institute of the Charit√© as the Neurobiological Laboratory of the Berlin University in 1902. This institute served as the basis for the 1914 formation of the Kaiser Institut f√ºr Hirnforschung (Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research), of which Oskar was a director. There, he had students from many countries who went on to prominent careers including Jerzy Rose (mentor of Michael Merzenich), Valentino Braitenberg (mentor of Christof Koch), Korbinian Brodmann, Rafael Lorente de N√≥ and Harald Brockhaus. This institute gave rise to the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in 1945.Helga Satzinger ‚Äì Femininity and Science: The Brain Researcher C√©cile Vogt (1875-1962) . Translation of: Weiblichkeit und Wissenschaft. In: Bleker, Johanna (ed.): Der Eintritt der Frauen in die Gelehrtenrepublik. Husum, 1998, 75-93. As a clinician, Vogt used hypnotism (Stuckrade-Barre and Danek 2004) until 1903 and wrote papers on the topic. In particular, Vogt had an intense interest for localizing the origins of \\"genius\\" or traits in the brain. =Family= Vogt married the French neurologist C√©cile Vogt-Mugnier. They met in Paris in 1897 while he was there working with Joseph Jules Dejerine and his wife, Augusta Marie Dejerine-Klumke, who collaborated with him. Because of their similar scholarly interests, the Vogts collaborated for a long period, usually with C√©cile as the primary author. The Vogts had two daughters, both accomplished scientists in their own right: * Marthe Vogt (1903‚Äì2003) was a neuropharmacologist who became a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Professor at Cambridge. * Marguerite Vogt (1913‚Äì2007) started as a developmental geneticist working in Drosophila, then moved to the US in 1950. She developed methods to culture poliovirus with Renato Dulbecco. She was a faculty member at The Salk Institute for Biological Studies where she worked on viral transformation and cellular immortalization of cancer cells. =Politics= Vogt was a socialist, involved with the factions led by Mme Fessard who knew him personally, and with the guesdist element of the French socialist party (Jules Guesde was at the far left wing of this party). He was never a Communist, although he did interact with the Soviets on a number of occasions. They sent him several researchers, including N. V. Timofeev-Resovskij (whom Solzhenitsyn met in the Gulag). He helped to establish the brain institute in Moscow. Vogt was opposed to the Nazi Party. Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach helped fund a small hospital in Schwarzwald near Neustadt when Vogt was dismissed in 1936 from his position with the Kaiser Wilhelm Brain Research Institute. Institutes and journals Vogt was the editor of the prominent Journal f√ºr Psychologie und Neurologie published in German, French and English which made many of the most important contributions between the two World Wars. This later became The Journal f√ºr Hirnforschung. Lenin's brain Vogt had a longstanding interest in localizing functions in the brain. In 1924, Vogt was one of the neurologists asked to consult on Lenin‚Äôs illness and was given his brain for histological study after Lenin's death. He found that Lenin's brain showed a great number of \\"giant cells\\", which Vogt saw as a sign of superior mental function. \\"The giant cells\\" were cortical pyramidal cells of unusual size. There were also particularities in layer 3. In 1925 Vogt accepted an invitation to Moscow where he was assigned the establishment of an institute for brain research under the auspices of the health ministry in Moscow. In 1945 Lenin's brain was still in the Institute of Berlin. According to claims of two Belgians, L. Van Bogaert and A. Dewulf, the Soviets carried out a military operation specifically to retrieve the brain before the Americans obtained it, and succeeded in doing so. It was, for a time, put on display in the Lenin Mausoleum. The brain is now at Moscow's Institute. Contributions Korbinian Brodmann, C√©cile Vogt-Mugnier, Oskar Vogt, Max Borcherdt, and Max Lewandowsky. The contributions of the Vogts are of the first order as their work applies to several parts of the brain and had a considerable influence on international neurological sciences. =Cortex= An interest in the correlation between anatomy and psychology drew the Vogts to study the cortex. The Vogts imposed the distinction between iso- and allocortex. Based on their cytoarchitectonic studies, they promoted a six- layer pattern (there were 5 for Meynert and 7 for Cajal). =Thalamus= Oskar made several presentations of his view of the thalamus in Paris. Oskar and C√©cile further referred to the work of Constantin von Monakow in a series on the anatomy of mammals. This was not a seminal work. The main contribution of the Vogts was La myelocytoarchitecture du thalamus du cercopith√®que from C√©cile alone (1909). The great contribution of C√©cile has been that the partition of the lateral region (lateral mass) should rely on the territories (the spaces occupied) of the main afferents. She distinguished from back to front the lemnical radiation and a particular nucleus, in front of it the cerebellar (prelemniscal) radiation with another nucleus and more anteriorly the \\"lenticular\\" radiation. This system still describes the subdivision of the thalamus (Percheron, 1977, Percheron et al. 1996). Her paper was followed by Die cytoarchitechtonik des Zwishenhirns de Cercothipiteken from Friedmann (1911) traducing in cytoarchitectonic terms, her partition. A paper published in common in 1941 (Thalamus studien I to III), devoted to the human thalamus, represented an important step in partitioning and naming thalamic parts. The anatomy of the thalamus from Hassler (one of their students) was published in 1959, the year of the death of Oskar. It is not known whether the master accepted the excessive partition and unnecessary complication of this work; it was an atlas dedicated to stereotacticans. The paper of 1941 was much simpler. =Basal ganglia= The Vogts greatly contributed to the analysis of what is known today as the basal ganglia system. Their main interest was on the striatum, that after Foix and Nicolesco they proposed (1941) to name so. This was including the caudate nucleus, the putamen and the fundus.

Taking place during the early twentieth century, it follows the collision between a British archeologist's family and a resurrected mummy. The novel ends with the statement, \\"The Adventures of Ramses the Damned Shall Continue\\", and twenty-eight years later, Rice fulfilled this promise with Ramses the Damned: The Passion of Cleopatra, written in collaboration with her son, novelist Christopher Rice. Plot introduction During the Edwardian period in 1914, a wealthy shipping-magnate-turned-archaeologist, Lawrence Stratford, discovers an unusual tomb. The mummy inside, in its left-behind notes, claims to be the famed pharaoh Ramses II, despite the tomb's dating only to the first century B.C. (the historical Ramses II died in 1224 B.C.). Before he can fully investigate this claim, Lawrence unexpectedly falls dead, and those around him fear he was the victim of a curse placed on the tomb. Nonetheless, the mummy and other belongings are shipped off to London, and placed on temporary display in Lawrence's house before they are taken by the British Museum. Lawrence's daughter Julie Stratford is the designated heir to her father's shipping company, as well as the dysfunctional family that surrounds it. Her cousin Henry is an alcoholic and gambling addict who has been draining the family fortune with the aid of his father. Julie is engaged to marry Alex Savarell, a viscount and son of Elliott, the current Earl of Rutherford. Although the marriage is a standard alliance between the wealthy Stratfords and an impoverished family of nobles, Alex truly loves Julie, though she is unable to return these feelings. Into this unstable situation comes the mummy Ramses, who awakes shortly after his sarcophagus is placed in Julie's house. Plot summary Henry murders his uncle Lawrence with a poison found in the mummy's tomb. When Henry tries to poison Julie in the same manner, Ramses comes to life and attempts to kill Henry, but succeeds only in scaring him away. After his awakening, Julie and Ramses are instantly attracted to each other. Ramses quickly adopts a pseudonym, \\"Reginald Ramsey\\", and claims to be an Egyptologist to throw off the accusation made by the frightened Henry that a \\"bloody mummy\\" rose from the crypt to harm him. With superhuman intelligence and the ability to learn quickly, Ramses quickly learns the English language and, with the help of an eager Julie, is given a tour of modern London and new technology that had arisen during the past two thousand years. While Henry's accusations are passed off as the rantings of a drunkard, the elderly and ailing Elliott Savarell suspects that it may be the truth. He trails Ramses and comes to believe that he is who Henry claims him to be. During Ramses's reign as pharaoh, he had learned from a Hittite priestess the formula for an elixir that grants eternal life. The potion not only made him immortal, but also allows his body to regenerate from damage that would kill a normal human, such as multiple bullet wounds. He requires neither food nor drink nor sleep, and only the sun's rays to maintain his life. However, he still craves food and certain other physical pleasures, like sex, smoking, and alcohol. Ramses nurses a deep secret. Prior to the Roman conquest of Egypt, he had served as an immortal advisor to its kings and queens, and the last person to awake him for consultation had been Cleopatra, the last ruler of Egypt. Although he served as Cleopatra's counsel (and encouraged her to romance Julius Caesar in a bid to keep the country independent), he had also fallen in love with her, and had revealed to her the secrets of the elixir. Having fallen in love with Mark Antony in defiance of Ramses's advice, Cleopatra refuses the elixir and chooses suicide upon Antony's death. In his depression, Ramses had given himself the name \\"Ramses the Damned\\", and had Egyptian priests seal him away underground. With Julie's encouragement, Ramses begins to recover. While Henry is convinced that Ramses is an evil monster ready to kill the entire family, Elliott reads Lawrence's notes and chases after Ramses to learn the secret of the elixir of immortality. Eventually, Ramses and Julie decide to visit Egypt one last time so that Ramses can say good-bye to his past. Although Ramses appears to be coming to terms with his past, upon visiting the Cairo Museum, he unexpectedly recognizes an unidentified mummy as being that of Cleopatra. Breaking into the museum later at night simply to see her, he impulsively pours some of the elixir onto the dead body. Cleopatra is revived, but by Ramses not pouring the entire vial of elixir on her, the restoration is incomplete; she is a half- formed monstrosity, awake and conscious yet with parts of her face, hands, and torso still gone. Her incomplete brain restoration leaves her not totally coherent; though Ramses later repairs her body with more of the potion, she appears to be insane and kills a number of people, including Henry. Cleopatra unexpectedly falls in love with Elliot's son Alex though realizes a life with him cannot last because of his mortality and his innocence. Because Ramses would not give her long-ago love Mark Antony the elixir to save his life, Cleopatra holds a passionate hatred for him and seeks to even the score by killing his current love: Julie Stratford. Cleopatra ultimately falters before killing Julie, realizing that the girl should not be punished for Ramses's actions. She also comes to regret the other murders she has committed. In an attempt to escape Ramses, Cleopatra \\"dies\\" when her car is hit by a train and is consumed by a fiery explosion so hot that it \\"could kill even an immortal\\". Ramses later gives the elixir to Julie after she attempts suicide in her grief for her loss of him, and he promises to stay with her for eternity. To thank him for his help in covering up all the unusual events, Ramses also gives the elixir to a dying Elliott, who drinks it after serious consideration of the consequences: dying miserably, or living eternally even when wishing for nothing but oblivion. Cleopatra has secretly survived the crash, and awakens under the care of a British doctor in Sudan. She vows to find Ramses again someday for revenge. Development The Mummy was originally a film script by Rice, who said producers \\"wanted to change everything.\\" She explained, \\"I think I went off to create that book just to spite them, I was so furious.\\" Major themes Like the vampires of Rice's Vampire Chronicles, those who take the elixir become immortal, inhumanly strong, and unable to die from normal means. These individuals could even be said to be \\"reverse vampires\\" since they derive their strength from the sun, and cannot live without it. Unlike vampires, they are able to eat, drink and function as normal humans. However, this immortality comes with a strange price. Those who drink the potion are constantly driven to sate their senses. They constantly crave food and drink, although they need neither to survive. They have an extremely heightened libido. Moreover, their bodies continually blunt drugs that give humans pleasure. For example, Ramses constantly drinks and smokes because the \\"buzz\\" the alcohol or nicotine would normally give him fades after a few moments. But perhaps most importantly, the elixir causes any organic substance to become invulnerable and self-sustaining. Having once tested it upon livestock and crops in his own time, he had been horrified to find that such things transformed by the elixir cannot be digested and continually regenerate even inside the intestines, with bloody and gruesome results. And once this elixir is used, it cannot be undone and should it be poured into a fire, it would become dust that could then be swept by rain into the rivers or the oceans, creating immortal fish and sea creatures, or watering plants to become invulnerable. Therefore, the elixir, once brewed, cannot be disposed of by any means other than deliberate consumption. For this reason, the elixir's formula is strictly hidden by Ramses, though the ingredients are common and easily obtained. His feud with Cleopatra before the events of the novel had begun when he refused to create an \\"immortal army\\" for Mark Antony's use. As with many Rice novels, sexuality tends to be fluid. Both Elliott and Lawrence are described as bisexual‚Äîwhen younger, they were lovers, but both eventually married and had children. In the past, Henry had an affair with Elliott as well, but his only reason may have been a failed blackmail attempt, as at the time of the novel, Henry has at least two mistresses. As always, Rice employs considerable irony. For example, after his death, Henry's corpse ends up in a \\"mummy factory\\" (during the Egyptian craze of the early 1900s, natives often took modern corpses and made them into mummies for sale to gullible tourists). Elliott, his nemesis, gets the last laugh when a merchant tries to sell him Henry's mummy. Allusions and references to other works Rice credited the authors of several turn-of-the-century mummy stories with her inspiration, including Arthur Conan Doyle (\\"Lot No. 249\\" and \\"The Ring of Thoth\\"), H. Rider Haggard (She), and \\"All who have brought 'the mummy' to life in stories, novels and film.\\" England during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries fell under a fad for Ancient Egypt, a phenomenon also known as Egyptomania which produced many works of fiction which Rice could draw from. It has been argued that William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, as well as other popular culture representations of Cleopatra, have a discernible influence on Rice's novel.. Reception Publishers Weekly called the novel \\"an uneasy marriage of romance and horror ... marinated in sentimentality, melodrama and absurdity ... Missing a ripe opportunity to skewer 20th-century values and sexual mores, [Rice], ever-fascinated with the undead, avoids character and plot development, larding largely lifeless, sloppy prose with a surfeit of epiphanies and calamities.\\" Sequel During a 2014 interview, Rice stated that she had delved back into the fictional universe established in The Mummy and that there was a strong possibility she could pen a sequel. In February 2017, Rice announced a new Ramses novel, co-written with her son, novelist Christopher Rice. Ramses the Damned: The Passion of Cleopatra was published on November 21, 2017.

He campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a candidate of the provincial Conservative Party in the provincial election of 1883, but lost to Liberal candidate Richard Harcourt by 129 votes in the constituency of Monck. He campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1887 federal election, and defeated Liberal incumbent Charles Wesley Colter by a single vote in the riding of Haldimand, 1,746 to 1,745. The Conservatives won this election, and Montague served as a backbench supporter of John A. Macdonald's government. Elections were frequently challenged in this period of Canadian history, and Montague's one-vote victory did not stand official scrutiny. His victory was nullified on October 15, 1887, and a new election was called for the riding on November 12. Montague this time defeated Colter by seventeen votes, and returned to the Commons. The Liberals once again challenged the result, and the second election was voided by the Supreme Court of Canada on December 14, 1888. A third election was called for January 30, 1889, which Colter won by forty-six votes. Colter's victory, however, proved no more solid than Montague's had been. The Conservatives challenged the result of the third election, and its results were set aside on January 22, 1890. A fourth election was called for February 20, 1890, and Montague was again declared elected. He was also returned in the 1891 federal election, defeating Colter by the more convincing margin of seventy-eight votes. This time, the result was not overturned. The Conservatives won the 1891 election, and Montague continued to serve as a government backbencher. He was promoted to cabinet by Prime Minister Mackenzie Bowell on December 21, 1894 as a Minister without portfolio. On March 26, 1895, he was further promoted to Secretary of State of Canada. He held this position until December 21, 1895, when he was named as Canada's Minister of Agriculture. Montague resigned from cabinet on January 5, 1896, to protest against Bowell's inaction on the Manitoba Schools Question. He was part of the group of ministers famously described by Bowell as a \\"nest of traitors\\". After the issue was resolved, he returned to cabinet on January 15. He was retained in the Agriculture portfolio when Charles Tupper replaced Bowell as Prime Minister on May 1, 1896. Montague was easily re-elected in the 1896 federal election in the redistributed riding of Haldimand and Monck. The Conservatives were defeated by Wilfrid Laurier's Liberals, however, and Montague served as an opposition member in the parliamentary that followed. He lost his seat to Andrew Thorburn Thompson by 137 votes in the 1900 election. He returned to his medical practice after his defeat, and moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1908. He returned to political life on November 4, 1913, when he was appointed as Minister of Public Works in Rodmond Roblin's provincial Conservative government. He did not hold a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba at the time, so a by-election was called in Kildonan and St. Andrews for November 29, 1913. This by-election was extremely bitter and divisive. The opposition aggressively attacked Montague's personal life and political record, while the Conservative electoral machine had over 40 cars working the constituency on polling day. Montague was elected, defeating Liberal candidate A.N. Bredin by 370 votes. He was re-elected in the 1914 provincial election by a single vote. The Rodmond government was forced to resign in 1915, after a commission of enquiry called by the Lieutenant Governor found the government guilty of corruption in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. The administration resigned on May 12, 1915, and new elections were called. Montague was not a candidate, and the Liberals won the election in a landslide. Montague was inducted on fraud charges for his part in the contracts scandal, but died in Winnipeg before legal proceedings could begin.

Sunk in the Battle of the Java Sea, Electra was a witness to many naval battles, including the Battle of the Denmark Strait and the sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse. The ship's wreck was discovered in 2003 and had been badly damaged by illegal salvagers by 2016. Description The E-class ships were slightly improved versions of the preceding D class. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Electra carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ships' complement was 145 officers and ratings.Lenton, p. 156 The ships mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The E class was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes.Whitley, p. 103 One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.English, p. 141 Construction and career She was ordered on 1 November 1932 as part of the 1931 Naval Programme; launched on 15 February 1934 at the Hawthorn Leslie Shipyard at Hebburn, Tyneside. The costs to build the ship have been given as approximately ¬£300,000 (Janes), ¬£247,000, or ¬£253,350 (excluding the items supplied by the Admiralty such as guns and communications equipment). Upon commissioning in 1934, she was attached to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, Home Fleet, along with the rest of her sister ships. In September 1935, the 5th Flotilla was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet for the duration of the Abyssinian crisis before returning to the Home Fleet the following March. In 1936, Electra was assigned to Non-Intervention Patrols in Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War. In 1938, she underwent a refit at Sheerness, and then was placed 'in reserve'. On 2 August 1939, she was 'Brought forward' (taken out of reserve) with Reservist ship's company, and on 26 August 1939, she attended a review by King George VI. = Early Second World War service = At the beginning of World War II, Electra was attached to the 12th Destroyer Flotilla. On 3 September 1939, Electra took part in the rescue of survivors of the liner , which was torpedoed by the German submarine . The captain of Electra, Lieutenant-Commander Stuart Austen \\"Sammy\\" Buss, was the Senior Officer present at the scene so he took charge. He sent the destroyer on an anti-submarine sweep of the area, while Electra, her sister ship , the Swedish yacht Southern Cross, the Norwegian cargo ship Knut Nelson, and the American tanker rescued the survivors. Part of the rescue effort included sending a whaler to rescue a woman still in a bunk in the sick bay of Athenia. Between the ships, about 980 passengers and crew were rescued; only 112 people were lost, and Athenia sank the next morning. Her next assignment was to escort a convoy out of Pentland Firth, along with and . During a violent storm which lasted over two days, an ammunition locker on the forecastle broke loose, and was sliding around the deck. The locker was full of shells, and needed to be secured. After a short time, several volunteers managed to corral the loose object. After a boiler cleaning at Rosyth in December 1939, Electra continued escorting convoys and hunting U-boats in the Western Approaches area until April, 1940. Some of the convoys she is known to have escorted include ON 14, HN 14, ON 16, HN 16, ON 18, HN 18, ON 20, and HN 20. = Norway = In early April, 1940, Electra escorted two convoys to Norway and back. The first trip, which also included and the cruiser , was uneventful. On the second trip, the convoy was attacked by German bombers. An ex-Polish liner serving as a transport was sunk, but the rest of the convoy arrived safely. After the convoy was delivered, Electra was tasked to drop off two Army officers at a desolate location. During this time, Electra shot down a German bomber with her 4.7-inch (120 mm) guns. A few days later, Electra, being equipped with Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear, was directed to lead the battleship into Ofotfjord towards Narvik, clearing a path through the minefields for her. However, Admiral Sir William Whitworth decided to risk the mines, and left Electra outside, guarding the entrance to the fjord. on 24 April, Electra escorted from Bogen to Narvik to land the Irish Guards. (See Battles of Narvik). On 8 May, Electra returned to Scapa Flow for replenishment. On 13 June 1940, she escorted the aircraft carrier when she launched an air attack on Trondheim, Norway. In heavy fog, the admiral ordered the formation to turn into the wind so Ark Royal could launch aircraft. The destroyer screen was in arrowhead formation ahead of the capital ships; Electra in the port wing, in the starboard wing. The message \\"Blue nine repeat Blue nine ‚Äì Executive signal.\\" to turn was given on a low-power short range radio. Apparently, the telegraphist of Antelope missed the signal; as a result, Antelope continued on course while Electra executed the turn. Suddenly, Antelope appeared, cutting across the bows of Electra. With no time to stop, Electra hit Antelope aft, in the wardroom pantry, just aft of the engine room. One man from Antelope climbed up Electras anchor chain to get away from the damaged area. Her bow was severely damaged, and it took Electra and Antelope four days to get back to Scotland at slow speed. She was repaired and refitted at the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company yard at Troon, South Ayrshire, Scotland through the end of August. Ailsa was noted primarily for the yachts it has built, and Electra was the largest repair job it had handled to date. Here she had her bow repaired, as well as having her after bank of torpedo tubes replaced by a 3-inch anti-aircraft (AA) gun, and one 20 mm Oerlikon fitted centrally on the light AA platform. Also, during the refit and repair time, the wardroom was painted in the team colours of the Glasgow Rangers football (soccer) team, which was the favourite team of the yard manager heading up the repair work. After conducting post-refit trials on 31 August, she joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, Home Fleet, based at Scapa Flow. Her first assignment after her repair work was completed was to escort the ships of the 1st Minelaying Squadron, along with the destroyers , , and , during the laying of a deep minefield in NW approaches to Irish Sea (Operation SN41). After this, she was part of the escort of the battlecruiser in a hunt for a German surface raider that had attacked Convoy HX 84 sinking the armed merchant cruiser and five ships from the convoy. Electra later joined the search for survivors from the convoy. In December, she was again on patrol seeking a German surface raider that had been reported as breaking out into the North Atlantic. The force consisted of the battlecruiser , the light cruiser , and the destroyers Electra, , , and . After spending a week at sea, including Christmas Day, after the report turned out to be false, she returned to port on New Year's Eve. It was here that they got word that the ship's current Captain, Lieutenant-Commander Buss, was promoted to Commander and would transfer to the destroyer , and the ship received a new Captain, Lieutenant-Commander Cecil Wakeford May, who would be her captain until she was sunk. (Commander Buss was later killed in action on HMS Dulverton on 13 November 1943.) A few days after this, Electra was sent into the Arctic for a mission to find surface raiders, returning through the Denmark Strait and refuelling from a cruiser in heavy seas on the way. The first four months of 1941 saw Electra performing mostly convoy work around the British Isles and Bristol Channel, mostly in cold weather and heavy seas. in January, she escorted the battlecruiser Hood during Operations SN6 and SN65, providing cover for minelaying in the Northern Barrage by ships of 1st Minelaying Squadron. Starting on 23 January, Electra participated in Operation Rubble, the escape of several Norwegian merchant ships from Gothenburg, Sweden. In February, she escorted Convoy WS6A during passage from the Clyde for two days; then in late February, she escorted the battleship during contractor's trials. One of the trips was as escort to convoy HX 122, which left Halifax on 20 April and arrived in Liverpool on 8 May. On one of the trips, she rescued the crew of a Coastal Command Avro Anson patrol aircraft that had crashed into the ocean. In March, Electra and Inglefield escorted the battleship in a search for the German battlecruisers and . In mid-May, Electra took part in Operation SN9B, escorting ships of 1st Minelaying Squadron during the laying of mines in the Northern Barrage. = Hunt for Bismarck = In early May, the British Admiralty was on the alert that might attempt to break out into the North Atlantic. As a consequence, Electra was ordered to Scapa Flow for possible deployment against the Germans. Just after midnight of 21/22 May 1941, Electra sailed along with the destroyers , Antelope, , , and , escorting Hood and Prince of Wales to cover the northern approaches. The intention was that the force would refuel in Hvalfjord, Iceland, and then sail again to watch the Denmark Strait. On the evening of 23 May, weather deteriorated. At 2055 hrs., Admiral Lancelot Holland aboard Hood signalled the destroyers \\"If you are unable to maintain this speed I will have to go on without you. You should follow at your best speed.\\" At 0215 on the morning of 24 May, the destroyers were ordered to spread out at intervals to search to the north. At about 0535, the German forces were sighted by Hood and, shortly after, the Germans sighted the British ships. Firing commenced at 0552. At 0601, Hood took a 38 cm (15-inch) shell from Bismarck in the after magazine, which caused a massive explosion, sinking the ship within two minutes. Electra and other destroyers were about away at the time. Upon hearing that Hood had sunk, Electra raced to the area, arriving about two hours after Hood went down. They were expecting to find many survivors, prepared hot coffee and rum, set up the medical facilities for the casualties, rigged scrambling nets and heaving lines, and placed life belts on the deck where they could be quickly thrown in. From the 94 officers and 1,321 enlisted men who were aboard Hood, only 3 survivors were found. Electra rescued these three and continued searching. Shortly thereafter, Icarus and Anthony joined in the search and the three ships searched the area for more survivors. No more survivors were found, only driftwood, debris, clothing, personal effects, broken rafts and a desk drawer filled with documents. After several hours searching, they left the area. With the sea as cold as it was, survival in the water was measured in minutes. There was little probability that anyone was left alive in the water. (See Battle of the Denmark Strait). After dropping off the survivors in Iceland, she refuelled and then sailed immediately to escort the damaged Prince of Wales to Rosyth. After arriving, the men went on a quick shore leave, their first in many months. Then in a period of two weeks, she went to Scapa Flow, then made a run down the West Coast of England, then to Ireland, then refuelled at Derry and then escorted a troop convoy into the Atlantic. After this, she went into refit at Green & Silley Weir in the Royal Docks at London for six weeks, escorting a convoy to Sheerness on the way. When she came out of the yard, she sported a new disruptive camouflage paint scheme of blues, greens, and greys. Just two days out of the yard, she was on convoy duty again, escorting a convoy through what was called \\"Bomb Alley\\". The convoy came under heavy attack by German aircraft, but suffered no losses. She then went on to Scapa Flow for assignment. = Russian convoy = Shortly after arriving at Scapa Flow, she was detailed to serve as Senior Escort for the first of Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union, called Operation Dervish, which consisted of six merchantmen, escorted by destroyers Electra, and , three s, and three trawlers. The convoy kept well to the west of Norway, and made a wide sweep to avoid the German bases in northern Norway, before turning south to Archangelsk. There were no losses on the trip to Russia, or on the return trip (Russian Convoy QP1) with the destroyer Active, cruisers and , and 11 merchantmen starting on 26 September, and arriving in England on 10 October. (See Dervish Convoy). = To the Far East = On Monday, 20 October 1941, the crew of Electra got word that they, together with , would be escorting HMS Prince of Wales to the Far East under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir Tom Phillips, where the ships would form the nucleus of a new Eastern Fleet intended to deter Japanese aggression. Over the next three days, they loaded with supplies and ammunition, and returned the parkas they had obtained for their Russian trip. On 23 October, they sailed out of Scapa Flow for Greenock, and on 25 October, they sailed for the Far East. This force would be known as Force G until they reached the Far East; then they would be re-designated Force Z. They were accompanied by , loaned by Western Approaches Command, for the first part of the trip. The destroyers refuelled from Prince of Wales south of Ireland. Two days later, another destroyer, , was detached from a Gibraltar convoy to cover Prince of Wales while Electra and Express refuelled again from a tanker in Ponta del Garda in the Azores. After Electra and Express returned the following day, Hesperus and Legion departed for Gibraltar. On 2 November, the three ships put into Freetown. They had shore leave and left the next day. They refuelled on the way and arrived at Cape Town on 16 November, with the destroyers putting into Simonstown Naval Base. The crew had shore leave again, but several events, including press interviews, were cancelled. They left Cape Town on 18 November and arrived at Colombo, Ceylon, on 28 November, stopping at Mauritius and Addu Atoll to refuel on the way. While at Addu Atoll, the crew of Prince of Wales cooked the Addu detachment of Royal Marines a Christmas dinner and sent ashore fresh fruit, meat, vegetables, beer and Navy rum. On 29 November, the destroyers and , detached from the Mediterranean Fleet, joined at Colombo and the five ships sailed later that day. The ships were joined at sea by the battlecruiser Repulse which had sailed from Trincomalee. The force then set course for Singapore, where they arrived on 2 December. They spent a few days there with shore leave and refit, while awaiting orders. On 1 December, it was announced that Sir Tom Philips had been promoted to full Admiral and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Fleet. A few days later, Repulse started on a trip to Australia with and , but the force was recalled. = Force Z at Singapore = Early in the morning of 8 December, Singapore came under attack by Japanese aircraft. Prince of Wales and Repulse shot back with anti-aircraft fire. No planes were shot down and the ships sustained no damage. After receiving reports of the attack on Pearl Harbor and the invasion of Siam by the Japanese, Force Z put to sea at 1730 hrs. on 8 December. Force Z at this time consisted of Prince of Wales and Repulse, escorted by the destroyers Electra, Express, Vampire, and Tenedos. At about 1830 on 9 December, Tenedos was detached to return to Singapore, because of her limited fuel capacity. That night Electra sighted and reported a flare to the north. This caused the British force to turn away to the southeast. The flare was dropped by a Japanese aircraft over its own ships by mistake, and caused the Japanese force to turn away to the northeast. At this point, the two forces were only about five miles (8 km) apart. At 2055, Admiral Philips cancelled the operation and ordered the force to return to Singapore. On the way back, they were spotted and reported by the . The next morning, 10 December, they received a report of Japanese landings at Kuantan and Express was sent to investigate the area, finding nothing. That afternoon, Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk off Kuantan by 85 Japanese aircraft from the 22nd Air Flotilla based at Saigon. (See Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse'). Repulse was sunk by five torpedoes in 20 minutes, and Electra and Vampire moved in to rescue survivors of Repulse, while Express rescued survivors of Prince of Wales, which sank slowly following the attacks. Electra sent out radio messages that Repulse and Prince of Wales had sunk and that Admiral Tom Phillips had gone down with them. Even after they were rescued, some survivors of Repulse manned Action Stations on Electra, to free Electra sailors to rescue more survivors. In particular, Repulse gunners manned the 'X' and 'Y' 4.7-inch mounts and the ship's dentist of Repulse assisted Electras medical teams with the wounded. In total, nearly 1,000 survivors of Repulse were rescued, of which Electra saved 571, some of whom would later be captured at Malaya and the Dutch East Indies when both were surrendered by the British three months later, and some were lost aboard British ships sunk by the Japanese in the Indian Ocean and at the Battle of the Java Sea. Electra and the other destroyers returned to Singapore to drop off the survivors, refuel and replenish their ammunition. = Convoy duty = The next three weeks or so saw Electra escorting convoys, and resting in Singapore in between. She had 'crossed the line' (equator) so many times that the crew stopped keeping count. One of her frequent consorts in these escort operations was the light cruiser . In the last week of January, Electra was part of the escort for a troop convoy, BM-11, consisting of the American transports and and the British ships Duchess Of Bedford, Empress of Japan, and Empire Star, which was carrying troops from Bombay, India, to Singapore. This convoy was brought into Singapore on 29 January via Berhala Strait, Durian Strait, and Philips Channel, and then proceeded to Keppel Harbor. Here, at about 1100 on 31 January, Electra came alongside West Point and transferred 20 naval dockyard personnel, 8 women, one Free French officer, and a Royal Air Force officer to West Point for passage to Ceylon. (One of these women gave birth to a baby on board West Point on 4 February). Some of the convoys that Electra was known to have escorted included: *BM-9B, which left Bombay on 22 December 1941, carrying the vehicles and stores for the 45th Indian Infantry Brigade; Electra escorted this convoy from 3 January 1942 until its arrival at Singapore on 6 January. *BM-10, which left Bombay on 8 January 1942, with the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade Group (6000 men), and vehicles and stores for the 18th Division; Electra was part of the escort between 20 January and 22 January. *BM-11, (mentioned above) which left Bombay on 19 January 1942, carrying 5 light anti-aircraft batteries, 1 light tank squadron, and the 18th Division (except the 53rd Brigade Group), a total of 17.000 troops; Electra was part of the escort from 24 January until its arrival at Singapore on 29 January. *BM-12 Return trip to Bombay; Electra was part of the escort from 7 February to 9 February while the convoy went through the Sunda Strait. Starting on 3 February, they also had the task of towing the destroyer which had been undergoing refit from Singapore to Java. They were attacked by a Japanese high-level bomber on the way, but sustained no damage. (T. J. Cain in his book HMS Electra states that it was an I-class destroyer, and that Electra was the tow ship; Steve Gartland in an article in \\"The Sun\\" states that the destroyer being towed was , that the tow ship was a tug named Ping Wo, and that Electra was an escort out of Tanjong Priok starting on 17 February.) Just before Singapore fell, Electra and other destroyers escorted the remaining merchant ships to Tanjong Priok, Java. = Battle of the Java Sea and loss = On 26 February 1942, Electra arrived at Surabaya from Tanjong Priok, along with , , the Dutch light cruiser , and the destroyers Jupiter and Encounter. , , and HMAS Hobart remained at Tanjong Priok. On 27 February, the striking force left Surabaya, the three British destroyers in the lead, with Electra in the center, Jupiter to port, and Encounter to starboard; followed by the Dutch cruiser , , , HMAS Perth, and HNLMS Java; followed by two Dutch and four American destroyers. (See Battle of the Java Sea.) That afternoon, they made contact with the enemy. Electra managed to evade the shells and torpedoes in the first round. At 1715, Exeter received a hit which destroyed a gun mount and then exploded in a boiler room, causing her to lose speed. At 1725, seeing that Exeter was in trouble, Electra headed toward the enemy ships, followed by the other two British destroyers, to cover Exeters escape. After several near misses from gunfire from the Japanese light cruiser , Electra fired back, scoring several hits on Jints≈´ and the destroyer disabling her engines, she also managed to score hits on destroyers Minegumo and Tokitsukaze. During this slugging match, Electra sustained several hits, which knocked out A and X gun mounts, wrecked the electrical system forward, cut off all communications, destroyed a searchlight platform, damaged the after boiler room, and ruptured the main steam line. Electra came to a stop, fired off her torpedoes, and started to list to port. After a fire started under 'B' gun mount and 'Y' mount ran out of ammunition, abandon ship was ordered. One surviving whaleboat got away after being loaded with wounded, but it was destroyed by a shell shortly after. She sank shortly afterwards on the afternoon of 27 February 1942, bow first, with the White Ensign still flying. = Survivors = That night, about 0235hrs. in the morning of 28 February, 54 survivors of the 173 men on board were picked up by the United States submarine , and were taken to Surabaya. When the submarine surfaced in the middle of the survivors, they were not sure if it was friendly or enemy. One of the survivors recognised the submarine as being friendly, because it had an 'Admiralty' type anchor; and at that time, only United States submarines still had this type of anchor. One of the survivors died on the submarine on the way. After treatment in a Dutch hospital, 42 survivors were taken to Australia by the inter-island steamer Verspeck, where they arrived on 10 March. One more survivor died at the hospital, and 10 others in critical condition were left at the hospital. After spending some time there recovering, many of the survivors were put on the liner Nankin, bound for Ceylon, and ultimately, home to Britain. On the way, Nankin was attacked and sunk by the German raider . The survivors, after spending seven weeks on the raider's supply ship Regensburg, were handed over to the Japanese, where they spent the rest of the war in a Japanese prison camp. On 29 March 1947, a stained glass window at St. George's Chapel at the Royal Naval Barracks, Chatham, was dedicated to the crew of Electra. The wreck On 19 August 2003, the wreck of Electra was found. It is lying on its port side in approximately of water, almost completely covered with fishing nets. Her wreck had been badly damaged by illegal salvagers when an expedition surveyed the site in 2016.https://www.historyanswers.co.uk/history-of- war/java-sea-shipwrecks-of-world-war-2-one-of-the-men-who-found-them-reflects- on-their-loss/ References Bibliography * * Bradford, Ernle The Mighty Hood (World Publishing Company, Cleveland, 1959)    * Middlebrook, Martin and Patrick Mahoney, Battleship: The Sinking of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse, (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1979) * Van der Vat, Dan The Atlantic Campaign: World War II's Great Struggle at Sea (Harper and Row, New York, 1988) * Winslow, W.

Less than a mile to the north is the small town of Craven Arms and 6 miles to the south east is the larger, historical market town of Ludlow. Stokesay was once a civil parish, which covered the land now taken up by Craven Arms. However it merged with Halford parish to form the modern day Craven Arms parish. These two older entities continued as parish wards, however a review of the governance of Craven Arms in 2012 concluded in the abolition of these two wards from May 2013.Shropshire Council Governance Review - Craven Arms The River Onny runs past Stokesay, on its way south, and the bridge which carries the A49 over the river is Stokesay Bridge. Within the former parish, to the south of the hamlet of Stokesay is Stoke Wood and the hamlet of Aldon (); to the northeast is the hamlet of Whettleton (). Nearby, on the outskirts of Craven Arms, is the Shropshire Hills Discovery Centre, with its grass roof easily seen from the A49. Also in Craven Arms is the nearest railway station, which for over a hundred years was named Craven Arms and Stokesay, before a rename in 1974.Christiansen (2001) Chester & North Wales Border Railways p. 53 Attractions The castle viewed from the churchyard Stokesay is famous for Stokesay Castle, a fortified manor house and one of the best preserved and oldest examples of the type in the country. The hamlet, which even today comprises just a church, a working farm and a few houses, was previously known as simply Stoke, a widespread English placename meaning 'enclosure'. The church is dedicated to St John the Baptist and is a rare example of the Commonwealth style (having been rebuilt during the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell's rule). John Derby Allcroft became Lord of the Manor and Patron of Saint John the Baptist church. The film Atonement was filmed in part near Stokesay. According to legend, Stokesay was once the home of two giants, one of whom lived on View Edge, and the other on Norton Camp. They kept their treasure in Stokesay Castle, but upon losing the key to the castle, they both died of grief. Saxon & Norman history In the mid 10th century, the manor of Stoke was held by Wild Edric, a Saxon nobleman, notable for his strenuous resistance to the Normans immediately after the Norman Conquest of England. The Normans wrested the manor from his hands and granted it in their normal fashion to a notable Norman as a reward for his part in the Conquest, one Picot de Say, also known as William de Picot. It was this man who had a house and church built some time after 1068.Raven, M. A Guide to Shropshire, 2005, p.196 =Domesday Book= Stokesay is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Stoches.

He was born near Aughrim, Ireland, in 1811. He came to Aylmer, Lower Canada, Canada, in 1830. After working with a lumber company on the upper Ottawa River, he entered the business himself near Bytown. He founded the town of Eganville in Ottawa Valley on the Bonnechere River, later expanding his operation to the Quyon, Petawawa and Madawaska Rivers. Egan was one of four men to finance the construction of the first flour and sawmill in Aylmer in 1839, and in partnership with Joseph Aumond, he founded the Union Forwarding Company in 1845. In the late 1840s, he began building a number of sawmills. Together with Ruggles Wright, he also operated a steamship transporting goods on the Ottawa River. Egan also played an important role in the development of railways service to the area, including the Bytown and Prescott Railway. He bought James Wadsworth‚Äôs farm at the ‚ÄòFifth Chute‚Äô on the Bonnechere in 1838, which he later developed into the village of Eganville, Ontario. John Egan is known as the namesake for Eganville. He built dams and timber slides along the Bonnechere River and employed thousands of men through lumber camps and transportation. Thanks to Egan‚Äôs interest in red pine and business investments, the surrounding area would become a hub for lumber activity with Eganville at the centre.http://www.bonnechere.ca By 1850, he was the dominant force in the timber trade along the Ottawa River. He had been elected mayor of Aylmer in 1847. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada in the riding of Ottawa County in 1848 and was reelected there in 1851. In 1854, he became the first elected representative for the newly formed riding of Pontiac. A decline in the red pine market forced him into bankruptcy in 1854. He died in 1857 at Quebec City while still representing Pontiac, after two years of ill health. In 1864, the Egan Township in Quebec was named in his honour (see: Egan-Sud, Quebec).

Valenzuela came from the lower ranks of Spanish nobility or hidalgos and his appointment was resented by the grandees, the upper nobility who dominated government appointments. In 1677, he was removed from office and imprisoned in the Philippines; released in 1688, he settled in Mexico City, where he died in 1692. Life The entry to Ronda, where the Valenzuela family settled in 1485 Fernando de Valenzuela was born in Naples in 1636, only son of Francisco de Valenzuela and Leonora de Encisa y Davila. He was baptised in the church of Sant'Anna dei Lombardi on 17 January 1636. Originally from Andalusia, in Southern Spain, the Valenzuela were middle-ranking nobility or hidalgos who served across the Spanish Empire as soldiers and administrators. During the Reconquista in 1485, his great-great grandfather, Fernando de Valenzuela Baena, took part in the capture of Ronda and was rewarded with lands and offices. They remained a prominent local family; his grandfather Gaspar Juan y de Escalante de Valenzuela was the two governor. In 1661, Valenzuela married Maria Ambrosia de Ucedo y Prado; their son Francisco de Ucedo de la Valenzuela became a government officer in the Mexican provinces of Nueva Vizcaya and New Navarre. Career Mariana of Austria, Queen Regent; by Vel√°zquez, 1660 Francisco de Valenzuela reportedly left Ronda after killing a man, although the details are unclear. He served with the Spanish army in Flanders and Milan, before settling in the Kingdom of Naples, then part of the Crown of Aragon. His brother Cristobal was Governor of the town of Barletta, in Apulia and Francisco was appointed Governor or Regidor of Sant'Agata, a town in the Province of Naples. After his death in 1640, Leonora returned to Madrid and secured her son a position as page in the household of Duke of Infantado. From 1648 to 1655, Infantado was successively ambassador to Rome, Governor of Mil√°n, and finally Viceroy of Sicily, before retiring to Spain, where he died in 1657. Valenzuela served in the Spanish army in Italy but his career stagnated and he returned to Madrid in 1659. Two years later, he married Maria Ambrosia de Uceda, lady-in-waiting to Mariana of Austria, who gave him a position in her household as a wedding present. When Philip IV died in 1665, his son Charles II was only three years old and Mariana appointed regent by the Council of Castile. The next decade was dominated by a power struggle between Mariana and Charles' illegitimate half-brother, John of Austria the Younger, (1629-1679). As government became more complex, individual rulers could no longer manage the administrative burden on their own and needed to delegate, hence the use of validos or privados. Often translated as 'favourite', 'trusted advisor' is a better description of the role; it was used in Spain in various forms from the 15th century to the late 18th century and formalised by Philip IV in 1620. English-language biographies of Valenzuela, such as his entry in the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, often reflect the 17th century view women were incapable of ruling without a man and imply a sexual relationship. Rather than depending on one person or 'valido', in reality Mariana used a number of different advisors. John of Austria the Younger; in 1677, he ousted Mariana and arrested Valenzuela The instability that often accompanied royal minorities was heightened by Charles' ill-health and the likelihood he would die childless. The resulting contest between his co-heirs Louis XIV of France and Emperor Leopold split the Spanish political elite into Austrian and French factions. Mariana therefore preferred to rely on a small group of loyalists, who owed their careers to her. In addition to Valenzuela, these included her personal confessor Juan Everardo Nithard, who came with her from Vienna in 1659, and the Marquis de Aytona; all three were accused of being her lovers at one time or another. After Nithard was forced from office in 1669, his role as 'valido' was filled by Aytona; when he died in March 1670, Valenzuela became more prominent. In 1671, he was made a knight of the Order of Santiago and appointed 'Introducer of Ambassadors'; the position still exists and relates to protocol, rather than policy, the holder being responsible for co-ordinating acts and ceremonies related to Spanish foreign policy. In 1673, he was appointed the Queen's Master of Horse, a major position that controlled logistics, royal processions and security. 17th century monarchies used ostentatious display to project power; Valenzuela was put in charge of public entertainments and building works, including the expansion of El Pardo, as well as sports and hunting expeditions for Charles. Such positions were normally held by grandees and in a carefully regulated and hierarchical society, this meant Valenzuela was viewed with great resentment. Manuel Castellano The regency was formally dissolved when Charles turned 14 in 1675, although the Council of Castile agreed his disabilities required Mariana to control the decision-making process. John was sent to Sicily to put down the Messina revolt and Valenzuela made Marquis of Villasierra and Ambassador to Venice; however, he remained in Spain as Captain-General of Granada. Valenzuela was recalled in June 1676 and made Master of Horse for the Royal Household, another post normally held by a grandee. Mariana responded to complaints by making him a grandee, then first minister in November; this was a step too far and on 24 December, a group of senior nobility issued a proclamation denouncing the administration. John was invited to take over government; in January 1677, he entered Madrid with 15,000 troops and despatched Mariana to a convent in Toledo. Valenzuela was stripped of titles and property, then exiled to the Philippines, where he was held in Fort San Felipe. After John's death in 1679, Mariana regained control but Valenzuela was not recalled; he remained in the Philippines until September 1688, when he was allowed to settle in Mexico City. The Viceroy of New Spain was Infantado's nephew, Count Galve; with his help, Valenzuela received a pension and lived in some comfort. His title was restored, but not the grandeeship, while properties at San Bartolom√© and Herrad√≥n de Pinares were returned to his wife in January 1689. He died on February 7, 1692 after being kicked by a horse. Legacy Palacio del Marqu√©s de Villasierra, Ronda The Palacio de Mondrag√≥n in Ronda is also known as the Palacio del Marqu√©s de Villasierra; originally built by the Nasrid emirs, it was extensively remodelled by Fernando de Valenzuela Baena but passed out of the family until reacquired by his great- great grandson in 1675. It is now the town museum. It has been suggested Valenzuela was the inspiration for Victor Hugo's 1838 play, Ruy Blas, although Hugo himself cites other sources. The plot closely resembles other works, including The Lady of Lyons, first played on 14 February 1838, nine months before Huy Blas, and Moli√®re's Les Pr√©cieuses ridicules.

History Willoughby Medical College of Columbus The OSU College of Medicine can trace its roots as far back as March 3, 1834 with the founding of the Willoughby University of Lake Erie in Willoughby, Ohio. Dr. Westel Willoughby (1789‚Äì1844), the school's namesake and first president, oversaw the operation of the school until 1843, when a disagreement among the faculty led to their resignation from the school. In 1847 the disgruntled faculty members started the Willoughby Medical College of Columbus in Columbus, Ohio, receiving a new charter from the Ohio Legislature on January 14, 1847. The inaugural student body consisted of 150 students, including dozens of medical students who had transferred from Willoughby University of Lake Erie. Almost immediately upon opening, the school was contacted by wealthy local business owner Lyne Starling, who offered $35,000 to construct a new hospital and school complex in Columbus. The concept of a hospital dedicated to teaching medical students was groundbreaking at the time. The Ohio State University College of Medicine Class of 1923 The construction of the Starling Medical College, named after its benefactor, was begun in 1848 but was not completed until 1887. Dr. Starling Loving was a trustee, professor, and dean at the Starling Medical College. Dr. Loving facilitated the arrival of the Sisters of the Poor of St. Francis to the area to run the hospital, which was named St. Francis Hospital in 1865. In 1875, during elections for a new chairman of the board, James Fairchild Baldwin and several faculty members left the school and in 1876 founded another medical school, the Columbus Medical College. In 1882, the Columbus Medical College began construction on a new hospital, the Hawkes Hospital of Mt. Carmel, operated by the Sisters of the Holy Cross. In 1892, members of the Columbus Medical College merged with Starling Medical College, angering Baldwin. In 1892, he and several faculty members resigned and started yet another medical school, the Ohio Medical University. The Ohio Medical University built Protestant Hospital, the forerunner of Riverside Methodist Hospitals, which still exists. In 1907, the Ohio Medical University merged with Starling Medical College to form the Starling-Ohio Medical College. The Ohio State College of Medicine was established in 1914 with William Means as the first dean. In the 1940s, the school had a two-year medical education program. In the 1970s, this was extended to three years, and then four years in the 1980s. Admissions Admission to The Ohio State University College of Medicine is highly selective. For the class entering in 2017, OSU received 7,199 applications and interviewed 673 applicants for a class of 197 medical students. The matriculating class had an average GPA of 3.74 and an average MCAT score of 34. Facilities The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center has grown into a large complex with numerous specialty centers, hospitals, and research buildings. 44,000 patients are admitted into the OSU system every year.

The character made numerous brief or more protracted stints until his onscreen death in February 2015; his death written to coincide with the 30th anniversary of EastEnders. Nick Cotton is notably responsible for the death of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton), who is discovered unconscious in the first scene of the programme in 1985 and is revealed in the following episode to have died. Nick's death was scripted as somewhat of a reenactment to Reg's death, as the character dies in the same spot where Reg had died 30 years prior. Nick's primary function is as an antagonist, a drug- user and a murderer. He was conceived by the show's creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. A late inclusion to the original cast line-up, Nick was included based on writer feedback to Holland and Smith's original script, which centred around the murder of Reg Cox, whose killer they had not originally intended to reveal. Nick was created to be the assailant and to provide the show with more dramatic storyline potential. During his time on the show, Nick has embarked on multiple feuds with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick), Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), Mark Fowler (David Scarboro/Todd Carty), Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin), Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nedjet Salih), Pete Beale (Peter Dean), Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock), Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley), Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Eddie Skinner (Richard Vanstone), Charlie Cotton (his late father) (Christopher Hancock) and Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack). Nick is used as an 'out and out villain'. It was suggested by Executive Producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins that unlike other soap characters who behaved badly and required a more nuanced characterisation and redemption, it was possible to use Nick as a complete \\"bad guy\\". A television critic for The Guardian suggested that, for this reason, the character's dastardly motives were rarely questioned by viewers, as his primary function is that of \\"an agent of chaos\\". It was also suggested that Nick's appearances on the show needed to be brief because the level of malevolence he portrays could not be sustained in a character over longer periods. Nick's most prominent relationship is with his mother Dot Cotton (June Brown). It is portrayed as complex, dysfunctional and somewhat cyclical, with Nick perpetually entering his mother's life, her forgiving him for past misdemeanours (including an attempt to kill her to steal her bingo winnings), then being let down when Nick's true intentions are revealed, often ending in his banishment; albeit temporarily before the cycle repeats. Nick's eventual demise in 2015 plays homage to this relationship, with Dot ‚Äì finally realising the extent of Nick's villainous behaviour and accepting his inability to change ‚Äì ultimately deciding to allow Nick to die, rather than seeking medical assistance after he has a fatal reaction to heroin. Her motive being to let Jesus decide whether Nick should live or die. Creation Nick Cotton was the twenty-fourth character invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Nick was not part of Holland's and Smith's original vision for EastEnders, and his creation came about as an afterthought. The first episode of the series was to include the death of an elderly resident, Reg Cox, who had been brutally attacked in his home, and left to die. During the first writers' meeting, where the writers were introduced to the intended characters and early scripts, each independently wanted to know which character had killed Reg. However, Holland and Smith had never intended for the murderer to be unveiled. They had no idea who had killed Reg Cox, and they had felt that \\"the who\\" was not important. The fact that he was dead following an attack was the important issue, and Reg's murder was not intended to be solved, it was only there to tell the audience, from the outset, that Walford was a rough and tough place. The writers opposed this. They accused Holland of throwing away a great opportunity and suggested that a murder hunt would provide an array of dramatic possibilities that would captivate the audience. After deciding that all of the twenty-three original characters were incapable of committing the crime, Holland decided to invent an entirely new character, in the form of Nick Cotton. The original character outline for Nick read: \\"His image is exclusively macho. Vanishes for weeks on end. Mum doesn't ask questions... Unlike Den, Nick is a real crook. Worms his way into people's confidentiality and homes. From then on, lives on his wits. Waiting for the moment to strike; to nick the cash and disappear...Usually chooses his victims who, for one reason or another, are frightened to report him...Nick's a heroin addict\\". As Nick was only intended to be a semi-regular character, Julia Smith was not involved in his casting and the actor John Altman was chosen by the directors. However, she requested he was axed, after he refused to portray Nick having a gay relationship with Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt) because he thought it was out of character. Development and storylines Nick has been described by EastEnders' executive producer Diederick Santer as \\"the show's premier villain\\". An EastEnders Revealed documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who \\"thrived on the pain and the misery of those near to him\\". Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: \\"You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them\\", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that \\"There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever\\". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: \\"It's good to have an out and out villain. I think sometimes you can get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn‚Äôt matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy.\\" John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the \\"wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship\\" Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton (June Brown), and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: \\"There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They‚Äôve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they‚Äôll have changed.\\" Grantham has stated that Dot is the \\"one friend in [Nick's] life\\", while Treadwell- Collins has affirmed: \\"Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot.\\" Concurring with this sentiment, Altman agreed: \\"No matter what he does, she‚Äôll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know.\\" Nick Cotton as he appeared in 1985 The debut episode of EastEnders began with the discovery of elderly resident Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton) unconscious in his flat. Reg later dies and in later episodes it is revealed that he was murdered by Nick. Holland and Smith wanted to introduce the series in a dramatic fashion, and believed the Reg Cox storyline to be a good starting point, allowing various members of the community to be involved with or comment on the circumstances of the old man's murder. Santer has explained that Nick was established as a \\"kind of spitting, snarling beast right from the outset\\", with the end of the first episode seeing Nick granted EastEnders' first drum roll ending as he punched through the glass door window of The Queen Victoria pub after a fight with Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih). After a few weeks of the police investigation, prime suspect Nick left the Square after attempting to mug Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), and in April it was reported that he had been arrested. After Nick's mother, Dot, was introduced to the cast in July, she informed the audience that Nick had managed to get off on probation, and the following month, he returned to Albert Square. Upon his return, he broke into Harold Legg's (Leonard Fenton) surgery and came across Kathy Beale's (Gillian Taylforth) medical records, discovering she had a child at 14 years old. Nick threatens to reveal this to Kathy's husband, Pete (Peter Dean) unless she gives him regular payments. Kathy soon tells Pete the truth, resulting in him giving Nick a beating in the middle of the street. Following this, Den warns Nick to leave the square for good, with the exception of visiting Dot occasionally, or he will face fatal consequences. Nick appears briefly throughout the next few years and eventually meets his father, Charlie (Christopher Hancock) in October 1987 when they both coincidentally turn up to visit Dot. Nick and Charlie make it clear to each other that they don't want each other around. Charlie discovers that Nick is hiding from some criminals after he stole from them and also discovers Nick is hiding from Graham Clark, an old friend of Nick's who went to prison for Nick's crimes. Charlie lets Graham into the house to confront Nick and forces him to leave, or else he will hand him over to the criminals he is hiding from. In 1988, Nick ends up doing prison time for drug offences in Dickens Hill Prison where, coincidentally, Den is being held for arson. It is during this period that the mystery of Reg's murder is finally solved when Nick confessed to Den that he had been responsible. In 1989, Dot learns, through off-screen visits to Nick, that he has married a woman called Hazel (Virginia Fiol), and has a young daughter; Nick had avoided telling her beforehand due to his and Dot's strained relationship. Hazel tracked Dot down in May 1989 and visited her with the child, Dorothy Nicola; Dot was so pleased they visited that she pulled out of attending a Brownie march with Mo Butcher (Edna Dor√©) and Marge Green (Pat Coombs). This is later revealed to be a lie and the baby is revealed to be Hazel's niece. Although Nick is only a semi-regular character, his intermittent appearances were always scripted to make a big impact on the show, as well as all the characters involved in his storylines. He reappeared and left several times during the first few years of the show, causing maximum havoc every time, and it wasn't long before the tabloids had begun to brand the character \\"Nasty Nick\\". Altman has commented: \\"I think they keep bringing Nick back because he's one of the characters on British TV that people just love to hate\\". This dislike of the character by the public was shared by the fictional residents of Walford, with Altman explaining: \\"Every time he comes back he gets shunned by one and all. It's like being the bad cowboy come riding into town - everybody puts down the shutters and locks up the bar.\\" The character's appearance was tailored to suit this unlikable, \\"nasty\\" image, with EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown commenting; \\"When he comes on, you know this guy is bad. He's got the black hair and the scowl and the leather jacket. He is like that, he is a Dickensian baddy.\\" Frankie Fitzgerald, who played Nick's son Ashley Cotton from 2000 to 2001, agreed: \\"The look of Nasty Nick, you know, he was a bad guy. Even when he gets dressed up in a suit, he's still got the earring, he's still got the rings, he's still got the tattoo on his neck.\\" One of Nick's most notable returns to the series occurred in 1990. Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim that he was a born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her ¬£10,000 win on the bingo. EastEnders writer Sarah Phelps explained: \\"For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick knew that. It was sort of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet.\\" With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his newfound faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast composed of Nick, Dot, Charlie, Ethel and Alistair, the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the \\"one time we saw a glimmer of Nick's good side\\", Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her. Nick's heroin addiction (1991) Nick was not away from Walford for long. In 1991, he returned with a heroin addiction but Dot initially shunned him and ignored his pleas for help. It was only after discovering Charlie had died that Nick was her only family left and was determined to reform him. Discussing the storyline, Altman has said: \\"I found the heroin addiction quite exhausting actually, because I grew a really thick beard and my hair was always really filthy. When I was shooting those scenes I met with a guy who was an addict, and he told me things that you go through, like you can‚Äôt relax when you‚Äôre trying to come off it. You can‚Äòt sleep so you drink loads of alcohol to try and kill the pain. The clock barely seems to move. For me as an actor, they really let me go as far as I could on that. We had letters as well from people saying how it‚Äòs put them off heroin for life, so I guess we did a good job.\\" As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey with the help of Pete Beale. During this period, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle is murdered. The murder was the key storyline of the show during the autumn of 1991. The episode Eddie was murdered was written by Tony McHale, it finished with a cliffhanger featuring Clyde Tavernier in the gardens standing over Eddie's body and holding a knife, which Nick witnessed from his bedroom window. Nick tells the police what he saw, leading to Clyde going on the run with the help of Michelle Fowler. Joe Wallace eventually came forward, saying he saw Nick out on the square on the night of Eddie's murder, having escaped his room and climbed down a drain pipe. Nick confesses to Dot that he was responsible but insists that it was an accident. Nick is subsequently arrested and charged with Eddie's murder and he stands trial in January 1993. A week's worth of episodes were devoted to the trial, and were all written by Tony Jordan. To present the story of Nick's trial the programme-makers themselves had to review the evidence and watch the episodes leading up to the death of Eddie. In the end, although it was clear that Nick was responsible for stabbing Eddie, it was not clear that it was murder and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Altman summarised: \\"Through having a really good defence and lying his head off once again, he got away with murder\\". Nick was written out of the show along with Dot when June Brown (who plays Dot) decided to depart from the series in August 1993. Their departing storyline introduced his partner, Zoe and young son, Ashley to Dot, who was initially convinced that Zoe was attempting to con her, as she remembered the incident with Hazel several years before. Once Dot was convinced Nick was being truthful, however, she quickly grew close to Ashley, and the family moved to Gravesend together. This would be the last time Dot and Nick would be onscreen for several years until 1997, when June Brown was persuaded to reprise her role as Dot. Upon her return, Dot explained that Nick had been arrested yet again off-screen for drugs possession, and that Zoe and Ashley had moved away, tired of his criminal acts. Shortly after her return, she was informed by police that Nick had escaped prison with his cellmate, Damion Spinks. Damion comes looking for Dot, telling her that Nick cheated him out of money. He keeps her hostage overnight and soon leaves after finding her money. The following day, the police reveal that Damion is in intensive care, put there by Nick. John Altman reprised his role as Nick after a five-year absence in March 1998. He ran into Dot's close friend Nigel Bates who told him to stay away. He returned a few weeks later after Dot discovered him hiding in her house. He tells Dot that he is dying of AIDS caused by his drug addiction, and that he was planning an armed robbery to pay for his medication. Dot believed Nick and arranged the money for him but soon discovered he had been lying about his illness all along, and had him rearrested and sent back to prison. In October 2000, a special 'soap-bubble' titled Return of Nick Cotton aired. The episode centred around Nick's release from prison, his reconciliation with his son, and even featured Nick's father Charlie, making a brief cameo appearance as a ghost almost a decade after his character was killed off. The episode paved the way for Nick's subsequent return to Walford, where he reignited an old feud with Mark Fowler after he discovered Nick was supplying his younger brother Martin Fowler with ecstasy. On New Year's Day 2001, Mark spikes Nick's drink and lures him to the top of the viaduct in Bridge Street and watches as an intoxicated Nick falls, severely crippling himself. Following this, Nick orders Ashley to set fire to Mark's house but he cannot go through with it and leaves Walford after Nick disowns him. Following this, Nick temporarily departs to a spinal unit in February 2001. Mark gets his revenge on Nick After three months away, he returned in May 2001; he was able to walk, but still needed crutches. This comeback was going to be even shorter than his previous one, and followed by a much longer absence from the show. Determined to continue the feud with Mark, Nick starts making threats to Mark's pregnant girlfriend Lisa and soon causes the death of Ashley after sabotaging the brakes on Mark's motorbike, only for Ashley to steal and crash it. Following Ashley's death, Dot overhears an argument between Nick and Mark and realises that Nick had tampered with the brakes on Mark's motorbike. After Ashley's funeral, Dot banishes Nick from her life and tells him to leave and never return, as she would never be able to forgive him. However, Santer explains: \\"There will always be a way back to Dot for Nick\\", a position supported by EastEnders writer James Payne, who states: \\"[Dot] believes, I think, deep down, that he has the potential for change, that he can be a good boy. I think that she‚Äôll keep wishing that.\\" The first steps towards reconciliation were made in 2006 when Jim Branning received a phone call from Nick who was in a prison hospital with cancer. Jim and his grandson, Bradley initially kept this a secret from Dot, but Bradley told his girlfriend, Stacey who let it slip to Dot. Dot went to visit Nick but when he was cleared of his cancer, he refused to let Dot see him. On 2 October 2008 it was reported that Nick would return to EastEnders on Christmas Day that year after more than seven years away. Executive producer Diederick Santer spoke of his excitement at Nick's return, hailing the character as an \\"EastEnders legend\\" and \\"one of the show's best- remembered and best-loved villains\\". Altman stated: \\"After an absence of seven years, I am thrilled to return to Albert Square. The BBC have always given me great storylines as Nick Cotton and I look forward to seeing if Nick will once again spread fear and loathing throughout the Square!\\" June Brown revealed that she had been asking producers to bring Altman back to the soap for 6 or 7 years, as the two of them share such a good working relationship. After spending time in Walsall, Cotton returns; walking normally again, and he is accompanied by his seven-year-old daughter, Dotty. He explained that he had met Dotty's mother Sandy while living in a squat, and that she was an alcoholic who had recently died, leaving him with custody of Dotty. Altman explained: \\"Nick needed something, because I think if he didn‚Äôt have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast.\\" The actor described other changes to his character since his last appearance, detailing how he had become a plumber, begun dressing more smartly, stopped gelling his hair back and no longer wore an earring. Although suspicious to begin with, Dot accepted them both into her home, believing that Nick truly had changed this time. Asked whether Nick really was a reformed character, Altman remained ambiguous: \\"Nick's back, he's got a cute little daughter. He's become a plumber, he's a changed man. ...Or is he?\\" As the storyline progressed, Nick's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty. In a further plot twist, it was revealed to the audience in 2009, that Dotty (real name Kirsty) was colluding with her father all along. In the storyline, Dotty suggested killing Dot for her life assurance policy. Nick leaves following this, allowing Dotty to work on Dot and he returns three months later where they begin their plan to convince Dot and her friends that she is suffering with dementia; Nick's aim being to kill Dot and blame her death on her deteriorating mental state. During Nick's brief stay in the square, he overheard Billy Mitchell telling Dot how he let Jase Dyer die and Nick blackmailed Billy by demanding regular payments or he would tell Jase's son Jay what Billy did. When Billy's cousin, Phil, found out about this, he led Nick into the barrel store of The Queen Vic, where he beats him up and ties him to a chair. Phil gave Billy the opportunity to scare Nick off and end this, however, Billy let him go and told Jay the truth himself. The plot with his own daughter to kill his beloved mother climaxes on-screen in June 2009: Nick's plan goes awry after Dotty has a change of heart and ultimately rescues her grandmother from being poisoned, instead drugging Nick. This leads to a series of events whereby Nick, in a bid to escape once his plan has been exposed, holds various members of the community hostage in the caf√© and an accidental fire is started after Heather Trott pushes Nick into the chip pan. The hostages manage to escape due to a fight between Nick and Ryan Malloy, who was one of the hostages. This results in an explosion at the caf√© with Nick and Bradley Branning inside. The storyline marked Altman's departure from the show once again.< His departing episode was scripted as a cliffhanger, as it was not revealed whether Nick had survived the explosion at the end of the episode. However, in the following episode, on 4 June 2009, Nick is shown to survive the explosion and Bradley is hospitalised with injuries to his eye. Nick departs after once again being disowned by Dot. Dotty is left in Dot's care despite Nick explaining to his mother that Dotty is evil. In January 2014, Dot's lodger Poppy Meadow receives a phone call from Nick, who wants to speak to Dot. After being told by Sharon Rickman that Nick is bad news, she refuses to let him talk to her. Two months later, Dot is told by the police that Nick has died of respiratory failure from a heroin overdose the previous week. One of the police officers who breaks the news to Dot is Nick's son Charlie Cotton. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne back in the 1980s. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from looking in the coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne to tell the truth and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive. Following this, it is revealed that Charlie has been impersonating a police officer and is actually a caretaker at a care home where Yvonne works. Charlie leaves work to find his car windows have been smashed, with a message from Nick, confirming he'd done it. In October 2014, Nick re-appears in Albert Square, seven months after his faked death. Executive Producer Dominic Treadwell Collins promised to deliver the Ultimate Nasty Nick storyline and it would be the Nick story to end all Nick stories. Charlie and his fianc√© Ronnie Mitchell are horrified to find Nick in Dot's house. Nick blackmails them for ¬£10,000 by the end of the day, or he will reveal to Dot that he is alive. Charlie asks Phil for a loan, he agrees but unbeknown to Charlie, he gives him a bag full of paper and when Charlie gives it to Nick he finds out there is no money. On Halloween night, Charlie reveals to Dot that Nick is alive, he goes to find him but while he is gone, Dot finds him in her house. Nick reveals that he was involved in a robbery at a jeweller's and Charlie convinced him to fake his death. Dot agrees to hide Nick until they can raise enough money for him to leave. During this time, Dot is once again manipulated by Nick and starts to become happy that he is there, believing she can finally have a mother-son relationship with him. Fed up being stuck in Dot's house, Nick decides to go outside but is spotted by Ian Beale, who tells Phil and Sharon that Nick is alive. Phil goes round to Dot's house to attack Nick but is stopped by Ronnie. Ronnie tries to bribe Nick to leave by stealing ¬£100,000 of Phil's money but he returns for Charlie and Ronnie's wedding. Having overheard Ronnie and Phil talking about killing him to get rid of him once and for all, Nick decides to cut the brakes on Ronnie's car. After she goes into labour at the wedding reception, Ronnie, Charlie and her sister, Roxy are involved in a car accident which later kills Emma Summerhayes, while Ronnie is left in a coma. Yvonne discovers that Nick cut the brakes of the car but he convinces her to frame Phil by planting the oily rag in his coat pocket. Yvonne tells Charlie what Nick has done but he does not believe her until he catches Nick with some of the money Ronnie used to bribe him. Then Nick implicates Yvonne in Ronnie's accident so Charlie tells them both to leave. Dot hides Nick in the derelict house next door and obtains heroin for Nick. Dot's lodger Fatboy finds out and urges her to stop so when she sees Nick she urges him to confess to the police about framing Phil for Ronnie's sake but he says he does not care about Ronnie, telling her he hopes she rots. Later, Dot finds Nick unconscious but he regains consciousness briefly. During his final moments, Nick reveals to Dot that he was responsible for Reg Cox's death in 1985. Nick dies in Dot's arms, in the same location that Reg was discovered thirty years prior. Dot confesses to letting Nick die to Charlie who plans to get rid of Nick's body with Les Coker's help to save Dot from going to prison. In the live episode aired on 19 February 2015 to coincide with the thirtieth anniversary of the show, the very first scene from the show's first episode was recreated. Stacey, Martin and Kush Kazemi find Nick's body in the same way Den Watts, Arthur Fowler and Ali Osman found Reg Cox thirty years earlier. Dot confesses to killing Nick and is taken away by police. His body is removed from the house the following day. Three months later, Dot receives 14 months in prison for Nick's manslaughter but she is later released after four months. Nick's funeral takes place in June 2015 with only Charlie, Roxy and his grandson, Matthew in attendance. Reception Nick Cotton has become one of EastEnders' most renowned villains. His 'nastiness' was voted the 25th \\"Greatest Soap Moment\\" in a Five poll in 2004, and he has also been voted the 4th most villainous television character in a Channel 4 poll.\\"Television polls\\", Custard.tv. URL last accessed on 2006-10-26. The Guardian columnist Charlie Brooker has denied Nick's villainous characterisation, however, writing: \\"The man simply isn't menacing; he's half as terrifying as an Argos catalogue. Whereas [Coronation Street villain] Jez Quigley looked as though he'd enjoy riding an onyx stallion through a field full of groaning, recently-impaled victims before galloping home to bathe in the blood of the fallen, Nick Cotton merely looks like he might, at a push, dispute the price of a dented tin of custard with a supermarket checkout girl while you wait behind him, wondering when he last washed his hair.\\" The Times's Fiona McCade satirised the character when Altman appeared on the children's TV show Balamory, advising parents to: \\"be prepared to cover your little ones‚Äô eyes as the bad boy of soap strides into the colourful, fictional paradise, no doubt goosing Miss Hoolie, upsetting PC Plum and making Josie jump. I also fear for the safety of Archie, the chubby, cheerful posh boy who wears a pink kilt and lives alone in a big pink castle. With Nick in town, he doesn't stand a chance.\\" John Altman was nominated for 'Villain of the Year' at The British Soap Awards 2015, but lost out to Hollyoaks star, Jeremy Sheffield.

The band were officially formed in 1997 as a reaction to what was an apparent commercialization of the punk genre. Their first demo was released in 1998 and their first official release came in 1999 when newly founded indie label Geykido Comet Records released the band's song Education as a limited edition 7\\" vinyl. In 2002 the band signed to Anti-Flag's label A-F Records which released their self-titled full-length album in spring 2003. In June 2007, Intro5pect toured the United Kingdom and Mainland Europe. Around this time the band's new demo \\"War At Home\\" was spot-played several times by BBC Radio 1 DJ Mike Davies on his punk rock show 'The Lockup'. On October 16, 2007, the EP Realpolitik was released, featuring Stza from Left√∂ver Crack on vocals. In Summer 2008, the band embarked on their second tour of the United Kingdom alongside Moral Dilemma and this time played several headline shows at such venues as the Camden Underworld, finishing the tour at White Rabbit in Plymouth with a special rendition of rock and roll featuring Craig Temple of Moral Dilemma on guitar and Joey Blues of Kill Youth Culture on mandolin. Further support came from Mike Davies who this time had the band in to do a live session at the Maida Vale Studios. The show was broadcast the following week on BBC Radio 1. Upon returning home from this tour, the band and bassist Gregg parted ways due to creative differences. After an extensive search LandonHell was drafted in to fill the void. In a 2009 interview with PunkCDSampler, Sara declared that \\"The new album sounds like the self-titled one, to the extreme\\". The EP Record Profits was released later that Summer.

History It was founded in 1960 as Hori Productions („Éõ„É™„Éó„É≠„ÉÄ„ÇØ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ Hori Purodakushon) and changed to its present name in 1990. Horipro has two locations in the United States: Nashville and Los Angeles. In the 1970s, one of Hori Productions' most famous stars was singer Momoe Yamaguchi. In 1989, Horipro purchased the publishing assets of famed rock band Kiss. Next, the company moved on to invest in more catalogs. A year later, HoriPro Entertainment Group opened their first U.S. location in Nashville, Tennessee. Over the years, Horipro's songwriters would go on to write many hits for some of Country music's most recognized voices. In the late 1990s, Horipro planned to create a \\"virtual idol\\", an electronic rendition using motion capture methods of Kyoko Date. The virtual idol based on Date charted in Tokyo in 1996, and provided inspiration for the character of Idoru in William Gibson's eponymous novel. In 2006, Horipro's first Los Angeles location opened. The company's catalog has expanded to include over 13,000 songs in each major genre. HEG's Los Angeles location is in partnership with Horipro Music Academy, a music enrichment school for children. Additionally, HEG Los Angeles began MusicTaste, a boutique artist development label that is placed within the publishing company. MusicTaste's artists include Matt Palmer, Dori Caymmi, and more. Horipro contracted with MediaHorse, an American music licensing and marketing firm, in 2015 for synchronization licensing in the United States.

Background Colorado State University is a public university in Fort Collins, Colorado, and the University of Wyoming is a public university in Laramie, Wyoming. The two campuses are around 65 miles apart via U.S. Route 287. Football =Bronze Boot= In 1968, the ROTC detachments of the respective schools initiated the Bronze Boot, a traveling trophy awarded to the winner of the ‚ÄúBorder War‚Äù each year. The boot was worn in the Vietnam War by Cpt. Dan J. Romero, an Adams State College graduate and Army ROTC instructor at CSU between 1967 and 1969. Each year leading up to the Colorado State‚ÄìWyoming game, the game ball is carried in a running shuttle relay by the ROTC detachment of the visiting team along US 287 to the Colorado‚ÄìWyoming border, where the home team's ROTC detachment receives it and runs the game ball to the stadium hosting the game. The trophy is guarded by the ROTC unit of the past year's winning school during the game. =Series results= Bronze Boot trophy at the University of Wyoming in 2007.

In the days before the game, a Colorado State student's Facebook post proposing a \\"Cowboys vs. Indians\\" theme in which Colorado State fans would dress in Native American style. This post attracted backlash and discussion within campus, and the student deleted his post and apologized for it. *March 6, 2013: Colorado State won at Laramie, 78‚Äì56. However, this game became controversial because Wyoming students chanted \\"alcoholic\\" at Colorado State coach Larry Eustachy, a recovering alcoholic. At the game, fliers created by interns at the Wyoming athletics marketing office were distributed and made light of an infamous 2003 photo showing Eustachy, then the head coach at Iowa State, partying with University of Missouri students after the Missouri Tigers beat Iowa State.

(The usual architectural term in eighteenth-century England and North America was \\"Dutch roof\\".) The upper slope is positioned at a shallow angle, while the lower slope is steep. This design provides the advantages of a sloped roof while maximizing headroom inside the building's upper level and shortening what would otherwise be a tall roof. The name comes from the Medieval Latin word gamba, meaning horse's hock or leg. The term gambrel is of American origin,Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., \\"Gambrel:4\\". the older, European name being a curb (kerb, kirb) roof. Europeans historically did not distinguish between a gambrel roof and a mansard roof but called both types a mansard. In the United States, various shapes of gambrel roofs are sometimes called Dutch gambrel or Dutch Colonial gambrel with bell- cast eaves, Swedish, German, English, French, or New England gambrel. The cross-section of a gambrel roof is similar to that of a mansard roof, but a gambrel has vertical gable ends instead of being hipped at the four corners of the building. A gambrel roof overhangs the fa√ßade, whereas a mansard normally does not. Origin and use of the term Gambrel is a Norman English word, sometimes spelled gambol such as in the 1774 Boston carpenters' price book (revised 1800). Other spellings include gamerel, gamrel, gambril, gameral, gambering, cambrel, cambering, chambrelA New English Dictionary on Historical Principles: Founded Mainly ..., Volume 4. p. 36. referring to a wooden bar used by butchers to hang the carcasses of slaughtered animals. Butcher's gambrels, later made of metal, resembled the two-sloped appearance of a gambrel roof when in use. Gambrel is also a term for the joint in the upper part of a horse's hind leg, the hock. In 1858, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. wrote: An earlier reference from the Dictionary of Americanisms, published in 1848, defines gambrel as \\"A hipped roof of a house, so called from the resemblance to the hind leg of a horse which by farriers is termed the gambrel.\\" Websters Dictionary also confusingly used the term hip in the definition of this roof. The term is also used for a single mansard roof in France and Germany. In Dutch the term 'two-sided mansard roof' is used for gambrel roofs. Origins of the gambrel in North America The origin of the gambrel roof form in North America is unknown.Kelly, John Frederick. Early domestic architecture of connecticut. Unknown: 1924, Dover Publications, Inc. reprint 1963. 63. The oldest known gambrel roof in America was on the second Harvard Hall at Harvard University built in 1677.Harris, Cyril M.. American architecture: an illustrated encyclopedia. New York: W.W. Norton, 1998. 144. Possibly the oldest surviving house in the U.S. with a gambrel roof is the c. 1677‚Äì78 Peter Tufts House. The oldest surviving framed house in North America, the Fairbanks House, has an ell with a gambrel roof, but this roof was a later addition. Claims to the origin of the gambrel roof form in North America include: # Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and English mariners and traders had visited or settled into the area of southeast Asia now called Indonesia prior to permanent European settlement in America. In Indonesia, they saw dwellings with a roof style where the end of a roof started as a hip and finished as a gable end at the ridge. The gable end was an opening, to allow smoke to dissipate from the cooking fires. This roof design was brought back to Europe and the American Colonies, and adapted to local conditions. The roof style is still in use around the world today; # seamen who traveled to the Netherlands brought the design back to North America; # or practical reasons such as a way to allow wider buildings, the use of shorter rafters, or to avoid taxes.Robert E.

Morrow was born to William Morrow and Nancy Booth, an Irish family in Mille-Isles, Canada East (now Quebec). His father was a member of the 11th Argenteuil Rangers during the Fenian raids of 1866. Morrow was educated at common school, and worked as a farmer. He moved to Manitoba in 1879, and served as councillor and reeve of the Rural Municipality of Louise for ten years. Morrow married Mary A. McDougall in 1883. In religion, he was a Presbyterian. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held in the constituency of Manitou on October 31, 1911, after incumbent member Robert Rogers resigned to run for the House of Commons of Canada. Morrow was elected without opposition, and served as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Roblin's government. He was re-elected by seventy votes over Liberal I.H. Davidson in the 1914 provincial election. The Roblin administration was forced to resign in 1915, after a report commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor found the government guilty of corruption in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. A new election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. Morrow was not a candidate for re-election. He died at the Grace Hospital in Winnipeg.

At some point, this lineup also included fellow original members Roby and Hensley, leaving Donna as the only original member not participating. Rhythm guitarist Roy Hensley (born on December 31, 1947) died on June 8, 2005, at the age of 57, and was buried in Lewisville, Minnesota. In 2006, all five members of the classic Castaways lineup were inducted into the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with the group's former producer, Timothy B. Kehr accepting the award on behalf of posthumous inductee Hensley. The Castaways with original band leader Jim Donna continue to perform for fairs, festivals, and private events in the upper Midwest. Dennis Craswell still performs today under the name The Original Castaway in and around Detroit Lakes, Minnesota and the Rio Grand Valley in Texas.

Located on 721 Government Street, it is situated in Downtown Victoria, facing the city's Inner Harbour. The hotel was designed by Francis Rattenbury, and was built by Canadian Pacific Hotels, a division of the Canadian Pacific Railway company. The hotel is presently managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, part of AccorHotels since 2016. It is owned by Nat and Flora Bosa of Vancouver. Opened on 20 January 1908, the Ch√¢teauesque-styled building is considered one of Canada's grand railway hotels. Since its opening, the hotel has undergone two expansions, the first from 1910 to 1912, and a second expansion in 1928. The building was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada on January 1981. The Empress underwent a significant restoration between 2015 and 2017, which cost more than $60M. The hotel commemorated the restoration efforts on 28 June 2017. Location Inner Harbour is located west of the hotel, on the other side of Government Street. The Fairmont Empress sits at 721 Government Street, at the southern end of Downtown Victoria, the central business district for Victoria, British Columbia. The hotel property is bounded by Humboldt Street to the north, Belleville Street to the south, and Government Street to the west. To the east of the hotel is the Victoria Conference Centre, a conference centre connected to the hotel via the conservatory in 1989. The hotel provides catering for the conference centre. The conference centre and hotel are bounded by Douglas Street on the east. Located at the southern end of Downtown Victoria on Government Street, the hotel is situated close to the British Columbia Parliament Buildings. The hotel is also situated closely to the city's Inner Harbour, a major tourist attraction located west of the hotel, across Government Street. Other major attractions located adjacent to the hotel include the Maritime Museum of British Columbia and the Victoria Bug Zoo, both located north of the hotel, across Humboldt Street. The hotel building was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada by Parks Canada. The hotel was designated a National Historic Site on 15 January 1981 for its contribution to the development of the Chateauesque style of architecture. Design =Architecture= Designed in a Chateauesque-style, The hotel features steep pitched roofs, gables, and polygonal turrets. Shortly after acquiring the property, Canadian Pacific Hotels, a division of Canadian Pacific Railway, announced its plan to construct a new hotel, similar to the company's other Chateauesque grand railway hotels. Designed by Francis Rattenbury, the hotel was built from 1904 to 1908. Rattenbury's initial plans featured a seven-story hotel similar to the Chateau Frontenac in Quebec City. Incorporating elements of French Renaissance architecture, his designs featured an enormous entrance hall, and a glass-roofed palm garden decorated in a Chinese motif. After months of delays, Rattenbury was relieved as the building's architect on 5 December 1907, with design responsibilities falling to William Sutherland Maxwell, the chief architect for Canadian Pacific Railway. Like most Chateauesque hotels, the Empress incorporates stone and brick cladding, steep pitched copper roofs, ornate neo-Gothic dormers and gables, and polygonal turrets. However, the design of the hotel also deviates from earlier Chateauesque hotels owned by the company, incorporating elements from contemporary architectural styles into its design. The hotel's porch featured elements of Tudor architecture, the main roof of the hotel was designed in a Second Empire style with a flat top and iron railings. The building features an asymmetrical floor plan, with an interior featuring arcaded central loggia, and projecting pavilions accented by oriel windows. The Empress was enlarged twice since it opened, with William Sutherland Maxwell designing the building's first expansion, from 1910 to 1912. The building's second expansion was completed in 1928. Much of the building's exterior brick was covered in an overgrowth of ivy, until renovations from 2014 to 2017 saw the bricks repointed and the ivy removed. The removal of the plants was done in order to prevent damage to the bricks, as well as preventing animals from living within the overgrowth. =Facilities= Afternoon tea at the Lobby Lounge, one of several restaurants at the hotel. The Empress includes 464 guest rooms and suites spread throughout the hotel building. A number of rooms at The Empress are also used by restaurants and other food-based services. Restaurants located within the restaurant include the Lobby Lounge, Q at the Empress Restaurant, and the Q Bar. The restaurants were all redesigned in 2017 by the Puccini Group, a San Francisco-based interior design firm. The restaurants features a purple, hardwood floor, and textured-fabric chandeliers. The hotel's afternoon tea service is held at the Lobby Lounge. The Willow Stream Spa is a spa facility located within the hotel. It includes a Finnish sauna, steam inhalation room, and mineral pool. The hotel also operates a fitness centre with an indoor pools, and a hot tub. History The Chateauesque was designed by Francis Rattenbury for Canadian Pacific Hotels as a terminus hotel for Canadian Pacific's steamship line, whose main terminal was just a block away. The hotel was to serve business people and visitors to Victoria, but later as Canadian Pacific ceased its passenger services to the city, the hotel was successfully remarketed as a resort to tourists. Victoria emerged as a tourist destination beginning in the mid-to-late 1920s. The Empress in August 1930, years after the hotel's expansion in 1928. The hotel was built between 1904 and 1908, opening for service in that year. Additional wings were added between 1909 and 1914, and in 1928. In 1919, Edward, Prince of Wales attended a gala at the hotel's Crystal Ballroom. In the 1930s, Shirley Temple arrived accompanied by her parents amid rumours that she had fled from California because of kidnapping threats, a story borne from the presence of two huge bodyguards who took the room opposite hers and always left their door open. On May 30, 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth attended a luncheon at the Empress during their 1939 royal tour of Canada. For many years the hotel did not have a sign above the front entrance. In 1965, debate to tear down The Empress to make room for a more modern, functional high-rise hotel surfaced. One local newspaper warned that, \\"Without this splendid relic of the Edwardian era, literally tens of thousands of tourists will never return. This is the Mecca, this is the heart and soul of the city.\\" However, on 10 June 1966, the hotel's ownership announced that they would not be demolished, but would embark on a $4 million renovation and refurbishment program, playfully dubbed Operation Teacup. In 1989, over $45 million was spent in additional restoration known as The Royal Restoration. Guest rooms were renovated, and a health club, indoor swimming pool and guest reception were added. During these renovation, the engineering staff from the hotel confirmed that there was what has been described as a tunnel that ran from James Bay into the basement of the Empress. At high tide one was able to visit the basement and see the salt water flood the opening. It is not clear what the purpose was. Some have suggested that it was part of the hotel's waste management system and that at one time the sewage from the hotel was being flushed into James Bay. In 1999, Canadian Pacific spun off Canadian Pacific Hotels, along with all its properties. The new company was renamed Fairmont Hotels & Resorts in an effort to reflect its growing global presence and ambitions. As such, all former CP Hotel properties were to be renamed and rebranded with the prefix 'Fairmont'. This led to a loud uproar and consternation by Victoria's newspapers and its citizens, a decision they viewed as sacrilege. Although the new name stuck, Fairmont made no changes to the hotel's original exterior signage, as a compromise to soothe local anxieties and respect its heritage. Fairmont later sold the hotel on October 31, 2000, to the Legacy Hotels REIT for CAD $120 million. However, Fairmont has a long-term management agreement with Legacy Hotels, and as of August 2005, held an 11.14% ownership in this REIT. The hotel was sold again on June 27, 2014, to Vancouver-based owners, Nat and Flora Bosa. They invested more than $60 million in renovations. On May 2017, the first phase of restoration work and renovation was completed at the hotel. The renovations included redesigns of the guest rooms and suites, spa, dining facilities, and reception lobby.

A papyrus roll containing fragments from seven of his Cynic poems was discovered at Oxyrhynchus in 1906. Life Cercidas was an admirer of Diogenes, whose death he recorded in some Meliambic lines.Diogenes Laertius, vi. 76. He is mentioned and cited by AthenaeusAthenaeus, viii., xii. (who cites him as a source for the cult of Venus Kallipygos) and Stobaeus.Stobaeus, iv. 43, lviii. 10. At his death he ordered the first and second books of the Iliad to be buried with him.Ptolemaeus Hephaestus, ap. Photius, Cod. 190. AelianAelian, Varia Historia, xiii. 20. relates that Cercidas died expressing his hope of being with Pythagoras of the philosophers, Hecataeus of the historians, Olympus of the musicians, and Homer of the poets, which clearly implies his esteem for these four disciplines. He commanded his city's infantry contingent at the battle of Sellasia in 222 BC. He appears to be a descendant of Cercidas the Arcadian,Williams, F: \\"Cercidas: The Man and the Poet\\",Beyond the Canon = Hellenistica Groningana 11. Page 345. Peeters, Leuven who is mentioned by Demosthenes among those Greeks, who, by their cowardice and corruption, enslaved their states to Philip II of Macedon. In _Sophists, Socratics and Cynics_ , D. Rankin notes that Cercidas ‚Äúwas active in the politics of his city‚Ä¶[and]‚Ä¶was appointed _nomothetes_ , or legislative commissioner, with the task of drawing up a new constitution‚Äù. But in his poetry, he was a harsh critic of the wealthy, and called for justice and revenge (Nemesis) upon them, also invoking Fortune, asking why she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúreduce to poverty the profligate Xenon and give us the money now running to futility?‚Äù. He refers to the profligate wealthy as ‚Äúdirty-cheat usurers‚Äù misusing their ‚Äústink-pig wealth‚Äù, as misers, and \\"ruin merchants\\". He invokes Justice and asks why she ‚Äì and all the gods on Olympus ‚Äì are so blind. But most significant is his invocation of Nemesis, ‚Äúthe spirit of earthly retribution‚Äù to attack the wealthy for their profligacy and to attack the system of wealth itself, rather than specific acts of injustice or inequality - a profound theme of the Cynics. Poetry An Oxyrhynchus papyrus with the title \\"the meliambic poems of Cercidas the Cynic\\" () was discovered in 1906.Oxyrhynchus papyrus, no. 1082. Meliambic poetry, which is a style peculiar to Cercidas, is a combination of the iambic and hexameter meters. His poems are filled with moralistic themes such as the uneven distribution of wealth and the unfortunate results of luxurious living.Clayman, D., (1980), Callimachus' Iambi, page 69. BRILL. There are seven poem fragments attributable to Cercidas. The longest fragment contains a discussion of the nature of the gods and of divine providence, in which Cercidas declares that the current beliefs do not square with the facts of life: > [why did God not] choose that greedy cormorant wealthpurse, > that sweet-scented out-of-control Xenon, make him a pathetic poor man, > and transfer to us who deserve it the silver that now > is uselessly flowing away? What can there be to prevent god - > supposing you asked him the question - since a god, > whatever comes into his mind, can easily get it all done, > if a man is a turd of a loan-shark, a real old die-for-a-penny > who squanders it all out again, one who's the death of his fortune, > why can't God just empty this man of his swinewealth, > and give to a thin-feeding, common-bowl cup-dipper > all the man's damned expenditure? Has the eye of Justice been mole- > blinded?Cercidas, fragment 2, quoted in: Graham Shipley, The Greek World > After Alexander, 323-30 B.C., page 184. Routledge. Cercidas goes on to explain that he would rather leave the gods to the astrologers, and worship the tried Paean, Giving, and Retribution, that is, beneficence for those afflicted in body or spirit and punishment for wrongdoers. Another poem is erotic, teaching the cheap and easy way of love. Another fragment, apparently biographical, expressing the poet's satisfaction that he has devoted himself to the service of the Muses all his life. In addition to these poems, there are also some papyrus fragments of a moral anthology with an introduction in choliambics, which can be dated to the 3rd century BC. It is possible that the anthology was compiled by Cercidas, but this is doubtful because the quality of the choliambic poetry in the introduction is much inferior to his meliambic poetry.A. D.

Career Cooke was born at Gomersal, West Riding of Yorkshire into a family of carpet manufacturers. As a child Cooke learned the piano and later the cello and was already composing by the age of 7 or 8. He was educated at Streete Preparatory School, Repton School and at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge, where he read History taking Part 1 of his Tripos in 1927 and gaining his B.A., but he changed to read music where his composition teacher was E. J. Dent.Wetherell, Eric. 'Cooke, Arnold (Atkinson)' in Grove Music Online, 2001 At Cambridge, Cooke continued to play the cello in the CUMS orchestra and in a string quartet. He was President of the Cambridge Musical Society from 1927 to 1928. In 1929, he gained his Music degree and went to Berlin where he studied composition and piano at the Berlin University of the Arts under Paul Hindemith. He later became Musical Director of the Festival Theatre at Cambridge, and in 1933 was appointed a professor at the Royal Manchester College of Music (now merged into the Royal Northern College of Music). He moved to London in 1938 to further his career.Talbot, John. Obituary in The Guardian, 26 August 2005 In the 1930s Cooke carved out a reputation for himself as a promising young composer, and his music was taken up by leading interpreters. The harpist Maria Korchinska introduced his Harp Quintet in 1932; Sir Henry Wood conducted his Concert Overture No.1 at the 1934 Promenade Concerts and the Griller Quartet premiered his String Quartet no. 1 in 1935. In 1936 Havergal Brian singled out for praise a cantata, Holderneth, a setting of a text by the American poet Edward Sweeney. Louis Kentner and the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Adrian Boult premiered his Piano Concerto in 1943, which he had completed just before his call-up in 1941. The concerto had been commissioned by the South African pianist Adolph Hallis in 1939 but the outbreak of WWII meant that Hallis had to return to South Africa so Kentner gave the first performance in a BBC studio broadcast on 11 November 1943. The work received subsequent broadcast performances from Franz Reizenstein with the BBC Northern Orchestra under Clarence Raybould in 1952 and Eric Parkin with the BBC Northern Orchestra under Brian Priestman in 1972. In the Second World War, he served in the Royal Navy, first in the aircraft carrier HMS Victorious and subsequently as a liaison officer in a Norwegian escort vessel and a Dutch tug that took part in the D-Day Landings. After demobilisation he returned to London in 1946, becoming a founder member of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain, and from 1947 until his retirement in 1978 he was Professor of Harmony and Composition at Trinity College of Music in London. In 1948, through the recommendation of E. J. Dent he obtained a doctorate from Cambridge submitting as his composition portfolio his Symphony no. 1 (1946‚Äì47), Piano Concerto (1939-40) and Sonata for viola and piano (1936‚Äì37). After a stroke in 1993 he virtually ceased to compose, but lived to the age of 98 dying at his nursing home in Five Oak Green in Kent. Four of his symphonies and other orchestral works have been issued on the Lyrita label, whilst the Clarinet Quintet and the Clarinet Concerto No. 1 were recorded on Hyperion. MPR Records has embarked on a series of chamber music recordings.Mike Purton Recording Music As a composer Cooke was highly productive and tended to work in traditional genres. He wrote two operas ‚Äì Mary Barton (completed 1954) after the novel by Mrs. Gaskell and The Invisible Duke (1976). The ballet Jabez and the Devil (1961) was a commission from the Royal Ballet. He composed six symphonies, several concertos, copious chamber music including a clarinet quintet and five string quartets, many instrumental sonatas, and some important vocal music. His music seems to show the influence of Hindemith almost throughout his career, leavened with a more English sense of lyricism.

Marcelonis was known in the Philadelphia arts community as a songwriter, playwright and founder of several improvisational comedy groups. Naturally gifted and raised in a religious family, Bob had composed Masses, Ave Maria's and commemorative pieces for the canonization of Saint John Neumann. He sang in the choir of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. As well as playing various instruments, composing and orchestrating, Bob had an incredible voice and a natural singing ability. He graduated from Temple University's School of Music in May 1975, as a music composition major. He was interested in of all types of music and cultures, which would often influence his musical compositions. Though classically trained, he participated in the folk festival every year. And as well as masses, wrote inane lyrics and silly songs, always happy to make people laugh or to laugh himself. As is often the case with artists, Marcelonis had to find work outside of the arts in order to make ends meet. He became an accomplished computer systems analyst in a matter of months through self-study and was able to maintain a comfortable lifestyle through this work. During the late-1970s and early-1980s Marcelonis wrote scores of songs and played the local coffeehouse circuit both as a solo act and with his band, Melisma. He lived for several years during the late-1970s and early-1980s in Los Angeles where he worked with \\"The Groundlings\\" learning the craft of improvisational comedy. His mother was diagnosed with cancer just as Bob was starting to break through in both his musical and comedic talents. He returned home to Germantown, in Philadelphia, to care for his mother until she died. He remained in the home where he grew up never returning to California. Upon returning home to Philadelphia he soon started his own series of improv groups. Some of the descendants of these groups are still performing in Philadelphia and other areas, to this day. He was thought of by many as a \\"catalyst\\"; bringing creative people together and initiating the creative process in music, comedy and various artistic media. Bob wrote a lot of comedy and could find humor in all of life. Bob used to justify his wit with his famous phrase: \\"Didja laugh?? Well, then!!\\" Always, with a smile, a joke, a song -- Bob was a man of many talents and a very simplistic, uncomplicated life view. In the early-1990s, Bob's life would change drastically when he learned he was HIV positive. Bob fought hard for his life but came to accept his pending death as certain, as his illness would infiltrate his body and he would get AIDS, suffering greatly. At first he feared admitting his illness and losing his family and friends. But in the end, pure love overcame fear and as he told each of his family and friends, all embraced him and all were with him to the very end. Bob used his illness as inspiration and motivation to complete his vision of two plays. One, Fables, based on Aesop's fables, was a continual work in progress from High School until he was forty. His artist friends came together and performed the play to standing room only audiences, sold out for its run. Aids now had the upper hand on Bob but he had desire to complete one more play, Copernicus, an ironic twist since Nicolaus Copernicus the astronomer had leprosy, the AIDS of 15th century. He wrote constantly, as he could feel himself getting weaker. It may be that his need to write the play, compose the music and the scores, is what got him through the ever darkening days of his health. His music's inspiration and aware of his time limitations, Bob made this not only a mission but his final work. Copernicus was a masterpiece of all his talents, music, composition, writing, comedy, love, life and death. Bob paralleled the story to living with AIDS and used his play as a project for an AIDS fundraiser, \\"The Copernicus Project.\\" Artists came from all over the world to mount this play. The hand sewn costumes were brilliant, a gift from Catherine Jansen, a well-respected mixed media artist shown in many galleries. Opera singers came from all over the globe to give Bob's play the best it could have. As he was writing the play his illness progressed. He lost vision in one eye and suffered terrible pain in his body. But love and passion kept his fire ever burning and he worked night and day on Copernicus, his gift to us, his love story. He once said to a friend: :\\"I am sick with a deadly disease, I am weak and dying, this I know. But I also know that I am very blessed to be loved unconditionally, no matter what. And you know what? Right now, with my play being produced and all my friends and family here and to be so loved...even with AIDS, knowing I am dying, I wouldn't trade places with anyone at this moment!\\" And he would not have. A man of great ability and the capacity to love and to be loved. He never had an agenda, just a passion for life, laughter and music. Marcelonis died in his home in the Germantown section of Philadelphia in March 1995 after a prolonged struggle with AIDS.

Biography Aufrecht was born into a Jewish familyShlomo Berger, Speaking Jewish - Jewish Speak: Multilingualism in Western Ashkenazic Culture, Peeters Publishers (2003), p. 254 in Leschnitz, Prussian Silesia, and was educated at Humboldt-Universit√§t in Berlin, graduating in 1847, in which year he also published a treatise on Sanskrit accent (De Accentu Sancritico, Bonn, 1847), originally his dissertation. With Kirchhoff, he collaborated in the publication of Die umbrischen Denkm√§ler (Umbrian memorials, 1849‚Äì51). With Adalbert Kuhn, he founded the Zeitschrift f√ºr vergleichende Sprachforschung (1852). In 1852 he moved to Oxford to assist Friedrich Max Muller in preparation of his edition of Rigveda with SƒÅya·πáa's commentary. He studied at the Bodleian Library and prepared a catalogue of its collection of Sanskrit manuscripts (Catalogi codicum manuscriptorum bibl. Bodleianae P. VIII. codices Sanscriticos complectens, 1859‚Äì64). From 1862 until 1875, he was professor at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, where he occupied the newly established chair of Sanskrit and comparative philology. There, in 1875, he was granted the degree of LL.D. In 1875 Aufrecht was appointed to the chair of indology at the University of Bonn, and remained at that post until 1889. Between 1891 and 1903, he published a three volume alphabetical catalogue of all Sanskrit manuscript collections known at the time, in a work titled, Catalogus Catalogorum. This was the first such attempt to catalogue all Indian manuscripts, built on Aufrecht's previous catalogues of Sanskrit manuscripts of libraries of Trinity College, Cambridge (1869), Florence (1892), Leipzig (1901), and M√ºnchen (1909). Beginning in 1935, the University of Madras began working on an updated catalogue called the New Catalogus Catalogorum, a work that is still in progress. Aufrecht died in Bonn.

It is native to Amur Oblast and Primorye in Russia, Manchuria in China, and the Korean Peninsula. Like other hedgehogs, it uses scent and hearing while looking for prey, and the name \\"hedgehog\\" refers to the pig-like grunts it makes as it forages. Description This hedgehog is closely related to and slightly larger and lighter in color than the European hedgehog, with a head-and-body length of between and a very short tail. It weighs between . The head, back and sides are covered with long, sharp spines. These are of two different colours; some are plain white; others have a white or yellowish-brown base and tip, and a central portion that is mid to dark brown, giving the animal an altogether pale, brownish-grey colour. The quills on the head are separated from each other by narrow strips of bare skin. The quills, covered in keratin, are strong so that they don't break or fall out. These spines are used as a defense mechanism when they are threatened. The hedgehog curls up into a ball, where their quills are facing out and their face/head are curled inwards. The face and underparts are covered in pale hair. Distribution and habitat The Amur hedgehog is found natively in the Amur Oblast and Primorye in Russia, Manchuria in China, and the Korean Peninsula. Its range extends from about 29¬∞N, which is just south of the Yangtze River northwards to the Amur Basin and the Korean Peninsula. It occupies a wide range of habitats including grassland, forest edges, and areas with mixed coniferous and broadleaf woodland. The IUCN Red List states that it is found in valleys and lowlands but not in highland regions or cultivated fields. The Mammals of China disagrees, stating that suitable habitats include montane and sub-alpine terrain, steppe, shrublands, cultivated land, villages and city parks. Reproduction The Amur hedgehog is an animal that can survive on its own without any partnership. These animals typically only come together when it is mating season. There is no information regarding this specific species reproduction to this date. Ecology Like other hedgehogs, this is a nocturnal species, emerging at night to forage for small arthropods, especially fly larvae, and earthworms, centipedes, snails, mice, frogs and occasionally fruit. Chinese sources state that this hedgehog is preyed on by sable (Martes zibellina), but Russian sources dispute this. There are one or two litters in the summer, each consisting of four to six young, and in about October, the hedgehog enters a state of torpor and hibernates until spring. Status E. amurensis is a common species and no specific threats have been identified, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". These hedgehogs, though common, have a lifespan of 8 years, while in captivity. It is unknown how long they live in native lands.

In 1934 she was the first to mention the idea later named nuclear fission. With her husband - Walter Noddack - and Otto Berg she discovered element 75, rhenium. She was nominated three times for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.Noddack was also awarded the German Chemical Society's prestigious Liebig Medal in 1931 along with her husband. In 1934, they received the Scheele Medal of the Swedish Chemical Society and in the same year they secured yet another German patent, for rhenium concentrate. Background Ida Tacke was born in Lackhausen (nowadays a part of the city of Wesel) in the northern Rhine region in 1896. She described how she picked her path of study by stating, \\"since I did not want to be a teacher at all, and research and industry employed proportionally fewer physicists at that time, I decided to become a chemist‚Äì a decision that was welcomed by my father who owned a small varnish factory in the Lower Rhine region.\\"Annette Lykknes, Donald L. Opitz, and Brigitte Van Tiggelen, eds., For Better or for Worse? Collaborative Couples in Science (n.p.: Springer Basel, 2012), 105. She chose to attend the Technical University of Berlin because she was drawn to the long and demanding programs. She entered the school in 1915 six years after women were allowed to study in all of Berlin's universities. Nine out of the eighty- five members of her class studied chemistry.Lykknes, Opitz, and Van Tiggelen, For Better, 105 In 1918, she graduated from the University with a degree in chemical and metallurgical engineering, specifically on higher aliphatic fatty acid anhydrides.Gildo Magalh√§es Santos, \\"A tale of oblivion: Ida Noddack and the 'universal abundance' of matter\\", Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 68 (2014): 374. She was one of the first women in Germany to study chemistry and she was a part of one of the first generations of female students in Germany. In addition, the percent of women studying chemistry increased from 3% before World War I to 35% during the war. After graduating, she worked in the chemistry laboratory of the Berlin turbine factory of AEG, which is a company that is affiliated to General Electric in the United States. The building she worked in, designed by Peter Behrens, was world- famous and resembled a turbine. She met her husband, Walter Noddack, at the Technical University of Berlin while he was working as a researcher. They were married in 1926. Both before and after their marriage they worked as partners, an \\"Arbeitsgemeinschaft\\" or \\"work unit.\\" Nuclear fission Noddack correctly criticized Enrico Fermi's chemical proofs in his 1934 neutron bombardment experiments, from which he postulated that transuranic elements might have been produced. This theory was widely accepted for a few years. However, Noddack's paper \\"On Element 93\\" suggested a number of possibilities, but centered on Fermi's failure to chemically eliminate all lighter than uranium elements in his proofs, rather than only down to lead.Noddack, Ida (1934). √úber das Element 93. Angewandte Chemie. 47(37): 653-655. (On Element 93). The paper is considered historically significant today not simply because she correctly pointed out the flaw in Fermi's chemical proof but because she suggested the possibility that \\"it is conceivable that the nucleus breaks up into several large fragments, which would of course be isotopes of known elements but would not be neighbors of the irradiated element.\\"B. Fernandez and Georges Ripka, Unravelling the Mystery of the Atomic Nucleus: A Sixty Year Journey 1896-1956 (New York, NY: Springer, 2013), 352, Google Books. In doing so she presaged what would become known a few years later as nuclear fission. However, Noddack's theory did not exhibit experimental proof or theoretical basis for this possibility. Therefore, the paper was generally ignored and mocked by others, despite the fact that she was correct.Miriam Grobman, \\"Ida and the Atom, 1934\\", Medium, last modified March 9, 2016, accessed May 15, 2018. Several German scientists, like Otto Hahn, saw Noddack's work as \\"ridiculous.\\" A woman's position in the workplace had been dwindling for years due to the 1929 Wall Street crash. In 1932, a German law, replicating others in Europe, was put into place that obligated married women to leave their jobs and become housewives so that there would be more positions available for men. Noddack was able to escape this law due to her status as an \\"unpaid collaborator.\\" This may have caused her to be looked down upon by men in the field as she was only able to work due to this loophole. Noddack's idea of nuclear fission was not confirmed until much later. Experiments along a similar line to Fermi's, by Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie, Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie and Pavle Saviƒá in 1938 raised what they called \\"interpretational difficulties\\" when the supposed transuranics exhibited the properties of rare earths rather than those of adjacent elements. Ultimately on December 17, 1938, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann provided chemical proof that the previously presumed transuranic elements were isotopes of barium, and Hahn wrote these exciting results to his exiled colleague Lise Meitner, explaining the process as a 'bursting' of the uranium nucleus into lighter elements. Meitner and Otto Frisch utilized Fritz Kalckar and Niels Bohr's liquid drop hypothesis (first proposed by George Gamow in 1935) to provide a first theoretical model and mathematical proof of what Frisch coined nuclear fission. Frisch also experimentally verified the fission reaction by means of a cloud chamber, confirming the energy release. Therefore, Noddack's original hypothesis was finally accepted. Translation in American Journal of Physics, January 1964, p. 9-15 Element discovery Noddack and her husband-to-be looked for the then still unknown elements 43 and 75 at the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt. In 1925, they published a paper (Zwei neue Elemente der Mangangruppe, Chemischer Teil) and called the new elements rhenium (75) and masurium (43). They named the elements rhenium in respect of Ida's birthplace, and masurium in honor of his. After of scientists were sceptical of their results, the Noddack's began to perform more experiments to confirm their discoveries. Only that of rhenium was confirmed. They were unable to isolate element 43 and their results were not reproducible. These achievements led to Ida being awarded the German Chemical Society's prestigious Liebig Medal in 1931. Element 43 was definitively isolated in 1937 by Emilio Segr√® and Carlo Perrier from a discarded piece of molybdenum foil from a cyclotron which had undergone beta decay. It was eventually named technetium due to its artificial source. No isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2 million years and was presumed to have disappeared on Earth as a naturally occurring element. In 1961 minute amounts of technetium in pitchblende produced from spontaneous 238U fission were discovered by B. T. Kenna and Paul K. Kuroda. Based on this discovery, Belgian physicist Pieter van Assche constructed an analysis of their data to show that the detection limit of Noddacks' analytical method could have been 1000 times lower than the 10‚àí9 value reported in their paper, in order to show the Noddacks could have been the first to find measurable amounts of element 43, as the ores they had analyzed contained uranium.By reanalysing the original experimental conditions, we conclude that the detection limit for their observing the X-rays of Z = 43 can be 1000 times lower than the 10‚àí9 detection limit for the element Z = 75. Using Van Assche's estimates of the Noddacks' residue compositions, NIST scientist John T. Armstrong, simulated the original X-ray spectrum with a computer, and claimed that the results were \\"surprisingly close to their published spectrum!\\"\\"I simulated the X-ray spectra that would be expected for Van Assche's initial estimates of the Noddacks' residue compositions. ...Over the next couple of years, we refined our reconstruction of their analytical methods and performed more sophisticated simulations. The agreement between simulated and reported spectra improved further. \\" Gunter Herrmann from the University of Mainz examined van Assche's arguments, and concluded they were developed ad hoc, and forced to a predetermined result. According to Kenna and Kuroda 99technetium content expected in a typical pitchblende (50% uranium) is about 10 ‚àí10 g/kg of ore. F. Habashi pointed out that uranium was never more than about 5% in Noddacks' columbite samples, and the amount of element 43 could not exceed 3 √ó 10 ‚àí11 ¬µg/kg of ore. Such a low quantity could not be weighed, nor give X-ray lines of element 43 clearly distinguishable from the background noise. The only way to detect its presence was to carry out radioactive measurements, a technique the Noddacks were not able to employ, but Segr√® and Perrier did.Abstract: A careful study of the history of the element 43 covering a period of 63 years since 1925 reveals that there is no reason for believing the Noddacks and Berg have discovered element 43. ... P. H. Van Assche and J. T. Armstrong, cannot stand up to the well-documented assertion of the well-established physicist Paul K. Kuroda (1917 2001) in his paper, \\"A Note on the Discovery of Technetium\\" that the Noddacks did not discover technetium, then known as masurium. More about this matter can be found in Kuroda's book, The Origin of Chemical Elements and the Oklo Phenomenon, and the book Ida Noddack (1896 1978). Personal Recollections on the Occasion of 80th Anniversary of the Discovery of Rhenium recently published by the writer...Fathi Habashi *Since the publication in this Journal of my paper on the discovery of element 43 (1), I have received a few letters questioning the correctness of the next to last paragraph, in the section entitled Nemesis.... I am deeply indebted to George B. Kauffman, Fathi Habashi, Gunter Herrmann, and Jean Pierre Adloff, who provided me with additional information and convinced me to better consider the published material on the so-called Noddacks' rehabilitation and to correct with this letter my gross mistake, for which I apologize. Roberto Zingales #Zingales, R. J. Chem. Educ. 2005, 82, 221227 Following on the van Assche and Armstrong claims, an investigation was made into the works of Masataka Ogawa who had made a prior claim to the Noddacks. In 1908 he claimed to have isolated element 43, calling it Nipponium. Using an original plate (not a simulation), Kenji Yoshihara determined Ogawa had not found the Period 5 Group 7 element 43 (eka-manganese), but had successfully separated Period 6 Group 7 element 75 (dvi-manganese) (rhenium), preceding the Noddacks by 17 years.Masataka Ogawa's discovery of nipponium was accepted once in the periodic table of chemical elements as the element 43, but disappeared later. However, nipponium clearly shows characteristics of rhenium (Z=75) by inspection of his papers from the modern chemical viewpoints...a record of X-ray spectrum of Ogawa's nipponium sample from thorianite was contained in a photographic plate reserved by his family. The spectrum was read and indicated the absence of the element 43 and the presence of the element 75In a recent evaluation of the discovery of \\"nipponium,\\" supposed to be element 43 by Masataka Ogawa in 1908, and confirmed but not published by his son Eijiro in the 1940s, Kenji Yoshihara remeasured a photographic plate of an X-ray spectrum taken by Ogawa and found the spectral lines were those of rhenium. Thus actually, rhenium was discovered many years before Noddack, Tacke, and Berg's work.Element 75 was isolated in 1908 by the Japanese chemist Masataka Ogawa and named nipponium. He inadequately assigned it as element 43 (technetium). From the modern chemical viewpoint it has to be considered to be element 75. Notable nominations and awards Ida Noddack was nominated three times for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry due to her discovery of rhenium and masurium. Noddack and her husband were repeatedly nominated for the Nobel Prize in 1932, 1933, 1935 and 1937 (once by Walther Nernst and K. L. Wagner for 1933; both Noddacks were nominated by W. J. M√ºller for 1935 and by A. Skrabal for 1937). The two of them were also awarded the German Chemical Society's prestigious Liebig Medal in 1931. In 1934, they received the Scheele Medal of the Swedish Chemical Society as well as the German patent for rhenium concentrate. Bibliography *Tacke, Ida, and D.

The song and lyrics apparently referred to one of Jackson's male lovers. The song was remembered as being prominent in Jackson's repertory before he left New Orleans in 1912, but was not published until 1916. The background as to how the song came to be published has been confused over the years but the truth appears to be that composer Egbert Van Alstyne and lyricist Gus Kahn were writing partners and whilst Egbert was Chicago manager of music publishers, Jerome H. Remick & Company, they heard Tony Jackson singing the song one evening at a Chicago nightspot. They liked the melody but the lyrics were unsuitable for mass consumption. So Jackson was paid $250 for the rights to the tune and Kahn re-wrote the lyrics with Van Alstyne adding a verse, which he took from one of his earlier songs which had not been successful. Jackson's name was included on the sheet music. The song was quickly interpolated into the Broadway show \\"A World of Pleasure\\" (Oct 14, 1915 - Jan 22, 1916) and was then used in the show The Passing Show of 1916 (Jun 22, 1916 - Oct 21, 1916) where it was sung by Dolly Hackett. In London, the song was included in the musical Houp La! which opened on 23 November 1916 and it was sung by Gertie Millar. Billy Murray recorded the song on June 22, 1916 for Victor Records (catalog 18102) and it was a huge hit.

Lyrics Here is the way early recording star Billy Murray covered it in 1916: Verse 1 :You ask me why I'm always teasing you. :You hate to have me call you \\"Pretty Baby.\\" :I really thought that I was pleasing you, :For you're just a baby to me. :Your cunning little dimples and your baby stare, :Your baby talk and baby walk and curly hair, :Your baby smile :Makes life worthwhile. :You're just as sweet as you can be. Verse 2 :Your mother said you were the cutest kid. :No wonder, Dearie, that I'm wild about you :And all the cunning things you said and did. :Why, I love to fondly recall. :And just like Peter Pan it seems you'll always be :The same sweet cunning little baby dear to me, :And that is why :I'm sure that I :Will always love you best of all. Chorus :Everybody loves a baby that's why I'm in love with you, :Pretty baby, pretty baby, :And I'd like to be your sister, brother, dad and mother too, :Pretty baby, pretty baby. :Won't you come and let me rock you in my cradle of love :And we'll cuddle all the time. :Oh, I want a lovin' baby, and it might as well be you, :Pretty baby of mine, :Pretty baby of mine.

The main block of the Parliament Buildings combines Baroque details with Romanesque Revival rustication The legislative chamber inside the Parliament Building Construction of a new Parliament Building was first authorized by an act of the provincial legislature in 1893, the Parliament Buildings Construction Act. The province, anxious to commemorate its growing economic, social and political status, was engaged in an architectural competition to build a new legislative building in Victoria, after outgrowing \\"The Birdcages\\", which were notoriously drafty and leaked in wet weather. Francis Rattenbury, a recent English immigrant, 25 years old, entered the contest and signed his drawings with the pseudonym \\"A B.C. Architect\\". He progressed to the second round, signing his drawing \\"For Queen and Province\\" and eventually won the competition.

The andesite of the British Columbia Parliament Buildings is from Haddington Island in the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt.Natural Landscape Stones - Bedrock Granite Sales, Andesite, Basalt, Rhyolite, Sandstone - Vancouver, BC, Canada The granite used to build the buildings came from Nelson Island, at the mouth of Jervis Inlet, on the Sunshine Coast. Besides the elected Members of the Legislative Assembly, two organizations have been granted the privilege of using the Legislative Chambers during the legislature's December recess: the British Columbia Youth Parliament (since 1924, except during its sessions of the late 1940s and early 1950s) and the British Columbia Universities' Model Parliament. Statue of Chief Maquinna by Charles Marega During the 1994 Commonwealth Games, free music concerts were held on the front lawns of the buildings, attracting as many as 40,000 people. Similar-sized crowds have gathered on the front lawn over the years, ranging from political protests and rallies, such as during the Solidarity Crisis of 1983, to celebrations of various kinds, including the BC 150 ceremonies.  Exterior sculpture program  The sculpture on the buildings was designed by the provincial librarian, E.O.S. Scholefield and executed by Charles Marega and his assistant Bernard Carrier. For the exterior of the library Marega created 14 figures: Chief Maquinna, Captain George Vancouver, Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie, Dr. John McLoughlin, Hon. John Sebastian Helmcken, Captain James Cook, Sir James Douglas, Sir Francis Drake, Sir Alexander McKenzie, Simon Fraser, Lord Lytton, Sir Anthony Musgrave, David Thompson, and Col. R.C. Moody. Carrier produced twelve figures of women, all allegorical, three around each of the building's four domes.Segger, Martin, ed. The British Columbia Parliament Buildings, Arcon, Vancouver, 1979, pp. 66‚Äì67  Mural controversy  The rotunda of the British Columbia Parliament Building In 1932, artist George Southwell was commissioned to paint murals in the rotunda depicting scenes from British Columbia history from 1792 to 1843. The work was completed three years later. Decades later, controversy arose over the depiction of west coast aboriginal people in the murals, which in modern times is now regarded as degrading. One mural, entitled Labour, portrays bare-breasted aboriginal women hauling timber while a white man watches. In another entitled Justice, an aboriginal chief is shown standing before a judge (said to be Matthew Baillie Begbie), suggesting the subjugation of natives to colonial law. However, Southwell's daughter claimed that her father depicted the chief as standing before another judge, one who championed native rights. A 2001 report, commissioned by the New Democrat government of the day, recommended that the murals be relocated to a museum where they could be given historical perspective.Peter Seixas and Penney Clark, \\"Obsolete Icons and the Teaching of History,\\" New Possibilities for the Past: Shaping History Education in Canada, ed. Penney Clark (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2011), 284. However, as the murals are painted on to the walls of the rotunda, the cost of removing them was estimated at $280,000. In April 2007, the legislature voted to remove murals, with only 3 of the 71 members voting against the motion.murals in the legislature Since that vote, the murals have been fully restored and hidden from public view behind false walls.

Mel was introduced by executive producer Matthew Robinson and made her first appearance on 19 October 1998. Outhwaite made her departure on 12 April 2002. Outhwaite's return to the series was announced in October 2017 and she returned on 9 January 2018. The actress chose to leave the soap again in July 2019 and her final episode aired on 14 November 2019 when her character was killed off. Outhwaite proved popular in the role, winning multiple awards and critical acclaim for her portrayal of Mel as the character became prominent in the show. During her original tenure in the soap, Mel was featured in high-profile storylines, such as a wedding to local businessman Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) to mark the Millennium Eve celebrations on New Year's Eve 1999; a problematic and dangerous marriage to criminal Steve Owen (Martin Kemp); a one-night stand with Steve's nemesis Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden); and a close friendship with Phil's estranged girlfriend Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin). Writers also placed Mel at the centre of a storyline marking the show's increase to four weekly episodes in 2001, when she is kidnapped by her ex-lover Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) after Steve and Phil conspired to frame him for the latter's shooting. Throughout her time on the show, especially since her 2018 return, when Mel became more of a villain, she has become somewhat more \\"wicked\\" and has a harder edge, when compared to her early appearances. In her second stint on the show, Mel was included in storylines such as working for crime boss Ciara Maguire (Denise McCormack); colluding with Phil against Ciara's ex- husband Aidan (Patrick Bergin); a relationship with Phil's love rival Jack Branning (Scott Maslen); an engagement and marriage with former policeman Ray Kelly (Sean Mahon); covering up Ray's murder after he was shot dead by her son Hunter (Charlie Winter) for attempting to kill her; and trying to stop Hunter from going to prison and later harboring him when he escapes, which culminates with Hunter being shot dead by the police after he held her hostage and nearly shot Phil and Lisa's daughter Louise (Tilly Keeper) after shooting her brother Ben (Max Bowden). Following Hunter's death, Mel developed a feud with Phil's wife Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) and blackmailed her after learning of her affair with Louise's boyfriend Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters). This concludes with Mel being involved in a high-speed car chase with Sharon upon attempting to expose her affair with Keanu to Phil, only to end up subjugated to a vehicle collision that results in Sharon rescuing Mel, before Mel is then killed after walking into an incoming lorry. Storylines =1998‚Äì2002= Mel Healy had a troubled past: she owned a business that went bankrupt, was abused by a boyfriend, and was estranged from her family for some years - traveling around the Greek Islands before ultimately reuniting with her brother, vicar Alex Healy (Richard Driscoll), and their father Jeff (Leslie Schofield) in Walford from October 1998. When she first arrived in the square, Mel started working for local businessman Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). They soon begin dating and Ian later requests Mel to help with his children; Mel finds the children hard to deal with at first but grows to love them. Ian and Mel plan to marry, but Mel gets cold feet ‚Äì realising she doesn't truly love Ian. When Ian discovers this, he claims that his daughter Lucy (Casey Anne Rothery) is dying of cancer in a desperate bid to retain his romantic bond with Mel; she gives in and later agrees to marry him. The pair marry on New Year's Eve 1999, in a double wedding with fellow neighbors Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson) and Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed). At their reception, however, Mel discovers a letter that Ian threw away ‚Äì which officially gave Lucy the all-clear; she confronts Ian and, after he admits to lying about his daughter's health, dumps him just as the clock strikes midnight and the new millennium begins. After divorcing Ian and the exposure of his fabrication about Lucy's health, Mel starts a relationship with local publican Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). However, this ends when Mel learns from her best-friend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin) that Dan reported her boyfriend Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) reported him to the police about his motor scam. When Mel causes Phil to learn about what Dan did and gets revenge, Dan vows to get payback on Mel and starts harassing her - until her love interest, Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), comes to her rescue. Soon afterwards, Mel and Steve start a relationship after he forces Phil's cousin Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) to help build her trust on him. They soon marry at the start of March 2001, despite Steve learning that Mel slept with Phil in a one-night stand on Christmas Night 2000. Just as Steve and Mel commence their honeymoon, Phil gets shot by a mystery assailant (see \\"Who Shot Phil?\\") and Steve is the prime suspect. Mel suspects it is him but he protests his innocence. Phil recovers from the shooting and confronts the culprit: Lisa. Steve forgives Mel and on Phil's instruction, he decides to frame Dan for the crime. Dan is wrongly imprisoned for Phil's attempted murder, and after his release, believing that it was Steve who actually shot him, kidnaps Mel in revenge. Dan demands a large sum of money and Steve grows desperate. During her few days of captivity, Dan tells Mel about Steve's dodgy dealings and criminal activities. Phil comes to her rescue and Dan flees. Mel takes time out after burning down her and Steve's club, E20, as revenge for Steve's lies. She briefly dates Barry's half-brother Nathan Williams (Doug Allen), but later reconciles with Steve after he manages to woo her back into their marriage. However, when Steve's feud with Phil sparks out of control, he proposes to Mel that they start anew and plan to emigrate to America with Lisa, her boyfriend Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and Lisa's daughter, Louise Mitchell (Rachel Cox). However, Mark can't go having been denied a Visa due to his HIV and Lisa is torn as to what to do, the plan is falling apart but Steve absconds with Louise but Phil follows them and a car chase ensues; Steve swerves and crashes. Phil rescues Louise and is about to go back for Steve but is too late ‚Äì the car explodes with Steve still inside, killing him. Mel is heartbroken when Steve's web of deceit and lies are uncovered after his death. She discovers that Steve was having an affair with Phil's sister, Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf), and that Steve sold their club and house behind her back. On Lisa's wedding day to Mark, Mel is arrested for drug connections after she is implicated in Steve's drug smuggling; Mel had unwittingly signed Steve's paperwork, linking the drug smuggling back to her. Facing a long spell in prison, Phil bails her for ¬£30,000 when she discovers that she is pregnant with Steve's child. She then discovers that Lisa was responsible for shooting Phil and that both knew it was not Steve, despite her continued suspicions. Feeling betrayed by everyone, she toasts herself before going to Portugal so Phil loses the ¬£30,000. Later that year, Lisa and Louise join Mel in Portugal. =2018‚Äì2019= Mel returns to Walford as she is working for her sister-in- law, Ciara Maguire (Denise McCormack), to track down money and jewellery that was stolen from Ciara in a recent robbery that took place in the area, and Ciara is keeping Mel's son, Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter), from her until she finds the money. Mel eventually discovers that Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) has the money and Mel double-crosses her so the money is returned and Mel is able to see Hunter again. Ciara does not have the full amount, so in retaliation, she tells Hunter that Steve died in a car explosion, not a heart attack as Mel claimed and that he was a villain who killed Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor). Mel is forced to tell Hunter that Steve killed Saskia and that Steve framed Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom) and his death was a result of a car chase. Mel later compares Hunter to Steve and asks for them to start again. Mel decides to remain in Walford, accepting Sharon's offer to reopen the nightclub, which she agrees to name E20 in tribute to Steve to keep Hunter happy. Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) pursues Mel but Hunter sabotages Jack's car to prevent them going to France. Before the club's opening, Hunter finds out Phil was involved in Steve's death and Hunter blames Phil, so he has sex with Louise (now played by Tilly Keeper) in the office, knowing Phil will see it on CCTV. Phil is enraged and threatens to attack Hunter with a baseball bat but Mel seduces Phil and threatens to show Sharon the CCTV footage of their kiss to stop him from hurting Hunter. Mel and Jack argue after Mel tries to reunite Billy and Honey Mitchell (Emma Barton) by claiming that Billy has moved on. The argument leads to passion and Jack and Mel have sex. Ian decides he wants to marry Mel again and constantly tries to woo her, including offering Hunter a job at his restaurant. However, his efforts always go in vain. Jack later proposes to Mel, and just as she is about to accept, her ex- husband, Ray Kelly (Sean Mahon) turns up. It is revealed that Ray worked as an undercover cop and his relationship with Mel became strained due to his increasingly secretive behaviour, ultimately leading to their divorce. Mel confronts Ray at home, where her feelings for him resurface and she sleeps with him, causing Jack to break up with her. Although Ray insists that he will be there for her and Hunter and decides that he wants to remarry Mel, Mel becomes paranoid again and she frequently enlists Jack's help to gather more information about Ray. She finds out that Ray is a millionaire, much to her dismay. Furthermore, he goes by the alias, Simon. She is later stunned when she discovers that Ray is married to another woman called Maddie, and he has a son with her. She befriends Maddie, who thinks that Ray is Simon. Maddie, a fitness trainer, meets up with Mel to train her, but Mel reveals the truth about Ray. Mel and Maddie go to a house, where they think one of Ray's girlfriends lives. They pretend to be two police officers and are stunned when the woman turns out to be a teenager. It is revealed that the young woman they are talking to is Ray's daughter from yet another marriage. Mel and Maddie meet up with his third wife, Nicola, who is equally shocked at Ray's betrayal. Mel convinces Nicola and Maddie to join her in her plan to expose Ray on their wedding day, New Year's Day, 2019. They agree, but when the day arrives, Ray discovers Mel's scheme and strangles her with her wedding veil. Thinking he has murdered Mel, Ray stashes her body into a closet and arrives at the church. He is stunned when Mel turns up and declares that she still wants to go ahead with the wedding, in order to obtain Ray's money. Otherwise, she will show everyone her bruises that Ray inflicted. Ray and Mel get married, but just as they walk out of the church, Ray is confronted by Maddie and Nicola. Moments later, the police arrive and arrest Ray for bigamy. Ray escapes, later, Ray bundles an aggressive Hunter into the boot of his car, driving to Walford Common, where Mel appears knowing he has her son and confronts him with a gun. Following a heated discussion, Mel finally finds Hunter bound and gagged on the ground, then, Ray coming at them both with a shovel, they, panicking, quickly get into a car. Mel reverses into Ray and buries him, believing him to be dead; he grabs her leg and starts throttling her again. To stop him murdering his mother, Hunter shoots Ray, killing him. Hunter is arrested and Mel enters a lengthy legal battle to release her son from prison, though to no avail; he is imprisoned and Mel visits him. She becomes more reclusive and stressed without Hunter and tries to avenge Hunter's imprisonment by blaming Jack. Mel is informed by the police that Hunter will be transferred to a prison in the North of England for his safety, before being told that during a crash involving the prison van escorting him, he has escaped. Hunter eventually returns to Walford, and she conceals him in a derelict flat, where she tries to treat his wounds sustained in the crash. She plans to obtain fake passports and return to Portugal for a fresh start. When Hunter is healed, Mel smuggles him in the boot of her car and prepares to leave when Lisa returns, wanting Mel's help to smuggle Louise and her fianc√©, Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters), out of the country; they agree for the five of them to move to Portugal. Mel learns that Hunter has escaped the car and taken her gun, Mel becomes panicked and tries to find him. In her search, she tries Jack's house, since Hunter wanted revenge on him for his imprisonment, and finds Jack's partner, Denise Fox (Diane Parish), unconscious on the floor after Hunter attacks her. She alerts the paramedics and goes to find Jack in The Queen Vic; she sees landlady Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) escorting him to the barrel store and realises that Hunter has ordered Linda to bring him there. Mel then cajoles Hunter in handing her the gun and they try to sneak him out of the pub unseen. When he is spotted, Hunter holds the pub hostage and shoots Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden); Mel tries to talk to him with no success and he takes Louise (Tilly Keeper) hostage in Albert Square with armed police surrounding them. Hunter shoots Keanu and Mel urges him to stop his actions; Hunter threatens Louise's life; he is then shot dead by a police marksman and Mel cradles his body, devastated. In the following weeks, Mel struggles in the aftermath and criticises Lisa for complaining about Louise when she is still alive. By way of apology for Ben and Louise, Mel takes flowers to the Mitchell home, where she keenly spots Keanu's overreaction to Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) knocking a pregnant Sharon's stomach and, witnessing a secret conversation between Sharon and Keanu, she realises that Keanu is the father of Sharon's baby, not Phil. This follows Phil trying to disrupt Hunter's funeral and Sharon insulting Hunter during a row with Mel. Mel swears to Lisa, on Hunter's memory, vengeance against the Mitchells. She begins to blackmail Sharon with the knowledge of her baby's paternity. She asks for ¬£20,000 and a villa in Portugal, threatening Sharon by using her son Dennis (Bleu Landau) to get to her. Over the coming weeks, Mel heightens her blackmail towards Sharon, who persuades Louise and Keanu to move in with Mel and Lisa. Mel sends Sharon away to find her a villa in Portugal for the four of them. Mel sells the club to Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton) as well as getting Sharon to sell her share, which she eventually does. However, she tells Mel that she knows that Mel helped Hunter when he escaped prison, shocking her and leaving her unsettled. Mel continues getting closer to Louise's unborn baby, which frightens Lisa. Mel is upset when she finds out that Louise and Keanu do not want to move to Portugal but manages to manipulate Lisa and tells her that Sharon's unborn baby is not Phil's. Later, Mel looks at Hunter's old things and puts Louise's baby scan with it saying ‚ÄúGrandma Loves You‚Äù. Mel continues to get closer to Louise and buys her a Citro√´n C3 Aircross for her 18th birthday. At the pub, Mel is shocked when Louise calls Sharon ‚Äòher second mum‚Äô and Mel pretends to poison Dennis when Sharon tells her to get over Hunter‚Äôs death. Mel plans a party for Louise‚Äôs 18th and Sharon‚Äôs 50th, hinting that she will reveal everything there. Lisa later confronts Mel about her getting close to Louise and Mel hits her. On the day of the party, Lisa suggests that Mel sees a therapist but Mel refuses, telling her she‚Äôs not mad like herself and tells Lisa it would‚Äôve been better if she had killed herself. Mel leaves a voicemail to Phil, who is away, telling him that Sharon has sold the business; he subsequently decides to return on the next flight. Unknown to Mel, Sharon is furious and tells Keanu they need a plan as they both rush to the club to confront Mel, only to walk into her party where Louise is already there. Mel gloats at Sharon and is confronted by Lisa in the office, who unknown to Mel, has planned something with Sharon. Mel threatens to phone Phil and tell him everything. An altercation takes place and Mel‚Äôs phone is smashed which results in both Mel and Sharon rushing to the airport to greet Phil first. Whilst driving, they encounter each other and Mel decides to phone Billy and tell him about Sharon and Keanu, telling him to put it on speaker and next to the microphone so that everyone at the party can hear, including Louise. However, she doesn‚Äôt manage to announce it to everyone as she crashes into a broken down car. Mel's car overturns as Sharon looks on and the partygoers, including Lisa, listen in, horrified. Mel, still alive, and semi conscious inside the wreckage, believes that she can hear Hunter's voice calling to her. Sharon manages to pull Mel from the wreckage before her car explodes, but Mel keeps hearing Hunter's voice in her head. After Sharon pleads with her to end the feud, Mel accuses her of stopping her from going 'back to Hunter' and paces towards the car, where she believes Hunter to be. As she stumbles towards the burning car, Sharon looks on in horror as a lorry appears through the smoke from the wreckage, hitting Mel and killing her instantly. Sharon, Louise and Lisa are left horrified. Lisa seeks revenge for Mel‚Äôs death by telling Phil he is not the father of Sharon‚Äôs baby. A few weeks later, Louise gives her daughter the middle name ‚ÄòMelanie‚Äô in honour of her. On Christmas Day, Mel‚Äôs meddling finally comes to fruition as Phil discovers Sharon‚Äôs affair and throws her out as well as orchestrating Keanu‚Äôs murder. Creation and development =Background and casting= Mel as she appeared in her initial stint. In 1998, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Matthew Robinson. Robinson was dubbed \\"the axeman\\" in the British press, after a large proportion of the EastEnders cast either quit, or were culled, shortly after Robinson's introduction. It was reported that Robinson hoped the changes would attract more viewers and \\"spice up [the soap's fictional setting of] Walford\\". To counteract the large number of departures, Robinson introduced several new characters, among them Melanie Healy played by Tamzin Outhwaite. In an interview with website Walfordweb, Matthew Robinson has stated that Melanie was \\"dreamt up to supplement the 'totty' contingent ‚Äì running thin at the time\\". Robinson stated that Tamzin Outhwaite was \\"a shoo-in ‚Äì and not just because of her beautiful blonde hair. Within a minute of her walking into auditions, hundreds already having trooped in and out of the door, I knew we had our star.\\" Outhwaite has stated that she was given the role without having to do a screen-test. Mel was brought into the serial as a member of the already established Healy family, joining her brother Reverend Alex Healy (Richard Driscoll) and father Jeff Healy (Leslie Schofield) in October 1998. Initially Mel's relationship with Alex and Jeff was not disclosed to viewers, and it was several weeks after her introduction that Mel actually came face- to-face with her brother on-screen; it was revealed that she had been estranged from them for some time. =Characterisation= Author Kate Lock has described Mel as free-spirited, exuberant, a beauty, wild-at-heart, and \\"a restless soul with a troubled past\\". In his assessment of the character, author Rupert Smith surmised Mel as \\"a nice girl with surprisingly bad taste in men.\\" Mel has been dubbed as a chameleon, and Outhwaite has suggested that she liked to bring variation to Mel's characterisation: \\"When I arrived I liked the idea Mel was feisty and strong. I didn't want her turning into a wimpy character like so many women in soaps. You know, they're either bitches or they're slags or they're victims. I wanted to give Mel a bit of everything. Every woman has all those elements to their character. It's just working out where they come and go, and I don't think that's lack of continuity; I think that's a three-dimensional character.\\" Outhwaite has suggested that the wardrobe department struggled to come up with a static identity for Melanie at first; however, this she felt turned out to be a good thing: \\"What I really liked about it was, when we started looking for costumes [for Mel], the wardrobe department couldn't quite fit where I was going. I'd wear Army pants and trainers some days and then jeans some other days and then I'd be all suited and booted at other times. I said, 'That's what girls do! That's how I am. Some days I'm in scruffs and some days I'm really dressed up. It would be really nice to have a character who's not so predictable.'\\" Rosalind Powell, head of the EastEnders' wardrobe design team in 2000, said that Mel had \\"colourful and stylish\\" wardrobe from retailers such as Kookai and Oasis. Powell added, \\"Although she's a barmaid, she can still afford to wear nice clothes, she just doesn't have a very big wardrobe.\\" =Relationships= Millennium Eve episodes An unlikely romance was scripted into Mel's narrative when she began dating her boss Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). The pairing has been described as one of \\"the most unbelievable soap couples\\", but Outwaite defended it in 1999, saying \\"I know I've fancied some not particularly attractive men in my time, but I don't think Ian is actually ugly. He has a vulnerable side and that's what is attractive. When he is being all hot-headed and gets above himself then I personally don't like Ian. But when he is being vulnerable I can see the attraction. People talk to me about it all the time. I have taxi drivers telling me I could do much better than Ian. The other day someone shouted that I should go back with [Mel's former fling] Steve Owen. It's incredible, they'd rather [Mel] went out with [Steve who is] a murderer than with [Ian, who is] a hard-working father raising three children.\\" Their relationship was the focus of the storyline that aired to mark the Millennium celebrations, when Ian emotionally blackmailed Mel into marrying him by claiming that his daughter was dying of cancer; storylines in the latter part of 1999 focused on the build-up to a joint Millennium wedding on New Year's Eve 1999 with Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson) and Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed). The wedding went as planned; however, Mel and Ian's marriage ended hours later as the clock struck midnight to signify the beginning of the New Year after Mel discovered Ian's lie. The Millennium Eve episodes drew in 20.89 million viewers ‚Äì the biggest soap audience since the character Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) was killed off in EastEnders precisely one year earlier (New Year's Eve 1998). An EastEnders spokeswoman commented: \\"This is a remarkable endorsement of the power of EastEnders that over 20 million viewers chose to see the Millennium celebrations in Albert Square.\\" The episodes were also broadcast on screens in London's Trafalgar Square, a typical ‚Äúhaunt for New Year's Eve revelers‚Äù. Relationship with Steve Owen A more long- running pairing was featured between Mel and the character Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was portrayed as a villain. It was an on/off romance beginning shortly after both characters' introduction in 1998. In an interview in June 2000, Kemp discussed the relationship between Steve and Mel: \\"Steve's convinced Mel will make his life complete. She kept him going during all the bad times and now he's determined to have her. It's true of a lot of guys who get into trouble, they hang their hat on one idea and that keeps them sane [...] there's a driving force that kept them going while they were [in prison]. And often that's a woman. You know from those tender moments when Mel came to visit Steve [in prison] that she was the thing that kept him going, and he won't stop til he gets her back.\\" Eventually the couple were shown to marry in the soap in March 2001, despite a revelation that Mel had strayed with Steve's nemesis Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Tamzin Outhwaite explained, \\"With Ian, Mel was the one who didn't want to go through with it. This time around Mel is the one who is apprehensive, hoping Steve will be there for her. If he isn't, she has no reason to stay in Walford. This really is make or break time for her.\\" The wedding night was a precursor to one of the soap's most publicised storylines, \\"Who Shot Phil?\\", where Phil was gunned down by an unknown assailant and, due to Mel's infidelity, Steve became one of the prime suspects for the murder attempt, though he transpired to be a red herring. Discussing Mel and Steve's wedding, Outhwaite said, \\"Even though this wedding with Steve has got as much controversy as Mel's last one [with Ian], it feels more true. The characters seem more suited and it's not a big, white wedding, it's a low-key register office thing.\\" 17 million viewers watched the wedding. In August 2001, EastEnders began airing a 4th weekly episode. The storyline to mark the occasion centred around Mel, her husband Steve, and her former lovers Phil and Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). After Phil and Steve wrongfully framed Dan for Phil's shooting, Dan sought revenge by kidnapping Mel and demanding a ransom. An EastEnders insider reportedly told The Mirror, \\"This has be [sic] one of the most dramatic storylines we have ever filmed. Dan has vowed to get even with Phil and Steve for framing him over the shooting. Kidnapping Mel kills two birds with one stone. Although Mel and Phil have had their differences, he still harbours feelings for her.\\" As part of the storyline, Outhwaite, as Mel, was tied up to a radiator in a council flat. Outhwaite commented, \\"They offered to untie my wrists between scenes, but I said no so I could feel what it was really like. My wrists were raw by the end of it and I was exhausted, but that was the challenge I wanted.\\" Although Mel was rescued, the events on the storyline had ramifications for Mel and Steve's marriage after Dan told Mel that Steve had been unfaithful. This led to the temporary screen exit of Outhwaite who had been permitted time off from filming to make another TV series. This was part of a lucrative deal that Outhwaite made with the BBC, where Outhwaite reportedly agreed to remain on EastEnders for a further year if she was allowed to film other TV shows. In the storyline, Mel ended her marriage with Steve and departed after torching his club, ignoring his sobbing and begging. According to Outhwaite, \\"Steve was a rat and fully deserved it.\\" Mel returned after two months away and began negotiating divorce, however the divorcing was brief as Steve was killed off in the serial in March 2002 after Kemp decided to leave. His death storyline centred upon his on-going feud with Phil. =Departure (2002)= Following Martin Kemp's decision to quit EastEnders, Outhwaite announced she was quitting the soap in the autumn of 2001, stating, \\"I'm not sure what was left for Mel to do after she had been kidnapped, been married twice, burnt down a club and slept with her best friend's husband [...] To be honest with you, Mel's role in EastEnders has come to a kind of natural end. I always said I'd go when I felt that the character had run her course, and I'm going to leave when my contract runs out next year [...] Martin and I are in very similar situations with our characters. We came in at a similar time, and now it looks like we'll leave at a similar time, too. Mel and Steve had some kind of aura, a chemistry, that was unique. I was really proud of it.\\" She added, \\"I'll always be indebted to EastEnders for providing me with a wonderful start to my career on television and the opportunity to play a character like Mel has been fabulous. I felt it was time to move on and try on a new coat ‚Äì new characters, new challenges.\\" EastEnders' executive producer John Yorke said of Outhwaite's departure, \\"Tamzin has created one of the most-loved characters and (with Martin Kemp) one half of the least best on-screen couple in EastEnders since the show started. She has been fantastic to work with and we wish her all the luck in her career.\\" Yorke added that the character would be welcome back any time. Mel's exit storyline was linked to Steve's death, and Outhwaite claimed that viewers would be gripped by the storyline right up until her own exit a few months after Steve's. She commented, \\"Mel is relived by Steve's death. Mel acts brave, but inside she is breaking. She is given a necklace of black pearls on the day Steve dies, She falsely Phil was involved in the death but can't prove it. He has been nothing but trouble for her and she won't try to build bridges now [...] Mel looks brave on the outside but inside she's cracking up.\\" In the on-screen events, Mel's anger turns to devastation when Phil informs her that Steve had been having sex with his sister Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf). After being arrested over Steve's money laundering and discovering she was pregnant with Steve's baby, Mel confronted everyone who had wronged her before leaving Walford. At the time, Outhwaite stated that her final scenes were the hardest that she'd ever filmed. Tony Stewart, critic for The Mirror suggested that Mel's exit in April 2002 was thrilling and described it as \\"a devastating story of betrayal and her ultimate revenge [as] one by one her friends desert her.\\" Stewart praised Mel's final scene with the following description: \\"When she faces her last exit at Victoria Coach Station, there is a glint in her eye as Mel looks at the destination board and speaks on her mobile. 'Pick a number for me,' she says. 'One to 20. Great. Thank you.' And with that she is gone... but never forgotten.\\" =Reintroduction (2018)= Outhwaite stated, after leaving the show, that she might return to the character if the time was right. In 2010 she commented that a return would be unlikely as the character did not have links in the current cast, and that, in any case, she had never been asked back, stating: \\"People always ask me, but I've never been asked! It looks like I'm turning it down on a yearly basis, but I'm not. They've never asked me! So they don't want me back for one and I don't have any family left on the show. There's nobody on the Square she knows, I don't even think any of Mel's friends are still in it... I could walk down the market and be an extra, I suppose! [...] She doesn't really know anyone apart from Ian Beale and Phil Mitchell. So unless she was coming back to see one of them...\\" On 24 October 2017, the show's producers announced that Mel would be returning to the serial in 2018. Outhwaite, who billed Mel as \\"a strong independent woman\\", returned to filming in November 2017. Yorke, who was appointed executive consultant in June 2017, asked Outhwaite to reprise the role. The actress felt privileged to be invited back to the show and called playing Mel again \\"perfect\\". Outhwaite billed Mel as \\"a strong independent woman\\" upon her return and believed there are \\"lots more stories to tell\\" with the character. She commented, \\"EastEnders is in my DNA and I always knew deep down that someday I would revisit Mel.\\" Yorke said he was \\"thrilled and flattered\\" to have Outhwaite reprise the role and looked forward to exploring her absence and \\"who Melanie Owen is now\\". He also promised an \\"incredible\\" storyline for Mel when she returns and said it would \\"awaken a lot of old ghosts, some great memories, and a whole new series of adventures too\\". On 22 December 2017, it was announced that Charlie Winter had been cast in the role of Hunter Owen, the son of Mel and Steve. Hunter returns alongside Mel. Mel returned on-screen in the closing moments of the episode broadcast on 9 January 2018. =Departure (2019)= In July 2019, it was announced that Outhwaite had opted to quit the role again, and Mel would depart during the year. The actress originally signed a year-long contract and planned to leave at its conclusion. However, she remained on the soap for an additional year before choosing to leave. Outhwaite explained that she wanted to pursue other roles after creating \\"good memories\\" of being in EastEnders again. Executive producer Jon Sen expressed his gratitude towards Outhwaite, who he dubbed an \\"incredible talent\\", for reprising the role, adding that she \\"[allowed] EastEnders fans the chance to see one of Walford's most popular characters take centre stage once more.\\" Producers created a storyline leading up to Mel‚Äôs departure, in that she became involved in the high-profile affair between characters Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) and Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) after Hunter's death. A feud between Sharon and Mel started in September 2019 and played out towards her departure. The feud has become popular by fans on social media such as Twitter. A trailer was released on 1 November 2019, further promoting the feud and a dramatic car chase between the pair, which mirrors the way Mel's husband, Steve, was indirectly killed by Sharon's husband, Phil in 2002. Mel was killed off on 14 November after a major stunt, involving Sharon. Reception BBC News claimed in 2000 that Tamzin Outhwaite was one of EastEnders' most popular stars and Mel was described as one of the most popular characters on the show. During her stint it was reported that the BBC offered to increase her salary various times to entice her to stay with EastEnders with suggestions that she was the highest- paid British soap star. She was awarded 'Sexiest Female' at the British Soap Awards for three years running and 'Best Newcomer' at the National TV Awards. Outhwaite has discussed her popularity: \\"When I came in as the vicar's sister, I had no idea Mel would be such a big character and the audience would take to her so quickly. I was surprised as I thought she was a bit plain and a flirt. But no matter what Mel does ‚Äì going out with Ian, Dan, Steve, Phil ‚Äì people still like her. Women wanted to be her mate and blokes wanted her as a girlfriend.\\" Outhwaite was reportedly told to tone down her performances as Mel in 2000, when her love scenes were branded \\"too realistic for family viewing.\\" Viewers were only shown a censored version of her love scene with Dan Sullivan. Tamzin stated, \\"I was told that this was to be a scene in which I really wanted Dan and that it should be full on but because it was before the watershed they thought it was too much.\\" The lead up to Mel and Ian's Millennium wedding included a hen/stag night celebration episode, which was filmed on-location in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The episode evoked criticism by the Broadcasting Standards Commission for its inclusion of \\"almost relentless drunken and promiscuous behaviour, sexual innuendo and drug-taking, before the watershed\\", which included Mel having to kiss various strangers. The BBC defended the episode, claiming that its content would have ‚Äúcome as no surprise to viewers‚Äù and adding that the depiction of this behaviour conformed to an EastEnders tradition ‚Äì that questionable conduct \\"only leads to further trouble...One character's quest for drugs led to embarrassment and nausea and a drinking binge led to the calling off of [Barry and Natalie‚Äôs] wedding while the prospects for [Mel and Ian's] became bleaker.\\" See also *List of EastEnders characters (1998) *List of soap opera villains References External links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1998 Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Female characters in television Category:Female villains Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping Category:Fictional domestic abuse victims Category:Fictional blackmailers Category:Beale family (EastEnders) Category:Fictional female businesspeople ","title":"Mel Owen"},{"id":"2523880","text":"The abb√© Jean-Marie Perrot, in Breton Yann Vari Perrot (3 September 1877 in Plouarzel, Finist√®re - 12 December 1943 in Scrignac), was a Breton priest, Breton independentist assassinated by the Communist resistance. He was the founder of the Breton Catholic movement Bleun-Brug.  Early life  Perrot was raised in a provincial Breton-speaking family. After studying at the Institut des Fr√®res des √âcoles in Guingamp in 1889, he expressed a desire to become a priest. He left to study humanities at the Pont-Croix Youth Seminary. He spent one year in Brest with the 19th infantry regiment, then enrolled in the Quimper Seminary. He became vicar of Saint-Vougay in 1904, where he undertook the patronage of Paotred Sant-Nouga, where he formed study circles, a choir, and a theatre troupe for the local youth. He is the uncle of Louis Lalouer. Activism for the Breton language Perrot founded Bleun-Brug (Heather Flower) in 1905, which soon absorbed the magazine Feiz ha Breiz (Faith and Brittany), which he edited after 1911. The aims of the organisation were: * to promote the Breton ideal in all three intellectual, political and economic arenas. * to contribute, as Catholics, to the return of Brittany to the full exercise of its traditional faith. He was named vicar of Saint- Th√©gonnec in March 1914. On the outbreak of war he was called up at Lesneven on 5 August but he asked to leave to volunteer for the Groupe des Brancardiers Divisionnaires. He was decorated after World War I. After 1910, he played an important role in the Emsav, the Breton nationalist movement. In 1920, he was named vicar of Plouguerneau. In 1922 Yves Floc'h, the future painter worked as his parson. Perrot patronised Michel Le Noblez and organised theatrical performances. Yves Floc'h painted the scenery for a play, and his gifts were noticed by the vicar. From 1932, Perrot's secretary was Herry Caouissin. Perrot wrote countless articles and plays expressing his ideology, most notably in Feiz ha Breiz. He was initially stationed in a conservative Saint- Vougay parish, but was transferred to the more leftist area of Scrignac in 1930 by the episcopal hierarchy, who disliked his political activities. On 8 July 1941 he became part of the group of writers who adopted a unified orthography of the Breton language. World War II With the outbreak of war, hostility towards Perrot in Scrignac grew, as he was suspected of pro-German sympathies. On 16 October 1939 telegraphic lines in the region of Huelgoat were cut. Perrot was accused by authorities of sabotage. The gendarmes searched his estate twice and interrogated him, but he was released as he had an alibi. However, one gendarme publicly accused him of cutting the wires, and Perrot accused the gendarme of defamation. Afterwards, an enquiry established that a military prisoner was responsible for cutting the wires. At the request of the colonel of the Gendarmie of Quimper, the abb√© dropped his accusation of defamation. During the war, he continued to produce Feiz ha Breiz. Braving the ban by Adolphe Duparc on celebrating nationalist anniversaries during the occupation, he organised the members of Bleun-Brug in Tr√©guier on the 29 and 30 August to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the death of Duke Jean V of Brittany. In October 1942, he was named a member of the Comit√© Consultatif de Bretagne (CCB), a non-elected council put in place by Regional Prefect Jean Qu√©nette to put forward proposals relating to Breton language and culture. In July 1941, Perrot took part in the German-sponsored effort to unify the writing of Breton. Perrot sympathised strongly with the collaborationist Breton National Party. When his parsonage was partly requisitioned by the Germans, Perrot was accused of assisting them. According to Henri Fr√©ville, on 7 August 1943 Perrot was questioned about the movements of members of Bagadou Stourm, Breton nationalist stormtroopers allied to the Nazis, who had stopped at Scrignac. He was hospitable toward the Bagadou Stourm Youth, who were most active around Finist√®re, where leaders such as Yann Goulet and L‚ÄôHaridon had been arrested by the French police but released by the Germans. Assassination On 12 December 1943 the abb√© was killed by Jean Th√©paut, a member of the French Communist Party following a series of denunciations of Perrot for alleged collaborationist activity. Exploitation of his memory After his death, the collaborator C√©lestin Lain√© recruited about sixty men whom he organised under the name Bezen Kadoudal. Ael P√©resse, second-in- command to La√Æn√©, suggested naming the group after Perrot, so it became Bezen Perrot instead. Legacy Abb√© Perrot was laid to rest at the chapel of Coat- Qu√©au, in Scrignac. His memory is often celebrated on Easter Monday. The role of abb√© Perrot has been the source of much controversy about \\"the Breton cause\\", notably between Ronan Caouissin and the director of the theatre troupe Ar Vro Bagan Unvaniez Koad Kev was a law association created to maintain the legacy of abb√© Perrot. Since 1957, the association has been administered principally by Youenn Craff. Tepod Gwilhmod was president from 2001 to 2003. In 2005, a crisis arose over an attempted takeover by G√©rard Hirel (French police officer, ex-member of the French far right party \\"National Front\\"), Roland de la Morini√®re, and Loig Kervoaz, all members of Adsav. The current president and chaplain are Yann Sanseau and abbot Blanchard.

The term is derived from the name of the organization \\"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\\" (SBVT, later the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth) because of their widely publicized‚Äîand later discredited‚Äîcampaign against 2004 U.S. presidential candidate John Kerry. Since the political smear campaign that the group conducted against Kerry, the term has come into common use to refer to a harsh attack by a political opponent that is dishonest, personal, and unfair. The Swift Boat Veterans and media pundits objected to this use of the term to define a smear campaign. Origin The term \\"Swift Boat\\" itself refers to a class of United States Navy vessel used during the Vietnam War. During the 2004 presidential campaign, John Kerry's heroism under fire as a Swift Boat commander in Vietnam was a centerpiece of his campaign. A number of Vietnam veterans who had served on Swift Boats formed a 527 organization called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (later renamed Swift Vets and POWs for Truth or SVPT) with the intent of discrediting his military record and attacking his subsequent antiwar activities as a member of Vietnam Veterans Against the War. The group produced a series of television ads and a bestselling book, Unfit for Command. The unsubstantiated charges against Kerry by the SVPT gave rise to the term \\"swiftboating\\" as a synonym for \\"the nastiest of campaign smears\\", \\"a slimy political attack\\", and, for many, \\"ugly, unprincipled slander\\". As the purpose of a tax-exempt 527 organization is \\"to focus on the issues\\" rather than \\"attack or defend a specific candidate\\", the SBVT was fined by the Federal Election Commission in 2004 for specifically attacking Kerry instead of focusing on political issues. Later use Charges of \\"swiftboating\\" were made by supporters of both major candidates in the 2012 presidential election. Republican Party strategists compared attacks on Mitt Romney's tenure at Bain Capital to swiftboating: \\"It's very clear they are trying to re-create and take a page out for the 2004 Bush campaign.\\" The term was also used by a representative of Barack Obama's re-election campaign to describe the documentary film Dishonorable Disclosures and an associated ad campaign released by the Special Operations OPSEC Education Fund on the topic of the death of Osama bin Laden. The feminist Gloria Steinem has accused Donald Trump of swiftboating his rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race, calling her 'Crooked Hillary', despite his record of much more frequent and severe lying. Hillary Clinton compared Republicans' statements about Christine Blasey Ford during the Kavanaugh confirmation process to the \\"swift-boating of John Kerry\\". The New York Times reported in 2008 that many Swift Boat veterans, \\"especially those who had nothing to do with the group that attacked Senator John Kerry's military record in the 2004 election‚Äîwant their good name back, and the good names of the men not lucky enough to come home alive\\", expressed regret and dismay that the term \\"swift boat\\" has come to represent a political attack and \\"political chicanery\\" against a member of a different party. Conservative objections and use The use of this term as a pejorative has resulted in objections from some conservatives who object to the implied criticism of the tactics used by Swift Vets and POWs for Truth. In 2006, conservative commentator Emmett Tyrrell denounced its repeated negative usage, saying it \\"is about to join such terms as McCarthyism and McCarthyite\\" as a \\"hate term\\". In a 2006 interview, John O'Neill, spokesman for Swift Vets and POWs for Truth, called the term's usage a \\"baseless smear against somebody's personal character\\". Republican Newt Gingrich, putting his own twist on the neologism at a presidential campaign stop on January 1, 2012, said he felt he was being \\"Romney-boated\\" by the barrage of negative ads run against him. Fox News Radio host John Gibson has written a book titled How the Left Swiftboated America, in which he defines swiftboating as \\"the political trick of claiming to expose truth while in fact lying\\".

Major earned his first DCM in World War II in 1945 after a successful reconnaissance mission in Zwolle. As he was sent to scout the city with one of his best friends, a firefight broke out in which his friend was killed, yet he still decided to continue, after which he found that the city was mostly deserted by the German occupational army. Thanks to his efforts Zwolle was spared from the artillery fire that was planned the next day by the Allies. He received his second DCM during the Korean War for leading the capture of a key hill in 1951. Life Born on January 23, 1921, New Bedford, Massachusetts, to French-Canadian parents, L√©o Major moved with his family to Montreal before his first birthday. Due to a poor relationship with his father, he moved to live with an aunt at age 14. This relationship combined with a lack of available work led Major to join the Canadian army in 1940 to prove to his father that he was \\"somebody to be proud of\\". = World War II = Major was serving with the R√©giment de la Chaudi√®re which landed on the beaches in the Normandy Invasion on June 6, 1944. During a reconnaissance mission on D-Day, Major captured a German armoured vehicle (a halftrack) by himself. The vehicle contained German communication equipment and secret codes. Days later, during his first encounter with an SS patrol, he killed four soldiers; however, one of them managed to ignite a phosphorus grenade. After the resulting explosion, Major lost one eye but continued to fight. He continued his service as a scout and a sniper by insisting he needed only one eye to sight his weapon. According to him, he \\"looked like a pirate\\". Major single-handedly captured 93 German soldiers during the Battle of the Scheldt in Zeeland in southern Netherlands. During a reconnaissance, while alone, he spotted two German soldiers walking along a dike. As it was raining and cold, Major said to himself, \\"I am frozen and wet because of you so you will pay.\\" He captured the first German and attempted to use him as bait so he could capture the other. The second attempted to use his gun, but Major quickly killed him. He went on to capture their commanding officer and forced him to surrender. The German garrison surrendered themselves after three more were shot dead by Major. In a nearby village, SS troops who witnessed German soldiers being escorted by a Canadian soldier shot at their own soldiers, killing seven and injuring some others. Major disregarded the enemy fire and kept escorting his prisoners to the Canadian front line. Major then ordered a passing Canadian tank to fire on the SS troops. He marched back to camp with nearly a hundred prisoners. Thus, he was chosen to receive a Distinguished Conduct Medal. He declined the invitation to be decorated, however, because according to him General Montgomery (who was to present him with the award) was \\"incompetent\\" and in no position to be giving out medals. Dirk Staat, conservator of the Dutch National Military Museum, doubts that L√©o Major really captured 93 German soldiers and refused a medal, because according to him there's nothing about this in the army's documents of the time. https://www.destentor.nl/zwolle/leo-major-en-de-bevrijding-van-zwolle-feit-en- verzinsel-van-elkaar-gescheiden~af9458b7/ > \\"Maar over dat alles is helemaal niets over terug te vinden.

Would be really weird, I cannot imagine that.\\" In February 1945, Major was helping a military chaplain load corpses from a destroyed Tiger tank into a Bren Carrier. After they finished, the chaplain and the driver seated themselves in the front while Major jumped in the back of the vehicle. The carrier struck a land mine. Major claimed to have remembered a loud blast, followed by his body being thrown into the air and smashing down hard on his back. He lost consciousness and awoke to find two concerned medical officers trying to assess his condition. He simply asked if the chaplain was okay. They did not answer his question, but proceeded to load him onto a truck so he could be transported to a field hospital away, stopping every 15 minutes to inject morphine to relieve the pain in his back. = First Distinguished Conduct Medal = Leo Majorlaan (L√©o Major Lane) street sign in the Dutch city of Zwolle. The text reads: Canadian first liberator of Zwolle (1921‚Äì2008) Stories about L√©o Major's reconnaissance of Zwolle have been exaggerated and conflated with his other deeds and there are several conflicting accounts of what happened. At the beginning of April, the R√©giment de la Chaudi√®re were approaching the city of Zwolle, which was shown to have strong German resistance. The commanding officer asked for two volunteers to scout the German force before the artillery began firing on the city. Private Major and his friend Corporal Willie Arseneault stepped forward to accept the task. To keep the city intact, the pair decided to try to capture Zwolle alone, though they were only supposed to ascertain the German numbers and try to contact the Dutch Resistance. Around midnight on 13 April, Arseneault was killed by German firehttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14040378/welly- arsenault 1 after accidentally giving away the pair's position.https://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/leo-major-1921-2008~b76cd21f/ In a radio interview with RTV Zwolle L√©o Major told that he became mad after that, but managed to control himself.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnkx4TIlzJA Major killed two more of the Germans, but the rest of the group fled in a vehicle. He decided to continue his mission alone. He entered Zwolle near Sassenpoort. What happened after that is not clear: According to the Canadian Army Journal Vol. 11.3 Fall 2008: > Major [was] carrying two Sten guns and a sack of grenades. He arrived in the > centre of Zwolle at about 0100 hours and found the streets silent and > deserted. Here, he spotted a German machine-gun nest which, since the crew > was sleeping, he promptly attacked and eliminated. He then found a German > scout car and forced one of the Germans, who he had captured, to drive > through the streets with the lights on, flying a white flag. For several > hours, Major moved through the streets in this manner, shooting at any > target he could find, making an impression that a large Canadian force had > arrived. The citizens were awakened but were afraid to come out of their > houses. By a stroke of luck, Private Major came across the head of the local > resistance, Frits Kuipers, and three of his men. By now the Germans appeared > to have fled the city in panic. The group therefore returned to the town > hall and the resistance fighters brought the citizens out into the streets. > The local radio station was used to announce that the town had been > liberated. Major was exhausted but he had to complete his mission by > bringing back the body of his comrade, Wilfrid Arsenault, to his lines. The > resistance fighters arranged for a car to transport the body back, but were > fired on by outposts of the Chaudi√®res. Major was furious and climbed onto > the top of the car so that he could be easily seen from a distance. In this > manner, he returned to the Canadian lines to report the result of his > mission to his commanding officer. According to an article in the Ottawa Citizen: Major \\"worked his way to the city centre\\", captured a soldier \\"at the wheel of a German staff car outside a tavern\\", went inside the tavern with this captive and disarmed the officer who was drinking inside. The two communicated in French. Since \\"the officer was from Alsace-Lorraine, a region near France that was not terribly committed to Adolf Hitler's rabid designs\\", Major \\"took a risk\\" and \\"gave him back his gun.\\" \\"I said the war is almost finished and I am a member of the advance party ‚Äì I didn't say I was alone. I said it's a lovely town and I didn't want nobody to destroy that town.\\" Then Major spend the \\"next few hours engaging patrols whenever he could and setting off grenades where they would make noise, but do little damage.\\" He killed a few, but he mostly wanted to send them into a panic. \\"He chanced up the SS headquarters and surprised eight of the elite force inside.\\" \\"'They pulled a gun on me,' Mr. Major says. 'But you know, with one eye, I can see better than most people at night. I killed four of them; the other four ran away.'\\" According to an article in the Dutch newspaper Trouw: > Hij bereikte de stad en liep er door uitgestorven straten. Hij klopte op > deuren, maar niemand durfde open te doen. \\"Na een poos was ik zo moe dat ik > niet meer helder denken kon. Maar ik had genoeg inlichtingen, nergens > ontmoette ik vijanden.\\" Hij liep in kringen rond, verliet de stad en kwam > bij een boer die hij geruststelde door het woord CANADA aan de binnenkant > van zijn muts aan te wijzen. Al snel had hij contact met de ondergrondse. > Hij kon terug naar zijn eenheid met de melding dat de vijand Zwolle had > verlaten. > He reached the city and walked through deserted streets. He knocked on > doors, but nobody dared to open up. \\"After a while I was so tired that I > couldn't think straight anymore. But I had enough information, nowhere I > encountered enemies.\\" He walked around in circles, left the town and came to > a farmer whom he reassured by pointing at the word CANADA in the inside of > his hat. Quickly he had contact with the underground resistance. He was able > to return to his unit with the message that the enemy left Zwolle. The newspaper also mentions: \\"Maar in de decennia die volgden verwerd Leo Major volgens velen tot een 'Rambo' die wild schietend straat na straat veroverde op ‚Äôzeker duizend‚Äô Duitsers die hardnekkig weerstand boden. Het was een verhaal dat hij ‚Äì zo lachen zijn vrienden mild ‚Äì op het laatst ook zelf steeds iets meer ging geloven.\\" \\"But in the decennia that followed Leo Major became a 'Rambo' who according to many conquered street after street wildly shooting around on 'certainly a thousand' Germans who persistently resisted. It was a story that he ‚Äì so his friends mildly laugh ‚Äì in the end started to believe a little bit himself.\\" According to an article in Jonge Historici (Young Historici): \\"Major liep door de uitgestorven straten en legde contact met de ondergrondse. Daarna keerde hij terug naar zijn regiment, waar hij om 9 uur meldde dat de vijand de stad had verlaten.\\"https://www.jhsg.nl/leo-major- zwolle/ \\"Major walked through deserted streets and established contact with the underground resistance. After that he returned to his regiment, where he at 9 o'clock reported that the enemy had left the city.\\" In an interview with De Stentor, curator Dirk Staat dispels some of the myths: > [B]eschrijvingen dat hij als rambo de stad in vuur en vlam zette, terwijl > hij om zich heen schoot en granaten door de stad gooide; dat beeld klopt > denk ik niet. We hebben politierapporten van die nacht gelezen, en daarin > lezen we niks terug over de onrust. > Descriptions of him setting the city on fire like Rambo, while he was > shooting around him and threw grenades through the city; I don't think that > is the right image. We have read police reports about that night, and within > we read nothing about the unrest. He also thinks the vehicle used by Major was just the car of the head of the local resistance, Frits Kuiper, which Major also used to ride back in the morning. \\"De Duitsers die hij gezien heeft, zullen het staartje zijn van de terugtrekkende bezetter.\\" \\"The Germans [Major] saw, would have been the tail end of the retreating occupation.\\" The story about Major capturing 93 German soldiers is extremely unlikely: > Als je meerdere groepen mee wil nemen, terug naar de Heinoseweg, dan ben je > uren bezig. Dat is logistiek haast niet te doen, dus ik denk het niet. > Daarbij: er valt niets over terug te vinden. In het oorlogsdagboek van zijn > r√©giment lezen we: 'L√©o keert terug, vertelt dat de stad vrij is en heeft > lichaam van Welly bij zich'. Niks over krijgsgevangenen. > If you want to take multiple groups with you, back over the Heinoseweg, > you're busy for hours. That's logistically barely doable, so I don't think > so. Besides: there's nothing to find about this. In the war journal of his > regiment we read 'L√©o returns, tells that the city is free and had body of > Welly with him.' Nothing about prisoners of war.\\" The headquarters of the SS was set on fire that night, but Staat does not think Major was the one who set the fire. \\"[Het gebouw in brand steken] past precies in de modus operandi van vertrekkende Duitsers. Die doden gevangenen en vernietigen dossiers. En wat is effectiever om dossiers te vernietigen, dan het gebouw in brand te zetten?\\" \\"[Setting the building on fire] fits the modus operandi of the retreating Germans. The dead bodies and destroyed dossiers. And what is more effective to destroy dossiers, than to set the building on fire?\\" In a segment on L√©o Major on radio program by RTV Zwolle: \\"De Duitsers staken het huis (...) aan de Potgietsersingel, waar de Duitse politie kantoor hield, in brand om hun documentatie te vernietigen.\\" \\"The Germans set fire to the house (...) on the Potgietersingel, where the German police held office, to destroy their documents.\\" The segment included an interview of L√©o Major, who describes the events of the night. The first thing he did was go to the railroad station, because he \\"thought that's were the Germans would come in\\" and he had \\"heard from Hendriks van Gerner that some of the bridges were destroyed.\\" He entered the city through the Sassenpoort. All the people he met \\"were either collaborators or German (sic.). And the German (sic.) I met, most of them were drunk.\\" He had made noise \\"using grenades and my machine-gun\\". \\"So most of [the Germans], I think, were caught in panic and ran away from me.\\" Major was back at camp by 5:00 am, 7:00 am, or 9:00 am. and thanks to his efforts, the planned shelling of the city would be called off and his R√©giment de la Chaudi√®re could enter the city without a fight. Major then took his dead friend back to the van Gerner farm until regimental reinforcements could carry him away. For his actions, he received the Distinguished Conduct Medal. =Second Distinguished Conduct Medal= When the war in Korea broke out, the Canadian government decided to raise a force to join the United Nations in repelling the communist invasion. Major was called back and ended up in the Scout and Sniper Platoon of 2nd Battalion Royal 22e R√©giment of the 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade, 1st Commonwealth Division. Major fought in the First Battle of Maryang San where he received a bar to his Distinguished Conduct Medal for capturing and holding a key hill in November 1951. Hill 355, nicknamed Little Gibraltar, was a strategic feature, commanding the terrain for twenty miles around, so the Communists were determined to take it before the truce talks came to an agreement which would lock each side into their present positions. Hill 355 was held by the 3rd US Infantry Division, who linked up with the Canadian's Royal 22e R√©giment on the Americans' western flank.National Archives of Canada, RG 24, Vol 18357, R22eR War Diary, Commander's Conference, 19 November 1951. On November 22, the 64th Chinese Army (around 40,000 men) began their attack: over the course of two days, the Americans were pushed back from Hill 355 by elements of the Chinese 190th and 191st Divisions. The 3rd US Infantry Division tried to recapture the hill, but without any success, and the Chinese had moved to the nearby Hill 227, practically surrounding the Canadian forces. To relieve pressure, an elite scout and sniper team led by L√©o Major was brought up. Armed with Sten guns, Major and his 18 men silently crept up Hill 355. At a signal, Major's men opened fire, panicking the Chinese who were trying to understand why the firing was coming from the center of their troops instead of from the outside. By 12:45 am, they had retaken the hill. However, an hour later, two Chinese divisions (the 190th and the 191st, totaling around 14,000 men) counter- attacked. Major was ordered to retreat, but refused and found scant cover for his men. He held the enemy off throughout the night, though they were so close to him that Major's own mortar bombs were practically falling on him. The commander of the mortar platoon, Captain Charly Forbes, later wrote that Major was \\"an audacious man ... not satisfied with the proximity of my barrage and asks to bring it closer...In effect, my barrage falls so close that I hear my bombs explode when he speaks to me on the radio.\\"Charly Forbes, Fantassin (Sillery, Les √âditions du Septentrion, 1994) 315.

Although predominantly a girls‚Äô school, St Mary's accepts both boys and girls until Grade 2, and currently caters for approximately 900 students from Kindergarten to Year 12. It is located on the grounds of St Mary's Cathedral, next to the Junior School campus of St Virgil's College. Boys who attend St Mary's for Kindergarten to Year 2 generally transfer to St Virgil's College Junior School Campus located just next door. St Mary's College is a member of the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australia. In 2008 St Mary's College celebrated its 140th birthday as a school of the Presentation Sisters. Its slogan to celebrate this year was \\"St Mary's College. A proud past. A strong future\\". History St Mary's College was founded by the Presentation Sisters in 1868, and although students are no longer exclusively taught by sisters of the order, they still administer the college. Originally there were two schools on the present-day campus - St Columba's (a free primary school for the poorer community) and Mt St Mary's. The two were eventually merged. The original convent and school-rooms are still on-site today. Although it is primarily an all-girls school, until the opening of St Virgil's College in 1911, the college catered for boys in senior grades as well. The college only taught Preparatory to Grade 12 until 1996, when the Kindergarten was opened. Until the 1990s the college's Principal was always a member of the order, but the last of the Presentation Sisters to be Principal was Sister Barbara Amott. Sister Barbara has been a teacher and active member of St Mary's College for many years, and has been Principal on several different occasions. The current Principal is Helen Spencer. Curriculum St Mary's College is currently implementing the Australian Curriculum in grades Prep-10. All subjects are compulsory in grades 7 and 8. In grades 9 and 10, students choose a certain number of elective subjects, as well as having core subjects. In Grade 11/12, students choose subjects which must add up to a minimum of 700 hours per year. Many of these subjects are prerequisites for university courses. Co- curriculum The School offers a variety of after-school activities in both sporting and arts areas. Sports include Hockey, Badminton, Soccer and Rowing. The rowing boat shed is jointly own by St Mary's College, St Virgil's College and Guilford Young College, and is located in Newtown Bay. Other activities include the Junior and Senior School Choirs, the Senior Choral Group, the Senior Concert and Jazz bands, St Vincent de Paul Society, Debating, and Public Speaking. In the past, the college held a biannual Arts Festival, which went for the three days before Hobart Show Day. During this week the students were allowed to choose from a variety of activities that included making jewellery, painting murals, and learning to belly dance. The Long Lunch, a picnic lunch on the school lawns, happened every arts festival, as did \\"KickArts\\", a competition in which other local schools entered their rock bands. Religion St Mary's College is located next to St Mary's Cathedral. The College celebrates the Catholic liturgical year by attending Mass.

This appointment was due, in large part, to the influence of the Eclectic Society and two notable men, John Newton and William Wilberforce, who were keen for a committed evangelical Christian to take the role of chaplain in the colony. Johnson and his wife Mary sailed with the First Fleet and arrived in Australia in 1788. In addition to guiding the spiritual life of convicts, soldiers and settlers in the new colony, Johnson was charged with providing education to the convicts. At the first Christian service held at Sydney Cove on Sunday, 3 February 1788, Johnson took as his text Psalm 116:12-13: What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. As Governor Arthur Phillip was primarily concerned with finding means of feeding and housing the soldiers and convicts in the harsh conditions of the colony in its early years, labour could not be spared for the building of a church. Services were held in the open air and even four years later, when Johnson appealed to Phillip for churches at both Sydney and Parramatta, he had no success. Under lieutenant-governors Grose and Paterson, Johnson fared even worse. Grose made vague charges against him and Johnson made many complaints about the treatment he received. He was given a grant of land where the suburb of Ashbury now stands and worked it so successfully with the help of some convict labour that, in November 1790, Captain Tench called him the best farmer in the country. He planted seeds of oranges and lemons he had obtained at Rio de Janeiro, which later on produced good crops of fruit, and occasional references are found to his having made a fortune by his farming; this is all probability an overstatement, though he sold his land and stock to good advantage when he left the colony. In 1790 he and Mary had a daughter, who was given the Aboriginal name Milbah. They also had a son in 1792. In June 1793, tired of waiting on the authorities, he began to build a church himself, and by September, at a cost of about ¬£67, completed a building capable of holding 500 people. Even allowing for the difference in the purchasing power of money and the comparative flimsiness of the structure, this was a remarkable achievement. This church was burnt down in 1798. Johnson, with his wife Mary, taught between 150 and 200 school children in this church. An assistant chaplain, the Reverend Samuel Marsden, was appointed in the same year and arrived early in 1794; and henceforth Johnson had the support of a stronger personality than his own. In 1794 he published An Address to the Inhabitants of the Colonies established in New South Wales and Norfolk Island and, in 1800, obtained leave of absence to visit England. He sailed on the Buffalo in October and did not return to Australia. In June 1802 King in a dispatch said: \\"I understand that Rev'd Mr Johnson does not mean to return.\\" Practically he retired in 1802, but so late as July 1805 he appears on a list of officers as \\"On leave in England, no successor or second clergyman appointed\\". Return to England and later life After returning to England, in about August 1801 Johnson took up a curacy with the Reverend Thomas Dykes of St John's, Kingston-upon-Hull. During this time he had opportunity to influence William Cowper, who became the third chaplain to New South Wales after being recruited by Samuel Marsden. In November 1803 Johnson was curate at Bunwell, Norfolk, a position he occupied until he moved to West Thurrock, Essex, in April 1809. In 1810 he was presented by the king to the united parishes of St Antholin and St John Baptist, in London. He never served as a curate at Ingham, despite oft-repeated claims to the contrary. The Richard Johnson who served at Ingham was a different person. Johnson continued to take an interest in Australia, appearing before the House of Commons Select Committee on Transportation in 1812 and in 1815 he recommended John Youl to be chaplain at Port Dalrymple. He died on 13 March 1827. See also *Journals of the First Fleet *Richard Johnson Anglican School References This article incorporates public domain text from the reference.

Located in Linden and Elizabeth, New Jersey, and bisected by Morses Creek, it is the northernmost refinery on the East Coast of the United States. The oil refinery converts crude oil (supplied by tanker ships from the North Sea, Canada and West Africa and by rail from the Bakken Formation in North Dakota) into gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, propane and heating oil. As of 2007, the facility processed approximately of crude oil, producing of gasoline and of distillates. Its products are delivered to East Coast customers via pipeline transport, barges, railcars and tank trucks. The facility also houses a petrochemical plant which produces lubricants and additives and a polypropylene plant that produces over 775 million pounds of polypropylene per year. The refinery has its own railway container terminal and heliport. The workers at the plant have been unionized under the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Local No. 877) since 1960. The refinery has had and continues to have environmental issues, culminating in the major $225 million Exxon Mobil-New Jersey Environmental Contamination settlement. A 2010 investigative report conducted by WABC-TV, the ABC flagship station in New York City, characterizes the Bayway Refinery as a \\"repeat offender\\" of environmental regulations.  History  In 1907, Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller acquired several hundred acres of the former Morse family estate between Linden and Elizabeth, New Jersey as the site for his latest refinery. Construction of temporary office buildings began on October 15, 1907 and work clearing the heavily wooded land began immediately. The cornerstone of the machine shop, the first permanent structure at the site, was laid on January 18, 1908, and construction continued throughout the year. The first crude stills at Bayway were completed in late 1908 and on January 2, 1909, they were symbolically fired up by William C. Koehler (c1880-1953). The facility began processing an initial of crude oil per day. Capacity was expanded to an estimated by 1911. Over the next several years the plant continued expanding and increasing capacity and workforce. In 1911, Standard Oil was broken up into smaller units in accordance with the Sherman Antitrust Act. One of these successor companies was Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, the precursor to Esso and later Exxon, which retained the ownership of the Bayway facilities. Bayway became a leading research facility within the S.O. New Jersey enterprise. It was the first facility in the United States to employ the use of hydrogenation process to get greater yields from its crude products, and in 1919 scientists at Bayway created the world's first petrochemical: isopropyl alcohol. The Ethyl Corporation, a joint venture of General Motors and Standard Oil, built a plant for the manufacture of tetraethyl lead (TEL, the \\"lead\\" in leaded gasoline) at the refinery over the course of three months in 1924. Within the first two months of its operation, the facility had seventeen cases of severe lead poisoning leading to hallucinations and insanity, and then five deaths in quick succession. The plant was shut down by the state of New Jersey in October, and Standard Oil was forbidden to manufacture TEL there again without state permission.Kovarik, Bill. \\"Charles F. Kettering and the 1921 Discovery of Tetraethyl Lead In the Context of Technological Alternatives \\", presented to the Society of Automotive Engineers Fuels & Lubricants Conference, Baltimore, Maryland., 1994; revised in 1999. During World War II, the plant constructed its first catalytic cracker, or \\"cat cracker\\", which went into operation on January 18, 1943. This development proved essential to the production of fuel to support the Allied war effort, especially high-octane aviation fuel, and also allowed the production of synthetic butyl rubber and materials used to manufacture explosives.\\"New 'Gas' plant ready\\", January 17, 1943,The New York Times After the war, the use of coal for heating declined sharply in the United States. In 1947, Esso invested $26 million in a refinery expansion program to meet an increased post-war demand for gasoline and heating oil, and constructed a second, much larger catalytic cracker with an initial processing capacity of , replacing the original 1943 unit. The \\"Cat\\" came online in October 1949 and was the largest in the world during the twentieth century, and as of 2008 was the largest in the western hemisphere. In 1965 Enjay Chemical, a subsidiary of the Esso Chemical Company (which later became Exxon Chemical) in the Standard Oil Company New Jersey (known publicly mostly by the Esso, Enco and Humble brands) assumed all of the chemical processing assets and products at Bayway. In 1973, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was renamed Exxon, and the facility likewise became known as the Exxon Bayway Refinery. On the night of December 5, 1970 a series of powerful explosions occurred at the refinery, resulting in multiple injuries but no fatalities in and around the plant. Windows were shattered as far away as Staten Island, and the explosion was felt more than thirty miles away. 1976 brought about the installation of the most iconic structure at the refinery, the Wet Gas Scrubber. Visible from the New Jersey Turnpike with its giant plumes of water vapor, this device eliminates 7-8 tons of dust per day as well as gases generated from the catalytic cracking process. To this day it is recognized as one of the most efficient and effective units of its kind in the world. On the night of January 1‚Äì2, 1990, a cracked underwater pipeline leaked about of fuel oil into the Arthur Kill. Because the waterway was already so heavily industrialized, Exxon argued that it should not have to pay any damages. The court disagreed, ordering the company to pay $15 million in reparations.Burger, Joanna: Before and after an oil Spill: the Arthur Kill, pages 1-7. Rutgers University Press, 1994. On April 8, 1993, the Tosco Corporation finalized proceedings to purchase the refinery from Exxon for a sum of $175 million, although the Exxon Chemical Company continued to run the Chemical Plant. During this time Bayway was operated by Bayway Refining Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Tosco Corporation. Under the direction of Tosco, Bayway was able to reorganize and upgrade the facility, and years of operating at a loss for Exxon in the later 1980s were turned around swiftly. The Morristown and Erie Railway became the contract switcher for the refinery in 1995, and set up the Bayshore Terminal Company to handle the management of 8,000 railroad cars full of various refinery products each year. Since 2007, the EMD SW1500 diesel locomotive has been assigned to the plant. In 1999, the Infineum company (a joint project of Exxon Chemical, Shell International Chemicals and Shell Chemical) took over operation of the chemical plant. Infineum researches and produces crankcase lubricant additives, fuel additives, and specialty lubricant additives, as well as automatic transmission fluids, gear oils, and industrial oils.\\"Bayway Refinery \\", Bayshore Terminal Company. Tosco was bought in 2001 by Phillips Petroleum, which merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips in 2002 and later spun off downstream, midstream and chemical assets into a new Phillips 66 company in 2012. In 2003 a new polypropylene facility went online that produces 775 million pounds per year.  Environmental issues  The refinery was the famous toxic site in question in the 2015 legal settlement between New Jersey and ExxonMobil. In late 2003, the refinery came under scrutiny for a possibly abnormal cancer rate among its work population. As a result, local ABC affiliate WABC-TV (Channel 7), New York, ran a feature about the refinery. The refinery has since been subject to scrutiny by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The refinery has consistently been ranked among the worst polluters in the nation, and has been cited almost 200 times since 2005 for violation of state environmental laws. It is also ranked as the 32nd worst water polluter in the country. = 2005 environmental control measures = Thanks to the terms of a settlement with the Department of Environmental Protection, ConocoPhillips stated that it would take the following actions at their Bayway facilities: * Install a cover on the wastewater separator or a new covered separator, and controls, by December 2008. This measure, which would cost approximately $8 million, would reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds, (VOCs) at the treatment unit by 95 percent. * Install a new fuel gas system by December 2010 to burn cleaner natural gas instead of fuel oil, reducing SO2 emissions by thousands of tons per year. This would cost $28 million to $38 million. * Install new pollution controls on heaters and boilers by December 2010 at cost of $20 million, reducing annual NOx emissions by approximately 900 tons. * Reduce emissions of VOCs by implementing an enhanced leak detection and repair program. * Reduce VOC and acid gas emissions by minimizing flaring. * Audit and reduce benzene emissions.

It consists of a small parking lot and a riverfront pathway, the southernmost section of the Hudson River Valley Greenway. It is known for its physical proximity to the Hudson River on one side of the pathway and the looming cliffs of the Palisades rising above on the other side. The park is included within the Palisades Interstate Park system and is functionally part of a continuous complex of parks that also includes Rockland Lake State Park, Hook Mountain State Park, and Haverstraw Beach State Park. History The Palisades Interstate Park Commission purchased what was to become Nyack Beach State Park in 1911 to provide space for recreation, and to protect the land from the effects of quarrying that were impacting the Hudson River Palisades during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Along with a portion of adjacent Hook Mountain State Park, Nyack Beach was declared a National Natural Landmark in April 1980 for its portion of the Palisades Sill. Park description The park offers picnicking, hiking, bicycling, fishing, and cross-country skiing along the pathway. The path is flat and handicapped- accessible. The pathway runs for along the river towards Rockland Lake State Park. As the name implies, the park originally included a swimming beach which has been closed for many years due to pollution in the Hudson River. In 2005, it was suggested that the beach could be reopened for swimming due to the improved condition of the river. =Wildlife= Hawks and raptors nest in the cliff and are easily viewed from the pathway. In 1994 there was a harbor seal at the park, and in 1995 a harbor seal spent much of August in the vicinity of the park.

It is listed in the Red book of Russian Federation as a protected species with an unclear status, generally considered to be endangered, although the IUCN lists it as \\"least concern\\". It populates the Transbaikal region of Russia (this region is sometimes called Dauria, hence the name) and Northern Mongolia. It lives in dens and inhabits both forests and steppes. The steppes consists mainly of grassland plains and scrublands. The Daurian hedgehog actively select scrublands and rocky areas, perhaps for greater cover and concealment from predators. This species of hedgehogs are known to utilize larger home ranges than other hedgehog species. The adult Daurian hedgehog is 15 to 20 centimeters long and weighs up to 1 kilogram (usually around 600 grams). Most live up to six years in nature. Like most hedgehog species in temperate regions, the Daurian hibernates during the winter. After introduction and extensive use of pesticides in mid-1960s, the Russian population of the Daurian hedgehog suffered a major loss. Since that time, the species seems to have had a modest recovery, although the population has not yet returned to its original size. Currently, it seems to be moving northwards and closer to cities due to more abundant food, less danger from agricultural activities and newfound human tolerance for their presence. Cases of successfully starting new populations by artificially moving several adults to new areas have been reported. Due to the low population density of the region the complete status of this species is unclear.

He is the namesake of Mellette, South Dakota and Mellette County, South Dakota. Early life, education, and Civil War Mellette was the son of Charles Mellette and was born in Henry County, Indiana. He was educated at Marion Academy in Marion, Indiana. In 1862, Mellette entered Indiana University Bloomington as a sophomore and graduated in 1863. On October 6, 1864, he enlisted in Company H of the 9th Indiana Volunteers, serving as a conscripted soldier until mustering out on September 28, 1865. He served in the army as a substitute for his older invalid brother and experienced many humiliations as a result. In 1866, Mellette graduated from the School of Law at the Indiana University and went to Muncie, Indiana, where he began practicing law with Thomas J. Brady. On May 26, 1866, he married Margaret Wylie. Career Mellette was elected as district attorney for Delaware County, Indiana. In 1870, Mellette purchased the Muncie Times, a newspaper which became influential and prosperous under his tutelage. During that same year, Mellette was elected the county superintendent of schools. When his wife became ill, Mellette visited western states to find a climate that would be more beneficial to her. Mellette's family eventually settled in Springfield, Dakota Territory, for two years; and, Mellette served as register of the United States Land Office in Springfield until the land office was moved to Watertown, Dakota Territory, in 1880. Political career in the Dakotas In October 1885, the Republicans nominated Mellette for governor of Dakota Territory. In November 1885, Mellette ran unopposed for the office of governor; and, voters selected Huron as the temporary capitol of Dakota Territory. In 1889, voters approved the new constitution for South Dakota and elected Arthur C. Mellette as South Dakota's first Governor. On November 2, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison signed the proclamation to make South Dakota the fortieth state. Mellette County, South Dakota is named in his honor. Personal life Mellette House in Watertown, South Dakota Mellette built a mansion on the bluffs of the Big Sioux River in Watertown, South Dakota. He was an advocate of bringing the capitol to the area. He summered on Lake Kampeska. Death The family made what was meant to be a temporary move from Watertown to Pittsburg, Kansas in 1895. Mellette died May 25, 1896 while in Pittsburg. His body was sent back to Watertown and interred in Mount Hope Cemetery. The Trail of Governors statue of Arthur C.

She is the last of four sister ships built by the naval shipyards of Bilbao, Spain, in 1982, all built to a design similar to the 1930 designs of the German firm Blohm & Voss, like Gorch Fock, and the NRP Sagres. Built at the Celaya Shipyards in Bilbao, she was designed by Naval Engineer Juan Jos√© Alonso Ver√°stegui. Her keel was laid on July 24, 1981, and she was delivered to the Mexican Navy in Bilbao on July 29, 1982. Her first commander was Captain Manuel Zerme√±o del Pe√≥n, in command of a crew of cadets from the Mexican Naval Academy who received the ship and brought Cuauht√©moc home to Mexico. Like her sister ships, Colombia's , Ecuador's Guayas and Venezuela's Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, Cuauht√©moc is a sailing ambassador for her home country and a frequent visitor to world ports, having sailed over in her 38 years of service, with appearances at the Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Races, ASTA Tall Ships Challenges, Sail Osaka, and others. Crest The body of the shield is made up of two concentric circles: the exterior, like a cord of abaca, suggests the ship's rigging, the tool necessary for the crew to raise and lower the sails. The inner circle serves to concentrically divide the total circumference of the body. The internal part of these carries in its center the silhouette of Cuauht√©moc on its port side and with all the rigging, sailing to the west, driven by the wind, represents her first trip to Mexico from Spain. In the ring formed by the two circles there are two inscriptions: reading Armada de M√©xico (Mexican Navy) on the top, and Buque Escuela Cuauht√©moc (Cuauht√©moc School Ship), on the bottom. The same ring offers, at the eastern point, the figure of the wind god Eh√©catl, who with his breath propels the ship to the west.

South Side Irish St. Patrick's Day Parade The South Side Irish Parade is one of three annual St. Patrick's Day parades in Chicago. The South Side Irish Parade originally started in 1979. There was another South Side parade called the Southtown Parade started in the early 1950s. The original Southtown Parade route was on 79th Street from Ashland Avenue to Halsted Avenue in the St. Sabina Parish in Auburn Gresham neighborhood. Some years after Richard J. Daley was elected mayor in 1955, he moved the Southtown Parade downtown and changed the name to the St. Patrick's Day Parade, though it continued on its old route until at least 1958. WCKG-FM Radio's \\"Rock 'N Roller\\" mobile studio the Chicago South Side Irish Parade On Saturday, March 17, 1979, best friends and original creators George Hendry and Pat Coakley, along with their wives, assembled 17 children (known forever in parade lore as the \\"Wee Folks of Washtenaw and Talman\\") from the West Morgan Park area. The parade route began from the 109th block of S. Washtenaw and Talman streets. Marching to the parade theme of ‚ÄúBring Back St. Pat‚Äù, and an original parade float of a baby buggy covered with shamrocks and the 26 county flags of Ireland, the South Side Irish Parade was born. The theme created by Hendry and Coakley was their way of wanting to bring back the South Side parade that they had enjoyed as children. They had delivered notices along the original parade route to encourage people to participate in the parade by standing and waving from their porches. Popularity continued to grow, and in 1980 it was moved to Kennedy Park with an increased 300 participants, including children, dogs, and a bag piper. It has grown since then and was moved to its current route, down Western Avenue from 103rd Street to 115th Street through the Beverly and Morgan Park neighborhoods, in 1981. The parade, led by the Chicago Stockyard Kilty Band and held on either the Sunday before or the Sunday of St. Patrick's Day every year, it was considered to be one of the largest St. Patrick's Day community celebrations outside of Dublin. The 2008 parade was the 30th annual parade, which was held on Sunday, March 9, 2008.\\"Chicago's South Side Irish St. Patrick's Day Parade\\". Retrieved on 2008-01-08. Of the two Chicago parades, the other being in downtown, the South Side Irish Parade was the more raucous occasion. The 2009 parade was presumably the last parade. On March 25, 2009, the South Side Irish St. Patrick's Day Parade Committee announced that they were not planning to stage a parade in its present form in March 2010. They noted that the event had become too large for the community to accommodate and the difficulty in policing such a large crowd while maintaining the dignity of the event. However the South Side Irish St. Patrick's Day Parade Committee outlined a security plan, saying they \\"feel will bring this great neighborhood tradition back as the family friendly event it was meant to be\\". The parade returned on Sunday, March 11, 2012.

It is situated approximately north of Nottingham city centre. The population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 15,414. It is bordered by Woodthorpe to the northeast, Mapperley to the east, Carrington to the south, New Basford and Basford to the west, and Daybrook and Bestwood to the north. History Several carved, dated stones in buildings indicate development in the area between 1870 and 1910, during the growth of the lace industry. There are also several listed buildings. Sherwood Bus Depot was built in 1900 by Nottingham Corporation Tramways, as part of an initiative to extend the Carrington line to Winchester Street. Trams ran on the route until 6 September 1936 when they were replaced by buses. Part of the premises is now occupied by the Samuel Hall public house, part of the J D Wetherspoon chain, and another part as community meeting rooms known as 'The Place Activity Centre', run by the Sherwood Depot Action Group. Politics The ward of Sherwood (which includes some adjacent neighbourhoods) is represented by Nottingham City Council and has three Labour Party councillors. It lies in the Nottingham East parliamentary constituency, which from 1992 until 2010 was represented by MP John Heppell, and from 2010 by Chris Leslie, who was elected with a majority of 6,969. Amenities Sherwood Post Office in 2009 (since relocated) The Sherwood Inn Sherwood Bus Depot from Mansfield Road Within the area of Sherwood, there are two primary schools: Seely Primary and Nursery School on Perry Road, and Haydn Primary School on Haydn Road. Haydn Road is also the location of Nottingham Free School, which is in Berridge Ward in the neighbourhood of New Basford. Nottingham Prison and Young Offenders' Institute is located on Perry Road. In October 2007, Sherwood Police Station opened at 621 Mansfield Road, allowing for a more visible local police presence. As a result, crime fell by 13% from 2008 to 2009. The station was one of twelve sites closed three years later as part of a cost-saving drive. Only a police contact centre next to the library remains. The main shopping precinct lies along the busy A60 Mansfield Road. High street shops such as Boots, LloydsPharmacy, Wilko and Co-op Food are interspersed with charity shops, including Oxfam and Cancer Research UK and several restaurants. Other amenities include a sub-post office, newsagents, butchers, stationers, dentists, garages, greengrocers, hairdressers, caf√©s, estate agencies, the Nottingham Building Society and several pubs. The Jason Spencer Sports Ground was built in 2011 on Valley Road after the murder of local teenager, Jason Spencer. It has a basketball court, an outdoor gym and a skate park. Sherwood Community Centre lies at the northern end of Mansfield Road, opposite the Woodthorpe Grange Park. It is the meeting place of many well established local groups such as the Bobbin Lace Society, the Sherwood Playgroup and the Prince's Trust. It also hosts a wide variety of activities, including adult ballet and tap classes, yoga, creative embroidery and Zumba. Sherwood Library, on the corner of Mansfield Road and Spondon Street, holds regular community events. Sherwood has a number of churches, including St Martin's Church on Trevose Gardens, Sherwood Methodist Church on Devon Drive, and United Reformed Church on Edwards Lane. Sherwood Art Week Sherwood has a thriving arts scene and each year hosts Sherwood Art Week. Each year a series of exhibitions, craft fairs and workshops takes place, bringing the artistic community together.

Ramm (1 August 1916 in Butte, Montana - 11 August 1992 in Irvine, California) was a Baptist theologian and apologist within the broad evangelical tradition. He wrote prolifically on topics concerned with biblical hermeneutics, religion and science, Christology, and apologetics.Benard Ramm entry (written by Kevin Vanhoozer) in Handbook of Evangelical Theologians. Walter A. Elwell. Baker Books, 1993. pp.290-306. .Roger E. Olson. The SCM Press A-Z of evangelical theology. SCM-Canterbury Press Ltd, 2005. . pp.48-51 The hermenuetical principles presented in his 1956 book Protestant Biblical Interpretation influenced a wide spectrum of Baptist theologians.A genetic history of Baptist thought: with special reference to Baptists in Britain and North America. William H. Brackney. Mercer University Press, 2004. . pp. 500 During the 1970s he was widely regarded as a leading evangelical theologian as well known as Carl F.H. Henry. His equally celebrated and criticized 1954 book The Christian View of Science and Scripture was the theme of a 1979 issue of the Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation, while a 1990 issue of Baylor University's Perspectives in Religious Studies was devoted to Ramm's views on theology. Education Ramm initially studied chemistry then switched to philosophy of science in preparation for ministry. His tertiary education included a B.A. (University of Washington), B.D. (Eastern Baptist Seminary), M.A. in 1947 & Ph.D in 1950 (University of Southern California).PSCF 44 (March 1992): 2-9. He undertook additional studies at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Basel, Switzerland (1957-1958 academic year with Karl Barth), and the Near Eastern School of Theology, Beirut, Lebanon. Career His academic teaching career began in 1943, when he joined the faculty at the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (now Biola University, La Mirada, California). He became Professor of Philosophy at Bethel College and Seminary, and then Professor of Religion at Baylor University, Texas. Most of his academic teaching took place at the American Baptist Seminary of the West at Covina, California, where he taught 1958‚Äì74 and again 1978-86. At that seminary he held the post of Professor of Systematic Theology. Writings Ramm wrote eighteen books, contributed chapters to other books, and authored over one hundred articles and book reviews that were published in various theological periodicals. In his contributions to Christian apologetics, Ramm began his career in the evidentialist camp, but his later work reflected a shift in viewpoint to a modified form of presuppositional apologetics that had some affinity with the work of Edward John Carnell. In spite of harsh criticisms of Karl Barth from more traditionally Calvinist apologists such as Cornelius Van Til, Gordon Clark, and Carl F. H. Henry, Ramm would explore much of Barth's theological viewpoint, eventually embracing Barth's theology almost wholeheartedly as outlined in Ramm's own book After Fundamentalism (Harper & Row, 1983). Ramm did not utilise the classical or Thomist approach in arguments for God's existence. He maintained that apart from faith God was unknowable. He likewise emphasised that the noetic effects of sin rendered theistic proofs useless. In Ramm's view, the proof of God's existence is in Holy Scripture. He argued that the primary use of apologetic evidences is to create a favourable climate of opinion so that the Gospel may be proclaimed, and believed. In this respect he felt that miracles and fulfilled prophecy provided a factual basis for that climate of opinion. Ramm placed strong emphasis on the inner witness of the Holy Spirit verifying the gospel to the believer. In some respects Ramm's emphasis on the inner witness of the Spirit reflected the view of John Calvin, but it also reflected the influence of Karl Barth, under whom he studied in Switzerland.Mark A. Noll. Between Faith and Criticism. Regent College Publishing, 2004. . pp.95, 178, 261, 270. Near the end of his life, Ramm was honored with a book of essays by his colleagues and younger contemporaries. =Influence of The Christian View of Science and Scripture= In his book, The Christian View of Science and Scripture, published in 1954, he was critical of \\"flood geology\\" and the notion of a young earthRadiocarbon Dating and American Evangelical Christians and influenced the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) in not supporting \\"flood geology\\" during the 1950s before Henry M. Morris and John C. Whitcomb popularised Young Earth Creationism and Flood geology in their 1961 book entitled The Genesis Flood. Reformed theologian Meredith G. Kline known for advancing the framework interpretation of Genesis cites this book in his influential article \\"Because It Had Not Rained\\" Because It Had Not Rained The Westminster Theological Journal 20 (1958):146-157 after having reviewed it three years earlier,Review of The Christian View of Science and Scripture, by R. Ramm. WTJ 18 (1955/56): 49-55. stating \\"It is, indeed, informative and provocative. Moreover, it has some good emphases. It can, therefore, be read profitably if read critically.\\" yet cautioning \\"It would be well...for teachers of God's people to be hesitant or, at the least, very careful in providing public documentation of the history of their personal struggle after the truth.\\" Kline also found Ramm's defense of the authority of scripture potentially inconsistent and Ramm's hermeneutical question regarding the place of natural revelation in interpreting scripture while a valid one, his approach in exploring and attempting to answer it done with too much zeal and dangerously close to being error-prone. The publisher's choice of title in particular its initial article The Christian View of Science and Scripture turned out to be a magnet for criticism. Ramm's original title was 'The Evangelical Faith and Modern Science', but the publisher changed this in order for it to be similar to the title of James Orr's 1893 book The Christian View of God and the World.JASA 31: 179-186. The year 1979 marked the book's 25th anniversary, which was celebrated by the American Scientific Affiliation in devoting that year's December issue of its journal JASA to Ramm by including evaluations from theologians on the influence of The Christian View of Science and Scripture as well as an interview with Ramm and his wife Alta.JASA 31: 177 In a survey of Religion and Science books, Covenant Theological Seminary professor and ordained PCA minister C. John Collins called this book \\"a classic from a conservative evangelical author.\\"Science & Faith: Friends or Foes?. C. John Collins. Crossway, 2003. . p.351. =Influence of Protestant Christian Evidences= His work Protestant Christian Evidences is considered a classic and is still often cited. Professor Ramm is often quoted for writing the following in his work Protestant Christian Evidences: Ramm also stated, in his often cited work Protestant Christian Evidences, the following: > A historic person named Jesus gave certain men such an impact as to be > unequaled by far in the entire annals of the human race. After nearly two > thousand years the impact is not at all spent, but daily there are people > who have tremendous revolutionary experiences which they associate with > Jesus Christ, be He dead or risen in Heaven.

It brewed Wolaver's Organic Brewery beers from 2002 until 2015, when it ceased brewing that line. Otter Creek In March 1991, Otter Creek brewed its first Copper Ale at 616 Exchange Street in Middlebury and shipped its first keg of beer shortly thereafter. Four years later, the brewery expanded and moved down the road to 793 Exchange Street where they expanded production to 60,000-barrels. Otter Creek Brewing distributes its year-round and seasonal beers to fifteen states in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Otter Creek brews and bottles all of its beers in small batches and uses natural Vermont water; domestic malts and hops; and its own top-fermenting yeast. In 2005, Otter Creek Brewing produced approximately 30,000 barrels of beer and distributed in 22 States. Otter Creek brews three year-round beers: * Free Flow, a 6% American IPA * Berner, a 7% American IPA * Ella, a 5.5% India Pale Lager This current line-up follows a major production overhaul that saw Otter Creek do away with all of their original flagship beers, including their Copper Ale, Stovepipe Porter, and Black IPA. Otter Creek also produces a number of seasonal and occasional beers, almost all of which are also of a hop-forward nature. In 2010, Massachusetts private equity firm Fulham and Co. acquired Otter Creek Brewing through their Long Trail Brewing Company subsidiary. Wolaver's Organic In 1997, Wolaver‚Äôs (based in Nevada City, California) became the first USDA- certified organic brewer. The Wolaver's line only contains organic beers. The company started in Santa Cruz, California but was brewing their ales in several locations including the Mendocino Brewing Company in Ukiah, California, Goose Island Brewery in Chicago, Illinois and Otter Creek in Vermont. About two years later, Wolaver's moved to Nevada City, California and began looking to buy a brewery in 2001. Wolaver's purchased Otter Creek in 2002 to consolidate production. The brewers worked with the organic barley and farmers in the area to create a market for organic hops. All the Wolaver‚Äôs styles are certified organic by Vermont Organic Farmers, and featured wheat and oats grown locally in Addison County, Vermont. Since 2002, all Wolaver‚Äôs Organic were brewed in Middlebury, Vermont. Wolaver's brewed three year-round beers and several seasonals.

Overview  A domain model is a system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a sphere of knowledge, influence or activity (a domainEvans, Eric Domain-Driven Design: Definitions and Pattern Summaries.

The concepts include the data involved in the business and rules the business uses in relation to that data. A domain model leverages natural language of the domain. A domain model generally uses the vocabulary of the domain, thus allowing a representation of the model to be communicated to non-technical stakeholders.

Created by Robert Northshield and original host Charles Kuralt, the 90-minute program currently airs Sundays from 9:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. Eastern, and from 6:00 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. Pacific. Since October 9, 2016, the show has been hosted by Jane Pauley, who also hosts news segments, after the retirement of long-term host Charles Osgood. Osgood was the host for twenty-two years (and is the program's longest-serving host), taking over from Kuralt on April 10, 1994. History The program was originally conceived to be a broadcast version of a Sunday newspaper magazine supplement, most typified by the Sunday New York Times Magazine. The format was conceived as the Sunday equivalent of the CBS Morning News, which following Sunday Mornings debut was retitled to reflect each day of the week (such as Monday Morning, Tuesday Morning, etc.). The weekday broadcasts, which emphasized hard news as opposed to Sunday Mornings focus on feature stories, were originally anchored by Bob Schieffer (Kuralt eventually took over the daily role, and was for a short time joined by Diane Sawyer as co-host). However, the weekday program's then-limited 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. Eastern air time (the long-running Captain Kangaroo was entrenched in the 8:00 a.m. hour) hampered its ability to compete with NBC and ABC's rival two-hour morning shows Today and Good Morning America, though it expanded to 90 minutes (from 7:30 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time) in 1981 and was renamed simply Morning. In 1982, the weekday version was extended to a full two hours and restored its previous CBS Morning News title, later to be replaced by short-lived The Morning Program in 1987. The Sunday version, however, survived, and retains its original format. Long after the daily editions ended, the Sunday edition's opening sequence continued to display all seven days of the week until the early 2000s. On January 25, 2004, CBS News Sunday Morning celebrated its 25th anniversary with clips and highlights from the show's first quarter-century on the air. Host Charles Osgood showed clips from former host Charles Kuralt. The February 1, 2009 broadcast celebrated Sunday Mornings 30th anniversary. Segments examined how the world has changed in the three decades since the program began, the history of Sundays in America and ‚Äì as a tie-in to the show's logo ‚Äì the physics of the sun. An artist was commissioned to create new sun logos for the program, which debuted on that edition and were used in future broadcasts. CBS News correspondent Steve Hartman periodically revisits some of Charles Kuralt's memorable personal profiles. On May 17, 2009, CBS News Sunday Morning began broadcasting in high-definition. In 2014, rebroadcasts of the program began airing on sister cable network Smithsonian Channel (owned by CBS's parent company ViacomCBS), but has since been pulled from that channel's programming. Format Each edition begins with a short summary of national and international news headlines, sports and a national weather forecast ‚Äì which unlike most morning news programs, does not cue to affiliates to run a local weather insert (some local stations will still override the national forecast with a local forecast from their own weather department). It then follows a story totem pole in the center of the CBS soundstage, with previews of featured stories set to air during the broadcast (the first four of which feature clips from the story packages with preview narration by the respective correspondent) being shown prior to the news summary. Each story covered in a given episode has a glass plate with its headline on this pole (digitally inserted on the pole as a prepared graphic since the late 2000s), which the camera follows after Pauley's introductions. Music in the show is usually limited to the opening and closing title theme. Pauley introduces each story with a short monologue, then sends the show out to the taped segment. The show usually ends with a preview of the guests and topics to air on that week's Face the Nation (which follows the program on most CBS stations), followed by a preview of next week's Sunday Morning broadcast. After the commercial break, there is a 60-second tranquil nature scene. Notably, Sunday Morning includes significant coverage of the fine and performing arts, including coverage of topics usually not covered in network news, such as architecture, painting, ballet, opera and classical music, though increasingly more popular forms of music have been included as well. The program's correspondents tend to ask nontraditional questions of guests (for instance, actor Brad Pitt was asked about his love of architecture, and Grant Hill about his painting collection). Television essays similar to the kinds delivered on PBS also appear, and the program generally has a stable of equally positive and negative news stories to fill up the program when there is no breaking news of note. Story lengths are longer (lasting up to twelve minutes at a time) and the pace of the program is considerably quieter and more relaxed than the Monday through Saturday CBS This Morning program. Commentators Ben Stein and Nancy Giles appear in recurring segments, delivering their opinion, and correspondent Bill Geist also contributes human interest stories. The program ends with a nature scene, not given a formal title for most of the program's history, but since entitled \\"Moment of Nature\\" as it is now a sponsored element. Despite the stereotype of the program appealing primarily to senior citizens, Sunday Morning actually placed first in its time slot in the key demographic of adults 25‚Äì54, beating all of the political discussion-driven Sunday morning talk shows. The Sunday Morning Experience is a podcast from the younger fan perspective hosted by married couple, Naomi and Jordan Hillyard, about CBS Sunday Morning. On one occasion, the entire program served as a showcase for classical music; this took place in April 1986, when a live broadcast of Vladimir Horowitz's historic Moscow piano recital was aired. For that presentation only, the program departed from its usual newsmagazine format and devoted the entire 90 minutes to a complete presentation of the recital. Because the recital was given at 4:00 p.m. Moscow time, CBS was able to broadcast it at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The presentation was such a critical and popular success that it was repeated two months later, and was subsequently released on VHS and DVD. =Segments= * Cover Story: The main topic of that week's broadcast. * Almanac: A notable event or the birth or death of a famous person that happened on the same calendar day of the weekly broadcast. * Profile: A look at the accomplishments of famous people * Pulse: A look at facts by different sources. * Passage: A famous person who died within the past week. * Calendar: A look at the week ahead * Moment of Nature: A look at animals and plants at the end of the weekly broadcast Production The program is marked by its distinctive \\"Sun\\" logo, which is prominent in the program's title sequence. In addition, in between some segments, images of the sun in various forms also appear. The show's theme is the trumpet fanfare \\"Abblasen\\", attributed to Gottfried Reiche. A recording of the piece on a baroque trumpet by Don Smithers was used as the show's theme for many years, until producers decided to replace the vinyl recording with a digital of a piccolo trumpet by Doc Severinsen; the current version is played by Wynton Marsalis.

In her segment she showed clips of spoon-bender Uri Geller from the 1980s performing \\"'psychic parlor tricks'\\" but instead of explaining to her audience that Geller had been debunked many times she instead said he was \\"'unreliable'\\", no mention of the work of James Randi. Novella states of Moriarty \\"She is (most likely) just an old-school journalist who thinks of paranormal pieces as '\\"fluff\\"' pieces that don't require journalistic rigor\\". And that this segment could have run \\"thirty years ago with no change\\". In another segment Moriarty interviewed psychic Angela Dellafiora Ford, who claims that she \\"psychically tracked down fugitive drug smuggler Charlie Jordan in 1989\\". Nickell writes that Moriarty \\"simply takes Ford at her word\\" and \\"gushes\\" over her. Nickell states that Ford's claims are an example of '\\"retrofitting\\"' and incorrect. Center for Inquiry editor Kendrick Frazier wrote of his disappointment that the station of Murrow and Cronkite would air a pro-paranormal segment with Geller and a psychic detective. They also featured parapsychologist Dean Radin calling him a scientist which he is not. In a tweet the next day in response to criticism, Moriarty wrote '\\"We reported on government experiments with the paranormal ‚Äì supported by declassified Govt documents. We gave time to both those involved and scientists.\\"' Frazier responded that \\"Just because some part of the government initiated a bizarre little research program at some point in the past, that is not itself a validation of the claims it was studying.\\" Further research by CFI timed the segment and \\"found it more than 97 percent pro- paranormal and only 3 percent skeptical\\". In a press release, CFI called the CBS Sunday Morning segment a \\"regrettable lapse ... in the ... usually objective and reliable coverage\\". They called on the show to \\"take steps to correct the record\\" and to \\"provide a more truthful and scientifically rigorous view of this topic\\". Awards and nominations Kimberly Dozier and the crew of CBS Sunday Morning-The Way Home at the 67th Annual Peabody Awards The program won its first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Morning Program in 2013, beating out Today and Good Morning America in the category.

', sometimes called ', is a castle in Hiroshima, Japan that was the home of the daimy≈ç (feudal lord) of the Hiroshima han (fief). The castle was originally constructed in the 1590s, but was destroyed by the atomic bombing on August 6, 1945. The castle was rebuilt in 1958, a replica of the original that now serves as a museum of Hiroshima's history before World War II. History M≈çri Terumoto, one of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's council of Five Elders, built Hiroshima castle between 1589 and 1599. It was located on the delta of the Otagawa river. There was no Hiroshima city or town at the time, and the area was called Gokamura, meaning \\"five villages\\". Beginning in 1591, M≈çri Terumoto moved from Yoshida-K≈çriyama Castle and governed nine provinces from this castle, including much of what is now Shimane, Yamaguchi, Tottori, Okayama and Hiroshima Prefectures. When construction on the castle began, Gokamura was renamed Hiroshima, as a more impressive name was called for. \\"Hiro\\" was taken from ≈åe no Hiromoto, an ancestor of the M≈çri family, and \\"Shima\\" was taken from Fukushima Motonaga, who helped M≈çri Terumoto choose the castle site. Some accounts state that the name \\"Hiroshima\\", meaning \\"wide island\\", comes from the existence of several large islands in the delta of the Otagawa, near the castle's site. Following the battle of Sekigahara in 1600, M≈çri was forced out of the castle, retreating to Hagi in today's Yamaguchi Prefecture. Fukushima Masanori became the lord of Aki and Bingo Provinces (which today make up Hiroshima Prefecture) and of Hiroshima castle. However, the new Tokugawa shogunate forbade any castle construction without permission from Edo; this was part of how the shogunate kept the daimy≈çs from gaining power and overthrowing the shogunate. When Fukushima repaired the castle following a flood in 1619, he was dispatched to Kawanakajima in today's Nagano Prefecture. Asano Nagaakira then became lord of the castle. From 1619 until the abolition of the feudal system during the Meiji Restoration (1869), the Asano family were lords of Aki and Bingo Provinces. After the Meiji Restoration, the castle came to serve as a military facility, and the Imperial General Headquarters was based there during the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894‚Äì1895. The foundations of several of the GHQ outbuildings, just a few hundred paces from the castle's main tower, remain today. During the final months of World War II, the castle served as the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and Fifth Division, stationed there to deter the projected Allied invasion of the Japanese mainland. The castle was destroyed in the atomic bomb blast of August 6, 1945, and for many years, it was believed the castle structure was blown away by the explosion that destroyed Hiroshima, but newly discovered evidence suggests the explosion only destroyed the lower pillars of the castle, and the rest of it collapsed as a result.Junji Akechi, \\"New theory offered for collapse of Hiroshima Castle tower in the bombing\\" The present tower, constructed largely of concrete, was completed in 1958. =Daimy≈çs of Hiroshima= # 20px M≈çri Terumoto (1591‚Äì1600)*; 1,120,000 koku # 18px Fukushima Masanori (1600‚Äì1619); 498,223 koku # 20pxAsano Nagaakira (1619‚Äì1632); 426,500 koku** # 20pxAsano Mitsuakira (1632‚Äì1672) # 20pxAsano Tsunaakira (1672‚Äì1673) # 20pxAsano Tsunanaga (1673‚Äì1708) # 20pxAsano Yoshinaga (1708‚Äì1752) # 20pxAsano Munetsune (1752‚Äì1763) # 20pxAsano Shigeakira (1763‚Äì1799) # 20pxAsano Narikata (1799‚Äì1830) # 20pxAsano Naritaka (1831‚Äì1858) # 20pxAsano Yoshiteru (1858‚Äì1858) # 20pxAsano Nagamichi (1858‚Äì1869) # 20pxAsano Nagakoto (1869‚Äì1871) *The years listed are those in which the lord occupied Hiroshima castle, not the years of his life. **All of the lords after Asano Nagaakira enjoyed the same 426,500 koku. Structure Part of the reconstructed ninomaru Part of the reconstructed castle Map stone memorial The castle was originally constructed in wood, pine primarily, and had attached wings to the east and to the south. It was completed sometime between 1592 and 1599, and was designated a National Treasure in 1931. The reconstructed castle features the main tower (tenshu) only, which is made primarily of reinforced concrete. Its five floors stand above the stone foundation, which, in turn, is high off the ground. However, in 1994, a gate and a yagura in the ninomaru were re-constructed out of wood using the original methods. An excellent example of a hirajiro or flatlands (plains) castle, Hiroshima castle once had three concentric moats in addition to the Otagawa river to the west (now called the Hongawa), which provided an additional natural barrier. The two outer moats were filled in during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and much of what was once within the castle grounds is now modern urban area, including homes, schools, offices and shops. A number of secondary castle buildings, towers and turrets once stood, and a Shinto shrine called Hiroshima Gokoku Jinja is located within the innermost moat, having been moved there after 1945. Within the castle walls, three trees survived the atomic bombing: a eucalyptus and a willow at approximately 740 m from the hypocenter, and a holly approximately 935 m from the hypocenter. Both specimens are preserved just beyond the Honmaru. Also located inside the Honmaru is the concrete bunker from which the first radio broadcast out of Hiroshima following the atomic bombing was made.

It is located in the city of Gatineau, Quebec. In 2002, about 75% of the region's high school graduates had been admitted to the institution. As of 2012 there are over 5,000 students attending the college. Partnership The College of General and Vocational Education is affiliated with the ACCC, and CCAA. Campus The C√©gep provides teaching in French and consists of two separate, sister entities. The main campus, Gabrielle-Roy, is located on Boulevard de la Cit√©-des-Jeunes in the Hull sector. The second campus, Felix-Leclerc, is located in the Gatineau sector on Boulevard de la Gappe. There is also a third much smaller campus called Louis-Reboul located on Boulevard Sacr√©-Coeur in the downtown sector.  History  The institution of what would become the CEGEP de l'Outaouais was founded in 1967 when the Quebec government under the Union Nationale with Daniel Johnson, Sr. as premier, implemented a network of CEGEPs, a college educational level to replace classic courses that were abolished during the Quiet Revolution Era. During this time it incorporated several institutions that were previously under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church. It included the Institut de Technologie de Hull, the Coll√®ge classique Marguerite-D'Youville, for girls, the Coll√®ge classique Marie- M√©diatrice, for boys, the √âcole normale de Hull, the Institut familiale de Hull and finally the √âcole des Infirmi√®res de l'Hopital Sacr√©-Coeur. It was known until 1975 as the CEGEP de Hull, then as the CEGEP de l'Outaouais up until 1984, when it changed to Coll√®ge de l'Outaouais. In 2004, the name C√©gep de l'Outaouais was restored. Programs The Province of Quebec awards a Diploma of Collegial Studies for two types of programs: two years of pre- university studies or three years of vocational (technical) studies. The pre- university programs, which take two years to complete, cover the subject matters which roughly correspond to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada and one year of university with a focus on the student's chosen field. As a result, students who complete a Diploma of Collegial Studies usually only take 3 years to complete a bachelor's degree. The technical programs, which take three-years to complete, applies to students who wish to pursue a skill trade. In addition Continuing education and services to business are provided. The C√©gep has several pre-university programs as well as technical programs. Among pre-university courses includes : humanities (three branches), natural sciences, \\"sciences, letters & arts\\" and \\"arts and letters\\". Technical programs includes, police techniques, computer sciences, multimedia, administration, office automation, dental hygiene, health sciences, documentation, mechanical engineering, interior design, etc. Most technical courses are offered at the Gabrielle-Roy campus only, while most pre-university programs are offered at both Gabrielle-Roy and Felix-Leclerc. While French is the main teaching language at the institution, there are also courses offered in English, Spanish, German and Mandarin. Most of them are given in the Arts and Letters program. Sports The C√©gep de l'Outaouais' varsity teams are called the Griffons. The C√©gep has teams in men's and women's volleyball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's badminton, men's and women's soccer, and most recently football. The Gabrielle-Roy campus has several sporting facilities including two gymnasium, a swimming pool and a weightlifting room.

It is home to the University of Guelph Ridgetown Campus. It has a 2016 population of 3,002 and is one of many small farming communities in Chatham- Kent. The town motto is, \\"Agriculture at its best‚Äù. Its landmarks includes the Ridgetown Water Tower and Blake's Trap House on Main. History Named for the ridge where the town is located. The ridge divides the north and south watersheds of the area. Post office dates from 1853. Ridgetown was incorporated as a village in 1875 with just over 2,000 citizens. In 1975, with well over 3,220 residents, Ridgetown celebrated its centennial. Residents celebrated by dressing in 1875 costumes, conducting beard-growing contests, barbecues, and other activities. The Rotary Club of Ridgetown bought the Galbraith house and formed the Ridgetown Historical Society. The Ridge House Museum is now a living history museum that gets many visitors. The name of Ridgetown came from it being situated on a gravel ridge, a remnant of the glacier age. The families Marsh, Mitton, Watson, Scane and Colby were the first settlers. William \\"Daddy\\" Marsh, who was known for making up far-fetched stories, once said that at York (now Toronto) where they were from, he climbed up a tall tree, saw the ridge and the plentiful land and said that was the place to be. Today, with 3002 residents (2016 Canadian Census), Ridgetown proudly shares the outlying areas that produce major crops such as soybeans, corn, wheat, grains, and field vegetables. The water supply is drawn from a number of deep wells around the town and is not connected to a piped system from a lake or river. The railway tracks of the Canada Southern/Michigan Central/New York Central and Detroit River and Lake Erie/Pere Marquette/C&O; railways used to run through Ridgetown, though these are both gone now ‚Äì the last steam train through Ridgetown was in 2005. The railways formed an important part of Ridgetown's heritage, because there had been competition between Ridgetown and Morpeth (now a small hamlet on Highway 3 - Talbot Trail) to get them. Ridgetown 'won' and expanded, to the everlasting cost of Morpeth which had to that point been advantageously situated on the major east-west highway in the area. Climate and geography The climate is mild, being moderated by Lake Erie which is seven kilometres to the south. Summer days can be hot and humid. In winter, Ridgetown is not in the snowbelt which begins near London, Ontario, hence snow accumulation is generally less in comparison. In 2007, plans to install a line of electricity-generating wind turbines several kilometres to the south of town, along Highway 3 between Morpeth and Blenheim, were in development. This was one of four wind turbine projects approved for Chatham-Kent in 2007.http://www.talbotwindfarm.com/ Ridgetown is located in the middle of a low morainic ridge. Originally under water, in the melting of the last ice age, the \\"Ridgetown island\\" appeared. The ridge is approximately 13,000 years old.Dreimanis, A \\"Lake Arkona-Whittlesey and Post- Warren Radiocarbon Dates from Ridgetown Island in Southwestern Ontario\\",1966 Education Ridgetown has 3 schools. The high school in Ridgetown, Ridgetown District High School (RDHS), has just under 300 students in grades 7-12. In recent years, declining enrolment made it difficult for the Lambton Kent District School Board (LKDSB) to ensure a future for RDHS. As a result, vocal community groups have banded together to fight for and ensure the viability of the high school. If the high school were to close, students would have to be bussed to Chatham city schools. In 2006, RDHS became involved with a trial of video schooling - tying three area high schools together with one teacher. RDHS made history in 2005 when the Drama Club entered the Sears Drama Festival with the play \\"The Empty Chair\\" written by Tim Kelly. The Drama Club worked from the summer of 2004 until performance night in February 2005 at the Chatham Cultural Centre. Out of 12 high schools from across the district, Ridgetown moved on to the Regional level for the first time in nearly 20 years. The elementary schools (St. Michael Catholic School, Naahii Ridge Public School ) serve a wide area of eastern Chatham-Kent, with many students being bussed in from the countryside. Naahii Ridge Public School is also operated by the LKDSB. St. Michael is under the jurisdiction of the St. Clair Catholic District School Board. The former Ridgetown College has been part of the University of Guelph since 1997 and is now University of Guelph, Ridgetown Campus. It is a venue for OAC- the Ontario Agricultural College. About 600 students presently attend 2 and 3-year courses on agriculture, veterinary technology, graphical information systems, horticulture and environmental management. Industry and small business Ridgetown has a thriving manufacturing industry, mainly serving the automotive market, which employ hundreds of local and area people. Martinrea, KSR International, Waltron Trailers, Trak Tool Machines, and Challenger Pallet are the larger plants. Tens of smaller service businesses thrive in the area, including many long- established and unique stores in the downtown area.

He first appeared onscreen from 28 December 1998 and remained in the series until 1 March 2002. Introduced by series producer Matthew Robinson, the character Steve was a shady businessman who originally came into Albert Square to buy the local Market Cellar club ‚Äì which he then renovated and later renamed the E20. He soon became one of the show's primary villains when the character's first major storyline saw Steve murder his old flame Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor) during the opening night of his E20 nightclub on Valentine's Day 1999, after which he ended up framing his DJ employee Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom) for the crime. The eventual episode in which Matthew enacted revenge on Steve drew in outstanding viewing figures and brought a storyline that had gripped the nation to a close. Afterwards, Steve embarked on a dangerous feud with his nemesis: Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). The ensuing conflict between them grew intensifying as Steve later became sworn enemies with Phil's best-friend-turned-hardman adversary, Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), which had continued to develop in the case of both Dan and Phil having respective connections to Steve's girlfriend and future wife: Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). Additionally, Steve contributed to his significant interaction with other members of the Mitchell family by establishing an antagonistic business partnership with Phil's brother Grant (Ross Kemp); sleeping with their younger sister Sam (Kim Medcalf); employing the siblings' cousin, Billy (Perry Fenwick), to work for him as his errand boy; clashing with Phil's adolescent godson Jamie (Jack Ryder); and sparking a quarrel with the family's patriarch, Peggy (Barbara Windsor), over his managing stake of her public house called The Queen Victoria. In 2001, the character was involved in one of the show's greatest and most memorable storylines of all- time when Steve became a prime suspect in \\"Who Shot Phil?\\". The epic whodunit scenario began with Steve marrying Mel on the day of Phil's shooting and ultimately concluded with Dan kidnapping Mel for ransom against both Steve and Phil, after the pair had worked together to implicate Dan behind the shooting ‚Äì even though the culprit was earlier revealed to be Phil's ex-girlfriend and Mel's closest companion: Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). It was then Martin Kemp quit the series after his contract to the show had expired, and his final scenes were aired on 1 March 2002 ‚Äì the first anniversary of both Steve's wedding and Phil's shooting. In that episode, Steve made a last-ditch attempt to settle his score with Phil by fleeing the country and starting anew to America with his and Lisa's infant daughter Louise ‚Äì which triggered a fierce car chase between the two archenemies that ended with Steve being killed after he crashed his car and consequently died in a vehicle explosion, though not before he helped Phil save Louise in his last moments; the character's funeral aired on 11 March 2002 and his onscreen widow Mel later departed a month later on 12 April that year in light of Steve's death. It was thereafter alleged that producers had intentionally killed off Steve as \\"revenge\\" for Martin Kemp leaving the show in order to make the transition from the BBC to rival station ITV. Nevertheless, Kemp received multiple award nominations and victories for his critically acclaimed portrayal of Steve Owen. Storylines Steve Owen made his first appearance in Walford ‚Äì a fictionalized borough in East London ‚Äì He buys the Market Cellar club in the borough's local community, Albert Square, before renovating the premises and then renaming it the E20; Steve thereafter sets up his new club's opening date on Valentine's Day in the coming new year. While making preparations for the opening night of his E20 nightclub, Steve romantically bonds with Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite) ‚Äì who had recently moved into the square. Their relationship becomes threatened, however, when Steve's former girlfriend Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan- Taylor) unexpectedly turns up and tries to come between them on numerous occasions. She soon entraps Steve by sleeping with him and then making sure that Mel and everyone else knows about it. Steve later pays Saskia to leave Walford and never bother him again. On the opening night of his E20 nightclub, however, Saskia confronts Steve in his office and it soon alleges that she had previously aborted their unborn child because of him; with Steve clarifying in his argument with Saskia that he didn't want them to have a baby. Saskia, blaming Steve for her abortion, vows to make him suffer and attacks Steve after he is unable to get her out of the club. She hits Steve on the head with a champagne bottle and then tries to strangle him with his tie. Moments later, Steve's DJ employee Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom) walks in on the situation and attempts to help Steve ‚Äì which only prompts Saskia to go for Matthew until Steve attempts to get her off him and she again proceeds to strangle him with his tie once more. On the verge of being strangled to death and in self- defence, Steve picks up a heavy marble ashtray and hits her over the head with it ‚Äì killing her instantly. Matthew tries to call the police when it becomes clear to him and his boss that Saskia is dead, but Steve stops him and instead forces Matthew to cover-up her death by burying her body to Epping Forest. For the next few months, Steve torments Matthew is his newfound resolve to keep his DJ employee in check regarding the event of Saskia's death. This continues when Saskia's corpse is discovered months later, and Matthew later confines to his girlfriend Teresa di Marco (Leila Birch) about the incident. They later attempt to abscond the country for a fresh start together, but Steve discovers their plan and catches up to them. The police are soon called in when Matthew, nervous and shaken about his witnessing to the crime, confesses to the police about the incident; he and Steve are later charged for murder and manslaughter in relation to Saskia's murder. In the build-up to their jointed trial, Steve and Matthew are both remanded in custody and they hostility grows from that point onwards. Steve also receives a number of visits from his sister Jackie (Race Davies) as well as updates on the E20 management from Teresa's brother Beppe (Michael Greco), who has gone into partnership with Steve after losing his job as a police officer, while Matthew gains support from local resident Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) over his innocence behind Saskia's murder. After Steve and Matthew each give their statements about the circumstances behind Saskia's death, the trial ends with the pair receiving different verdicts on the manslaughter charge after both are found not guilty of murder; Steve is fully acquitted from his manslaughter charge while Matthew is found guilty of manslaughter and later sentenced to seven years in prison. Steve later attempt to settle his freedom in the square once more, but he finds himself publicly ostracized around the community for framing Matthew behind the crime ‚Äì up to the point when Matthew's friend Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) constantly brands him a \\"murderer\\" while both Mark and his close friend, Dot Cotton (June Brown), lecture him for his supposed lack of responsibility. When Steve attempts to have a drink in The Queen Victoria public house and nearly all the pundits begin to turn on him, he confronts them for the way how they've been treating him and describes how he killed Saskia in self-defense and that Matthew was never meant to get involved in the first place. Beppe, who is one of the few people to stand by Steve following the latter's trial, promptly buys a drink for Steve as everyone begins to realize that Steve's murder of Saskia was really in self-defense. In the events between Saskia's murder and his subsequent trial over her death, Steve instigates a conflict with two of the square's local hardmen called the \\"Mitchell Brothers\\" ‚Äì up to the point where he gradually becomes archenemies with the eldest brother, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), and constantly antagonizes his sibling Grant (Ross Kemp) in the course of their business partnership. In the latter case, Steve repeatedly clashes with Grant when the two work together with illegitimate businesswoman Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha) in her bid to carry out her expansion plans around the square; with Annie managing the businesses that her entrepreneurial father, George (Paul Moriarty), has assigned her to takeover on his behalf. As the trio begin managing the square's local gym, Steve infiltrates Grant and Annie by hiring staff without either of their consent. This continues when Grant throws out one of the guests for causing trouble, and it turns out that the troublemaker is one of Steve's visitors. Steve later attempts to have Grant fired for not taking his orders seriously, but Grant instead quits and the business ends up floundering ‚Äì which causes Annie to leave the square for good and sell his remaining share of her ownership to Grant. Later on, Steve confronts Grant just as the latter is preparing to join Phil on a criminal job and declares that they have \\"unfinished business\\" over their broken partnership. In a sarcastic remark \\"Oh yeah, so we haven't?\\", Grant punches Steve before leaving to do the job with Phil. This would be the last time Steve sees Grant, as the latter's heist with Phil ends with the Mitchell Brothers driving their getaway car into the River Thames and Grant is presumed dead; he is later revealed to be alive and ends up leaving the country to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil with his daughter Courtney. Following Grant's departure, Steve turns his attention to Phil for the management of his business. He later joins the Mitchell Brothers' younger sister, Sam (Danniella Westbrook), on a trip to Brighton with Mel alongside Mark and two other guests: Sam's ex- husband Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and his troublesome sister Janine (Charlie Brooks). During the trip, Steve seeks to reconcile with Mel even when she is set to marry Phil's stepson Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) after her relationship with Steve ended due to the Saskia impact. However, Mel soon recoups her relationship with Steve after she dumps Ian for discovering that he lied to her and the square about his little daughter Lucy (Casey Anne Rothery) dying of cancer when in actuality she had been fine all along. During the Millennium Eve ceremony on New Year's Eve 1999, Steve is surprised to see Matthew in the midst of celebrations; Matthew's conviction has been quashed on appeal and because of his good behaviour over the course of his wrongful imprisonment. For the next month in early 2000, Steve grows paranoid when Matthew alleges that he intents to settle his score with his former boss for good. This eventually culminates with the two having a showdown on the week before the first anniversary of Saskia's death. Matthew confronts Steve and attempts to blackmail him in giving him ¬£10,000 as compensation for what he put him through over the incident. Steve initially refuses, but seemingly relents after Matthew presents the extent of his work to get revenge on Steve as well as explaining all of its cover-up ‚Äì thus ensuring that Steve cannot establish prove to anything that Matthew has done against him ever since they crossed paths on New Year's Eve 1999. Steve then brandishes a handgun and tries to intimidate Matthew, only to learn that the DJ employee had earlier removed all the bullets from his handgun. When Steve attempts to attack Matthew, he gets knocked out and held captive in his chair. Matthew then claims to have killed Saskia's sister Claudia Fielding (Romla Walker), to which Steve at first dismisses until he is later presented with evidence that appears to not only claim otherwise ‚Äì but also implicates Steve behind the crime in the same manner as he previously entrapped Matthew as the perpetrator behind Saskia's death. As Steve breaks down over how the situation has caught up with him, Matthew proceeds to chuck petrol over him and threatens to incinerate him. It is at this point that Steve is reduced to a desperate, helpless wreck as he tries to reason with Matthew. His pleas, however, fall on deaf ears when Matthew refuses to listen to Steve and prepares to set fire to the E20 ‚Äì even when Teresa and Jackie arrive to try and also reason with him. Matthew then drops the light on the petrol, but nothing happens apart from Steve screaming out in fear. Matthew then reveals to Steve that the \\"petrol\\" is actually water and that Claudia was never dead or even involved in his plan in the first place, as well as the fact that he just wanted to show Steve up for what he really is. With his revenge against Steve fulfilled, Matthew takes the ¬£10,000 and leaves the E20 after bidding farewell to Teresa; he soon leaves the square and is never heard or seen ever again in Walford. After enduring the full extent of Matthew's revenge, Steve becomes depressed and ends up getting himself addicted to drugs. He takes up the advice of Ricky and Janine's stepfather, Pat Butcher (Pam St Clement), to leave the square for a while in order to overcome his drug addiction. As Steve embarks on his temporarily leave from the square, Jackie joins him after failing to mend her broken relationship with Beppe and Teresa's brother Gianni (Marc Bannerman); she doesn't return to Walford afterwards and is never seen again. By then, Mel has began romancing with Phil's best-friend and business partner Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). This soon ends, however, after Mel tells Phil that Dan had secretly reported him to the police for operating a motor scam with his stepfather Frank (Mike Reid) and their colleague Roy Evans (Tony Caunter). On the night after Phil swindled Dan's ownership of the Queen Vic, Steve returns to the square upon overcoming his addiction and witnesses Dan threatening Mel. He soon intervenes and threatens Dan, who then leaves just as Steve begins to comfort Mel over her ordeal. When the situation continues as Dan begins to harass Mel with threatening phone calls and even breaking into her house at one point, Steve summons Phil's cousin Billy (Perry Fenwick) and orders him to locate Dan's whereabouts; Billy had been working for Steve ever since Grant left the square and in Steve's bid to challenge Phil in their business competition. Billy soon learns where Dan is, and Steve goes to confront him in his flat. Dan is at first unfazed by Steve's threat into leaving Walford, but Steve changes his mind by brandishing his handgun and threatening to kill Dan unless he calls Mel to apologize; Dan complies and he seemingly leaves the square for good. Afterwards, Steve informs Mel that Dan has been taken care off and that he won't be bothering her again. When Phil learns that Steve had forced Dan to leave the square, the two rivals call a truce and they later work together in some businesses around the square; with Phil even giving Steve a stake of ownership at The Queen Vic. Their potential friendship quickly reverts into a two-man feud, however, when Phil persuades Beppe to have him become the E20's major shareholder without Steve's consent. When Steve asserts that Mel is partly to blame after noticing the quality time she and Phil have been spending time together, he confronts her about it in the pub until Phil tells him to back off. When Steve dismisses his threats, Phil punches him and the two end up having a brutal fight that ends with Phil forcing Steve out of the pub and Steve promising retaliation. Steve later apologizes to Mel after Christmas Day 2000 and soon proposes to her, which she gladly accepts. However, Steve is unaware that Mel had a one-night stand with Phil on Christmas Day. They nevertheless begin planning their wedding in early 2001, which becomes further complicated when Dan returns to the square. Steve discovers this after finding Dan overpowering Billy in his office, and he orders Billy to leave before turning his attention to Dan. It is at this point that Steve and Dan have formed a rivalry in the ensuing course of their respective feuds with Phil himself. This is proven when Dan tells Steve that his reasons for coming back to square are to deal with Phil, to which Steve dismisses by reminding Dan of the last warning he gave him and again threatens him should he ever come in between him and Mel again. Dan then warns Steve to not let Mel \\"take him for a mug\\" just as she allegedly did to him and Ian, before offering him a handshake. Steve rejects this and threateningly tells Dan to get out of his office, which prompts Dan to tell Steve that he'll regret telling him that before leaving. By the time Steve's wedding to Mel has emerged, his suspicions about her and Phil prompt him to secretly record a conversation between them ‚Äì which Steve remotely overhears by using his phone. Steve's suspicions are eventually confirmed when Phil tells Mel to admit that she enjoyed sleeping with him, and she reluctantly responds to this as Steve listens through. On the day of their wedding, Steve becomes aggravated when Phil turns up uninvited and proceeds to woo Steve's mother Barbara (Sheila Hancock) ‚Äì who herself has also turned up against Steve's expectations ‚Äì by striking up a conversation with her. The situation escalates at the E20 reception, where Steve confronts Phil for getting his mother involved and Phil tauntingly mocks him in front of her and the remaining guests. Later on that night, local taxi driver Charlie Slater (Derek Martin) prepares to drive the newly wedded couple to their honeymoon. As they begin to leave, Steve claims that he needs to check on Billy at the E20 and momentarily leaves Mel ‚Äì though it becomes clear that Steve appears intent on getting revenge on Phil for the trouble he has caused him. This could've been a motive for Steve when Phil gets shot by an unseen assailant, shortly before Steve returns and proceeds to go to his holiday with Mel. When the pair return from their honeymoon, they hear about Phil's shooting and Steve is promptly implicated as the prime suspect. It soon transpires that the weapon that hospitalized Phil was Steve's handgun, which has gone missing ever since the incident occurred just at the end of Steve and Mel's wedding. Steve is later arrested when police detective DCI Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton) and her unit gather evidence of his implication, most notably his motive for knowing about Mel sleeping with Phil on Christmas 2000. Upon hearing of this, both Phil's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) and his young godson Jamie (Jack Ryder) constantly accuse Steve of committing the crime. Steve insistently proclaims his innocence behind Phil's shooting and is forced to deal with Jamie on multiple occasions, particularly as Jamie dislikes Steve due to being Matthew's best-friend and having previously testified against Steve for Saskia's murder. Steve later visits Phil in the hospital and threatens him should Mel ever come between their differences again. Later that evening, Steve receives a visit from Dan and is again confronted by Jamie moments later. When Steve tauntingly tells Jamie that Phil is a liar, Jamie punches Steve and they fight when Steve punches Jamie back ‚Äì which is quickly broken up by Robbie's sister Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) and Dan himself. Jamie demands Steve to get out of the square for good, but Steve refuses and again protests his innocence. However, when Phil recovers and discharges himself from the hospital that night, Steve is indeed proven innocent when Phil ends up confronting the real culprit: his former girlfriend and Mel's best-friend, Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). Shortly after confronting Lisa and forgiving her for shooting him, as Phil had drove her to it due to his mistreatment towards her since over a year ago, Phil resolves to implicate the crime on both Steve and Dan in order to rid himself of his two archenemies who each threaten his position as the square's reigning top dog. He initially plans to incriminate Steve after seeing him and Mel together in the pub, but then decides to frame Dan after the latter begins extorting money from him and Jamie. When Steve learns about this from Billy, he goes to visit Phil and witnesses him finishing his meeting with Dan's former crime boss Ritchie Stringer (Gareth Hunt). That afternoon, Steve begins to taunt Phil into leaving Walford after recalling on what Dan has been doing to him and Jamie. However, Steve's mood changes when Phil reveals that his handgun ‚Äì which Lisa used to shoot Phil and had kept in possession in between after Steve's wedding and before Phil's recovery ‚Äì is now in Ritchie's possession as part of his plan to frame Dan, whom Steve insists Phil incriminate after assuming that Phil intents to frame him for the crime. Phil soon plans to lure Steve to The Archies the following night, despite Mel's protests. Steve goes to meet Phil there anyway, but promptly leaves after witnessing Dan holding Phil at gunpoint. Moments later, the police arrive and arrest Dan under the suspicion of shooting Phil and unlawful possession of Steve's firearm. Dan is subsequently charged for the crime and Phil soon asks Steve to help him ensure that Dan would get sent down for the shooting; Steve agrees when it becomes clear that both he and Phil would both find themselves comfortable be well- ridden of their common nemesis, as well as Mel's previous tormentor. Before the events of Dan's trial, Mel alerts Steve that his mother expects a visit from him about her condition to her terminal heart disease. At first Steve doesn't want to visit Barbara and refuses to explain his reasons to Mel, but he eventually changes his mind after having a heart-to-heart with local neighbour Natalie Price (Lucy Speed) about their relationship progressions; with Natalie confining to Steve about how her past troubles have been overcome thanks to her marriage with Roy's only son, Barry (Shaun Williamson). Afterwards, Steve visits his mother in her flat and it quickly becomes clear that she is in critical condition due to her terminal heart disease. It is then revealed that Barbara had previously abused Steve when he was a child, and that she never appeared to care for either him or Jackie. When Steve confronts her about her past behaviour, she sarcastically defends her actions by claiming that his late father Richard had left her to bring up him and Jackie with no money. Steve reluctantly goes to call an ambulance as his mother's condition appears to escalate, but she refuses and instead demands Steve give her a kiss. Steve call an ambulance and asks him to kiss her. He gives her a peck on the forehead but she asks for a kiss on the lips. When he leans forward, she grabs him and gives him an extremely passionate kiss, telling him he is an attractive man. Disgusted and traumatized, Steve furiously disowns his mother and leaves after calling her sick. Mel is later informed that Barbara has died and tells Steve about it, but he reacts indifferently and refuses to attend her funeral; Mel later ends up going to the funeral on her own. She subsequently confronts Steve for his callousness over his mother's death, but then sympathizes with her husband when he is forced to explain how his mother neglected and abused him during his childhood. Following his mother's funeral, Steve proceeds to contribute with Phil's plot and gives false evidence in his own testimony against Dan; however, the plan ends unsuccessfully when Dan is found not guilty by the jury in his verdict. Dan is later released and, assuming that Steve was the one who shot Phil and that the pair have conspired to get him sent to prison, resolves to get revenge on his two arch-rivals. His first act is to force Billy into giving him leverage over Steve and Phil. When Dan threatens to hurt Billy, the latter reluctantly exposes Phil's one-night stand with Mel and this causes Dan to realize that Mel is the link between Steve and Phil's rivalry. Dan later kidnaps Mel and proceeds to hold her ransom in an abandoned flat. When Steve learns about this from Dan in a taunting phone call, he alerts Phil and the two form an uneasy alliance in order to save Mel from their enemy. Soon enough, Dan contacts Steve and demands that both he and Phil deliver ¬£100,000 each to him in exchange for Mel's safety ‚Äì up to the point where he even threatens her life in a bid to get his two rivals to compel to his demand. After the pair manage to obtain the ¬£200,000, Steve and Phil argue about who will be exchanging the money for Mel and whether Dan needs to be taken down ‚Äì with Steve just wanting Mel to come home safe while Phil is determined to finish things with Dan in order to stop him from making lives harder for them as well as Jamie and Peggy themselves. Just as Steve goes to deliver the money, however, Dan calls Phil and orders him ‚Äì not Steve ‚Äì to make the exchange for Mel. In compliance, Phil takes the money and goes to the flat where Dan is holding Mel captive to make the exchange on his own. There, he momentarily disarms Dan and prepares to kill him; however, he fails when Dan ends up overpowering Phil after Mel causes a distraction. Dan then flees Walford with his ¬£200,000 ransom money, but not after he drops Mel off near the square and she thereupon returns to Steve in his house. Although Steve is relieved that Mel has been unharmed throughout her ordeal with Dan, she later confronts her husband over all the things that Dan told her throughout the scenario. Mel had learned about Steve had cheated on her amid the events of his mother's funeral, as he slept with a blonde woman named Karen ‚Äì which Billy later found out about and was forced to tell Dan as the latter extorted leverage against Steve and Phil. Furthermore, she discovers that Steve had secretly bought the pub from Phil's ex-lover Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) without ever consulting to his wife about it. It was then that Mel, after approaching Phil about Dan's theories, comes to learn about all of Steve's lies and criminal activities. Outraged by the extent of his deception, Mel retaliates against her husband by burning down his club and then chucking her wedding ring at Steve; she then departs Walford to clear her mind over Steve's criminality. Steve's demise in 2002 In light of Dan's revenge and Mel's departure, Steve ends up having financial problems; his insurance policy is invalidated due to the fact that he neglected to mention both his involvement in Saskia's death and an incident from his past, the latter of which he attempted to cut costs by illegally importing duty-free wines from France. To sort out his monetary difficulties, he organises a robbery to help finance the renovation of the club and arranges for some of old friends to partake in the job; Steve reluctantly invites Billy into the heist as well. After assembling his crew and making preparations, Steve plans to steal money from a wealthy businessman named Alan. During the heist, Steve attempts to trap Alan's mistress Jan Sherwood (Cherie Lunghi) and they end up having a one-night stand together; Steve and Jan split the money that was stolen, fooling Steve's gang into believing Jan had taken it all. Afterwards, Steve gives Billy his share from the job and tracks down Mel in his plan to win her back. This nearly fails as Mel begins to date Barry's half-brother Nathan Williams (Doug Allen) upon returning to Walford, but Steve evilly ends up wooing Mel. It is at this point that Steve and Phil have escalated their own rivalry with each other. By the time 2002 has emerged, Steve infuriates Phil by pretending that he slept with Sharon while they were recouped their old relationship. Phil responds by attacking Steve and ends up getting arrested, up to the point where he is charged for assault. In retaliation, Phil forces Billy to plant drugs in Steve's club and Steve is in turn arrested ‚Äì though he is released without charge. Steve then pays Jamie to smash the Queen Vic after learning that his companionship with Phil had deteriorated. Later on, Steve further antagonizes Phil by sleeping with Sam (now played by Kim Medcalf). When Phil learns about the heist Steve perpetuated a couple of months ago, he arranges for Steve to be confronted by the same people who he owes money to. Steve instead plans for him and Mel to leave Walford and start anew in the United States together. She agrees and the couple subsequently invite both Lisa and Mark, who have are now engaged ever since Lisa ended her relationship with Phil, to join them ‚Äì before Steve later convinces Lisa to also take her and Phil's infant daughter, Louise (Rachel Cox), along with their trip. On the day of the first anniversary to both Steve's wedding and Phil's shooting, trouble emerges when Mark is unable to go due to his HIV condition and Lisa believes the plan is falling apart. When Steve plans to tie-up his loose ends in order to put his escape plan into motion, he convinces Mel to look after Lisa while he heads off. However, Phil soon discovers the plan and calls Steve to demand that he return Louise to him; Steve refuses and taunts Phil before hanging up. After confronting Mel over her husband's whereabouts, Phil catches up to Steve and the two engage in an intense vehicular car chase that ends with Steve ‚Äì just as he attempts to answer Mel's alerting phone call ‚Äì crashing into a wall after a tire bursts from his car, which ends up colliding into a parked motorbike; this instantly totals his car and triggers a fire. When Phil arrives in that moment, Steve helps him rescue Louise by passing the baby to Phil ‚Äì who then rushes her to safety just as Steve finds himself unable to get out of the car. Steve then repeatedly calls Phil out to save him when it becomes clear that his car is about to explode. Phil eventually relents after a moment of hesitation and he begins to rush back to save Steve from his burning car, but the car suddenly explodes in a fireball ‚Äì killing Steve and Phil watches on as Steve's reign of terror at Walford is finally over. During her offscreen time away from Walford, Mel ends up giving birth to Steve's child ‚Äì which turns out to be a boy and she thereupon names her son Hunter. Over a decade later in 2018, Hunter (played by Charlie Winter) is introduced to Walford when Mel returns to the square with him. It thereupon discloses that Hunter, who displays similar tendencies to his father. Soon enough, Hunter ends up dating Louise (now played by Tilly Keeper) and their relationship leads him to discover the events behind their own father's car chase; Phil later describes the events of Steve's death to Hunter, who soon resolves to helping Mel reopen the E20 in tribute to the father that he never got to knew about. In 2019, Steve's first and last crimes are separately recounted when Hunter kills Mel's husband Ray Kelly (Sean Mahon). Two months later after her son's death, Mel ends up getting killed in a road collision at the climax of her car chase with Sharon ‚Äì who was married to Phil throughout that point. Ironically, Mel's death mirrors Steve's own demise from his car chase with Phil 17 years prior. Development =Relationship with Mel Healy= In an interview in June 2000, Kemp discussed the relationship between Steve and Mel: \\"Steve's convinced Mel will make his life complete. She kept him going during all the bad times and now he's determined to have her. It's true of a lot of guys who get into trouble, they hang their hat on one idea and that keeps them sane [...] there's a driving force that kept them going while they were [in prison]. And often that's a woman. You know from those tender moments when Mel came to visit Steve [in prison] that she was the thing that kept him going, and he won't stop til he gets her back.\\" Eventually the couple were shown to marry in the soap in March 2001, despite a revelation that Mel had strayed with Steve's nemesis Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Tamzin Outhwaite explained, \\"With Ian, Mel was the one who didn't want to go through with it. This time around Mel is the one who is apprehensive, hoping Steve will be there for her. If he isn't, she has no reason to stay in Walford. This really is make or break time for her.\\" The wedding night was a precursor to one of the soap's most publicised storylines, Who Shot Phil?, where Phil was gunned down by an unknown assailant and, due to Mel's infidelity, Steve became one of the prime suspects for the murder attempt, though he transpired to be a red herring. Discussing Mel and Steve's wedding, Outhwaite said, \\"Even though this wedding with Steve has got as much controversy as Mel's last one [with Ian], it feels more true. The characters seem more suited and it's not a big, white wedding, it's a low-key register office thing.\\" 17 million viewers watched the wedding. In August 2001, EastEnders began airing a 4th weekly episode. The storyline to mark the occasion centered around Mel, her husband Steve, his archenemy Phil, and their common nemesis Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). After Phil and Steve wrongfully framed Dan for Phil's shooting, Dan sought revenge by kidnapping Mel and demanding a ransom. An EastEnders insider reportedly told the Daily Mirror, \\"This has [been] one of the most dramatic storylines we have ever filmed. Dan has vowed to get even with Phil and Steve for framing him over the shooting. Kidnapping Mel kills two birds with one stone. Although Mel and Phil have had their differences, he still harbors feelings for her.\\" As part of the storyline, Outhwaite, as Mel, was tied up to a radiator in a council flat. Outhwaite commented, \\"They offered to untie my wrists between scenes, but I said no so I could feel what it was really like. My wrists were raw by the end of it and I was exhausted, but that was the challenge I wanted.\\" =Departure= On 26 July 2001, it was announced that Kemp had decided to leave EastEnders and that he was to move from the BBC to rival station ITV. He said of his decision: \\"I have had a wonderful time at EastEnders and I will be very sad to leave, but I feel that its time to move on.\\" It was reported that EastEnders producers decided to kill off his character as \\"revenge\\" for how the situation was handled. In 2006, Kemp ruled out a return to the show, saying he stayed for too long. However, in 2009, he expressed a wish to return, saying \\"Working on EastEnders was the best job I ever had. I want the producers to ring me up and get me back on the show. Steve was blown up, but I could come back as his evil twin!\\" He also said he was happy that he had a dramatic exit. Reception Kemp's portrayal of Steve saw him nominated for several awards, many of which he won. He won in the \\"Most Popular Actor\\" category at the 2000 National Television Awards and was nominated again the next year. He won \\"Best Actor\\" at the Inside Soap Awards in 2001 and \\"Best Soap Actor\\" at the TV Quick Awards three years running, from 2000 to 2002. At The British Soap Awards, he was nominated for \\"Best Actor\\" and the character for \\"Villain of the Year\\" in 1999, winning the latter in 2000. He went on to win \\"Best Actor\\" at the 2001 and 2002 ceremonies. Additionally, Steve's car crash was nominated for \\"Spectacular Scene of the Year\\" and \\"Best Exit\\" in 2002.

There are other stories and legends, but no authoritative evidence or references are known. The tune is sometimes claimed to be written by the famous harpist [O'Carolan], who lived some years later. However, there is no reference in the Bunting collection of O Carolan‚Äôs music. Nor should Rory Dall O'Cahan be confused with another blind poet at around the same time, Rory 'Dall' Morrison. A number of apocryphal stories have circulated about the circumstances of the tune's composition; further details can be seen at Andrew Kuntz's The Fiddler's Companion.The Fiddler's Companion is a huge encyclopedia of fiddle tunes from the Celtic, British and American traditions, created by Andrew Kuntz.

The film was released in the United States by Universal Studios on a double bill with The Projected Man (1967). The idea for the film came when the producer Richard Gordon read Gerry Fernback's screenplay The Night the Silicates Came. Gordon partnered with Tom Blakey of Planet Films to produce the film.John Hamilton, The British Independent Horror Film 1951-70 Hemlock Books 2013 p 154-157 It was shot in rural England using naturalistic colours. It provides one of the last significant examples of a horror film plot, common in the 1950s, in which a horrific threat introduced by a scientist is resolved by others using scientific measures. Plot Double feature poster of Island of Terror and The Projected Man On the remote Petrie's Island off the east coast of Ireland a farmer, Ian Bellows, goes missing and his wife contacts the local constabulary. Constable John Harris finds Bellows dead in a cave without a single bone in his body and fetches the island's physician, Dr Reginald Landers, but Landers is unable to determine what happened. He journeys to the mainland to seek the help of a noted London pathologist, Dr Brian Stanley. Stanley too is unable even to hypothesise what could have happened, so both men seek out Dr David West, an expert on bones and bone diseases. Although Stanley and Landers interrupt West's quiet evening at home with the wealthy jetsetter Toni Merrill, West is intrigued by the problem and so agrees to accompany the two doctors back to Petrie's Island to examine the corpse. In order for them to reach the island that much faster, Merrill offers the use of her father's private helicopter in exchange for the three men allowing her to come along on the adventure. Once back at Petrie's Island, Merrill's father's helicopter is forced to return to the mainland so he can use it, leaving the foursome effectively stranded on Petrie until the helicopter can return. West and Stanley learn that a group of oncology researchers led by Dr Lawrence Phillips, seeking a cure for cancer, have a secluded castle laboratory on the island. Paying a visit to Phillips' lab reveals that he and his colleagues are just as dead (and boneless) as Ian Bellows. Reasoning that whatever it is must have begun in that lab, West, Stanley and Landers gather up Phillips' notes and take them to study them. From them they learn that in his quest to cure cancer, Phillips may have accidentally created a new lifeform from the silicon atom. Thinking the doctors are at the castle, Constable Harris bikes up there looking for them to tell them about the discovery of a dead, boneless horse, only to wander into the laboratory's \\"test animals\\" room and be attacked and killed by an offscreen tentacled creature, the result of Dr Phillips's experiments. The creatures are eventually dubbed \\"silicates\\" by West and Stanley, and kill their victims by injecting a bone-dissolving enzyme into their bodies. The silicates are also incredibly difficult to kill, as Landers learns when he tries and fails to kill one at the castle with an axe when they first encounter them. After learning all they can from the late Dr Phillips's notes, West and Stanley recruit the islanders, led by \\"boss\\" Roger Campbell and store owner Peter Argyle, to attack the silicates with anything they've got. Bullets, petrol bombs, and dynamite all fail to even harm the silicates. But when one is found dead, apparently having ingested a rare isotope called Strontium-90 from Phillips' lab (via Phillips' accidentally irradiated Great Dane), West and Stanley realise they must find more of the isotope at the castle and figure out how to contaminate the remaining silicates with it before it is too late. They obtain enough isotope to contaminate a herd of cattle ‚Äì at the cost of Stanley's left hand, when he's grabbed by a silicate ‚Äì and the silicates feed on these and begin to die. The story ends with evacuation and medical teams inbound from the mainland, and West commenting on how fortunate they were that this outbreak was confined to an island. Had it happened on the mainland, he notes, they might never have stopped them in time. This sets up an epilogue and a visit to the satellite programme, in Japan, where the technicians are duplicating Phillips' work with the inevitable result. A technician walks down a corridor, hears a strange noise and investigates before screaming.

Oxendine (born April 30, 1962) is an American politician who served four terms as Insurance Commissioner of the U.S. state of Georgia. A member of the Republican party, he was first elected commissioner in 1994 and was reelected in 1998, 2002, and 2006. Prior to entering politics, Oxendine owned and operated a small business and was a lawyerhttp://www.gabar.org/directories/member_directory_search/member_detail/?id=NTU4MTU1 practicing in Gwinnett County, Georgia. Oxendine began his career working on several gubernatorial campaigns and was later appointed by Governor Joe Frank Harris to the State Personnel Board.  Early life  John Oxendine is one of two sons of Judge James W. Oxendine. His mother is Louise Oxendine. He has one brother, Tim from his father's first marriage. He has two sisters; Cindy Oxendine Sluder from his father's first marriage, and Shirley from his father's second marriage. John has no siblings from his father's third marriage. He grew up in Tucker, Georgia, where he was a Tucker Tiger and graduated from Tucker High School in 1980. Oxendine attributes his keen interest in politics to his father who was a former Senior Superior Court Judge in Gwinnett County (prior to his termination) since Oxendine was in school. He triple majored in Christianity, Greek, and political science at Mercer University, earning his Bachelor of Arts with honors in 1984. During college he worked at the Georgia State Capitol to pay for his tuition as a student assistant to Governor George Busbee. Oxendine attended Walter F. George School of Law at Mercer, where he continued being active in student organizations including the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, and graduated with his Juris Doctorate in 1987. Upon graduation from law school, Oxendine took over the family law practice, Oxendine and Associates, located in Gwinnett County, from his father. Oxendine and Associates concentrated in helping small businesses navigate the bureaucracy required when doing business with the federal government. Oxendine owned and ran this firm until he took the office of Insurance Commissioner in January 1995. Oxendine was called an \\"abomination\\" by a local judge who stated that \\"If I knew I could suspend you from practicing law in the state of Georgia for the rest of your life I would do so. You‚Äôre [an] abomination as far as I‚Äôm concerned.\\" Oxendine first married Lee, with whom he had one child, J.W.(23), a graduate of University of Georgia. Lee and Johnhttps://www.gwinnettcourts.com/casesearch/casedetail.aspx?M6VZWzlPug0adtTtwn1yKw divorced on Oct 26, 1995. Oxendine later married Ivy Adams, who had also been a student at Mercer in her younger years, and together they have one child Jake (5). Ivy Adams Oxendine has two children from her prior marriage. The family attends Mount Pisgah United Methodist Church, where he serves as an usher. He formerly resided in Peachtree Corners, and now resides in Duluth in Gwinnett County.  Political career  = Early years = Oxendine began his political life as a student assistant to Governor George Busbee. Oxendine later worked on the campaign staff of Joe Frank Harris, who was elected Governor and appointed Oxendine as chairman of the State Personnel Board. = Election as insurance commissioner = In the 1994 election, Oxendine opposed incumbent Democratic insurance commissioner Tim Ryles. After a long, grueling campaign, Oxendine won with 50.98% of the vote. = Potential U.S. Senate candidacies = When United States Senator Paul Coverdell died suddenly in 2000, Oxendine was inundated with calls to run for United States Senator, but decided against running. Republican leaders later settled on former U.S. Senator Mack Mattingly as their consensus Republican candidate; Mattingly was defeated by former Governor Zell Miller. In early 2003, Miller announced he would not seek reelection to the Senate, prompting Oxendine to again consider running for the seat. On January 8, 2003, Oxendine told the Atlanta Business Chronicle, \\"We've had countless people across the state asking us to run for the [U.S.] Senate, and I told people I was flattered by their faith in me and that I would consider it. I did consider it to the point of commissioning a poll and the results were every encouraging. It turned out I am one of the best-known and -liked politicians in the state.\\" However, when long time friend Congressman Johnny Isakson announced his candidacy a month later, Oxendine endorsed Isakson and restated his intention to serve out the remainder of his term as Insurance Commissioner. = 2006 campaign for lieutenant governor = In early 2004, Oxendine announced his intent to run for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia and formed an exploratory committee in 2005. He showed his fundraising prowess by raising approximately $500,000 for his campaign in just a couple months. In February 2005, after State Senator Casey Cagle and Christian political consultant Ralph Reed joined the race for Lieutenant Governor, Oxendine later announced that he would run for reelection as Insurance Commissioner. = 2006 reelection campaign = In the November election, Oxendine had his largest challenge since being sworn in, a Roy Barnes prot√©g√© and Democratic attorney Guy Drexinger. Oxendine defeated Drexinger by the largest margin in the cycle among those candidates with challengers, taking 65.6 percent of the vote to Drexinger's 34.4 percent. Oxendine carried 153 of Georgia's 159 counties. = As insurance commissioner = As insurance commissioner, John Oxendine brought reforms to the office, expanding the office hours and creating Georgia's first Telemedicine Program. Since becoming the first Republican to control a state agency, Oxendine has consistently run the department under budget, keeping the office open eleven hours a day (8:00 a.m. --7:00 pm), and returning money to the taxpayers every year he has been in office. Oxendine has brought the power of the private sector to bear in addressing Georgia's challenges. He created a public-private partnership to develop a comprehensive telemedicine program in the United States which expanded the availability of healthcare to every Georgia citizen without spending taxpayer dollars. For his work on behalf of Georgia consumers and health care providers, Oxendine was awarded the American Medical Association's highest honor, the only Insurance Commissioner to receive the David Award.http://www.ama- assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/37/CompleteListofRecipients.doc Mr. Oxendine said the state has a role in making sure auto insurance premiums do not get out of control. Subsequent to his leaving office Georgia experienced increased auto insurance rates, one year the largest increase in the United States. Oxendine has been criticized for using his emergency blue lights to bypass traffic congestion. He wrecked one agency car while using the emergency lights and siren to bypass traffic for what he claims was an emergency. Oxendine has since voluntarily given up the emergency lights, though only after being threatened that the privilege would be revoked involuntarily. = 2010 gubernatorial campaign = With Governor Sonny Perdue term-limited in 2010, Oxendine filed paperwork to run for the Republican nomination for governor.. Oxendine was criticized for threatening other state politicians to stay out of the race. After being seen as the front-runner in the Republican primary race for much of the campaign, Oxendine placed fourth in the July 20, 2010 primary.AJC: Handel, Deal survive first round in governor's race, head to GOP runoff = Campaign finance controversies = In May 2009, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Oxendine had received over $120,000,\\"Oxendine returns $120,000 in contributions\\". in campaign contributions from 10 different political action committees (PACs) in Alabama. The newspaper reported all ten PACs donated to Oxendine the maximum $12,000 contribution allowed by law; that the PACs all had similar addresses, and that the money originated from two insurance companies based in Georgia, while state law prohibits companies from giving money to the campaigns of elected officials who regulate them. Once the donations were brought to Oxendine's attention, he immediately returned the funds to their donors awaiting a legal opinion. Subsequently, ethics complaints were made regarding donations to Oxendine's campaigns to the Georgia Government Transparency & Campaign Finance Commission (formerly known as the State Ethics Commission). After Oxendine's lawyers argued they were beyond the statute of limitations, some ethics complaints were thrown out by the commission, but on August 21, 2019, the commission began the prosecution process for ethics violations by voting to move forward with a complaint regarding the $120,000 in PACs contributions and with a complaint that Oxendine illegally used remaining $237,000 in donations to Oxendine's failed 2010 gubernatorial race for personal expenses, including spending on a down payment for a house, an athletic club membership, child care expenses, and luxury car leases. Oxendine refuted the complaints as the result of the commission staff ignoring applicable law and fabricating slanderous statements contrary to the facts. = Gubernatorial campaign platform = ;Second Amendment Oxendine has publicly stated that he is \\"a proud Life Member of the National Rifle Association, the Georgia Sports Shooting Association, Gun Owners of America, and GeorgiaCarry.org\\". He says that he offers unapologetic, unqualified support of the Second Amendment. ;Abortion rights Oxendine is anti-abortion and opposes government funding of elective abortion. He supports parental consent laws for minors who seek an abortion and opposes late term abortions. He has stated that he hopes to put Planned Parenthood \\"out of business in Georgia\\" if elected governor. ;Health care reform Oxendine opposes a nationalized, government run health care system. He supports medical malpractice reforms as well as tax credits to increase access to insurance. He recently opposed the \\"high-risk\\" pool for those with pre-existing conditions in Georgia, leaving the duty of creating said pool up to the federal government, if it is created at all. ;Fair tax Oxendine has worked with fellow governors to encourage Congress to adopt The Fair Tax He has stated that \\"The Fair Tax is a cornerstone of my campaign; it is right for America and will help our children by once again making America the greatest manufacturing and economic capitol of the world.\\" ;Water Oxendine has indicated that he will support efforts to utilize new water reservoirs to ensure an adequate water supply for Georgia. ;Education Oxendine supports an education model which eliminates process micromanagement at the state level; maintaining local control but ensuring accountability. Oxendine supports an \\"equal access voucher system\\" that gives parents greater choice in their children's education. He supports efforts to expand charter schooling.

He was the sword-bearer of Theodoric the Great, who sent him to govern the Visigothic kingdom during the minority of Amalaric, the son of king Alaric II and Theodegotha, the daughter of king Theodoric. According to Procopius, during his governorship Theudis had married a Spanish woman who \\"belonged to the house of one of the wealthy inhabitants of that land, and not only possessed great wealth but also a great estate in Spain.\\" With this wealth he was able to muster a private army of two thousand men, effectively making him independent of Theodoric's authority. Theodoric did not take any action against Theudis. One reason was that doing so would give the Franks, who had killed the Visigothic king Alaric in the Battle of Vouill√©, an excuse to take to the field once again. Another was that Theudis was careful to obey the commands of his king, and never failed to send the annual tribute. Following the death of Amalaric, last of the Balti dynasty, Theudis was elected king. Renown historian Herwig Wolfram believes one factor that led to his selection was support of fellow Ostrogoths who had gone west with him. Whereas historian Peter Heather posits a second, noting that two of Theudis' Italian relatives‚ÄîIldibad and Totila‚Äîbecame kings of the Ostrogoths following the fall of the House of Theodoric in the Gothic Wars, adding that they likely represented \\"a particularly powerful non-royal clan.\\" In 541, Theudis had to confront the Franks under Chlothar I and Childebert I, who had penetrated as far as Zaragoza, which they besieged for forty-nine days, but according to Gregory of Tours the Franks lifted their siege when they learned the city was protected by the relics of Saint Vincent of Saragossa. The primary sources disagree over the outcome of this Frankish invasion; for instance, Isidore of Seville writes that the future king Theudigisel, who was then a general of Theudis, had killed all of the invaders except a group which had bribed him to allow them to escape; while Gregory of Tours posits that \\"they succeeded in conquering a large part of Spain and they returned to Gaul with immense booty.\\" Historian Roger Collins observes that this was the first Visigothic victory over their Frankish rivals‚Äîan achievement which undoubtedly added to Theudis' prestige. Early in his reign, Theudis (533) received a delegation from the Vandal king Gelimer seeking help against the impending Byzantine assault. Theudis received them cordially, throwing a banquet in their honor, at which he asked them how matters were at home. The envoys had traveled slowly to Hispania, and were out of contact with events in Carthage; meanwhile a merchant ship, which had left Carthage the same day it fell to the Byzantines, encountered favorable winds and reached Hispania first with the news, which Theudis had known when the Vandal envoys arrived. So when they proposed an alliance against the Byzantines, Theudis declined. Instead, he told them to go to the sea-coast, \\"For from there you will learn of the affairs at home with certainty.\\" Puzzled at this response, the envoys eventually followed his advice and returned to Carthage where they were taken prisoner by the victorious Byzantines. Roger Collins suggests that Theudis exploited the Vandals' defeat by occupying a portion of North Africa opposite Spain. This would explain why in 542 the Visigoths made an unsuccessful attempt to come to the defense of Ceuta, when the Byzantines besieged it from land and sea. According to Isidore of Seville, the invading army refused to fight on the Sabbath, and when the Byzantines learned of this attacked the Visigoths and left not one alive. Despite Theudis being an Arian Christian, Isidore of Seville praises him, for he not only tolerated the practices of the native Roman Catholic citizens, but permitted their bishops to meet at Toledo to arrange \\"those matters which were necessary for the teaching of the Church.\\" Collins notes that \\"of the few provincial councils that are known to have taken place in Spain before 589, nearly half were held during his (Theudis) reign: I Barcelonia in 540, Lerida in 546 and Valencia also in 546.\\" During his reign a further codification of Gothic law was effected and promulgated in November 546, which quoted numerous Roman authorities and was also intended to scale payments made to the iudices for rendering justice. In 548, he was assassinated in his palace by a man who had feigned madness in order to get close enough to strike the fatal blow. According to Isidore of Seville, as he bled out Theudis called out that no one kill his murderer, \\"saying that he had received a requital agreeing with his own deserts, because he himself too as a private citizen had killed his leader.\\" Motivation for this murder may very well have been a \\"blood feud\\" according to historian Herwig Wolfram, who notes that of some forty kings and anti-kings beginning with Alaric I, not even half of them died a natural death.

Conifer and her sister ships, commonly referred to as \\"one-eighties\\", served as the backbone of the Coast Guard's Aids to Navigation fleet for over 50 years before their replacement by the newer Juniper-class cutters. Background and ship development Conifers heritage can be traced back to the late 1930s, when the United States Lighthouse Service initiated a series of preliminary designs for a ship to replace their aging fleet of lighthouse tenders. The tenders were designed to provide logistics support (fuel, fresh water, and food) to manned off-shore lighthouses. They were also equipped to service the relatively few buoys in operation at that time. In 1940 the Lighthouse Service merged into the Coast Guard (The Coast Guard was formed in 1913 when the U.S. Revenue Service was combined with the U.S. Life Saving Service). The Coast Guard amended the tender designs to include Search and Rescue (SAR) features and an icebreaking capability, making them the first true \\"multi-mission\\" capable cutters. The SAR requirements provided finer design lines at the bow and stern, and a reduced beam to length ratio. A larger deckhouse was incorporated to increase the available interior space. Single screw propulsion, a cutaway forefoot under the bow, and rounded bilges facilitated ice-breaking. The hull displacement was . To reduce costs, on available off-the-shelf technology was utilized. The contract for the lead ship was awarded to Zenith Dredge Company of Duluth, Minnesota, in January 1941. The new class of Cutter was originally designated \\"WAGL\\" and was later changed to \\"WLB\\". The \\"W\\" is the navy's abbreviation or \\"Coast Guard\\", the \\"L\\" designates it as a lighthouse/buoy tender, and the \\"B\\" signifies it as a seagoing tender. The Coast Guard also operates three smaller classes of buoy tenders: WLM's (Coastal), WLI's (Inland), and WLR's (River). During the next 3 years the Coast Guard acquired a total of 39 WLB's: 17 built by Zenith, 21 were built by Marine Iron and Shipbuilding, also located in Duluth, and one was built at the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore, Maryland. Three different classes of WLB's were built: thirteen \\"A\\" (or Cactus) class, six \\"B\\" (or Mesquite) class, and twenty \\"C\\" (or Iris) class. Tenders are assigned botanical names, a tradition that stems back to 1867. Construction and specifications Conifer was the fifth \\"A\\" class WLB constructed. The procurement contract with Marine Iron and Shipbuilding was signed on 23 February 1942, for a cost of $854,003. The keel was laid on 6 July. Three months later, on 3 November, Conifer was launched at exactly 1200 hours. Conifers engineering plant consisted of two Cooper-Bessemer straight-8 cylinder, 4-cycle diesel engines. Because of their distinctive rumble, the Coopers were referred to as the \\"rock-crushers\\". Each diesel drove a Westinghouse DC generator. The DC electricity powered a single Westinghouse main-motor, which was coupled directly to the propeller shaft. The 5-bladed prop measured 8 ft 6 in (2.59 m) in diameter. The cargo boom and hoist winches were electric powered. The boat davits were hand-cranked, while the falls were fair-led to the aft towing capstan. Conifer was armed with a three-inch (76 mm) 50 caliber deck gun, four 20 millimeter 80 caliber anti-aircraft machine guns, and two racks of depth charges. Conifer was placed in Commission, Special Status, on 5 May 1943. Final outfitting and machinery tests were completed on 24 May. Conifer sailed across the Great Lakes and through the St. Lawrence Seaway en route to the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore, Maryland. The electronics package of HF radios, radar, and sonar was installed at the Yard. She sailed for shakedown training on 24 July 1943, with a full wartime complement of 6 officers and 74 crewmen. On 31 July Conifer arrived in Boston, her first homeport. Service history =1943‚Äì1945 (Wartime Service)= On 9 August 1943 Conifer was assigned to Commander, Task Force 24, Atlantic Fleet, U.S. Navy. On 13 August Conifer sailed on anti-submarine and weather station deployments in the North Atlantic. Conifer steamed as far south as Bermuda, east to the Azore Islands off Africa, and north into the icepacks of Greenland. On 8 August 1943, while underway in the North Atlantic Conifer observed a German U-boat diving. Using sonar she located a possible sub, and attacked with depth charges. The contact was later lost. On 28 September 1944 Conifer was underway at night off the coast of Greenland. When threatened with imminent attack from a Canadian B-24 bomber, Conifers gun crews were prepared to open fire when the aircraft finally responded to radio communications. On 30 September 1944 Conifer conducted a search with a B-17 and a B-24 for a damaged German submarine. The planes located an oil slick, and Conifer depth- charged the area. Additional oil appeared through the day, and the submarine was presumed sunk. On 24 January 1945, Conifer was assigned to Commander, Fifth Coast Guard District. On 2 February she was ordered to Chesapeake Bay to support convoy operations. On 1 May 1945, Conifer arrived in her new homeport, Portsmouth, Virginia. Her primary mission was to service aids to navigation along the southern Virginia and northern North Carolina coasts. =1952‚Äì1983= In August 1952 Conifers homeport was changed to Morehead City, North Carolina. In September 1960, Conifer moved back to Portsmouth, VA. On 11 June 1975, Conifer was once again assigned to Morehead City, NC. Conifers area of operation was modified to include the entire coast of North Carolina, and the re-supply of the Diamond Shoals and Frying Pan Shoals lightships. When required, Conifer broke ice in the Chesapeake Bay. =1983‚Äì1986 Overhaul= On 16 July 1983, Conifer arrived at the Coast Guard Yard. She was temporarily decommissioned, and commenced a $7.5 million overhaul under the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). Many noteworthy improvements were accomplished during the SLEP. The deckhouse was removed, and the hull was essentially gutted down to the keel. Conifer received new main engines and ship's service generators, a new electrical system, and a new interior climate control system. The interior spaces were reconfigured. The forward tanks were reduced in size, and the forward cargo hold was eliminated to make a space for additional berthing areas, a crew's lounge, and boatswain, electrical, damage control, and electronics shops. A bow thruster was installed. The electrical weight-handling gear was replaced with a hydraulic system. Hydraulic boat davits were installed, and the motor surf boat was replaced by a rigid hull inflatable (RHI). A new deckhouse was constructed with a larger pilothouse and a radio room. Six pieces of original equipment were re-installed: the anchor windlass; the mast; the ship's bell; the helm wheel; the main motor; and the steering gear. Conifer two new main engines were General Motors Electromotive Division V-8 two cycle diesel engines. They are the same engines employed in diesel freight trains. Each cylinder displaces 645 in3 (10.6 L). Each engine is conservatively rated at 1050 hp (783 kW), and produces an impressive of torque. The diesels rotate Westinghouse DC generators, which produce 275 volts 1650 amperes. A propulsion control computer regulates the ratio of volts to current delivered to the electric main propulsion motor. The main motor is rated at 1200 hp (890 kW). With the exception of minor preventive maintenance and scheduled cleanings, the main motor has worked continuously for 50 years. Conifer had other diesel engines: two turbo-charged Detroit Diesel/Johnson & Towers 6-71s powering the 200 kW ship's service generators; one Detroit turbo- charged 8V-71 powering four hydraulic pumps for the cargo boom; and a Detroit 6-71 powering the bow thruster. The Motor Cargo Boat was powered by a Detroit 3-53, and the rigid hull inflatable features a turbo-charged Volvo Penta engine and out drive. =1986‚Äì2000 (Final service with the Coast Guard)= On 11 August 1986, Conifer was re-commissioned as a United States Coast Guard cutter. On 4 October 1986, Conifer was assigned to Commander, Eleventh Coast Guard District, and arrived in San Pedro, California. Here she carried out her traditional duties until her decommissioning on 23 June 2000. =2000‚Äìpresent (F/V Hope)= Conifer is now the F/V Hope, part of the disaster relief fleet of Friend Ships.

Byzantine literature is the Greek literature of the Middle Ages, whether written in the territory of the Byzantine Empire or outside its borders.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica - \\"Greek literature: Byzantine literature\\" It forms the second period in the history of Greek literature after Ancient Greek literature. Although popular Byzantine literature and early Modern Greek literature both began in the 11th century, the two are indistinguishable.\\"The Modern Greek language in its relation to Ancient Greek\\", E. M. Geldart  Characteristics  Many of the classical Greek genres, such as drama and choral lyric poetry, had been obsolete by late antiquity, and all medieval literature in the Greek language was written in an archaizing style, which imitated the writers of ancient Greece. This practice was perpetuated by a long-established system of Greek education where rhetoric was a leading subject. A typical product of this Byzantine education was the Greek Church Fathers, who shared the literary values of their pagan contemporaries. Consequently, the vast Christian literature of the 3rd to 6th centuries established a synthesis of Hellenic and Christian thought. As a result, Byzantine literature was largely written in a style of Atticistic Greek, far removed from the popular Medieval Greek that was spoken by all classes of Byzantine society in their everyday lives. In addition, this literary style was also removed from the Koine Greek language of the New Testament, reaching back to Homer and the writers of ancient Athens. In this manner, the culture of the Byzantine Empire was marked for over 1000 years by a diglossy between two different forms of the same language, which were used for different purposes. However, the relations between the \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" forms of Greek changed over the centuries. The prestige of the Attic literature remained undiminished until the 7th century AD, but in the following two centuries when the existence of the Byzantine Empire was threatened, city life and education declined, and along with them the use of the classicizing language and style. The political recovery of the 9th century instigated a literary revival, in which a conscious attempt was made to recreate the Hellenic-Christian literary culture of late antiquity. Simple or popular Greek was avoided in literary use and many of the early saints' lives were rewritten in an archaizing style. By the 12th century the cultural confidence of the Byzantine Greeks led them to develop new literary genres, such as romantic fiction, in which adventure and love are the main elements. Satire made occasional use of elements from spoken Greek. The period from the Fourth Crusade to the Fall of Constantinople saw a vigorous revival of imitative classicizing literature, as the Greeks sought to assert their cultural superiority over the militarily more powerful West. At the same time there was the beginning of a flourishing literature in an approximation to the vernacular Modern Greek. However the vernacular literature was limited to poetic romances and popular devotional writing. All serious literature continued to make use of the archaizing language of learned Greek tradition. Byzantine literature has two sources: Classical Greek and Orthodox Christian tradition. Each of those sources provided a series of models and references for the Byzantine writer and his readers. In occasion, both sources were referred to side by side, for example when emperor Alexius Comnenus justified his actions of seizing church property to pay his soldiers by referring to the earlier examples of Pericles and the biblical king David. = Greek = The oldest of these three civilizations is the Greek, centered not in Athens but in Alexandria and Hellenistic civilization. Alexandria through this period is the center of both Atticizing scholarship and of Graeco-Judaic social life, looking towards Athens as well as towards Jerusalem. This intellectual dualism between the culture of scholars and that of the people permeates the Byzantine period. Even Hellenistic literature exhibits two distinct tendencies, one rationalistic and scholarly, the other romantic and popular: the former originated in the schools of the Alexandrian sophists and culminated in the rhetorical romance, the latter rooted in the idyllic tendency of Theocritus and culminated in the idyllic novel. Both tendencies persisted in Byzantium, but the first, as the one officially recognized, retained predominance and was not driven from the field until the fall of the empire. The reactionary linguistic movement known as Atticism supported and enforced this scholarly tendency. Atticism prevailed from the 2nd century BC onward, controlling all subsequent Greek culture, so that the living form of the Greek language was obscured and only occasionally found expression in private documents and popular literature. = Roman = Alexandria, the intellectual center, is balanced by Rome, the center of government. It is as a Roman Empire that the Byzantine state first entered history; its citizens were known as Romans (Rhomaioi), its capital, Constantinople, as New Rome. Its laws were Roman; so were its government, its army, and its official class, and at first also its language and its private and public life. The organization of the state was very similar to that of the Roman imperial period, including its hierarchy and bureaucratic elite. = Christian = It was in Alexandria that Graeco- Oriental Christianity had its birth. There the Septuagint translation had been made; there that that fusion of Greek philosophy and Jewish religion took place which culminated in Philo; there flourished the mystic speculative Neoplatonism associated with Plotinus and Porphyry. At Alexandria the great Greek ecclesiastical writers worked alongside pagan rhetoricians and philosophers; several were born here, e.g. Origen, Athanasius, and his opponent Arius, also Cyril and Synesius. On Egyptian soil monasticism began and thrived. After Alexandria, Antioch held great prestige, where a school of Christian commentators flourished under St. John Chrysostom and where later arose the Christian universal chronicles. In surrounding Syria, we find the germs of Greek ecclesiastical poetry, while from neighboring Palestine came St. John of Damascus, one of the Greek Fathers. = Oriental = Greek Christianity had of necessity a pronounced Oriental character; Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Syria are the real birthplaces of the Graeco-Oriental church and Byzantine civilization in general. Egypt and Syria, with Asia Minor, became for the autochthonous Greek civilization a place where hundreds of flourishing cities sprang into existence, where energies confined or crippled in the impoverished homeland found release; not only did these cities surpass in material wealth the mother country, but soon also cultivated the highest goods of the intellect (Krumbacher). Under such circumstances it is not strange that about nine-tenths of all the Byzantine authors of the first eight centuries were natives of Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and Asia Minor.  Genres  The following account classifies Byzantine literature into five groups. The first three include representatives of those kinds of literature which continued the ancient traditions: historians and chroniclers, encyclopedists and essayists, and writers of secular poetry. The other two include new literary genres, ecclesiastical and theological literature, and popular poetry. = Historians and annalists = The two groups of secular prose literature show clearly the dual character of Byzantine intellectual life in its social, religious, and linguistic aspects. From this point of view historical and annalistic literature supplement each other; the former is aristocratic and secular, the latter ecclesiastical and monastic; the former is classical, the latter popular. The works of the historians belong to scholarly literature, those of the annalists (or chroniclers) to the literature of the people. The former are carefully elaborated, the latter give only raw material, the former confine themselves to the description of the present and the most recent past, and thus have rather the character of contemporary records; the latter cover the whole history of the world as known to the Middle Ages. The former are therefore the more valuable for political history; the latter for the history of civilization.  Historians  An illumination of a scene from the Skylitzes Chronicle, depicting a Thracesian woman killing a Varangian who tried to rape her, whereupon his comrades praised her and gave her his possessions. Classical literary tradition set the standard for Byzantine historians in their grasp of the aims of history, the manner of handling their subjects, and in style of composition. Their works are thoroughly concrete and objective in character, without passion, and even without enthusiasm. Ardent patriotism and personal convictions are rarely evident. They are diplomatic historians, expert in the use of historical sources and in the polished tact called for by their social position; they are not cIoset-scholars, ignorant of the world, but men who stood out in public life: jurists like Procopius, Agathias, Evagrius, Michael Attaliates, statesmen like Joannes Cinnamus, Nicetas Acominatus, Georgius Pachymeres, Laonicus Chalcondyles; generals and diplomats like Nicephorus Bryennius the Younger, George Acropolites, Georgius Phrantzes; and even crowned heads, like Constantine Porphyrogenitus, Anna Comnena, John VI Cantacuzene, and others. The Byzantine historians thus represent not only the social but also the intellectual flower of their time, resembling in this their Greek predecessors, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, and Polybius, who became their guides and models. Sometimes a Byzantine chooses a classic writer to imitate in method and style. The majority, however, took as models several authors, a custom which gave rise to a peculiar mosaic style, quite characteristic of the Byzantines. While often the result of a real community of feeling, it effectively prevented development of an individual style. Had such a pre√´minent historian as Procopius modeled his work after Polybius rather than Thucydides, Byzantine histories may have followed a natural continuity in style and method with the Hellenic era. The Hellenistic \\"Atticists\\" however had impressed their tastes thoroughly on later centuries, celebrating the style of the Athenian golden age. It is no accident that military characters like Nicephorus Bryennius (11th and 12th centuries) and Joannes Cinnamus (12th century) emulated Xenophon in the precision of their diction, or that a philosopher like Nicephorus Gregoras (13th century) took Plato as his model. On the other hand, it is doubtless due to chance that writers trained in theology like Leo Diaconus and Georgius Pachymeres chose to emulate Homeric turns. On the whole it is in the later historians that the dualism of Byzantine civilization‚Äîecclesiastico-political matter in classical form‚Äîbecomes most apparent. While Byzantine historians were mostly dependent on foreign models, and seem to form a continuous series in which each succeeds the last, they do not blend into a uniform whole. Most of the historians come in either the period embracing the 6th and 7th centuries during the reigns of the East-Roman emperors, or that extending from the 11th to the 15th century under the Comneni and the Palaeologi. At its zenith under the Macedonian dynasty (the 9th and 10th centuries) the Byzantine world produced great heroes, but no great historians, excepting the solitary figure of the Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus. The first period is dominated by Procopius because of his subject matter and his literary importance. Typically Byzantine, his Anekdota depreciates Emperor Justinian I as emphatically as his Peri Ktismaton apotheosizes him. In literature and history though, he follows classical models, as is evident in the precision and lucidity of his narrative acquired from Thucydides, and in the reliability of his information, qualities of special merit in the historian. Procopius and to a great degree his successor Agathias remain the models of descriptive style as late as the 11th century. Procopius is the first representative of the ornate Byzantine style in literature and in this is surpassed only by Theophylaktos Simokattes in the 7th century. Despite their unclassical form, however, they approach the ancients in their freedom from ecclesiastical and dogmatic tendencies. Between the historical writings of the first period and those of the second, there is an isolated series of works which in matter and form offer a strong contrast to both the aforesaid groups. These are the works under the name of the Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (10th century), dealing respectively with the administration of the empire, its political division, and the ceremonies of the Byzantine Court. They treat of the internal conditions of the empire, and the first and third are distinguished by their use of a popular tongue. The first is an important source of ethnological information, while the last is an interesting contribution to the history of civilization. The second group of historians present a classical eclecticism veiling an unclassical partisanship and theological fanaticism. Revelling in classical forms, the historians of the period of the Comneni and Palaeologi were devoid of the classical spirit. While many had stronger, more sympathetic personalities than the school of Procopius, the very vigor of these individuals and their close ties to the imperial government served to hamper their objectivity, producing subjective, partisan works. Thus the \\"Alexiad\\", the pedantic work of Princess Anna Comnena, glorifies her father Alexius and the imperial reorganization he began; the historical work of her husband, Nicephorus Bryennius, describes the internal conflicts that accompanied the rise of the Comneni in the form of a family chronicle (late 11th century); John VI Cantacuzene self-complacently narrates his own achievements (14th century). This group exhibits striking antitheses both personal and objective. Beside Cinnamus, who honestly hated everything Western, stand the broad-minded Nicetas Acominatus (12th century) and the conciliatory but dignified Georgius Acropolites (13th century); beside the theological polemicist Pachymeres (13th century), stands the man of the world, Nicephorus Gregoras (14th century), well versed in philosophy and the classics. Though subjective in matters of internal Byzantine history, these and others of this period are trustworthy in their accounts of external events, and especially valuable as sources for the first appearance of the Slavs and Turks.  Chroniclers  A Byzantine Gospel of the 13th century, it shows the increasing trend towards the use of Ivory as an artistic tool. Unlike the historical works, Byzantine chronicles were intended for the general public; hence the difference in their origin, development, and diffusion, as well as in their character, method, and style. While the roots of the chronicle have not yet been satisfactorily traced, their comparatively late appearance (6th century) and total remove from Hellenistic tradition places their origins as fairly recent. The chronicle literature is originally foreign to Greek civilization, the first of which was composed by uneducated Syrians. Its presumable prototype, the \\"Chronography\\" of Sextus Julius Africanus, points to an Oriental Christian source. Unconnected with persons of distinction and out of touch with the great world, it follows models bound within its own narrow sphere. The 9th century saw the zenith of the Byzantine chronicle, during the nadir of historical literature. Afterwards it declines abruptly; the lesser chroniclers, seen as late as the 12th century, draw partly from contemporary and partly, though rarely, from earlier historians. In the Palaeologi period no chroniclers of note appear. Not only important sources for the history of Byzantine civilization, the chronicles themselves contributed to the spread of civilization, passing Byzantine culture to the arriving Slavic, Magyar, and Turkic peoples. Depicting as they did what lay within the popular consciousness‚Äîevents wonderful and dreadful painted in glaring colours and interpreted in a Christian sense‚Äîtheir influence was considerable. The method of handling materials is primitive‚Äîbeneath each section lies some older source only slightly modified, so that the whole resembles a patchwork of materials rather than the ingenious mosaic of the historians. They are a rich store for comparative linguistics, as their diction is purely the popular tongue, bespeaking the poor education of author and audience. Representative Byzantine chronicles are the three of Joannes Malalas, Theophanes Confessor, and Joannes Zonaras, respectively. The first is the earliest Christian Byzantine monastic chronicle, composed in the Antioch in the 6th century by a hellenized Syrian and Monophysite theologian. Originally a city chronicle, it was expanded into a world-chronicle. It is a popular historical work, full of historical and chronological errors, and the first monument of a purely popular Hellenistic civilization. The chief source for most of the later chroniclers as well as for a few church historians, it is also the earliest popular history translated into Old Church Slavonic (c. early 10th century). Superior in substance and form, and more properly historical, is the Chronicle of Theophanes, a 9th-century monk of Asia Minor, and in its turn a model for later chronicles. It contains much valuable information from lost sources, and its importance for the Western world is due to the fact that by the end of the 9th century it had to be translated into Latin. A third guide-post in the history of Byzantine chronicles is the 12th-century Universal Chronicle of Zonaras. It reflects somewhat the atmosphere of the Comneni renaissance; not only is the narrative better than that of Theophanes, but many passages from ancient writers are worked into the text. It was translated not only into Slavic and Latin, but into Italian and French as well (16th century). = Encyclopedists and essayists = A page from a 16th-century edition of the vast Byzantine encyclopaedia, the Suda. The spirit of antiquarian scholarship awoke in Byzantium earlier than in the West, but begun by lay theologians, not laymen. For this reason it always had a scholastic flavor; the Byzantine humanistic spirit savored of antiquity and the Middle Ages in equal proportion. Primarily directed to the systematic collection and sifting of manuscripts, a pronounced interest in the literature of Greek antiquity first manifested at Constantinople in the late 9th century. With the 12th century begins the period of original works imitating antique models, a revival of the Alexandrian essay and rhetorical literature, a number of writers showing vigorous originality. Quite isolated between the two periods stands Michael Psellus (11th century), a universal genius who bridges the periods. While the humanism of the 9th and 10th centuries retained a theological coloring and a hostile attitude towards the West, the 12th to the 14th century saw several writers seeking to break away from orthodox classicism to attain a true humanism, becoming the forerunners of the Italian Renaissance. The new spirit first found expression in an academy founded for classical studies at Constantinople in 863. About the same time the broadly trained and energetic Photius, patriarch of the city and the greatest statesman of the Greek Church (820-897), enthusiastically collected forgotten manuscripts, revived forgotten works of antiquity, and re-discovered lost works; his attention was chiefly directed to prose works, indicative of his pragmatism. Photius made selections or excerpts from all the works he discovered, forming the beginning of his celebrated Bibliotheca (\\"Library\\"), which while dry and schematic remains the most valuable literary compendium of the Middle Ages, containing trustworthy summaries of many ancient works now lost, together with good characterizations and analyses such as those of Lucian and Heliodorus. This encyclopedic activity was more assiduously pursued in the 10th century, particularly in the systematic collecting of materials associated with Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus. Scholars also formed great compilations, arranged by subject, on the basis of older sources. Among these was a now-fragmentary encyclopedia of political science containing extracts from the classical, Alexandrian, and Roman Byzantine periods. These, with the collection of ancient epigrams known as the Anthologia Palatina and the scientific dictionary known as the Suda, make the 10th century that of the encyclopedias. A typical representative of the period appears in the following century in the person of the greatest encyclopedist of Byzantine literature, Michael Psellus. Standing between the Middle Ages and modern times, he is a jurist and a man of the world with a mind both receptive and productive. Unlike Photius, who was more concerned with individual philosophic arguments, Psellus does not undervalue the old philosophers, and is himself of a philosophic temperament. He was the first of his intellectual circle to raise the philosophy of Plato above that of Aristotle and to teach philosophy as a professor. Surpassing Photius in intellect and wit, he lacks that scholar's dignity and solidity of character. A restless brilliance characterized his life and literary activity. At first a lawyer, then a professor; now a monk, now a court official; he ended his career the prime minister. He was equally adroit and many-sided in his literary work; in harmony with the polished, pliant nature of the courtier is his elegant Platonic style of his letters and speeches. His extensive correspondence furnishes endless material illustrating his personal and literary character. The ennobling influence of his Attic models mark his speeches and especially his funerary orations; that delivered on the death of his mother shows deep sensibility. Psellus had more of a poetic temperament than Photius, as several of his poems show, though they owe more to satirical fancy and occasion than to deep poetic feeling. Though Psellus exhibits more formal skill than creativity, his endowments shone forth in a time particularly backward in aesthetic culture. The intellectual freedom of the great scholars (polyhistores), both ecclesiastical and secular, of the following centuries would be inconceivable without the triumph of Psellus over Byzantine scholasticism. A Modern copy of a Byzantine Horologion, showing the daily cycle of the Eastern Orthodox Church. While among his successors‚Äîsuch as Nicephorus Blemmydes and Hyrtakenos‚Äîare natures as corrupt as Psellus' own, the majority are marked by their rectitude of intention, sincerity of feeling, and their beneficently broad culture. Among these great intellects and strong characters of the 12th century several theologians are especially conspicuous, for example Eustathius of Thessalonica, Michael Italicus, and Michael Acominatus; in the 13th and 14th centuries several secular scholars, like Maximus Planudes, Theodorus Metochites, and above all, Nicephorus Gregoras. The three theologians may best be judged by their letters and minor occasional writings. Eustathius seems to be the most important, writing learned commentary on Homer and Pindar alongside original works that are candid, courageous, and controversial, intent upon the correction of every evil. In one of his works he attacks the corruption and intellectual stagnation of the monastic life of that day; in another polemic, he assails the hypocrisy and sham holiness of his time; in a third he denounces the conceit and arrogance of the Byzantine priests. The rhetorician Michael Italicus, later a bishop, attacks the chief weakness of Byzantine literature, external imitation; this he did on receiving a work by a patriarch, which was simply a disorderly collection of fragments from other writers, so poorly put together that the sources were immediately recognizable. The pupil and friend of Eustathius, Michael Acominatus (12th and 13th centuries) Archbishop of Athens and brother of the historian Nicetas Acominatus. His inaugural address, delivered on the Acropolis, exhibits both profound classical scholarship and high enthusiasm despite the material and spiritual decay of his times. These pitiful conditions moved him to compose an elegy, famous because unique, on the decay of Athens, a sort of poetical and antiquarian apostrophe to fallen greatness. Gregorovius compared the inaugural address with Gregory the Great's to the Romans, and this with the lament of Bishop Hildebert of Tours on the demolition of Rome by the Normans (1106). His funeral orations over Eustathius (1195) and his brother Nicetas, though wordier and rhetorical, still evinced a noble disposition and deep feeling. Michael, like his brother, remained a fanatical opponent of the Latins. They had driven him into exile at Ceos, whence he addressed many letters to his friends illustrating his character. Stylistically influenced by Eustathius, his otherwise classical diction sounded an ecclesiastical note. With Theodore Metochites and Maximos Planoudes we come to the universal scholars (polyhistores) of the time of the Palaeologi. The former displays his humanism in his use of hexameter, the latter in his knowledge of the Latin; both of which are otherwise unknown in Byzantium, and foreboding a broader grasp of antiquity. Both men show a fine sense of poetry, especially of nature poetry. Metochites composed meditations on the beauty of the sea; Planudes was the author of a long poetic idyll, a genre uncultivated by Byzantine scholars. While Metochites was a thinker and poet, Planudes was chiefly an imitator and compiler. Metochites was more speculative, as his collection of philosophical and historical miscellanies show; Planudes was more precise, as his preference for mathematics proves. Contemporary progress in philosophy was at a point where Metochites could openly attack Aristotle. He deals more frankly with political questions, such as his comparison of democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy. While his breadth of interest was large, Metochites's culture rests wholly on a Greek basis, though Planudes, by his translations from the Latin (Cato, Ovid, Cicero, Caesar, and Boethius), vastly enlarged the Eastern intellectual horizon. This inclination toward the West is most noticeable in Nicephorus Gregoras, the great pupil of Metochites. His project for a reform of the calendar ranks him among the modern intellects of his time, as will be proven if ever his numerous works in every domain of intellectual activity are brought to light. His letters, especially, promise a rich harvest. His method of exposition is based on that of Plato, whom he also imitated in his ecclesiastico-political discussions, e.g. in his dialogue \\"Florentius, or Concerning Wisdom.\\" These disputations with Barlaam dealt with the question of church union, in which Gregoras took the Unionist part. This brought him bitter hostility and the loss of his teaching living; he had been occupied chiefly with the exact sciences, whereby he had already earned the hatred of orthodox Byzantines. While the Byzantine essayists and encyclopedists stood wholly under the influence of ancient rhetoric, still they embodied in the traditional forms their own characteristic knowledge, and thereby lent it a new charm. = Secular poetry = Poetry likewise had its prototypes, each genre tracing its origins to an ancient progenitor. Unlike the prose, these new genres do not follow from the classical Attic period, for the Byzantines wrote neither Iyrics nor dramas, imitating neither Pindar nor Sophocles. Imitating the literature of the Alexandrian period, they wrote romances, panegyrics, epigrams, satires, and didactic and hortatory poetry, following the models of Heliodorus and Achilles Tatius, Asclepiades and Posidippus, Lucian and Longus. Didactic poetry looks to an earlier prototype by Isocrates' Ad Demonicum. The poetic temperament of the Byzantines is thus akin to that of the Alexandrian writers. Only one new type evolved independently by the Byzantines‚Äîthe begging-poem. The six genres are not contemporaneous: the epigram and the panegyric developed first (6th and 7th centuries), then, at long intervals, satire, next didactic and begging poetry, finally the romance. Only after the 12th century, the period of decay, do they appear side by side. The epigram was the only form of secular poetry that had an independent revival in Byzantine literature, and this at the very time when ecclesiastical poetry also reached its highest perfection, in the 6th and 7th centuries. This age is therefore the most flourishing period of Byzantine scholarly poetry; its decline in the 12th century is contemporary with the rise of popular poetry. The chief kinds of poetry during the period of the decline (11th to 13th century) were satire and parody, didactic and hortatory poetry, the begging- poem, and the erotic romance. In form this literature is characterized by its extensive use of the popular forms of speech and verse, the latter being the \\"political\\" verse (Greek ·º°ŒºŒ±ŒæŒµœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøŒπ œÉœÑŒØœáŒøŒπ, called \\"that abominable make- believe of a metre\\" by Charles Peter Mason in William Smith's Dictionary), an iambic verse of fifteen syllables, still the standard verse of modern Greek popular poetry . In content, however, all this literature continues to bear the imprint of Byzantine erudition.  Epigram  The epigram suited the Byzantine taste for the ornamental and for intellectual ingenuity. It corresponded exactly to the concept of the minor arts that attained high development in the Byzantine period. Making no lofty demands on the imagination of the author, its chief difficulty lay rather in technique and the attainment of the utmost possible pregnancy of phrase. Two groups may be distinguished among the Byzantine epigrammatists: one pagan and humanistic, the other Christian. The former is represented chiefly by Agathias (6th century) and Christophorus of Mitylene (11th century), the latter by the ecclesiastics Georgius Pisides (7th century) and Theodorus Studites (9th century). Between the two groups, in point of time as well as in character, stands Joannes Geometres (10th century). The chief phases in the development of the Byzantine epigram are most evident in the works of these three. Agathias, who has already been mentioned among the historians, as an epigrammatist, has the peculiarities of the school of the semi-Byzantine Egyptian Nonnus (about AD 400). He wrote in an affected and turgid style, in the classical form of the hexameter; he abounds, however, in brilliant ideas, and in his skillful imitation of the ancients, particularly in his erotic pieces, he surpasses most of the epigrammatists of the imperial period. Agathias also prepared a collection of epigrams, partly his own and partly by other writers, some of which afterwards passed into the Anthologia Palatina and have thus been preserved. The abbot Theodorus Studites is in every respect the opposite of Agathias, a pious man of deep earnestness, with a fine power of observation in nature and life, full of sentiment, warmth, and simplicity of expression, free from servile imitation of the ancients, though influenced by Nonnus. While touching on the most varied things and situations, his epigrams on the life and personnel of his monastery offer special interest for the history of civilization. Joannes Geometres combines aspects of the previous two. During the course of his life he filled both secular and ecclesiastical offices and his poetry had a universal character; of a deeply religious temper, still he appreciated the greatness of the ancient Greeks. Alongside epigrams on ancient poets, philosophers, rhetoricians, and historians stand others on famous Church Fathers, poets, and saints. Poetically, the epigrams on contemporary and secular topics are superior to those on religious and classic subjects. His best works depict historical events and situations he himself experienced, and reflect his own spiritual moods (Krumbacher). The Scholar Emperor Constantine VII, being crowned by Christ.  Panegyrics  Even the best writers often could not escape composing the official panegyrics on emperors and their achievements. Typical of this kind of literature are the commemorative poem of Paulus Silentiarius on the dedication of the church of St. Sophia, and that of Georgius Pisides on the glory of the prince. Unfavorable conclusions must not be drawn as to the character of these poets, for such eulogies were composed by not only courtiers like Psellus and Manuel Holobolos (13th century), but also by independent characters like Eustathius and Michael Acominatus. It had become traditional, and so handed down from imperial Rome to Byzantium as a part of ancient rhetoric with all the extravagance of a thoroughly decadent literature (F. Gregorovius). It was a sort of necessary concession to despotism; popular taste was not in general offended by it.  Satires  The father of Byzantine satire is Lucian. His celebrated \\"Dialogues of the Dead\\" furnished the model for two works, one of which, the \\"Timarion\\" (12th century) is marked by more rude humour, the other, \\"Mazaris\\" (15th century), by keen satire. Each describes a journey to the underworld and conversations with dead contemporaries; in the former their defects are lashed with good-natured raillery; in the latter, under the masks of dead men, living persons and contemporary conditions, especially at the Byzantine Court, are sharply stigmatized. The former is more a literary satire, the latter a political pamphlet, with keen personal thrusts and without literary value, but with all the greater interest for the history of civilization; the former is in a genuinely popular tone, the latter in vulgar and crude [Cf. Tozer in The Journal of Hellenic Studies (1881), II.233-270; Krumbacher, op. cit., 198-211.] Two popular offshoots of the \\"Timarion\\", the \\"Apokopos\\" and the \\"Piccatoros\\" are discussed below. Another group of satires takes the form of dialogues between animals, manifestly a development from the Christian popular book known as the Physiologus. Such satires describe assemblages of quadrupeds, birds, and fishes, and recite their lampooning remarks upon the clergy, the bureaucracy, the foreign nations in the Byzantine Empire, etc. See also An Entertaining Tale of Quadrupeds Here belong also the parodies in the form of church poems, and in which the clergy themselves took part, e.g. Bishop Nicetas of Serr√¶ (11th century). One example of this sacrilegious literature, though not fully understood, is the \\"Mockery of a Beardless Man,\\" in the form of an obscene liturgy (14th century).  Didactic  Didactic poetry found its model in the \\"To Demonikos\\" ascribed to Isocrates. The greatest example of this type of literature in Byzantium is the \\"Spaneas\\" (12th century), a hortatory poem addressed by an emperor to his nephew, a sort of \\"Mirror for Princes\\". Some few offshoots from this are found in the popular literature of Crete in the 15th and 16th centuries, handed down under the names of Sahlikis and Depharanus. Here also belong the ranting theological exhortations resembling those of the Capuchin in Schiller's \\"Wallenstein\\". Such, for instance, are that of Geogillas after the great plague of Rhodes (1498) and the oracular prophecies on the end of the Byzantine empire current under the name of Emperor Leo (886-911). (Krumbacher, 332, 336, 343, 352, 366.)  Begging-poem  A late Byzantine variety of the laudatory poem is the begging-poem, the poetical lament of hungry authors and the parasites of the court. Its chief representatives are Theodorus Prodromus and the grossly flattering Manuel Philes, the former of whom lived under the Comneni (12th century), the latter under the Palaeologi (13th century). For historians such poetical wails of distress as Prodromus addressed to the emperor are of value because they give interesting pictures of street and business life in the capital. (Cf. Krumbacher, 324, 333.) Romance novel The ancient Greek novel was imitated by four writers of the 12th century: Eustathios Makrembolites, Theodore Prodromos, Niketas Eugenianos, and Constantine Manasses. = Ecclesiastical and theological literature = The first flowering of ecclesiastical literature of Byzantium is Hellenistic in form and Oriental in spirit. This period falls in the 4th century and is closely associated with the names of the Greek Fathers of Alexandria, Palestine, Jerusalem, Cyrene, and Cappadocia. Their works, which cover the whole field of ecclesiastical prose literature‚Äîdogma, exegesis, and homiletics‚Äîbecame canonical for the whole Byzantine period; the last important work is the ecclesiastical history of Evagrius. Beyond controversial writings against sectarians and the Iconoclasts, later works consist merely of compilations and commentaries, in the form of the so-called Catenae; even the Fountain of Knowledge of John of Damascus (8th century), the fundamental manual of Greek theology, though systematically worked out by a learned and keen intellect, is merely a gigantic collection of materials. Even the homily clings to a pseudo- classical, rhetorical foundation, and tends more to external breadth, not to inwardness and depth. Only three kinds of ecclesiastical literature, which were as yet undeveloped in the 4th century, exhibit later an independent growth. These were the ecclesiastical poetry of the 6th century, popular lives of the saints of the 7th, and the mystic writings of the 11th and 12th centuries. The Catholic Encyclopedia suggests that classical forms were insufficient to express Christian thought to best effect: in several collections of early Christian correspondence it is not the rhythmic laws of Greek rhetorical style which govern the composition, but those of Semitic and Syriac prose. Cardinal Pitra hypothesizes that the rhythmic poetry of the Byzantines originates in the Jewish Psalms of the Septuagint. This rhythmic principle accords with the linguistic character of the later Greek, which used a stress accent as it had already been developed in Syriac poetry rather than the classical tonal accent. Romanos the Melodist was the first great ecclesiastical poet of the Greeks to fully embrace the stress accent as a rhythmic principle. A contemporary and countryman of the chronicler Malalas, also a reformer of the Greek literary language, Romanos was a Syrian of Jewish descent, Christianized at an early age. What Malalas is to prose, Romanos is to the Christian poetry of the Greek Middle Ages. Though he did not go so far as Malalas, he released poetry from meters based on quantitative and tonal scansion; he brought it into harmony with the latest poetics prevailing in Syria as well as with the evolving character of the Greek language. Romanos soon went to Constantinople, where he became a deacon of the Hagia Sophia, and where he is said to have first developed his gift for hymn-writing. An illustration of the Parable of the Good Samaritan from the Rossano Gospels, believed to be the oldest surviving illustrated New Testament. Romanos borrowed the form of his poems, the material, and many of their themes partly from the Bible and partly from the (metrical) homilies of the Syrian Father Ephrem (4th century). He wrote hymns on the Passion of the Lord, on the betrayal by Judas, Peter's denial, Mary before the Cross, the Ascension, the Ten Virgins, and the Last Judgment, while his Old Testament themes mention the history of Joseph and the three young men in the fiery furnace. He is said to have composed about a thousand hymns, of which only eighty have survived, evidently because in the 9th century the so-called canones, linguistically and metrically more artistic in form, replaced much of his work in the Greek Liturgy. Thenceforth his hymns held their own in only a few of the remoter monasteries. Characteristic of his technique is the great length of his hymns, which are regularly composed of from twenty to thirty stanzas (œÑœÅŒøœÄŒ±œÅŒπŒ±) of from twelve to twenty-one verses each, very finely wrought and varied in metrical structure, and in construction transparent and diverse. They do not resemble contemporary Latin hymns so much as the oratorios of the early 20th century, also using antiphonal rendering by alternative choirs. This also explains the dramatic character of many hymns, with their inserted dialogues and choric songs, as in \\"Peter's Denial\\", a little drama of human boastfulness and weakness, and the last part of the \\"History of Joseph\\", the \\"Psalm of the Apostles\\", and the \\"Birth of Jesus\\". Other pieces, like the hymn on the Last Judgment, are purely descriptive in character, though even in them the rhetorical and dogmatic elements seriously impair the artistic effect. Some, like Bouvy and Krumbacher, place him among the greatest hymn-writers of all times; others, like Cardinal Pitra, are more conservative. For a final judgment a complete edition of the hymns is needed. Compared to Latin church poets such as Ambrose and Prudentius, his surviving works tend towards a more rhetorically flowery, digressive, and dogmatic verse. He is fond of symbolic pictures and figures of speech, antitheses, assonances, especially witty jeux d'esprit, which contrast with his characteristic simplicity of diction and construction. These embellishments interrupt the smooth flow of his lines, and often the sequence of thought in his hymns is clouded by the dragging in of dogmatic questions‚Äîin the celebrated Christmas hymn the question of the miraculous birth of Jesus is discussed four times, with a comfortable amplitude that betrays the theologian thrusting the poet aside. The theologian is also too evident in his allusions to the Old Testament when dealing with New Testament incidents; Mary at the birth of Jesus compares her destiny to that of Sarah, the Magi liken the star that went before the Israelites in the wilderness, and so on. The frequent citation of passages from the prophets seem more like unimpassioned paraphrases than like inspired poetry. In fact Romanos does not possess the abundant and highly coloured imagery of the earliest Greek church poets, nor their fine grasp of nature. The reader also gathers the impression that the height of the poet's imagination is not in proportion with the depth of his piety‚Äîthere often appears in him something naive, almost homely, as when Mary expresses her pleasure in the Magi and calls attention to their utility for the impending Flight into Egypt. There are passages, however, in which devout fervor carries the imagination along with it and elevates the poetic tone, as in the jubilant invitation to the dance (in the Easter-song), in which thoughts of spring and of the Resurrection are harmoniously blended: :Why thus faint-hearted? :Why veil ye your faces? :Lift up your hearts! :Christ is arisen! :Join in the dances, :And with us proclaim it: :The Lord is ascended, :Gleaming and gloried, :He who was born :Of the giver of light. :Cease then your mourning, :Rejoice in blessedness: :Springtime has come. :So bloom now, ye lilies, :Bloom and be fruitful! :Naught bringeth destruction. :Clap we our hands :And shout: Risen is He :Who helpeth the fallen ones :To rise again. Ecclesiastical poetry did not long remain on the high level to which Romanos had raised it. The \\"Hymnus Acathistus\\" (of unknown authorship) of the 7th century, a sort of Te Deum in praise of the Mother of God, is the last great monument of Greek church poetry, comparable to the hymns of Romanos, which it has even outlived in fame. It has had numerous imitators and as late as the 17th century was translated into Latin. The rapid decline of Greek hymnology begins as early as the 7th century, the period of Andrew of Crete. Religious sentiments in hymns were choked by a classical formalism which stifled all vitality. The overvaluation of technique in details destroyed the sense of proportion in the whole. This seems to be the only explanation for the so-called canones first found in the collection of Andrew of Crete. While a canon is a combination of a number of hymns or chants (generally nine) of three or four strophes each, the \\"Great Canon\\" of Andrew actually numbers 250 strophes, a \\"single idea is spun out into serpentine arabesques\\". Pseudo-classical artificiality found an even more advanced representative in John of Damascus, in the opinion of the Byzantines the foremost writer of canones, who took as a model Gregory of Nazianzus, even reintroducing the principle of quantity into ecclesiastical poetry. Religious poetry was in this way reduced to mere trifling, for in the 11th century, which witnessed the decline of Greek hymnology and the revival of pagan humanism, Michael Psellus began parodying church hymns, a practice that took root in popular culture. Didactic poems took this form without being regarded as blasphemous. Religious drama did not thrive in the Byzantine era. The only example is the Suffering of Christ (Christus Patiens, ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑ·Ω∏œÇ –øŒ¨œÉœáœâŒΩ ), written in the 11th or 12th century; of its 2,640 verses, about one-third are borrowed from ancient dramas, chiefly from those of Euripides, and Mary, the chief character, sometimes recites verses from the \\"Medea\\" of Euripides, again from the \\"Electra\\" of Sophocles, or the \\"Prometheus\\" of Aeschylus. The composition is evidently the production of a theologian trained in the classics, but without the slightest idea of dramatic art. It is made up chiefly of lamentations and reports of messengers. Even the most effective scenes, those which precede the Crucifixion, are described by messengers; almost two-thirds of the text are given to the descent from the Cross, the lament of Mary, and the apparition of Christ. (Cf. Van Cleef, \\"The Pseudo- Gregorian Drama Christos paschon in its relation to the text of Euripides\\" in Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, VIII, 363-378; Krumbacher, 312.) Between ecclesiastical poetry and ecclesiastical prose stands the theologico-didactic poem, a favorite species of ancient Christian literature. One of its best examples is the \\"Hexaemeron\\" of Georgius Pisides, a spirited hymn on the universe and its marvels, i.e. all living creatures. Taken as a whole, it is somewhat conventional; only the description of the minor forms of life, especially of the animals, reveals the skill of the epigrammatist and nature-lover's gift of affectionate observation. Besides sacred poetry, hagiography flourished from the 6th to the 11th century. This species of literature developed from the old martyrologies, and became the favorite form of popular literature. It flourished from the 8th to the 11th century, and was concerned principally with monastic life. Unfortunately, the rhetorical language was in violent contrast with the simple nature of the contents, so that the chief value of this literature is historical. More popular in style are the biographers of saints of the 6th and 7th centuries. The oldest and most important of them is Cyril of Scythopolis (in Palestine), whose biographies of saints and monks are distinguished for the reliability of their facts and dates. Of great interest also for their contributions to the history of culture and of ethics and for their genuinely popular language are the writings of Leontius, Archbishop of Cyprus (7th century), especially his life of the Patriarch John (surnamed The Merciful), Eleemosynarius of Alexandria. (Cf. Heinrich Gelzer, Kleine Schriften, Leipzig, 1907.) This life describes for us a man who in spite of his peculiarities honestly tried \\"to realize a pure Biblical Christianity of self-sacrificing love\\", and whose life brings before us the customs and ideas of the lower classes of the people of Alexandria. The romance of Balaam and Joasaph (also Barlaam and Josaphat) was another popular work of Byzantine origin now elevated to universal literature. It is the \\"Song of Songs\\" of Christian asceticism, illustrated by the experience of the Indian prince Joasaph, who is led by the hermit Barlaam to abandon the joys of life, and as a true Christian to renounce the world. The material of the story is originally Indian, indeed Buddhistic, for the origin of Joasaph was Buddha. The Greek version originated in the Sabbas monastery in Palestine about the middle of the 7th century. It did not circulate widely until the 11th century, when it became known to all Western Europe through the medium of a Latin translation [Cf. F. C. Conybeare, \\"The Barlaam and Josaphat legend,\\" in Folk-lore (1896), VII, 101 sqq.] The ascetic conception of life was embedded in the Byzantine character and was strengthened by the high development of monastic institutions. The latter in turn brought forth a broad ascetic literature, though it does not further deepen the asceticism of its great exponent, St. Basil of Caesarea. Less extensively cultivated, but excelling in quality, are Byzantine mystical writings. The true founder of a distinctively Byzantine mysticism was Maximus the Confessor (7th century), who deepened the tradition of Christian Neoplatonism, as found in the Pseudo- Dionysius, with the resources of Orthodox Christology. No other writer in Eastern Christian tradition surpasses Maximus in speculative range and originality. Later representatives of this mystical tradition were Symeon the New Theologian and Nicetas Stethatos in the 11th, and Nikolaos Kavasilas in the 14th century. The Byzantine mystical writers differ from those of Western Europe chiefly in their attitude to ecclesiastical ceremonies, to which they adhered implicitly, seeing in it a profound symbol of the spiritual life of the church, where Occidentals see an attempt to displace the inner life with external pomp. Accordingly, Symeon strictly observed the ceremonial rules of the church, regarding them, however, only as a means to the attainment of ethical perfection. His principal work (published only in Latin) is a collection of prose pieces and hymns on communion with God. He is akin to the chief German mystics in his tendency towards pantheism. Of Symeon's equally distinguished pupil, Nicetas Stethatos, we need only say that he cast off his teacher's pantheistic tendencies. The last great mystic Kavasilas, Archbishop of Saloniki, revived the teaching of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, but in the plan of his principal work, \\"Life in Christ\\", exhibits a complete independence of all other worlds and is without a parallel in Byzantine asceticism. = Popular poetry = The capture of Constantinople and establishment of the Latin kingdoms in the year 1204 displaced or supplanted aristocratic and ecclesiastic controls on literary taste and style. In response to new influences from the Latin West, Byzantine popular literature moved in different directions. Whereas literary poetry springs from the rationalistic, classical atmosphere of the Hellenistic period, popular poetry, or folk-song, is an outgrowth of the idyllic, romantic literature of the same period. As the literary works had their prototypes in Lucian, Heliodorus, Achilles Tatius, and Nonnus, the popular works imitated Apollonius of Rhodes, Callimachus, Theocritus, and Musaeus. The chief characteristic of folk-song throughout the Greek Middle Ages is its lyric note, which constantly finds expression in emotional turns. In Byzantine literature, on the other hand, the refinement of erotic poetry was due to the influence of the love-poetry of chivalry introduced by Frankish knights in the 13th century and later. The Byzantines imitated and adapted the romantic and legendary materials these westerners brought. Italian influences led to the revival of the drama. That celebration of the achievements of Greek heroes in popular literature was the result of the conflicts which the Greeks sustained during the Middle Ages with the border nations to the east of the empire. Popular books relating the deeds of ancient heroes had long-standing and widespread currency throughout the East; these too revived heroic poetry, though imparted with a deep romantic tinge. The result was a complete upheaval of popular ideals and a broadening of the popular horizon as Atticist tendencies were gradually eroded. There was, consequently, a complete reconstruction of the literary types of Byzantium. Of all the varieties of artistic poetry there survived only the romance, though this became more serious in its aims, and its province expanded. Of metrical forms there remained only the political (fifteen- syllable) verse. From these simple materials there sprang forth an abundance of new poetic types. Alongside of the narrative romance of heroism and love there sprang up popular love lyrics, and even the beginnings of the modern drama. The Troodos Mountains, from which Digenis Akritas used to jump to Asia Minor in the epic poem The only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the Digenis Akritas, a popular poetic crystallization of the 10th- and 11th- century conflicts between the Byzantine wardens of the marches (Œ±Œ∫œÅŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ, akrites) and the Saracens in Eastern Asia Minor. The nucleus of this epic goes back to the 12th or 13th century, its final literary form to the 15th. Though the schoolmen edited the original poems beyond recognition, an approximate idea of the original poem may be gathered from the numerous echoes of it extant in popular poetry. The existing versions exhibit a blending of several cycles, modeled after the Homeric poems. Its principal subjects are love, adventures, battles, and a patriarchal, idyllic enjoyment of life; it is a mixture of the Iliad and the Odyssey, the majority of the material being drawn from the latter, suffused with a Christian atmosphere. Genuine piety and a strong family feeling combine with an intimate sympathy with nature. Artistically, the work lacks the dramatic quality and diverse characters of the Germanic and classical Greek epics; it must be compared with the Slavic and Oriental heroic songs, among which it properly belongs. The love-romance of the Greek Middle Ages is the result of the fusion of the sophistical Alexandro-Byzantine romance and the medieval French popular romance, on the basis of a Hellenistic view of life and nature. This is proved by its three chief creations, composed in the 13th and 14th centuries. Kallimachos and Chrysorrhoe, Belthandros and Chrysantza, Lybistros and Rhodamne. While the first and the last of these are markedly influenced by Byzantine romance in thought and manner of treatment, the second begins to show the aesthetic and ethical influence of the Old-French romance; indeed, its story often recalls the Tristan legend. The style is clearer and more transparent, the action more dramatic, than in the extant versions of the Digenis legend. The ethical idea is the romantic idea of knighthood‚Äîthe winning of the loved one by valour and daring, not by blind chance as in the Byzantine literary romances. Along with these independent adaptations of French material, are direct translations from \\"Flore et Blanchefleur\\", \\"Pierre et Maguelonne\\", and others, which have passed into the domain of universal literature. To the period of Frankish conquest belongs also the metrical Chronicle of the Morea (14th century). It was composed by a Frank brought up in Greece, though a foe of the Greeks. Its object was, amid the constantly progressing hellenization of the Western conquerors, to remind them of the spirit of their ancestors. Therefore, it is only Greek in language; in literary form and spirit it is wholly Frankish. The author \\"describes minutely the feudal customs which had been transplanted to the soil of Greece, and this perhaps is his chief merit; the deliberations of the High Court are given with the greatest accuracy, and he is quite familiar with the practice of feudal law\\" (J. Schmitt). As early as the 14th century the Chronicle was translated into Spanish and in the 15th into French and Italian. About the same time and in the same locality the small islands off the coast of Asia Minor, appeared the earliest collection of neo-Greek love songs, known as the \\"Rhodian Love-Songs\\". Besides songs of various sorts and origins, they contain a complete romance, told in the form of a play on numbers, a youth being obliged to compose a hundred verses in honor of the maiden whom he worships before she returns his love, each verse corresponding to the numbers one to one hundred. Between the days of the French influence in the 13th and 14th centuries and those of Italian in the 16th and 17th, there was a short romantic and popular revival of the ancient legendary material. There was neither much need nor much appreciation for this revival, and few of the ancient heroes and their heroic deeds are adequately treated. The best of these works is the Alexander Romance, based on the story of Alexander the Great, a revised version of the Pseudo-Callisthenes of the Ptolemaic period, which is also the source of the western versions of the Alexander Romance. The Achilleis, on the other hand, though written in the popular verse and not without taste, is wholly devoid of antique local colour, and is rather a romance of French chivalry than a history of Achilles. Lastly, of two compositions on the Trojan War, one is wholly crude and barbarous, the other, though better, is a literal translation of the old French poem of Beno√Æt de Sainte-More. To these products of the 14th century may be added two of the 16th, both describing a descent into the lower world, evidently popular offshoots of the Timarion and Mazaris already mentioned. To the former corresponds the Apokopos, a satire of the dead on the living; to the latter the Piccatores, a metrical piece decidedly lengthy but rather unpoetic, while the former has many poetical passages (e.g. the procession of the dead) and betrays the influence of Italian literature. In fact Italian literature impressed its popular character on the Greek popular poetry of the 16th and 17th centuries, as French literature had done in the 13th and 14th.  Cretan popular poetry  As a rich popular poetry sprang up during the last- mentioned period on the islands off the coast of Asia Minor, so now a similar literature developed on the island of Crete. Its most important creations are the romantic epic Erotokritos and the dramas Erophile and The Sacrifice of Abraham with a few minor pictures of customs and manners. These works fall chronologically outside the limits of Byzantine literature; nevertheless, as a necessary complement and continuation of the preceding period, they should be discussed here. The Erotokritos is a long romantic poem of chivalry, lyric in characters and didactic in purpose, the work of Vitsentzos Kornaros, a hellenized Venetian of the 16th century. It abounds in themes and ideas drawn from the folk-poetry of the time. In the story of Erotokritos and Arethusa the poet glorifies love and friendship, chivalric courage, constancy, and self- sacrifice. Although foreign influences do not obtrude themselves, and the poem, as a whole, has a national Greek flavour, it reveals the various cultural elements, Byzantine, Romance, and Oriental, without giving, however, the character of a composite. The lyrical love tragedy Erophile is more of a mosaic, being a combination of two Italian tragedies, with the addition of lyrical intermezzos from Torquato Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered, and choral songs from his Aminta. Nevertheless, the materials are handled with independence, and more harmoniously arranged than in the original; the father who has killed his daughter's lover is slain not by his daughter's hand, but by the ladies of his palace, thus giving a less offensive impression. Owing to the lyric undertone of the works some parts of it have survived in popular tradition until the present time. The mystery play of The Sacrifice of Abraham is a little psychological masterpiece, apparently an independent work. The familiar and trite Biblical incidents are reset in the patriarchal environment of Greek family life. The poet emphasizes the mental struggles of Sarah, the resignation of Abraham to the Divine will, the anxious forebodings of Isaac, and the affectionate sympathy of the servants, in other words, a psychological analysis of the characters. The mainspring of the action is Sarah's fore- knowledge of what is to happen, evidently the invention of the poet to display the power of maternal love. The diction is distinguished by high poetic beauty and by a thorough mastery of versification. Other products of Cretan literature are a few adaptations of Italian pastorals, a few erotic and idyllic poems, like the so-called \\"Seduction Tale\\" (an echo of the Rhodian Love-Songs), and the lovely, but ultra-sentimental, pastoral idyll of the Beautiful Shepherdess.  The legacy of Byzantine literature  The Roman supremacy in governmental life did not disappear. The subjection of the Church to the power of the State led to a governmental ecclesiasticism, causing friction with Roman Catholic Church, which had remained relatively independent. Greek eventually overtook Latin as the official language of the government, the \\"Novellae\\" of Justinian I being the last Latin monument. As early as the 7th century Greek language had made great progress, and by the 11th Greek was supreme, though it never supplanted the numerous other languages of the empire. The Eastern Roman Empire divided European civilization into two parts: one Romance and Germanic, the other Greek and Slavic. These cultures differed ethnographically, linguistically, ecclesiastically, and historically. Imperial Russia, the Balkans, and Ottoman Empire were the direct heirs of Byzantine civilization; the first two particularly in ecclesiastical, political, and cultural respects (through the translation and adaptation of sacred, historical, and popular literature); the third in respect to civil government. Indirectly, the Empire protected western Europe for centuries from war, fighting off various invaders and migratory populations. Byzantium was also a treasury of ancient Greek literature. During the Middle Ages, until the capture of the Constantinople, the West was acquainted only with Roman literature. Greek antiquity was first carried to Italy by the treasures brought by fugitive Greek humanists, many of whom were delegates at the Council of Florence from 1431 to 1449. Byzantine culture had a direct influence upon southern and central Europe in church music and church poetry, though this was only in the very early period (until the 7th century). Byzantine culture had a definite impact upon the Near East, especially upon the Persians, and the Arabs.

Life and thought Born in Autrecourt, near Verdun, he was educated at Paris and earned bachelor's degrees in theology and law and a master's degree in arts. Nicholas is known principally for developing skepticism to extreme logical conclusions. He is sometimes considered the sole genuinely skeptic philosopher of medieval times. Nicholas founded his skeptical position on arguments that knowledge claims were not \\"reducible to the first principle,\\" that is, that it was not contradictory to deny them.J. Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 210-216. His views have been compared to those of David Hume, but it has been suggested that the similarities are superficial, and there is no evidence Nicholas influenced Hume, or other modern philosophers such as Ren√© Descartes. Whether Nicholas was committed to skepticism is unclear, but on 19 May 1346 his views were condemned by Pope Clement VI as heretical. Nicholas was sentenced to burn his books publicly and recant, which he did in Paris in 1347. In the 14th century, Nicholas of Autrecourt considered that matter, space, and time were all made up of indivisible atoms, points, and instants and that all generation and corruption took place by the rearrangement of material atoms. The similarities of his ideas with those of al-Ghazali suggest that Nicholas was familiar with the work of al-Ghazali, who was known as \\"Algazel\\" in Europe, either directly or indirectly through Averroes. Much of the extant knowledge of Nicholas of Autrecourt's epistemology derives from one letter written by magister Egidius (master Giles) to Nicholas and an excerpt from his letter in reply to Egidius and from nine letters written by Nicholas to the Franciscan theologian Bernardus Aretinus (Bernard of Arezzo); however, only two of the nine letters survive. Some fragments of the lost letters are quoted in the records of the condemnatory proceedings against Nicholas. Almost nothing is known about these two correspondents.

Sagamu is the largest kola nut collecting center in the country. The kola nut industry supports several secondary industries such as basket and rope manufacturing, which are used to store the kolanuts. The city was founded in the mid-19th century when several small towns united for purpose of defense during the wars brought about by the fall of the Oyo Empire. Sagamu controlled the trade routes between the ports in the Niger Delta and the Yoruba mainland until the British occupied the city at the end of the 19th century.

They were long regarded as being dated circa 138 BCE and 128 BCE, respectively, but recent scholarship has shown it likely they were both written for performance at the Athenian Pythaides in 128 BCE . If indeed it dates from ten years before the second, the First Delphic Hymn is the earliest unambiguous surviving example of notated music from anywhere in the western world whose composer is known by name. History Both Delphic Hymns were addressed to Apollo, and were found inscribed on stone fragments from the south outer wall of the Athenian Treasury at Delphi in 1893 by French archaeologist Th√©ophile Homolle, while Henri Weil restored the Greek text and Th√©odore Reinach transcribed the music to modern notation (; ). Reconstruction of the fragments was facilitated by the fact that the First Hymn uses vocal notation, and the second one employs instrumental notation . It was long believed that all that could be told of the composer of the First Hymn is that it was written by an Athenian, around 138 BCE, since the heading of the inscription giving the name of the composer is damaged and difficult to read. However, careful reading of this inscription shows that it cannot be the ethnic \\"Athena√Æos\\" (from Athens), but rather names \\"Athƒìnaios Athƒìnaiou\\" (Ath√©naios son of Ath√©naios) as the composer (; ). The Second Delphic hymn has been dated to precisely 128 BC; evidently it was first performed in the same year. The name of the composer has also survived, both in the heading of the hymn and in a separate inscription: Limƒìnios, son of Thoinos, an Athenian . The occasion of the performance of both hymns was a Pythaid, a special religious procession of the Athenians towards Delphi held on specific occasions, usually after certain omens. First Delphic Hymn alt= Both hymns are monophonic (consisting of a single melodic line), but are differentiated by their notation. The First Hymn is in so-called vocal notation and it is in the cretic (quintuple) meter throughout . The First Delphic Hymn falls into two large parts, a Paean (lines 1‚Äì27), in three verses, and what might have been called a Hyporchema or dance (lines 27‚Äì34). However, almost all of the last part is lost. =First verse= The image below shows the first verse of the hymn in conventional transcription. The letters above the words represent the notes of music. Various modern recordings of the music can be found in External links (see below). The first stanza of the First Delphic Hymn. The pitch of the transcription is conventional; in performance the pitch would probably have been about a minor third lower (see ). In this verse the singers call on the Muses (goddesses of music and dance) to leave their home on Mount Helicon and to join in the song in honour of Apollo. This part has been translated by Armand D'Angour as follows (): Ten different notes in all are used in this first verse. The fourth note from the bottom (written mu in the Greek alphabet or the note C in the conventional modern transcription) is the so-called mesƒì, or central note, to which the music most often returns . Music with this mese was said to be in the Phrygian mode. There are more notes above the mese than below it. F and B below the mese are not used, and the lowest note, here E, is used only in the first section of the hymn. The note immediately above the mese D (written lambda in Greek) occurs only in one place in section one, in bar 24, but is much more extensively used in verse 2. File:1st delphic hymn.mid The pattern of the music in the first section of the First Delphic Hymn, clearly showing the repeated use of the mesƒì or central note. According to , an archaic pentatonic effect is produced in the lowest tetrachords by avoiding the lichanos, while above the mese there is modulation between a conjunct chromatic tetrachord (C D D F) and a disjunct diatonic one (D E F G), extended by two more chromatic notes, A and A. (A tetrachord is a series of four consecutive notes covering the interval of a fourth, e.g. C, B, A, G; the lichanos (\\"forefinger string\\") was the second note of a tetrachord going down; the \\"conjunct tetrachord\\" is the tetrachord whose lowest note is the mese; and the \\"disjunct tetrachord\\" is the one whose lowest note is the string above the mese .) =Second verse= The second verse describes the presence of the delegation from Attica and the sacrifice of Arabian incense and young bulls that they are making. It also mentions the sound of the pipes (auloi) and the lyre (cithara) accompanying the sacrifice. In this verse there is a change of key; according to it changes from the Phrygian mode to the Hyperphrygian. There is extensive use of the notes (D and D) immediately above the mese, and there is also repeated use of the note B (written with the letter omicron in the Greek notation) immediately below the mese . The strings Greek lyre (cithara) were not tuned in exactly the same way as those of a modern piano, and the intervals from C to D and from D to D were probably less than a modern semitone . Therefore, in this section the music wanders around a small group of closely spaced notes. The technical term for a group of closely spaced notes like this is a pyknon. The text reads : The second verse of the First Delphic Hymn transcribed into modern musical notation. The fourth line, where the music wanders through the narrow range of notes of the pyknon, describes the melody of the aulos or pipe. The photograph below shows part of verse 2 and the beginning of verse 3 on the inscription, starting from the word \\"carrying arms\\" and ending at \\"Attica\\". Photograph of the original stone at Delphi containing the first of the two hymns to Apollo. The music notation is the line of occasional symbols above the main, uninterrupted line of Greek lettering. =Third verse= First Delphic Hymn, 3nd verse The third verse is rather fragmentary, with several gaps in the words and music, but enough survives to make sense of it. In this verse the singers address Apollo directly, and describe how he took over the prophetic tripod at Delphi after killing the snake that guarded it, and how once he thwarted an army of invading Gauls (see: Brennus (3rd century BC)). This verse returns to the same key as the first. As in the first verse, the small intervals above and below the mese are once again not used. There are some octave leaps, and \\"the tone is bright and clear\\" . Second Delphic Hymn 230x230px The Second Hymn is headed Paean and Prosodion to the God and is described as having been composed by Limƒìnios son of Thoinos, an Athenian . It consists of ten sections in all, the first nine in cretic metre constituting the paean, while the tenth in aeolic rhythms (glyconics and choriambic dimeters) is the prosodion. Slightly more lines of the music have survived than in the first hymn, but there are also numerous gaps where the stone has been broken. The style and subject matter of the second hymn is similar to the first, but the musical notation is different. In this hymn the notes are written with the symbols used by instrumental players (see below). divide the hymn up into ten short sections, with frequent changes of key. As in the First Delphic Hymn, the song opens by calling on the Muses to come to Delphi to join in the song in honour of Apollo: The first section of the Second Delphic Hymn (Limenios Paian) transcribed into modern notation. (Places where the stone is broken have been indicated by rests in the music.) The first verse has been translated by J.G. Landels as follows : The hymn goes on to describe how the sky and sea rejoiced at Apollo's birth on the island of Delos, and how Apollo, after his birth, visited Attica; ever since which time the people of Attica have addressed Apollo as \\"Paian\\" (healer) (sections 2‚Äì5). Just as in the first hymn, the singers then address Apollo directly calling on him to come, and remind him how he killed the Python which formerly guarded the Delphic tripod and how he once defeated an army of marauding Gauls with a snowstorm (sections 6‚Äì9). The final part of the work is the prosodion, or processional hymn, with the metre changing from cretic (‚Äì u ‚Äì, with variants u u u ‚Äì and ‚Äì u u u) to glyconic (x x ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì, with variant x x ‚Äì u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì). (The symbol ‚Äì stands for a long syllable, u for a short one, and x x for long-long, long-short, or short- long). In this part, the singers beg Apollo and his sister Artemis (\\"mistress of Cretan bows\\") to protect Athens as well as Delphi, and they close with a prayer for the continued dominion of the victorious Roman empire . A transcription into modern musical notation of the last section of the Second Delphic Hymn, showing its fragmentary condition. The prayer to \\"increase the empire of the Romans\\" is in the last line. The Second Hymn is composed in a different key from the First Hymn. The central note (mese) of the first section is D (in conventional notation), rather than C, making it the Lydian mode . Below the mese are the notes A and B, and above it are E, E, F, and G. The notes used in the second section are different from the first section. B is replaced by B; E and the top G are not used, and a bottom E and a top A are added, so the range of notes is wider. One way of interpreting this is to assume that the music has moved into the Hypolydian mode . Mostly the melody moves up and down in small steps but there are some big jumps occasionally down to the bottom E. According to , the modes of the different sections as follows : # Lydian # Hypolydian # Hypolydian # Chromatic Lydian # Hypolydian # Hypolydian # Chromatic Lydian # Hypolydian # Lydian # Lydian Musical notation The musical symbols used for the hymns can be interpreted thanks to a treatise by Alypius, a musicographer of late antiquity (3rd century A.D.) . Two different notations of music were used, one a series of special signs, perhaps derived from an archaic alphabet, and the other simply the 24 letters of the Ionian alphabet. The first hymn uses the latter system and the Second Hymn the former. But it was possible to use both systems at the same time; if so, the special symbols were used for the instrumental accompaniment, and the Ionic alphabet for the song itself . A suggested reason for the difference in notation in the two hymns is that the author of the first, Athenaios, is listed as a singer, while the author of the second, Limenios, was a cithara- player. One difference between the two notations is that the symbols in the first hymn are placed above the vowels, while those in the Second Hymn are mostly placed above the consonants which begin the syllables . Aftermath These hymns were thoroughly examined by musicologists and there have been many efforts to perform them with replicas of ancient musical instruments. The first modern public performance of the First Hymn was in June 1894, only one year after its discovery, during the international athletic convention in the Sorbonne University in Paris for the establishment of the modern Olympic Games ().

The novel, written in poetic language, takes place at the end of the Neolithic period, as the introduction of bronze tools disrupt the established order. It is narrated by the village storyteller and his \\"daughter\\". Plot summary As a boy, the storyteller lost an arm and became an outcast to the villagers who rely heavily on their stonemasonry skills. The boy leaves the confines of the village, in order to seek a role for himself, and discovers his adeptness at telling stories. The storyteller returns to the village, but most of his time is spent acting as a protector for a widow and her child who had also been forced out of the village, and live two days' walk away. Periodically, he returns to the village charged with new stories to tell. Themes The novel deals with the nature of truth and fiction and storytelling. The reader is often presented with variations of the narrative and invited to judge which, if any, to accept as reality. Like other novels by Crace, it also deals with social change and the effects of revolutionary new technology and as such could be seen as sympathising with the victims of our modern post-industrial age. Crace has said that the novel acts as a metaphor for \\"Thatcherite Britain\\".

Early life Lewis was born in New York City and grew up on the Lower East Side. He attended State University of New York at Purchase, graduating in 1997 with a degree in Literature. His Senior Literary Thesis was on the comic book Watchmen. Lewis also lectured on the topic of Watchmen at the Institute For Cultural Studies at the University of Leuven, Belgium, in 2000, and the text of his lecture (\\"The Dual Nature of Apocalypse in Watchmen\\") was published in the book The Graphic Novel, edited by Jan Baetens, in 2001. Starting in 2000, he spent about two years living in Austin, Texas, playing open mic nights, working odd jobs and distributing his autobiographical comics to local coffee shops. Music Several of his musical influences have been acknowledged in his songs such as \\"Williamsburg Will Oldham Horror\\", \\"The History of The Fall\\" and \\"The Chelsea Hotel Oral Sex Song\\", concerning the song by Leonard Cohen. Lewis' lyrics are complex and literate, often combining a nihilistic world-view with a hopeful message and sharp wit. Growing up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, his songs are also highly informed by his home surroundings, with songs name-dropping places such as Williamsburg, the FDR Drive and the East River. Lewis is often regarded as part of the antifolk movement, foremost because he was one of the many bands and performers (including The Moldy Peaches, Kimya Dawson, Diane Cluck, Regina Spektor, Major Matt Mason USA and Lach) who played in the 1990s at New York's SideWalk Cafe and its biannual antifolk festivals and open mic events. His music also possesses certain traits of a perceived antifolk style ‚Äì a downbeat self-deprecating humor, an off-kilter singing style, a mixture of acoustic and 'punk' songs which feature themes of everyday occurrences and feelings. Lewis himself does not mind the 'antifolk' tag: \\"I think it's a cool title. The fact that no one knows what it means, including me, makes it kind of mysterious and more interesting than saying that you're a singer/songwriter or that you play indie rock.\\" After being signed by the British record label Rough Trade in 2001, Jeffrey Lewis released his first official album The Last Time I Did Acid I Went Insane. Also that year (in February), Lewis was visited by Kimya Dawson while living in Austin, Texas. Over the week she stayed there, they wrote five songs. These songs were later re-recorded with a full band and released by K Records under the moniker \\"The Bundles,\\" on an album of the same name, in 2010. In 2003 Rough Trade released the album It's the Ones Who've Cracked That the Light Shines Through, credited to Jeffrey Lewis with Jack Lewis and drummer Anders Griffen. His third Rough Trade record, City and Eastern Songs, was released in the UK in November 2005 and in the US in September 2006. Most of Lewis's albums also include his brother, Jack Lewis, who wrote or co-wrote and sang and played bass on a number of the songs. In October 2007, Rough Trade released 12 Crass Songs, a Jeffrey Lewis album consisting entirely of songs written by the British punk band Crass, reworked to match Lewis's antifolk style. He has also performed and collaborated with Kimya Dawson of The Moldy Peaches as well as Diane Cluck. Some of his hand-drawn comics appear in the cover art of his CD releases. In June 2008 Jeffrey Lewis with his brother Jack were the support act for Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks in Europe. Other well-known acts that Lewis has performed shows or whole tours with include Devendra Banhart, Jarvis Cocker, Black Dice, Adam Green, Thurston Moore, the Fall, Kimya Dawson, Beth Orton, Frank Black, the Fiery Furnaces, Daniel Johnston, Scout Niblett, the Mountain Goats, Dr. Dog, The Moldy Peaches, Cornershop, Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players, Wooden Wand, the Cribs, Danielson, Herman Dune, Los Campesinos, Roky Erickson, and Super Furry Animals. The New York Times has published his writings and graphic works. The New York Times online Op-Ed page \\"Measure For Measure\\" hired Jeffrey Lewis to write a number of short essays on the topic of songwriting, some of which he drew in comic book form. All went up on The New York Times website at intervals from 2008 to 2013. Lewis has created a number of illustrated historical songs, usually sung while flipping through accompanying books of color drawings, including ten such pieces which are in use by The History Channel on their website. In November 2011 The New York Times ran a feature article on Jeffrey Lewis in the Arts section of November 23, written by Ben Sisario. Lewis published a comic strip in The Guardian newspaper in London. It was entitled \\"What Would Pussy Riot Do?\\" and it was printed on the occasion of a new release of a single with the same title. In a January 2018 \\"MusicMakers\\" interview with Adafruit, Lewis announced he was working on numerous new projects, including \\"Writing a new issue of my comic book series, mastering an album I recorded of covers of Tuli Kupferberg songs, mixing an album I recorded in collaboration with Peter Stampfel, and working on writing and recording new songs with my band for my own next album. Remastering and repackaging my old 2005 album ‚ÄúCity & Eastern Songs\\" for a deluxe vinyl re- issue.\\" Artwork and writing Lewis presenting at London's Rough Trade East in 2011 Bearded. Jeffrey has his own comic book series titled Fuff (formerly called Guff). In March 2009, he designed the cover to the sixth issue of Bearded magazine.

Eventually they began selling juice blends that were originally inspired by a peach nectar Tom First had while on a visit to Spain. Today the brand is owned by Keurig Dr Pepper and offers drinks in several different flavors. The beverage is most commonly sold in 16 fluid ounce glass bottles. The bottle caps feature information about Nantucket Harbor and the history of Nantucket Nectars. The success of \\"Tom and Tom,\\" as the business duo became known, has become a piece of modern business lore. The company was featured on the Inc. 500's list of 500 fastest growing U.S. companies for five years in a row. The story of how they grew their brand is the subject of a popular Harvard Business School case study, which was published in 1998 by Jon Biotti, Joseph Lassiter, William A. Sahlman. History Tom First and Tom Scott met at Brown University in 1985. After graduation, they headed to Nantucket where they started Allserve, a floating convenience store servicing boats in Nantucket Harbor, delivering everything from newspapers to laundry. In 1989, First attempted to recreate a peach drink that he drank on a regular basis while on a trip to Spain for a Nantucket cooking competition. After successfully re-creating the taste, the two began mixing the juice in a blender, pasteurizing it, and bottling it themselves for sale on their boat. Their juice was originally sold for $1 from recycled wine bottles. It was not until later that they decided to call it Nantucket Nectars. One of their first big investors was Michael Egan, who was involved in turning around the Alamo Rent a Car business. They reported $1 million in sales in 1993, $6 million in 1994, and $15 million in 1995. In 1994, they decided to focus solely on creating and selling their juices. The business then moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ocean Spray purchased an 80% stake in Nantucket Nectars in 1997 and then sold to London-based Cadbury Schweppes PLC in 2002. The brand is currently owned by Plano, TX-based Dr Pepper Snapple Group. The founders are no longer involved in the day-to-day operations, but still perform marketing duties and voice the radio ads. On radio and for other advertisements, Tom and Tom often refer to themselves as the \\"Juice Guys\\". Flavors Nantucket Nectars come in a variety of different flavors.

Zhang Rang and the eunuchs secretly instructed the investigators to frame Zhang Jun for learning the ways of the Taiping Sect; Zhang Jun was imprisoned and tortured, and eventually died in prison.(Ë©î‰ΩøÂª∑Â∞â„ÄÅ‰æçÂæ°Âè≤ËÄÉÁÇ∫ÂºµËßíÈÅìËÄÖÔºåÂæ°Âè≤ÊâøËÆìÁ≠âÊó®ÔºåÈÅÇË™£Â•èÈàûÂ≠∏ÈªÉÂ∑æÈÅìÔºåÊî∂Êé†Ê≠ªÁçÑ‰∏≠„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 78. The eunuchs themselves were, in fact, secretly in contact or collaborating with Zhang Jue. After two eunuchs, Feng Xu (Â∞ÅË´ù) and Xu Feng (ÂæêÂ•â), were caught and executed, an angry Emperor Ling scolded the eunuchs, \\"You often say the officials were up to no good. Some of them have been imprisoned while others were executed. Now they are the ones who prove to be useful for the Empire, while you're the ones working with Zhang Jue. So whom should I execute?\\" The eunuchs begged for mercy and pushed the blame to Wang Fu (ÁéãÁî´) and Hou Lan (‰æØË¶Ω).

His housekeepers built networks with other influential persons and accepted bribes. There was one Meng Tuo (Â≠ü‰Ωó) from Fufeng Commandery (Êâ∂È¢®ÈÉ°) who gave all his family fortune as a gift to one of Zhang Rang's housekeepers. The housekeeper, grateful for the generous gift, asked him what he wanted in return. Meng Tuo said that all he wanted was to meet Zhang Rang. Around the time, there were many people seeking an audience with Zhang Rang; these people, bringing along carts filled with gifts, formed a long queue outside Zhang Rang's residence. Meng Tuo showed up late so he could not enter. To his surprise, the housekeeper, whom he befriended, came out to welcome him like an honoured guest and instructed the servants to carry him into Zhang Rang's residence. The other visitors saw that and thought that he was a special friend of Zhang Rang, so they eagerly showered him with gifts to flatter him. When Meng Tuo met Zhang Rang later, he gave some of the gifts he received to the latter, who was delighted. Zhang Rang later helped Meng Tuo become the Inspector (Âà∫Âè≤) of Liang Province.(ËÆìÊúâÁõ£Â•¥ÂÖ∏‰ªªÂÆ∂‰∫ãÔºå‰∫§ÈÄöË≤®Ë≥ÇÔºåÂ®ÅÂΩ¢Ë´†Ëµ´„ÄÇÊâ∂È¢®‰∫∫Â≠ü‰ΩóÔºåË≥áÁî¢È•íË¥çÔºåËàáÂ•¥ÊúãÁµêÔºåÂÇæÁ´≠È•ãÂïèÔºåÁÑ°ÊâÄÈÅ∫ÊÑõ„ÄÇÂ•¥Âí∏Âæ∑‰πãÔºåÂïè‰ΩóÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêõ‰ΩïÊâÄÊ¨≤ÔºüÂäõËÉΩËæ¶‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêæÊúõÊ±ùÊõπÁÇ∫Êàë‰∏ÄÊãúËÄ≥„ÄÇ„ÄçÊôÇË≥îÂÆ¢Ê±ÇË¨ÅËÆìËÄÖÔºåËªäÊÅíÊï∏ÁôæÂçÉÂÖ©Ôºå‰ΩóÊôÇË©£ËÆìÔºåÂæåËá≥Ôºå‰∏çÂæóÈÄ≤ÔºåÁõ£Â•¥‰πÉÁéáË´∏ÂÄâÈ†≠ËøéÊãúÊñºË∑ØÔºåÈÅÇÂÖ±ËΩùËªäÂÖ•ÈñÄ„ÄÇË≥îÂÆ¢Âí∏È©öÔºåË¨Ç‰ΩóÂñÑÊñºËÆìÔºåÁöÜÁà≠‰ª•ÁèçÁé©Ë≥Ç‰πã„ÄÇ‰ΩóÂàÜ‰ª•ÈÅ∫ËÆìÔºåËÆìÂ§ßÂñúÔºåÈÅÇ‰ª•‰ΩóÁÇ∫Ê∂ºÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 78. In 185, when a fire broke out in the southern part of the imperial palace, the Ten Attendants suggested to Emperor Ling to levy a tax of ten maces from every mu of farmland to raise funds for rebuilding the palace. Emperor Ling then ordered the officials in Taiyuan (Â§™Âéü), Hedong (Ê≤≥Êù±) and Didao (ÁãÑÈÅì) commanderies to transport wood and patterned rocks to Luoyang (the imperial capital) as construction materials. When the shipments reached the palace, the eunuchs who received them scolded the labourers for delivering materials of poor quality, and insisted on paying them far below market prices ‚Äì to as low as a tenth of the market price. They then resold the materials to other eunuchs, who refused to buy. Over time, the accumulated piles of wood started decaying. The construction works were thus delayed for years. In order to please Emperor Ling, some regional officials levied heavier taxes and forced the people to produce greater quantities of construction materials ‚Äì this led to greater resentment from the common people.(ÊòéÂπ¥ÔºåÂçóÂÆÆÁÅΩ„ÄÇËÆì„ÄÅÂø†Á≠âË™™Â∏ù‰ª§ÊñÇÂ§©‰∏ãÁî∞ÁïíÁ®ÖÂçÅÈå¢Ôºå‰ª•‰øÆÂÆÆÂÆ§„ÄÇÁôºÂ§™Âéü„ÄÅÊ≤≥Êù±„ÄÅÁãÑÈÅìË´∏ÈÉ°ÊùêÊú®ÂèäÊñáÁü≥ÔºåÊØèÂ∑ûÈÉ°ÈÉ®ÈÄÅËá≥‰∫¨Â∏´ÔºåÈªÉÈñÄÂ∏∏‰æçËºí‰ª§Ë≠¥Âëµ‰∏ç‰∏≠ËÄÖÔºåÂõ†Âº∑ÊäòË≥§Ë≤∑ÔºåÂçÅÂàÜÈõá‰∏ÄÔºåÂõ†Âæ©Ë≤®‰πãÊñºÂÆ¶ÂÆòÔºåÂæ©‰∏çÁÇ∫Âç≥ÂèóÔºåÊùêÊú®ÈÅÇËá≥ËÖêÁ©çÔºåÂÆÆÂÆ§ÈÄ£Âπ¥‰∏çÊàê„ÄÇÂà∫Âè≤„ÄÅÂ§™ÂÆàÂæ©Â¢ûÁßÅË™øÔºåÁôæÂßìÂëºÂóü„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 78.

As the eunuchs were highly trusted and favoured by Emperor Ling, they behaved lawlessly and abused their power. They even built lavish mansions for themselves in the same design as the imperial palace. When Emperor Ling once visited Yong'anhou Platform (Ê∞∏ÂÆâ‰æØËá∫), a high viewing platform, the eunuchs were worried that he would see their mansions and become suspicious. Thus, they told him, \\"Your Majesty shouldn't put yourself on higher ground.

He also ordered coins to be minted and widely circulated. Many people perceived this to be a display of the emperor's extravagance, and pointed to signs showing that the coins will eventually scatter everywhere.

Downfall of the eunuch faction When Emperor Ling became critically ill in 189, he secretly entrusted his younger son, Liu Xie, then about eight years old, to a close aide and eunuch, Jian Shuo. Upon the emperor's death, Jian Shuo attempted to install Liu Xie on the throne but his plan failed. Emperor Ling's older son, the 13-year-old Liu Bian, became emperor instead and was known as Emperor Shao.

Lu Zhi intercepted the eunuch Duan Gui (ÊÆµÁè™) and saved the empress dowager from him.(ÈÄ≤ÈÉ®Êõ≤Â∞áÂê≥Âå°„ÄÅÂºµÁíãÔºåÁ¥†ÊâÄË¶™Âπ∏ÔºåÂú®Â§ñËÅûÈÄ≤Ë¢´ÂÆ≥ÔºåÊ¨≤Â∞áÂÖµÂÖ•ÂÆÆÔºåÂÆÆÈñ§Èñâ„ÄÇË¢ÅË°ìËàáÂå°ÂÖ±Êñ´Êîª‰πãÔºå‰∏≠ÈªÉÈñÄÊåÅÂÖµÂÆàÈñ§„ÄÇÊúÉÊó•ÊöÆÔºåË°ìÂõ†ÁáíÂçóÂÆÆ‰πùÈæçÈñÄÂèäÊù±Ë•øÂÆÆÔºåÊ¨≤‰ª•ËÑÖÂá∫ËÆìÁ≠â„ÄÇËÆìÁ≠âÂÖ•ÁôΩÂ§™ÂêéÔºåË®ÄÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÂÖµÂèçÔºåÁáíÂÆÆÔºåÊîªÂ∞öÊõ∏Èó•ÔºåÂõ†Â∞áÂ§™Âêé„ÄÅÂ§©Â≠êÂèäÈô≥ÁïôÁéãÔºåÂèàÂä´ÁúÅÂÖßÂÆòÂ±¨ÔºåÂæûË§áÈÅìËµ∞ÂåóÂÆÆ„ÄÇÂ∞öÊõ∏ÁõßÊ§çÂü∑ÊààÊñºÈñ£ÈÅì‰Ü´‰∏ãÔºå‰ª∞Êï∏ÊÆµÁè™„ÄÇÊÆµÁè™Á≠âÊáºÔºå‰πÉÈáãÂ§™Âêé„ÄÇÂ§™ÂêéÊäïÈñ£ÂæóÂÖç„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 69.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms The Ten Attendants appear at the beginning of the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events leading to the end of the Han dynasty and through the Three Kingdoms period of China. The ten listed in the novel were: * Feng Xu (Â∞ÅË´ù), executed in 184 for conspiring with the Yellow Turban rebels * Jian Shuo (ËπáÁ¢©), killed by Guo Sheng for attempting to assassinate He Jin * Zhao Zhong (Ë∂ôÂø†), killed by Yuan Shu and Wu Kuang (Âê≥Âå°) * Guo Sheng (ÈÉ≠Âãù), killed by Yuan Shu and Wu Kuang * Xia Yun (Â§èÊÉ≤), killed by Yuan Shu and Wu Kuang * Cheng Kuang (Á®ãÊõ†), killed by Yuan Shu and Wu Kuang * Zhang Rang (ÂºµËÆì), drowned * Duan Gui (ÊÆµÁè™), killed by Min Gong (ÈñîË≤¢) * Hou Lan (‰æØË¶Ω) * Cao Jie (ÊõπÁØÄ) Five of these ten eunuchs were not among the historical Ten Attendants: Cheng Kuang is a fictional character; Feng Xu and Jian Shuo existed historically, but were not listed among the Ten Attendants in the Book of the Later Han; Hou Lan and Cao Jie died in 172 and 181 respectively so they could not have been present when the events of the novel took place. In popular culture The Ten Attendants appear in Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series, specifically in Dynasty Warriors 4: Xtreme Legends (Dong Zhuo's story mode), Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends, and Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends (L√º Bu's story mode).

Decisionmaking During the 1982 War, 1986, p. 7 Wafa provides daily news from Palestinian territories, Israel and the Middle East, and is available in English, Arabic, French and Hebrew, making it a major source of information over current events for those regions. Wafa, like PNA's other media outlets, are considered to be aligned with Fatah. Following a decision at the Palestinian National Council's special session in Cairo in April 1972, the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization announced the establishment of Wafa in Beirut on June 5, 1972. The same year Radio Palestine was also founded. While initially Wafa focused on giving official statements, its work gradually expanded to include different types of news. It began issuing felasteen el-thawra (meaning \\"Palestinian revolution\\"), a weekly magazine headed by Ahmed Abdel-Rahman. During PLO's presence in Lebanon, Wafa was frequently quoted by foreign correspondents and news agencies. According to Kenneth R. Timmerman, writing for Commentary, Wafa was instrumental in shaping the Western narrative of the 1982 Lebanon War: Following PLO's ouster from Lebanon, Wafa resumed activities in Cyprus and Tunis in November, 1982. In 1994, PLO's institutions repatriated to the Palestinian territories as a consequence of the Oslo Accords. Palestine TV, Voice of Palestine, the daily Al-Hayat al-Jadida, and Wafa became the primary media channels for the newly established Palestinian National Authority. Wafa opened offices in Gaza City and Ramallah. In April 2005, Mahmoud Abbas transferred PNA's media assets that were under the control of the presidency to the Ministry of Information under Nabil Shaath. At the same time, he merged the General Information Commission into Wafa. Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and to preempt Hamas from asserting control of the media assets, Abbas transferred them back to the presidential office. In October 2005, Wafa re-launched its French service. The French service had previously operated in Tunisia until 1994. In September 2006, gunmen stormed Wafa's offices in Khan Younis and smashed equipment and beat up one reporter. In 2009, Wafa launched a Hebrew version of its website; the content of this service would focus on Arab citizens of Israel, many of whom identify as Palestinian. It also started mailing a daily newsletter to Israeli members of the Knesset and Hebrew media outlets. On December 10, 2018, Israeli soldiers raided Wafa's offices in Ramallah and fired tear gas into the building. The Palestinian Journalists' Union, the Palestinian foreign ministry, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the International Federation of Journalists In 2019, Wafa won the Federation of Arab News Agencies's award for best report.  Public service media  According to an UNESCO study, the Palestinian publicly-owned media has privileged access to information from the government and sometimes exclusive access to events. This perceived favoring means that private media often has to rely on reporting from Wafa or broadcasts on Palestine TV. The study therefore recommends that the PNA's media assets; Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation (Voice of Palestine and Palestine TV), Wafa, and Al-Hayat al- Jadida should be transformed into independent, public service media.

The most widely known version, the Modern Age villain that first appeared in 1965, is a long-time and highly dangerous opponent of the Justice League. The character continues to appear in Justice League and Batman comics, with a ghoulish (rather than human) appearance since 1997. Publication history The original Key first appeared in All Star Comics #57 and was created by John Broome and Frank Giacoia. The second Key first appeared in Justice League of America #41 and was created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky. Fictional character biography =Golden Age Key= The Golden Age Key's sole appearance was in All Star Comics #57 (March 1951), which featured the last Golden Age appearance of the Justice Society of America. In this story, the Key is the head of a major crime syndicate and uses various agents around the world to engage in crime. While escaping from the Justice Society in a cable car moving over a gorge, the Key leaps out to avoid capture, presumably falling to his death (this version of the Key has not been seen since).All Star Comics #57 (March 1951). =Modern Age Key= The second Key debuted in Justice League of America #41 (December 1965). The unidentified man known as the Key develops mind-expanding \\"psycho-chemicals\\" that activate his 10 senses. Assisted by henchmen known as \\"Key-Men\\" and a \\"key blaster\\" gun, the Key has several failed run-ins with the Justice League of America (JLA). The Key first drugs the Leaguers, which not only causes them to disband the Justice League, but also physically blinds them to the existence of the Key and his Key-Men. The Key fails to take into account Hawkman's sidekick, Hawkgirl, who frees him from the drug's effects. They free the other Leaguers, and the Key is imprisoned. The Key returns three years later. During his last attack on the League, he left a subconscious command in their minds that would not allow them to leave the League's headquarters for one hour. At the end of that time, each Leaguer would turn on another and kill him or her. Superman defeats the Key by going back in time and sending his un-hypnotized self forward in time. He defeats each Leaguer in turn, and then imprisons the Key in the Fortress of Solitude in suspended animation.Justice League of America #63 (June 1968). The Key appeared to die six years later. He wires an entire city block of St. Louis, Missouri, with bombs, forcing the Justice League to pass through a series of traps to reach the device which will stop the detonation. The Key reveals that he was freed by a judge who found Superman's actions an unconstitutional use of cruel and unusual punishment. Incarcerated in a regular prison, he learns the psychoactive drugs he has taken have left him mere months to live. Released on humanitarian grounds, he attempts to destroy the League. The Phantom Stranger impersonates one of the Key-Men, helping to save the League. Green Lantern John Stewart uses his power ring to drive the explosive force of the bombs down into the ground, and the Key escapes at the last moment.Justice League of America #110 (March 1974). The Key appears again in Justice League of America #150 (January 1978). The Manhunter Mark Shaw has given up his old identity to become a new hero named the Privateer.Justice League of America #140 (March 1977); Justice League of America #141 (April 1977); Justice League of America #143 (June 1977). Doctor Light attempts to gain access to the Justice League Satellite, but is driven off by the Privateer. Light encounters a new villain, the Star-Tsar, and they briefly engage in battle. When former League mascot Snapper Carr is discovered near the site of a battle with the Star-Tsar's henchmen, the Star Lords, the League becomes suspicious and travels to Snapper's home to speak with the Carr family. Light traps the League in his \\"Spetriminator\\", but they free themselves. They rush off to find Light, but instead encounter an unconscious Star-Tsar‚Äîwho is unmasked as Snapper Carr. Star-Tsar is freed by his henchmen, but their getaway vehicles leave behind a distinctive radioactive trace. Several League members trace this trail to the Star-Tsar's lair, where they are captured by the \\"real\\" Star-Tsar (who has imprisoned Carr). The League free themselves and the \\"real\\" Star-Tsar is discovered to be the Key. The Key reveals that the bombs he used in St. Louis were \\"stellar bombs\\" designed to give off a peculiar kind of radiation. When the Green Lantern John Stewart used his power ring to contain the blast, it drove the radiation downward into the Key's subterranean lair where the Key had prepared machinery to utilize the radiation and prevent his death. But the dying Key was only able to close his machinery over his head. The Key's body survived albeit in a dwarfish form, while his head remained life-size. Building a robotic body for himself, he approached a disillusioned Carr, provided him with weapons and henchmen, and launched his latest attack on the Justice League. The Red Tornado, however, discloses that the Key is not the real Star-Tsar, either: Mark Shaw is. Shaw came up with the villainous identity and approached the Key for help, which the Key gave. But when Shaw refused to work with the Key, the Key manufactured a mechanical Star-Tsar body and used Snapper Carr to carry out the Key/Star-Tsar's more athletic crimes (Since the Key/Star-Tsar could appear alongside Snapper, no suspicion would fall on Snapper). Still in his dwarfish, barely mobile form, the Key attempts to cure himself a few years later by reactivating the android Amazo, which was stored aboard the Justice League Satellite. He hopes that by absorbing the League's powers, his body can be restored. New League member Zatanna uses magic to cure the Key, restoring the powers to the League (who subdue Amazo).Justice League of America #191 (June 1981). The Key makes a cameo appearance in Justice League of America #240 (July 1985). The time-traveling villain Dr. Anomaly observes the Key's second battle with the Justice League before launching his own attack on the superhero group. The most recent incarnation of the Key is introduced in JLA #6 (June 1997), by Howard Porter and Grant Morrison, in a teaser at the beginning of the issue. The Moon begins to fall out of orbit in JLA #7 (July 1997), and the Key is seen to not be responsible. As the Leaguers return to the Justice League Watchtower on the Moon, the Key immobilizes them. The Key's new look is explained in JLA #8 (August 1997): The Key spent years in a drug- induced coma to unlock even more potential in his brain. The \\"psycho- chemicals\\" altered his appearance so that now the Key is a pale, cadaverous, white-haired humanoid with greatly heightened mental abilities. The Key uses a programmable \\"psycho-virus\\" to knock the Justice League's members unconscious and trap them in a dream that they all share (a fantastic type of dream telepathy). The Key states he is counting on the heroes' known aptitude for dispelling such illusions, and that as they wake, he intends to siphon off the resulting energy to open a door to creation and become the center of the universe. Most of JLA #8 and JLA #9 (September 1997) consists of stories occurring in these fantasy realms‚Äîincluding Kal-El as the Green Lantern of Sector 2813 on a still-existent Krypton, a now-retired Bruce Wayne going back into action when Tim Drake and Wayne's son face the Joker (who is dying of cancer), Aquaman in a time where Earth has been virtually flooded, and a powerless Wonder Woman facing Nazi archaeologists and demons. The Key almost succeeds in killing the heroes. The League is saved when the new Green Arrow, Connor Hawke, teleports to the JLA headquarters to attend a pre-arranged meeting to discuss becoming a member of the League. Hawke attacks the Key before he can complete his goal. The Key is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum, where the Martian Manhunter puts him in a \\"mental maze\\" (a form of coma). The Key next appears in Gotham City, where he uses his psycho-chemicals to remove Batman's inhibition against killing. The Key's goal is to have Batman kill him, so that he might unlock the secret of death. Batgirl and Azrael must prevent Batman from committing murder until the drug wears off.Batman: Gotham Knights #5 (July 2000). The Key makes an appearance, along with a large group of villains, attacking the Justice League and Marvel Comics' the Avengers in 2003.Avengers/JLA #3 (December 2003). The JLA disbands in the \\"World without a Justice League\\" storyline in 2006, in which the Key plays a major part. The Key emerges from the \\"mental maze\\" with his telepathic powers even more greatly enhanced. Unable to shut out the voices of millions of people, the Key comes close to insanity before realizing that killing people helps calm the voices. The Key commits a large number of murders in Metropolis, which the Justice League investigates. The Key kidnaps the heroine sorceress Manitou Dawn, and attempts to merge his mind with hers in order to wipe all human life from Earth. The League stops him, but his new Key-Man android delays the heroes long enough to allow him to escape. The Key mentally orders thousands of people to kill one another. As the League separately battles the Seven Deadly Sins, the personification of Envy tries to stop the Key in order to keep envy (a human emotion) alive. Envy tries to use the Key to enter the minds of millions of people and listen to their seedy thoughts, but the Key resists and breaks free‚Äîforcing a temporarily unpowered Envy to flee. The Key begs Manitou Dawn to kill him, but she sends him to a \\"dream plane\\" instead, where he will hear no voices and can be at peace.JLA #120-125 (December 2005-April 2006) During the Infinite Crisis miniseries, the Key is shown during the Battle of Metropolis,Infinite Crisis Special: Villains United (April 2006). although whether this takes place just before the events of \\"World without a Justice League\\" or after is not clear. He is later briefly seen to be a member of the Injustice League.Justice League of America Wedding Special (November 2007). The Key reappears in Justice League of America (volume 2) #17-18 (March-April 2008), although neither his cure nor his escape from the \\"dream plane\\" are explained. The Suicide Squad is collecting the world's supervillains to send them to the prison planet Salvation. Several villains, led by the Key, take refuge with the Justice League and are imprisoned. The villains assume that, once the danger of exile is past, the Key will be able to free them whenever they wish, but a dampening field in the prison prevents the Key from using his enhanced intelligence. The Key next appears having escaped from the Justice League's prison (somehow), and is briefly depicted as a member of the Secret Society of Super-Villains.Justice League of America (volume 2) #21 (July 2008). He is next seen meeting with the supervillain Roulette a year later to receive information she had collected on the League.Justice League of America (volume 2) #37 (November 2009). The Key is apparently working for someone else, but who it is, is never revealed. The Key's next major appearance came in Batman: The Dark Knight (volume 2) #1 (November 2011). The Key is depicted incarcerated in Arkham Asylum (although how he got there is unclear). An aggression-enhancing toxin is released into the air at Arkham, and Batman must battle the Key and a number of other villains as he penetrates the hospital to reach Two-Face. The Key makes another major appearance in the Justice League comic a year later, when he is freed from his cell during a riot at Arkham Asylum. Although quickly captured by Batman, Superman and Cyborg, the Key reveals that he and the Weapons Master were broken out of their cells only so that they could be interrogated by a new villain, David Graves, who wanted to know the weaknesses of the Justice League.Justice League (volume 2) #9 (May 2012) The Key's most recent appearance was in Black Canary and Zatanna: Bloodspell (July 2014), where he appears in flashback. =DC Rebirth= Talking with an unspecified force that is implied to be trapped, as seen during the DC Rebirth reboot, the Key captures Batman, Nightwing, Wonder Woman, Donna Troy, Barry Allen, Wally West, Aquaman and Tempest and traps them in a specially designed prison, with the goal of driving the mentors and prot√©g√©s to destroy each other by exploiting their differences and paranoia. However, the heroes manage to overcome the Key's attempt to keep them divided and they attack him directly, forcing the Key to withdraw without gathering sufficient power to release his unknown associate.Titans Annual (vol. 3) #1 Powers and abilities Originally, the modern-age Key carried a blaster in the shape of a key. The psycho-chemicals he created also allowed him to access the 90 percent of the human brain that is untapped. This vastly increased his intelligence and expanded his range of senses. The modern-age Key also had a large number of henchmen known as Key- Men, who acted as bodyguards and who had enough limited fighting skills to delay heroes (and allow the Key to effect an escape). The modern-age Key, in both his incarnations, is a master of chemistry, and utilizes chemicals (most often in the form of drugs) as weapons. The modern-age Key used drugs to bend the Justice League to his will twice, and Batman once. More recently, the Key created a programmable psycho-virus that initiates a dream-like state that allows the Key to produce structured hallucinations. He created a machine that allowed him to steal energy from the mind of the infected person, and conceivably could make him the most powerful telepath in the universe (even able to open dimensional doorways at will). The Key has shown an extraordinary capacity for creating androids and various kinds of machines. Aside from building his own Key-Man servant (which has some resistance to physical attacks and limited offensive capabilities), he was able to control the highly advanced Amazo android as well. The Key built weapons and other devices capable of harnessing stellar radiation for their power, altering the Moon's orbit, harnessing dream-energy, and regenerating his own body using radiation. On one occasion, the Key developed a \\"vibrational prison\\" which was capable of immobilizing a wide range of heroes (including Superman). More recently, the Key altered his key-blaster so that instead of firing energy bolts, it fires psycho-chemicals which can disable practically any living organism. Other versions The Key appears in the DC Super Friends comics. In other media =Television= * The Key appears in his modern-age original incarnation in Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Corey Burton. A member of the Secret Society, his skills seem more oriented to penetrating secure areas with a key- shaped gun that can easily open doors as well as fulfill mundane ballistic means. In the episode \\"I Am Legion\\", the Key also displayed some form of intangibility to save Lex Luthor from a police manhunt. In an audio commentary, the series producers said that the Key was originally going to be possessed by, or be connected to, Brainiac, and play an important role in the season finale.Justice League Unlimited Season Two, commentary on Alive However, this idea was dropped in favor of resurrecting Darkseid. In the series finale, the Key sided against Gorilla Grodd and was subsequently frozen by Killer Frost and was blown up by Darkseid along with the other villains. * The Key appears in his modern-age original incarnation in the Beware the Batman episode \\"Animal\\", voiced by JB Blanc. He is depicted as a short, old shopkeeper with the ability to mold his fingers into any key fitting a lock, and is able to download digital security keys from computers into his brain. The Key also acts as an expert forger, creating new identities for a high price. The Key downloads an important security code worth a fortune, and is defeated by Batman and placed in Blackgate Penitentiary. Batman has himself arrested to go after the Key before he breaks out, but the thief is kidnapped by Killer Croc and his men. Batman and Croc fight over who gets to keep the Key. After Batman brutally beats Croc, he convinces the Key to break out of prison with him. Batman hands him over to Commissioner Gordon. In the episode \\"Twist\\", the Key is revealed to have been paid by Slade Wilson to create his new identity as \\"Dane Lisslow\\" in order to fake his death and begin an elaborate revenge scheme against Alfred Pennyworth. The Key is interrogated by Batman and Katana and later arrested by the police. =Film= The Key has a cameo appearance in the animated film Justice League: The New Frontier. He is seen during the famous speech by John F. Kennedy. =Video games= The Key appears in his modern-age altered incarnation in Justice League Heroes, voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. He is the third game boss and one of Brainiac's allies. =Miscellaneous= * The Key appears in a 1992 issue of Green Lantern Corps Quarterly. Each issue of the comic featured several stories, each involving a different Green Lantern. In the short story \\"G'nortin' But Trouble\\", the Green Lantern G'nort briefly battles several villains, the Key (in his modern-age original incarnation) among them.Green Lantern Corps Quarterly #3 (December 1992). * The Key appears in issue #5 of the out-of-continuity children's comic book Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The Key's appearance here is in his modern-age original incarnation. Like the animated television series Batman: The Brave and the Bold which inspired it, the comic begins with a short cold open story in which Batman and another hero team up briefly to swiftly defeat a supervillain. In this issue, Batman teams up with the Haunted Tank to defeat the Key.Batman: The Brave and the Bold #5 (July 2009).

He is best known for low budget horror movies such as Twist Craze and The Giant Spider Invasion. Rebane also ran for the governor of Wisconsin in 1979 and 2002 as the American Reform Party candidate. Biography Rebane came to the United States from Latvia in 1952 at age 15. His mother was Latvian and his father, Arnold Rebane, was Estonian. He attended school in post-war Germany as a child, becoming conversant in four languages: Estonian, Latvian, German and Russian. By watching American cinema, he was able to master English. He attended the Art Institute of Chicago/Goodman Theatre, majoring in drama.  Accomplishments  Rebane is credited with the introduction of the first 360 degree (wrap around) motion picture process to the Motion Picture Industry of the world, an innovation that spurred the Cinemax process and today's Rotascope cameras; as the creator of the Wisconsin Film Office; as the producer, director, writer, and cinematographer on 12 independent feature films, all of which have enjoyed successful international theatrical release; as producer/director of one of the fifty top-grossing films of 1975 (The Giant Spider Invasion, $23 million gross); as having produced, directed, edited, and production designed at least one hundred commercial, industrial, corporate image, documentary or promotion films; and for the creation and successful operation of the first full-time feature film studio in the Midwest for over 30 years. = Recognition = In October 2009, Rebane received the Wisconsin Filmmaker 'Lifetime Achievement Award', presented to him at the 2009 Madison Horror Film Festival.  Career  = Post-college = Rebane's first positions in media included working for WGN-TV in Chicago, where he worked his way through the ranks, beginning with a position in the mailroom, and then as floor manager, assistant producer, and assistant to executive producer. Partaking in production of various live television broadcasts, also allowed him the opportunities as an actor and singer, resulting in appearances on such shows as the courtroom drama series They Stand Accused and the syndicated musical-variety series The International Cafe. = Baltes and Cinema Scope = Rebane returned to Germany at age 19, where he met and worked with producer Adalbert Baltes of Hamburg, Germany. Rebane credits working with Baltes as his start in the film industry. After working with Baltes as a production assistant, assistant director, and director on various 'Cinema Scope Theatrical Short Subjects' for 'Baltes Film', Rebane obtained the U.S. rights to the 'Cinetarium' circular motion picture process. Rebane returned to the U.S. and introduced the proprietary process to the world film industry through United Film and Recording Studios in Chicago, attracting such notables as Samuel Goldwyn, Roy Disney, Jack L. Warner, Hugh Hefner and Mike Todd, Jr. to the process, along with industry professionals from Russia, central Europe and Japan. By age 22, Rebane was a millionaire. However, his early wealth was temporary, as costs of patents, legal fees and research into means to manufacture vertical projection systems were at the time beyond the financial means of the companies he had formed for development of the process. = Early film production = Rebane then turned to film production. His first independent production effort was the ten-minute musical theatrical short subject called Twist Craze which was purchased by American International Pictures. The film became an international success both theatrically and financially, and enjoyed a 10-week holdover at the Oriental Theater in Chicago, which until that time, was an unheard phenomenon for independent short subject theatrical productions. The film earned twenty times its production cost. Rebane followed this success with a 20-minute theatrical musical short titled Dance Craze, which surpassed the success of Twist Craze, ultimately being purchased by Crown International Pictures for international release. = Radio = Rebane's interests in media, and performance, and with the professional contacts he had made, led to his position as co-host of the Germania broadcast at Chicago's WGES radio station, at the time the largest and most popular German-language broadcast in America. As a daily evening one- hour live show, it allowed Rebane to create, produce, and host other radio shows on WKFM, Chicago's first FM station, as well as leaving time open for his day job as national public relations director and assistant advertising director for the American distributor for the German firm Grundig Radio. = First science fiction project = In 1961 Rebane decided to make a feature film, and in 1963 he began production of the science fiction feature film Terror at Halfday, starring June Travis and Peter Thompson, which marked Rebane's becoming the first producer in Chicago to tackle an independent feature film production with a full union crew and screen actors guild talent. A chance meeting with Ronald Reagan nearly attached Reagan to the film. however, Rebane's financial contacts would not go along, claiming Reagan was a \\"has been\\" and not worth the investment. Unable to finance the completion of the film, Rebane sold his completed footage to Herschell Gordon Lewis. Lewis went on to complete the film and release the film as Monster A Go-Go in 1965. =Studio Bendestorf= At age 23, Rebane returned to Germany as executive-in- charge of U.S. co-productions for 'Studio Bendestorf', in Bendestorf, Germany, in which he had an interest, opening offices in Chicago and Hollywood. Commuting to and from Germany on a bi-weekly basis, Rebane dealt with the major studios to attract producers to Germany and lower costs of production. Some films which found a partial or full home for production at Rebane's Bendestorf Studio facility and through Rebane's contact efforts included Dollars (Goldie Hawn / Scott Brady), How I Won the War (John Lennon), and The Odessa File (Jon Voight). = The Shooting Ranch = In the late 1960s, Rebane purchased a farm property near Gleason, Wisconsin and moved there with his family. Apart from the property being used to raise cattle and horses, it also eventually became home to Rebane's studio 'The Shooting Ranch', the facility which was the first full-time feature film studio in the Midwest. 'The Shooting Ranch', held the position of \\"first and only\\" for over 30 years, eventually growing to , and producing hundreds of commercials, industrial, and corporate image films, plus a number of theatrical features for international theatrical distribution and exposure. Rebane acknowledges fellow filmmaker, producer Jerry Gregoris of Chicago, for allowing Rebane directorial and post- production responsibilities and subsequent credits on industrial films made for such clients as the Teamsters union, the Republican Party of Indiana, State Farm Insurance, the City of Chicago, and Wausau Insurance. Rebane used his studio to produce and direct a number of sci-fi/horror films, the first being Invasion from Inner Earth (1974), screenwritten by his wife Barbara, it was shot in 1973 with the working title of The Selected. His next film project was The Giant Spider Invasion, starring Alan Hale Jr., Barbara Hale, and Steve Brodie. The film grossed $23 million against its $325,000 production costs. This was followed by Rana: The Legend of Shadow Lake (1981), The Alpha Incident (1978), The Capture of Bigfoot (1979), The Demons of Ludlow (1983) and The Game (1984). In 1984 Rebane took a break from production to assume the Presidency of The International Picture Show Company in Atlanta, where he took charge of international distribution for such products as Falling in Love Again (Elliott Gould), Slapstick (Jerry Lewis), Land of No Return (William Shatner), and many of the Don Knotts and Tim Conway comedy features. In 1986, Rebane returned to 'The Shooting Ranch' and hosted a 1950s nostalgia concert. Among the invitees were Forrest Tucker, Jaye P. Morgan, Bill Haley's Comets, and Tiny Tim. Rebane later cast Tiny Tim in Blood Harvest in the role of an insane clown, which was Tim's first and last starring role. Also in 1986, and due to Rebane's ongoing efforts extending from 1969, Wisconsin passed legislation establishing the Wisconsin Film Office. In 1987, Rebane released Blood Harvest, In 1988 he released Twister's Revenge!, and in 1989 Rebane suffered a stroke, which illness and the costs it incurred led to the closure of his studio. = Additional projects = In the mid-1990s, after recovery, Rebane and his wife moved to Watersmeet, Michigan where he wrote the book Film funding two-thousand, and in 1999 he moved to Hurley, Wisconsin, where he and his wife ran a hotel and a new film production company called 'Eagle's Nest Productions'. He has developed a variety of different projects, but has had no major releases since Blood Harvest. = Filmography =  Films  ;As director/producer *Monster a Go-Go (1965) *Invasion from Inner Earth (1974) *The Giant Spider Invasion (1975) *The Alpha Incident (1978) *The Capture of Bigfoot (1979) *Rana: The Legend of Shadow Lake (1981) *The Demons of Ludlow (1983) *The Game (1984) *Blood Harvest (1987) *Twister's Revenge!

Part VIPart VI of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 of PACE required the Home Secretary to issue Codes of Practice governing police powers. The aim of PACE is to establish a balance between the powers of the police in England and Wales and the rights and freedoms of the public. Equivalent provision is made for Northern Ireland by the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (SI 1989/1341). The equivalent in Scots Law is the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. Although PACE is a fairly wide-ranging piece of legislation, it mainly deals with police powers to search an individual or premises, including their powers to gain entry to those premises, the handling of exhibits seized from those searches, and the treatment of suspects once they are in custody, including being interviewed. Specific legislation as to more wide-ranging conduct of a criminal investigation is contained within the Criminal Procedures and Investigation Act 1996. Criminal liability may arise if the specific terms of the Act itself are not conformed to, whereas failure to conform to the codes of practice while searching, arresting, detaining or interviewing a suspect may lead to evidence obtained during the process becoming inadmissible in court. PACE also introduces various Codes of Practice, one of the most notable being an arrest without warrant can only be lawful if the necessity test contained within Code G of PACE is met. PACE was significantly modified by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. This replaced nearly all existing powers of arrest, including the category of arrestable offences, with a new general power of arrest for all offences. PACE is applicable not only to police officers but to anyone with conduct of a criminal investigation including Her Majesty's Revenue and CustomsPolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 114 and to military investigations, the Ministry of Defence Police.Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 113 Any person with a duty of investigating criminal offences or charging offenders is also required to follow the provisions of the PACE codes of practice as far as practical and relevant.Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 67(9). These include officers of the Serious Fraud Office (R v Director of the Serious Fraud Office, ex p. Saunders [1988] Crim LR 837), trading standards officers (Dudley MBC v Debenhams (1994) 159 JP 18), commercial investigators when interviewing an employee (Twaites and Brown (1990) 92 Cr App R 106), store detectives (Bayliss (1993) 98 Cr App R 235), Federation Against Copyright Theft investigators (Joy v Federation Against Copyright Theft [1993] Crim LR 588) and council officers. However such a duty is not owed by DTI inspectors appointed under sections 432 and 442 of the Companies Act 1985 (Seelig and Spens [1992] 1 WLR 148), nor by prison officers (Martin Taylor [2000] EWCA Crim 2922). Despite its safeguards, PACE was extremely controversial on its introduction, and reviews have also been controversial,Press Gazette: PACE review is 'wake-up' call as the Act was thought to give considerable extra powers to the police. With the conjunction of the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise into Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), HMRC essentially gained extra powers since Customs and Excise had a statutory right of entry into a private dwelling, that is to say they were allowed to break and enter without reason, but the Inland Revenue did not. PACE and its subsequent enactments limits that. Various other government agencies including TV Licensing, the Royal Mail, BT Group (from its days of being spun off from General Post Office Telephones) and about seventeen others also have a statutory right of entry. One intent of PACE and its successors is to prevent the abuse of this right, or remove it entirely, to balance the privacy of the individual against the needs of the State. Background The 1981 Brixton riots and the subsequent Scarman report were key factors in the passage of the Act. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 was brought in following recommendations set out by the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure. The purpose of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 was to unify police powers under one code of practice and to balance carefully the rights of the individual against the powers of the police. PACE Codes of Practice The Home Office and the Cabinet Office announced a joint review of PACE and its codes of practice in May 2002, and on 31 July 2004, new PACE Codes of Practice came into effect. Following a further review in 2010, PACE Codes A, B and D were re-issued to take effect on 7 March 2011. * PACE Code A: deals with the exercise by police officers of statutory powers to search a person or a vehicle without first making an arrest. It also deals with the need for a police officer to make a record of such a stop or encounter.Stop and Search under Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 On 1 January 2009, Code A was amended to remove lengthy stop and account recording procedures, requiring police to only record a subject's ethnicity and to issue them with a receipt.Home Office Circular 032 / 2008 ‚Äì Stop And Account: Amendment To Pace Code A, Home Office, 19 December 2008. * PACE Code B: deals with police powers to search premises and to seize and retain property found on premises and persons. * PACE Code C: sets out the requirements for the detention, treatment and questioning of people in police custody by police officers. It replaced the Judges' Rules in England and Wales. * PACE Code D: concerns the main methods used by the police to identify people in connection with the investigation of offences and the keeping of accurate and reliable criminal records. * PACE Code E: deals with the tape recording of interviews with suspects in the police station. * PACE Code F: deals with the visual recording with sound of interviews with suspects. On 1 January 2006 an additional code came into force: * PACE Code G: deals with statutory powers of arrest. On 24 July 2006 a further code came into force: * PACE Code H: deals with the detention of terrorism suspects. Case law In the case of Osman v Southwark Crown Court (1999),Osman v Southwark Crown Court the search of Osman was held to be unlawful because the officers searching him did not give their names and station, contrary to PACE's requirements.Martin, Jacqueline (2005). The English Legal System (4th ed.), p. 129. London: Hodder Arnold. . In O'Loughlin v Chief Constable of Essex (1997), the courts held that the entry of a premises under section 17 PACE to arrest O'Loughlin's wife for criminal damage was unlawful because under PACE, anyone present on the premises must be given the reason for entry.O'Loughlin v Chief Constable of Essex [1997] EWCA Civ 2891Martin, p. 133. However, not all cases have gone against the police; in R v Longman (1988), it was held that the police entry of a premises to execute a search warrant for drugs was lawful, although deception had been utilised to gain entry, and upon entering, the police had not identified themselves or shown the warrant.Martin, p. 132.

Alvin Plantinga argued that belief in God is a properly basic belief, and so no basis for belief in God is necessary.Origins.org Alvin Plantinga The best-known defender of this argument is Alvin Plantinga. According to the argument from a proper basis, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, Plantinga argues that belief in God is properly basic, and, owing to a religious externalist epistemology, he claims belief in God could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called \\"Proper functionalism\\", is a form of epistemological reliabilism. Compare \\"L'epistemologia riformata (Plantinga)\\", article on Philosophia Reformata.

In the second book of his three book philosophical series, Warrant and Proper Function, he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability. Alvin Plantinga, Warrant and Proper Function, New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. Plantinga's \\"proper function\\" account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one's \\"belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers\\" are functioning properly‚Äî\\"working the way it ought to work\\".WPF, p. 4 Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a \\"design plan\\", as well as an environment in which one's cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: \\"it is perhaps possible that evolution (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans\\",WPF, p. 21 but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological naturalism- i.e. epistemology that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties ‚Äì is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics ‚Äì in this case the belief in a creator God or in some designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.WPF, 237. According to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if: > (1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning > properly‚Ä¶; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one > for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) ‚Ä¶ the design plan > governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or > function, the production of true beliefs‚Ä¶; and (4) the design plan is a good > one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a > belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan > in that sort of environment is true.Plantinga, Warrant and Proper Function, > 1993. 194. Plantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as \\"naturalistic\\", including the \\"functional generalization\\" view of John Pollock, the evolutionary/etiological account provided by Ruth Millikan, and a dispositional view held by John Bigelow and Robert Pargetter.WPF, p. 199-211. Plantinga also discusses his evolutionary argument against naturalism in the later chapters of Warrant and Proper Function. In 2000 Plantinga's third volume, Warranted Christian Belief, was published. In this volume, Plantinga's warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the \\"A/C\\" (Aquinas/Calvin) model, and the \\"Extended A/C\\" model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that core Christian theological beliefs, including the Trinity, the Incarnation, the resurrection of Christ, the atonement, salvation, etc. can be warranted. Under this model, Christians are warranted in their beliefs because of the work of the Holy Spirit in bringing those beliefs about in the believer. Objections =The Great Pumpkin Objection= The best known objection to the argument from a proper basis is known as 'The Great Pumpkin Objection'. Alvin Plantinga brought it up in his 1983 book Warrant: The Current Debate, and described it as follows: > It is tempting to raise the following sort of question. If belief in God can > be properly basic, why cannot just any belief be properly basic? Could we > not say the same for any bizarre aberration we can think of? What about > voodoo or astrology? What about the belief that the Great Pumpkin returns > every Halloween? Could I properly take that as basic? Suppose I believe that > if I flap my arms with sufficient vigor, I can take off and fly about the > room; could I defend myself against the charge of irrationality by claiming > this belief is basic? If we say that belief in God is properly basic, will > we not be committed to holding that just anything, or nearly anything, can > properly be taken as basic, thus throwing wide the gates to irrationalism > and superstition? (p. 74) Rebuttal Plantinga's answer to this line of thinking is that the objection simply assumes that the criteria for \\"proper basicality\\" propounded by classical foundationalism (self-evidence, incorrigibility, and sense- perception) are the only possible criteria for properly basic beliefs. It is as if the Great Pumpkin objector feels that if properly basic beliefs cannot be arrived at by way of one of these criteria, then it follows that just 'any' belief could then be properly basic, precisely because there are no other criteria. But Plantinga says it simply doesn't follow from the rejection of classical foundationalist criteria that all possibility for criteria has been exhausted and this is exactly what the Great Pumpkin objection assumes. Plantinga takes his counter-argument further, asking how the great pumpkin objector \\"knows\\" that such criteria are the only criteria. The objector certainly seems to hold it as 'basic' that the classical foundationalist criteria are all that is available. Yet, such a claim is neither self-evident, incorrigible, nor evident to the senses. This rebuts the Great Pumpkin objection by demonstrating the classical foundationalist position to be internally incoherent, propounding an epistemic position which it itself does not follow.

Created by Brian Pulido, Lady Death first appeared in Evil Ernie #1 in December 1991. Lady Death then reappeared in the Evil Ernie: The Resurrection miniseries published by Pulido under his now-defunct company Chaos! Comics in 1994. The character was also the subject of a full-length animated feature film released in July 2004 by ADV Films. Incarnations of the character have been illustrated by such comic book artists as Steven Hughes, Mike Deodato, Jr., Romano Molenaar and Ivan Reis. Brian Pulido has optioned publishing licenses through various independent companies such as Avatar Press. , Lady Death was published by Pulido's Coffin Comics, LLC. In addition, Lady Death has been depicted in artworks by a number of well-known fantasy artists such as Dorian Cleavenger, Gerald Brom, Boris Vallejo, Joe Jusko and Julie Bell. Publication history Lady Death was originally published by Chaos Comics and remains one of the best examples of the bad girl titles that took the American comic book industry by storm during the late 1990s. The earliest issues of Lady Death were written by Brian Pulido and illustrated by Steven Hughes. Lady Death was originally conceived as a violent anti-hero, but subsequent iterations have toned down the more controversial aspects of the character. In August 2002, Chaos! Comics filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and the intellectual property rights to Lady Death were sold to CrossGen Entertainment. Pulido continued to work on Lady Death for Crossgen, creating a new series titled Medieval Lady Death that was released in February 2003. This version of Lady Death made substantial changes to the character in an attempt to capture a larger mainstream audience. Despite Medieval Lady Death enjoying reasonable sales, CrossGen Entertainment ran into financial difficulties of its own and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 18, 2004, in Tampa, Florida. During the bankruptcy proceedings, the rights to Lady Death were sold to Avatar Press. The other Chaos! Comics properties were sold to Tales of Wonder. In 2004, a feature-length animated motion picture based upon the original version of Lady Death was released.Lady Death Movie Information at IMDB Produced by ADV films, the Lady Death animated feature premiered at Comic-Con International in San Diego on July 23, 2004. The film was poorly received and was not a major financial success. In July 2005, Avatar Press unveiled a new version of Lady Death.Lady Death at Avatar Press Both Medieval Lady Death as well as the Classic Lady Death were published in separate series. Pulido wrote both series, which featured art by several Avatar Press artists, including Juan Jose Ryp, Daniel HDR, Richard Ortiz, Ron Adrian, Di Amorin and Gabriel Guzman. In April 2010, Avatar Press announced it would create a separate imprint, Boundless, to publish new comics starring the character later that year. Pulido and Mike Wolfer wrote the ongoing series. In 2015, Pulido launched new Lady Death stories via Kickstarter. In April 2016, Pulido began publishing new stories under his company Coffin Comics, LLC. Fictional character biography =The first Lady Death= Lady Death originated as a hallucination by a troubled boy named Ernest \\"Ernie\\" Fairchild. Ernie believed Lady Death was his dream girl: a violent, sexy supervillain. She promised to \\"love Ernie forever\\" in exchange for his loyalty and a vow to kill everyone on Earth. Initially, Lady Death's appearances in Ernie's stories were that of a muse and confidant. Eventually it is revealed that she is her own demonic entity. Her true intentions and her past remained a mystery. As Ernie's story progressed, Lady Death moved on and led her own. =Classic Lady Death= The setting for the original Lady Death comic was medieval Sweden. The woman who would become Lady Death was born a mortal named Hope. Her father was a local nobleman named Matthias who was forcibly conscripting peasants into military service as feudal levies. The exact nature of the war that Matthias was prosecuting is not specified, although evidence from the recent revision of the character by Avatar Press suggests that it may have been one of the Northern Crusades (also known as the Baltic Crusades). Unknown to his innocent daughter, Matthias had a dark secret. Although congratulated by the Church for his work against the pagans, he was despised by the common folk as a cruel tyrant. Matthias was outwardly pious, but secretly dabbled in black magic and demonology. He was actually a descendant of the fallen angels who had led the rebellion against God. By contrast, Hope's mother was a woman so pure and innocent that her bloodline reached Heaven. Hope's mother died when Hope was still in her late teens, and she was left to live with her father. Eventually, Matthias' cruelty triggered a peasant uprising. Matthias narrowly escaped death at the hands of the rebels by summoning a demon, but Hope was captured by the rebels and accused of witchcraft. Faced with the prospect of execution by burning at the stake, Hope uttered an incantation that she had overheard her father use. This incantation summoned a demon who offered her a bargain ‚Äì he would rescue her from death if she would renounce her humanity and serve the powers of Hell. Hope accepted the bargain and was transported into the infernal realms. Once in Hell, Hope became entangled in a civil war that was raging between Lucifer and an army of renegade devils led by a powerful sorcerer. Hope was devastated when she learned that the ambitious sorcerer challenging Lucifer for the control of Hell was her own father. Gradually corrupted by the nature of her surrounding, Hope was tainted with evil. She allied herself with an exiled craftsman who forged weapons for the infernal armies. While speaking to him, she declared that the innocent woman she had once been was dead and that she would henceforth only be known as Lady Death. In her new persona, Lady Death led an uprising against the Lords of Hell. During the final battle, Lucifer cursed her never to return to Earth while the living walked. Lady Death swore an oath that she would circumvent Lucifer's curse by exterminating all life on Earth. Lady Death finally ended Lucifer's control over her by casting him through Heaven's Gate (a place where evil cannot go), and in doing so became the new ruler of Hell. Many of the beings living in hell believe that the ascension of Lady Death signaled the beginning of the age of judgment ‚Äì the final battle between good and evil for the fate of the Earth. =Classic Lady Death at Avatar Press= Since 2005, Avatar Press has published Lady Death titles. Since they only have the rights to Lady Death alone (without the rest of the Chaos! Comics characters that were so intertwined with her original story), Lady Death has been given a new origin story, with notable differences to the story told at Chaos! Comics. Hope is the daughter of Mary and Marius. Marius is a crusader who has been waging endless campaigns against the pagans, always returning with only his most loyal soldiers, while the peasant levies were slaughtered. This angered the survivors. Hope, realising that her father has changed and is no longer the man he once was, follows him into the dungeons, with her mother close behind. The townsfolk meanwhile batter down the gates and invade the castle, intent on revenge. Hope discovers her father summoning dark wraiths, and sacrificing the souls of countless peasants in exchange for a kingdom in The Labyrinth. The wraiths refer to her father as Sagos. Sagos grabs hold of Mary, revealing that he has possessed Marius' body, and they disappear through the portal, leaving Hope behind. Cheated of their revenge, the villagers decide to burn Hope at the stake as a witch. Not wishing to die, Hope casts the spell she overheard her father cast, and summons the wraiths herself. The wraiths agree to transport her through the portal, if she forsakes her humanity and pledges her soul to The Labyrinth. Hope passes through the portal, her skin and hair turning albino in the process (the mark of all those who willingly choose to pass through the portal), and finds herself in the Blacklands. There she encounters Wargoth, who observes her uncontrolled and instinctive use of magic, and agrees to help her destroy Sagos and rescue her mother. He recruits the sorceress Satasha to teach Hope spellcraft. Wargoth also teaches her how to fight, but every weapon she wields melts in her hand due to her uncontrolled energy. Over the next two years, Lady Death and her companions fight through the Blacklands, hunting for Sagos. All the while Sagos' undead army destroys and converts the cities of the Blacklands. Eventually, Lady Death and her companions track Sagos down to a temple in Karrion, where they discover Sagos holding Lady Death's mother in chains. Sagos defeats them easily and brings the temple down around them. Lady Death digs herself out and is attacked by Nameless Wolves, slaying all but two of them. These two wolves become her companions. In the city of Asuwa, Lady Death recovers the sword Deathbringer, which was specially made for her by Satasha and The Silent One. Deathbringer is able to withstand her energies without being destroyed, and allows her to channel her magic through it. Lady Death then bathes in the Fanghorn river, which grants knowledge of elemental magic to those who survive the experience. She uses this power to save Satasha's home city from destruction, but learns that Sagos does not plan to just conquer the Blacklands, but to wipe out all life, and that he has the means to do it.

The movie begins in 15th century Sweden, where Hope, the beautiful daughter of Matthias, a skilled mercenary who is in actuality a demon, is accused of being the devil's consort. Sentenced by the town priest to be burned at the stake, Matthias, through his proxy, the jester Pagan, offers her life if she surrenders herself to him and joins him in Hell. Matthias's plan to corrupt her is met with unanticipated resistance, as Hope rejects his scheme and eventually finds herself transformed into the powerful warrior Lady Death, who challenges Lucifer for control of Hell itself. Many of the events from the comics are altered in the animated film. Instead of summoning a demon with whom she bargains for her life, Hope's spell summons a pair of flying demons that carry her physically to Hell (restoring her badly burned body in the process), dropping her in the court of her father, who intends for her to join him by his side. When she refuses, he casts her out, only for her to side with the master blacksmith Cremator, an escaped slave of his, and to lead an army of hellspawn creatures against him. In this continuity, her curse is to be trapped in Hell for as long as one of Lucifer's allies remains alive. Unlike in the comic, Lady Death is presented as more of a heroine whose goal isn't to destroy all life on earth, but to liberate Hell from Lucifer's tyranny.

The character was created by the writer, Tony Jordan. She was introduced as a school friend of Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) in January 1995. In 1996, after getting herself a job as barmaid of the soap's pub, The Queen Victoria, Tiffany started a relationship with the former pub landlord Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp). They married before the year was out. In 1997, Tiffany gave Grant a daughter called Courtney. Tiffany was a prominent and popular character during her tenure. McCutcheon quit the role at the end of 1998 in order to pursue a musical career. Producers made the decision to kill the character off, an act that McCutcheon publicly criticised as she had hoped to return at some stage. A book released in September 1998, documenting Tiffany's time in the soap, was a number-one bestseller. Storylines Tiffany is invited to a house party by her friend Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) in Albert Square. She rejects Bianca's younger brother Robbie Jackson's (Dean Gaffney) romantic advances. After finding work as a barmaid at The Queen Victoria public house, Tiffany moves to Walford. She clashes with landlord Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), and one night their disagreement leads to passion. A few months later, she reveals to Grant her father caused her to miscarry, he comforts her and they have sex again. When sober, they both agree not to repeat this and Tiffany begins dating Tony Hills (Mark Homer). They move in together and the relationship blossoms until Tiffany discovers she is pregnant. Although she knows there is a possibility her child is Grant's, she decides to claim her baby is Tony's. It is not until Tiffany discovers Tony kissing her brother, Simon Raymond (Andrew Lynford), that she realises Tony is bisexual and has been having an affair with her brother. Devastated, Tiffany tells Grant he is her baby's father. Determined to raise the child, Grant whisks Tiffany away to Paris in November 1996 for a quick wedding. Tony refuses to believe Grant is the father and subsequent fights ensue, with Tiffany staunchly denying Tony has claim to her unborn baby. Living with Grant proves difficult for Tiffany. Grant refuses to allow Tiffany to socialise or drink alcohol, fearing that it may harm his unborn child. After Grant witnesses Tiffany having a cocktail, he is incensed. Tiffany threatens to leave him and Grant almost attacks her but is stopped by Lorraine Wicks (Jacqueline Leonard). Lorraine consoles a distraught Tiffany, who breaks down and admits that Grant may not be her baby's father. Lorraine tries to convince Tiffany to tell Grant the truth, but Tiffany decides against it and continues to keep up the pretence. Meanwhile, Lorraine begins to make her real intentions towards Grant clear. On Christmas Eve 1996 she and Grant kiss and on New Year's Eve, Lorraine informs Grant there is a possibility Tiffany's baby is not his. Grant reacts by throwing a pregnant Tiffany out. Their separation allows Grant to embark on a relationship with Lorraine, destroying Tiffany. Tiffany gives birth to baby Courtney by caesarean section in March 1997, and for a moment Grant softens towards his wife. However it does not last and he is soon denouncing that the child is his. Tiffany is forced to get a paternity test, which reveals Grant is Courtney's father. Tiffany is allowed to stay at The Queen Vic so Grant can keep his daughter close. Still in love with Grant, Tiffany begs Grant to rethink their separation; he initially responds by threatening to sue her for sole custody of Courtney but changes his mind following Lorraine's departure from Walford. Not long after their reconciliation in August 1997, Grant and Tiffany renew their wedding vows and bond on a romantic trip to Paris. However, by 1998 he and Tiffany are rowing again. During a heated argument, Grant hits his mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), who is trying to stop Grant's violent outburst on Tiffany. Following this Tiffany moves out of the Mitchell residence and in with her mother, Louise Raymond (Carol Harrison). Grant attempts a reconciliation with Tiffany, but she decides she wants a divorce. She grows close to police officer Beppe di Marco (Michael Greco), who has fallen for Tiffany and despises Grant for his treatment of her. Grant decides to counter their relationship by making a pass at Tiffany's mother, Louise; they sleep together. Their affair abruptly ends when Tiffany reconsiders divorcing Grant. She and Grant reunite, but months later a distraught Tiffany overhears them talking about their affair over a baby monitor. Unbeknown to Louise or Grant, Tiffany starts packing to leave Walford. She confronts Grant, telling him that she is taking Courtney and he would never see her again. She attempts to leave but in her haste she accidentally falls down the stairs and is hospitalised with a blood clot on the brain and lapses into a coma. Everyone assumes Grant pushed her and when Tiffany wakes up and is released from hospital she is quickly prompted and persuaded by Beppe to lie to police and say that Grant pushed her. This then culminates in Grant being arrested for attempted murder on Christmas Day 1998. On New Year's Eve 1998, Tiffany makes plans to leave Walford with Courtney for Spain. While Courtney is left at The Queen Vic with Peggy, Tiffany takes it upon herself to tie up her various loose ends, firstly by disowning her mother Louise and breaking up with Beppe, whom she has never really had any true feelings for. Tiffany changes her mind about framing Grant and writes a signed confession exonerating him of any wrongdoing in her fall down the stairs. She then instructs Bianca to give it to the police after she has departed following an emotional goodbye. Unbeknownst to Tiffany, however, Grant has already been released from prison on bail. He returns to The Queen Vic, moments before Tiffany herself returns to claim Courtney. Having been told by Tiffany only hours earlier that she is planning to leave the country, Grant snatches Courtney and flees. Hysterical and frightened, Tiffany pursues them, which results in her running straight into an oncoming car, driven by Frank Butcher (Mike Reid). A helpless crowd watch as she dies at the scene. Tiffany is cremated and her ashes are scattered at Peacehaven. Four years after Tiffany's death, Bianca names her daughter Tiffany Butcher (Maisie Smith) - after her best friend. Creation and development =Introduction= Introduced in 1995 by series producer Barbara Emile, Tiffany Raymond was conceptualised by EastEnders' scriptwriter Tony Jordan as a school friend of already established character Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). Actress Martine McCutcheon was cast in the role. McCutcheon has revealed that she was initially hesitant about auditioning for the part, commenting to The Guardian, \\"An agent called me and said there was a part on EastEnders and I said, very offhandedly, 'I don't really want to do soap, because I want to do movies, and nobody I know goes from soap to movies, and it's just not the sort of actress I want to be [...] this agent said to me, just let me send you a synopsis of the character and see what you think, and I thought she was fantastic. And I watched EastEnders that night and I realised just how many people talked about it. So I told my agent, 'All right, I'm going to go for it, I'm not in a position to be fussy\\".\\"It's got to be perfect\\", The Guardian. URL last accessed on 2007-01-13. =Casting= In Larry Jaffee's book, Albert Square & Me: The Actors of Eastenders, McCutcheon discussed the auditioning process at the BBC in December 1994, saying that the casting directors liked the way she read, but did not feel that her dress sense tallied with their vision of Tiffany. They asked her to return in a few days dressed like their vision, in \\"flashy clothes and junk jewelry\\" and showing a \\"bit of cleavage\\". McCutcheon attended \\"gangster clubs\\" to research the type of clothing worn by women that frequented them. She returned to the BBC wearing fishnet stockings, a tight lycra skirt, junk jewelry, orange lipstick and fake tan. She was told that her look was \\"perfect\\" and several days later she was informed that she had been given the role. McCutcheon's final competitor for the role of Tiffany was actress Claire Goose, who later appeared in EastEnders in a minor role as a hairdresser before achieving fame in the BBC drama series Casualty. =Characterisation= Tiffany has been described as a \\"tart with a heart\\".\\"Martine McCutcheon\\", Sky.com. URL last accessed on 2007-01-13. According to McCutcheon, Tiffany's original character outline, as described by the casting directors, portrayed her as a \\"feisty and quite bitchy character, quite worldly.\\" McCutcheon has claimed that she partly based her portrayal of Tiffany on her own mother, Jenny; her mother gave her advice on how to play the character. McCutcheon claims her mother told her \\"to wear the dangly earrings with the short skirts and the low, V-neck tops, because that's what the barmaids wore. She was very open about it all. She'd say you need to lean over and say in a breathy but firm voice, 'Hello! What d'you fancy?' And, hopefully, they'll say, 'You', and you'll get free drinks all night.\\" McCutcheon has described Tiffany as \\"fun and sassy\\". She added, \\"She has also got a lot of her morals wrong and she's a bit back to front. But she means well!\\" =Relationship with Grant Mitchell= A volatile relationship between Tiffany and her boss, landlord Grant Mitchell, was scripted in the show. It began with a one-night stand on-screen, which led to \\"a sizzling undercurrent between them\\". McCutcheon felt in 1996 that there was a lot of chemistry between Grant and Tiffany and was keen for the characters to have a legitimate relationship. However, plots went on to pair Tiffany with another character, the sexually confused Tony Hills (Mark Homer). In the storyline, Tony struggles with his homosexuality and, fearful of these urges, begins a relationship with Tiffany. This facilitates several plot twists, when Tiffany discovers she is pregnant she is uncertain as to whether the baby is Tony's or Grant's, and simultaneously, Tony begins an affair with Tiffany's brother Simon Raymond (Andrew Lynford). When Tony and Simon's affair is uncovered, Tiffany reunites with Grant after telling him her baby is his and they elope off-screen. Depicted as a problematic marriage, according to a show insider in 1996, \\"The marriage runs into trouble before the ink has even dried on the wedding certificate\\". In the storyline Grant falls for another barmaid, Lorraine Wicks (Jacqueline Leonard), and the Mitchell partnership ends in separation the same year when Grant is informed that Tiffany's baby might not be his. Later, Grant begrudgingly reunites with Tiffany in 1997 when he is confirmed as the father, but attempts to brand Tiffany as an incompetent mother. The Mitchell baby saga was a ratings success for EastEnders. Commenting on the storyline and her character, McCutcheon said in 1997, \\"Tiffany will be really upset that Grant is trying to make out she's not a good mother. It's so unjust, she adores [her daughter] Courtney. She's changed completely since the birth. She used to be hard and selfish, only interested in men and clothes, being free and having a wild time. Now all she wants is to settle down. Grant can't complain if he feels his daughter isn't being looked after properly. He hasn't given Tiff the support she needs.\\" Tiffany's determination for the marriage to succeed despite upset was a repetitive theme and in 1997, McCutcheon discussed Tiffany's motivation and development as Tiffany and Grant prepared to have the marriage blessed in a more formal ceremony aired on-screen: \\"Tiffany sees [her marriage to Grant] as her last chance to grab some happiness. She never wants to suffer again the way she did. The pair of them gave their all in an effort to try to make it work. So delighted to have Grant back that this should be the best day of her life.\\" McCutcheon claims that this spelt a new phase for Tiffany's character as she made a determined effort to win Grant back but under her own terms: \\"Now Tiffany is much more assertive. She loves Grant, but this time round she will never allow him to rule her life. Grant has to remember that now she sees it as equally important to be a mother as well as a wife. Having her daughter Courtney, she knows she will never be alone and does not need to follow meekly in Grant's shadow.\\" McCutcheon added, \\"[Tiffany]'s changed completely since the birth [of her daughter]. She used to be hard and selfish, only interested in men and clothes, being free and having a wild time. Now all she wants is to settle down.\\" =Departure controversy= In September 1997, it was leaked to the press that McCutcheon was considering leaving EastEnders in order to pursue a singing career. Rumours about her exit continued throughout early 1998, with sources suggesting that McCutcheon was hoping to remain on EastEnders while also releasing music. In an interview with website Walford Web, Matthew Robinson, the executive producer at the time, gave his account of what happened. He stated that McCutcheon demanded that \\"the BBC allow her to come and go within the series at her behest, making it impossible for storyliners to write coherently for her character.\\" Because of this, the show's bosses made the decision to kill the character of Tiffany off. McCutcheon was displeased with this and went public with her criticism of the decision, stating that she was not informed by the producers but heard the news on the radio after a tabloid newspaper ran a front-page story with the headline \\"Tiff's a stiff\\". Robinson suggested that this was due to an unsanctioned leak to the press. On-screen, Tiffany's exit storyline centred upon another break-up with husband Grant after she discovered that he had slept with her mother Louise (Carol Harrison). Leading up to her final scenes in December 1998, Tiffany and Grant were involved in a row that left Tiffany hospitalised after falling down the stairs; Tiffany attempted to frame Grant for pushing her. 20 million viewers watched the episode. Matthew Robinson said he was delighted by the figures, saying they showed \\"our stories just get better and better. It's a great tribute to EastEnders' storyliners, writers and cast, particularly Martine McCutcheon as Tiffany.\\" Viewing figures remained high throughout the Christmas 1998 week as the storyline climaxed in Tiffany's exit on the New Year's episode, when Tiffany was killed after being hit by a car while trying to retrieve Courtney from Grant. Her exit was watched by over 12 million viewers. McCutcheon publicly slammed the BBC's \\"Controller of Continuing Drama Series\\", Mal Young, who was one of the executives who made the decision to kill her character. She accused him of treating her unfairly and bringing her role in the soap to an end so irrevocably, merely as punishment for leaving. In turn, Young has hit back at McCutcheon, saying her anger only arose because she wanted him to keep her role in EastEnders open as a 'safety net', in case her pop career failed, and he was not prepared to do this. McCutcheon subsequently wrote an autobiography entitled Who Does She Think She Is?: My Autobiography, which depicts Young less than favourably. Robinson defended the decision to kill the character, telling Walford Web, \\"Far from hasty, the decision was carefully made, not just by me, but by the trio of Mal Young, Peter Salmon (BBC1 Controller) and me. We knew exactly what we were doing and it was exactly right for the show at the time, whatever Martine continues to say about it. Sometimes, actors want to have their cake and eat it. This is not possible in a streamlined production factory, like EastEnders.\\" McCutcheon commented, \\"I wanted to be written out but not in such a final way. I was very upset. Even if I become the most successful singer in the world, I would still have loved it if I could have walked back into the Queen Vic.\\" In a subsequent interview she added: Reception BBC executive Mal Young has suggested that Tiffany was an iconic character, akin to original characters Den Watts and Angie Watts (Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson). McCutcheon has suggested that Tiffany was universally liked by men and women, \\"was the kind of allowable fantasy, fancied by men, admired by women, that enabled all viewers to love her\\". McCutcheon claims that she received much fanmail whilst in the role, with offers of marriage proposals. She claims that young girls idolised Tiffany. McCutcheon's performance as Tiffany saw her win 'Most Popular Actress' at the 1997 National Television Awards, and 'Best Actress' at the 1998 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards. Tiffany was voted Britain's sexiest soap star in 1997. In the book, Monarchies: What Are Kings and Queens For?, the authors relate Tiffany's death in EastEnders to the real death of Princess Diana - a senseless death of a beautiful young woman. The authors suggest that Tiffany's death was one of the most powerful and popular stories featured in EastEnders. They suggest that like Diana, Tiffany was \\"A beautiful, flawed and misunderstood woman, she died in tragic circumstances while escaping a pursuer who wanted to possess her.\\" Tiffany's death has been described as event television in the book Television at the crossroads, meaning a programme that causes audiences to break their viewing habits for an evening and all migrate to the same channel at the same time. Grant and Tiffany's volatile relationship made headlines in July 1997 amid reports that EastEnders' bosses were considering airing a controversial storyline that would see Tiffany raped by Grant. The plot, which was slated to be aired on Christmas Day 1997, evoked criticism from female MPs and children's groups, TV clean-up campaigners and church officials, who were all expressive in unanimous condemnation about the BBC's \\"cynical ploy to win the seasonal ratings war over arch-rival Coronation Street.\\" Labour MP Ann Clwyd suggested that the BBC should \\"reconsider\\" and Michelle Elliott, director of the children's charity Kidscape, said: \\"This is an appalling, outrageous, utterly nauseous example of rape for ratings.\\" Reports also alleged that Grant's actor Ross Kemp was not happy about the plot either and threatened to quit the role unless the scripts were altered. Subsequently, the plot never came to fruition.\\"EastEnder hardman Ross says he'll quit over Christmas Day rape plot\\", Sunday Mirror. URL last accessed on 2007-02-24. In other media In December 1998, to coincide with the character's death, a fictional book penned by Kate Lock entitled Tiffany's Secret Diary was released. The diary documented Tiffany's time in the soap, beginning when she discovered her pregnancy and covering several years of her life until Christmas 1998. The book was a number one bestseller.

Peter Heather notes that Agila's reign was during a period of civil war following the death of Amalaric, the last member of the old Visigothic dynasty, when ambitious Gothic nobles competed openly for the throne.Peter Heather, The Goths (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), pp. 278f Agila came to power after the assassination of Theudigisel, who had ruled for less than two years. However, opposition to his rule soon emerged. First was the revolt of the city of C√≥rdoba, which Isidore of Seville suggests was due to local Roman Catholics objecting to his Arianism: in his account, Isidore mentions that Agila defiled the church of a local saint, Acisclus, by drenching the sepulcher \\"with the blood of the enemy and of their pack-animals\\", and attributes the death of Agila's son in the conflict ‚Äî along with the majority of his army, and the royal treasury ‚Äî to \\"the agency of the saints\\".Isidore of Seville, History of the Goths, chapter 47. Translation by Guido Donini and Gordon B. Ford, Isidore of Seville's History of the Goths, Vandals, and Suevi, second revised edition (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1970), pp. 21f. Heather dates the beginning of this conflict to 550 (The Goths, p. 278) Peter Heather lists several groups who revolted against Agila: a local dynast, Aspidius, established a hegemony in one mountainous region; the landowners of Cantabria established a \\"senate\\" to govern their affairs; and then there are the Sappi and Suani mentioned by John of Biclar.Heather, The Goths, p. 278 The most important rebel opposed to Agila was Athanagild, whose open revolt began in 551, following Agila's defeat at Cordoba. The armies of Agila and Athanagild met at Seville, where Agila met a second defeat.Isidore of Seville, chapter 46; translation by Donini and Ford, p. 22 At this point, a third party entered the war between these two: the Byzantine Empire. As Peter Heather writes, \\"One of the two ‚Äî which is the subject of varying report ‚Äî summoned a Byzantine army, which duly arrived in southern Spain in 552.\\" Heather understands Isidore's chronicle states that Athanagild summoned the Byzantines, while Jordanes implies in his Getica that Agila had asked them for help. During this three-sided conflict King Agila was killed ‚Äî according to Isidore by his own people, who realized the destruction Agila's wars to retain power had caused, but \\"fearing even more that Roman soldiers might invade Spain on the pretext of giving help\\".Isidore of Seville, chapter 47; translation by Donini and Ford, p. 22 Athanagild was then accepted as king.

He was the only Mayflower passenger with prior New World experience, having been shipwrecked in Bermuda in 1609 and arriving at Jamestown, Virginia in May 1610. Hopkins left Jamestown in 1614 and returned to England. English origins Hopkins was baptized 30 April 1581 at Upper Clatford, Hampshire, England, the son of John Hopkins and Elizabeth Williams.Ernest M.

His father died there in 1593, and by 1604 he had moved to Hursley, Hampshire. Early adventures in the New World Recent scholarship believes that this is the same Stephen Hopkins who was the only Mayflower passenger who had previously been to the New World, and that Hopkins had adventures that included surviving a shipwreck in Bermuda (\\"Isle of Devils\\") and working from 1610‚Äì14 in Jamestown.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers (New York: Grafton Press, 1929)National Park Service, \\"Historic Jamestown: Stephen Hopkins\\" In early 1609 Stephen Hopkins began employment as a minister's clerk, reading religious works to a congregation including members of the Virginia Company. On 2 June 1609 Hopkins left his wife and family, and in his ministerial clerk's position departed for Jamestown in Virginia on the 300-ton Sea Venture, flagship of a flotilla led by Sir George Somers. The Sea Venture was carrying the new Jamestown governor, Sir Thomas Gates, to his post, as well as resupplying the colony with goods and new settlers. After almost two months into the voyage, a severe storm separated the ships of the flotilla on 24 July 1609, and by evening the storm began raging worse and lasted for five days. Just when the Sea Venture was about to sink from storm damage, \\"land\\" was called out, with that being the island of Bermuda. The ship was forced to run itself aground about a mile offshore to keep from sinking. The castaways soon found that Bermuda was a Paradise, with plentiful water and food. On 1 September 1609, a month after the shipwreck and after they had built up their ship's longboat for an ocean voyage, they sent eight men out to try to reach Jamestown to get help, but they never returned. In late November 1609, they commenced construction of boats enough to take everyone off the island. By January 1610, even though Stephen Hopkins had remained with Governor Gates's group, he started voicing dissatisfaction with the governance of Thomas Gates and questioning his authority. Hopkins was arrested and charged with mutiny and was found guilty, for which the sentence was death. Many persons begged mercy for him, and he obtained a pardon. Hopkins ceased voicing controversial issues. The English in Jamestown and those later in Plymouth Colony were the antithesis of each other ‚Äî with those in Virginia composed of titled leaders who were in charge of often inexperienced settlers as well as soldiers who were veterans of European wars, such as Capt. John Smith. All at Jamestown were focused on returning a profit to their London investors, and under great stress when no gold, minerals or anything else of much value to London was found in the Chesapeake area. The colonists could not or would not farm, tried to barter for food with the natives and later stole food from them, leading to much violence, which continued for years.Tee Loftin Snell, The Wild Shores: America's Beginnings. National Geographic Society. (c. 1973 NGS) Ch. 4, pp. 83‚Äì85 On 10 May 1610, the two newly constructed boats departed Bermuda with all on board and arrived at Jamestown eleven days later. What they found there was that the colonists in Jamestown were starving to death due to their inability and in some cases unwillingness to produce food. They were afraid to go outside their fort, so were tearing down their houses for firewood. They were not planting crops, nor trading with the natives or catching fish. Much of this had to do with some settlers feeling it was beneath their dignity to work and the violent abuse they gave the native people, which caused much enmity towards the English. At his arrival from Bermuda, Governor Gates estimated there was only days worth of food left, and decided to voyage to Newfoundland and from there find a ship heading for England. Just as they were preparing to depart, an English ship came into the harbor with supplies and new settlers, along with a new governor, Lord de la Warr. The colonists were forced to return and reestablish their fort, albeit reluctantly. Back in England A report of the wreck of the Sea Venture and later events reached England. Most scholars believe that William Shakespeare based his play The Tempest on the report.Vaughan, Virginia Mason; Vaughan, Alden T. (1999). The Tempest. The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series, p.287. It was first performed in November 1611. The play depicts the experiences of a group of passengers being shipwrecked by a mighty storm. A subplot involves a comic character called Stephano, who tries to take over as leader on the island. It is possible that Stephano is based on Stephen Hopkins. While he was away, Stephen's wife Mary had survived by being a shopkeeper as well as receiving some of Stephen's wages. But she unexpectedly died in May 1613, leaving her three young children all alone. By 1614, a letter arrived for a \\"Hopkins\\" in Jamestown, and it is presumed that this is how he learned of her death, as he did return to England soon afterward to care for his children. He then took up residence in London, and there married his second wife Elizabeth Fisher. Although he had been through all manner of hardships and trials in the New World, including shipwreck, being sentenced to death with a last-minute pardon, and traveling to the Jamestown colony where he labored for several years, when he learned of the planned Mayflower voyage to northern Virginia to establish a colony, he signed on to go to America along with his family. The Mayflower voyage Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620, a painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris 1899 Stephen Hopkins and his family, consisting of his wife Elizabeth and his children Constance, Giles and Damaris, as well as two servants, departed Plymouth, England, on the Mayflower on 6/16 September 1620. The small, ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30‚Äì40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken, with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, is attributed as what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Allison Lassieur & Peter McDonnall, The Voyage of the Mayflower. Mankato, Minnesota: Capstone Press (2006) On 9 November 1620 (O.S) (19 November 1620 (N.S.)), after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to sail south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on 11/21 November. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691. Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing (1986) In Plymouth Colony Hopkins was a member of the early Mayflower exploratory parties while the ship was anchored in the Cape Cod area. He was well-versed in the hunting techniques and general lifestyle of American Indians from his years in Jamestown, which was later found to be quite useful to the Pilgrim leadership. The first formal meeting with the natives was held at Hopkins' house, and he was called upon to participate in early Pilgrim visits with the natives' leader Massasoit. Over the years Hopkins' assistance to Pilgrim leaders such as Myles Standish and Edward Winslow regarding his knowledge of the local languages was found to be quite useful. =Hopkins Plymouth Tavern= The Mayflower Quarterly of December 2011, in an article on Plymouth-area taverns, has a paragraph on Stephen Hopkins, who kept an \\"ordinary\\" (tavern) in Plymouth on the north side of Leyden Street from the earliest days of the colony.Stephen C. O'Neill, \\"Suitably Provided and Accommodated: Plymouth Area Taverns\\". The Mayflower Quarterly (Plymouth, MA: The General Society of Mayflower Descendants), December 2011, vol. 77, no. 4, pp. 335, 336 The article defines a 17th-century \\"ordinary\\" as a term for a tavern where set mealtimes and prices were offered. Terms such as \\"inn\\", \\"alehouse\\" and \\"tavern\\" were used interchangeably with \\"ordinary\\" in early Plymouth records. Hopkins kept this tavern from the early colony days until his death in 1644. In the early 1600s he had also had an alehouse in Hampshire with his wife Mary and his mother-in-law Joan, which they maintained after he left for America in 1609. Hopkins apparently had problems with the Court over his tavern. Plymouth records indicate that Hopkins let \\"men drink in his house upon the Lords day\\", \\"for suffering servants and others to sit drinking in his house\\" (contrary to Court orders), also to play games \\"& such like misdemeanors, is therefore fined shillings.\\" In addition, the Court had several charges against him \\"for selling wine, beere, strong waters, and nutmeggs at excessiue rates, is fyned.\\" Family The following is based on the extensive research of author Simon Neal: Stephen Hopkins' spouses: *Mary Kent is believed to be the first wife of Stephen Hopkins, born in Ratlake, Hampshire, in about 1580, the daughter of Robert and Joan Kent. Robert's father may have been named Andrew Kent. Joan's maiden name was probably Machill, or a variation thereof such as Machell, based on documents of the time. Research indicates Joan's parents' names were sometimes given as Robert and Joan Machell and that she (Joan the younger) had a brother Giles and sister Elizabeth. Giles and Elizabeth also appear as the names of two of Mary's children.Simon Neal, \\"Investigation into the origins of Mary and Elizabeth, the wives of Stephen Hopkins\\". The Mayflower Quarterly (Plymouth, MA: The General Society of Mayflower Descendants), June 2012, vol. 78, No. 2 p. 122Simon Neal, \\"Appendix - Investigation into the origins of Mary and Elizabeth, the wives of Stephen Hopkins\\". The Mayflower Quarterly (Plymouth, MA: The General Society of Mayflower Descendants), March 2013, vol. 79, no. 1 :Per Neal, the Machell and Kent families may have been able to trace their ancestries back to ancient times when they first appeared at the manor (then castle) of Merdon in Hursley parish, which could have been as early as the 13th century. :On 20 November 1558, per the bequests of the will of Thomas Backe of the parish of Hursley, Robert Machyll (Machill) is cited as being an Overseer, Witness and one of those who had taken his estate inventory on 2 December 1558. Robert Machill was the father of Joan Kent and grandfather of Mary Kent, wife of Stephen Hopkins. :Robert Machell, father of Joan Kent, appears in court records for the manor of Merdon, Hursley, Hants., on 26 October 1559. :On 28 April 1560 Robert Machyll (Machill) is recorded in the Hampshire Record Office as being involved, with two others, in the estate inventory of Margaret Backe, late the wife of Andrew Backe of the parish of Hursley. :The will of Robert Machell of Hursley, Hants., per the Hampshire Record Office. Will date: 24 January 1575, proved 25 April 1575. Persons mentioned in the will were Joan (wife), Giles (son), and Elizabeth and Joan (the younger) (daughters). Joan (the younger) would later be the mother of Mary Kent. :Documents for the 1588 rental of the manor of Merdon at Hursley, Hants. lists Robert Kent, father of Mary Kent, renting at Ratlake for 5s a sum total of consisting of house, orchard, garden yard, etc. :Mary's father, Robert Kent, died when she was young, leaving her mother Joan a widow. Mary's ancestry is difficult to research, but author Simon Neal determined that she had originally come from the Hursley area. No marriage record has been found for Mary and Stephen who had three children together between probably 1603 and 1608 ‚Äì Elizabeth, the eldest, Constance, and Giles. The baptism records for the three children have been located in the parish registers of Hursley, Hampshire. It is known that after their marriage around 1602 or before, Mary and Stephen resided with her mother Joan where they ran a small alehouse. Stephen departed for America in 1609, with his children being left in the care of his wife Mary and her mother Joan. In 1620 Stephen, his second wife Elizabeth and children Giles and Constance were Mayflower passengers. :Manorial court documents relating to the manor of Merdon list the following court date and charge: 3 Sept. 3 James I (1605): Alehouse keepers ‚Äì Joan Kent (and two others named) are charged with being common tipplers and have broken the assize of bread and ale. Therefore each of them is in mercy (fined) 4 pence. Joan Kent was the mother of Mary Kent, wife of Stephen Hopkins. :Joan Machill's brother Giles was named in the manorial court for the manor of Merdon, Hursley, Hampshire, for a minor offense with a date of 3 October 1611. At the time Giles Machill was recorded as innkeeper of the Star and his sister Joan Kent was the alehouse keeper. :In 1611 Joan died at about age 50, leaving the three Hopkins children in Mary's care. Mary died in 1613, at about age 33, with her burial entry appearing in parish registers on 9 May 1613 where she is described as the wife of Stephen Hopkins. Her inventory and administration were held on 12 May 1613 where it was noted she was the mother of Elizabeth, Giles and Constance and that she was a widow although at the time Stephen Hopkins was very much alive in Virginia. This may have been an error since apparently some monies from his employment at Jamestown did reach his wife and she may have known he was alive. In 1614 Hopkins received a letter at Jamestown informing him of his wife's death and shortly thereafter came back to England to care for his orphaned children. :Per author Neal, the Kent family continued its line through Giles Kent, Mary's probable brother, and continued to flourish in Hursley throughout the 17th century. *Stephen Hopkins came on the Mayflower with Elizabeth Hopkins, possibly his second wife, although her situation is not clear and she may have been Hopkins' third or even fourth wife. His children Giles and Constance, are referred to by Bradford as being children of a former wife, who may have been Hopkins' first wife, although this also is not clear. This wife was also probably the mother of an older daughter Elizabeth who may have been deceased prior to the Mayflower departure. Author Simon Neal, in a June 2012 Mayflower Quarterly article on this family, for purposes of convenience, assumes Elizabeth to be Hopkins' second wife and the mother of Giles and Constance to be children of the unknown first wife. The identity of his wife Elizabeth is unknown, although there is a marriage record in the parish registers of St. Mary Whitechapel in London for a Stephen Hopkins to Elizabeth Fisher on 19 February 1617/18, and it has been commonly established that this is the second marriage of Mayflower passenger Stephen Hopkins. Although it cannot be particularly assumed that this was Hopkins' second marriage, it does fit into the time period. Although there is no evidence found to date of what happened to the Stephen Hopkins and Elizabeth Fisher who married at St. Mary Whitechapel, author Simon Neal assumes that they were the Mayflower couple for the purposes of his research on this family. A search by Neal of baptisms in St. Mary Whitechapel in the second half of the 16th century reveals an Elizabeth Fisher who was baptized on 3 March 1582, but her father is not named and it is almost impossible to find out anything about her family. This Elizabeth would have been about age 35 when she married Stephen Hopkins and would have been close to his age, as he was thought to have been born about 1581. :Neal concludes that it is not possible to trace the origins of the Elizabeth Fisher who married Stephen Hopkins in the parish of St. Mary Whitechapel. She could have been from that parish or somewhere nearby in London or Stepney and of the Fisher family of Great Coates in North-east Lincolnshire. Neal emphasizes that there is no conclusive evidence that this is the same couple who embarked on the Mayflower but is assumed by most genealogists to be so. Elizabeth had already died when her husband Stephen wrote his will on 6 June 1644, as in it he asks to be buried next to his deceased wife Elizabeth. Children of Stephen Hopkins and his wife Mary, baptized in the parish of Hursley, co. Hampshire, England: *Elizabeth Hopkins was baptized on 13 March 1603/04. She was alive at her mother's death in 1613, but nothing else is known of her. As she did not board the Mayflower with her family, it is assumed she may have been married or deceased. Author Caleb Johnson believes she had died prior to the Mayflower sailing. This theory is given credence by the fact that Hopkins and his second wife Elizabeth also had a daughter named Elizabeth, born about 1632. *Constance Hopkins was baptized on 11 May 1606 and died in Eastham, Plymouth Colony, in mid-October 1677. She was a Mayflower passenger in 1620. By 22 May 1627 she had married Nicholas Snow in Plymouth and had twelve children. Her husband was a passenger on the ship Anne in 1623 and died on 15 November 1676. Both Constance and Nicholas were probably buried in Cove Burying Ground, Eastham, where memorial plaques for each were placed in 1966 by descendants.The Mayflower Quarterly, September 2010, (Plymouth, MA: The General Society of Mayflower Descendants), vol. 76, no. 3 *Giles Hopkins was baptized on 30 January 1607/08 and died in Eastham between 5 March 1688/9 and 16 April 1690. He was buried in Cove Burying Ground, Eastham. He was a Mayflower passenger in 1620. On 9 October 1639 he married Catherine Wheldon in Plymouth. Shortly thereafter they moved to Yarmouth, living there for about five years before moving to Eastham. They had ten children. Catherine was listed in his will (as \\"Catorne\\") but likely died sometime shortly after him.American Ancestors, Pilgrim Family Sketches Children of Stephen and Elizabeth Hopkins:A genealogical profile of Stephen Hopkins (a collaboration of Plimoth Plantation and New England Historic Genealogical Society, accessed 2013) * Damaris (1) was born about 1618 in England and died young in Plymouth.

He became a seaman and died at Barbados between 1644 and 1651. * Deborah was born in Plymouth about 1626 and died probably before 1674. She married Andrew Ring at Plymouth on 23 April 1646 and had six children. * Damaris (2) was born in Plymouth about 1627-8 and died in Plymouth between January 1665/6 and 18 November 1669.

She was unmarried. * Elizabeth was born in Plymouth about 1632 and probably died before 6 October 1659. She was unmarried. Will and death Stephen Hopkins died sometime between 6 June 1644, and 17 July of that year. He made his will on 6 June 1644, and requested that he be buried next to his deceased wife, Elizabeth. The inventory was taken on 17 July 1644, and mentions his deceased wife; his sons Giles and Caleb; his daughters Constance, Deborah, Damaris, Ruth and Elizabeth. The burial place of Stephen Hopkins is unknown.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/198080237/stephen- hopkins Servants on the Mayflower with the Hopkins family *Edward Doty. Servant, aged likely between 21 and 25. He signed the Mayflower Compact, with his name spelled as \\"Doten\\". He had a long, controversial life in Plymouth Colony, dying about 1655. *Edward Leister. As reported by William Bradford, he came on the Mayflower as a servant to Stephen Hopkins. He signed the Mayflower Compact, where his name was spelled as \\"Liester\\". He may have been in his early twenties and possibly came from the area of London where the Hopkins family resided before boarding the Mayflower. The Plymouth division of cattle in 1627 does not list him, and he may have left the area by that time. William Bradford reported he \\"went to Virginia, and ther dyed\\", although no record of Leister in Virginia has been found.

Introduced in the early 1960s, Htrae is a cube-shaped planet, home to Bizarro and companions, all of whom were initially Bizarro versions of Superman, Lois Lane and their children and, later, other Bizarros including Batzarro, the World's Worst Detective. In popular culture, \\"Bizarro World\\" has come to mean a situation or setting which is weirdly inverted or opposite to expectations. History In the Bizarro world of \\"Htrae\\", society is ruled by the Bizarro Code which states \\"Us do opposite of all Earthly things! Us hate beauty! Us love ugliness! Is big crime to make anything perfect on Bizarro World!\\" In one episode, for example, a salesman is doing a brisk trade selling Bizarro bonds: \\"Guaranteed to lose money for you\\". Later, the mayor appoints Bizarro No. 1 to investigate a crime, \\"Because you are stupider than the entire Bizarro police force put together\\". This is intended and taken as a great compliment. Originally a normal planet, htraE is now cube-shaped. This is due to the intervention of Superman, whoafter being convicted of doing something perfect on htraE, which would normally be a capital offensepointed out that the planet was shaped like a normal spheroid and agreed to cube it if his sentence were commuted.Action Comics (vol. 1) #263‚Äì264 (April‚ÄìMay 1960) Later stories introduced Bizarro versions of Superman's supporting cast, including Bizarro- Perry White, Bizarro-Jimmy Olsen, Bizarro-Morgan Edge, Bizarro-Lucy Lane, Bizarro-Lana Lang and Bizarro-Krypto, created by using the duplicator ray on characters other than Superman and Lois Lane, as well as the children of Bizarro and Bizarro Lois. There was even a Bizarro-Justice League and Legion of Super-Heroes: the Bizarro League and the Legion of Stupor-Heroes. Bizarro- Batman sported a Futility Belt full of cigarette butts, chewed gum, and other such priceless Bizarro treasures. Yellow Lantern had no power from his powerless Ring, was vulnerable to anything colored green and was the most easily frightened being in the universe. Bizarro-Aquaman could not swim. There is even a Bizarro-Marilyn Monroe, the ugliest of them all. \\"Tales of the Bizarro World\\" became a recurring segment in Adventure Comics for fifteen issues from writer Jerry Siegel and artist John Forte, running from issue #285‚Äì299 (June 1961‚ÄìAug. 1962).This material has been collected as Superman: Tales of the Bizarro World, DC Comics, 2000 . Animated Blue Kryptonite golems once erupted from the Htrae surface, bent on defeating the Bizarros and were cheered on by the Bizarro Loises.Adventure Comics #290 (November 1961) Despite their differences, Bizarro and Superman have teamed up on occasion. One notable example happened in Superman #379, when a strange creature appeared to be devouring Bizarros. Fearing he would end up alone Bizarro tried to steal Superman's duplicator ray. Superman convinced Bizarro he would be better off trying to stop the monster before making any more Bizarros. The creature eventually devoured Bizarro, but Superman soon figured out that the creature was not trying to kill the Bizarros, but using their combined strength to defeat another creature which was trying to destroy htraE. The first creature was created as part of a plan developed by none other than the Bizarro Lex Luthor, who Bizarro referred to as a \\"punk hero.\\" In the imaginary story, Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?, which served as an ending to Silver Age Superman continuity, Bizarro #1 (the original Bizarro and the world's leader/greatest hero), was influenced to bad ends by the now evil Mr. Mxyzptlk. Realizing that to truly fulfill the Bizarro Code he should stop being an \\"imperfect perfect duplicate\\" of Superman and be a \\"perfect imperfect duplicate\\" of Superman, Bizarro resolves to alter his methods accordingly. To that end, Bizarro #1 deliberately destroyed Bizarro World, reasoning that if Superman's homeworld (Krypton) was destroyed in an accident, Bizarro must destroy his own world on purpose. The Bizarro World's final pre-Crisis appearance was in DC Comics Presents #97 (September 1986), which was also the final issue of that series. After being empowered by a hideously disfigured Phantom Zone sorcerer, Mr. Mxyzptlk destroys Zrfff and then causes the Bizarro World to implode, killing all its inhabitants. The Bizarros act unusually insane in this account, with Bizarro #1 rocketing his son to the core of the collapsing planet so he would be sure to die. It had been established that there was no \\"set\\" future for Earth-OneSuperman #295 (January, 1976) so the World's Finest story where it is revealed that sometime in the future, Htrae is transformed into a more normal world (egg-shaped rather than cubical) by the radiation from an exploding celestial body was only a possible future. The Bizarroes are changed into normal non-powered people as well, but still retaining vestiges of their Bizarro laws (curtains hung outside the windows of a house, etc.)World's Finest Comics #181 (December, 1968) After the Crisis on Infinite Earths, John Byrne's Man of Steel miniseries rebooted Superman continuity. The editors and writers did not reintroduce Bizarro World in the reboot. Later, in Superman (vol. 2) #87, the second Post-Crisis Bizarro clone creates a \\"Bizarro World\\" which is a warehouse made to look like a surreal Metropolis. A Bizarro World did appear in a story of this era in the 1998 Adventure Comics 80-Page Giant by writer Tom Peyer and artist Kevin O'Neill. There, Bizarro demands that a technician at a SETI-like installation broadcast his diary. Having no choice, the technician looks over the diary, which retells the story of the classic cube-shaped backwards Bizarro World. Superman accidentally finds himself there and, to allay people's fears of him,This is not the first time Superman is the terror of Bizarro World. In a 1961 story, when Bizarro #1 goes to Earth and brings back a Superman doll as a souvenir, the children are terrified. goes on a \\"constructive rampage.\\" The original Bizarro, aka Bizarro #1, goes to Earth and attempts to stop Superman with the help of his friends. However, when the other Bizarros try to kill Superman, #1 stops them, saying that killing is the earthly thing that they must, above all, do the opposite of. Realizing that, however strange Bizarro World might be, its inhabitants are safer and happier than those of Earth thanks to Bizarro #1's leadership, Superman apologizes. To show his sincerity he hides a copy of the Bizarro Code where nobody will ever see it. The people hold a parade in #1's honor and with his loving wife Bizarro Lois #1 and their son, Bizarro Junior #1 at his side, Bizarro cries saying \\"Me am ... happiest creature in universe.\\" When the technician finishes reading the story, he sees Bizarro is gone and, horrified, asks, \\"What if the journal itself is no exception to the Bizarro Code?\\". Elsewhere, the truth is revealed; Bizarro, who has no home and has no family and is held in contempt by Superman, weeps because he is the most miserable thing in the universe. The distinctive cube- shaped Earth of Bizarro World briefly appeared in the pages of Infinite Crisis alongside the other Earths in space. A close-up, labeled Earth-0, is seen wherein a smiling Bizarro is strangling a smiling Bizarro-Lois, with Bizarros Hawkman, Jimmy Olsen, and Perry White standing alongside and laughing. Similarly, in the present day New 52 DC Multiverse, a cube shaped Earth-29 appears, albeit encircled by a ring. This may or may not be a further reiteration of the Bizarro World.http://www.dccomics.com A cube-shaped planet, populated by assorted Bizarros, was discovered orbiting a blue sun by a Thanagarian patrol ship. Bizarro captures Jonathan Kent and takes him to the cube-shaped world, prompting Superman to follow him.Action Comics (vol. 1) #855 (October 2007) The DC Universe Halloween Special 2009 features several stories showcasing Bizarro World. The opening shows Bizarro reading a comic book to a large audience of Bizarro men and women clad in halloween costumes. All of the audience members are bound and gagged, implying that they are being read to against their will as opposed to the traditional practice of gathering around to hear a story. Another tale reveals that Halloween in Bizarro World involves trick-or-treaters giving fruit to the houses they visit. The final story also reveals that Bizarro works at a Bizarro version of the Daily Planet, and also shows Bizarro versions of staff members like Jimmy Olsen and Cat Grant. Superman #695 has Bizarro fleeing from Mon-El after a battle. In Bizarro-speak, Bizarro informs the hero that he is retreating to Bizarro World, and claims that he will soon return with a Bizarro Mon-El in order to help him defeat the original. This story was never followed up on, as Mon-El was sent into the Phantom Zone shortly after this encounter. Bizarro World was seen again several months later in Supergirl #55. In it, Bizarro Supergirl (not the one accidentally created in Superman #140) recounts her origin, revealing that she was bound, gagged and locked inside of a spaceship sent from the cube-shaped world to Earth after it was attacked by a being known as the Godship. The issue ended with the modern Supergirl, Kara Zor-El, heading toward the Bizarro World to liberate it from the Godship. In Grant Morrison's Multiversity series, htraE has been allocated its own alternate universe and is now also known as Earth-29. As well as its imperfect inorganic equivalents of Earth-0's core superheroes, it retains its cubic shape, although now possesses a ring as well. Other planets in its universe are also cuboid in shapeNarr (Rann-29), Raganaht (Thanagar-29) home to a flightless Bizarro Manhawk (Hawkman) and an overpopulated Sram (Mars-29) home to Smarian Snitch (Martian Manhunter).Multiversity Guidebook (January 2015) Known inhabitants * Bizarro ‚Äì The Bizarro version of Superman. * Bizarro Amazo ‚Äì The Bizarro version of Amazo. * Bizarro Big Barda ‚Äì The Bizarro version of Big Barda. * Bizarro Black Manta ‚Äì The Bizarro version of Black Manta. * Bizarro Brainiac ‚Äì The Bizarro version of Brainiac. * Bizarro Catwoman ‚Äì The Bizarro version of Catwoman. * Bizarro Computo ‚Äì The Bizarro version of Computo. * Bizarro Doomsday ‚Äì The Bizarro version of Doomsday. * Bizarro Jimmy Olsen ‚Äì The Bizarro version of Jimmy Olsen. * Bizarro Joker ‚Äì The only sane person in Bizarro World; he cries incessantly in comparison to the Joker's laughing maniacally. * Bizarro Justice League ‚Äì The Bizarro version of the Justice League. ** Batzarro ‚Äì The Bizarro version of Batman.

Manifestations of Earth inhabitants attacked en masse, killing and absorbing many. The duplicates have a weakness against steroids; they cannot absorb people who use them. Superman believed that Htrae was a manifestation of an entity called a 'planet eater'. Superman attacks htraE, unfortunately experiencing loss of his abilities due to the super-heavy gravity pull of htraE as it retreats back to its own realm, as well as Doppler shift which replicates the effects of red sun radiation, eroding his superpowers. On this revisionist htraE, Superman encounters Bizarro duplicates of Jor-El (\\"Le-Roj\\") and an imperfect clone of Bizarro himself (Zibarro, who is essentially a powerless, rational human). Superman also encounters Bizarro versions of his fellow heroes, such as Bizarro Green Lantern (whose ring allows him to create anything he thinks of, to which he admits he thinks of everything), Bizarro Flash (who is extremely slow and appears to take an entire issue to get to a certain point), Bizarro Batman (who was shot by his parents) and Bizarro Wonder Woman (who is an ugly fat woman that turned to clay). The area Superman lands resembles a destroyed city. There is also an imperfect duplicate of the Statue of Liberty visible in the background, although unnamed. Htrae vanishes back into the Underverse, a newly discovered dimension, at story's end.All-Star Superman #7‚Äì8 (June‚ÄìAugust 2007) =Adventures of Superman= A story about Bizarro in the out-of- continuity digital-first anthology comic book Adventures of Superman from 2013 by Christos Gage and Eduardo Francisco ends with Bizarro given the tools to terraform an uninhabited planet to his own tastes. There, he immediately encounters an Amazonian woman with chalky skin who introduces herself as Bizarra.In the digital numbering, this is in Adventures of Superman #27; in print it is the single-issue Adventures of Superman #9. In other media =Television= * Bizarro World is depicted in several episodes of Super Friends: \\"The Revenge of Bizarro\\" from 1980, \\"Bizarowurld\\" from 1981, and \\"The Bizarro Super Powers Team\\" in 1985. * In the Superman: The Animated Series episode \\"Bizarro's World\\", Bizarro finds the Fortress of Solitude where he interacts with Brainiac and discovers his \\"origin\\". Soon he creates his own Krypton on a section of Metropolis and uses a theater as the House of El. Later, Superman gives Bizarro his own world to protect, a planet with vegetation and a green sky showing a neighboring Saturn-like planet, and several other moons. Bizarro is astute enough to realize he may be set up when he complains \\"Me hate planet. It am empty. How can me be protector when me have no one to protect?\\" However, Superman states he thought of that issue and allows Bizzaro to adopt one of the endangered species from the Fortress, whom Bizarro aptly names \\"Krypto\\". The episode is based on the comic book Superman (vol. 2) #87. In a follow-up episode, \\"Little Big Head Man\\", Bizarro had populated his world with mannequins he made of boulders and twigs, and pretended to \\"protect\\" the populace. In his own \\"Fortress of Solitude\\", there are twig mannequins of his \\"parents\\" holding a large cube-shaped boulder, a crude mirror image of Superman's statue in the Fortress of Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van holding up a globe of Krypton. Mr. Mxyzptlk appears and tricks him into returning to Earth and attacking Superman. Bizarro is eventually returned to his world with his new sidekick Mxyzptlk (who had been temporarily stripped of his powers until he does one good deed by the end of 90 days) who helps to make life on Bizarro World interesting for Bizarro. *A version of Bizarro World appears in the Teen Titans Go! episode \\"Robin Backwards\\".

Here, Bizarro is sent to Bizarro World by Superman to keep him out of trouble. When Darkseid invades the planet, Bizarro steals a duplicating ray from Lex Luthor and fires it at Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (Guy Gardner), and Cyborg, creating Batzarro, Bizarra, Greezarro, and Cyzarro. Its properties were also shown to adversely affect Wonder Woman (who becomes powerless and constantly tripping up), Guy Garnder's power ring (limiting him to only make chickens), and Cyborg (who's falling apart). =Video games= * Bizarro World appears in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. It is featured as a DLC map where the Bizarro Justice League have to defend Bizarro World from Darkseid's forces. In popular culture The concept of \\"Bizarro\\" has been ingrained in popular culture where it has come to mean a weirdly mutated version of anything, not confined to characters in DC Comics publicationsDon Markstein's Toonopedia: Bizarro and as such, so has the concept of Bizarro World. =Saturday Night Live= \\"The Bizarro World\\" was the subject of a sketch which aired during the second episode of season 7 of Saturday Night Live. =Friends= In season 1, Joey tells Ross that him kissing Chandler's mom would be no big deal if it happened in \\"Bizarro World\\". =Seinfeld= The concept of \\"Bizarro World\\" is a fundamental element in \\"The Bizarro Jerry\\", the 137th episode of American sitcom Seinfeld. In the episode, Elaine makes a new group of friends who represent inverted types of the normal Seinfeld gang. Jerry labels his counterpart \\"Bizarro Jerry\\", much to Elaine's confusion. These characters are kind, considerate, curious about the world around them, and good citizens. Though Elaine is initially attracted to their friendly ways, she is ultimately turned off by the formality and lack of simple camaraderie which she enjoys with her old, selfish, shortsighted group. A second reason for her leaving the Bizarro group is the fact that she is, in turn, so flawed that the Bizarro group reject her in much the same way that Elaine rejected her old friends. Conceivably, her Bizarro version would be ladylike. To this day, fans still write in and tell the producers of the show of all the things that can be pointed out in the background of the Bizarro apartment. These include a Bizarro figure on an apartment shelf, just as a Superman figure sits on a shelf in Jerry's apartment. Viewers can also see a unicycle hanging from the wall instead of a bicycle, and images of horses instead of cars. The locks on the doors are on the opposite side and actually used. At the end, one of the Bizarro group says: \\"Me am so happy, me want to cry\\"‚Äîa reference to the way Bizarro speaks. =Buffyverse= The character Cordelia Chase from the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel referenced the concept on several occasions. * In the Buffy Season 2 episode \\"Reptile Boy\\", Cordelia tells Xander Harris that his being accepted into a fraternity of rich and powerful men would only happen \\"in the Bizarro World.\\" * In the Buffy Season 3 episode \\"The Wish\\", an alternate reality is brought about by a wish made by Cordelia. After learning that the AU vampire versions of Xander Harris and Willow Rosenberg are partners, Cordelia exclaims \\"No way! I wish us into bizarro-land, and you guys are still together?! I cannot win!\\" * In the Angel Season 5 episode \\"You're Welcome\\", Cordelia awakens from a coma to discover that Spike has regained his soul and Angel is working for Wolfram & Hart. Cordelia remarks to Angel \\"OK, Spike's a hero, and you're CEO of Hell, Incorporated. What freakin' bizarro world did I wake up in?!\\" Buffy Summers also referenced \\"Bizarro World\\" in the season 6 episode \\"Gone.\\" Following an argument with her then lover Spike, Buffy walks home grumbling to herself \\"I don't believe this.

It is affiliated with the World Association of Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) and the World Scout Movement (WOSM). This connection allows the Association to participate in major global programs related to health, nutrition, world peace, environmental protection and integration of disabled into society, among other social issues of concern to the Association. Additionally, the affiliation grants the Association consultative status with the United Nations on matters concerning childhood and youth, and also membership in the Scout Parliamentary Union, consisting in Chile of more than thirty members. History In 1909, the second Scout Association in the world was founded in Chile. It was inspired by the direct influence of Robert Baden- Powell who visited the country that same year. The founder of the Chilean Scouting movement was Alcib√≠ades Vicencio. The Girl Guide Association of Chile was founded in 1935. After a long process, the two national associations, the Chilean Scout Association and the Catholic Scout Federation merged in 1978 to form the Asociaci√≥n de Gu√≠as y Scouts de Chile. The Asociaci√≥n de Gu√≠as y Scouts de Chile hosted the 19th World Jamboree at Picarqu√≠n in December 1999. This was the first World Jamboree in South America. Scouts de Chile hosted about 30,000 Scouts with 1,343 Chilean staff and 5,625 Chilean Scouts participating. Program Scouting in Chile has been a forerunner in social projects. The Asociaci√≥n de Gu√≠as y Scouts de Chile have a center in the south, where they are involved in assisting poor children by providing meals, clothes and help with schooling. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the conditions to the point where the children will be able to return home. There is also a project in the poorer sections of Santiago. Several Scout groups have been formed for very poor children, giving them a meal a day and helping them to learn Scouting skills that will lead them to improve their living conditions. Programs have been established for disabled children. Scouts help with disaster relief. After one earthquake, Scouts took charge of shelters caring for thousands of victims.

It is one of the largest piranhas, reaching a maximum length of 50 cm in the wild, and is sometimes considered the most beautiful, with its orange to yellow belly coloration, silver eyes, and rayed fibrous adipose fin. Like most other piranhas, P. piraya is laterally compressed and roughly circular in profile, and bears a mouthful of very sharp teeth. The lower jaw is thick, strong, and protruding. It is known by many vernacular names, such as Rio S√£o Francisco piranha, black-tailed piranha, and king emperor piranha, and locally it is simply termed piraya. This fish is an omnivore, but when hungry, stressed, or seeking live food it is very aggressive. This characteristic combined with its large size make it a danger to humans. Piranha attacks on humans are anecdotal for the most part. The piraya prefers to eat small fish and insects, along with seeds and aquatic plant material. The piraya is sometimes available as an aquarium fish. It is not generally bred in captivity, so aquarium pirayas are usually imported from South America and can be expensive. Any other fish sharing a tank with a piraya should be of the same or a similar piranha species. Other types of fish will be attacked and eaten.

A double album, it was warmly received by the public, reaching number 97 on America's Billboard chart. Uncut magazine's reviewer wrote: \\"Concerts like these are usually long on sentiment and short on worthwhile content.

Du Noyer said of the live album, \\"Its sins are only those of omission\\", and recommended the accompanying DVD release, before concluding: \\"In either format, however, [Joe Brown's] show-closing 'I‚Äôll See You In My Dreams' is an exquisitely poignant note to end upon.\\" In 2005, the Concert for George DVD won the Best Long Form Video Grammy.

Its first chairman was Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. Jewish communal affairs were generally conducted through a hierarchy of representative organizations, including the JNC. Another of these organizations was the Assembly of Representatives (Mandatory Palestine), which had three hundred members who selected from among themselves the members of the National Council.Cleveland, William L., and Martin P.

It is almost always sold and used in combination with clavulanate as ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. Because it is a penicillin, it also falls within the larger class of beta-lactam antibiotics. Its main clinical use is as an injectable antibiotic for the treatment of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is also one of the few antibiotics capable of treating Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections. It is provided as a white or pale-yellow powder. It is highly soluble in water, but should be dissolved only immediately before use to prevent degradation. It was patented in 1963.  Mechanism of action  Ticarcillin's antibiotic properties arise from its ability to prevent cross- linking of peptidoglycan during cell wall synthesis, when the bacteria try to divide, causing cell death. Ticarcillin, like penicillin, contains a Œ≤-lactam ring that can be cleaved by beta-lactamases, resulting in inactivation of the antibiotic. Those bacteria that can express Œ≤-lactamases are, therefore, resistant to Œ≤-lactam antibiotics. Due, at least in part, to the common Œ≤-lactam ring, ticarcillin can cause reactions in patients allergic to penicillin. Ticarcillin is also often paired with a Œ≤-lactamase inhibitor such as clavulanic acid (co-ticarclav). Other uses In molecular biology, ticarcillin is used to as an alternative to ampicillin to test the uptake of marker genes into bacteria. It prevents the appearance of satellite colonies that occur when ampicillin breaks down in the medium. It is also used in plant molecular biology to kill Agrobacterium, which is used to deliver genes to plant cells.  Dosing and administration  Ticarcillin is not absorbed orally, so must be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection.  Trade names and preparations  * Ticarcillin: Ticar was formerly marketed by Beecham, then SmithKline Beecham until 1999, when it merged with Glaxo to form GlaxoSmithKline; it is no longer available in the UK. US distribution ceased in 2004. Ticar was replaced by Timentin. However Timentin contains clavulanate unlike Ticar * Ticarcillin/clavulanate: Timentin, in Australia, the UK, and the US, was marketed by Beecham, then GlaxoSmithKline. Synthesis Carbenicillin is used in the clinic primarily because of its low toxicity and its utility in treating urinary tract infections due to susceptible Pseudomonas species. Its low potency, low oral activity, and susceptibility to bacterial beta-lactamases make it vulnerable to replacement by agents without these deficits. One contender in this race is ticaricillin. Its origin depended on the well-known fact that a divalent sulfur is roughly equivalent to a vinyl group (cf methiopropamine, sufentanil, pizotyline etc.). Ticarcillin synthesis: GEORGE BRAIN EDWARD, CHARLES NAYLER JOHN HERBERT; (1964 to Beecham). One synthesis began by making the monobenzyl ester of 3-Thienylmalonic acid, converting this to the acid chloride with SOCl2, and condensing it with 6-Aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA). Hydrogenolysis (Pd/C) completed the synthesis of ticarcillin.

Weroances were under a paramount chief called Powhatan. The Powhatan Confederacy, encountered by the colonists of Jamestown and adjacent area of the Virginia Colony beginning in 1607, spoke an Algonquian language. Each tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy was led by its own weroance. Most foreign writers who have come across a weroance only did so on a special occasion. This is the case because a foreigners presence was special. John Smith noted that there are few differences between weroances and their subjects. In older texts, especially from the time of the early Jamestown settlers, spelling was not standardized, so the following spellings are used in different texts: * weeroance * weroance * werowance * werowans * wyroance * wyrounce * wyrounnces A weroansqua is a female ruler. Spellings of this word also vary. Powers of a weroance Paramount chiefs let their district and subordinate weroances make the final decision on how to handle a hostile situation. This was made apparent with the events that took place in 1607 and the hostility with the newcomers (English settlers). Weroances and Priest were the only ones allowed to enter into religious temples. A weroance did not go to meet any visitor, visitors were escorted to see a weroance. The weroance, their wives, and councilors often dressed in the finest jewels, and tanned deer skin. Individual weroances Several of the weroances' personal names were known and some recorded by William Strachey and other sources.List of weroances recorded by Strachey The names of their respective chieftaincies were also commonly used as titles, exactly analogous to European peerages, so that the Weroance of Arrohattec (whose given name was Ashaquid) was often referred to simply as \\"Arrohattec\\", much as the Earl of Essex would be referred to just as \\"Essex\\" in lieu of a personal name. When the English arrived in Virginia, some of the weroances subject to the paramount chief Powhatan, or mamanatowick (Wahunsenacawh) were his own nearest male relatives: * Parahunt, Weroance of the Powhatan (proper), also called Tanx (\\"little\\") Powhatan, said by Strachey to be a son of the paramount chief Powhatan, and often confused with same. * Pochins, Weroance of the Kecoughtan, was also a son of the paramount chief, whom he had appointed there some time after slaying their previous ruler in ca. 1598. *Opechancanough, Chief Powhatan's younger brother, was a weroance of the Pamunkey, but increased in power, and came to be the effective ruler of the entire Powhatan Confederacy after Wahunsenacawh's death in 1618. Matrilineal inheritance In Powhatan society, women could inherit power, because the inheritance of power was matrilineal. In A Map of Virginia John Smith of Jamestown explains: > His [Chief Powhatan's] kingdome descendeth not to his sonnes nor children: > but first to his brethren, whereof he hath 3 namely Opitchapan, > Opechancanough, and Catataugh; and after their decease to his sisters. First > to the eldest sister, then to the rest: and after them to the heires male > and female of the eldest sister; but never to the heires of the males.Smith, > John. A Map of Virginia.

A bedpan can be used for both urinary and fecal discharge. Many diseases can confine a patient to bed, necessitating the use of bedpans, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and dementia. Additionally, many patients may be confined to a bed temporarily as a result of a temporary illness, injury, or surgery. Bedpans are usually constructed of stainless steel, which is easy to clean and durable, but may be cold, hard, and uncomfortable to use. Also, the supporting area of some products is very small, and prolonged use can cause pressure ulcers. To solve these problems, ergonomic bedpans have been developed, which support the patient with a larger area of less-conductive plastic. Some designs completely cover the genitalia during use, offering protection and an extra measure of privacy. On the other hand, the material is more difficult to sterilize, and may become a reservoir for microorganisms. Fracture bedpans are smaller than standard size bedpans, and have one flat end. These bedpans are designed specifically for patients who have had a hip fracture or are recovering from hip replacement. This type of bedpan may be used for those patients who cannot raise their hips high enough or roll over onto a regular size bedpan. In recent years, single-use bedpan liners made of recycled wood pulp (molded pulp) have become more widely used in UK hospitals; they decrease the risk of cross-contamination. Another alternative is the plastic bedpan liner. Some liners are made of biodegradable plastic and contain absorbent powder to eliminate splashing and spills. Liners are used in hospitals to decrease infection, and are also used for home health care.

Long Bridge, located in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, is a cantilevered steel through-truss bridge that carries a two-track railroad line over the Mississippi River at mile 106.1 with three lanes of US 90 on each side of the central tracks. Opened in December 1935, the bridge was named for the late Governor Huey P. Long, who had been assassinated on September 8 of that year. It has been plaguing Surface Warfare Officers in the United States Navy ever since its inclusion in COLREGS. The bridge was the first Mississippi River span built in Louisiana and the 29th along the length of the river. It is several kilometers upriver from the city of New Orleans. The East Bank entrance is at Elmwood, Louisiana, and the West Bank at Bridge City. It was designed by Polish-American engineer Ralph Modjeski. On June 16, 2013, a $1.2 billion widening project by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development was completed and opened to motorists. The bridge now consists of three 3.3-meter (11-foot) lanes in each direction, with inside and outside shoulders. Prior to the expansion, there were two 2.7-meter (9-foot) lanes in each direction with no shoulders. In both cases, the road lanes flanked the twin railroad tracks contained within the truss. in 2014, a writer in The New Yorker described the bridge as \\"a structure so vaulting and high that it seems to extend from one white, towering Gulf Coast cloud to the next.\\"Frazier, Ian, \\"Streetscape: Do Not Cross,\\" The New Yorker, June 2, 2014, p. 26. Structure USS New Orleans passes under the bridge, March 2007 The widest clear span is long while each of the three additional spans are 530 feet (158 m) long making the total river crossing about 2,400 feet (732 m) long. There are three navigation channels below the bridge, the widest being . The vertical clearance below the structure is 152.9 feet (46.6 m).US0090 over MISSISSIPPI RIVER, BridgeReports.com National Bridge Inventory Data. The distinctive rail structure is long and extends as rail viaducts well into the city on both sides of the river from the central spans. It has sometimes been described as the longest rail bridge in the US, but the nearby Norfolk Southern Lake Pontchartrain Bridge, at , is considerably longer. The highway structure is long with steep grades on both sides. As originally constructed, each roadway deck was wide, with two nine-foot lanes; but because of the railroad component, it is unusually flat. Normally, bridges its height have a hump, but this bridge was designed flat to facilitate rail traffic.http://www.johnweeks.com/lower_mississippi/pages/lmiss16.html The bridge is a favorite railfan location. It is owned by the New Orleans Public Belt Railroad, which is owned by the City of New Orleans and managed by the Public Belt Railroad Commission. The bridge was hated by many drivers in the New Orleans area due to the narrow lanes without shoulders before it was widened. Additionally, where the East Bank approach met the superstructure of the bridge, the two vehicular roadways \\"jogged\\" or shifted inwards towards the bridge centerline about since the through-truss portion of the superstructure was wider than the deck truss portion of the east approach. The foundation of the bridge is also unique. The land in and around New Orleans was formed by silt deposits brought down the Mississippi River. The clay topsoil, known colloquially as \\"gumbo soil,\\" (notorious for its role in the Hurricane Katrina levee failures) is compressible and unsuitable for foundation loads. As bedrock is around below the surface, making it too deep for normal bridge foundation construction, the main piers are seated on a layer of fine sand 160 to below Mean Gulf Level and rely on their size and mass to hold them in place. The bridge dates from an era when large bridges mixing rail tracks and highways were common, as typified by the MacArthur Bridge and McKinley Bridge in St. Louis, Missouri and the Harahan Bridge in Memphis, Tennessee. A second Huey P. Long Bridge, which is very similar to the design of this bridge in New Orleans before its renovation, was built further upstream in 1940 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. While both of the Long bridges still carry both types of traffic, most of the others have been converted either to entirely rail use (Harahan since 1949, MacArthur since 1981) or exclusive road use (McKinley since 1978), sometimes with bicycle and/or pedestrian use added (McKinley in 2007, Harahan in 2016). History As early as 1892 the Southern Pacific Railway proposed a high level bridge, but a depression that year prevented further work on a project that would have been an overwhelming challenge for the engineers of the time due to soil conditions and extremely high clearances for river navigation. With the development of the Public Belt Railroad, interest in a river rail crossing grew and led to passage of a constitutional amendment in 1916 granting the city exclusive power to build and operate a crossing. Three general ideas emerged from the planning process: a low-level drawbridge, a tunnel, and a high-level bridge. The tunnel idea died first because it would have provided limited capacity and the War Department (after years of wrangling) ultimately rejected the idea of a drawbridge as too problematic for such a significant concentration of vital transportation infrastructure. Work on the design of the bridge began in earnest in 1925 by the engineering firm of Modjeski and Masters. Some pilings were actually driven that year to prevent expiration of congressional authority and provide further information for the design. As the magnitude of the project became apparent and projected costs ballooned, financing difficulties compounded by the Great Depression delayed the project. Finally, on November 5, 1932, the bonds of the Public Belt Railroad Commission were guaranteed by a complex agreement between the Southern Pacific Railroad, the City of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana. Principal construction contracts were signed on December 30, 1932 and work formally started the following day. Construction of the bridge proceeded smoothly over a three-year period with only minor interruptions due to high water and a one-month strike in September 1933. Expansion The Huey P. Long Bridge Widening Project is a TIMED (Transportation Infrastructure Model for Economic Development) Program project. The TIMED Program was created by Act 16 of the 1989 Louisiana Legislature, was voted for by the people and is the single largest transportation program in state history. The Program is designed to enhance economic development in Louisiana through an investment in transportation projects. The $1.2 billion widening project started in April 2006 and is the first change to the structure since it opened in 1935. The project expanded the highway on each side of the structure from two 9-foot lanes to three 11-foot lanes with a 2-foot inside shoulder and an 8-foot outside shoulder. It also included new signalized intersections to replace the traffic circle at Jefferson Highway and Bridge City Avenue in Jefferson Parish, LA. =Project Details= This seven-year-long, four-phase project was completed in 2013. The timeline of the project was as follows: Phase I: Main Support Widening (Piers) In this phase, completed in May 2009, four river piers and one land pier were widened to support the additional lanes. Reinforcing framework and concrete filled the void sections of the piers to strengthen them. In addition, w-shaped metal bridge struts were anchored to the upper part of each pier to support the additional new trusses and the existing truss. Phase II: Railroad Modifications In October 2006, work to relocate five selected railroad supports was done to facilitate the construction of the new approaches. This phase was completed in June 2008. Phase III: Main Bridge Widening (Truss) Completed in 2012, this phase widened the existing truss on either side to accommodate new travel lanes and shoulders. The bridge, which is composed of four spans, was erected one span at a time. In November 2009, construction of the West Bank Anchor Span began by using the stick-built method, meaning each element of the span was individually placed. In order to minimize the use of falsework and river closures in the navigation or auxiliary channels the three remaining spans were done through the span-by- span method. This method involved large barges transporting a pre-assembled span section, positioning it under the bridge, and lifting it into position using strand jacks. Temporary stability frames made up of floorbeams and towers were used to support the span section during the lifting process. This phase was completed on April 29, 2012, when traffic was shifted from the original lanes (two 9-foot lanes in each direction, cantilevered on each side of the original truss) to two temporary lanes in each direction on the widened portion of the truss. Phase IV: New Approaches Construction During this phase of the project, the two temporary lanes were widened to three 11-foot lane in each direction with 8-foot shoulders and 2-foot inside shoulders. The traffic circles at each end of the bridge were replaced with signalized intersections. Also, new roadway and elevated structures were constructed. Four cameras were installed to view the approaches and ramps construction‚Äî two on the East Bank of Jefferson Parish and two on the West Bank of Jefferson Parish. On February 5, 2013, Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development Secretary Sherri LeBas announced that the bridge would be fully open to drivers on June 16, 2013.

Generally he is considered one of the pioneers of modern sumo. He remains the lightest yokozuna in the history of the sport with a weight of 104 kg. Early career He was born , but later changed his surname to . He entered sumo in February 1911, using the shikona until changing the given name to Moriya in January 1914. His coach Hitachiyama Taniemon did not expect him to be strong owing to his light weight. However, Tochigiyama lost only 3 bouts on his way to the top makuuchi division, achieving promotion in January 1915. Tochigiyama defeated Tachiyama Mineemon, ending his series of 56 victories, on the 8th day of the May 1916 tournament. Tochigiyama was promoted to ≈çzeki in May 1917. After he won his first two championships at ≈çzeki without suffering a single defeat, he was promoted to yokozuna in February 1918. Yokozuna Tochigiyama won a third championship during his first tournament as yokozuna. He also won the following two tournaments, meaning he achieved five consecutive championships between May 1917 and May 1919. Tochigiyama defeated other wrestlers with his strong oshi, or pushing techniques. He compensated for his lack of weight by training extremely hard. He was nicknamed the \\"little giant yokozuna\\". Like Hitachiyama before him, he trained many wrestlers, such as later yokozuna Tamanishiki San'emon, even though they were not members of the Dewanoumi stable. In May 1925, he suddenly retired after winning three consecutive championships between January 1924 and January 1925. Asked about his retirement, he stated that he wanted to retire while still a strong opponent. The painter Foujita made his portrait in sumotori in 1926 in Paris; the painting is kept in the mus√©e de Grenoble (France). Tochigiyama only lost 23 times while an active sumo wrestler in the top makuuchi division, and only eight times during his seven years as yokozuna. His top division winning percentage was 87.8. In addition, his winning percentage as yokozuna reached 93.5, the fourth best in history after Jinmaku, Tachiyama and Tanikaze. Retirement from sumo After his retirement, he was permitted to leave Dewanoumi stable and become the eighth head coach of Kasugano stable. He was the adopted son of its previous head coach, referee Kimura Soshiro. In his tenure, Tochigiyama produced yokozuna Tochinishiki Kiyotaka. In June 1931, Tochigiyama took part in the first , special sumo tournament. To the surprise of many, he defeated Tamanishiki and Tenry≈´, and won the championship. In the modern age, retired wrestlers can no longer take part in any special sumo tournaments. In 1952 he performed his kanreki dohy≈ç-iri or '60th year ring entrance ceremony' to commemorate his years as yokozuna. His strength hardly declined long into his retirement. It is reported that Tochigiyama in his sixties easily carried a large hibachi which none of his other junior stable members could move. He died suddenly in 1959 whilst still in charge of Kasugano stable. Tochinishiki, who Tochigiyama had in turn adopted as his son, took over as head coach of the stable.

Its goal is to structure portfolios with uncorrelated investment returns based on risk allocations rather than asset allocations. Additionally, the company is reported to accept funds from only institutional clients such as pension funds, foundations, endowments, and central banks rather than private investors. =Separation of alpha and beta= The company divides its investments into two basic categories: (1) Beta investments, whose returns are generated through passive management and standard market risk, and (2) Alpha investments, whose goal is to generate higher returns that are uncorrelated to the general market and are actively managed. The principle of separating alpha and beta investments was introduced by Dalio in 1990 and gained the recognition of other equity managers beginning in the year 2000. The firm is reported to be the first hedge fund manager to separate alpha and beta investment strategies and offer dedicated investment funds for each.Leim, Harry (2007) 2020 Vision: Investment Wisdom for Tomorrow, page 19, Pub:Mercer 2007 =Systematic diversification= According to Bloomberg, Bridgewater uses an investing system that combines traditional diversification with \\"wager[s] on or against markets around the world\\" and attempts to invest in instruments and markets that do not \\"move in lock step\\" with each other.

Roger Collins notes this was the first time a Visigothic king is mentioned in the north-eastern region of the realm since 531, when Amalaric was murdered.

Some programs are more flexible than others in allowing for the input of children born out of wedlock or for varying types of spousal relationships. Additionally, most genealogy programs handle additional events in an individual's life, notes, photographs and multimedia, and source citations. Genealogy software programs can produce a variety of graphical charts and text reports, such as pedigree charts, ahnentafel reports, and Register reports. Some desktop applications generate HTML pages for web publishing; there are stand-alone web applications, as well. Most genealogy programs can import and export using the GEDCOM standard. There are also some programs that allow users to create Genograms which can be used by scientists, social workers, doctors, and others to get a graphical view of additional information. Some programs include additional fields relevant to particular religions. Others focus on certain geographical regions. For example, having a field for the family's coat of arms is only relevant if the family comes from a part of the world that uses them. While most programs and applications are desktop-based, there are a number of web- based products in the genealogy software market. Many genealogy applications focus on data management in that they allow users to manage all the information they collect on individuals, families, and events. Other tools available to the genealogist include research management tools, mapping tools, charting programs, and web-publishing programs. Sharing Most genealogy software allows export of data in GEDCOM format, which can then be shared with people using different genealogy software. Some genealogy applications use GEDCOM internally and therefore work directly with GEDCOM data. Certain programs allow the user to restrict what information is shared, usually by inhibiting export of some or all personal information about living people for privacy reasons.

It stars Danny Kaye who plays, as in many of his films, two roles ‚Äî in this case, an American soldier and a British General. Plot England, 1944. After an attempt on the life of British high commander General Sir Lawrence MacKenzie-Smith (Danny Kaye) by German intelligence, all military camps in England are sealed off, resulting in leaves of absence being revoked. Ernie Williams (Kaye), a most reluctant American soldier, hypochondriac and talented mimic, and his fellow conscript Joseph Praeger (Jesse White) are thus left trapped in an Allied army camp in southeast England just before they can return to the States. In order to relieve his frustration, Ernie impersonates MacKenzie during dinner in the mess hall; a British officer entering the building falls for his disguise, sparking the idea in Praeger to use Ernie as a double to get them out of the camp. However, Praeger's unfamiliarity with cars causes them to be caught before they even get out of sight of the gate guards. The incident and Ernie's remarkable resemblance to MacKenzie cause Allied military intelligence leaders Colonel Somerset (Wilfrid Hyde-White) and Colonel Houston (Gregory Walcott) to consider recruiting Ernie (under threat of court-martial) as the General's political decoy, in order to thwart the assassination plot. After Ernie is presented to MacKenzie in person, the General, after some initial reservations, agrees to the plan. MacKenzie's life is at stake because he is the leading strategist in the upcoming invasion of the European mainland; he is set to travel to Invasion Headquarters, adopting Ernie's identity as his disguise and vice versa in order to deceive German High Command. Only Sergeant Twickenham (Terence De Marney), MacKenzie's batman, is made privy to the situation, as he is to help Ernie maintain the deceit. However, the most vital detail ‚Äì that Ernie will serve as a decoy target for German intelligence ‚Äì is conveniently withheld from him. The situation gradually begins to unravel when Lady Margaret (Dana Wynter), MacKenzie's wife, returns prematurely from a war bond tour in Canada to inform MacKenzie of her intention to divorce him, having tired of his neglect of her and his womanizing. As the result of Ernie's attempts to greet her with innocent marital affection, Lady Margaret quickly recognizes him as an impostor and is out of necessity made familiar with the situation. Taking pity on Ernie, she tells him more private details about MacKenzie which help complement his disguise. However, German intelligence continues its liquidation attempts, which result in Twickenham getting poisoned and a sniping attempt during a rallying speech to the troops, prompting Margaret to tell Ernie the entire truth. However, while trying to hand in his resignation from the project, Ernie and Margaret learn that the plane MacKenzie was travelling on was shot down by the Germans, with all hands lost, forcing Ernie to carry on the charade. At a regimental party where Ernie is supposed to participate, the Secret Service intends to expose and apprehend a traitor who has been feeding information about MacKenzie to the Germans; one of his agents is revealed to be Captain Patterson (Allan Cuthbertson). During the party, Ernie is very nearly exposed as an impostor by his usual blunders and MacKenzie's aggressively domineering aunt, Lady Vivian (Margaret Rutherford). Acting upon Lady Margaret's advice, he pretends to be drunk and have a fight with his wife in order to have an excuse for leaving the party early. Afterwards, in private, Ernie and Margaret confess that they have developed feelings for each other, but then Ernie receives a message that the traitor was apparently caught and that he is ordered back to Headquarters. On his way there, he is kidnapped by Captain Patterson and Sergeant Bridget Stanhope (Diana Dors), MacKenzie's driver and mistress as well as Patterson's accomplice. Ernie is flown to Berlin and interrogated about the Allied invasion plans, and his German captors refuse to believe his desperate attempts to explain that he is a mere decoy. Forced to go along with the game, he begins to blab about non-existent invasion plots, which the Germans readily take for the truth. Once left alone, Ernie acquires a list of German agents in Britain and facilitates his escape from German Headquarters. Chased through the streets of Berlin in the midst of a nocturnal bombing raid, he keeps changing disguises on the proverbial run, including a brief stint as Adolf Hitler and a subsequent cabaret act in a Berlin nightclub as \\"Fr√§ulein Lilli\\" (in the style of Marlene Dietrich as Lola-Lola in The Blue Angel, singing a mash-up of the various running gag catchphrases that have been in use throughout the film in a Germanicized English word salad, all to the tune of the 1934 song Cocktails for Two.) Finally, disguised as a pilot, Ernie boards a German bomber and manages to parachute out over England. Captured, he is brought to General Wiffingham (Rex Evans), a friend of MacKenzie's, but as he reads him the names on his list, Ernie discovers to his dismay that Wiffingham is the chief Nazi infiltrator within the British Secret Service. Somerset has in the meantime figured out Wiffingham's true allegiance on his own, and rescues Ernie before Wiffingham can have him silenced via summary execution by firing squad for espionage. The invasion proceeds smoothly, and what appears to be MacKenzie surprisingly returns from the dead, only to reveal himself to Margaret as Ernie, and the two end the film confessing their love for each other.

The attacks, which left five Hispanic and two white young men with broken bones and ruptured organs, were properly investigated only after lobbying from the Mexican American community. The internal inquiry by Los Angeles Chief of Police William H. Parker resulted in eight police officers being indicted for the assaults, 54 being transferred, and 39 suspended. The event was fictionalized in the 1990 novel L.A. Confidential by James Ellroy, which was made into a film of the same name in 1997.  Background  In 1938, reforms of the LAPD were started by Mayor Frank Shaw. Throughout the 1940s, that led to the firing of corrupt officers, the raise of entrance standards, the creation of rigorous training programs, and better pay for officers. Police autonomy was already guaranteed in Section 202 of the Los Angeles city charter since 1934. It stated that officers had a vested right to their jobs and could not be removed or disciplined without due process, which meant that authority regarding departmental discipline belonged to a board of review made up of police officers. Despite the reforms, the LAPD was faced with a continual deterioration in relations with the Mexican American community since the 1943 Zoot Suit Riots during the Second World War. After William H. Parker was appointed chief of police in 1950, reforms continued with improving policing in Los Angeles by placing emphasis on police professionalism. Parker believed better personnel would lead to more \\"police autonomy,\\" allowing the LAPD to focus on its \\"war-on-crime approach\\" to policing and for dealing with its own internal discipline. Proponents believed a professional police department should be free from political influence and control. Despite previous police chiefs trying to improve relationships by quelling public fears of Mexican American crime, community leaders hoped Parker's appointment would really lead to an improvement in the situation. Problems occurred because of anti-Mexican sentiment among LAPD officers, many of whom believed Mexican Americans were generally delinquent and violent. That racial profiling led to numerous violent encounters between the police and Mexican Americans because each side expected the other to use force.  Officers assaulted  On Christmas Eve 1951, LAPD officers Julius Trojanowski and Nelson Brownson responded to a report that minors were drinking alcohol at the Showboat Bar on Riverside Drive. On arrival, they found inside seven men: Daniel Rodela, Elias Rodela, Jack Wilson, William Wilson, Raymond Marquez, Manuel Hernandez, and Eddie Nora. Even though the men had identification proving they were legally old enough to drink alcohol, the officers told them to leave. When they refused to go, the officers used force, which led to a fight starting in the parking lot. Both police officers were injured; one received a black eye, the other a cut that required stitches. Seven hours after the fight, LAPD officers arrested all the men at their own homes. Six were taken straight to the Los Angeles Central City Jail. However, the seventh, Daniel Rodela, was dragged to a squad car by his hair and driven to the city's Elysian Park, where he was savagely beaten by several police officers. Rodela suffered multiple facial fractures; he required two blood transfusions because of the extent of his injuries. Prisoners beaten On Christmas morning, a large number of police officers attending a departmental Christmas party were getting drunk, in violation of the LAPD's policy on alcohol. When they became aware of a rumor that Trojanowski had lost an eye in the fight, the drunken officers decided to avenge their fellow policeman. The six prisoners were taken from their cells in the Central City Jail and lined up. As many as 50 officers then participated in a beating that lasted for 95 minutes. All the prisoners received major injuries including punctured organs and broken facial bones. At least 100 people knew of or witnessed the beatings.  Cover-up  Senior LAPD management kept the attack on the prisoners out of the mainstream news for almost three months. Media coverage ignored the beatings on Christmas Day and focused on the brawl the night before. The initial headline of the Los Angeles Times on the incident was \\"Officers Beaten in Bar Brawl; Seven Men Jailed\\". However, as Mexican Americans pushed for a focus on police brutality and more reports of violence flooded in, the media began to turn against the LAPD, running stories condemning police tactics and even suggesting the amendment of Section 202 of the Los Angeles city charter. In March 1952, six of the seven men were charged with battery and disturbing the peace. The prosecution argued that the fight started when the officers asked Jack Wilson to leave the bar peacefully. The defendants testified that the fight began when Officer Trojanowski began hitting Wilson on the head with a blackjack. Judge Joseph L. Call also allowed them to describe how they were beaten after being arrested. The jury found the defendants guilty of two counts of battery and one of disturbing the peace. However, after the verdict was delivered, Judge Call reprimanded the police force for its brutality, calling for an independent investigation of the assault. Internal investigation Chief Parker's response to this criticism was defensive. The police department's \\"war-on- crime\\" policy had given it an \\"us versus them\\" mentality. Parker used the argument that the public had to support the police force to prevent anarchy and lawlessness, saying that any criticism against the LAPD damaged the police‚Äôs ability to enforce the law. He even suggested that criminals were alleging police brutality to get him fired so the L.A. underworld could re- establish its illegal activities. However, as the internal investigation into the beatings progressed, more complaints from other incidents were reported by the media, forcing Parker to act. Eventually a 204-page internal report was compiled by the LAPD. Although it included interviews with more than 400 witnesses, many members of LAPD had tried to impede the investigation through perjury or vague testimony. The report was also contradictory because it revealed that several police officers witnessed the beatings but concluded that \\"none of the prisoners was physically abused in the manner alleged.\\" Criminal indictments The report led to grand jury hearings against the LAPD. Throughout the proceedings, the victims gave vivid accounts of their beatings, but the officers' testimonies were vague and contradictory as none could remember seeing the prisoners being beaten or remember who was taking part. Officers who had previously given detailed information to internal affairs investigators could remember very little in court. The hearings resulted in eight officers being indicted for assault. The grand jury also issued a report that criticized the LAPD's senior officers for allowing the situation to get out of control and reminded the police department that it functioned \\"for the benefit of the public and not as a fraternal organization for the benefit of fellow officers.\\" The eight indicted officers were tried between July and November 1952. Five of them were convicted, but only one received a sentence of more than a year in prison. A further 54 officers were transferred, and 39 were temporarily suspended without pay.

In nuclear biology and molecular biology, a marker gene is a gene used to determine if a nucleic acid sequence has been successfully inserted into an organism's DNA. In particular, there are two sub-types of these marker genes: a selectable marker and a marker for screening. In metagenomics and phylogenetics, a marker gene is an orthologous gene group which can be used to delineate between taxonomic lineages. Selectable marker A selectable marker protects the organism from a selective agent that would normally kill it or prevent its growth. In a transformation reaction, depending on the transformation efficiency, only one in several million to billion cells may take up DNA. Rather than checking every single cell, scientists use a selective agent to kill all cells that do not contain the foreign DNA, leaving only the desired ones. Antibiotics are the most common selective agents. In bacteria, antibiotics are used almost exclusively. In plants, antibiotics that kill the chloroplast are often used as well, although tolerance to salts and growth-inhibiting hormones is becoming more popular. In mammals, resistance to antibiotics that would kill the mitochondria is used as a selectable marker. Screenable marker A screenable marker will make cells containing the gene look different. There are three types of screening commonly used: * Green fluorescent protein makes cells glow green under UV light. A specialized microscope is required to see individual cells. Yellow and red versions are also available, so scientists can look at multiple genes at once. It is commonly used to measure gene expression.Chalfie, Martin, et al. \\"Green fluorescent protein as a marker for gene expression.\\" Science 263.5148 (1994): 802-805. * GUS assay (using Œ≤-glucuronidase) is an excellent method for detecting a single cell by staining it blue without using any complicated equipment. The drawback is that the cells are killed in the process. It is particularly common in plant science. * Blue white screen is used in both bacteria and eukaryotic cells. The bacterial lacZ gene encodes a beta-galactosidase enzyme. When media containing certain galactosides (e.g. X-gal), cells expressing the enzyme convert the X-gal to a blue product and can be seen with the naked eye. The strategy is therefore to integrate the DNA insert within the lacZ gene and to select the white colored colonies given they will have correctly integrated the insert. Blue colonies on the other hand will be able to convert the X-gal and give rise to the blue precipitate because the DNA insert either didn't integrate at all, or not at the correct location within the plasmid.

He is generally acclaimed as a founding father of American performance art, and has been critically recognized as a master photographer, though his photographic works are rare and remain largely unknown. Life and career Smith was raised in Texas where he made his first film, Buzzards over Baghdad, in 1952. He moved to New York in 1953.\\"Film Examines Art-World Provocateur\\" By David Ebony, Art in America, May '07, p.47. Retrieved 2-3-09. Includes photos of Smith in pre- production for Flaming Creatures and in Shadows in the City. The most famous of Smith's productions is Flaming Creatures (1963). The film is a satire of Hollywood B movies and tribute to actress Maria Montez, who starred in many such productions. However, authorities considered some scenes to be pornographic. Copies of the movie were confiscated at the premiere and it was subsequently banned (technically, it still is to this day). Despite not being viewable, the movie gained some notoriety when footage was screened during Congressional hearings and right-wing politician Strom Thurmond mentioned it in anti-porn speeches. Smith's next movie Normal Love was the only work in Smith's oeuvre with an almost conventional length (120 mins.), and featured multiple underground stars, including Mario Montez, Diane di Prima, Tiny Tim, Francis Francine, Beverly Grant, John Vaccaro, and others. The rest of his productions consists mainly of short movies, many never screened in a cinema, but featured in performances and constantly re-edited to fit the stage needs (including Normal Love). Apart from appearing in his own work, Smith worked as an actor. He played the lead in Andy Warhol's unfinished film Batman DraculaWatson, Steven (2003), \\"Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties\\" Pantheon Books, pp. 51-54, Ken Jacobs's Blonde Cobra, and appeared in several theater productions by Robert Wilson. He also worked as a photographer and founded the Hyperbole Photographic Studio in New York. In 1962, he released The Beautiful Book, a collection of pictures of New York artists, that was re-published in facsimile by Granary Books in 2001. After his last film, No President (1967), Smith created performance and experimental theatre work until his death on September 25, 1989 from AIDS-related pneumonia. In 1978, Sylv√®re Lotringer conducted a 13-page interview with Smith (with photos) in Columbia University's philosophy department publication of Semiotext(e) called Schizo- Culture: The Event, The Book.Sylv√®re Lotringer & David Morris (Eds), Schizo- Culture: The Event, The Book, Semiotext(e), 1978, re-published in 2013, pp. 192-203 In 1987, Smith was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College. Estate In 1989, New York performance artist Penny Arcade tried to salvage Smith's work from his apartment after his long bout with AIDS and subsequent death. Arcade attempted to preserve the apartment as Smith had transformed it ‚Äì an elaborate stage set for his never-to-be-filmed epic Sinbad in a Rented World ‚Äì as a museum dedicated to Jack Smith and his work. This effort failed. Until recently, Smith's archive was co-managed by Arcade, alongside the film historian J. Hoberman via their corporation, The Plaster Foundation, Inc. Within ten years of Smith's death, the Foundation, operating largely without funding but through donations and good will, was able to restore all of Smith's films, create a major retrospective curated by Edward Leffingwell at PS 1, the Contemporary Arts Museum, now part of MOMA, put his films back into international distribution, and publish several books on Jack Smith and his work. In January 2004, the New York Surrogate Court ordered Hoberman and Arcade to return Smith's archive to his legal heir, estranged, surviving sister Sue Slater. Hoberman and Arcade fought to dismiss Slater's claim, arguing that she abandoned Jack's apartment and its contents; the Plaster Foundation created the archive and took possession of the work only after 14 years of repeated, documented attempts at communication with her. In a six- minute trial, Judge Eve Preminger rejected the Foundation's argument and awarded the archive to Slater. By October 2006, the foundation still refused to surrender Smith's archive to the estate, claiming money owed them for expenses associated with managing the archive‚Äîand hoping Smith's work would be bought by an appropriate public institution that could safeguard his legacy and keep the works in the public eye. According to curator Jerry Tartaglia, the dispute was resolved as of 2008, with the purchase of Smith's estate by the Gladstone Gallery. Legacy Smith was one of the first proponents of the aesthetics which came to be known as 'camp' and 'trash', using no-budget means of production (e.g. using discarded color reversal film stock) to create a visual cosmos heavily influenced by Hollywood kitsch, orientalism and with Flaming Creatures created drag culture as it is currently known. Smith was heavily involved with John Vaccaro, founder of The Playhouse of the Ridiculous, whose disregard for conventional theater practice deeply influenced Smith's ideas about performance art. In turn, Vaccaro was deeply influenced by Smith's aesthetics. It was Vaccaro who introduced Smith to glitter and in 1966 and 1967, Smith created costumes for Vaccaro's Playhouse of The Ridiculous. Smith's style influenced the film work of Andy Warhol as well as the early work of John Waters. While all three were part of the 1960s gay arts movement, Vaccaro and Smith refuted the idea that their sexual orientation was responsible for their art. In 1992, performer Ron Vawter recreated Smith's performance \\"What's Underground about Marshmallows\\" in Roy Cohn/Jack Smith which he presented in a live performance and which was later released as a film directed by Jill Godmilow and produced by Jonathan Demme. Playwright Richard Foreman was influenced by Smith. Tony Conrad produced two CDs from the Jack Smith tape archives subtitled 56 Ludlow Street that were recorded at 56 Ludlow Street between 1962 and 1964.Jack Smith - Les Evening Gowns Damnees - 56 Ludlow Street 1962-1964, Volume I and Jack Smith - Silent Shadows On Cinemaroc Island - 56 Ludlow Street 1962-1964 Volume II Label: Table of the Elements. CDs released in 1997 In 2017, Jerry Tartaglia directed a documentary called Escape from Rented Island: The Lost Paradise of Jack Smith which is a film essay concerning the works of Jack Smith, aimed at the artist's most devoted followers.

Background  Liu Yan was born in 889, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. His father Liu Zhiqian (also known as Liu Qian) was then the prefect of Feng Prefecture (Â∞ÅÂ∑û, in modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong) and was married to a Lady Wei, the niece of Wei Zhou (ÈüãÂÆô), a prior military governor (Jiedushi) of Lingnan East Circuit (Â∂∫ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), which Feng Prefecture belonged to. However, he also secretly had a concubine outside the home, a Lady Duan, and it was to Lady Duan that Liu Yan was born. When Lady Wei found out, she killed Lady Duan, but could not bear to kill the infant Liu Yan, and she took him back home to be raised as her own, as a younger brother to her own sons Liu Yin and Liu Tai (ÂäâÂè∞).Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 58.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 61. As Liu Yan grew up, it was said that he was tall and capable in both horsemanship and archery. After Liu Yin became the commander of the army of the circuit (which had been renamed Qinghai (Ê∏ÖÊµ∑)) by that point under the military governor Li Zhirou the Prince of Xue in 896,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Liu Yan was also given the title of military advisor to Li Zhirou as the Prince of Xue, and his name was changed from Liu Yan to Liu Zhi.  Service under Liu Yin  In 901, Li Zhirou's successor Xu Yanruo died, leaving a recommendation to Emperor Zhaozong that Liu Yin be made acting military governor, and Liu Yin subsequently took that title.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. Liu Zhi continued serving under his brother, and was first recorded to have participated in a campaign in 902, when Lu Guangchou, who controlled the Qian Prefecture (ËôîÂ∑û, in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi) region as Qian's prefect, attacked Qinghai, capturing Shao Prefecture (Èü∂Â∑û, in modern Shaoguan, Guangdong) and giving it to his son Lu Yanchang, and then putting Chao Prefecture (ÊΩÆÂ∑û, in modern Chaozhou, Guangdong) under siege. Liu Yin personally led an army and repelled Lu Guangchou from Chao, and then prepared to attack Shao. Under Liu Zhi's advice (as Liu Zhi believed that a direct attack would not be successful due to the strength of Lu Yanchang's army), he put Shao under siege to try to wear out Lu Yanchang's defense, but the strategy backfired when, due to high water levels on the river, the Qinghai army's food supplies were disrupted. Lu Guangchou then launched a relief army from Qian, repelling Liu Yin from Shao.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. Meanwhile, Emperor Zhaozong commissioned the chancellor Cui Yuan as the new military governor of Qinghai, but Cui, while on the way to Qinghai, heard about popular uprisings in the region and also was worried that Liu Yin would not yield the position to him, and therefore returned to then-capital Luoyang. Subsequently, after Liu Yin bribed the powerful warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), who had the Tang imperial court under his physical control by that point, Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai of Tang commissioned Liu Yin as full military governor in 904.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. Liu Zhi served as Liu Yin's deputy military governor. It was said that at that time, in addition to the continued conflict with Lu Guangchou, substantial portions of the region were controlled by other warlords‚ÄîKh√∫c H·∫°o (Êõ≤È°•) at Jiao Prefecture (‰∫§Â∑û, in modern Hanoi, Vietnam); Liu Shizheng (ÂäâÂ£´Êîø) at Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, in modern Guilin, Guangxi); Ye Guangl√ºe (ËëâÂª£Áï•) at Yong Prefecture (ÈÇïÂ∑û, in modern Nanning, Guangxi); Pang Juzhao (ÈæêÂ∑®Êò≠) at Rong Prefecture (ÂÆπÂ∑û, in modern Yulin, Guangxi); Liu Changlu (ÂäâÊòåÈ≠Ø) at Gao Prefecture (È´òÂ∑û, in modern Maoming, Guangdong); and Liu Qian (ÂäâÊΩú, different person than Liu Zhi's father) at Xin Prefecture (Êñ∞Ê¥≤, in modern Yunfu, Guangdong). In addition, east of the Pearl River, there were some 70 camps of people who did not recognize Liu Yin's authorities. It was said that after Liu Yin entrusted the military matters to Liu Zhi, Liu Zhi gradually had these warlords expelled or forced into submission, such that he became known as the preeminent general in the Lingnan region. One of these campaigns was described as in or around 910 (by which time Liu Yin was a vassal of the new Later Liang, which Zhu had established as its Emperor Taizu, and carried the title of Prince of Nanping or Nanhai), when Liu Zhi attacked Liu Changlu at Gao Prefecture. Liu Changlu repelled his attack, but figured that he would not be able to indefinitely hold out against the Liu brothers, and therefore, along with Pang, offered to submit to Ma Yin the Prince of Chu. Ma sent troops to safely escort Liu Changlu and Pang back to his territory and had his general Yao Yanzhang take up garrison at Rong Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. In 911, Liu Yin grew deathly ill. He submitted a petition recommending Liu Zhi as acting military governor, and died shortly after. Liu Zhi took over the circuit. Shortly after, Later Liang's Emperor Taizu made Liu Zhi full military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. His name was changed back to Liu Yan.  As military governor  It was said that Liu Yan, while serving as military governor, frequently invited members of the intelligentsia who had fled from the Central Plain to serve on his staff, and often made the prefects of the circuit's prefectures, so among the prefects there were no military officers. Meanwhile, also in 911, Lu Guangchou's son and successor Lu Yanchang was assassinated by his officer Li Qiu, who subsequently died and was succeeded by another officer, Li Yantu. As Li Qiu had considered killing Lu Guangchou's chief strategist Tan Quanbo, Tan claimed to be ill and retired from the Qian Prefecture army. Hearing of this, Liu Yan dispatched an army to attack Shao Prefecture and captured it; its prefect Liao Shuang (ÂªñÁàΩ) fled to Chu, allowing Liu Yan to take Shao under his control. Meanwhile, he also again attacked Rong Prefecture. Yao Yanzhang was unable to stand up against his attacks despite being aided by a Chu relief force commanded by Xu Dexun, so Yao took the people and left Rong Prefecture, allowing Liu to take control of the Rong Prefecture region, as well as Gao Prefecture. Hearing of the war between two of his vassals, Later Liang's Emperor Taizu sent a delegation led by the official Wei Jian (ÈüãÊà©) to try to mediate a peace between Ma and Liu. Liu responded by sending a large tribute of gold, silver, rhinoceros horns, ivory, and other assorted jewels and spices, to Emperor Taizu. In late 912, Emperor Taizu was assassinated and succeeded by his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying. In early 913, Zhu Yougui bestowed the honorary title of acting Taifu (Â§™ÂÇÖ, \\"emperor's professor\\") on Liu. He was subsequently defeated in a countercoup led by his brother Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun and committed suicide. Zhu Youzhen, who took the throne and changed his name to Zhu Zhen, then gave Liu the title of not only military governor of Qinghai, but also of Jianwu Circuit (Âª∫Ê≠¶, headquartered at Yong Prefecture), and also created him the Prince of Nanping, a title previously held by Liu Yin. Also in 913, Liu Yan sought a marital alliance with Ma Yin, and Ma agreed. In 915, Liu sent a delegation to Chu's capital Changsha to welcome Ma's Empress Ma daughter as his bride, and Ma sent his brother Ma Cun (È¶¨Â≠ò) to escort her to Qinghai. Meanwhile, Liu was dissatisfied that he was only given the title of Prince of Nanping, while another Later Liang vassal, Qian Liu, carried the greater title of Prince of Wuyue. He made a request to Zhu Zhen that he be created the similarly-honored title of Prince of Nanyue and be given a further title as commander of the circuits. When Zhu Zhen refused, Liu commented:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. Thereafter, Liu stopped sending tributes and emissaries to the Later Liang court. In fall 917, Liu went further and declared himself emperor of a new state of Yue, at his capital of Panyu (which he renamed Xingwang). He posthumously honored his grandfather Liu Anren (ÂäâÂÆâ‰ªÅ), father Liu Qian, and brother Liu Yin as emperors. He commissioned the Later Liang emissaries Zhao Guangyi and Li Yinheng (who were previously detained by Liu Yin), as well as his deputy military governor Yang Dongqian, chancellors.  As emperor of Yue  Also in 917, Liu Yan gave his niece, Liu Hua, the daughter of his brother Liu Yin, whom he had created the Princess Qingyuan, in marriage to Wang Yanjun, a son of his northeastern neighbor Wang Shenzhi the Prince of Min (who remained a Later Liang vassal), to cement a relationship between the two states.The traditional sources indicate that Liu Hua was a daughter of Liu Yan's, not Liu Yin's, but her tombstone indicated that she was Liu Yin's daughter. See Chen Hongjun, The Study and Explanation of the Fujian Discovery of the Tombstone Text of the Deceased Lady Minghui, Lady Liu of Yan, from Pengcheng, of Tang. In 918, after Liu Yan offered sacrifices to heaven and earth and issued a general pardon, he changed the name of his state from Yue to Han (and thus his state became known as Southern Han).  As emperor of Southern Han  = Early reign = In 919, Liu Yan created his wife Lady Ma empress. In 920, at Yang Dongqian's request, Liu Yan established schools and imperial examinations, apparently following the Tang model. He also sent emissaries to Former Shu, seeking friendly relations.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. In 922, there was an incident where Liu Yan, believing in the words of the sorcerer that he needed to leave the capital to avoid a disaster, left Xingwang to visit Meikou (Ê¢ÖÂè£, in modern Meizhou, Guangdong), near the Min border. The Min general Wang Yanmei (Wang Shenzhi's son or nephew) decided to launch a surprise attack on Liu Yan's train, but before Wang Yanmei's forces arrived, Liu Yan received the news and fled Meikou before Min forces could attack. In 924, Liu Yan launched an attack on Min, advancing on the borders of Min's Ting (Ê±ÄÊ¥≤, in modern Longyan, Fujian) and Zhang (Êº≥Â∑û, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) Prefectures. A Min counterattack defeated him, and he fled.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. Meanwhile, in 923, Later Liang had been conquered by its northern rival Jin, whose prince Li Cunxu declared himself the emperor of a new Later Tang (as Emperor Zhuangzong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. When the news reached Liu Yan, Liu Yan became fearful of this powerful new state in the north, and in 925 sent his official He Ci (‰ΩïË©û) to Later Tang to try to seek friendly relations in humble terms (referring to himself as \\"the King of the Great Han\\" rather than emperor while addressing Emperor Zhuangzong as \\"the Emperor of the Great Tang\\") and to find out more about the strength of this new dynasty. After He Ci returned, He Ci reported that Emperor Zhuangzong had become arrogant and excessive and that there was no need to be fearful of him; Liu Yan was pleased, and from this point on no longer sought communications with Later Tang. Later in the year, it was said that a white dragon was discovered in the Han palace. In response, Liu Yan changed his era name to Bailong (\\"white dragon\\") and changed his own name to Gong (Èæî).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. However, later in the year, when foreign monks informed him that the character \\"Gong\\" was not favorable to Southern Han's fortune, he further changed his name to a newly created character (Èæë), showing the character of a dragon (Èæç) over that of heaven (Â§©), pronouncing the newly created character \\"Yan.\\"New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 65. (The Zizhi Tongjian placed this second name change in 941.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282.) Also in 925, when Zheng Min (ÈÑ≠Êóª) the emperor of Changhe, sent his brother Zheng Zhaochun (ÈÑ≠Êò≠Ê∑≥) to Southern Han to seek a marriage alliance, Liu Yan gave another niece, the Princess Zengcheng, to Zheng Min in marriage. = Middle reign = In 928, a Chu fleet attacked Southern Han and put Feng Prefecture under siege. In response, Liu Yan, believing that Dayou was a phrase from the I Ching that would portend good fortune in battle, changed the era name to Dayou, and also sent the general Su Zhang (ËòáÁ´†) to take a fleet manned with well-trained archers to try to lift the siege on Feng. Su engaged the Chu fleet and pretended to withdraw after a skirmish, inducing the Chu fleet to chase; he then caught the Chu fleet in an ambush and defeated it, forcing the Chu forces to withdraw.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. In 930, Liu Yan sent his generals Liang Kezhen (Ê¢ÅÂÖãË≤û) and Li Shoufu (ÊùéÂÆàÈÑú) to attack Jiao Prefecture; they captured it and took Khuc Thua My (Êõ≤ÊâøÁæé, son and successor of Khuc Hao) captive, taking (for the time being) Jinghai Circuit (ÈùúÊµ∑, Vietnamese: Tƒ©nh H·∫£i, headquartered at Jiao Prefecture) under Southern Han control and ending the control of the circuit by the Kh√∫c family. Liang further advanced to Champa and pillaged it of its treasure. Liu stationed his general Li Jin (ÊùéÈÄ≤) at Jiao Prefecture to defend it.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. The Southern Han hold on Jinghai would not last long, however. After the fall of the Kh√∫cs, D∆∞∆°ng ƒê√¨nh Ngh·ªá the prefect of Ai Prefecture (ÊÑõÂ∑û, Vietnamese: Ai ch√¢u, in modern Thanh H√≥a Province, Vietnam) built up a personal army of 3,000 adoptive sons, wanting to take control of Jinghai. Although Li knew about this, he did nothing as he was receiving regular bribes from D∆∞∆°ng. In 931, Duong put Jiao Prefecture under siege. Liu Yan sent the general Cheng Bao (Á®ãÂØ∂) to try to lift the siege, but before Cheng could get there, the city fell. Li fled back to Xingwang, where Liu put him to death. Cheng tried to recapture Jiao Prefecture, but Yang defeated and killed him in battle. In 932, Liu Yan created his 19 sons as imperial princes.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. In 934, Empress Ma died.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. Also in 934, Liu Yan allowed his then-surviving oldest son Liu Hongdu the Prince of Qin (Liu Hongdu's older brothers Liu Yaoshu and Liu Guitu having died earlier) to form a guard force of his own, but these guard ranks were filled with hoodlums that Liu Hongdu was close to. When Yang Dongqian tried to speak on this matter to advise Liu Yan to curb Liu Hongdu's activities, as Liu Hongdu was commonly regarded as the heir, Liu Yan refused to listen. When Yang subsequently observed the guards pillage gold and silk from merchants and the merchants' fear causing them not to report the matter, Yang lamented, \\"If the rule is as troubled as this, what is a chancellor for?\\" He thus claimed an illness and retired to his mansion. Liu Yan subsequently never against summoned Yang for any audiences, and Yang eventually died at his home without returning to chancellorship. = Late reign = In 936, Liu Yan sent his general Sun Dewei (Â≠´Âæ∑Â®Å) to attack Chu's Meng (ËíôÂ∑û, in modern Wuzhou, Guangxi) and Gui (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, in modern Guilin, Guangxi). When Chu's prince Ma Xifan (Ma Yin's son) personally went to Gui Prefecture to defend against the attack, Sun withdrew.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. In 937, D∆∞∆°ng ƒê√¨nh Ngh·ªá was killed by his general Ki·ªÅu C√¥ng Ti·ªÖn (ÁüØÂÖ¨Áæ®), who took over Jinghai. In 938, when another former general of Duong's, Ng√¥ Quy·ªÅn (Âê≥Ê¨ä), rose at Ai Prefecture and subsequently attacked Jiao Prefecture, Kieu Cong Tien sought aid from Southern Han. Liu Yan wanted to use this opportunity to take over Jinghai again, so he commissioned his son Liu Hongcao as the military governor of Jinghai and changed his title to Prince of Jiao, having him command an army to head to Jiao Prefecture while Liu Yan himself commanded a follow-up army. By the time that Liu Hongcao was approaching Jiao Prefecture, however, Wu had already defeated and killed Kieu Cong Tien and occupied Jiao Prefecture. When Liu Hongcao prepared to attack, Wu set a trap for him‚Äîsetting large wooden planks covered with iron into the tidal zone, such that when Liu Hongcao attacked at high tide, the planks were invisible, but when the tide fell, the Southern Han ships became stuck on the planks and unable to move. Ngo then counterattacked, killing more than half of the Southern Han soldiers, including Liu Hongcao. Liu Yan, hearing the news, cried bitterly and withdrew his own fleet.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. (This became known as the Battle of B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng River.) In 939, Zhao Guangyi, pointing out that there had not been any emissaries sent between Southern Han and Chu after Empress Ma's death and that the two states, related by marriage, should be friendly to each other, recommended the official Li Shu (ÊùéÁ¥ì) as an appropriate emissary. Liu Yan agreed, and after Li visited Chu, Chu also sent emissaries to Southern Han, reestablishing relations between the two states. Despite this, in 941, Liu Yan sent an emissary to Later Jin's Emperor Gaozu (whose Later Jin state had earlier taken over Later Tang's territory) seeking a military alliance where they would attack Chu and divide its territory; the Later Jin emperor declined. In 942, Liu Yan grew seriously ill. He considered both of his oldest surviving sons, Liu Hongdu and Liu Hongxi the Prince of Jin, to be arrogant and unrestrained, and considered a younger son, Liu Hongchang the Prince of Yue, to be an appropriate successor. He thus considered sending Liu Hongdu and Liu Hongxi out of the capital and making Liu Hongchang his heir. However, the official Xiao Yi (Ëï≠Áõä) persuaded him that bypassing older sons would cause disturbances, and so Liu Yan did not carry out this plan. He soon died, and Liu Hongdu became emperor (as Emperor Shang). The Zizhi Tongjian, summarizing the opinions from other sources, commented about Liu Yan's reign:  Personal information  * Father ** Liu Zhiqian or Liu Qian, posthumously honored Emperor Shengwu with the temple name of Daizu ).Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 58.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 61. * Mother ** Lady Duan, Liu Zhiqian's concubine ).Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 58.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 61. * Wife ** Empress Ma, daughter of Ma Yin, the prince of Chu:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. * Major Concubine ** Consort Zhao, mother of Prince Hongdu, later consort dowager.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 65.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. * Children ** Liu Yaoshu (ÂäâËÄÄÊ®û), the Prince of Yong (created 932), died early ** Liu Guitu (ÂäâÈæúÂúñ), the Prince of Kang (created 932), died early ** Liu Hongdu (ÂäâÂºòÂ∫¶), later renamed Liu Bin, initially the Prince of Bin (created 932), later the Prince of Qin (created 932), later emperor ** Liu Hongxi (ÂäâÂºòÁÜô), later renamed Liu Sheng, the Prince of Jin (created 932), later emperor ** Liu Hongchang (ÂäâÂºòÊòå), the Prince of Yue (created 932, killed by Liu Sheng 944)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. ** Liu Hongbi (ÂäâÂºòÂºº), the Prince of Qi (created 932, killed by Liu Sheng 947)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. ** Liu Hongya (ÂäâÂºòÈõÖ), the Prince of Shao (created 932, killed by Liu Sheng 945)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. ** Liu Hongze (ÂäâÂºòÊæ§), the Prince of Zhen (created 932, killed by Liu Sheng 944)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. ** Liu Hongcao (ÂäâÂºòÊìç), initially the Prince of Wan (created 932), later the Prince of Jiao (created and killed in battle 938).ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞, vol. 5 ** Liu Honggao (ÂäâÂºòÊù≤), the Prince of Xun (born 923, created 932, killed by Liu Sheng 943). ** Liu Hongwei (ÂäâÂºòÊöê), the Prince of En (created 932, killed by Liu Sheng 947)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. ** Liu Hongmiao (ÂäâÂºòÈÇà), the Prince of Gao (created 932, killed by Liu Sheng 954Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 291.

Aircraft and crew The aircraft involved was a 1981-built Boeing 737-244 Advanced, registered OB-1809, which had been leased to TANS Per√∫ from the South African lessor company Safair two months prior to the accident. With manufacturer's serial number 22580 and powered with two Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17A engines, the airframe had its maiden flight on 4 August 1981, and was originally delivered to South African Airways. At the time of the accident the aircraft had accumulated 49,865 flight hours and 45,262 cycles, and was years old. The captain was 45-year-old Octavio Perez Palma Garreta, who had 5,867 flight hours, including 3,763 hours on the Boeing 737. The first officer was 37-year-old Jorge Luis Pinto Panta, who had 4,755 flight hours, with 1,109 of them on the Boeing 737. 38-year-old Gonzalo Chirinos Delgado, a trainee pilot, was also on board. He had 2,700 flight hours, but only 61 of them on the Boeing 737. Description of the accident There was an unusual developing cold front in the vicinity of Pucallpa, minutes before the event took place, with cloud tops estimated to be high. Instead of diverting to another airport, the crew initiated the approach to Pucallpa Airport with torrential rain, hail and strong winds. Some minutes before the scheduled time for landing the aircraft started rocking. Realising that the airport could not be safely reached amid the worsening weather conditions, the pilot attempted an emergency landing. The aircraft was flying through a hailstorm for the last 32 seconds of its ill-fated flight when it was seemingly taken down by a wind shear, hit tree tops, impacted terrain in a swamp located ahead of the runway threshold, broke up as it crash landed and burst into flames, leaving a path of debris and flaming fuel wide and long. The wreckage of the airplane was engulfed by the fire. There were 91 passengers and seven crew members on board; passengers and crew (including all three flight crew) lost their lives in the accident. Non-Peruvian occupants of the aircraft included 11 Americans, one Australian, one Colombian, and one Spaniard; Italians were also aboard, but the actual figures for them depend upon the source. Most of the fatalities were recorded for passengers travelling in the front of the aircraft. Fifty-eight people survived the accident, many of them suffering serious injuries, mostly burns and broken limbs. Investigation Investigation of the crash site was hindered by looters, who descended upon the crash and stole various elements to be sold for scrap. A reward did succeed in securing the return of the flight data recorder. After 312 days of investigations, there were no reports of any technical malfunction. The official cause of the accident was determined to be pilot error for not following standard procedures under adverse weather conditions. The captain took control of the plane, but the trainee pilot did not immediately monitor the instruments; as a result, the crew did not notice the rapid descent in the few crucial seconds they had where they could have avoided danger. According to Aviation Safety Network, the accident ranks among the deadlier ones that took place in 2005. It was also the second major crash involving a TANS Per√∫ airplane in slightly over two years.  In the media  Flight 204 has been the subject of a Reader's Digest story and an MSNBC documentary. The Canadian TV series, Mayday, has also produced an episode about the accident named ‚Ä≥Lack of Vision‚Ä≥.

Ruling from 1161 to 1189 under the regnal name \\"Dading\\", Emperor Shizong's reign was the longest and most stable among the Jin dynasty emperors.Jing-shen Tao, \\"The Jurchen in Twelfth-Century China\\". University of Washington Press, 1976, . Chapter 6. \\"The Jurchen Movement for Revival\\", Pages 69‚Äì83. Early life Wulu was a grandson of Aguda (Emperor Taizu), the founding emperor of the Jin dynasty. His father was Eliduo (Ë®õÈáåÊúµ; also known as Wanyan Zongyao ÂÆåÈ°èÂÆóÂ†Ø), Aguda's third son and a famous general in the early Jin dynasty. As Eliduo died when Wulu was just 12 years old, the latter grew up under the influence of his mother, who had come from a sinicised bohai gentry family from Liaoyang. After her husband's death, Wulu's mother preferred to become a nun instead of remarrying one of her husband's relatives, as was the Jurchen custom. Due to his mother and her relatives, Wulu received a Han Chinese-style education and acquired good knowledge of the Chinese classics. Wulu is said to have also been greatly influenced by the wife he had before becoming emperor. She was from the Wulinda () clan. She advised Wulu to be patient and to pretend to be loyal to his cousin, the emperor Digunai. Digunai admired Lady Wulinda so he summoned her to his inner court in 1151, but she committed suicide. Her death resulted in a deep enmity between Wulu and Digunai. In 1161, when Digunai invaded the Southern Song dynasty to unify China under the Jin dynasty's rule, he also sent agents to assassinate many of his own relatives and thus to cement his power within the imperial clan. Wulu, who was on the hit list, started a rebellion against the emperor. The rebellion was supported by many Jurchen officers and aristocrats who were dissatisfied with Digunai's policy of cultural sinicisation and administrative centralisation, and the human cost of the emperor's southern adventure. The first military officer to support the rebellion was Wanyan Mouyan (). Digunai lost the Battle of Caishi against the Song dynasty and was assassinated by his own disaffected officers. Wulu was able to become the new emperor without having to struggle against Digunai whose title he demoted down to Prince Yang of Hailing. Reign Yan Zi Miao (È°èÂ≠êÂªü) tablet (right) in the Temple of Yan, Qufu, installed in the 24th year of the Dading era (1184) Once on the throne, Wulu ‚Äì who is historically known as Emperor Shizong ‚Äì abandoned his predecessor's plan for invading the Southern Song dynasty, and abolished his domestic sinicisation policies. Although conversant with Han Chinese culture himself, Emperor Shizong thought that the Jurchens' strength was in maintaining their \\"simple and sincere\\", culture, and would often attribute Digunai's defeat to the latter's wholesale abandonment of it. He was not opposed to Chinese culture per se ‚Äì in fact, he once claimed that the \\"natural and honest\\" Jurchen way of life was much like what the ancient Chinese sages taught ‚Äì but he thought that merely reading the Chinese classics without putting their ideas into practice was counterproductive. During Emperor Shizong's reign, he confiscated large areas of unused land and land that had been grabbed by a few large Jurchen landowners, and redistributed it to the Jurchen settlers in northern China. Still, many Jurchens preferred not to work their land plots, but lease them to Han Chinese farmers, and engage in heavy drinking instead. The emperor criticised his people for losing their martial spirit and military skills, such as archery and riding. To give an example to his subjects, Emperor Shizong made hunting an annual royal activity in 1162, and until 1188 he went hunting almost every autumn and winter. He also enjoyed archery and ball games. As part of his promotion of Jurchen culture and the Jurchen language, soon after ascending the throne, Emperor Shizong started a programme of translating Chinese classics into Jurchen. The Jurchen version of the Classic of History was the first to be published; by the end of the Dading era, many other Chinese classics had become available in Jurchen. Early in his reign, Emperor Shizong chose 3,000 Jurchen men to study the Jurchen language. In 1173, the state started offering jinshi degrees in Jurchen, opened the Jurchen Imperial Academy () in the capital and local schools in all the circuits of the empire. It is thought by modern scholars that the purpose of offering the jinshi examinations in Jurchen was more to promote Jurchen scholarship than to recruit more Jurchen for the state service, as most of the Jurchen jinshi degree holders ended up working as teachers of the Jurchen language and of the Chinese classics in Jurchen translation. Emperor Shizong required that, when dealing with Jurchen speakers, government officials respond in Jurchen. In 1174, even the imperial guards were told to learn Jurchen, and not to speak in Chinese; in 1183, one thousand copies of the Jurchen edition of the Classic of Filial Piety were distributed to them for their edification. As one of the ways of restoring Jurchen traditions, Emperor Shizong prohibited servants and slaves from wearing silk, and in 1188 he prohibited Jurchens in general from wearing Han Chinese clothes. Emperor Shizong and his successor, Emperor Zhangzong, were described as believers in both Buddhism and Taoism.Tao (1976), p. 107. In 1187, Emperor Shizong invited Wang Chuyi, a disciple of Wang Chongyang (the founder of the Quanzhen School of Taoism), to preach in his palace. According to some sources, another of Wang Chongyang's disciples, Qiu Chuji, was invited as well. The emperor requested the presence of Wang Chuyi at his deathbed. Modern evaluation Modern scholars feel that Emperor Shizong's efforts to maintain and revive the Jurchen language and culture were not particularly efficacious. The language lacked native literature, and his translations of Chinese works into Jurchen were helping to bring Chinese ideas and values into Jurchens' minds. In fact, the emperor himself once said that the Jurchen language was \\"inferior to Chinese\\", and could not even match Khitan. Outside of the old Jurchen lands in Manchuria, people did not see the utility of speaking the \\"dying\\" and \\"inferior\\" language, and Emperor Shizong himself was wondering if his descendants would criticise him for his attempts to force people use it. Emperor Shizong's attempts to preserve the Jurchens' identity as hunters, too, were conflicting with his drive to improve their livelihood by making them into good farmers. Nonetheless, people generally admired his love of peace, his promotion of learning and care of people's well being; traditionally, his era was called a \\"miniature of Yao and Shun\\", referring to the legendary ancient sage kings.

After receiving this title, Xiao Noujin became arrogant and gave herself the new title of Empress Dowager despite being a former concubine. She was longtime rivals with Xiao Pusage, and spied on Xiao Pusage several times when Zongzhen was a prince. Xiao Noujin tried persuading her son to get rid of Xiao Pusage, but he refused to comply since Xiao Pusage had no children and raised him as a child. When the Emperor was occupied with a hunting trip, Xiao Noujin sent assassins to murder Xiao Pusage. https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%90%A7%E8%8F%A9%E8%90%A8%E5%93%A5 The Emperor's reign was controlled by his mother Xiao Noujin.

She had plans for her younger son Zhongyuan to replace Zongzhen on the throne. Yelu Zhongyuan told his brother, and Xiao Noujin was sent away from the palace. After the Emperor's death, Xiao Noujin reportedly told her daughter-in-law Empress Xiao Dali not to mourn. https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%90%A7%E8%80%A8%E6%96%A4/8106581?fr=aladdin Legacy The Sinified form of his personal name is usually given as the reason (via the Chinese naming taboo) for the variant forms of the Chinese name of the Jurchens around this time. More likely, however, the variants‚Äîwhich are also attested in other languages of the era lacking such a taboo‚Äîsimply reflect dialectical differences among the Jurchens themselves. Emperor Xingzong's reign was the beginning of the end for the Liao dynasty. The government was corrupt and the army started to fall apart. He attacked the Western Xia dynasty many times, and waged war against the Northern Song dynasty. However, the frequent wars were not looked kindly upon by his people, and there were much anger among them for the high taxes. Although Emperor Xingzong was successful in bullying Song into raising the annual indemnities, he was unsuccessful in his invasion of Western Xia due to sandstorms. Emperor Xingzong was interested in Buddhism and spent lavishly for his own pleasure. He died in 1055 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Daozong.

Early life Ryleyev was born in the village of Batovo, now part of Gatchinsky District, Leningrad Oblast. His father, Fyodor Ryleyev, was an impoverished nobleman, a small landowner, who was later employed as the manager of one of Prince Golitsyn's estates. In spite of his family's pecuniary difficulties, Ryleyev was able to study at the Corps des Pages, an elite military academy attended only by members of the nobility, in Saint Petersburg. After his graduation, Ryleyev was awarded a commission in the First Cavalry Company of the First Reserve Artillery Brigade. He participated in the foreign campaigns of 1814 and 1815, seeing action in Poland, Germany and France, during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1818, Ryleyev resigned his commission, and for a time was employed tutoring the children of a wealthy landowner named Tevyashev. A year later he married the landowner's daughter, Natalya Tevyasheva, and went on to father two children. Career He gained recognition in literary circles in 1820, for penning a satirical ode To the Favorite, addressing an unpopular Tsarist official, Alexey Andreyevich Arakcheyev. That same year he joined a Masonic lodge in Saint Petersburg, where he became acquainted with several future members of the Decembrist uprising. In need of a regular income, from 1821 to 1824, Ryleyev worked as an assessor of the Saint Petersburg criminal court. He frequently used his position to aid common men and women in distress. One of those he assisted was twenty-year-old Alexander Nikitenko, an educated Ukrainian serf, working in Saint Petersburg, whom Ryleyev met in a bookstore. Nikitenko had been struggling for some time to obtain emancipation. He explained his dilemma to Ryleyev, who immediately set about convincing several influential cavalry officers, old comrades of his, to campaign for Nikitenko's freedom. Nikitenko's case became something of a cause c√©l√®bre in Saint Petersburg, and the pressure ultimately proved to be too much for Nikitenko's owner, Count Sheremetev, to bear. He granted Nikitenko his freedom on October 11, 1824. Ryleyev did not completely abandon his literary pursuits, however. In 1821, he joined the Free Society of Russian Literature Lovers (–í–æ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ª—é–±–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–µ—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏) ‚Äî an influential association of Russian writers and intellectuals. Ryleyev also edited and co-published a popular annual literary almanac, The Polar Star (–ü–æ–ª—è—Ä–Ω–∞—è –∑–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞), with Alexander Alexandrovich Bestuzhev between 1823 and 1825. The three issues that Ryleyev published contained contributions from many of the foremost Russian authors and poets of the age, among them: Alexander Pushkin, Pyotr Vyazemsky, Vasily Zhukovsky, and Evgeny Baratynsky. He also continued to write poetry during this period. His most well-known poems being Grazhdanskoe muzhestvo (Civic Courage), Grazhdanin (The Citizen), and Ispoved' Nalivaiki (Nalivaiko's Confession). Ryleyev's writing was influenced largely by his compatriots Pushkin, Derzhavin, Gnedich, and the British poet Lord Byron, whose verse and account of the Greek War of Independence served to inspire many Russian intellectuals and artists of Ryleyev's generation. Ryleyev was a minor poet, but his poetry was passionate, and popular at the time it was published. Ryleyev could not support his family with his literary work alone, and after leaving the criminal court, he found employment with the Russian-American Company as a manager in the Saint Petersburg office. Ryleyev the revolutionary In 1823, Ryleyev was recruited by Ivan Pushchin to the revolutionary Northern Society, an organization of reform-minded individuals, mainly veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, dedicated to abolishing serfdom, and replacing the Tsar's government with either a democratic republic or a constitutional monarchy. Ryleyev believed that the revolt was likely to fail and the participants would be executed. Still, he argued that their sacrifice would not be in vain, as the uprising might \\"awaken Russia.\\" As Ryleyev explained prior to the uprising: :An upheaval is essential. The tactics of revolution may be summed up in two words‚Äîto dare. If we come to grief our failure will serve as a lesson to those who come after us. Another Decembrist leader, Pavel Pestel, further elaborated on the motivations of the Society's members: :The desirability of granting freedom to the serfs was considered from the very beginning; for that purpose a majority of the nobility was to be invited in order to petition the Emperor about it. This was later thought of on many occasions, but we soon came to realize that the nobility could not be persuaded...we became even more convinced when the Ukrainian nobility absolutely rejected a similar project [proposed by] their military governor. In his poem, Nalevaiko's Confession, Ryleyev makes veiled allusions to his own willingness to die for the Decembrists' cause: :Say not, thou holy man, again :That this is sin, thy words are vain, :Be it fearful mortal sin :Worse than all crimes that ever have been, :I care not - for could I but see :My native land at liberty, :Could I but see my race restored :To freedom from the foreign horde, :All sins would I upon me take... :Try not with threats my mind to shake, :Persuasive words no change can make... :I know full well the dire fate :Which must upon the patriot wait :Who first dare rise against the foe :And at the tyrant aim the blow. :This is my destined fate - but say :When, when has freedom won her way :Without the blood of martyrs shed, :When none for liberty have bled? :My coming doom I feel and know :And bless the stroke which lays me low :And, father, now with joy I meet :My death, to me such end is sweet. In 1824, Ryleyev was appointed to the directorate of the Northern Society, and was destined to play a key role in the ill-fated uprising. He proved to be an inspirational speaker and talented recruiter. Fellow conspirator, Nikolay Bestuzhev, would later write of Ryleyev: :Physically his appearance was unattractive and he always spoke in a very simple way, but when he touched on his favourite theme--love of his country--his face lit up, his black glowing eyes shone with an unearthly light and his words flowed like a stream of lava. During discussions among the Decembrists regarding what form of government should replace the monarchy, Ryleyev sided with Nikita Muravyev, favoring a government modeled after that of the United States. If the Imperial Family refused to go peacefully into exile, Ryleyev, like Pestel, was willing to support regicide in order to attain the goal of self-governance. Ryleyev's friend, the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, later recounted one Decembrist meeting that he was invited to attend at Ryleyev's apartment in October 1824: :There must have been more than a dozen people in the room, but at first I could not distinguish anything because of the dense blue haze of pipe and cigar smoke. They were sprawling on sofas and on the deep windowsills; young Alexander Odoevsky and (Alexander) Bestuzhev sat cross-legged, Turkish fashion on a Persian carpet... :An intense youth, pale-complexioned, with a prominent forehead, a face like Shelley, lifts a glass - \\"Death to the Tsar.\\" The toast is received with emotion. Ryleev's jet-black eyes light up with an inner flame...Everyone drink's except me, a Pole and a guest...They sing to the death of the Tsar...the rhythmic chant flows through the open windows for all to hear. A glow of a lantern out on the quay suddenly lights up the room. The chant stops abruptly, as fear sobers them up. The shadow of Radishchev in the Fortress crosses my mind. : Ryleev and Ukraine In the early 19th century, Ryleev began working on a poetic novel entitled 'Nalyvaiko', inspired and based upon the leader of a late sixteenth century Cossack uprising in Ukraine. His verses were said to have inspired generations of revolutionaries and academics including Ukrainian exile Mykhailo Drahomanov, who wrote that in the 1850s-\\"The Confession of Nalyvaiko was copied in our secret notebook along with the works of Shevchenko and was read with equal zeal\\". Upon his return to the Russian Empire, his unit was stationed first in Lithuania and then near Ostrogozhsk (Ostrohozk), a city founded by Ukrainian cossacks, where he spent almost three years. There he met his future wife, Natalia Teviashova, who was the daughter of a Cossack officer and came from a noble family. Even after leaving the Russian Imperial Army at the end of 1818 and moving to St Petersburg he would regularly visit Ostrohozhk and the vicinity, to which he always referred to as 'Ukraine'. In December 1825 he wrote to his friend Mykola Markevych: \\"I am a Russian, but I have spent three years in Ukraine: a short time for me, but sufficient to fall in love with that land and its fine inhabitants. Moreover, Ukraine has presented me with an uncommon, incomparable wife. My good Ukrainian lady has now been making me happy for six years, and so my attachment is complemented with the gratitude of my soul\\". Even after moving to St Petersburg, Ryleev did not forget his Ukrainian friends and connections from Ostrohozk and its surrounding vicinity. Ryleev dedicated a poem written in the Summer of 1831 to an old acquaintance, Mikhail Bedraga who had nobly served in the Okhtyrka hussar regiment during the Napoleonic Wars. The poem described a discussion between Ryleev and one of his friends in Ostrohozk surrounding the topic of the Zaporizhian Sich and the rebellion of the Greeks. Ryleev has been noted as being highly inspired by the Ostrogozhsk Cossacks whose descendants he became acquainted with and of having found them as ‚Äúchampions of liberty inherited from their heroic past‚Äù. Ryleev was known to have ransomed individuals out of serfdom, one of those rescued by Ryleev wrote that his grandfather, the first to be indentured was-‚Äútaciturn, humble, and sensible when sober, once he had something to drink..was in the habit of holding forth on public affairs, recalling Cossackdom and the Hetman stae; he was a harsh critic of the corruption of the rural administration‚Äù. The quote alluding to the possible enslavement of individuals for positive recollections of the Hetmenate and criticism of local administration. In 1823, Ryleev wrote a poem surrounding the famed meeting of Tsar Peter I and Hetman Ivan Mazepa at Ostrogozhsk in 1696. Ivan Mazepa famously led the Ukrainian Cossacks in revolt against Peter I and joined forces with King Charles XII of Sweden. Ryleev did not avoid politically contentious topics or areas of history. In 1823 he began crafting yet another poetic novel surrounding Ivan Mazepa, this time the protagonist was his ambitious nephew Andrii Voinarovsky, who joined his uncle's uprisng but on his way to the Ottoman Empire was imprisoned by Russian agents in the SS Peter and Paul Fortress and died in Yakutsk after being in exile for 16 years. His work was criticized for depicting Ivan Mazepa in a favourable light and for allowing him to appear in some scenes of the work as a devoted and ever loyal patriot of his fatherland and willing to sacrifice his life for it. The poetic novel was published in 1924 after numerous omissions were made by the acute censor. During the highly prolific years of 1821‚Äì1823, Ryleev published a composition of numerous poems collectively titled 'Dumy'. Though the publication was said to have been inspired by Polish poet Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and his work Historical Songs of 1816, Ryleev was firm that Niemcwicz was not the primary source of his inspiration-\\"The duma is an ancient inheritance from our southern brethren. The Poles took it from us. To this day the Ukrainians sing dumy about their heroes ‚Äì Doroshenko, Nechai, Sahaidachny, Palii-and the composition of one of them is attributted to Mazepa himself.\\" It is believed that around the year 1824, Ryleev secured access to the Konysky History, \\"a fascinating source on the Cossack past\\". The brief excerpts that were available to him are said to of been the basis of his poem Nalyvaiko, this was rare information during that period. Decembrist revolt On the morning of December 26 (December 14 O.S.), 1825, a group of officers commanding some 3,000 men assembled in Saint Petersburg's Senate Square. They refused to swear allegiance to the new tsar, Nicholas I, instead proclaiming their loyalty to his brother, Grand Duke Constantine, and to the Decembrists' constitution, crying \\"Constantine and Constitution.\\" They expected to be joined by the rest of the troops stationed in Saint Petersburg, but this did not occur. The revolt was further hampered when its nominal leader, Prince Sergei Petrovich Trubetskoy, suffered a last-minute change of heart and chose to hide in the Austrian Embassy during the confrontation. His second-in- command, Colonel Bulatov, was also nowhere to be found. After a hurried consultation, the rebels appointed Prince Evgeny Obolensky as their leader. Ryleyev was heard to remark: :What we foresaw will happen. Our last moments are near, but they are the moments of our liberty. We have lived them and now I willingly forfeit my life. For several long hours there was a standoff between the 3,000 rebels and the 9,000 troops loyal to Nicholas I stationed outside the Senate building, with some desultory shooting from the rebel side. Nearby stood a vast crowd of civilian on-lookers, who began fraternizing with the rebels, but whom the leaders of the revolt did not call upon to participate in the action. Eventually, the new Tsar appeared in person, at the square. He sent Count Mikhail Miloradovich, a hero of the Napoleonic Wars, who enjoyed great popularity with both officers and ordinary soldiers, to parley with the rebels. While delivering a speech encouraging the rebels to surrender, Miloradovich was shot dead by one of the rebels, Peter Kakhovsky. At the same time, a rebelling grenadier squad led by Lieutenant Nikolay Panov, entered the Winter Palace, but failed to seize it and retreated. After spending most of the day in fruitless attempts to parley with the rebel force, the Tsar ordered a cavalry charge. However, the horses slipped on the icy cobbles and the officers retired in disorder. Eventually, as evening neared, the Tsar ordered three artillery regiments to open fire, with devastating effect. To avoid the slaughter the rebels broke and ran. Some attempted to regroup on the frozen surface of the Neva River, to the north of Senate Square. However, here, also, they were targeted by the artillery and suffered many casualties. The cannon fire broke the ice, sweeping away countless dead and dying soldiers into the Neva River. By dusk, that same afternoon, the revolt had been crushed. Arrest and execution On the night of December 27 (December 15 O.S.), 1825, Ryleyev was arrested for his role in the uprising, and charged with treason and attempted regicide. Along with four other Decembrists, judged to be the leaders of the rebellion, Ryleyev was sentenced to be drawn and quartered. The method of execution was changed to hanging after the Tsar refused to confirm the verdict, returning it for further deliberation. During the many interrogations that followed his arrest, Ryleyev, unlike most of his fellow conspirators, never implicated anyone else in the rebellion. Ryleyev then went one step further, pleading with the Investigation Committee in April 1826, to execute him alone for the revolt, stating: If an execution is needed for the good of Russia, I am the only one who deserves it. I have long prayed that it will stop at me, and that the others will be returned by God's mercy to their families, their fatherland, and their noble Tsar. The date of execution was set for July 25 (July 13 O.S.), 1826. When the executioner attempted to hang the five men, three of them, Muravyov-Apostol, Kakhovsky, and Ryleyev, dropped through the trapdoor only to have the rope around their necks break. Ryleyev supposedly told the crowd watching the execution that Russia was an \\"unhappy country, where they don't even know how to hang you.\\" Muravyov-Apostol is said to have made a similar exclamation. However, the most recent hanging in Russia before the Decembrists took place nearly 50 years earlier, so there was no more or less experienced hangman available. The Tsar simply ordered more rope, and the execution was carried out not long after the first attempt. Ryleyev died holding a book of Byron's poetry.

It was built from 1802 to 1828. It is also known as The Rooty Hill and Morreau Reserve. The property is owned by the Presbyterian Church (NSW) Property Trust. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 June 2007.  History  Prior to European settlement the area was occupied by the Dharug people. A significant stone artefact scatter relating to pre-contact Aboriginal use has been identified on the site indicating the potential importance of the site for research. According to oral testimony, the significance of the site for Aboriginal people continued in post contact years as it provided an important unofficial or hidden gathering and camping site for people moving between Sydney Parramatta and the rest of the State. A close examination of the documentation of Governor Phillip's first exploration of Parramatta's western hinterland in April 1788 reveals that the orthodox view that he went only as far as Prospect Hill or a lttle beyond is deeply flawed. His party is much more likely to have traversed Toongabbie, Seven Hills and Blacktown to climb Bungarribee Hill, Doonside and reaching Eastern Creek and Rooty Hill. The hill was named the Rooty Hill by Governor King and was included in one of the four reserves of land for government stock runs. It is most likely that it was named after a hill of similar geological form on Norfolk Island where the Governor had been posted ten years prior to his appointment to New South Wales. In order to build up the colony's stock reserves and as a failsafe against food shortages, Governor King reserved 15,672.72 hectares of land in the Prospect area. This reserve included the Hill and was known as the Rooty Hill Run. There is much speculation about the source of the name Rooty Hill. Mr William Freame wandered much in these parts collecting information from old residents. In 1931 in an article in a country newspaper on place names he wrote regarding the name: \\"Old hands assure me that the hill received its name from the roots and other debris left around its bare fields when the Eastern Creek was in flood, and this appears to be a very reasonable deduction.\\" Mrs Hawkins' description quoted later in the derivation does not appear reasonable. Captain J H Watson's version, he having been in India as a young man, derives the name from \\"ruti\\", the Hindustani word for bread. Governor Macquarie as a young man had also been in India, and if the settlement at the hill had been devoted to agriculture there would have been a connection, but it was a stock yard. A third and anonymous writer puts forward a Captain Thomas Rooty as a resident in the locality. Unfortunately no information can be found on him. The district was used as a government stockyard, and in a lengthy list which Governor Macquarie prepared of the buildings and works erected during his regime between January 1810 and November 1821, we find the following: :\\"At Rooty Hill: :1. a brick built house of two stories high for the residence and accommodation of the superintendent and principal overseer of the Government stock at the station, reserving one room for the use of the Governor, when occasionally there, with kitchen, stables and other necessary out-offices and kitchen garden enclosed; :2. four paddocks of 50 acres, each enclosed for the grazing of young cattle and raising of wheat and maize for the use of the stock men; :3. temporary log huts or barracks for the accommodation of 20 stockkeepers, with small kitchen garden attached thereto. :NB: The station at Rooty Hill is the next principal one to Camden for the grazing of the Government horned cattle and horses, and consists of about 2428 hectares of land of a very superior description, and, as this grazing ground is centrally situated, being on the Great Western Road and only 10 miles distant from Parramatta, it ought not to be on any account alienated from the Crown. Macquarie seems to have forgotten that he had already carved a large slice off the reservation by giving Major Druitt in October 1821 a grant of 404 hectares 'out of the Rooty Hill Government allotment on Ross's Creek'. Mount Druitt is a permanent reminder of this grant. In 1824 Captain P. P. King, son of Governor King, was given a grant of 607 hectares, also part of the Rooty Hill establishment. The \\"brick built house of two stories\\" still stands (1935), with galvanised iron roof (seen in a photo) where once it was shingle-rooved. The oak tree (also shown in a photo) would have been small in Macquarie's time, but is now a veteran, ... a sturdy sample of the genus' (sic). On January 11, 1822 T. H. Hawkins arrived in Sydney with wife and 8 children and mother in law. A few months later he received an appointment as commissariat store keeper at Bathurst, and on April 5 set out from Sydney, at the head of a cavalcade of bullock wagons, carts, drays and belongings over the Blue Mountains to their new home. Late that night the party reached Rooty Hill, a distance of 42 kilometres from Sydney, the Government House was ready to receive them. :...Hawkins described the place \\"I could have been contented to remain there for ever - the house was good, and the land around like a fine wooded park in England\\". (the above paragraphs are all from: Bertie, 1935, p36, 37, with slight modifications/paraphrasing by Read, S., 2006) Under Macquarie's governance the colony's stock farms were expanded and reorganised and were still seen as an important reserve of food for times of shortage and an effective means of wresting the stranglehold on food /meat prices from a \\"cartel of officers and wealthy settlers\\".(Banksia Heritage and Archaeology Oct 2004 In 1813 Macquarie instigated a system of government employed overseers and stock keepers to manage four government stock farms in the colony. He also ordered the construction of farm buildings, enclosures and accommodations. Rooty Hill became the second-most important of the government stock farms and was allocated an overseer's residence with accommodation for the Governor and other visitors. The overseer's cottage was built in 1815 on the northern slopes of The Rooty Hill (now across Eastern Road from The Rooty Hill). This site was possibly chosen as the Hill would have as surely offered protection from the elements. The Rooty Hill remained a part of the stock farm at this stage. An inquiry into the colony's agricultural development in 1822 criticised the expense of the government stock farms and resulted in the reduction of the size of the Rooty Hill farm through grants of land on the perimeter of the reserve. Under Governor Brisbane the Rooty Hill stock farm was reduced further and in 1828 Governor Darling closed the Rooty Hill station giving over ownership of the remaining lands, including the Hill to the Church and Schools Corporation. When the Corporation failed in 1832 the land reverted to government ownership and was leased for grazing until 1865 when 134.87 hectares including The Rooty Hill was sold into the private ownership of Charles McKay. McKay donated a parcel of land on the south west edge of the Hill to the Baptist Church. This was later came into the ownership of the Presbyterian Church which retains ownership to this day. The Hill remained in private ownership from the time of McKay's purchase up until 1975 when the land was resumed by the Planning Department as part of the Eastern Creek Open Space Corridor. In the early 1980s a planting and landscaping project was initiated on the Hill and the sporting fields, Morreau reserve were established. In 1992 ownership of the Hill was given to Blacktown City Council in order to establish an historic park there. The Rooty Hill was grazed right up until the 1960s. It has also had a continuous history of community usage from the 1890s when the then owners, the Angus family sponsored regular community events such as the Queen Victoria's Jubilee celebrations. It has been the site of \\"unofficial community activity\\" - a popular courting spot, a patch of bush for children's adventures, Empire night celebrations. Recently it has become a venue for more official uses such as Council-organised Australia Day celebrations and Carols by Candlelight. The Rooty Hill has had an important function as a meeting place and camping site for post contact Aboriginal people travelling between Penrith and Parramatta. In post-contact years Aboriginal people continued to use Rooty Hill. During the years when Aboriginal movement away from missions and Aboriginal reserves was restricted and closely monitored, Rooty Hill remained an unofficial or hidden gather place and camping site for people moving between Sydney and the Blue Mountains and the rest of the State. One Dharug elder indicated that the \\"South Creek mob\\" and the \\"Toongabbie mob\\" camped at Rooty Hill about three times a year, adding that they were not supposed to be travelling and were meant to stay on the Hargreave Mission at Warwick Farm. The last gathering of this person's family at Rooty Hill was in about 1962 when they met and made a temporary camp in the vegetation at the foot of Rooty Hill. = Modifications and dates = * 1802- reservation of 15672.8 hectares of land including the Rooty Hill for use as a stockrun * 1815 - clearing of the Rooty Hill and surrounds for grazing and cropping * 1865 - 1869 Establishment of Eastern road on the northern slope of the Hill * - donation of a small lot of land on the South West edge to the Baptist Church and subsequent establishment of the Baptist church building * Late 1890s the Rooty Hill is used for community events * 1960s - cessation of grazing on the Hill * Greenspace tree planting and landscape project - sporting field created and called Morreau Reserve  Description  The curtilage includes the Rooty Hill, the Morreau Reserve and the parcel of land owned by the Presbyterian Church facing Rooty Hill Road South. It is bound by Rooty Hill Road South, Church St, Curry Street and Eastern Road . The Rooty Hill is a cleared grassy hill with patches of regrowth Cumberland Plainwoodland to the eastern, southern and south western lower slopes of the hill. It is one of the highest points between Parramatta and the Blue Mountains and its peak affords an expansive view of the Cumberland Plain. The character of The Rooty Hill, as at 1 April 2005, as a grassy topped hill is the result of colonial land clearing and grazing activity during the years it was part of the stock farm and later when owned by the Church and Schools Corporation and then in private ownership (i.e.. 1802 - 1975). The donation of a parcel of land in the south west perimeter of the hill to the Baptist Church in 1890 and consequent cessation of grazing there, led to regrowth of Cumberland Plains Woodlands in that parcel of land. Since the 1960s grazing activity ceased over the whole of the area and there has been some associated regeneration of bushland. While no archaeological investigations have taken place on the Hill , based on its landscape character, land use history and previous regional research, the Rooty Hill has been assessed as having moderate archaeological potential relating to Aboriginal and European artefacts and places.  Heritage listing  The Rooty Hill is of State heritage significance as a remnant of one of the four Government Depots and stock farms first selected by Governor King in 1802 and further developed by Governor Macquarie after 1810. Under Macquarie, Rooty Hill Depot and stock farm developed as the second most important of the stock farms in colonial NSW. It functioned to provide an important reserve food supply for the colony during its establishment when it frequently faced crop failures, drought and other difficulties. The stock farm also enabled the government to control livestock prices and so prevent exploitation of the market by private graziers and contributed to the establishment of colonial breeding herds. An open stone artefact scatter has been located on the site indicating the site's potential as a research resource for Aboriginal history in the area. The hill also has significance to the Aboriginal community as a post contact camping and meeting place for those travelling over the Blue Mountains and into Parramatta and Sydney. Rooty Hill was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 June 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Rooty Hill is of heritage significance at a State level as a remnant of the Rooty Hill Government Depot and stock farm. It was established as the second most important of the stockfarms which were established by Governor King as a reserve for food in times of shortage. Macquarie further developed the stock farm as a place to strengthen and increase the colonial herds and as a mechanism of government intervention to control the supply and price of meat, grain and livestock and market monopolies by wealth property owners and military officers in the early years of the colony. It also represents the history of colonial government intervention in the release of land for settlement and private tenure. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Rooty Hill has historic associations at a State level with Governor King. King named the Hill Rooty Hill and declared the colonial reserve which included the Hill. The later development and history of the Stock farm which included the Rooty Hill is associated with Governor Macquarie,. The Rooty Hill has local heritage significance for its association with several early local families including Dr Charles McKay who through a series of shrewd purchases became a large landowner in the area. His holdings included much of the land between the Western Highway, the Great Western Railway, Rooty Hill Road South and Rupertsworth Road. He was responsible for developing the Minchinbury vineyards. Another important association is with James Angus who purchased many of McKay's holdings and including Rooty Hill and the Minchinbury Estate which he continued to successfully develop. He is credited with establishing the Champagne industry in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Rooty Hill has aesthetic significance at a State level for its landmark qualities. It is one of the highest points between Parramatta, Penrith and the Blue Mountains. Its role as a distinguishing feature of the landscape is demonstrated by the fact that the government reserve of which the Hill was part, was named the Rooty Hill Run. In addition, the Hill and associated overseer's cottage provided a stopping point for colonial travellers on their way to the western areas of the state. The landmark qualities of the Hill were also utilised by local Aboriginal people in post contact years. Groups of Aboriginal people travelling between Penrith and Paramatta used the Hill as a gathering place and camping site. The appearance of the hill as a balded topped peak has remained and provides a strong visual link to its historical function as part of a colonial pastoral grazing run. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Rooty Hill has high local significance as a place of special social associations for the local community. The hill figures in locals' memories as a place of informal recreation and gathering as well as its historic role as a venue for community events which began in the 1890s at the instigation of its then owner, James Angus. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The existence of an Open Stone Artefact Scatter site on the south eastern slopes of the Rooty Hill enhances its State Heritage Significance as a resource for archaeological research and makes it an important resource of technical and archaeological information relating to pre-contact Aboriginal culture. The existence of this site makes it highly likely that further evidence of Aboriginal archaeological resources will be found in investigation. Its close proximity and association with the Government and Stock farm makes it a potential site for European archaeological finds such as artefacts associated with grazing and farming. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Rooty Hill contains regrowth Cumberland Plain Woodland in the Presbyterian church site on the southern perimeter of the Hill. This vegetation is important to the maintenance of the gene pool of local species.

Background Shodhan was a left-handed batsman and occasional medium pace bowler. He was the second Indian batsman, after Lala Amarnath, to score a hundred on Test debut. He was selected against Pakistan on the weight of the 89* that he scored for West Zone against the Pakistanis earlier in the tour. Named as 12th man for the 1952 Calcutta test, he took the field after Vijay Hazare was unable to play. At Calcutta in a curious Indian innings where every batsman reached double figures, Shodhan scored 110 batting at No.8. In an interview Shodhan later reminisced about his hundred: \\"I was an attacking player myself. I relished the attacking field set by Pakistan. Even when the ninth wicket was lost, I managed to hit two consecutive boundaries to reach 100\\". He added 40 runs for the last wicket with Ghulam Ahmed. Shodhan scored 45 and 11 in the first Test at Port of Spain against West Indies that followed. He missed the next three Tests, and when picked for the last match of the series he fell ill. He scored an important 15* in the second innings batting at No.10. That turned out to be his last Test as he was never again selected to play for India. Odd explanation The exclusion of Shodhan from the Indian team thereafter has never been convincingly explained. It is sometimes attributed to the eccentricities of the selectors. In his book The Covers Are Off published in 2004, Rajan Bala interviewed the various people involved, and it seems to indicate that it was the animosity between Shodhan and Vinoo Mankad that ended his career . Mankad, a senior player in the side, was apparently not on good terms with Vijay Hazare who had captained India in the series in West Indies. \\"There was a story doing the rounds that Mankad asked him (Shodhan) as to which side he was on ‚Äì on his or Hazare's. And when Shodhan replied that he was on the Indian side, Mankad had the knives out for him\\". The West Indian tour was to be Hazare's last series and he was succeeded by Mankad. Hazare once told Bala that he was \\"not aware of the exchange between him (Shodhan) and Vinoo, but I must say that Vinoo was not too keen that Deepak play. I suppose Vinoo found Deepak's attitude casual. ... (Shodhan) was not interested in touring (after the final Test of the series) ... Maybe it had to do with his business commitments. He had made himself unavailable for the tour of Pakistan and it might have been because Vinoo was the captain.\\" Shodhan also hinted at the same : \\"All I can tell you is that no youngster could hope to play for long at that time because he had to ally himself to one camp or the other. One had to know how to survive. What did I know about the politics? The captain Vijay Hazare was not a strong personality and the truth is, Vinoo Mankad was. He always had his way... I would have loved to play on. But then Hazare called quits and Mankad became captain. I made myself unavailable for the tour to Pakistan in 1954/55. It is unlikely that I would have been chosen\\". Highest record Deepak Shodhan's 60.33 still remains the highest average in a completed career by an Indian batsman. He represented Gujarat for most of his Ranji career before switching to Baroda. As a youngster, he was a good hockey player. But being a left-hander he needed a specially made 'left-handed hockey stick' which dissuaded him .  Death  Shodhan died at the age of 87 on 16 May 2016 at his Ahmedabad home after suffering from lung cancer, which was detected in February 2016.

It can cause complete crop loss in warm, humid climates, but is virtually unknown in regions with arid summers.‚Äù The name comes from the black fringe that borders growing brown patches on the leaves. The disease also attacks other parts of the plant, ‚Äúall green parts of the vine: the shoots, leaf and fruit stems, tendrils, and fruit. The most damaging effect is to the fruit‚Äù. Grape black rot affects many grape growers throughout the United States, therefore, it is important to understand the disease life cycle and environmental conditions to best manage the disease. Once infection takes place, different methods are available to control the disease. Disease cycle The disease cycle begins with the overwintering structures. The grape black rot pathogen overwinters in many parts of the grape vine, especially mummies and lesions, and is able to overwinter on the vineyard floor. In fact, \\"Viable lesions capable of producing conidia can persist in wood for at least 2 years.\\" Spring rains release the ascospores and conidia contained in the overwintering structures and these spores are ‚Äúspread by wind and rain‚Äêsplash to infect leaves, blossoms and young fruit‚Äù. Some of the mummies on the ground can have a significant discharge of ascospores that begins about two to three weeks after bud breaks and will mature one to two weeks after the start of bloom. In the presence of moisture, these ascospores germinate slowly, taking 36 to 48 hours, but eventually penetrate the young leaves and fruit stems (pedicels). The infections become visible after 8 to 25 days. The period that overwintering spores require to cause infection depends on the inoculum source. If there is a large source of inoculum, the infection will set in earlier. The second type of spore, conidia, ‚Äúare dispersed short distances (inches to feet) by splashing rain drops\\" in rain storms throughout the summer. Infection occurs when either of the two spore types lands on green grape tissue and the tissue remains wet for a \\"sufficient length of time, which is dependent on temperature.\\" For example, at 45¬∞F no infection will occur regardless of moisture, while at 50¬∞F it takes 24 hours of leaf wetness for a spore to germinate and infect the green grape tissue. When a leaf or berry becomes infected, pycnidia form and produce conidia, contributing to repeated cycles of infections in summer rains. At the end of the season, the fungus overwinters as pycnidia or pseudothecia within cane lesions or mummifed fruit. In the spring, the pycnidia will produce conidia once again and the pseudothecia produce ascospores. Environmental conditions for infection When the weather is moist, ascospores are produced and released throughout the entire spring and summer, providing continuous primary infection. The black rot fungus requires warm weather for optimal growth; cool weather slows its growth. A period of two to three days of rain, drizzle, or fog is also required for infection. \\"Conidia spores can also form, within cane lesions or on mummies that have remained within the trellis, and these are dispersed by splashing rain drops.‚Äù Raindrops transfer these spores by moving the spores to different plant parts, especially susceptible young leaves. ‚ÄúIf water is present, the conidia germinate in 10 to 15 hours and penetrate young tissue. New black rot infections continue into late spring and summer during prolonged periods of warm, rainy weather. The conidia are capable of germinating and causing infection several months after being formed. During August, the pycnidia are transformed into an overwintering stage that, in turn, gives rise to pseudothecia within which the spring spores (ascospores) are produced. This ascospore is \\"forcibly discharged into the air and can travel considerable distances.\\" \\"Research has shown that ascospores are an important source of primary infections in the spring.\\" In the spring during wet weather, the \\"pycnidia on infected tissues absorb water and conidia are squeezed out.\\" \\"Conidia are splashed about randomly by rain and can infect any young tissue in less than 12 hours at temperatures between 60-90 degrees.\\" A film of water on the vine surface is necessary for the infection to inoculate. This completes the disease cycle. Symptoms Relatively small, brown circular lesions develop on infected leaves and within a few days tiny black spherical fruiting bodies (pycnidia) protrude from them. Elongated black lesions on the petiole may eventually girdle these organs, causing the affected leaves to wilt. Shoot infection results in large black elliptical lesions. These lesions may contribute to breakage of shoots by wind, or in severe cases, may girdle and kill young shoots altogether. This fungus bides its time. Most plants show very little signs of infection until its too late. They will look very healthy until fruit sets. Even flowering will be normal. Infection of the fruit is the most serious phase of the disease and may result in substantial economic loss. Infected berries first appear light or chocolate brown; it will have a spot that looks very round, like the eye of a bird. That spot will get larger and infect more of the fruit bunch and more of the plant. This creates masses of black pycnidia developing on the surface. Finally, infected berries shrivel and turn into hard black raisin-like bodies that are called mummies. Control and management A mixture of cultural and chemical control practices can manage grape black rot disease caused by Guignardia bidwellii. Cultural control aspects involve the basics in plant care and field sanitation as well as cleanup after an infectious outbreak. Chemical control has a large influence to prevent but not eliminate disease. Cultural control Cultural control consists of the management of the fields and sanitation methods to optimally grow grape crops. Many universities and professors suggest the following cultural control practices: The first cultural control method is to choose the right grape cultivar for the region that the grape will be grown in. Grape cultivars differ in their susceptibility to diseases, including differences in the disease black rot. Some varieties are less susceptible, while others are more prone to the disease when the right environmental conditions occur. Through research, many lists of grapes varieties will show the amount of resistance a variety has to disease and how the variety should be grown. A list of grape varieties is a good place to start for selecting the right grape variety. Proper grape management in the field is important to control black rot disease. The placement of the grape plants is important to provide for proper aeration and lighting. ‚ÄúChoose a planting site where the vines will be exposed to full sun and good air circulation.‚Äù Proper training of grape vines should be practiced. Many people use trellising to keep the vines off the ground. Trellising is a form of plant training, which is the arrangement of plant parts spatially to optimize productivity. Having the grape vines off the ground ‚Äúreduces the time that vines remain wet from dew and rain and thus limits the amount of infection‚Äù. As the current seasons growth occurs, tie the new growth in a spatial manner to allow for air circulation and sunlight to affect the whole grape plant. A proper pruning technique is another cultural control method to limit diseases. Prune each vine every year during the dormant period. This dormant pruning is heavily researched to provide the term-balanced pruning. This is done by using the weight of the previous year‚Äôs cane growth (1- yr-old canes) to determine how many buds should be retained for the current production year. Up to four pounds of pruning can occur during the season. Remove excess growth, diseased and overwintering berries, leaves, and tendrils from the vineyard, and burn or otherwise destroy them. This practice reduces inoculum of the fungus, thus limiting disease. During the season, minor pruning to train the canopy growth may occur to help with aeration. The last cultural control method would be to maintain clean fields once infected. Keep the field well managed, do not allow overgrowth of weeds or plants near the grapes. Once the plants have been infected ‚ÄúRemove all mummies from the canopy during the dormant pruning process. Mummies produce spores next to the susceptible grapevine tissues throughout the season; even relatively few can cause significant damage.‚Äù Another technique to rid of infection can be to ‚Äúcultivate the vineyard before bud-break to bury the mummified berries. Diseased berries covered with soil do not produce spores that will reach the developing vines‚Äù. Chemical control The use of chemical control is widely available for agricultural purposes. To apply chemical applications, look at the fungicide label for proper use. Be sure that the conditions are optimal to spray to avoid drift and inefficiencies of the fungicide due to application. Fungicide guidelines must be followed. There are a wide variety of chemicals that are available for both regular and organic growers. Commercially, application of fungicides may be costly. To cut down on costs, one must understand the life cycle of the pathogens. Different fungicides are more effective at certain infection stages. Understand that throughout the development of the plant, different fungicides should be considered to protect plant health. In order to cut down on spraying costs, it is important to understand life cycle of the pathogen. ‚ÄúResearch in New York demonstrated berries of most varieties become resistant to black rot infection 3-4 weeks after bloom, therefore, sprays for black rot should not be needed at this time‚Äù. Understanding times to limit application is important for good production practices. This shows that preventative chemical measures before the three to four weeks would be optimal. Each region should develop their own fungicide application program in correlation with cultural practices. The most common fungicides that prove to be excellent for certain regions of the United States for controlling black rot are Sovran 50WG, Flint 50WG, Abound Flowable (2.08F), and Pristine 38WDG. Some of these fungicides may only be available for commercial use, however homeowners may go to a hardware store or fungicide distributor for similar fungicides. Sovran 50WG is registered for control of black rot. The Sovran label gives different use rates for control of different diseases. For black rot the rate is 3.2-4.8 oz/A. Sovran is excellent for control of black rot. Flint 50WG is in the same general class of chemistry as Abound and Sovran. It is registered for the control of black rot, powdery mildew and suppression of downy mildew. For black rot the rate is 2.0 oz/A. Abound is in the same general class of chemistry as Sovran and Flint (strobilurin). Abound is recommended at the rate of 11-15.4 fl oz/A. In university tests, the rate of 11-12 fl oz provided good control of the mentioned diseases above. Abound Flowable is very phototoxic to apples of the variety McIntosh or varieties related. Do not allow spray to drift from grapes to apples. Pristine 38WDG contains a combination of two active ingredients (pyraclostrobin, 12.8% and boscalid 25.2%).Pyraclostrobin, a strobilurin, is in the same general class of chemicals as Abound, Sovran, and Flint (strobilurin Pristine is registered for use at the rates of 6-10.5 oz/A. A maximum of six applications may be made per season). The label states, ‚ÄúDo not use on Concord, Worden, Fredonia, or related varieties due to possible foliar injury. Experience in New York suggests that Corot noir and Noiret may also be sensitive to Pristine.‚Äù Black Rot Control for Organic Growers'' Excerpt from Dr. Wayne Wilcox‚Äôs Grape Disease Notes, 2009 suggests a possible way for controlling black rot on grapes in organic farming. Black rot is probably the ‚ÄúAchilles heel‚Äù for organic grape production in the East. In the only good trial that we‚Äôve run with copper, it provided 40% disease control when applied at 2-week intervals, versus essentially 100% control with Nova. To try to avoid this, implement a rigorous program to remove mummies during pruning, and spray copper once a week throughout much of the growing season. This was hard on some of the hybrid vines and runs counter to the thinking of many with a ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù orientation (after all, copper is an element and doesn‚Äôt break down into anything else, so it stays in the soil forever), but it did control the disease in an organically acceptable manner. Limit inoculum within the vineyard. Ideally, this would include removing or burying any mummies that you might encounter at the site. All mummified clusters should be removed from the trellis during pruning and from 2 to 6 weeks after cap fall and prune out any affected clusters before they allow the disease to spread, all the better (spores for disease spread are dispersed by rain primarily within the canopy, so should pose little risk of causing new infections if said clusters are simply dropped to the ground).

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona Diamondbacks, San Diego Padres, Oakland Athletics, New York Mets, Chicago Cubs and Washington Nationals. He bats and throws right-handed. Hairston comes from a noted baseball family, with his grandfather, Sam Hairston, father, Jerry Hairston, Sr., and his brother, Jerry Hairston, Jr. having been Major League players. High school years Hairston attended Canyon del Oro High School in the Tucson suburb of Oro Valley, Arizona and was a letterman in baseball. While there he was a teammate of former second baseman Ian Kinsler. College He played college baseball at Central Arizona College, alongside future major leaguer Ian Kinsler. Professional career =Arizona Diamondbacks= Hairston was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the third round of the 2001 MLB Draft. He started at second base for part of his rookie season of 2004, but has played mostly a reserve role since then. On July 27, 2007, the Diamondbacks traded him to the San Diego Padres for Leo Rosales.Brock, Corey. Padres acquire Hairston from D-backs. MLB.com. July 27, 2007. Retrieved July 30, 2007. San Diego Padres in 2008 =San Diego Padres= During his first game as a San Diego Padres starter (August 3, 2007), Hairston hit two consecutive home runs. The first was a 3-run blast in the 8th inning that pushed the game against the Giants into extra innings and the second was a walk-off blast in the 10th inning. Hairston was placed into the game to substitute for Milton Bradley. The following day in his first at- bat, Hairston hit another home run, making it three home runs in three consecutive at-bats (just the 7th Padre to homer in three straight at-bats). The first game was also the game in which Barry Bonds hit his 755th home run to tie the all-time record previously held by Hank Aaron. Hairston has become a fan favorite in San Diego, well known for his clutch home runs and late- inning heroics. He has hit three walk-off home runs for the Padres, in addition to other walk-off hits. From 2007 to 2009, he hit 12 home runs in late and clutch situations. These are classified as at-bats in the 7th or later with the batting team tied, ahead by one, or the tying run at least on deck. He has been particularly tough against the Giants, with 11 of his 58 career homers coming off San Francisco, as well as 23 RBI, by far the most against any team he's faced. Hairston hit a home run to break a 6‚Äì6 tie in the top of the 13th inning against the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 Wild Card tie- breaker game. The Rockies won the game in the bottom half of that inning. Hairston represented Mexico at the 2009 World Baseball Classic alongside his brother Jerry. Hairston's mother was born in Mexico, making him eligible to play for the Mexican team. =Oakland Athletics= On July 5, 2009, Hairston was traded to the Oakland Athletics for Sean Gallagher and minor leaguers Ryan Webb and Craig Italiano. =Second stint with San Diego Padres= On January 16, 2010, Hairston was traded back to the San Diego Padres, along with outfielder Aaron Cunningham in exchange for third baseman Kevin Kouzmanoff and minor leaguer Eric Sogard. =New York Mets= New York Mets in 2011 On January 20, 2011, Hairston signed a one-year contract with the New York Mets. He resigned with the Mets on January 5, 2012, to a one-year contract worth $1.1 million. On April 27 in Colorado, Hairston became the 10th Met in history to hit for the cycle. On October 3, 2012, Hairston hit his 20th home run (a personal first) of the season off Tom Koehler in the Mets regular season finale against the Miami Marlins. =Chicago Cubs= Hairston became a free agent following the 2012 season. He agreed to a two-year, $5 million contract with the Chicago Cubs in January 2013 with up to $1 million in performance bonuses. The contract became official on February 10, 2013. He began the year in a platoon in right field with Nate Schierholtz and was used as a pinch- hitter when he didn't start. He went 3‚Äì31 with 2 HR in April, 8‚Äì31 with 2 HR in May, and 6‚Äì31 in June and the beginning of July with 4 HR before being traded =Washington Nationals= On July 7, 2013 Hairston was traded to the Washington Nationals for minor league pitcher Ivan Pineyro. Used mostly off the bench in 2013 with Washington, he did start in left field against most left-handed starters, spelling Bryce Harper or Denard Span. He finished July going 2‚Äì17 with 0 HR, went 6‚Äì23 with 1 HR in August, and went 5‚Äì18 with 1 HR in September. In 85 games combined in 2013, he hit .191 with 10 HR and 26 RBI in 157 AB. =Chicago White Sox= On November 18, 2015, Hairston signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox. He was released on March 31, 2016. Family Hairston comes from the biggest Major League Baseball family. He is the brother of Jerry Hairston, Jr., the son of Jerry Hairston, Sr., the nephew of Johnny Hairston, and the grandson of Sammy Hairston, a former Negro Leaguer who later became the first African American player in Chicago White Sox history. The five Hairstons that have played in the majors set a record; in addition, Sam Hairston, Jr spent a year in the minors as part of the Chicago White Sox organization; Johnny Hairston had three sons, Johnny Jr Jeff and Jason who had brief minor league careers. Two other three-generation MLB families have four members each: the Boone family (Ray, Bob, Bret and Aaron) and the Bell family (Gus, Buddy, David, and Mike).

It is located on the campus of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Known to many members in the Upper Valley simply as \\"Hanover,\\" Hanover Country Club was a classic New England 18-hole course that underwent significant renovations in 2001. The course was lengthened to , four new holes were added, and all of the greens were reconstructed. Renovations were made by golf architect Ron Prichard with distinctive Donald Ross-style features; however, the results of the design have been controversial among its members. The 1929 ski jump in the Vale of Tempe that became the symbol of the course was demolished in 1993. The grounds also include \\"Freshmen Hill\\", a popular sledding hill for both locals and students of Dartmouth College. Hanover Country Club is the home course for both the men's and women's golf teams of Dartmouth College. It is also the home of the Hanover High School state champion team. The club has been host to a number of outstanding professionals, including Richard Parker, now also the men's coach at Dartmouth College. Practice area The Hanover Country Club The practice area at Hanover Country Club consists of a short game practice area with green and greenside bunker, four practice holes, and a driving range, the last of which is only opened rarely due to an embedded creek that floods during the rainy months of the summer. The practice area is open to all members, wait-list golfers, students of Dartmouth College, and members of the Hanover High School golf team. The four practice holes are remnants of a nine- hole course designed and constructed in 1932 by Ralph Barton, a Dartmouth graduate. Clubhouse The historic clubhouse at Hanover Country Club reflects a unique New England tradition. Known for its charm and rural feel, it sells a selection of golf equipment and features a recently renovated restaurant. The restaurant's name of \\"Colonel Bogey's\\" refers to the Colonel Bogey March. Art professor Homer Eaton Keyes designed the shingled Arts & Crafts-style clubhouse around 1915 as a remodeling of the club's earlier Golf Barn. The Country Club expects to build a new and less isolated clubhouse closer to Lyme Road in the future. History The club was founded during the 1890s and laid out the first nine holes of the current course, known as Hilton Field, in 1899. Dartmouth acquired the course and added second nine holes during 1920. Remarkable in an age of frequent turnover in the golf industry, Hanover Country Club has had only four head professionals in its history. Until recently, the head professional has also assumed the dual role of serving as the men's coach for the Dartmouth golf team. Tommy Keane and Bill Johnson were the first two head pros, followed by Jason Calhoun, who resigned in 2005. It is now headed by Alex Kirk, who is also the Women's Head Golf Coach.

For example, a communication protocol must know whether some packet comes \\"before\\" or \\"after\\" some other packet. The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) attempts to define \\"Serial Number Arithmetic\\" for the purposes of manipulating and comparing these sequence numbers. This task is rather more complex than it might first appear, because most algorithms use fixed size (binary) representations for sequence numbers. It is often important for the algorithm not to \\"break down\\" when the numbers become so large that they are incremented one last time and \\"wrap\\" around their maximum numeric ranges (go instantly from a large positive number to 0, or a large negative number). Unfortunately, some protocols choose to ignore these issues, and simply use very large integers for their counters, in the hope that the program will be replaced (or they will retire), before the problem occurs (see Y2K). Many communication protocols apply serial number arithmetic to packet sequence numbers in their implementation of a sliding window protocol. Some versions of TCP use protection against wrapped sequence numbers (PAWS). PAWS applies the same serial number arithmetic to packet timestamps, using the timestamp as an extension of the high-order bits of the sequence number. : \\"TCP Extensions for High Performance\\" 4.2 Operations on sequence numbers Only addition of a small positive integer to a sequence number, and comparison of two sequence numbers are discussed. Only unsigned binary implementations are discussed, with an arbitrary size in bits noted throughout the RFC (and below) as \\"SERIAL_BITS\\". =Addition= Adding an integer to a sequence number is simple unsigned integer addition, followed by unsigned Modulo operation to bring the result back into range (usually implicit in the unsigned addition, on most architectures.) s' = (s + n) modulo (2 ^ SERIAL_BITS) Addition of a value outside the range [0 .. (2 ^(SERIAL_BITS - 1) - 1)] is undefined. Basically, adding values beyond this range will cause the resultant sequence number to \\"wrap\\", and (often) result in a number that is considered \\"less than\\" the original sequence number! =Comparison= A means of comparing two sequence numbers i1 and i2 (the unsigned integer representations of sequence numbers s1 and s2) is presented. Equality is defined as simple numeric equality. The algorithm presented for comparison is very complex, having to take into account whether the first sequence number is close to the \\"end\\" of its range of values, and thus a smaller \\"wrapped\\" number may actually be considered \\"greater\\" than the first sequence number. Thus i1 is considered less than i2, only if: (i1 < i2 and i2 - i1 < 2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1)) or (i1 > i2 and i1 - i2 > 2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1)) Likewise, i1 is considered greater than i2, only if: (i1 < i2 and i2 - i1 > 2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1)) or (i1 > i2 and i1 - i2 < 2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1)) Shortfalls The algorithms presented by the RFC have at least one significant shortcoming: there are sequence numbers for which comparison is undefined. Since many algorithms are implemented independently by multiple, independent cooperating parties, it is often impossible to prevent all such situations from occurring. The authors of simply put: While it would be possible to define the test in such a way that the inequality would not have this surprising property, while being defined for all pairs of values, such a definition would be unnecessarily burdensome to implement, and difficult to understand, and would still allow cases where s1 < s2 and (s1 + 1) > (s2 + 1) which is just as non-intuitive. Thus the problem case is left undefined, implementations are free to return either result, or to flag an error, and users must take care not to depend on any particular outcome. Usually this will mean avoiding allowing those particular pairs of numbers to co-exist. Thus, it is often difficult or impossible to avoid all \\"undefined\\" comparisons of sequence numbers. However, a relatively simple solution is available. By mapping the unsigned sequence numbers onto signed Two's complement arithmetic operations, every comparison of any sequence number is defined, and the comparison operation itself is dramatically simplified. All comparisons specified by the RFC retain their original truth values; only the formerly \\"undefined\\" comparisons are affected. General solution The algorithm specifies that, for N-bit sequence numbers, there are 2(N‚àí1)‚àí1 values considered \\"greater than\\", and 2(N‚àí1)‚àí1 considered \\"less than\\". Comparison against the remaining value (exactly 2N‚àí1 distant) is deemed to be \\"undefined\\". Most modern hardware implements signed Two's complement binary arithmetic operations. These operations are fully defined for the entire range of values for any operands they are given‚Äîsince any N-bit binary number can contain 2N distinct values, and since one of them is taken up by the value 0, there are an odd number of spots left for all the non-zero positive and negative numbers. There is simply one more negative number representable than there are positive. For example, a 16-bit 2's complement value may contain numbers ranging from ‚àí32768 to +32767. So, if we simply re-cast sequence numbers as 2's complement integers, and allow there to be one more sequence number considered \\"less than\\" than there are sequence numbers considered \\"greater than\\", we should be able to use simple signed arithmetic comparisons instead of the logically incomplete formula proposed by the RFC. Here are some examples (in 16 bits, again), comparing some random sequence numbers, against the sequence number with the value 0. unsigned binary signed sequence value distance \\\\-------- ------ -------- 32767  0x7fff  32767 1  0x0001  1 0  0x0000  0 65535  0xffff  ‚àí1 65534  0xfffe  ‚àí2 32768  0x8000  ‚àí32768 It is easy to see that the signed interpretation of the sequence numbers are in the correct order, so long as we \\"rotate\\" the sequence number in question so that its 0 matches up with the sequence number we are comparing it against. It turns out that this is simply done, using an unsigned subtraction, and simply interpreting the result as a signed two's complement number. The result is the signed \\"distance\\" between the two sequence numbers. Once again, if i1 and i2 are the unsigned binary representations of the sequence numbers s1 and s2, the distance from s1 to s2 is: distance = (signed)( i1 - i2 ) If distance is 0, the numbers are equal. If it is < 0, then s1 is \\"less than\\" or \\"before\\" s2. Simple, clean and efficient, and fully defined. However, not without surprises. All sequence number arithmetic must deal with \\"wrapping\\" of sequence numbers; the number 2N‚àí1 is equidistant in both directions, in sequence number terms. In our math, they are both considered to be \\"less than\\" each other: distance1 = (signed)(0x8000 - 0x0)  (signed)0x8000  -32768 < 0 distance2 = (signed)(0x0 - 0x8000)  (signed)0x8000  -32768 < 0 This is obviously true for any two sequence numbers with distance of 0x8000 between them. Furthermore, implementing serial number arithmetic using two's complement arithmetic implies serial numbers of a bit-length matching the machine's integer sizes; usually 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit. Implementing 20-bit serial numbers needs shifts (assuming 32-bit ints): distance = (signed)((i1 << 12) - (i2 << 12)) See also * Date windowing *Lollipop sequence numbering *Modular arithmetic References External links * * Category:Domain Name System Category:Serial numbers ","title":"Serial number arithmetic"},{"id":"2524923","text":"Sw√¶fberht of Essex was King of Essex (715‚Äì738).

Benches that have a tail vise and a face vise might have two sets of bench dog holes so that it is possible to clamp in this way from either vise. Bench dogs may be square or round. Round dog holes are easier to make as they are simply drilled into the bench using a suitably sized bit. However round dogs do not provide the best gripping surface. Some woodworkers use round dogs which have been flattened on one side to avoid this issue. Square dog holes may be created using a mortiser or by using a chisel in the same way that a mortise is created. However the most common way to make these holes is to cut a series of dadoes in the edge of one of the boards that will make up the benchtop. When the boards are laminated together to form the benchtop, the dadoes form the square holes that are required. Bench dogs require some form of friction mechanism to prevent them falling through the dog hole when in use. This may be achieved by the installation of a strip of spring steel or wire on the side of the bench dog, or simply by making the bench dog a tight fit in the hole. There are various commercial dogs available which solve this problem in numerous ways.

They are the German twin children of supervillain Baron Strucker of HYDRA and the half-siblings of Werner von Strucker. The two characters appear in The Gifted. Publication history Created by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr., the von Strucker twins first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #194 (June 1985) in their civilian identity and in Uncanny X-Men #200 (December 1985) as Fenris. Fictional character biography Andrea and Andreas are the children of the terrorist organization HYDRA leader Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. While the two were still in their mother's uterus, they were genetically modified which gave them bio-energy powers which they can use when in physical contact with one another (usually when holding hands). Strucker indoctrinated his children in the beliefs of white supremacy, Nazism and the Fourth Reich. In adulthood, the twins became the supervillains known as \\"Fenris\\" and led the Fenris terrorist organization. Like their father, they are white supremacists. The Strucker twins have gone up against Storm when Storm interrupts Andreas' attempted assault on a native woman in Africa. Andrea retaliates for Storm's humiliation of her brother by shooting her in the head and leaving her to die.Uncanny X-Men #196 The Strucker twins despise Magneto for the role in their father's seeming death some years after World War II. They conduct acts of terrorism and finally attack Magneto during the trial in Paris by the International Court of Justice for crimes against humanity.Uncanny X-Men #200 The X-Men foil their assassination attempt, but Fenris manages to escape by allowing themselves to be swept into the old city sewers. The twins later resurface as part of a group of mutant millionaires who engage in a campaign of murder as part of a game organized by the mutant telepath Gamesmaster and the Hellfire Club's former Black Queen Selene. The twins tried to acquire Omega Red for the Upstarts but failed. The twins ultimately met their match when they tried to kill the former New Mutant Wolfsbane. Wolfsbane and the X-Factor team easily beat the twins. The twins joined a conference of powerful criminal leaders who intended to divide up what's left by the fallen Kingpin's empire. Among the members of the conference were Slug, Hammerhead, Tombstone and Werner von Strucker. The twins did not believe Werner was actually their sibling. This, and other arguments, caused the conference to degenerate into a shouting, shooting and blasting match. Fenris attempted to kill Hammerhead but was rescued. Their sibling is soon after killed by their father attending the conference disguised as Werner's assistant. The twins resurfaced, where they were seen working with Baron Strucker.Citizen V mini-series They fight Citizen V (John Watkins III), however, Andrea discovers that Citizen V is actually Helmut Zemo's mind transferred into the real Citizen V's body by Techno after being decapitated by Nomad under Henry Peter Gyrich's orders. Zemo quickly kills Andrea to keep her from telling anyone the truth. Swordsman (middle) and Songbird. Art by Mike Deodato. After Andrea's death, Zemo has the Purple Man brainwash Andreas into taking the \\"Swordsman\\" alias. Purple Man has him flay the skin from Andrea's corpse to incorporate the resulting leather into his sword's hilt, allowing him to channel their shared powers through his sword. Andreas breaks free of Purple Man's control and joins the Thunderbolts. Andreas continues to be a member under the Thunderbolts' new leadership. Teammate and current field leader Moonstone has approached Andreas with a reassurance. If he helps kill Songbird, Moonstone would be able to make a move to usurp the mentally fragile Norman Osborn as the Thunderbolts' director. Thus two factions seem to be forming amongst the Thunderbolts with Andreas and Moonstone on one side while Songbird and Radioactive Man stand on the other. Despite his considerable skill, he has been defeated twice; the first is when Jack Flag hit him with the flat of his own sword, and the second is when Steel Spider threw him through a window and a flat-screen television using a metal limb.New Thunderbolts vol. 2, #114 Under the control of four imprisoned telepaths, Swordsman has taken over the \\"Baron Strucker\\" title and shaved his head in his father's honor. He has gained the loyalty of several guards by paying them well, and ordered them to set off a bomb in the Zeus (the Thunderbolts' carrier) to initiate a lockdown. He declares to one of his guards that Norman will bring him back his sister or everyone in Thunderbolts Mountain will be killed.Thunderbolts #118 After a detachment of guards kill most of his loyal guards, Strucker kills off the remaining attacking guards. He then encounters Venom declaring to eat Strucker. The two fight, and Strucker runs Venom through with his sword, activating his energy powers while the sword is in Venom's body.Thunderbolts #119 Soon afterwards, Osborn snaps from the pressures of running the Thunderbolts, and the Green Goblin brutally attacks Andreas, crucifying him to a wall with small goblin- daggers.Thunderbolts #120 Not long afterward, it is discovered that Andreas used Arnim Zola to make a clone of Andrea von Strucker. Although Andreas has his sister back, he decides to complete his Thunderbolts contract, leaving the group as a free man. In order to protect Andrea's clone while on missions, Andreas skins his arm, giving the flesh to his sister's clone to hold, allowing her to use their shared powers.Thunderbolts #122 Andrea's clone accompanies Andreas and the Thunderbolts during the battle against the Skrulls, and witnesses as Moonstone incapacitates Andreas and attempts to make a deal with the Skrulls.Thunderbolts #123 Andrea's clone then attacks Moonstone. While she is preoccupied with Moonstone, Bullseye kills her from behind. Osborn later convinces Andreas that the Skrulls killed his sister.Thunderbolts #124 Andreas also saves Songbird's life when Bullseye and Venom attempt to kill her on Moonstone's orders.Thunderbolts #127 Andreas later confronts Osborn with the revelation that he was not being offered a slot on Osborn's personal Avengers as well as never planning on fulfilling the vow to resurrect his sister or to give him a full Presidential pardon after his contract ended. During the confrontation, his momentarily insane employer stabs Andreas through the chest, apparently killing him with his own sword, and throwing him out over the mountain.Dark Reign #1 Andrea's clone and Andreas returned to the living and have opened Club Fenris, a supervillain club in Manhattan. When questioned about their demise and subsequent return from the dead, they stated that their father \\"took care of it\\".Illuminati #2 Powers and abilities As a result of genetic engineering with their X-Genes when they were still in utero, Fenris are able to fly and generate energy blasts, but only when they are holding hands. When holding hands, Andreas can generate concussive force blasts while Andrea generates disintegration beams. Swordsman uses various hidden blades; his primary sword blade is sheathed in an adamantium alloy and can shoot a grappling hook-like projectile. His sword's hilt is wrapped with Andrea's skin to release powerful bioelectric blasts of concussive force. Other versions =House of M= Andrea and Andreas were seen assisting their father in a resistance against both mutants and Kree. Both of them end up killed in action.New Thunderbolts #11 =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Marvel version of Andrea von Strucker and Andreas von Strucker are androgynous mutant twins that can generate heat blasts when they touch each other that seek mutant supremacy through economic control as German business tycoons. Co-Presidents of the global investment firm Fenris International, they're deeply involved in corporate crime to \\"end the economic domination of Homo sapiens\\" while masquerading as an honorable investment banking firm with offices in the Empire State Building. It is also shown that they are lovers. They have dealings with Black Tom Cassidy, and have tried to recruit Gambit and Rogue; Rogue rejected the offer and Gambit was already in their employ but rebelled to help Rogue escape. It is revealed that the Fenris twins are behind the recent Sentinel attacks with the creator of the first wave of mutant hunting robots. It has also been revealed that they are tied to the Mutant Liberation Front. As a result of their activities involving the Sentinels and the Mutant Liberation Front, Bishop apparently killed the twins during their battle with Bishop's X-Men team.Ultimate X-Men # 87 In other media =Television= * Fenris is referenced in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes as an Easter egg.

Vatican Bank was an unsuccessful class action suit by Holocaust survivors brought against the Vatican Bank (\\"Institute for the Works of Religion\\" or \\"IOR\\") and the Franciscan Order (\\"Order of Friars Minor\\") filed in San Francisco, California, on November 15, 1999. The case was initially dismissed as a political question by the District Court for the Northern District of California in 2003, but was reinstated in part by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2005. That ruling attracted attention as a precedent at the intersection of the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) and the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). Part of the complaint against the IOR was dismissed in 2007 on the basis of sovereign immunity, and the remainder of the claim against that defendant was dismissed on the ground that the property claim had no nexus to the United States, a decision confirmed in February 2010 by the Ninth Circuit. The case against the Franciscan Order, who by then were the sole defendants, ended in March 2011 when the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment dismissing the claim, and the case was not appealed further. No part of the claim, therefore, ever came to trial and none of the plaintiffs' allegations of fact were ever established in Court. Historical context The Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome in Rome The factual background as alleged in the claim was that Usta≈°e hiding in the Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome (the Croatian Seminary near the Vatican) brought a large amount of looted gold with them and that it was later moved to other Vatican extraterritorial property and/or the Vatican Bank.Phayer, 2008, p. 219. Although this gold would be worth hundreds of thousands of 2008 US dollars, it allegedly constituted only a small percentage of the gold looted during World War II, mostly by the Nazis.Phayer, 2008, p. 208. According to Phayer, \\"top Vatican personnel would have known the whereabouts of the gold\\", but he gives no evidence that they did, nor does he name any. The lawsuit was made possible by a 1997 executive order of U.S. President Bill Clinton that directed all branches of the US government to open their World War II records to scrutiny. The order came in the aftermath of evidence that Swiss banks were destroying evidence of deposit records by Jews. Fourteen European nations, Canada, and Argentina followed suit, but Vatican City did not. Much of the evidence that has come to light since the executive order was not available to the Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary Gold before it disbanded, although Yugoslavia was among the recipients of restitution.Phayer, 2008, p. 214, 217. Arguments =Plaintiffs= The class action was brought on behalf of \\"all Serbs, Jews, and former Soviet Union citizens (and their heirs and beneficiaries), who suffered\\" at the hands of the Usta≈°e. The named plaintiffs claimed to be victims of personal or property crimes committed by the Usta≈°e. Four organizations that represent holocaust survivors or human rights issues were named as plaintiffs. Surviving victims of the Usta≈°e and their next of kin living in California brought a class action suit against the Vatican bank and others in US federal court, Alperin v. Vatican Bank.Phayer, 2008, p. 208. However, the total potential class, if the Court had recognised the claim, would have included \\"over 300,000 former slave and forced laborers, prisoners, concentration camp, and ghetto survivors\\". Causes of action included \\"conversion, unjust enrichment, restitution, the right to an accounting, human rights violations and violations of international law\\". Subject-matter jurisdiction was asserted under federal law, California state law, international law, and common law. According to plaintiffs, defendants \\"accepted, concealed, hypothecated, laundered, retained, converted and profited from assets looted by the Ustasha Regime during April 1941 through May 1945 and deposited in, or converted, concealed, hypothecated, trafficked, credited, pledged, exchanged, laundered or liquidated through, the IOR, and OFM after the demise of the NDH-Independent State of Croatia in May 1945. 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95529, ND CA 2007. Specifically, the Vatican bank was said to have laundered and converted \\"the Usta≈°a treasury, making deposits in Europe and North and South American, [and] distributing the funds to exiled Usta≈°a leaders including Paveliƒá\\".Phayer, 2008, p. 209. Since the case was dismissed at a preliminary stage, these claims were never proved. A principal piece of evidence against the Vatican was to have been the \\"Bigelow dispatch\\", an October 16, 1946 dispatch from Emerson Bigelow in Rome to Harold Glasser, the director of monetary research for the U.S. Treasury Department. Former OSS agent William Gowen also made a deposition as an expert witness that in 1946 Colonel Ivan Babiƒá transported 10 truckloads of gold from Switzerland to the Pontifical College.Phayer, 2008, p. 210. The plaintiffs sought an accounting and restitution of the Usta≈°e Treasury that, according to the US State Department,United States Department of State had allegedly been transferred illicitly to the Vatican, the Franciscan Order and other banks after the end of the war, in order to further the goals of the Usta≈°e regime in exile and fund the Vatican ratline. The principal movers were allegedly Fr. Krunoslav Draganovic, Fr. Dominik Mandic OFM, and the war criminal Ante Paveliƒá. =Defendants= The named defendants included the Vatican Bank, but not Vatican City (as naming the Vatican City State could have caused the suit to be dismissed on the grounds of sovereign immunity). The Ninth Circuit accepted for the purposes of the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' argument that the Vatican City and the Vatican Bank are separate institutions. The other named defendants were the Order of Friars Minor (\\"Franciscans\\"), the Croatian Liberation Movement, as well as \\"other unknown Catholic religious organizations and known and unknown banking institutions from a variety of countries\\". The Vatican Bank and Order of Friars Minor filed separate motions to dismiss. The Vatican's lawyers did not contest the allegation that a large shipment of gold arrived by truck in Rome in 1946, although they did assert that the plaintiffs had \\"put forward conclusory 'facts'\\".Phayer, 2008, p. 217. The defense did argue that there was \\"no evidentiary connection between the losses of the plaintiffs and the gold deposited in the Vatican bank\\".Phayer, 2008, pp. 217-218. The defendants also argued that, under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (Reagan recognized Vatican sovereignty in 1984), they had no obligation to return the looted Usta≈°e gold to Yugoslavia in 1946 because the country was ruled by a hostile Communist regime, saying: > The decision by a sovereign instrumentality to give funds to a foreign anti- > Communist political movement rather than to a Communist regime, at the time > where the Cold War was beginning in earnest in Europe, is not a \\"commercial\\" > act; it is jure imperii, a deeply sovereign act. Finally, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs did not have standing because the Vatican was only a third party to the plaintiff's injury.Phayer, 2008, p. 219. Disposition =First District Court ruling (2003)= The original lawsuit was filed in the District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco in 1999.99-C-4941 (N.D. Cal. filed Nov. 15, 1999). The parties agreed in the district court to limit their initial arguments to the question of whether the case constituted a political question. The district judge dismissed the case in 2003 on the grounds that it constituted a political question.WL 21303209 (N.D. Cal. 2003). In a separate opinion, the district court dismissed the claims against the Croatian Liberation Movement on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction. =First Ninth Circuit appeal (2005)= The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reinstated some of the plaintiffs claims in 2005,410 F.3d 532, 544 (9th Cir. 2005). and the Supreme Court declined in January 2006 to grant certiorari to review that ruling.James Vicini. 2006, January 17. \\"Court won't review Vatican Bank Holocaust suit\\". Reuters.Order of Friars Minor v. Alperin, 126 S. Ct. 1141, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1000, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 774 (U.S., 2006)Istituto per le Opere di Religione v. Alperin, 126 S. Ct. 1160, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1000, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 775 (U.S., 2006). The Ninth Circuit held that the property claims were not political questions, while it agreed that the \\"war objectives claims\\" (including human rights violations, violations of international law, and slave labor) were political questions.Roger P. Alford. 2006. \\"Foreign Relations as a Matter of Interpretation: The Use and Abuse of Charming Betsy\\". 67 Ohio St. L.J. 1339. The Ninth Circuit wrote that because the case \\"touched on foreign relations and potentially controversial political issues, it [was] tempting to jump to the conclusion that such claims are barred by the political question doctrine\\" but that the court should \\"scrutinize each claim individually\\" rather than \\"abdicate the court's Article III responsibility\\".Symeon C. Symeonides. 2005. \\"Choice of Law in the American Courts in 2005: Nineteenth Annual Survey\\". 53 Am. J. Comp. L. 559. The Ninth Circuit also determined that the U.S. government had not yet taken a position on the issue and that it was not the subject of a treaty or executive agreement. The Ninth Circuit distinguished the case from Kadic v. Karadzic because \\"the claims in Kadic focused on the acts of a single individual during a localized conflict rather than asking the court to undertake the complex calculus of assigning fault for actions taken by a foreign regime during the morass of a world war\\". Although the Ninth Circuit allowed the plaintiffs to proceed with their claims of conversion, unjust enrichment, restitution, and an accounting against the Vatican Bank, it agreed to the dismissal of the claims against the Croatian Liberation Movement and the claim that the Vatican Bank supported the Usta≈°e in committing genocide and other war crimes.John R. Crook. 2005. \\"CONTEMPORARY PRACTICE OF THE UNITED STATES RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW: STATE JURISDICTION AND IMMUNITIES: Ninth Circuit Allows Some Claims Alleging Vatican Bank Complicity with World War II Ustasha Regime to Proceed\\". 99 A.J.I.L. 701. The majority opinion was written by Judge M. Margaret McKeown, with Senior Judge Milton Irving Shadur concurring. Judge Stephen S. Trott dissented in part, arguing that the district court had correctly dismissed the case. Trott wrote: \\"What the majority has unintentionally accomplished in embracing this case is nothing less than the wholesale creation of a World Court, an international tribunal with breathtaking and limitless jurisdiction to entertain the World's failures, no matter where they happen, when they happen, to whom they happen, the identity of the wrongdoer, and the sovereignty of one of the parties.\\"Hannah L.

Vatican Bank, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42902 (N.D. Cal., June 15, 2006). On December 27, 2007, Judge Maxine M. Chesney granted the Vatican Bank's motion to dismiss the fourth amended complaint; this effectively ended the case against the Vatican Bank on the basis of sovereign immunity.Alperin v. Vatican Bank, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95529 (N.D. Cal., Dec. 27, 2007). On April 14, 2009, Judge Chesney granted a plaintiff's motion for leave to file a sixth amended complaint no later than May 1, 2009.Alperin v. Vatican Bank, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36270 (N.D. Cal., Apr. 14, 2009). The sixth amended complaint was filed, naming the Franciscan Order as a defendant, and removing the Vatican Bank.http://vaticanbankclaims.com/six.pdf On September 11, 2009, the District court dismissed the case against the Franciscans without prejudice on grounds of lack of federal jurisdiction and denied Plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint on November 13, 2009. Plaintiffs appealed this to the Ninth Circuit on grounds that the Vatican Bank engages in commercial activity in the United States but lost this appeal. =Complaint to European Central Bank (2010)= On July 1, 2010, the Plaintiffs submitted a request that the European Central Bank initiate an investigation of Vatican Bank money laundering and dealing in Nazi gold. They based this on Article 8 of The Monetary Agreement between the European Union and The Vatican City State which forbids Euro issuing entities from money laundering.https://www.scribd.com/doc/33778229/ECB-7-1-10 Legal analysis The initial dismissal of the case on the political question doctrine was an extension of the precedent in Baker v. Carr.369 U.S. 186, 210-11 (1962). According to Prof. Gwynne Skinner, \\"most of the claims arising out of the Holocaust have been dismissed based on this doctrine either because decisions were already made regarding reparations, or because the Allied forces had already made decisions about who would be prosecuted for the various crimes committed during the Holocaust\\".Gwynne Skinner. 2008. \\"Nuremberg's Legacy Continues: The Nuremberg Trials' Influence on Human Rights Litigation in U.S. Courts under the Alien Tort Statute\\". 71 Alb. L. Rev. 321. According to Prof. Hannibal Travis: \\"Initially, U.S. courts dismissed claims by Holocaust survivors on the grounds that international law only gave rise to claims between states and was not self-executing in the absence of implementing legislation in Congress.

A stereotype is a widely held and fixed notion of a specific type of person and is often oversimplified and can be offensive. Stereotypes of people and groups are harmful, especially when they lack factual information. Nursing as a profession has been stereotyped throughout history. The stereotypes given to nursing as well as women in nursing has been well documented. A common misconception is that all nurses are female; this misconception has led to the emergence of another stereotype that male nurses as effeminate. These generalized perceptions of the nursing profession have aided in the misrepresentation of nurses in the media as well as the mischaracterization of nurses in the eyes of the public. The image of a nurse depicted by the media is typically of a female being over-sexualized as well as diminished intellectually. This notion is then portrayed in get-well cards, television, film and books. The over-sexualized nurse is commonly referred to as a naughty nurse and is often seen as a sex symbol or nymphomaniac. Along with these common stereotypes, studies have identified several other popular images used in media such as handmaiden, angel, torturer, homosexual male, alcoholic, buffoon and woman in white. Common stereotypes of nursing and portrayal of these misrepresentations have fueled a discussion on the effects they have on the profession.  History  In the 19th century and early 20th century the image of a nurse was typically that of the angelic and serving female. At this point in time, there was conflict between the idea of nursing as woman's work and as skilled labor requiring immense training. Nursing was initially considered a woman's job because it constituted domestic labor. The American Civil War (1861-1865) has been thought to be a turning point for this stereotype. In the 1860s, middle-class white women volunteered to be aides in the war effort. These women worked in unsanitary and undersupplied conditions within medical facilities. After returning home from the war these women would contend that adequate care required adequate knowledge, and thus formal training (Nursing Training Programs) needed to be implemented. It has been argued that images circulating of white women participating in nursing work in the south on southern plantations take away from the reality of slaves doing most of the everyday tasks pertaining to the health of both slaves and slave owners. However, in both instances the work is being completed by a woman. Post establishment of Nurse Training Programs, concerns became apparent relating to race and socioeconomic class. This concern was in the schools not wanting to besmirch their reputations by teaching poor women or women of color. Black medical and training facilities were established to serve the black community. While women were able to now seek education in nursing as well as jobs, race and class divisions remained. Subsequently nurses began to be portrayed as sexy pin-up versions of what was earlier described in other media, television and books. Images seen in modern and pop culture show still sexualized ideals of nurses while attempting to dismantle the misrepresentation and go against the stereotype. Images today still show a sexualized ideal when the \\"sexy nurse\\" costume comes back every year for Halloween as well as the portrayal on televisions series like Grey's Anatomy.  Nurses as selfless and angelic  The Lady with the Lamp ‚Äî Florence Nightingale at Scutari in 1891 painted by Henrietta Rae The image of a nurse as a ministering angel was promoted in the 19th century in an attempt to counter the then widely popular image of a nurse being depicted as a dissolute drunk. The image of a drunk nurse was exemplified by Dickens' Sarah Gamp. The nurse in this image is depicted as a moral, noble and religious being who was devout like a nun‚Äîchaste and abstemious - as opposed to the resemblance that of a witch. Her skills would be practical and her demeanor would be stoic and obedient. Florence Nightingale also known as The Lady with the Lamp, promoted this image due to the fact that during the Crimean War, she was known to make rounds at night, treating wounds and giving care to soldiers. The angelic image that comes to mind when a woman with a lamp approaches an injured soldier is not far fetched. This is where much or the selfless angelic image of nurses come from. The idea of female nurses attending the British Army fighting in the war was controversial, due to it being thought immoral as well as revolutionary.  Harmful effects  The media has a strong influence on public views, shaping the way the public values and treats professions in healthcare. In the book Saving Lives: Why the Media's Portrayal Nurses Puts Us All At Risk, Sandy Summers and Harry Jacobs discuss the many ill effects of the common stereotypes and how those are presented in today's media. They argue that offensive stereotypes (such as handmaidens) and sexual stereotypes lead media to overlook how important nurses are in healthcare. This in turn generates a lack of respect. Many people do not know what the scope of practice and care of nursing entails, and are thus prone to being misled by stereotypes. The ignorance of and disrespect for nurses' work hinders their ability to do their jobs and puts lives at risk. Stephanie Sauvinet, a nursing professional who advocates for accurate representation of nurses, said that misrepresentations promote distrust and a lack of respect for nurses, who are perceived as 'less-educated': This has impact on the individual pride of the nurse as well. It may lead a nurse to believe he or she is working for physicians rather than with them. It may also discourage nurses from standing their ground or demanding respect and professionalism.  Misrepresentations in the media  Movies and television shows do not accurately portray the job that a nurse does often having nurses be the backdrop for scenes rather than a part of them. Also, having doctors perform nursing tasks which makes them look more and the nurses less competent and thus unneeded. The Center for Nursing Advocacy explains that physicians being presented carrying out such tasks as \\"triage, patient teaching, giving medications, providing psycho-social support, minute-to-minute care of the critically ill, and preventative care such as vaccinations.‚Äù The reality is that nurses are actually advocates for their patients as well as patient educators. They explain different treatments and procedures to their patients as well as protecting their patients interests. The strongest cognitive associations made about nurses in the US are caring, helpful, professional, and dedicated.

Racing career Raced by his owner Leicester Spring and trained by both Ivan Tucker and Fred Hoysted, Rising Fast's blue, gold and black colours soon became familiar on New Zealand race tracks. He was a seasoned five-year-old when he made the sea voyage to Melbourne in 1954 for the spring (Southern Hemisphere) carnival. He was already well known in racing circles when he arrived, but his accomplishment of winning the Spring Grand Slam put him on front pages of newspapers in Australia, New Zealand and internationally. Although many people consider the Melbourne and Caulfield Cup handicaps to be the blue ribbon events of the carnival, racing aficionados generally agree the weight-for-age Cox Plate is the contest that establishes genuine champions. Nowadays, the Melbourne Cup is internationally known and Rising Fast was aiming for his sixth successive win. Race-goers still remember that the nine stone five pounds (59.5 kg) Rising Fast carried to win the cup in 1954, has only been exceeded by Rain Lover who carried nine stone seven pound (60.5 kg) in 1969. Nor has the race been won since by any top weighted horse, wearing number one saddle cloth, until Makybe Diva did so in 2005. Rising Fast finished the 1954 season with wins which included the Turnbull Stakes, Caulfield Stakes, Caulfield Cup, Cox Plate, Melbourne Cup, LKS Mackinnon Stakes and VRC C.B.Fisher Plate during a great spring campaign.No way to treat a lady: Diva defied the attackers, one and all - Max Presnell 23 October 2009 Retrieved 2010-06-15 Rising Fast was ridden in the 1954 events by Melbourne jockey Bill Williamson but when he was seriously injured prior to the Caulfield Cup he was replaced by Arthur Ward. Melbourne jockey Jack Purtell took over for his next races including the Melbourne Cup, but he was replaced by Bill Williamson the following year 1955 he again won the Caulfield Cup, for the second time. He was handicapped with the formidable top weight of ten stone in the 1955 Melbourne Cup. It was a very wet and heavy track, a holdup at the barrier caused a delay of some five minutes, Bill Williamson the jockey decided to remain in the saddle, together with the lead weights making a very heavy burden for Rising Fast. Rising Fast began well, but in the last 200 metres he was jostled offstride by Toporoa ridden by Neville Sellwood and came a close second. The crowd expected jockey Williamson to protest, but owner Leicester Spring philosophically declared it was a racing incident and the protest was not lodged. However, Neville Sellwood, the rider of Toporoa, was subsequently suspended for two months for interfering with the run of Rising Fast. Had Rising Fast won his record would have been two Caulfield Cups, a Cox Plate and two Melbourne Cups, and those wins would have been in successive years.

He was one of the foremost keyboard composers of his day. Life D'Anglebert's father Claude Henry known as AnglebertJean constructed himself a new name, to suggest nobility, using his surname (Henry) as a second given name, and his father's nickname, Anglebert, to suggest land ownership was an affluent shoemaker in Bar-le-Duc. Nothing is known about the composer's early years and musical education. Since he at one time composed a tombeau for Jacques Champion de Chambonni√®res, it is possible that Chambonni√®res was his teacher‚Äîor at any rate a friend for whom D'Anglebert had much respect. The earliest surviving manuscript with D'Anglebert's music dates from 1650‚Äì1659. It also contains music by Louis Couperin and Chambonni√®res, and possibly originated in their immediate circle; thus already by the mid-1650s D'Anglebert must have been closely associated with the most prominent French harpsichordists of the time. The earliest reference to D'Anglebert survives in his marriage contract from 11 October 1659. D'Anglebert married Magdelaine Champagne, sister-in-law of the organist Fran√ßois Roberday. In the contract, he is described as bourgeois de Paris, suggesting that by 1659 he was already well established in Paris. How he left Bar-le-Duc and settled in Paris remains unknown. D'Anglebert's career in Paris must have begun at the Jacobins church in Rue St. Honor√©, where he was still organist in January 1660. In August 1660 he succeeded Henri Dumont as harpsichordist to Philippe I, Duke of Orl√©ans, the King's younger brother. He kept the position until at least 1668, but in the meantime, in 1662, he bought the reversion of the post of harpsichordist from Chambonni√®res, who had been recently disgraced at the court; Chambonni√®res kept the salary, but D'Anglebert assumed the duties. He served as royal harpsichordist until his son Jean-Baptiste-Henry became his reversioner in 1674. After 1679 D'Anglebert served Dauphine Duchess Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria, who died in 1690. D'Anglebert died the following year, on 23 April. His only published work, Pi√®ces de clavecin, appeared just two years before, in 1689. The rest of his music‚Äîmostly harpsichord works, but also five fugues and a quatuor for organ‚Äîsurvives in manuscripts. Works The complete table of ornamnets from d'Anglebert's Pi√®ces de clavecin. D'Anglebert's principal work is a collection of four harpsichord suites published in 1689 in Paris under the title Pi√®ces de clavecin. The volume is dedicated to Marie Anne de Bourbon, a talented amateur harpsichordist who later studied under Fran√ßois Couperin. Apart from its contents, which represents some of the finest achievements of the French harpsichord school (and shows, among other things, D'Anglebert's thorough mastery of counterpoint and his substantial contribution to the genre of unmeasured prelude), Pi√®ces de clavecin is historically important on several other counts. The collection was beautifully engraved with utmost care, which set a new standard for music engraving. Furthermore, D'Anglebert's table of ornaments is the most sophisticated before Couperin's (which only appeared a quarter of a century later, in 1713). It formed the basis of J.S. Bach's own table of ornaments (Bach copied D'Anglebert's table ca. 1710), and provided a model for other composers, including Rameau. Finally, D'Anglebert's original pieces are presented together with his arrangements of Lully's orchestral works. D'Anglebert's arrangements are, once again, some of the finest pieces in that genre, and show him experimenting with texture to achieve an orchestral sonority. Most of D'Anglebert's other pieces survive in two manuscripts, one of which contains, apart from the usual dances, harpsichord arrangements of lute pieces by composers such as Ennemond Gaultier, Denis Gaultier, and Ren√© Mesangeau. They are unique pieces, for no such arrangements by other major French harpsichord composers are known. The second manuscript contains even more experimental pieces by D'Anglebert, in which he tried to invent a tablature-like notation for keyboard music to simplify the notation of style bris√© textures. D'Anglebert's only surviving organ works are five fugues and a quatuor (an old French term for a four-voice contrapuntal organ piece).

View is upriver to the south. The Tygart Valley River ‚Äî also known as the Tygart River ‚Äî is a principal tributary of the Monongahela River, approximately long,U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed August 15, 2011 in east-central West Virginia in the United States. Via the Monongahela and Ohio rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of in the Allegheny Mountains and the unglaciated portion of the Allegheny Plateau. Course The Tygart Valley River rises in the Allegheny Mountains in Pocahontas County and flows generally north-northwestwardly through Randolph, Barbour, Taylor and Marion counties, past the towns of Huttonsville, Mill Creek, Beverly, Elkins, Junior, Belington, Philippi, Arden, and Grafton, to Fairmont, where it joins the West Fork River to form the Monongahela River. (The Tygart is thus the \\"East Fork\\" of the Monongahela.) Downstream of Elkins, the Tygart passes through a gap between Rich Mountain and Laurel Mountain, which are considered to be part of the westernmost ridge of the Allegheny Mountains and the boundary between the Alleghenies and the Allegheny Plateau. Along its course the river collects Leading Creek at Elkins; the Middle Fork River and the Buckhannon River (its largest tributary) in Barbour County; and Sandy Creek and Three Fork Creek in Taylor County. Just upstream of Grafton, the river was impounded by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam in 1938 to form Tygart Lake. Valley Falls State Park is along the river between Grafton and Fairmont. Flow rate At the United States Geological Survey's stream gauge in Philippi, the annual mean flow of the river between 1940 and 2005 was 1,922 ft¬≥/s (54 m¬≥/s). The river's highest flow during the period was estimated at 61,000 ft¬≥/s (1,727 m¬≥/s) on November 5, 1985. The lowest recorded flow was 4.9 ft¬≥/s (0.1 m¬≥/s) on several days in October 1953. At an upstream gauge near the community of Dailey in Randolph County, the annual mean flow of the river between 1915 and 2005 was 358 ft¬≥/s (10 m¬≥/s). The highest recorded flow during the period was 19,900 ft¬≥/s (564 m¬≥/s) on May 17, 1996. Readings of zero were recorded for several months during autumn of the years 1930 and 1953. History The Tygart Valley was first settled by Europeans in 1753 when David Tygart (for whom the valley and river are named) and Robert Files (or Foyle) located (separately) with their families in the vicinity of present-day Beverly. Although there had been no recent history of conflicts between whites and Indians in that immediate area, that summer a party of Indians traveling the Shawnee Trail discovered the Files cabin and killed seven members of the family. One son escaped and alerted the Tygart family, allowing all to escape. No other white settlement was attempted in present Randolph County until 1772. (It has been thought that Tygart was again among those settling then, but this is not certain). The brothers John and Samuel Pringle, who had taken up residence along the Buckhannon tributary of the Tygart (in present Upshur County) in 1761, acted as their contemporary Daniel Boone was doing in Kentucky and guided numerous immigrant settlers into the main valley of the Tygart which at that time abounded in game and fertile bottomlands. Settlers of the 1770s and '80s included the Connelly, Hadden, Jackson, Nelson, Riffle, Stalnaker, Warwick, Westfall, Whiteman and Wilson families. (One settler, John Jackson [1715‚Äì1801] from County Londonderry, Ireland, was great-grandfather to Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson.)

The club was the owner of the South Fork Dam, which failed during an unprecedented period of heavy rains, resulting in the disastrous Johnstown Flood on May 31, 1889. The failure released an estimated 14.3 million tons of water from Lake Conemaugh, wreaking devastation along the valley of South Fork Creek and the Little Conemaugh River as it flowed about a dozen miles downstream to Johnstown, Pennsylvania, at the confluence of the Little Conemaugh and Stonycreek rivers form the Conemaugh River, a tributary of the Allegheny River. It was the worst disaster event in U.S. history at the time, and relief efforts were among the first major actions of Clara Barton and the newly organized American Red Cross, which she had founded and led. The death toll from the 1889 flood was approximately 2,209. Despite some years of claims and litigation, the club and its members were never found to be liable for monetary damages. The corporation was disbanded in 1904, and the real estate assets were sold by the local sheriff at public auction, largely to satisfy a pre-existing mortgage on the large clubhouse. Dam and club history The South Fork Dam was an earthen dam originally built between 1838-1853 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of the Pennsylvania Main Line canal system to be used as a reservoir for the canal basin in Johnstown. It was abandoned by the commonwealth, sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and then sold again to private interests. In 1880, at the suggestion of entrepreneur Benjamin Franklin Ruff, the newly organized club purchased an old dam and abandoned reservoir from Ruff which he had purchased from former Congressman John Reilly. Ruff envisioned a summer retreat in the hills above Johnstown. He promoted this idea to Henry Clay Frick, a friend of his, who was one of the wealthy elite group of powerful men who controlled Pittsburgh's steel, rail and other industries. Lake Conemaugh, which was about two miles (3 km) long, approximately one mile (1.6 km) wide, and 60 feet (18 m) deep near the dam, was named by the new club. The lake had a perimeter of seven miles (11 km) and could hold 14.3 million tons of water. When the water was \\"up\\" in the spring, the lake covered over 400 acres (1.6 km¬≤). The South Fork Dam was 72 feet (22 m) high and 931 feet (284 m) long. Despite being both well-designed and well- built when new, it failed for the first time in 1862, and a history of negligent maintenance and alterations were later believed to have contributed to its failure on May 31, 1889. Between 1881 when the club was opened and 1889, this dam frequently sprang leaks and was patched, mostly with mud and straw. Major flaws regarding the dam Before closing on Ruff's purchase, Congressman Reilly had crucial discharge pipes removed and sold for their value as scrap metal, so there was no practical way to lower the level of water behind the dam should repairs be indicated.Blogspot.com Ruff, while he was not a civil engineer, had a background that included being a railroad tunnel contractor and supervised the repairs to the dam, which did not include a successful resolution of the inability to discharge the water and substantially lower the lake for repair purposes. The five cast iron discharge pipes, each with an inside diameter of two feet, had previously allowed a controlled release of water. When the initial renovation was completed under Ruff's oversight, it became impossible to drain the lake to repair the dam properly, having modified the dam and lake area it to suit its recreational interests. Most significantly, in order to provide a carriageway across the dam, the top was leveled off, lowering it, where it sat above the town of Johnstown, leaving it only a few feet above the water level at its lowest point. To compound the problem, the club owners and managers had erected fish screens across the mouth of the spillway which was intended to keep water from accumulating to the point of straining the dam; the screens became clogged with debris, restricting the outflow of water.\\"How America‚Äôs Most Powerful Men Caused America‚Äôs Deadliest Flood\\" by Erin Blakemore, History.com, Aug 11, 2017. Retrieved July 22, 2019. Daniel Johnson Morrell became a member of the club for the purpose of observing the state of the dam under its stewardship, and campaigned to club officials, especially to Ruff, its founder, regarding the safety of the dam. Morrell insisted on inspections of the dam's breastwork both by his own engineers, (including John Fulton) and by those of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Morrell's warnings went unheeded, and his offer to effect repairs, partially at his own expense, was rejected by club president, Benjamin F. Ruff (who died two years prior to the flood). Morrell joined the Club to further express his concerns.

A torrent of water raced downstream, destroying several towns. When it reached Johnstown, 2,209 people were killed, and there was $17 million ($473 million in 2020 terms) in damage. The disaster became widely known as the Johnstown Flood, and locally known as the \\"Great Flood\\". Rumors of the dam's potential for harm, and its likelihood of bursting, had been circulating for years, and perhaps this contributed to why they were not taken seriously on that fateful day. For whatever reason, at least three warnings sent from South Fork to Johnstown by telegram the day of the disaster went virtually unheeded downstream. When word of the dam's failure was telegraphed from South Fork by Joseph P. Wilson to Robert Pitcairn in Pittsburgh; Frick and other members of the Club gathered to form the Pittsburgh Relief Committee for tangible assistance to the flood victims as well as determining to never speak publicly about the Club or the Flood. This strategy was a success, and club members and attorneys Philander C. Knox and James H. Reed were able to fend off four lawsuits against the Club; Colonel Unger, its president; and against 50 named members. Each case was \\"either settled or discontinued and, as far as is known, no one bringing action profited thereby.\\"\\"The Johnstown Flood\\", by Robert D. Christie, The Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine, Volume 54, Number 2, April 1971. In the years following this tragic event, many people blamed the members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club for the tragedy, as they had originally bought and repaired the dam to turn the area into a holiday retreat in the mountains. However, they failed to properly maintain the dam, and as a result, heavy rainfall on the eve of the disaster meant that the structure was not strong enough to hold the excess water. Despite the evidence to suggest that they were very much to blame, the Club membership was never held legally responsible for the disaster. Knox and Reed successfully argued that the dam's failure was a natural disaster which was an Act of God, and no legal compensation was paid to the survivors of the flood; The perceived injustice aided the acceptance of ‚Äústrict, joint, and several liability,‚Äù so that a ‚Äúnon-negligent defendant could be held liable for damage caused by the unnatural use of land.‚Äù\\"May 31, 1889 CE: Johnstown Flood\\", National Geographic.

The ruins of the Mission are located at . The site chosen for the mission lay on a plateau at an elevation of above sea level, surrounded by an irrigable valley in the Sierra de Ju√°rez, some east of Mission Santo Tom√°s. The location was previously known to the native Paipai as Ha'ketepohol, meaning \\"water that falls loudly\\". Following the precedent of Mission San Pedro M√°rtir, it was the second and last of the Baja California missions to be situated in such mountainous terrain. Today, Santa Catarina is a village of Paipai and Kumeyaay Indians, but virtually nothing remains of the original structures. Archaeological investigations of the mission's traces are in progress. Mission history The potential mission site was identified in 1794 by a military party led by Sergeant Jos√© Manuel Ruiz and accompanied by missionary Tom√°s Valdell√≥n. In 1796 lieutenant Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Arrillaga, a former gobernor (governor) of the Californias, confirmed the suitability of the site. A key factor in the selection of this location was its proximity to the pass of Portezuelo, on a route that led east to the desert and to the Colorado River. The mission was intended as a defensive fort against eastern intruders as well as a center for converting the local Indians to Christianity. Physical construction of the Mission complex began on August 6, 1797. By 1812, the administration of the mission had been turned over to the authorities at Mission San Vicente. Yet in 1824, the mission was home to 600 neophytes, making it the most populous of the Dominican missions in Baja California at that time. From the onset, the missionaries had to deal with the theft of cattle and attacks by the locals. In 1840, hostile raiders struck, killing 16 neophytes and burning the mission. Mexican soldiers launched a punitive expedition, but the mission was not rebuilt. =Accounts of the mission's demise= An account of the destruction of the mission was given by a Santa Catarina Indian: > A year or two after Fray F√©lix left for Guadalupe, one September, when most > of the people were away from Santa Catalina getting pi√±on to the northward > along the eastern slope of the Sierra Juarez, the Keliwa came and burned the > mission. The sacristan and a few old women were there, but they escaped. (A > more authentic version states that sixteen of the neophytes were killed in > the attack.) Nicu√°rr, with 500 of his people, pursued the Keliwa into the > San Pedro M√°rtir Sierra and killed most of them (Meigs 1935:122‚Äì123). Still other accounts maintain that the uprising that destroyed the mission included not only the Kiliwa but also the Paipai, Kumeyaay from La Huerta, and Colorado River groups such as the Quechan and Cocopa as well: > They were without a leader in the attack; all fought like animals. They all > hated the frailes: the Indians died when the frailes came. They hated the > missionaries. (Meigs 1935:123) Thereafter, the Kiliwa renamed Santa Catarina Wa'i√∫-ich√≠u, a combination of the words wa (house), i√∫ (empty), and ich√≠u (burned). = Appropriation by the Mexican Government = Following the Mexican War of Independence, the 1.5 million acres of land owned by the mission was appropriated by the anticlerical Mexican government. In 1855, the Mexican government granted ownership of the lands of the ex-mission of Santa Catarina to General Ricardo Palacio for his patriotic service to the nation. The grant was made on the conditions that 1) Palacio take possession of the land and have it surveyed within three years, 2) build six houses on the property, and 3) that the land would not be sold to a non-citizen or foreign buyer. In 1861 or 1862, General Palacio passed some of the land to a Manual Castro, who in turn sold it to William Denton, which began the land's passage through several foreign hands. In response, the Mexican government nullified the original grant to General Palacio on the grounds that Palacio had not complied with the conditions of the grant. Ownership of the former lands of Mission Santa Catarina continued to be contested as late as 1916. The Mission compound The site of former Misi√≥n Santa Catarina Virgen y M√°rtir. As a defensive measure, the 77 √ó 53 m mission proper was enclosed by a substantial wall. A watchtower was constructed at the northeast corner, and the only access to the compound was a via a single door located at the south corner. Valdell√≥n reported in 1797 that the Santa Catarina capilla (chapel) was constructed of adobe bricks and measured 10 √ó 5 m, and featured a flat roof; it housed a 150 cm tall statue of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The missionary living quarters measured little more than 25 m¬≤, as did the granary. There were also ancillary structures housing three workshops and a women's dormitory, each measuring 5 m square. Additional support buildings were constructed in 1798 and 1799. As agriculture was fundamental for the subsistence of the site, mission industries consisted mainly of the cultivation of wheat and maize, and the raising and trading of cattle, donkeys, goats, horses, mules, and sheep. The nearby rancher√≠as of Agua Caliente, Agua Caliente del Portezuelo, Cerro Colorado, El Portezuelo, El Rinc√≥n, La Ci√©nega, La Huerta, Los Bateques, Poza de Gonz√°lez, San Pablo, and Sangre de Cristo were integrated into the Mission holdings.

It was completed in December 1941, and premiered (as a full-scale production) at the Pasadena Playhouse on February 26, 1947. The play is based on earlier stories written by Williams, including \\"The Swan\\" and most specifically, one of the same title written in October 1936, after he had recovered from a nervous breakdown arising from his experiences working in the relentlessly mechanical world of the large International Shoes factory in St. Louis, Missouri. Unlike that story, the play is optimistic, with elements of romance and fantasy, and a deus ex machina ending. The subtitle of the play (and of the earlier story) is \\"A Prayer for the Wild of Heart That are Kept in Cages\\"; though that phrase conveys the seriousness of the playwright's chosen topic, its treatment, particularly the elements not present in the original story (such as the Mummers play-within-a-play and the swan-on-a-lake scenes), lighten the tone with elements of fantasy. Williams scholar Allean Hale, in his introduction to a 2000 New Directions Publishers edition of the play (), commented on similarities the play shares with the 1923 expressionist play The Adding Machine by Elmer Rice. Both plays show the robotic typing of office workers, both have a scene of divine intervention and another set by a lake, and both make use of generically named characters (Rice's male lead is \\"Mr. Zero\\"; Williams' female lead is \\"Girl\\"; Rice has Messrs. One, Two, Three, etc.; Williams' has Messrs. P, D, Q, T).  Playwright's comments  In \\"Random Observations\\" written as a preface in 1941, Williams noted that the play was \\"written for both the stage and the screen\\" with Burgess Meredith in mind as the protagonist. He acknowledges the play's \\"didactic material\\" as being perhaps inappropriate as the country was preparing to go to war, but he felt his protagonist's problems were \\"universal and everlasting,\\", an assessment that made the play appropriate even during such a trying time. Six years later, in remarks published in the Pasadena Playhouse program notes, Williams commented on the play:  External links  * The Swan, one of the short stories that feed into the play, from The Missouri Review * 21st century premiere of the play on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign * Guardian review of an October 2001 revival performed at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester Category:1941 plays Category:Plays by Tennessee Williams ","title":"Stairs to the Roof"},{"id":"2525075","text":"A zeitgeber is any external or environmental cue that entrains or synchronizes an organism's biological rhythms to the Earth's 24-hour light/dark cycle and 12-month cycle. History The term \\"zeitgeber\\" (, literally \\"time giver\\", i.e., \\"synchronizer\\") was first used by J√ºrgen Aschoff, one of the founders of the field of chronobiology. His work demonstrated the existence of endogenous (internal) biological clocks, which synchronize biological rhythms. In addition, he found that certain exogenous (external) cues, which he called zeitgeber, influence the timing of these internal clocks. Photic and nonphotic zeitgebers * Light (light is a more important zeitgeber than social interactions). * Atmospheric conditions * Medication * Temperature * Social interactions * Exercise * Eating/drinking patterns Circadian rhythms Any biological process in the body that repeats itself over a period of approximately 24 hours and maintains this rhythm in the absence of external stimuli is considered a circadian rhythm. It is believed that the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), or internal pacemaker, is responsible for regulating the body's biological rhythms, influenced by a combination of internal and external cues. To maintain clock-environment synchrony, zeitgebers induce changes in the concentrations of the molecular components of the clock to levels consistent with the appropriate stage in the 24-hour cycle, a process termed entrainment. Early research into circadian rhythms suggested that most people preferred a day closer to 25‚Äì26 hours when isolated from external stimuli like daylight and timekeeping. However, this research was faulty because it failed to shield the participants from artificial light. Although subjects were shielded from time cues (like clocks) and daylight, the researchers were not aware of the phase-delaying effects of indoor electric lights. The subjects were allowed to turn on light when they were awake and to turn it off when they wanted to sleep. Electric light in the evening delayed their circadian phase; these results became well known. More recent research has shown that adults have a built-in day, which averages about 24 hours; indoor lighting does affect circadian rhythms; and most people attain their best-quality sleep during their chronotype-determined sleep periods. A study by Czeisler et al. at Harvard found the range for normal, healthy adults of all ages to be quite narrow: 24 hours and 11 minutes ¬± 16 minutes. The \\"clock\\" resets itself daily to the 24-hour cycle of the Earth's rotation. Biological rhythms, including cycles related to sleep and wakefulness, mood, and cognitive performance, are synchronized with the body's internal circadian clock. The best way to observe the workings of this clock is to experimentally deprive individuals of external cues like light and social interaction and allow the body to experience a \\"free-running\\" environment ‚Äì that is, one in which there are no zeitgebers to influence the body's rhythms. Under these circumstances, the circadian clock alone modulates the body's biological rhythms. Normally however, external cues like light-dark cycles and social interactions also exert an influence on the body's rhythms. These zeitgebers do so by alerting individuals to changes in the likelihood of possible rewards or threats in the environment. For example, humans are more likely to find food and shelter in the daytime and less likely to detect predators in the nighttime, meaning wakefulness tends to be most fruitful during the day and sleep is the safest activity for the nighttime. Therefore, changes in light and darkness influence the body to rise during the day and become fatigued at night. There are many different zeitgebers, and their relative influence on an individual at any given time depends on a number of factors, including the presence and operation of other kinds of zeitgebers. For example, J√ºrgen Aschoff showed that individuals can compensate for the absence of some zeitgebers like natural light by attending to social zeitgebers instead. Specifically, individuals placed in total darkness for four days did not differ on a variety of measures, including body temperature and various psychomotor tasks like time estimation and finger tapping, from individuals placed in an artificial light-dark environment when both groups were given the same strict time schedule. Researchers concluded that social zeitgebers, like meal times and interactions with other people, can entrain biological rhythms in ways similar to those of other common zeitgebers like light. Psychological effects of changes Since the internal clock sets itself using zeitgebers, the loss or disruption of an individual's usual zeitgebers can be very disorienting. When an individual experiences significant changes in zeitgebers, such as being irregularly scheduled for the night shift, those changes can have a variety of negative effects. One example of this phenomenon is jetlag, in which traveling to another time zone causes desynchronization in sleep-wake cycles, appetite, and emotions. Such zeitgeber disruptions can also lead to decreased cognitive performance, negative mood, and in some cases, episodes of mental illness. =Cognitive performance= Researchers have shown that the 24-hour circadian clock also influences cognitive performance in a wide variety of paradigms, including serial search, verbal reasoning, working memory tasks, suppressing wrong answers, and manual dexterity. Performance on these tasks varies over the course of a day, with each type of task having a unique daily rhythm. For example, the best time to perform a working memory task tends to be midday, while immediate memory is best in the morning, and simple processing is ideally performed in the evening. In addition, individual differences among participants can have an effect on daily rhythms in performance. Studies have found that children perform mental math exercises most successfully in the morning,Rutenfranz J, Helbruegge T. 1957. √úber Tageschwankungen der Rechengeschwindigkeit bei 11-j√§hrigen Kindern. Z Kinderheilk. 80:65‚Äì82 but young adults' performance peaks in the evening. This variation in the performance of various tasks is attributable to a number of factors, including relative working memory load, change in strategy, hemispheric dominance, ability to suppress wrong answers, age, level of practice, and morningness-eveningness, many of which fluctuate according to time of day. Based on these findings, researchers conclude that factors that disturb circadian rhythms can also affect cognitive performance. =Mood disorders= Disturbances in zeitgebers can exert a negative influence on emotion and mood as well as cognitive functioning. The disturbance of biological rhythms by zeitgebers is theorized to increase risk for some forms of psychopathology. There is strong evidence that individuals with depression experience irregular biological rhythms, including disrupted sleep-wake cycles, temperature, and cortisol rhythms. These findings support the theory first proposed by Ehlers, Frank, and Kupfer in 1988 that says that stressful life events can lead to depressive episodes by disrupting social and biological rhythms, leading to negative symptoms like sleep disturbance that can trigger depression in vulnerable individuals. Recent work has also demonstrated that interventions like light therapy, sleep deprivation, and some pharmacological antidepressants may be effective in treating depression by reordering these rhythms to their natural state. Such interventions influence an individual's mood, body temperature, cortisol levels, and melatonin production, all of which appear to be irregular in depressed individuals. Social zeitgebers and mood disorders Some researchers have suggested that the disturbances in biological rhythms present in depressed individuals may actually be the result of previous disruptions in social interactions, which serve as cues for those rhythms. This possibility may help to explain the relationship between stressful life events and the development of mood disorders. For example, newly married or cohabiting couples often need to adjust to each other's sleeping rhythms when beginning to share the same bed for the first time. This adjustment can be difficult and may lead to disruptions in sleep quality and quantity, and possibly increase risk for depression as a result. Researchers have attempted to explore the effect life events that disturb social rhythms might have on depressive symptoms in a number of ways. A number of studies have looked at whether the loss of a spouse, a significant negative life event often associated with increased depressive symptoms, might lead to increased depression via disrupted social rhythms. In addition to grief, bereaved spouses may also be dealing with changes in numerous social zeitgebers. For instance, bereaved spouses may suddenly be faced with changes in meal times, responsibilities for additional chores, social expectations, or simply the reality of living day to day without one's usual conversational partner. Taken together, findings from studies on bereaved spouses indicate that when bereavement is associated with changes in social rhythms, depressive symptoms are likely to increase; however, if bereaved individuals are able to maintain social rhythms after the death of their spouse, increased depression is less likely. These findings suggest that social rhythm stability may not be entirely dependent on life events, but rather has some traitlike elements as well, since some individuals may be more likely to maintain social rhythms than others following the occurrence of a significant life event. Recent studies have also found a connection between the disruption of social rhythms and the triggering of manic episodes in bipolar disorder. Differentiating between zeitgeber disturbances that lead to depression and those that lead to manic episodes has proven difficult. However, in both unipolar and bipolar depression, the concept of social zeitgebers as potential risk factors has influenced the development of interventions to address this risk. For bipolar disorder, Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) is meant to regulate and normalize an individual's social rhythms, including meal times, personal relationships, exercise, and social demands. By regulating social rhythms, therapists hope to normalize in turn individuals' biological rhythms. Studies have not found much evidence that IPSRT improves mood, but individuals undergoing IPSRT experience longer periods between bipolar episodes, indicating that normalizing social rhythms may have a preventative effect. Seasonal affective disorder Seasonal affective disorder may occur as a result of deficiencies in zeitgebers (such as light) during the winter months that stimulate the reward activation system, resulting in a depressed mood. Some studies have pointed to the hormone melatonin, which is regulated by circadian rhythms, as a possible mechanism. Because circadian clocks synchronize human sleep-wake cycles to coincide with periods of the day during which reward potential is highestthat is, during the daytimeand recent studies have determined that daily rhythms in reward activation in humans are modulated by circadian clocks as well, external influences on those rhythms may influence an individual's mood.

The story revolves around an unhappily married couple in the late 1950s who both lead separate affairs. The film was Bakshi's first feature-length live-action film, being primarily known as a director of animated films which heavily utilize live- action sequences, such as Fritz the Cat, Heavy Traffic, Wizards, American Pop and The Lord of the Rings. Cool and the Crazy first aired on the cable television network Showtime in 1994 as part of the series Rebel Highway.  Plot  High School sweethearts Michael and Rosy happily marry during the 1950s, both 18. Things go along smoothly until Roslyn gets pregnant, at age 19. The bills pile up and the two grow apart from each other. Roslyn spends most of the time taking care of their child and hanging out with her best friend, Joannie, who is married to a guy named Bobby. Joannie has been cheating on her husband with a man named Frankie. Roslyn is introduced to Frankie's friend, Joey, a bad boy who is also married. Immediately, Roslyn begins an affair with Joey. At first Michael doesn't suspect anything, but when the two girl friends go out at night and come back later and later, it dawns on him that they are both having affairs. Michael works at a design company with Lorraine, who is into the Beat and jazz scenes. One night, he goes out to have an affair with her. The next morning, however, his uptight attitudes causes him to back out of the affair when he learns that he's not her only lover. Eventually Lorraine leaves to go to New York City. At the same time, Roslyn's trying to break off her affair with Joey, but he won't give up that easily. Varied events soon escalate in violence. Joey kidnaps Roslyn, and Michael goes after them, and takes his wife back from him. Michael and Roslyn go their separate ways, and Michael hits the road. Joey, Frankie, and Crazy.

Ralph Bakshi began developing Cool and the Crazy in the late 1960s under the title If I Catch Her, I'll Kill Her. United Artists and Paramount Pictures each paid Bakshi to develop the film in the 1970s, but were unwilling to produce it, as were the studios Bakshi pitched the film to in the 1980s. According to Bakshi, \\"They thought that no one was going to admit that women can‚Äîand do‚Äîcheat on their husbands. They thought it was too hot, which made no sense.\\" In 1993, Lou Arkoff, the son of Samuel Z. Arkoff, approached Bakshi to write and direct a low-budget feature for Showtime's Rebel Highway series. For the third time, Bakshi revisited his screenplay for If I Catch Her, I'll Kill Her, and retitled the film Cool and the Crazy. Other directors whose films appeared on the series included William Friedkin, Joe Dante and Robert Rodriguez. The film took its title from a 1958 exploitation film released by American International Pictures, but its plot bore no relation to the earlier film.  Reception  Variety reviewer Todd Everett wrote \\"the hyperdrive visual sense for which Bakshi's animated features have been noted. Everything in \\"Cool\\" [...] seems to exist in pastels and Bakshi shoots from more odd angles than any director since Sidney J. Furie in his heyday. And the closing sequences ably demonstrate how it's possible to present strong violence without any blood being shed onscreen. Bakshi pulls strong perfs from a cadre of youngish and largely unknown actors\\".

He favored the use of the organ and of prayers in the vernacular, and was instrumental in founding schools along modern lines. Endnote: See L. L√∂w, Gesammelte Schriften, ii, 251. Chorin became a pivotal figure for reformers, although he himself still operated inside a traditional framework. He also interested himself in public affairs‚Äîhe took an active part in the efforts for Jewish emancipation, and was very influential with the state authorities. Early years Chorin was born in Hranice (P≈ôerov District), Moravia, Austria (now in the Czech Republic) in 1766. At the age of fourteen he studied in the yeshivah of Rabbi Jeremiah Mattersdorf in Mattersburg, Austria, and two years later at Prague in the higher Talmudical school of Ezekiel Landau. Here he also learned German. Chorin married on December 26, 1783, and entered commerce; but his business career being unsuccessful, he accepted the post of rabbi at Arad in the spring of 1789, which he occupied till his death. His First Work In 1798, Chorin published his first pamphlet, Imre No'am (◊ê◊û◊®◊ô ◊†◊ï◊¢◊ù Words of Pleasantness), in which he argued that as the sturgeon had scales it was permitted as food according to Scripture. His opinion, although following that of Landau and other authorities, was strongly opposed by Mordecai Benet and his partisans. Rabbi Isaac Krieshaber of P√°ks wrote a refutation, Ma·∏≥·∏≥el No'am (◊û◊ß◊ú ◊†◊ï◊¢◊ù Staff of Pleasantness), which called forth a second pamphlet by Chorin, Shiryon ·∏≤as·∏≥assim (◊©◊®◊ô◊ï◊ü ◊ß◊©◊ß◊©◊ô◊ù Armour of Quills), (Prague, 1799). By his determined opposition to the traditional usages in Hungary, Chorin incurred the hostility of most of his colleagues. In the spring of 1802 he journeyed to the Somogy district. The favorable impression which his sermons made upon his Jewish hearers there induced him to consider himself as the future rabbi of this district, and on the title page of a pamphlet he published he assumed this title. The rich and prominent Moses Lakenbacher, president of the congregation of Nagykanizsa, promised Chorin his influence with his brethren of the district; but when Lakenbacher became aware of the strong opposition of the conservative party against the reformer he soon turned against him. Opposition by the Orthodox At Prague in 1803, Chorin published 'Eme·∏≥ ha- Shaweh (Vale of the Plain), a work divided into three parts. The first and most important part, Rosh Amanah (Head of the Perennial Stream), in which he granted to the spiritual guides of the people authority to modify the traditional laws and adapt them to the requirements of the time, led to much opposition to him. Chorin treats of Maimonides' thirteen articles of faith, and gives evidence of knowledge rare among his Hungarian contemporaries. Next to the Halakha, Chorin also interpreted the Aggadah in a philosophical way. This method he applied in like manner to the Zohar, which he, far from all mysticism, considered as a rich source of speculative knowledge. This view referred only to the theoretic or intuitive, and not the practical, Kabbalah, the belief in which he considered as contradictory to sound reason. At the beginning of this book are printed the approbation of Rabbi Moses M√ºnz and a eulogistic Hebrew poem of Rabbi Moses Kunitz. This work gave great offense to the Orthodox party, which thwarted the publication of a second edition, for which Chorin had prepared many corrections and additions. Benet wrote to the Arad congregation that the book contained heresies and must be burned. The congregation, however, stood by their rabbi; but some of its members sided with Benet, and their leader, a rich man, publicly insulted Chorin while he was preaching. The Arad board now applied to M√ºnz to certify that the book contained no heresies. Having given his approbation to the author, M√ºnz was in a great dilemma, since he was urged by the Orthodox party to condemn Chorin and to inflict upon him an exemplary punishment. He concluded to yield to the insinuations, and on September 1, 1805, he invited two rabbis to come to √ìbuda to form with him a tribunal before which Chorin was summoned. The session of the court was prolonged to the next day, but then M√ºnz failed to appear. Sentence Pronounced Samuel Butschowitz, rabbi of Assod, now pronounced sentence that \\"Chorin must retract the contents of his book. Should he refuse to do so, his beard will be cut off as a penalty for his heretical transgressions.\\" Thereupon Chorin, whom the populace had stoned in the courtyard of the synagogue, declared that he subordinated his views to those of the theologians of his time, and desired that his book be suppressed. The court also decreed a reduction of Chorin's salary, but the board of his congregation indignantly rejected this decree. Chorin appealed to the imperial government which, on June 24, 1806, annulled the judgment and condemned the leader of his adversaries at Arad to pay the expenses of the lawsuit; the same was also to be punished for his scandalous conduct on Shabbat Shuvah, 1804. Chorin declared that he forgave his adversary, and declined his claims for compensation of the expenses. To avoid further trouble, he determined to give up writing. Attitude Toward Reform The Reform movement among the Jews of Hamburg met his hearty approval. In ·∏≤in'at ha-Emet (Zeal for Truth), a paper written on April 7, 1818, and published in the collection Nogah ha-·∫íede·∏≥ (Light of Righteousness), he declared himself in favor of reforms, such as German prayers, the use of the organ, and other liturgical modifications. The principal prayers, the Shema', and the eighteen benedictions, however, should be said in Hebrew, he declared, as this language keeps alive the belief in the restoration of Israel. He also pleaded for opening the temple for daily service. Influenced by M√ºnz, Chorin recalled this writing on February 19, 1819; but a year later he published Dabar be-'Itto (A Word in Its Time), in which he reaffirmed the views expressed in ·∏≤in'at ha-Emet, and pleaded strongly for the right of Reform. A German translation by L√∂b Herzfeld appeared at Vienna. This directed upon him the attention of the progressive party in Austria and in Germany. Michael Lazar Biedermann, a prominent man, proposed the appointment of Chorin at the new temple to be erected at Vienna; but the government being opposed to it, Isaac Noah Mannheimer was elected instead. Consulted by Baden The government of the grand duchy of Baden asked Chorin (on February 3, 1821), through the banker S. Haber, for his opinion about the duties of a rabbi, and about the reforms in the Austrian states. Chorin answered by writing Iggeret Elasaf, or Letter of an African Rabbi to His Colleagues in Europe, which was published by M. I. Landau (Prague, 1826). In it he stated that the Torah comprised religious truths and religious laws, the latter partly applicable only in Palestine, partly obligatory everywhere. These may be temporarily suspended, but not entirely abolished, by a competent authority, such as a synod. Only ordinances and precautionary laws which are of human origin may be abrogated in conformity with the circumstances of the time. As for mere customs and usages (minhagim), the government, after having consulted Jewish men of knowledge, may modify or abolish them; but in no other way may it interfere with religious affairs. Chorin also pleaded for the establishment of consistories, schools, a theological seminary, and for the promotion of agriculture and professions among the Jews. Some of these ideas he carried out in his own congregation, which included a great number of mechanics. He succeeded in founding a school, and introducing liturgical reforms into the synagogue; even an organ was installed at his instance. He permitted the eating of rice and pulse during the days of Passover. To his theory of a synod regulating and modifying Jewish laws and customs, Chorin always adhered. In his Treue Bote (Prague, 1831) he declared himself against the transfer of the Sabbath to Sunday, but expressed the opinion that, considering the requirements of our time, synods might mitigate the severity of the Sabbatical laws, especially in regard to traveling and writing. In another treatise, Hillel, which appeared at Buda in 1835, he interpreted the prophetic promises about the reuniting of Israel to signify the establishing of a supreme religious authority at Jerusalem. Hillel, in the form of a dialogue, and other contributions of his pen were published in the fourth volume of Bikkure ha-'Ittim. In 1819 he wrote Aba·∏≥ Sofer (The Dust of a Writer), published by Landau (Prague, 1828), containing glosses about Yoreh De'ah, Eben ha-'Ezer, the phylacteries, an exposition of Proverbs I.10, et seq., and two riddles. In his Yeled Ze·∏≥unim (Child of Old Age), (Vienna, 1839), partly in Hebrew, partly in German, he again strongly advocated practical reforms in regard to railroad traveling on the Sabbath and on holidays, the abridgment of the seven days of mourning, the use of the organ, etc., and gave a short sketch of his life. His biographer, Leopold L√∂w, wrote an introduction to this work. In consequence of the Damascus affair in 1840, Chorin republished the apology written in 1753 by Sonnenfels, in which the author proves the falsity of the blood accusation. Chorin added an introduction and L√∂w a biographical notice. On July 26, 1844, during the last weeks of his life, he wrote from his sick-bed a declaration expressing his full accord with the Rabbinical Conference of Brunswick, and on August 11 he sent an address to the conference of Hungarian rabbis at P√°ks. He died at Arad, Romania. He took an active part in the efforts for Jewish emancipation, and was very influential with the state authorities. His grandson, Franz Chorin, was a Hungarian deputy.

Fixed action patterns are said to be produced by the innate releasing mechanism, a \\"hard-wired\\" neural network, in response to a sign stimulus or releaser. Once released, a fixed action pattern runs to completion. This term is often associated with Konrad Lorenz, who is the founder of the concept. Lorenz identified six characteristics of fixed action patterns. These characteristics state that fixed action patterns are stereotyped, complex, species-characteristic, released, triggered, and independent of experience. Fixed action patterns have been observed in many species, but most notably in fish and birds. Classic studies by Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen involve male stickleback mating behavior and greylag goose egg-retrieval behavior.Tinebergen, N. (1952). The curious behavior of sticklebacks. Scientific American, 6, 22‚Äì26.Lorenz, K., Tinbergen, N. (1970). Taxis and instinct in egg-rolling response of the greylag goose. Studies in Animal and Human Behavior, 1, 328‚Äì342. Fixed action patterns have been shown to be evolutionarily advantageous, as they increase both fitness and speed. However, as a result of their predictability, they may also be used as a means of exploitation. An example of this exploitation would be brood parasitism. There are 4 exceptions to fixed action pattern rules. These include reduced response threshold, vacuum activity, displacement behavior, and graded response.  Characteristics  There are 6 characteristics of fixed action patterns. Fixed action patterns are said to be stereotyped, complex, species-characteristic, released, triggered, and independent of experience. *Stereotyped: Fixed action patterns occur in rigid, predictable, and highly-structured sequences. *Complex: Fixed action patterns are not a simple reflex. They are a complex pattern of behavior. *Species-characteristic: Fixed action patterns occur in all members of a species of a certain sex and/or a given age when they have attained a specific level of arousal. *Released: Fixed action patterns occur in response to a certain sign stimulus or releaser. *Triggered: Once released, a fixed action pattern continues to completion, even when there are changes in the surrounding environment. *Independent of experience: A fixed action pattern is not learned. This is known as a fixed action pattern is complete upon the very first release. Sign stimulus The term sign stimulus also known as a releaser, is the determining feature of a stimulus that produces a response. Sign stimuli are often found when observing a fixed action pattern (FAP) that is an innate behavior with very little variance in the manner in which the actions are executed. Several examples of sign stimuli can be seen through the observation of animal behavior in their natural environment. Experimenters have gone into these natural environments to better assess the stimuli and determine the key features of them that elicit a fixed action pattern. Scientists have also observed direct exploitation of sign stimuli in nature among different species of birds. Fixed action patterns are released due to certain external stimuli. These stimuli are single or a small group of attributes of an object, not the object as a whole. These attributes may include color, shape, odor, and sound. Exaggerated models of these attributes are called supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus leads to an exaggerated response. Supernormal stimuli are more effective at releasing a response than a natural stimulus. An external stimulus that elicits a fixed action pattern is termed a sign stimulus if the stimuli emanates from the environment. Whereas, a releaser emanates from one's own species. =Supernormal stimuli= When conducting further experiments, scientists came across the idea of supernormal stimuli. Nikolaas Tinbergen found that incubating geese when given the choice between performing the egg-rolling FAP with an egg versus a full- sized volleyball, they chose the volleyball. These supernormal stimuli, although not naturally occurring, gave insight into the process of natural selection and how it may be that some stimulus features such as the size of the egg result in an increased ability to trigger a FAP.  Examples  = Male stickleback mating behavior = A 3-spined stickleback like those used in Tinbergen's experiments. One example of fixed action patterns is the courtship and aggression behaviors of the male stickleback, particularly the three- spined stickleback, during mating season, described in a series of studies by Niko Tinbergen. During the spring mating season, male sticklebacks ventrum turns red and they establish a territory to build a nest. They attack other male sticklebacks that enter their territory, but court females and entice them to enter the nest to lay their eggs. Tinbergen used models of sticklebacks to investigate which features of male and female sticklebacks elicited attack and courtship behavior from male sticklebacks. Tinbergen's main findings were that male sticklebacks responded in a relatively invariant way and attacked even the most crude of models with a red belly, but in contrast, courted a model with a swollen belly. He also found that when presented with both a real male stickleback and a crude model, if the model's stomach was more red, the stickleback would attack the model as opposed to the other real male stickleback. = Greylag goose egg-retrieval behavior = A greylag goose which participates in the described egg-retrieval behavior. Another example of a behavior that has been described as a fixed action pattern is the egg-retrieval behavior of the greylag goose, reported in classic studies by Niko Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz. Like many ground-nesting birds, if an egg becomes displaced from the nest, the greylag rolls it back to the nest with its beak. The sight of the displaced egg is the sign stimulus and elicits the egg-retrieval behavior. First, the goose fixates its sight on the egg. Next, it extends its neck over the egg. Finally, it rolls the egg back to the nest using the underside of its beak. If the egg is removed from the goose during the performance of egg-rolling, the bird will continue with the behavior, pulling its head back as if an imaginary egg is still being maneuvered. It has been shown that the greylag will also attempt to retrieve other egg-shaped objects, such as a golf ball, door knob, or even a model egg too large to have possibly been laid by the goose itself (i.e. a supernormal stimulus).Tinbergen, N. (1951). The Study of Instinct. Oxford University Press, New York. The sight of the egg outside of the nest serves as the stimulus in this particular instance because it is only after the recognition of the eggs displacement that the fixed action pattern occurs. The manipulation of the sign stimulus through a series of experiments can allow scientists to understand what specific component of the stimulus is responsible the innate behavioral sequence. If the egg were to be picked up and taken away after it is displaced from the nest, the goose still exhibits the same head moving motion even though there is no egg present. This was put to the test by using objects such as beer cans, and baseballs. Experimenters found that the stimulus merely had to be an object that was large enough in size, convex enough in shape, and comfortable enough for the goose to lay its neck around the edges of the object. These features that the stimulus has to obtain in order to trigger a resulting FAP were then given the official term of Sign Stimuli. Scientists came to the realization that there must be an innate deciphering method that the goose goes through in order to determine a suitable sign stimulus. This was defined as an innate releasing mechanism (IRM). The goose's IRM when put to the test in the natural world not being manipulated by scientific experimentation is almost always efficient in getting the desired item of an egg back into the nest. = Other examples of sign stimuli= More examples of sign stimuli include: * The red mark on the mother's beak recognized by kelp gull chicks. * Light polarization patterns recognized by mayflies when they are deciding where to drop their eggs. * The presence of a female sage grouse that causes males to exhibit a strut pattern display in order to attract the female during breeding season.  Evolutionary advantages  Most behaviors which are both fixed action patterns and occur in more complex animals, are usually essential to the animal's fitness, or in which speed (i.e. an absence of learning) is a factor. For instance, the greylag goose's egg-retrieval behavior is so essential to the survival of its chicks that the fitness of the parent bird is increased by the behavior being relatively invariant. A stickleback will attack any male fish who enters his territory while the female is sexually receptive, reacting to their red color, while the female stickleback triggers behavior in the male resulting in the fertilization of her eggs.  Evolutionary disadvantages  Brood parasites, such as the cuckoo, provide a supernormal stimulus to the parenting species. Fixed action patterns are predictable, as they are invariable, and therefore can lead to exploitation. Some species have evolved to exploit the fixed action patterns of other species by mimicry of their sign stimuli. Replicating the releaser required to trigger a fixed action pattern is known as code- breaking. A well-known example of this is brood parasitism, where one species will lay its eggs in the nest of another species, which will then parent its young. A young North American cowbird, for example, provides a supernormal stimulus to its foster parent, which will cause it to forage rapidly to satisfy the larger bird's demands.Wickler, W. (1968) Mimicry in Plants and Animals. World University Library, London. A nestling will provide higher levels of stimulus with noisier, more energetic behavior, communicating its urgent need for food. Parents in this situation have to work harder to provide food, otherwise their own offspring are likely to die of starvation. = Brood parasitism = The exploitation of sign stimuli can be seen when exploring the concept of brood parasitism. Other animals will learn the sign stimuli of different species and use it to manipulate the other animal into doing something for its own benefit. An example of this can be seen in the European cuckoo. This particular species of bird benefits by handing off the task of raising their young to other species of birds who will care for any egg that is found in its nest. In this case the sign stimulus is the presence of the eggs in the nest. If the other bird does not recognize the other bird's egg as foreign, it will continue on caring for it as its own by incubating it and hatching it. Once it is hatched, the young cuckoo ensures for itself a solid upbringing by instinctively pushing its neck around anything that is solid in the nest and pushing it over the edge. Thus classifying the sign stimulus as any solid object. This allows for the cuckoo's now foster parents to have plenty of time to devote to caring for it without any other distractions.  Exceptions  There are 4 exceptions to fixed action pattern rules. These include reduced response threshold, vacuum activity, displacement behavior, and graded response. = Reduced response threshold = Fixed action patterns become easier to release as time increases between the last release. = Vacuum activity = After so long without being released, fixed action patterns are released in the absence of the sign stimulus or releaser. Vacuum activity is demonstrated in courtship behavior of ring doves. Male blond ring doves isolated from their own species will resort to courting a pigeon, then a human's hand, and finally expressing courtship activity alone in their box, if they are left alone for a long period of time. = Displacement behavior = Fixed action patterns may be performed that are irrelevant to the stimulus present.Tinbergen, N., Van Iersel, J. J. A. (1947). Displacement reactions in the three-spined stickleback. Behaviour , 1, 56-63. http://www.jstor.org/stable/4532675. This can be seen in sticklebacks. Displacement behavior occurs when the fighting and mating urges are frustrated. A male stickleback chasing another male stickleback stops where their two territories meet and dives to the bottom of the tank, picking something up. This behavior resembles that of nest digging during mating season, but is not released by the proper sign stimulus. = Graded response = Fixed action patterns may vary in intensity instead of being triggered.

It is slightly similar to the game Screen Ball, and began in the 1940s or 1950s as a penalty phase of various city street games. Butts Up is played with a ball (such as a tennis ball, handball, or racquetball) on a paved surface against a wall, with a variable number of participants‚Äîusually more than three and often likely to exceed ten. Butts Up tends to be played during recess, before or after school. . Popular in New England is another frequent variation of wallball that usually differs a lot from the more widely known 'Butts Up'. Players determine the variations of the game prior to start of play. Some of the rules of the game very loosely resemble the rules of baseball and racquetball. Names There are many alternate names for butts up. These include \\"Spread Eagle\\", \\"A-Ball\\",\\"A-Hole\\", \\"Asses Up\\", \\"Assies' Rehab & Tea\\", \\"Suey\\", \\"Balliver Shagnasty's Revenge\\", \\"Balls Deep\\", \\"Ballsies\\", \\"Beartrap\\", \\"Burn\\",Children's Folklore: A Handbook, p.75When Play Was Play: Why Pick-Up Games Matter, p 76 \\"Blackjack\\", \\"Blue Gooch\\", \\"Booties Up\\", \\"Brandings\\", \\"Buju Gay\\", \\"Buns Up\\", \\"Burn Ball\\", \\"Burn\\", \\"Butt Ball\\", \\"Buttock Blocker\\", \\"Chance\\", \\"Chinese Suicides\\", \\"Electric Booty\\", \\"Error\\", \\"Fire in the Bum\\", \\"Fumble\\", \\"Glempner\\", \\"Jetters\\", \\"Kirby\\", \\"Limo\\", \\"Murderball\\", \\"No Fear\\", \\"Off the Wall\\", \\"Peanut Butter\\", \\"Pee Pee'd\\", \\"Peg\\", \\"Red Ace\\", \\"Red Ass\\", \\"Red Bum\\", \\"Red Butt\\", \\"Red Out\\", \\"Rosies\\", \\"Rump Rounders\\", \\"Sky Blue\\", \\"Slaughterhouse\\", \\"Spread\\", \\"Sting\\", \\"Stitch\\", \\"Suicide\\", \\"Kill\\" and \\"Wall Ball\\". Object of the game The object of the game is to be the last player remaining in the game after all other players are out. In some variations of the game, there is no specific object of the game. Play continues until time runs out. In this variation, when players are \\"out\\" three times, they must lean against the wall and wait to be hit by the ball (\\"Butts Up\\"). See below for more on this. Rules of the game The first player, usually the tennis ball owner, starts the game or \\"breaks the ice\\" (see terminology below) by throwing the ball against the wall with the objective of having the ball hit the wall without hitting the ground first or if someone catches the ball in the air before it hits the ground and yells,‚ÄùPoison‚Äù and throws the ball at the wall before the thrower touches the wall he‚Äôs out. After the ball makes contact with the wall and bounces off the ground at least once, any of the players, including the thrower, may then try to catch the ball. If catcher mishandles the ball and the ball touches the ground, the catcher must try to touch the wall before another player fields and throws the ball against the wall. If the ball touches the wall before the catcher, the catcher is out and must face various consequences. Under some rules, instead of hitting the wall other players must hit the catcher with the ball before the catcher touches the wall to get the catcher out. Under other rules there is an option to hit the wall or the catcher to get the catcher out. If the ball is caught before hitting the pavement, the thrower is penalized with one \\"out\\", much like baseball. Some refer to this as a \\"cobra\\", or \\"ace\\". After three outs a player leaves the game. Sometimes alternate words, such as \\"wall,\\" are used instead. In some cases, such as in New York City, the catcher has to \\"peg\\" the thrower, while the thrower tries to touch the wall, if the thrower misses, the throwers doesn't get an out. If the thrower's ball bounces before hitting the wall, the thrower must run to the wall and touch the wall before an opponent can pick up the ball and throw it to the wall. If the original thrower doesn't make contact with the wall before the ball reaches the wall, the original thrower is out. If the thrower reaches for the ball, but has it bounce off his fingers and onto the pavement, this counts as missing the throw, and he must run to the wall. In one variation of the game, a runner who does not reach the wall before the thrown ball hits must, in addition to receiving an out, stand facing the wall and allow the thrower to \\"peg\\" him or her with the ball (usually with all possible force). In the \\"Blue Gooch\\" variation of the game, the player who is \\"out\\" must keep their legs apart, so the thrower has a chance at shooting them in the perineum. In another variation, when a player is \\"out\\" three times, he or she must lean against the wall, bent over with his butt in the air‚Äîhence the name of the game‚Äîand wait for the ball to be thrown at him. Other players take turns throwing the ball until he is hit. If he doesn't look back, the thrower must lob the ball in the air, but if he does, the thrower may peg him with as hard a throw as he likes. Also, in this version, the thrower must hit the player as he is running to the wall, rather than hitting the wall, to get the runner out. The game continues until all but one player have received three outs and left the game. This form of the game is referred to as \\"three‚Äìout elimination\\". In New York City, the game is usually called \\"Asses Up\\", and the game is played exactly the same, the only major difference is that when ever a kid is \\"out\\", or doesn't touch the wall before the ball or is hit with the ball by another player, instead of eliminated after three \\"outs\\", they get eliminated when they complete the word \\"Asses Up\\" with each \\"out\\" is a letter in the game (I.e. A-S-S-E-S-U-P). This is similar with spelling out \\"Horse\\" in Basketball. Also, the term \\"Reach\\" is used when a catcher is far away, and the ball is usually thrown at the thrower as an alternative to \\"pegging\\" (usually when smaller kids are playing). In a variation practiced widely in Santa Clara County, California elementary schools as late as the mid-1980s, each time a player earned an out, his \\"butt was up,\\" and he would stand with hands against the wall, waiting to be pegged by the player who threw him out. If the player is hit in the \\"target area,\\" he is convicted of the out, and gets a letter (B-U-T-T, for example), and leaves the game. In this variation, at the ice breaker's discretion, play may pass by number, i.e., Player 1 breaks the ice, then Player 2 must retrieve and throw the ball, followed by Player 3, etc. In more physical games, the ball is not required to bounce after touching the wall, and aggressive players will stand near the wall, within arms' reach, pegging other players and quickly touching the wall, then retrieving the ball and throwing the other player out. Other rules included \\"handsies\\", which prohibits players from touching the ball with both hands at once (the ball could be tossed in the air and caught with the other hand, but typically a great show was made of this feat in order to avoid even the appearance of a foul). Also, a player with ball in hand must keep one foot planted at all times, or, in the interest of justice, if a player was stranded well beyond throwing or relay distance (see \\"Savies\\"), he could take one large step toward the wall. If a player realizes he has mishandled the ball and thus must \\"hit the wall,\\" and deliberately \\"spikes\\" the ball to frustrate others' attempts to throw him out, his butt is automatically up; at the other players' discretion, they may each take a turn at throwing that player out. The attack does not cease simply because a pegger has successfully scored in the target area; each player throws nonetheless, usually with intent to cause injury or disfigurement. In more recent variations of the game, a player only receives an out if he or she is actually hit by the peg, rather than receiving it for having to be on the wall. Also, if a player wins without having gotten an out, the win is called a 'lockdown'. In New England, specifically the Tri-State Area, another version of Wall Ball was invented. In this variation two or more people line up to take turns hitting the ball. The ball must bounce first, then hit the wall, then bounce; the next person in line must hit the ball before its second bounce on the ground, then the ball must hit the wall, then bounce. This repeats for however many people there are. It is usually played with three outs, but the number could vary depending on the number of people. There are also many variations in each school, but the overall premise is usually the same. Wall Ball in New England is usually considered a separate game from Butts Up. In some areas in Westchester county, this variant is called \\"Watermelon\\", which is named for the legal action of going completely under the ball as a hit. In a Maryland version of wallball, the icebreaker starts the game, with all other players nearby. Players are allowed to catch the ball if it has not bounced, as well as catching other players' throws. Failing to catch the ball, taking too long to get a handle on the ball or any other type of \\"bobbling\\" is the \\"bobblers\\" cue to touch the wall. If a player is relatively far from the wall while holding the ball, other players may call \\"wallball\\" (hence the name), meaning the player with the ball has ten seconds to hit the wall, without moving or bouncing the ball off the ground. If a player is out, he must stand on the wall and get pegged by the player who got him out. If the peg is successful (player hit), play continues with the icebreaker throwing the ball first. If the peg is unsuccessful (player not hit), other players have the opportunity to get the thrower out. No penalty besides pegging occurs from an out. Fouls include kicking the ball, preventing a player from getting you out (kicking or throwing the ball after bobbling as opposed to dropping it), tampering with a throw or interfering with a peg (interference can also occur if a player running to touch the wall is obstructed by another player.) Interference is determined by the other players in the game. Yet another playground version of the game (popular in southern Arizona) simply had all the participants apart from the first player line up against the wall, with the immediate goal of the first player to hit a participant with the ball (typically as hard as possible) and thus make that participant \\"it\\". This version resembles dodge ball but with the wall limiting the possible dodging moves to two dimensions rather than three. Any participant who strayed too far away from the wall during play was \\"punished\\" by a penalty shot, where the thrower would aim solely at him or her and throw the ball as hard as possible, although a hit in this case did not make the person \\"it\\". When a player became \\"it\\" by legal means, he or she assumed the role of \\"thrower\\". The object of this game‚Äîlike many other playground games‚Äîwas simply to inflict pain on classmates, and was thus often played in relatively obscure or off-limits areas of the playground. Another version of wallball is that the ball is catchable off the wall and the catching player can move about freely as long as they throw the ball within the next few seconds. If the ball bounces very far away from the wall the other players may call \\"challenge\\" to the player with the ball. A call of challenge means the player may not move and must throw the ball and try to hit the wall. If the player chooses to drop the ball at his/her feet then the player is automatically out. The thrower, however, may choose to simply throw it at an object that would cause the ball to be hard to get before the thrower can be thrown out, possibly causing a successive number of challenges until a suitable throw has been made. If a player catches the ball they may run to the wall and place both their off hand and foot on the wall and call \\"bulldog.\\" If the player does this they can freely throw the ball at whomever they wish. If they hit another player then the hit player must touch the wall before they are thrown out. \\"Bulldogs\\" are usually frowned upon by other players and considered a cheap way of getting other players out. If a player has committed a double touch another player may call the foul and is allowed a throw at the person. The offending player must be \\"spread eagle\\" as it is called, against the wall and may not move. The thrower is not allow a full force throw unless the person moves or flinches as it is usually taken from a short distance. This can either result in a peg or a double throw depending on the rules. If the thrower makes a full force throw without the offender moving then the thrower must be pegged by the original offender. In some games the thrower on \\"spread eagle\\" must touch the wall or they too will be out, unless they missed and hit the wall. In Australian schools, most notably in Victoria and New South Wales, a variation, similarly called Fumble, is played. This game is indeed similar to Butts Up, but the main differences include: *Players can also get out if they are hit by the ball. If a player was to have a ball thrown at them, then that player, as well as the player who threw the ball, must run to the wall before the ball hits the wall. *If the ball hits the ground before it hits the wall, the player must touch the wall before the ball does. This is because the ball becomes anyone's ball, and therefore anyone can pick it up and throw it off the wall. *If you get out, you are placed in a waiting list. The first person to get out will be replaced by the person that gets out after him. *The ball is a normal handball, but can be varied, but usually it is a bouncy ball, that can repel off a wall at high speed. Of course, the rules vary per match and per school. Between all the schools, the variations shown are generally what are the most basic variations. Terminology *Black Mail or Reach: Once the ball is caught (usually from a long distance) any player may yell \\"Black Mail!\\" The player with the ball must now throw the ball to the wall without moving feet. *Break the Ice: To start the game by making the first throw regardless of ball ownership. * Savies or Taxis: If a player feels he is too far from the wall to throw the ball and make wall contact, the thrower can throw the ball to another player and hope the receiver will wait until the thrower has run to the wall and touched it. However, savies can backfire if the catcher betrays the thrower by throwing the ball to the wall before the thrower has run and touched the wall. In some places, there is no betrayal as, if you save them they don't have to run. *Chicken Drops: An alternative to Savies. If a player is too far from the wall to make a complete pass to hit the wall, he can drop the ball at his feet and head to the wall as quickly as he can to make contact. If another player picks up the ball that player can throw the runner out by getting the ball to the wall before the runner. This technique is frowned upon by Butts Up enthusiasts. *Double Touch: The act of a player touching the ball twice, resulting in an automatic out. Typically this occurs when the ball is bobbled or tripped over. *Handsies: (Some variations) The act of a player touching the ball with both hands at once, resulting in an obligation to \\"hit the wall\\". *Hit the Wall: Alternative terminology for a player's obligation, upon committing \\"handsies,\\" \\"chicken drops,\\" \\"traveling,\\" or other offense, failure to accomplish which before any other player has thrown the player out by causing it to hit the wall results in an out or the runner's butt being \\"up\\". *Peg: A player throws the ball at another player, usually resulting in an out for both players. *Self-Out: A player throws the ball to the wall and then catches it before the ball hits the pavement. This rule is optional and can be determined by the players prior to the start of the game. *Self-Peg: A thrower's ball bounces off the wall and hits the thrower. In this case the thrower must run to the wall and touch the wall before an opponent picks up the ball and throws it to the wall. *Stripping: In more physical iterations of the game, a player may attempt to strip the ball from the hand of another player. If successful, both players must run to the wall to avoid earning an out. *Tie Goes to the Runner: If there is a dispute among the players about whether a runner is safe or out, and the decision for and against is a 50/50 tie among players, the runner stays in the game. *Traveling: The act of a player moving both feet with ball in hand. *Lockdown: Occurs when a player wins the game without having gotten out. *Poison: When someone catches the ball without the ball hitting the ground. If they say \\"poison\\" the \\"poisoned\\" person must run to the wall before the person who caught the ball throws it to the wall. In the Australian schoolyard variation, the following are also included in the list of terminology used: *Fumbled: Yelled out when a player has fumbled the ball. *Truce: Said to another player when they want to give them the ball due to distance. *Full: Yelled out when the ball has been caught on the full by another player. *Run to the Wall, Run to the Wall: Yelled out when people have touched the ball *Shoddy/Dibs service: Yelled out at the beginning of a game when a player wants to throw first *Peg: Denotes when a player intentionally throws the ball at another player, usually requiring both players to hit the wall prior to another player doing so. *Blocker: If another player blocks the thrower and the ball rebounds off the player, then both the thrower and blocker need to run to the wall. *Lost ball: If the ball is lost in a drain or a Car Park, then the thrower must go and get it, no matter how perilous it is. *Near Miss: If the ball comes close to hitting another person not playing the game, the thrower is warned.

It is specifically used in iron overdose, hemochromatosis either due to multiple blood transfusions or an underlying genetic condition, and aluminium toxicity in people on dialysis. It is used by injection into a muscle, vein, or under the skin. Common side effects include pain at the site of injection, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, hearing loss, and eye problems. Severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and low blood pressure may occur. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe for the baby. Deferoxamine is a siderophore from the bacteria Streptomyces pilosus. Deferoxamine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1968. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses Deferoxamine is used to treat acute iron poisoning, especially in small children. This agent is also frequently used to treat hemochromatosis, a disease of iron accumulation that can be either genetic or acquired. Acquired hemochromatosis is common in patients with certain types of chronic anemia (e.g. thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndrome) who require many blood transfusions, which can greatly increase the amount of iron in the body. Treatment with iron-chelating drugs such as deferoxamine reduces mortality in persons with sickle cell disease or Œ≤‚Äêthalassemia who are transfusion dependent. Administration for chronic conditions is generally accomplished by subcutaneous injection over a period of 8‚Äì12 hours each day. Administration of deferoxamine after acute intoxication may color the urine a pinkish red, a phenomenon termed \\"vin ros√© urine\\". Apart from iron toxicity, deferoxamine can be used to treat aluminium toxicity (an excess of aluminium in the body) in select patients. In US, the drug is not FDA-approved for this use. Deferoxamine is also used to minimize doxorubicin's cardiotoxic side effects and in the treatment of a patient with aceruloplasminemia. Deferoxamine maybe effective for improving neurologic outcomes in persons with intracranial hemorrhage, although the evidence supporting the efficacy and safety for this indication was weak. Adverse effects It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. Chronic use of deferoxamine may increase the risk of hearing loss in patients with thalassemia major. Chronic use of deferoxamine may increase the risk of visual loss. Mechanism Deferoxamine is produced by removal of the trivalent iron moiety from ferrioxamine B, an iron-bearing sideramine produced by the actinomycetes, Streptomyces pilosus. Its discovery was a serendipitous result of research conducted by scientists at Ciba in collaboration with scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and the University Hospital in Freiburg, Germany Deferoxamine acts by binding free iron in the bloodstream and enhancing its elimination in the urine. By removing excess iron from persons with hemochromatosis, the agent reduces the damage done to various organs and tissues, such as the liver. Also, it speeds healing of nerve damage (and minimizes the extent of recent nerve trauma). Deferoxamine may modulate expression and release of inflammatory mediators by specific cell types. Research Deferoxamine is being studied as a treatment for spinal cord injuryhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/orphans/2009/11/human_orphan_000120.jsp‚à£=WC0b01ac058001d12b and intracerebral hemorrhage. It is also used to induce hypoxia-like environment in mesenchymal stem cells.  Costs  In the United States, a course of treatment has been estimated to have a retail cost, before insurance or discounts, of more than $200.

His predecessor, Ataulf, had been mortally wounded in his stables at the palace of Barcelona by an assassin. The assassin was probably a loyal servant of Sarus, a Gothic noble and personal enemy whom Ataulf had earlier slain. At Ataulf's death, Sarus' faction, the Amali, violated the laws of succession by immediately making Sigeric, the brother of Sarus, king. Edward Gibbon writes in the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire that the first act of Sigeric's reign \\"was the inhuman murder\\" of Ataulf's six children from a former marriage \\"whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.\\" As for Ataulf's widow, Galla Placidia, daughter of Roman Emperor Theodosius, she was \\"treated with cruel and wanton insult\\" by being forced to walk more than twelve miles on foot among the crowd of captives driven ahead of the mounted Sigeric. The noble widow's sufferings, however, became one of the factors that roused indignant opponents of the usurper, who quickly assassinated Sigeric and replaced him with Ataulf's relative, Wallia. Because Sigeric was an Amali, a member of a rival clan-based subgroup among the Visigoths to the Balti (of which Ataulf and Wallia were part), Sigeric is the only one who does not belong in the succession of kings usually labeled the Balti dynasty, if the kingship is defined by Balti dynastic connections. Due to this, as well as to the fact that his reign was a usurpation, and brief, Sigeric does not appear on some Visigothic king lists.

It is the deepest lake in Japan at . The area is a popular vacation area and several hot spring resorts can be found in the hills above the lake. Akita Prefecture's largest ski area, Tazawa Ski Area, overlooks the lake. Hydrology Lake Tazawa has a surface elevation of 249 meters, and its deepest point is 174.4 meters below sea level. Due to this depth, there is no possibility that the lake is frozen in the dead of winter. At , it is slightly deeper than Lake Shikotsu in Hokkaid≈ç (423.4 meters), and is the 17th deepest lake in the world. Lake Tazawa has no natural inflow or outflow, and in 1931, had a measured transparency of 31 meters, comparable with Lake Mash≈´, but with abundant aquatic organisms. However, due to the construction of hydroelectric power plant facilities and agricultural runoff, coupled with an influx of highly acid water from Tamagawa Hot Spring, transparency has been reduced to less than 4 meters, and by the late 1940s the lake had become so acidic (pH 4.3) that it could no longer support irrigated agriculture. Starting in 1972, the Japanese government has been attempting to rectify the acidity problem through introduction of lime, with a new facility completed in 1991. However, in the year 2000, the lake still had an acidity of 5.14 at the 200 meter depth, and 4.91 at the 400 meter depth, indicating that full recovery has not yet been achieved. Geology Due to its extreme depth, and almost circular profile, Lake Tazawa was considered to be either a caldera lake caused by volcanic activity or a crater lake caused by a meteorite impact. The depth of the lake was first measured as 397 meters, using a hemp rope, by Japanese geologist Tanaka Akamaro in 1909. The Akita Prefectural Fisheries Experiment Station survey indicated a depth of 413 meters in 1926 using a wire rope. During a three-year survey from 1937-1940, geologist Yoshimura Nobuyoshi surveyed the lake bottom, finding the deepest point to be . The survey also found two small volcanic cones and sedimentation deposits to the depth of around one kilometer on the north-west side of the lake bottom. These findings lend credence to the theory that the lake is indeed of volcanic origin, from an explosive eruption of 1.4 million years ago. Natural history Prior to 1940, the main species of fish in Lake Tazawa included the indigenous kunimasu (Oncorhynchus nerka kawamurae), Sockeye salmon, Japanese dace (genus Tribolodon), Japanese trout, char, carp, catfish and eel. However, after the acidic content of the lake changed in 1940, the only surviving fish is the dace, while most of the other species, including the kunimasu, are thought to have gone extinct. History Lake Tazawa was named in the Meiji period when its surrounding foothills were settled. However, the lake was known to the Ainu people, and the name ‚ÄúTazawa‚Äù is thought to be derived from the Ainu language Tapukopu (\\"hill with a raised circular top\\") The lake is also connected with the legendary maiden of beauty, Tatsuko, itself of unknown origin. Tazawa has a bronze statue of Tatsuko near its shore. Tatsuko, wishing for undying youth and beauty, is said to have been turned into a lake-goddess. The statue of Tatsuko by Yasutake Funakoshi stands with her back to the clear blue waters, a figure of pureness and beauty, and was unveiled on April 12, 1968.Funakoshi Yasutake - website of the Iwate Museum of Art (retrieved 2013-4-22)http://www.city.semboku.akita.jp/en/sightseeing/spot/04_tatsukozou.html (retrieved 2013-4-22) Notes References *Likens, Gene.

Nursing ethics shares many principles with medical ethics, such as beneficence, non-maleficence and respect for autonomy. It can be distinguished by its emphasis on relationships, human dignity and collaborative care. Development of subject The nature of nursing means that nursing ethics tends to examine the ethics of caring rather than 'curing' by exploring the everyday interaction between the nurse and the person in care. Early work to define ethics in nursing focused more on the virtues that would make a good nurse, which historically included loyalty to the physician, rather than the focus being on nurse's conduct in relation to the person in the nurse's care. In recent times, the ethics of nursing has also shifted more towards the nurse's obligation to respect the human rights and dignity of the patient and this is reflected in a number of professional codes for nurses, such as in the latest code from the International Council of Nurses. Distinctive nature Although much of nursing ethics can appear similar to medical ethics, there are some factors that differentiate it. Breier-Mackie suggests that nurses' focus on care and nurture, rather than cure of illness, results in a distinctive ethics. Furthermore, nursing ethics emphasizes the ethics of everyday practice rather than moral dilemmas. Nursing ethics is more concerned with developing the caring relationship than broader principles, such as beneficence and justice. For example, a concern to promote beneficence may be expressed in traditional medical ethics by the exercise of paternalism, where the health professional makes a decision based upon a perspective of acting in the patient's best interests. However, it is argued by some that this approach acts against person-centred values found in nursing ethics. The distinction can be examined from different theoretical angles. Despite the move toward more deontological themes by some, there continues to be an interest in virtue ethics in nursing ethics and some support for an ethic of care. This is considered by its advocates to emphasise relationships over abstract principles and therefore to reflect the caring relationship in nursing more accurately than other ethical views. Themes that emphasize the dignity of the patient by promoting a respectful and caring attitude from nurses are also commonly seen. Some themes in nursing ethics Nurses seek to defend the dignity of those in their care. Being able to respond to the vulnerability of patients in a way that provides dignifying care is a key concept in the field. In terms of standard ethical theory, respecting dignity can also be aligned with having a respect for people and their autonomous choices. People are then enabled to make decisions about their own treatment. Amongst other things this grounds the practice of informed consent that should be respected by the nurse, although much of the debate lies in the discussion of cases where people are unable to make choices about their own treatment due to being incapacitated or having a mental illness that affects their judgement. A suggested way to maintain autonomy is for the person to write an advance directive, outlining how they wish to be treated in the event of their inability to make an informed choice, thus avoiding unwarranted paternalism. Another theme is confidentiality and this is an important principle in many nursing ethical codes. This is where information about the person is only shared with others after permission of the person, unless it is felt that the information must be shared to comply with a higher duty such as preserving life. Related to information giving is the debate relating to truth telling in interactions with the person in care. There is a balance between people having the information required to make an autonomous decision and, on the other hand, not being unnecessarily distressed by the truth. Generally the balance is in favour of truth telling due to respect for autonomy, but sometimes people will ask not to be told, or may lack the capacity to understand the implications. Finally, the role of empirical ethics has become prominent in recent years. By giving consideration to the themes above, the nurse can endeavour to practice in an ethical way. This key outcome in nursing practice is sometimes challenged by resource, policy or environmental constraints in the practice area, which can lead to moral distress.

It emerged in the 1970s‚Äì80s, during which it was known as string music (), before gaining mainstream popularity during the 1990s. and has since dominated the Thai music industry. The term is extremely broad, covering Thai rock, dance music, rap and western-influenced popular music in general, though normally excluding the folk- and rock-influenced phleng phuea chiwit. The origins of string lie in American R&B;, surf-rock artists like The Ventures and Dick Dale, Exotica, rockabilly and country and western brought to Thailand by American and Australian soldiers serving in Vietnam in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It also drew heavily on genres from the British Invasion, including rock and roll, garage rock and Hollywood film soundtracks. Since the 1980s it has mixed with other genres, such as disco, funk, and dance. T-Wind T-Wind (Thai Wind) is a term used to describe the phenomenon of Thai pop culture in the international. It is a term created to compare Korean Wave. In the period since 2000, Thailand has been exporting many kinds of cultural products to many countries, especially in Southeast Asia, such as lakhon (television drama), movies and bl series from GMM‚ÄìGDH, lukkwad-pop (Thai teen pop) from K…ômik…ôze.

While it was first described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1772, this mushroom was a known favorite of early rulers of the Roman Empire. It has a distinctive orange cap, yellow gills and stipe. Organic acids have been isolated from this species. Similar orange-capped species occur in North America and India. It was known to and valued by the Ancient Romans, who called it Boletus, a name now applied to a very different type of fungus. Although it is edible, the Caesar's mushroom is closely related to the psychoactive fly agaric, and to the deadly poisonous death cap and destroying angels. Taxonomy and naming Amanita caesarea was first described by Italian mycologist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1772 as Agaricus caesareus, before later being placed in Amanita by Persoon in 1801. The common name comes from its being a favourite of the Roman emperors, who took the name Caesar (originally a family name) as a title. It was a personal favorite of Roman emperor Claudius. The Romans called it B≈çlƒìtus, derived from the Ancient Greek Œ≤œâŒªŒπœÑŒ∑œÇ for this fungus as named by Galen. Several modern common names recognise this heritage with the English Caesar's mushroom and royal amanita, French imp√©riale, Polish cesarski and German Kaiserling. In Italian, it is ovolo (pl. ovoli), due to its resemblance to an egg when very young. In Albanian it is kuq√´lorja from its colour (< Albanian kuqe 'red'). Other common names include Amanite des C√©sars and Oronge. It has also been classified as A. umbonata. A. hemibapha is a similar species originally described from Sikkim, India. It is widely eaten in the Himalayas and the Tibetan areas. Also North American collections have been labeled in the past as A. hemibapha. The relationship of the similar North American species A. arkansana and A. jacksonii to A. caesarea is not clear. The edibility of some of these similar species is also unclear, though A. jacksonii is eaten by many and there have been no reports of illness from it. A similar mushroom can also be found in La Esperanza, Honduras, where a festival is celebrated annually in its honor. A. caesarea was first domesticated in 1984. Description Specimen of A. caesarea This mushroom has an orange-red cap, initially hemispherical before convex and finally flat. The surface is smooth, and margins striated, and it can reach or rarely in diameter. The free gills are pale to golden yellow, as is the cylinder-shaped stipe, which is tall and wide. The ring hangs loosely and is lined above and smooth below. The base of the stipe is thicker than the top and is seated in a greyish-white cup-like volva, which is a remnant of universal veil. The spores are white. It could be confused with the poisonous fly agaric (Amanita muscaria). Though A. muscaria has a distinctive red cap dotted with fluffy white flakes, these tend to fall off as the carpophore ages and the bright red tends to fade to a yellowy orange. The latter mushroom will always have white gills and stalk with a ringed volva rather than a yellow stalk and is typically associated with spruce (Picea), pine (Pinus) or birch (Betula). Certain varieties (e.g. Amanita muscaria var. guessowii) are close to yellow even at the juvenile stage. =Chemical properties= A study of isolates from the fruit bodies of A. caesarea showed that the radial growth (increases in axon's diameter) of this species was possible at pH 6-7, and optimal growth was in a temperature of , depending on the isolate. An investigation of the heavy metal content of mushroom samples found cadmium levels in A. caesarea four times greater than allowed in cultivated mushrooms by EU standards. The amount of lead in A. caesarea also exceeded allowed levels. The study concluded that the accumulation of heavy metals may be a species-specific property of mushrooms, and that chronic consumption of some mushroom types could potentially be harmful. A study of the organic acid composition of mushrooms found a relatively high level, about 6 g/kg, in A. caesarea. Malic acid, ascorbic acid, citric acid, ketoglutaric acid, fumaric acid, shikimic acid and traces of succinic acid were detected. Malic and ascorbic acids were the most abundant compounds. Ergosterol has also been isolated from A. caesarea. =Edibility= A. caesarea is a highly appreciated mushroom in Europe. It is traditionally gathered and consumed in Italy, where it is known as ovolo or ovolo buono or \\"fungo reale\\". It has been traditionally taken as food in Mexico. There it is consumed roasted with a bit of the herb epazote, Dysphania ambrosioides. The international export market developed in the 1990s. Distribution and habitat A. caesarea specimen from Italy. It is found in southern Europe and North Africa, particularly in the hills of northern Italy. It is thought to have been introduced north of the Alps by the Roman armies as it is most frequently found along old Roman roads. The mushroom is also distributed in the Balkans, Hungary, India, and China (Sichuan Province). Although the species is not known to exist in the United States and Canada, it has been collected in Mexico. In Europe, Amanita caesarea inhabits primarily oak forests (Quercetum troianae Em. et Ht., Quercetum frainetto-cerris Rudsky. and Quercetum frainetto-cerris macedonicum Oberd., e.g.). It grows individually or in groups from early summer to mid autumn. In warmer climates this mushroom fruits in higher oak woodlands, sometimes mixed with conifers. Thus, in Mexico its natural habitat is oak, pine or fir forests at altitudes of above sea level, where it prefers plains and can occur at slopes of 20 degrees.

Born Irita Bradford in Birmingham, Alabama, her family moved to Tallahassee, Florida when she was four. Her father owned a sawmill and was killed by a disgruntled former employee when she was nine, so her mother had to support four children through music lessons and selling preserves. She graduated from the Florida State College for Women in 1908. She studied at Columbia University for her doctorate in English while teaching part-time at Hunter College. While at Columbia, she met fellow grad student Carl Van Doren, future Pulitzer Prize winner and member of the literary Van Doren family. They married in 1912, had three children, and divorced in 1935. She and her husband both joined the staff of The Nation in 1919 and she succeeded him as literary editor in 1923. She became assistant to Stuart Sherman, book editor of the New York Herald Tribune, in 1924 and succeeded him when he died in 1926. She held this post until 1963 and became an influential and prominent figure in American letters. She also hosted the popular Book and Author Luncheons, sponsored by the American Booksellers Association and the Herald Tribune, from 1938 to 1963. Radio broadcasts of the luncheons on WNYC began in 1948. Due to a mutual interest in southern history (Van Doren was the granddaughter of Union General William T. H. Brooks), she met Wendell Willkie, the Republican presidential nominee in 1940. Publicly good friends, they carried on a lengthy romantic affair. She introduced him to the literary world and assisted in writing his speeches and books. The Irita Van Doren Book Award was established in 1960 by the publisher of the Herald Tribune. Despite the urging of many, she never penned her memoirs, referring to herself as \\"the nonwriting Van Doren\\".

The northern peak of the Peruvian Cordillera Blanca mountain chain, Huascar√°n was named Cumbre A√±a Peck in Peck's honor. She was an ardent suffragist and noted speaker. She lectured extensively for many years throughout the world, and wrote four books encouraging travel and exploration.  Early life and education  An 1893 photograph of Peck Peck was born on October 19, 1850, in Providence, Rhode Island. She was the youngest of five children born to Ann Power (Smith) Peck (1820‚Äì1896) and George Bacheler Peck (1807‚Äì1882). Her brothers, George Bacheler Peck (1843‚Äì1934), a doctor; William Thane Peck (1848‚Äì1939), principal of Providence Classical High School; and John Brownell Peck (1845‚Äì1923), an engineer, merchant, teacher, and farmer; instilled a sense of competitiveness in Peck at a young age. Her sister, Emily Smith Peck (1847‚Äì1847), died in infancy. Peck grew up in Providence, where she attended Dr. Stockbridge's School for Young Ladies and Providence High School. Peck graduated in 1872 from Rhode Island Normal School (present-day Rhode Island College), a preparatory school for teachers. Peck briefly taught Latin at Providence High School, but wanted to attend Brown University like her father and brothers had done; however, she was refused admission to the university on the basis of her gender. Instead of attending Brown University, Peck moved to Saginaw, Michigan, intending to live on her own and support herself. Peck found work as a preceptress and teacher of languages and mathematics at Saginaw High School, where she remained until 1874. While teaching in Saginaw, Peck decided to further her education by earning an undergraduate degree from a university. When she wrote home to tell her family about her plans, they thought it was \\"perfect folly\\" for her to want attend college and graduate at the age of twenty-seven. In a letter to her father, Peck argued, \\"Why you should recommend for me a course so different from that which you pursue, or recommend to your boys is what I can see no reason for except the example of our great grandfathers and times are changing rapidly in that respect. I certainly cannot change. I have wanted it for years and simply hesitated on account of age but 27 does not seem as old now as it did. I should hope for 20 years of good work afterwards.\\" After learning that she insisted on earning the same education as her brothers, Peck's father agreed to support her education. In 1874 Peck enrolled at the University of Michigan, which opened its doors to women in 1871. (Ph.D. Dissertation) Peck earned an undergraduate degree with honors from the University of Michigan in 1878 with a major in Greek and classical languages and a master's degree in Greek from the university in 1881. She taught Latin and speech at Purdue University from 1881 to 1883. In 1884 Peck traveled to Europe, where she continued her education at Hannover, Germany, and at Athens, Greece. In 1885 Peck became the first woman to attend the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, where she studied archeology. Career Although Peck initially worked as a teacher, she took up the sport of mountaineering while studying in the mid-1880s. Beginning in 1892 she made her living as a public lecturer, mountaineer, and author of travel guides. As Peck began to climb, lecture, and explore in Latin America, she also promoted Pan- Americanism (peace between the Americas) and geographic education through her lectures, and publications. =Educator and lecturer= Peck worked as schoolteacher in Providence, Rhode Island, as well as Saginaw, Michigan; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Montclair, New Jersey. From 1881 to 1883 Peck was a professor of Latin and speech at Purdue University, and after returning from a two-year stay in Europe, she briefly taught Latin at Smith College from 1886 to 1887. By 1892 she gave up teaching and made her living by lecturing and writing about archeology, mountaineering, and her travels. =Mountain climber= Annie Smith Peck wearing climbing clothing in 1911 In 1885, while pursuing her education in Europe, Peck discovered her enthusiasm for mountaineering. She ascended moderate-sized mountains in Europe and in the United States, including California's Mount Shasta in 1888, the summit of Cape Misenum in Italy and small mountain passes in Switzerland, including Theodul Pass at . While in Greece, she climbed Mount Hymettus and Mount Pentecus, which ranged between and . In 1895 Peck followed in British mountaineer Lucy Walker's ascent of the Matterhorn, but Peck's accomplishment was overshadowed by what she wore during the climb. Her hiking attire included a hip-length tunic, tall climbing boots, and a pair of baggy-kneed knickerbockers trousers, and a felt hat she secured with a veil. At the time, Peck's unusual climbing costume attracted the press's attention and prompted public discussion and debate in the New York Times, for example, on the question of what women should do and what they can aspire to become. Peck climbed Pico de Orizaba and also Popocatepetl in Mexico in 1897. At the time her climb of Orizaba was the highest ascent in the Americas ever made by a woman. Three years later, in 1900, she climbed Monte Cristallo in the Italian Dolomites, the Jungfrau in Switzerland's Bernese Alps, and the F√ºnffingerspitze in Austria. Peck also helped to found the American Alpine Club in 1902. Although already over fifty years old, Peck wanted to make a record-setting climb. She traveled to South America in 1903, looking for a mountain taller than the Aconcagua in Argentina. She attempted Illamp√∫ in Bolivia in 1903 and again in 1904. Accompanied by two Swiss mountain guides in 1908, her expedition was the first to climb the north peak of the Huascar√°n in Peru. The south peak of Huascar√°n, which is taller than the north peak, was first climbed by Germans in 1932. Peck's accomplishment would have bested Fanny Bullock Workman's ascent of the Himalayan Pinnacle Peak, at it was the world record for highest altitude climb; however, Workman challenged Peck's claim of the new world's highest altitude record during her Huascar√°n climb. To validate her challenge, Workman paid engineers to recalculate Peck's altitude by triangulating the peak. The engineers established that Peck's Huascar√°n calculations had been wrong; she had misjudged the altitude by about , calculating it as due to broken altimeters, meaning that Peck had obtained the Americas record in the Western Hemisphere, while Workman remained the world record holder for highest altitude climb. In 1911, at the age of 61, Peck climbed one of the five peaks on Coropuna in Peru. Peck, an ardent suffragist, when she reached the top of Coropuna, Peck placed a \\"Votes for Women\\" banner at the summit. Peck later wrote a book about her experiences called A Search for the Apex of America: High Mountain Climbing in Peru and Bolivia, including the Conquest of Huascaran, with Some Observations on the Country and People Below (1911). Her famous quote, \\"My home is where my trunk is,\\" originated from this book. Later years In 1929‚Äì30, Peck made a seven-month trip, \\"mostly by airplane,\\" around South America in order to demonstrate the ease and safety of commercial flights for airline passenger. Her journey was the longest by air by a North American traveler at the time. After returning to the United States she published her fourth and final book: Flying Over South America: Twenty Thousand Miles by Air (1932). Peck also continued to scale mountains into her old age. She climbed New Hampshire's Mount Madison, her final mountain, at the age of eighty-two. Peck wrote two additional books about her travels, The South American Tour: A Descriptive Guide (1913) and Industrial and Commercial South America (1922). Both books were popular with diplomats, businessmen, corporations, politicians and tourists. In addition to becoming a founding member of the American Alpine Club in 1902, Peck became president of the Joan of Arc Suffrage League in 1914; a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1917; and was admitted to the Society of Woman Geographers in 1928. Death and legacy Peck, who never married, started a world tour in 1935 at the age of eighty-four, but became ill while climbing the Acropolis of Athens. She returned to her home at the Hotel Monterey in New York City and died of bronchial pneumonia on July 18, 1935. Peck's remains were cremated and her ashes were buried in the North Burial Ground cemetery in Providence, Rhode Island. Peck was remembered for her \\"adventurous spirit\\" in the sport of mountaineering, but her climbing accomplishments are not well known in the present-day. Her personal papers (1873‚Äì1935), including diaries, correspondence, and photographs are housed at the Brooklyn College Library Archives and Special Collections.

The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina were adopted on March 1, 1669 by the eight Lords Proprietors of the Province of Carolina, which included most of the land between what is now Virginia and Florida. It replaced the Charter of Carolina and the Concessions and Agreements of the Lords Proprietors of the Province of Carolina (1665). The date March 1, 1669 was the date that proprietors confirmed the Constitutions and sent them to the Colony, but later on two other versions were introduced in 1682 and in 1698. Moreover, the proprietors suspended the Constitutions in 1690. Despite the claims of proprietors on the valid version of the Constitution, the colonists officially recognized the July 21, 1669 version, claiming that six proprietors had sealed the Constitutions as \\"the unalterable form and rule of Government forever\\" on that date. The earliest draft of this version in manuscript is believed to be the one found at Columbia, South Carolina archives.Mattie Erma E. Parker, Apr. 1970, The First Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, The South Carolina Historical Magazine, The South Carolina Historical Society, 71-2 pp. 78-79 The Constitutions were \\"reactionary\\" and \\"experimented with a non-common law system designed to encourage a feudal social structure\\", including through the use of non-unanimous jury decisions for criminal convictions. Some scholars think that the Colonists, settlers and the British Crown kept themselves at a distance to the Constitutions from the beginning. However that is far from the truth: it was a legal document that drew on the King's earlier charter to the colony and reflected crucial legal realities. While the provisions of the Fundamental Constitutions were never fully employed nor ratified, the Constitutions did help to shape power in the Carolinas and especially land distribution. Colonists' main concerns over the document were its exaltation of proprietors as noblemen at the apex of the hierarchically designed society. Second, the Constitutions had rules that were hard to implement by settlers for practical reasons. Thus, the proprietors had to amend the rules five times. They were repealed in part after the revolution against James II‚Äîthe Glorious Revolution‚Äîwhich also reflected a partial reaction against such principles.\\"The Founding of North and South Carolina\\". Henrietta Elizabeth Marshall, A Celebration of Women Writers-Upenn Digital Library, 25.07.2015. However for eight proprietors and the king who were the authors of the \\"Fundamental Constitutions,\\" it reflected the proper order of governance, or as they wrote, they were creating a government with lords so \\"that the government of this province may be made most agreeable to the monarchy under which we live and of which this province is a part; and that we may avoid erecting a numerous democracy.\\"  Authorship  Because the Fundamental Constitutions were drafted during John Locke's service to one of Province of Carolina proprietors, Anthony Ashley Cooper, it is widely alleged that Locke had a major role in the making of the Constitutions. In the view of historian David ArmitageArmitage, 2004, p. 602-27. and political scientist Vicki Hsueh, the Constitutions were co-authored by Locke and his patron Cooper, known also as 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.Vicki Hsueh, Jul. 2002, \\"Theory and Practice in the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina,\\" Journal of the History of Ideas, University of Pennsylvania Press, 63-3, pp. 425-46. However the document was a legal document written for and signed and sealed by the eight Lord proprietors to whom Charles II had granted the colony; Locke was only a paid secretary. He wrote it much as a lawyer writes a will.  Main features  After Locke's later writings became famous (after the Glorious Revolution of 1689), his role brought attention to the Constitutions, particularly for its value in the context of classical liberalism. Armitage suggests that Constitutions were the first printed work with which Locke's name could be associated, and that it was published before his widely known writings Essay Concerning Human Understanding and the Two Treatises of Government published in 1689 and 1690.Armitage, 2004, p. 607. The STC catalog guesses there might be publications of the Fundamental Constitutions that correspond to the existing manuscripts (in 1670 and 1682). However first publication that can be confirmed is 1698, which postdates by almost a decade Locke's better known writings. The level of religious tolerance portrayed in the Constitutions was acclaimed by Voltaire who advised, \\"Cast your eyes over the other hemisphere, behold Carolina, of which the wise Locke was the legislator.\\" The Constitutions introduced certain safeguards for groups seeking refuge for religious reasons. To that end, Article 97 of the document foresaw: \\"‚Ä¶the natives who‚Ä¶are utterly strangers to Christianity, whose idolatry, ignorance, or mistake gives us no right to expel or use them ill; and those who remove from other parts to plant there will unavoidably be of different opinions concerning matters of religion, the liberty whereof they will expect to have allowed them‚Ä¶and also that Jews, heathens, and other dissenters from the purity of Christian religion may not be scared and kept at a distance from it‚Ä¶therefore, any seven or more persons agreeing in any religion, shall constitute a church or profession, to which they shall give some name, to distinguish it from others.\\" Accordingly, the Constitutions brought right to worship and right to constitute a church to the religious dissenters to Christianity and outsiders such as Jews. They also promised religious tolerance towards idolater Indians and heathens. The Constitutions also had less liberal and more aristocratic elements in it compared to the egalitarian, democratic and liberal standard of John Locke's much more famous, Two Treatises of Government. The Fundamental Constitutions promoted both aristocracy and slavery in North America. The notorious article 110 of the Constitutions stated that \\"Every freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves, of what opinion or religion soever.\\" Pursuant to this provision slaveholders were granted absolute power of life and death over their slaves.Armitage, 2004, p. 609 Additionally, the Fundamental Constitutions held that being a Christian does not alter the civil dominion of a master over his slaves. (Article 107)The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina: March 1, 1669. The Avalon Project, Yale Law School, Accessed 25.07.2015. Brewer argues that Locke's early involvement in the Fundamental Constitutions is evidence of his cooperation with Charles II's plans to promote slavery and hierarchy in the empire, but that in fact Locke's later writings show how his ideas formed in reaction to the societal vision propounded by the Fundamental Constitutions and other efforts of Charles II and his Privy Council to promote both hierarchy and slavery across the empire. Apart from the slavery, the erection of hereditary nobility and recognition of noble titles raised controversies. Because the King's original charter to the eight proprietors for Carolina prevented the proprietors from granting titles already in use in England, such as Earl or Baron, they created two new titles, cazique and landgrave, that would be passed down from father to son. Those nobles were granted privileges such as being tried only in Chief Justice's Court and being found guilty by a jury of their peers. (Article 27) The Constitutions introduced also a hereditary serfdom system, the members of which were called leetmen, in addition to slavery.WALBERT, D. (2008). A little kingdom in Carolina. Like the slaves, the leetmen and leetwomen were under command and jurisdiction of noblemen to whom they serve. (Article 22) Through the Constitutions, the Lords Proprietor and the noblemen owned the four-fifths of the Colony's vast lands. By the same token, the freemen had the right to property for the rest of the land and among them who owned more than fifty acres had right to vote and who had more than five-hundred acres of land had the right to be a member of Parliament. (Article 72) This requirement of land ownership has been considered as relatively favorable to the freemen in comparison to the England. Elections were to be held by secret ballot, which was not yet common practice in England. Laws were to expire automatically after one hundred years, thus preventing outdated regulations from remaining on the books.

The film, which combines live- action with animation, stars Philip Thomas, Charles Gordone, Barry White, and Scatman Crothers, all of whom appear in both live-action and animated sequences. Originally produced under the titles Harlem Nights and Coonskin No More... at Paramount Pictures, Coonskin encountered controversy before its original theatrical release when the Congress of Racial Equality criticized the content as being racist. When the film was released, Bryanston gave it limited distribution and it initially received mixed reviews. Later re- released under the titles Bustin' Out and Street Fight, Coonskin has since been re-appraised. A New York Times review said, \\"Coonskin could be Ralph Bakshi's masterpiece.\\" Bakshi has stated that he considers Coonskin to be his best film. Plot In a small town in Oklahoma, Sampson and the local Preacher plan to bust out their friend Randy from prison. As they rush to the prison, the two are stopped by a roadblock and have a shootout with the police. Meanwhile, Randy and another cellmate named Pappy escape from inside the prison and wait for Sampson and the Preacher to help them get out. While waiting for them, Randy unwillingly listens to Pappy tell a story about three guys that resemble Randy and his friends. Pappy's story is told in animation set against live-action background photos and footage. Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear, and Preacher Fox are forced to pack up and leave their Southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel. The trio moves to Harlem, \\"home to every black man\\". When they arrive, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox find that it is not all that it is made out to be. They encounter a con man named Simple Savior, a phony revolutionary leader who claims to be the cousin of \\"Black Jesus\\", and that he gives his followers \\"the strength to kill whites\\". In a flashy stage performance in his \\"church\\", Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression‚Äîrepresented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley, and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners for \\"donations\\". Rabbit and his friends quickly realize that Savior's \\"revolution\\" is merely a money-making scam. Rabbit openly steals a large portion of the donation money, prompting Savior to try to have him killed. After Rabbit tricks his would-be murderers (in a paraphrasing of the story of Br'er Rabbit and the brier patch), he and Bear kill Savior. This allows Rabbit to take over Savior's racket, putting him in line to become the head of all organized crime in Harlem. Rabbit lays out his plan to keep all organized crime money in Harlem. But first, he has to get rid of a few other opponents. Savior's former partners tell Rabbit they will join him but only if he can kill his opponents; otherwise they will kill him instead. Rabbit first goes up against Managan, a virulently racist and homophobic Irish police officer and bagman for the Mafia, who demonstrates his contempt for African- Americans in various ways, including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them (he believes that they are not worth it). When Managan finds out that Rabbit has been taking his payoffs, he and his cohorts, Ruby and Bobby, are led to a nightclub called \\"The Cottontail\\". A black stripper distracts him while an LSD sugar cube is dropped into his drink. Managan, while under the influence of his spiked drink, is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man, and then shoved into women's clothing representative of the mammy archetype, adorned in blackface, and shoved out to the back of the club, where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. While recovering from being drugged, he fires his gun randomly, and is brutally shot to death by the police after shooting one of the officers. Rabbit's final target is the Godfather who lives in the subway with his wife and his cross-dressing, gay (and possibly incestuous) sons. The contract for killing Rabbit is given to his only straight son Sonny. Arriving outside Rabbit's nightclub in blackface and clothing representative of minstrel show stereotypes, Sonny attempts to kill Rabbit, but Bear defends Rabbit, at the cost of getting shot by Sonny several times. When Sonny then attempts to escape in his car, he is shot multiple times by Rabbit before crashing into a wall and dying in the subsequent explosion. Rabbit then helps the injured Bear to safety. Sonny's body is cremated and taken back home, where his mother weeps over his ashes. During his recovery, Bear becomes torn between staying with Rabbit or starting a new crime-free life. Bear decides to look for Fox in order to seek his advice. Upon arriving at Fox's newly acquired brothel, Bear is \\"married\\" to a girl that he, Fox, and Rabbit met during the fight with Savior's men. Under the advisement of Fox, Bear becomes a boxer for the Mafia. During one of Bear's fights, Rabbit sets up a melting imitation of himself made out of tar. As the Mafiosos take turns stabbing at the \\"tar rabbit\\", they become stuck together. Rabbit leaves a bomb next to them and then he, Bear, Fox, and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up. The live-action story ends with Randy and Pappy escaping from the prison while being shot at by various white cops, but managing to make it out alive. The main plot of the film is interspersed with animated vignettes depicting a white, blonde, large-breasted \\"Miss America\\" who serves as a personification of the United States. In each of these short scenes, she seduces a black man (meant to depict the African-American populace), only to instead beat or kill him.

Ruddy during a screening of The Godfather, and pitched Harlem Nights to Ruddy. In 1973, production of Harlem Nights began, with Paramount Pictures (where Bakshi once worked as the head of its cartoon studio) originally attached to distribute the film. Bakshi hired several black animators to work on Harlem Nights, including graffiti artists, at a time when black animators were not widely employed by major animation studios. Production concluded in the same year. During production, the film went under several titles, including Harlem Days and Coonskin No More... A scene intended to satirize black stereotypes Coonskin uses a variety of racist caricatures from blackface minstrelsy and darky iconography, including stereotypes featured in Hollywood films and cartoons. In the book That's Blaxploitation! Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury), Darius James writes that \\"Bakshi pukes the iconographic bile of a racist culture back in its stupid, bloated face, wipes his chin and smiles Dirty Harry style. [...] He subverts the context of Hollywood's entire catalogue of racist black iconography through a series of swift cross-edits of original and appropriated footage.\\" The film also features equally exaggerated portrayals of white Southerners, Italians, and homosexuals. The depiction of Jewish characters stems from stereotypes portrayed in Nazi propaganda, including The Eternal Jew. In his review for The Hollywood Reporter, Arthur Knight wrote \\"Coonskin is not anti-black. Nor is it anti-Jewish, anti-Italian, or anti-American, all of whom fall prey to Bakshi's wicked caricaturist's pen as intensely as any of the blacks in his movie. What Bakshi is against, as this film makes abundantly clear, is the cheats, the rip-off artists, the hypocrites, the phonies, the con men, and the organized criminals of this world, regardless of race, color, or creed.\\" The film is most critical in its portrayal of the Mafia. According to Bakshi, \\"I was incensed at all the hero worship of those guys in The Godfather; Pacino and Caan did such a great job of making you like them. [...] One thing that stunned me about The Godfather movie: here's a mother who gives birth to children, and her husband essentially gets all her sons killed. In Coonskin, she gets her revenge, but also gets shot. She turns into a butterfly and gets crushed. [...] These [Mafia] guys don't give you any room.\\" The live-action sequences feature singers Barry White and Scatman Crothers, actor and playwright Charles Gordone, and actors Philip Michael Thomas, Danny Rees, and Buddy Douglas. Thomas, Gordone, and White also provide the voices of the film's main animated characters. In the film's ending credits, the actors were only credited for their live-action roles, and all voice actors who did not appear in the live-action sequences were left uncredited. Among the voices featured in the film was Al Lewis, best known for appearing as Grandpa on The Munsters. Bakshi also worked with Gordone on the film Heavy Traffic, and worked with Thomas again on the film Hey Good Lookin'. The film's opening credits feature a long take of Scatman Crothers performing a song on vocals and guitar called \\"Coonskin No More\\". Ralph Bakshi in January 2009 Coonskin uses a variety of different styles of artwork, filmmaking and storytelling techniques. Film critic Leonard Maltin wrote that Coonskin \\"remains one of [Bakshi's] most exciting films, both visually and conceptually.\\" Darius James writes that Coonskin \\"reads like an Uncle Remus folktale rewritten by Chester Himes with all the Yoruba-based surrealism of Nigerian author Amos Tutuola.\\" The film directly references the original African folk tales that the Uncle Remus storybooks were based on in two scenes that are directly reminiscent of the stories The Briar Patch and The Tar Baby. Writer and former pimp Iceberg Slim is briefly referenced in the dialogue of Preacher Fox, and the Liston‚ÄìAli fights are referenced in the film's final act, in which Brother Bear, like Sonny Liston, is sold out to the Mafia. The film also features a pastiche of cartoonist George Herriman and columnist Don Marquis' \\"archy and mehitabel\\", in a monologue about a cockroach that leaves the woman who loves him. Bakshi has stated that Herriman, a Biracial American Creole, is his favorite cartoonist. Release In order to attempt a contract killing on Brother Rabbit, white mobster Sonny disguises himself in blackface and clothing representative of minstrel show iconography, and uses a gun hidden in a banjo When the film was finished, a showing was planned at the Museum of Modern Art. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) surrounded the building, in a protest led by Elaine Parker. Gregg Kilday of the Los Angeles Times interviewed Larry Kardish, a museum staff member, and Kardish recalled that \\"About halfway into the film about ten members of CORE showed up. They walked up and down the aisles and were very belligerent. In my estimation they were determined not to like the film. Apparently some of their friends had read the script of the movie and in their belief it was detrimental to the image of blacks [...] The question-and-answer session with Bakshi that followed quickly collapsed into the chaos of a shouting match.\\" Animation historian Jerry Beck did not recall any disturbance during the screening, but said there were racist catcalls during the question-and-answer session, and Bakshi's talk was cut short. \\"It wasn't much of a madhouse, but it was kind of wild for the Museum of Modern Art.\\" Following the showing, the Paramount Building in New York City was picketed by CORE. Elaine Parker, chairman of the Harlem chapter of CORE, had spoken out against the film in January 1975. She told Variety that the film \\"depicts us as slaves, hustlers and whores. It's a racist film to me, and very insulting.\\" The Los Angeles chapter of CORE demanded that Paramount not release the film, claiming that it was \\"highly objectionable to the black community.\\" The NAACP had written a letter describing the film as a difficult satire, but supported it. With Paramount's permission, Bakshi and Ruddy got contractually released, and the Bryanston Distributing Company was assigned the rights to the film. Two weeks after the film opened, the distributor went bankrupt. According to a May 1975 issue of The Hollywood Reporter, Ben Gage was hired to re-record some of Barry White's voice tracks, in order to remove \\"racist references and vulgarity.\\" Coonskin was given limited distribution, advertised as a blaxploitation film. Roger Ebert wrote in his review of the film: > Coonskin is said by its director to be about blacks and for whites, and by > its ads to be for blacks and against whites. Its title was originally > intended to break through racial stereotypes by its bluntness, but now the > ads say the hero and his pals are out \\"to get the Man to stop calling them > coonskin.\\" The movie's original distributor, Paramount, dropped it after > pressure from black groups. Now it's being sold by Bryanston as an attack on > the system. [...] Coonskin is provocative, original and deserves better than > being sold as the very thing it's not. In a 1982 article published in The Village Voice, Carol Cooper wrote \\"Coonskin was driven out of theaters by a misguided minority, most of whom had never seen the film. CORE's pickets at Paramount's Gulf and Western headquarters and, later, a few smoke bombs lobbed into packed Broadway theaters were enough; theater owners were intimidated, and the auxiliary distributor, Bryanston, couldn't book the film. Bye-Bye Coonskin.\\" Critical response Initial reviews of the film were mixed. Playboy said of the film, \\"Bakshi seems to throw in a little of everything and he can't quite pull it together.\\" A review published in The Village Voice called the film \\"the product of a crippled hand and a paralyzed mind.\\" Arthur Cooper wrote in Newsweek, \\"[Bakshi] doesn't have much affection for man or woman kind‚Äîblack or white.\\" Eventually, positive reviews appeared in The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter, the New York Amsterdam News (an African American newspaper), and elsewhere, but the film died at the box office. Richard Eder of The New York Times wrote, \\"[Coonskin] could be his masterpiece [...] a shattering successful effort to use an uncommon form‚Äîcartoons and live action combined‚Äîto convey the hallucinatory violence and frustration of American city life, specifically black city life [...] lyrically violent, yet in no way [does it] exploit violence.\\" Variety called the film a \\"brutal satire from the streets. Not for all tastes [...] not avant-garde. [...] The target audience is youth who read comics in the undergrounds.\\" A reviewer for The Los Angeles Herald Examiner wrote \\"Certainly, it will outrage some and indeed it's not Disney. I liked it. The dialogue it has obviously generated‚Äîif not the box office obstacles‚Äîseems joltingly healthy.\\" Legacy Coonskin was later re-released under the title Bustin' Out, but it was not a success. In 2003, the Online Film Critics Society ranked the film as the 97th greatest animated film of all time. Coonskin was released on VHS by Academy Entertainment in late 1987,Solomon, Charles (1989), p. 275. Enchanted Drawings: The History of Animation. . New York City: Alfred A. Knopf. Accessed March 17, 2008. and later by Xenon Entertainment Group in the 1990s, both under the re-release title, Street Fight. The 1987 edition carried the disclaimer, \\"Warning: This film offends everybody\\". In 2010, Shout! Factory announced that Coonskin would be released on DVD in November 2010, intending to release it with a reversible cover with both titles of the film; the release was cancelled due to a legal issue involving ownership of the rights to the film, resolved with Xenon's eventual DVD release in 2012. The 2012 release was the first official home video release to carry the film's original title. In September 2012, Bakshi incorporated animation from Coonskin into a new short film, Trickle Dickle Down, criticizing Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

Wynn is the director of the United States Security Group, an umbrella agency encompassing the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and National Security Council. He is perhaps the most powerful man in the world, and has politicians throughout the government on his payroll. His actions caused Al Simmons' soul to be sent to Hell and transformed into Spawn in the first place, making him a major villain in the comics as a result. Wynn also runs a heavy trade within the black market, and has formed himself a multitude of underground alliances, some of which include the Chinese triads and the Mafia, whose boss, Tony Twist, answered directly to Wynn. He is depicted, in many ways, to be a reincarnation of Genghis Khan. Fictional character biography Wynn is responsible for the death of Al Simmons, who would later become Spawn. Simmons had been ordered to carry out too many bloody missions and atrocities with fewer and fewer satisfactory explanations, and was beginning to ask difficult questions; to Wynn, the master controller, this was intolerable. While on a mission, Wynn had Simmons ambushed by his partner, Chapel, and burned alive. As Spawn, Simmons came back seeking revenge, but Wynn somehow always manages to escape. Wynn uses Machiavellian intrigue and subtle machinations to expand his power base. Wynn provides weapons to rebel armies in different countries, sometimes playing two factions off against one another so that whoever wins will be indebted to him. He is cold, calculating, and utterly ruthless. =Deal with the \\"Devil\\"= Wynn had an agreement with Malebolgia in which he traded the soul of his best soldier, Simmons, in exchange for psychoplasm, the supernatural substance containing profound powers and is the very essence of what Hell is made of in the Spawn universe. The sample that Wynn obtained from the demon lord was combined with Simmons' memories and transformed into a training ground made up of building from his past known as \\"Simmonsville,\\" which was a small piece of Hell on Earth and a very important project run by the US Government. Simmonsville was destroyed by Spawn during Wynn's brief stint as Anti-Spawn/Redeemer I. Because Wynn was tainted by evil, he could not attain his full potential as the Redeemer and was defeated, had his memory wiped and was returned to Earth two days after his disappearance. After this, Wynn would continue to work off and on with The Clown, Malebolgia's henchman, to try to bring about Spawn's second death. =The Return= When Mammon restored The Clown's existence on Earth and gave him a pass to take a new body, the Clown chose Wynn and assumed a dominant role in his psyche. The Clown took the form of a hallucination which allowed Wynn to collect himself enough to return to the NSA. He then went on a killing spree in his spare time, brutally murdering women that resembled Wanda Blake. Wynn was caught in the act, and the Clown's face paint, at a construction site. Spawn beat him and saved the woman. The Clown finally made his play for Wynn's body. By \\"stepping on his hands,\\" he caused Wynn to let go of the steel girder he was clinging to and fall to his apparent death, then took full possession of his body. =Current status= During the torture of Spawn by Grand Inquisitor Thamuz, Wynn was seen in the assembled rogues gallery alongside Clown and The Violator, but it was revealed that they were lower-level demons, masked in the visage of Spawn's enemies through the magic of Thamuz. Wynn reappeared in issue 167‚Äì168. After the white light event, he is alive and separated from Clown, the only side effect being that his hands have become permanently stained red. Though he attempts to regain his political power and authority, he is foiled by Spawn, who confronts Wynn to gather information on the reappearance of Clown/Violator. Throughout his career, Jason Wynn had gathered incriminating evidence on various governments and organizations, preventing him from being terminated and providing him with a bargaining chip to regain his authority if lost. However, Spawn reveals that he had found and destroyed Wynn's collection of evidence, leaving Wynn without the safety net that he had built for himself as protection against all those who want him dead. Spawn then leaves Wynn to his predicament, seeing Wynn as a \\"dead man\\". In Spawn #227, Jason Wynn was finally hunted down and strangled to death by the new Spawn, former scientist Jim Downing, whose wife was tortured by Wynn prior to his transformation.. In other media = Television = Jason Wynn appears in the Spawn cartoon series, voiced by John Rafter Lee. = Film = Jason Wynn appears in the 1997 film Spawn, portrayed by Martin Sheen. This version of Wynn is the head of an agency known as A6 and is Al Simmons's boss. Unlike his comics counterpart, Wynn in the film kills Simmons in person with Jessica Priest's help rather than ordering his murder. Following the attack by Simmons, Violator convinces Wynn to have a device attached to his heart that will release Heat 16 worldwide if his vital signs flatline as a deterrent against assassination attempts. However, Malebolgia wants Simmons to kill Wynn and initiate the apocalypse. After Terry Fitzgerald sends an e-mail to reporters that would expose Wynn's illegal activities, Cyan and Wynn enter the room. Wynn destroys Terry's computer and takes the family hostage as Violator shows up. Spawn arrives and nearly kills Wynn, but Al extracts the device from Wynn's body with magic and destroys it. Following the defeat of Violator, Wynn is arrested by two detectives that resemble Sam and Twitch. = Video games = Wynn has appeared as an antagonist in a number of video games based on Spawn including Spawn: Armageddon, Todd McFarlane's Spawn: The Video Game, Spawn: The Eternal and Spawn: In the Demon's Hand. Wynn was mentioned in Mortal Kombat 11 by Sonya Blade who says that he's now an enemy of the US Government. = Action figures = Like many characters in the Spawn Universe, Wynn has been made into a number of action figures.

Biography =Early life and education= Born in New Echota, Georgia, he was the son of John Ridge, and the grandson of Major Ridge, both of whom were signatories to the Treaty of New Echota, which Congress affirmed in early 1836, ceding Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi River and ultimately leading to the Trail of Tears. At the age of twelve, Ridge witnessed his father's death at the hands of supporters of Cherokee leader John Ross, who had vehemently opposed the treaty. His mother, Sarah Bird Northrup (a white woman), took him and fled to Fayetteville, Arkansas. In 1843, he was sent to the Great Barrington School in Great Barrington, Massachusetts for two years, after which he returned to Fayetteville to study law. It was during this period that his first known writing appeared in print. He published a poem, \\"To a Thunder Cloud,\\" in the Arkansas State Gazette.Gordon Fraser. \\"Yellow Bird and the Thunder: On Finding the Earliest Known Poem by John Rollin Ridge, the First Native American Novelist.\\" Common- place. 14.4 (2014). http://www.common-place.org/vol-14/no-04/tales/#.VNU_6NLF- So He married Elizabeth Wilson, a white woman, in 1847. They had one daughter, Alice, in 1848. =On the run= In 1849, he killed Ross sympathizer David Kell, whom he thought had been involved with his father's assassination, over a horse dispute. Despite having a good argument for self-defense, he fled to Missouri to avoid prosecution. The next year, he joined in the California Gold Rush, but disliked being a miner. While there, he was reunited with his wife and daughter. =Writing career= His writing career began with poetry (published posthumously) and essays for the Democratic Party before what is now considered the first Native American novel and the first novel written in California, The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta: The Celebrated California Bandit (1854). A fictionalized version of the notorious bandit's story, the tale describes a young Mexican who comes to California to seek his fortune during the Gold Rush and turns to crime after his wife is raped and his brother murdered by white men. This novel, which condemned American racism especially towards Mexicans, later inspired the Zorro stories. Although widely popular, Ridge saw no money from the book's publication‚Äîby the time of his death it had not yet even turned a profit. Ridge was a writer and the first editor of the Sacramento Bee and also wrote for the San Francisco Herald, among other publications. As an editor, he advocated assimilationist policies for American Indians as his father had, placing his trust in the federal government to protect their rights. At the same time, however, he was blind to the ways in which those rights were continually abused by the same government. Despite his novel's stance against racism, Ridge had owned slaves on his Arkansas property and felt that California Indians were inferior to those of other tribes. The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta Ridge's novel, one of the earliest by a Native American author, is curious both because it is written not about a Native American subject, but about a Mexican immigrant, and because it is not original but based on a legendary figure widely discussed in the media of the day. Ridge presents the figure of Joaquin Murieta as that of a young, innocent and industrious man who is hampered in his attempts to be successful in the United States by the racism of the people and by the 1850 Foreign Miner's Tax Law, which severely hampered the ability of Latinos to mine for gold. Ridge's version of Murieta becomes a bandit who attracts a large number of associates and who terrorizes the state of California for several months with his gruesome acts of violence. At the same time, Ridge's Murieta is a romantic figure, often showing kindness (especially to women) and relishing the stories about him, even as he keeps his identity so well secret that he can walk through town in broad daylight with no one recognizing him. Although the novel is fictional, many people took it as fact and some historians even cited it when writing biographical materials on Murrieta. =Civil War and the Southern Cherokee delegation= During the Civil War, Ridge openly supported the \\"Copperheads\\" and opposed both the election of Abraham Lincoln as well as the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, blaming the war on abolitionists. After the war, Ridge was invited by the federal government to head the Southern Cherokee delegation in postwar treaty proceedings. Despite his best efforts, the Cherokee region was not admitted as a state to the Union. Death In December 1866, Ridge returned to his home in Grass Valley, California, where he died of \\"brain fever\\" (Encephalitis lethargica) on October 5, 1867.\\" American Indian Biography: John Rollin Ridge, Cherokee Writer.\\" Posted by Ojibwa on Native American Netroots, January 4, 2011.

General description  Cross-sectional image of the 4S design The plant design is developed by a partnership that includes Toshiba and the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) of Japan.Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry The technical specifications of the 4S reactor are unique in the nuclear industry. New Energy and Fuel. Accessed 3 May 2018. The actual reactor would be located in a sealed, cylindrical vault 30 m (98 ft) underground, while the building above ground would be 22√ó16√ó11 m (72√ó52.5√ó36 ft) in size. This power plant is designed to provide 10 megawatts of electrical power with a 50 MW version available in the future. Japan Times. The 4S is a fast neutron sodium reactor. It uses neutron reflector panels around the perimeter to maintain neutron density. These reflector panels replace complicated control rods, yet keep the ability to shut down the nuclear reaction in case of an emergency. Additionally, the Toshiba 4S utilizes liquid sodium as a coolant, allowing the reactor to operate 200 degrees hotter than if it used water. Although water would readily boil at these temperatures, sodium remains a liquid; the sodium coolant therefore exerts very low pressure on the reactor vessel even at extremely high temperatures. The Toshiba 4S Nuclear Battery was proposed as the power source for the Galena Nuclear Power Plant in Alaska, but the project was abandoned in 2011 and Toshiba did not proceed with an application for certification of the design.

The book tells the story of the final year in the life of the title character, Ricardo Reis, one of the many heteronyms used by the Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa. In the novel, Ricardo Reis returns to Lisbon from Brazil, upon receiving word of Pessoa's death. While there, he chooses not to resume practicing medicine, but rather takes up residence in a hotel, where he wastes his days reading newspapers and wandering the streets of Lisbon. The novel was translated into English by Giovanni Pontiero in 1991 and won the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize.  Themes  The novel addresses several powerful literary themes, though mostly indirectly. For instance, Reis reads of the events leading to the Spanish Civil War, and he sees floods of Spanish immigrants arrive in Lisbon seeking refuge, but he never expresses strong feelings or even a cogent understanding of the meaning of the conflict. Reis also carries on a lackluster love affair, but even in what seems to be his most intimate relationships, he is continually and voluntarily alienated from society. The most revealing glimpse of Reis is through a series of conversations with the spirit of Fernando Pessoa, over the course of which Reis loses a clear concept of the nature of life and death and the difference between the two. In the novel's final scene, Reis \\"dies\\" by calmly putting on his jacket and following Pessoa into the graveyard. Ultimately, the novel is a story of one man's attempt to resist any sort of cultural contextualization and reject any place in society whatsoever. This book is also, in some sense, an exercise in meta-literature. Fernando Pessoa created the character of Ricardo Reis fifty years or more before this novel was written, giving him a biography and writing many poems in that name. That Saramago would place the two characters side by side suggests a deliberate blurring of the boundaries between fantasy and reality, a common theme in Saramago's work, and a rejection of traditional limitations on narrative practices. Reis spends much of his time reading a novel called The God of the Labyrinth, a fictional novel mentioned by the writer Jorge Luis Borges and attributed to the title character of his short story \\"A Survey of the Works of Herbert Quain\\".  Style  The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis is written in Saramago's distinctive style, in which he disregards the traditional use of punctuation, except for commas and periods, which denote dialogue and changes in the speaker using only capital letters. Saramago uses long, flowing sentences and paragraphs often several pages in length. Saramago also digresses from the story frequently, occasionally even in the first person, remarking philosophically on the significance of images, objects, or situations encountered in the story. Saramago‚Äôs writing technique often has strong magical-realist elements.

Harvey drew the lettering in 1988 as part of the book-jacket design for James F. Peck's book In the Studios of Paris: William Bouguereau and His American Students, a Yale University Press publication. That lettering became the foundation for the 1986 typeface Andreas. In keeping with the book's subject, Harvey wanted letterforms that reflected the Art Nouveau period. The letterforms also bear comparison with the condensed, calligraphic thirteenth-century Italian monumental capitals. Due to space constraints, the type had to be narrow enough to allow the title to fit on a single line across the top, so as to not intrude on the Van Gogh painting that filled the rest of the jacket. To accomplish this he drew the letterforms freehand, giving them highly animated organic strokes and narrow character set. He also added distinctive junctions of letter strokes to the D, P, and R. The typeface was drawn in outline, intending to reverse to white, so as to not be overly assertive on the cover.

River's sister Rain would periodically attend a part of a rehearsal but officially joined about a year later. It is a common mistake that Rain started the band with River. Although she had sung along with River since they were young, she in fact, showed little interest during the first year or more of Aleka's Attic (prior to that name as well) when it was only River and Josh \\"Greene\\" (as he went by during that time) Greenbaum in the garage working on songs most of that first year plus. History The original line up of Aleka's Attic included River as lead singer and played guitar; his younger sister Rain sang, but, contrary to many incorrect reports, did not play keyboards in the band (although she did play various percussion, such as tambourine); Tim Hankins played the viola; Josh McKay was the bass player; Josh Greenbaum, a friend of River‚Äôs from Florida, was the drummer. About choosing the band's name, \\"Aleka's a fictional poet-philosopher who gathered friends in his attic to discuss his ideas, when Aleka dies they form a band to share his beliefs with others through music\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXN1gSM1UZ8 River was offered to sign a two-year development deal with Island Records to develop the band and record a marketable album, which was not accomplished in the time allotted due to River's ongoing film work schedule. So Island, retaining the option to continue or not, opted out of the deal based on the non-marketability of River's newer material. River then decided to record an album independently for the band. The unreleased album The release of the album, with the proposed titles Never Odd Or Even and Zero, was postponed due to River's death. Though Rain spent two years weeding through unfinished tracks and mixing what was a slew of performances, no finished product was ever completed. The reason is that there has been communication problems between the Phoenix family and former members Tim Hankins and Sasa Raphael. Josh Greenbaum and Josh Mckay had readily signed a release form allowing their tracks to be used, hence the early enthusiasm about the potential release of the record. According to Greenbaum, \\"The reason River signed with Island in the first place was because he obviously wanted to get his music out to the world. I just want to see that happen, even if I never see a penny from it. That would make the investment of five years of my life worth it.\\" An original track list for bootlegs of Zero/Never Odd Or Even http://www.aleka.org/phoenix/music.html # Alone We Elope # Below Beloved # Bliss Is... # Dog God # Get Anything # Note To A Friend # Safety Pins and Army Boots # Scales & Fishnails # Senile Felines # You're So Ostentatious In 1997, Phoenix's friend Michael Stipe of R.E.M. bought the rights to all of Aleka's Attic's material from Island Records. Homemade versions of an album and many other songs by the band can be found on various sites throughout the internet.

He is the designer of the Harpoon and Command at Sea gaming systems, and several supplements for the games. Examples of his numerous novels include Dangerous Ground, Day of Wrath, The Enemy Within, Cauldron, Vortex and Red Phoenix. He also co-authored Red Storm Rising with Tom Clancy. Early life and education Bond graduated in 1973 from St. Thomas College in St. Paul, Minnesota, with a degree in Quantitative Methods, and then worked first as a computer programmer for two years before being selected for Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island. He was sworn into the United States Navy in 1975 and graduated from NAVOCS the following year. Career Bond served in the United States Navy for six years, serving four years on a destroyer and two years on shore duty in the Washington, D.C. area. He then served in the reserves for two years with the Naval Reserve Intelligence Program. After leaving the Navy he worked as a naval analyst for defense consulting firms in the Washington, D.C. area. =Early writings= Bond's began his writing career by collaborating with Tom Clancy on Red Storm Rising (1986), a New York Times bestseller that was one of the best-selling books of the 1980s. It depicted a hypothetical conflict between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, drawing heavily on current analysis of what such a conflict would be like. It has been used as a text at the Naval War College and similar institutions. Since then, Bond's books have depicted military and political crises, emphasizing accuracy and fast-paced action. Red Phoenix, Vortex, and Cauldron were all New York Times bestsellers. Red Phoenix is set in South Korea and depicts an invasion of the south instigated by the North Korean government. Vortex tells the story of a reactionary Afrikaner government trying to roll back the clock in South Africa. Cauldron shows a financial crisis in Europe that grew out of control, leading to a military confrontation between France, Germany and countries of the Eastern Europe (Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary) supported by the United States. =Harpoon gaming system= Author Larry Bond at Origins 2018 Bond's Harpoon gaming system was first published in 1980. Designed as a general- purpose air, surface, and submarine naval simulation, it combines playability with a wealth of information on modern naval weapons systems. Designed for the entry-level player, it has found acceptance in both the commercial market and the professional naval community. It is used at the Naval Academy, several ROTC installations, and on several surface ships as a training aid. Now in its fourth edition, Harpoon won the H.G. Wells Award, a trade association honor, in both 1981 and 1987 as the best miniatures game of the year. It is the only game to win the award twice.

The doctrine states that Jesus Christ performed three functions (or \\"offices\\") in his earthly ministry ‚Äì those of prophet (Deuteronomy 18:14-22), priest (Psalm 110:1-4), and king (Psalm 2) In the Old Testament, the appointment of someone to any of these three positions could be sanctioned by anointing him by pouring oil over his head. Thus the term messiah, meaning \\"anointed one\\", is associated with the concept of the threefold office. While the office of king is that most frequently with the Messiah, the role of Jesus as priest, which involves intercession before God, is also prominent in the New Testament, being most fully explained in chapters 7 to 10 of the Book of Hebrews. The three offices Eusebius worked out this threefold classification, writing: \\"And we have been told also that certain of the prophets themselves became, by the act of anointing, Christs in type, so that all these have reference to the true Christ, the divinely inspired and heavenly Word, who is the only high priest of all, and the only King of every creature, and the Father‚Äôs only supreme prophet of prophets.\\"Hist. eccl. 1.3.8, in Philip Schaff, ed., Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Second Series (New York, 1890), 1:86. During the Reformation this concept played a substantial role in scholastic Lutheran Christology and in the christology of Reformed theologians such as John CalvinInstitutes of the Christian Religion, 2.15 as well as that of John Wesley.H. Orton Wiley, Christian Theology Chapter 22 [resource online] (Nampa, Idaho: 1993-2005, accessed 3 June 2006); available from http://wesley.nnu.edu/holiness_tradition/wiley/wiley-2-22.htm The entry in the Evangelical Dictionary of Theology claims that Christian theologians view all the other roles of Christ as falling under one of these three distinctions. = Prophet = Christ is the mouthpiece of God as the Prophet, speaking and teaching the Word of God,Letham 1993, p. 143 infinitely greater than all prophets, who spoke for God and interpreted the will of God.Brown 1986, p. 1107 The Old Testament prophet brought God‚Äôs message to the people. Christ, as the Word ()/Logos is the Source of revelation. Accordingly, Jesus Christ never used the messenger formula, which linked the prophet‚Äôs words to God in the prophetic phrase, Thus says the Lord.LaSor 1996, p. 221-230 Christ, being of the same nature,Rogers1998, p. 175 provides a definitive and true exposition of God. The Word/Logos is Light. As the true Light (), Jesus Christ exclusively enlightens humankind in the office of Prophet. Jesus affirmed his Divine identity and ultimate authority, revealing God to humanity, continuing His work into the future as the Light (). * The Bible refers about the Prophetic nature of Jesus Christ in the following verses: # \\"I have glorified thee on earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.\\" # \\"These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.\\" # \\"Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, A man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know.\\" # But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. # And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent. * In these verses Jesus is not denying his divinity when he says \\"there is none good but one\\". Rather Jesus realized that the young man saw him as an excellent teacher but not as the promised Messiah the \\"Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace\\" of Therefore, instead of seeking to convince the young man that he was the Messiah, Jesus merely corrected the young man's notion of \\"goodness\\" as it pertained to achieving eternal life by stating \\"If thou wilt be perfect...come follow me\\". Thus as the prophet spoken of by Moses in - \\"The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken\\" - Jesus was telling the young man \\"if you would know how to attain eternal life, come follow me and I will show you\\" If in fact the young man had followed Jesus, he would have eventually seen how to obtain eternal life and seen that Jesus truly was the \\"one who was good\\" and would have along with the Apostle Thomas been quite willing to call Jesus \\"My Lord and my God\\". There are several instances in the Bible that suggest that Jesus' contemporaries regarded him as a prophet. After raising the widow's son at Nain in , the witnesses say,\\"A great prophet has arisen among us!\\" In , Jesus is called a prophet by the people who do not recognize him when they say,\\"The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and some of the people\\". = Priest = Icon of \\"Christ the Great High Priest\\", vested as a bishop, on a bishop's cathedra, blessing as a priest Christ, whom believers draw near to in confidence, offered Himself as the sacrifice for humanity as High Priest (). Old Testament priests declared the will of God, gave the covenant of blessing, and directed the processing of sacrifices.Matthews 1993, p.187-198 The priest represented humankind before God. While humankind took the office of priesthood in their weakness, Jesus holds the position with an indestructible power that overcomes the weakness of humanity as described throughout the book of Hebrews.see , , , , ; ; , , , and . As High Priest, Christ became one with humanity in human weakness, offered prayers to God, chose obedience through suffering, and sympathized with the struggles of humanity. The atoning death of Christ is at the heart of His work as High Priest. Metaphors are used to describe His death on the cross, such as, \\"Christ, the Lamb of God, shed His blood on the cross as the sin offering for humankind.\\" Christ made one sin offering as High Priest in contrast to the Old Testament priests, who continually offered sacrifices on behalf of humanity. Because of the work of Christ on the cross, humanity has the opportunity to have a living relationship with God. Conversely, the individuals that deny the work of God are described as dead in sin, without God and without hope. In traditional Christianity (the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican Church, Oriental Orthodox, and Assyrian Churches), it is believed that a priest, having received the Sacrament of Holy Orders through the laying on of hands, shares the one priesthood of Christ, and thus it is only priests who can offer the Eucharistic Sacrifice. = King = Christ, exalted High Priest, mediates the sin that estranges humankind from the fellowship of God. In turn, He has full rights to reign over the church and world as King. Christ sits at the right hand of God, crowned in glory as \\"King of kings and Lord of lords\\". (NRSV). \\"God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church.\\" (NRSV).  Reformed and Presbyterian traditions The Heidelberg Catechism interprets the title \\"Christ\\" in terms of the threefold office, in Lord's Day 12, Question and Answer 31: Q. Why is he called \\"Christ,\\" meaning \\"anointed\\"? A. Because he has been ordained by God the Father ::and has been anointed with the Holy Spirit to be :our chief prophet and teacher ::who perfectly reveals to us ::the secret counsel and will of God for our deliverance; :our only high priest ::who has set us free by the one sacrifice of his body, ::and who continually pleads our cause with the Father; :and our eternal king ::who governs us by his Word and Spirit, ::and who guards us and keeps us ::in the freedom he has won for us. The Westminster Shorter Catechism explains the role of Christ as redeemer in terms of the threefold office: Q. 23: What offices doth Christ execute as our Redeemer? :Christ, as our Redeemer, executeth the offices of a prophet, of a priest, and of a king, both in his estate of humiliation and exaltation. Q. 24: How doth Christ execute the office of a prophet? :Christ executeth the office of a prophet, in revealing to us, by his word and Spirit, the will of God for our salvation. Q. 25: How doth Christ execute the office of a priest? :Christ executeth the office of a priest, in his once offering up of himself a sacrifice to satisfy divine justice, and reconcile us to God, and in making continual intercession for us. Q.26: How doth Christ execute the office of a king? :Christ executeth the office of a king, in subduing us to himself, in ruling and defending us, and in restraining and conquering all his and our enemies. Lutheranism (a) The prophetical office (munus, or officium propheticum) includes teaching and the miracles of Christ. (b) The priestly office (munus sacerdotale) consists of the satisfaction made for the sins of the world by the death on the cross, and in the continued intercession of the exalted Savior for his people (redemptio et intercessio sacerdotalis). (c) The kingly office (munus regium), whereby Christ founded his kingdom, defends his church against all enemies, and rules all things in heaven and on earth. The old divines distinguish between the reign of nature (regnum naturae sive potentiae), which embraces all things; the reign of grace (regnum gratiae), which relates to the church militant on earth; and the reign of glory (regnum gloriae), which belongs to the church triumphant in heaven. The theologians who followed Luther and Melanchthon down to the middle of the seventeenth century treat Christ's saving work under the two heads of king and priest. Calvin, in the first edition of his Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536), did the same, and it was not till the third edition (1559) and the Genevan Catechism that he fully presented the three offices. This convenient threefold division of the office of Christ was used by the theologians of both confessions during the seventeenth century. Ernesti opposed it, but Schleiermacher restored it. Roman Catholicism The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \\"Jesus fulfilled the messianic hope of Israel in his threefold office of priest, prophet, and king.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 436, Ignatius Press, San Francisco, 1994 In his 5th century Gospel harmony book Harmony of the Gospels Saint Augustine viewed the variations in the gospel accounts in terms of the different focuses of the authors on Jesus: Matthew on royalty, Mark on humanity, Luke on priesthood and John on divinity.Christology, Controversy and Community by David G.

The first three chapters were published in magazines from 1933 to 1936. The full book was published in 1937 by Covici Friede. The stories in the book are tales of a boy named Jody Tiflin. The book has four different stories about Jody and his life on his father's California ranch. Other main characters include Carl Tiflin ‚Äì Jody's father; Billy Buck ‚Äì an expert in horses and a working hand on the ranch; Mrs. Tiflin ‚Äì Jody's mother; Jody's grandfather ‚Äì Mrs. Tiflin's father, who has a history of crossing the Oregon Trail, and enjoys telling stories about his experiences; and Gitano ‚Äì an old man who wishes to die at the Tiflin ranch. Along with these stories, there is a short story (taken from one of Steinbeck's earlier works, The Pastures of Heaven) at the end of the book titled \\"Junius Maltby\\". However, this last story is omitted in the edition published by Penguin Books. The book's action begins when Carl Tiflin gives his son Jody a red pony colt. Overjoyed, Jody quickly agrees to all of the conditions his father places on the gift (to feed the pony, to clean his stall, etc.). Jody is so awed at the pony's magnificence that he decides to name him Gabilan, after the grassy and oak- dotted Gabilan Mountains that border the Salinas Valley ranch. After several weeks of training and getting to know Gabilan, Jody is told by his father that he will be allowed to ride the horse by Thanksgiving. Though the ranch hand Billy Buck assures him there would be no rain, the pony is caught in a downpour and catches what appears to be a cold after being left out to corral. Billy tries to cure the horse of its illness to no avail and finally diagnoses the illness as strangles, placing a steaming wet bag over the pony's muzzle and entrusting Jody to watch the pony. In the night, Jody becomes sleepy in spite of his constant worry and drifts off to sleep, forgetting about the open barn door. By the time he awakens, the pony has wandered out of the barn. When Billy arrives, he deems it necessary to cut a hole in the horse's windpipe so he can breathe. Jody stays by his side, constantly swabbing out the mucus that clogged the windpipe. After falling asleep, Jody dreams of increasingly powerful winds and wakes up to see that the pony is gone again. Following the pony's trail he then notices a cloud of buzzards circling over a nearby spot. Unable to reach the horse in time, he arrives while a buzzard is eating the horse's eye. In his rage, Jody wrestles with the bird and beats it repeatedly, not stopping until he is pulled off by Billy Buck and his father, though the bird had long since died. The story overall deals with ideas regarding the fallibilities of adults and the entrance into manhood, and the inevitability of death for all living things.

He looks at the great mountains, wishing he could explore them. Suddenly, an old Mexican man named Gitano appears, claiming he was born on the ranch. Gitano requests to stay on the farm until he dies. Carl Tiflin refuses, although he does allow him to stay the night, noting that the old man is very similar to his useless old horse, Easter. That night, Jody secretly visits Gitano. He is polishing his old rapier. Jody asks if he has ever been to the great mountains, and Gitano says he has but remembers little. The next morning Gitano is gone, as is Easter. Jody searches the old man's things, but is disappointed to find no trace of the sharp sword. A neighbor reports seeing Gitano riding the missing horse into the mountains with something in his hand. The adults assume that this is a gun but, as Jody seems to know, it is most likely the rapier. Jody's father wonders why the man has gone into the mountains and jokes that he saved him the trouble of burying the old horse. The story ends with Jody filled with longing and sorrow at thoughts of the old man, the rapier, and the mountains. \\"The Great Mountains\\" was first published in the December 1933 issue of North American Review. = Chapter 3 ‚Äì The Promise = Carl Tiflin thinks it is time for Jody to learn more responsibility, so he arranges for Jody to take the mare Nellie to be serviced at a neighbor's farm. The stud fee is five dollars and Jody works hard all summer to satisfy the five dollar credit his father held over him. After a few months, Billy Buck determines Nellie is pregnant. While Jody and Billy take care of the mare, Billy states that his mother died in childbirth and he was raised on mares' milk. That's why Billy is supposed to be so good with horses. Jody dreams often about his coming foal. Billy explains that mares are more delicate than cattle and sometimes the foal has to be torn to pieces and removed to save the mare's life. This worries Jody. He thinks of his pony Gabilan, who died of strangles. Billy failed to cure the pony, and now Jody worries something will happen to Nellie. This doubt also assails Billy, who is insistent on not failing the boy again, both for Jody and his own pride. Jody wakes up in the middle of the night.Steinbeck, p.74 He dreams of all the possible things that could go wrong with Nellie's pregnancy, hoping none of them would come true. Then, \\"he [slips] his clothes on\\"Steinbeck, p.75 and sneaks out to the barn to check on Nellie. When Jody catches sight of Nellie, \\"She [does] not stop her swaying nor look around.\\" Before Jody can try to return to sleep again, Billy Buck frantically tells everyone that Nellie is ready to give birth. Billy Buck kneels down to her and realizes that \\"It's wrong\\"Steinbeck, p.77 and that he \\"can't turn [the colt]\\". Billy Buck orders Jody to \\"turn [his] face\\". Billy Buck then hits Nellie over the head and performs a cesarean section on Nellie to deliver the promised colt to Jody. Billy then asks for Jody's help in caring for the new animal, and Jody goes to the house, but the image of Nellie and the bloody foal still linger in his mind. \\"The Promise\\" was first published in the October 1937 issue of Harper's Monthly. =Chapter 4 ‚Äì The Leader of the People= Jody's grandfather comes to visit. Carl Tiflin complains about how his father-in-law is constantly re-telling the same stories about leading a wagon train across the plains. Mrs. Tiflin and Billy, however, believe he's earned the right to tell of his adventures, and Jody is delighted to hear them no matter how many times. The morning after his arrival, Carl Tiflin complains about Grandfather's stories at the breakfast table: \\"Why can't he forget it, now it's done?...He came across the plains. All right! Now it's finished. Nobody wants to hear about it over and over.\\" At that moment Grandfather walks into the room. Afterwards Jody's grandfather becomes melancholic. He acknowledges that his stories may be tiresome, but explains: Jody, attempting to console his weary, nostalgic, and heartbroken grandfather, tells him that he wants to be a leader as well. The story ends with Jody preparing a lemonade for his grandfather, allowed to do so by his mother after she realizes he is acting out of genuine sympathy, not in an effort to win himself a treat. \\"The Leader of the People\\" was first published in the August 1936 issue of Argosy. =Junius Maltby= The short story concerns a man named Junius Maltby, who, dissatisfied with his life as an accountant in San Francisco, finally breaks with that life on the advice of his doctor, who recommends drier weather for his respiratory illness. Junius, in fairer climate, takes boarding with a widow and her children in his convalescence. After some time, with the townsfolk beginning to talk about the single man living so long with the widow, Junius promptly marries his landlord and becomes the head of the well- kept, profitable ranch/farm. The widow releases her working man and tries to put Junius to work on the farmstead, but Junius, having become accustomed to a life of leisure, ignores his duties. Eventually the farm falls into disrepair, the family goes broke, and without enough food or clothes, the widow and her children succumb to disease. Only Junius and his lone son by the widow survive. Junius, with his barefoot child and a hired servant as lazy as he, spends his time reading books and having fanciful discussions with his companions, never actually working. Because of this, his son is raised in rags, though well trained to independent thought and flights of the imagination. Despite his appearance and the intention of the other children to torment him, the child is well received at school and indeed becomes a leader of the children. So influenced by him are they, the other children begin to spurn their shoes and tear holes in their clothes. Except for the teacher, who finds the man and his son to be romantically dignified, the rest of the community has nothing but scorn for Junius and sympathy for his child. The story ends with members of the school board attempting to give the child some shoes and new clothes as a present. Upon realizing the regard in which he is held by society, he loses the last of his innocence and becomes ashamed, realizing for the first time that he is poor. The last scene has the sympathetic teacher see Junius and his son, cleaned and well dressed though painfully so, on their way back to San Francisco where Junius will go back to dull work and ill-health in order to provide for his unwilling son. Adaptations In 1949 Lewis Milestone produced and directed a motion picture named \\"The Red Pony\\" for Republic Pictures, in Technicolor, starring Myrna Loy, Robert Mitchum, and child actor Peter Miles. The music for the movie was composed by Aaron Copland, who also arranged a suite for orchestra from the film score. Copland recorded this music for Columbia Records in London in 1975. Another film version was made for television in 1973, starring Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara. Jerry Goldsmith won his first Emmy for the score, which was released in a limited edition by Var√®se Sarabande in 2012. Reception Billboard complimented the novel by stating that \\"The Red Pony, [by] John Steinbeck, [is a] wrenching story of adolescent initiation into the world of death, birth, and disappointment.\\" References Further reading *Steinbeck's \\"The Red Pony\\": Essays in Criticism, edited by Tetsumaro Hayashi and Thomas J.

They primarily grow in rivers and streams, but can also be found in marshes. They are characterized by broad, thick, dark leaves that come in many different forms. The genus was revised in 1979 and since then its nomenclature has been stable. Species can be determined by using mostly characteristics of the inflorescence. Because of the often shady places where the plants grow, the genus was named after the Egyptian god Anubis, the god of the afterlife. The genus was first described in 1857 by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott, with A. afzelii as its type species.  Reproduction and uses  Anubias, most notably the varying forms of A. barteri, are commonly used in aquariums, usually attached to rocks or bogwood. In contrast to most plants, Anubias generally prefer subdued lighting and can also produce flowers underwater. In the aquarium they should be placed in shaded areas, otherwise algae will develop on the leaves. Anubias are considered by many aquarists some of the easiest plants to maintain, since their light and nutrient requirements are very low and also because herbivorous fish will not eat it (with a few exceptions). This is why Anubias are some of the few plants which can be used in aquariums with African cichlids and goldfishes. Reproduction in artificial environments can be accomplished by stolon division or from side shoots. The stolon must always be above the substrate in order to survive, otherwise it will rot and the plant dies. Rather than planting anubias directly into the soil, they should be attached to a piece of rock or driftwood, as they are more likely to grow and thrive when the rhizome and roots are left exposed instead of buried. It is also possible to propagate Anubias by seed. The natural growth rate of all species in this genus is rather slow. Usually, they produce a leaf every 3 weeks, or even slower. And while they were once thought to be among the few plants that do not respond to CO2 addition, . The most commonly available species of this genus is Anubias barteri Schott, which is polymorphic and subdivided into several varieties. The largest members of the genus are Anubias gigantea Chevalier ex Hutchinson and Anubias heterophylla Engler. Their leaf-stems can grow up to 83 cm, with leaves 40 cm long and 14 cm broad with lateral lobes up to 28 cm long and 10 cm broad. The smallest representative is Anubias barteri var. nana (Engler) Crusio, with a height up to 10 cm and with leaves up to 6 cm long and 3 cm broad. Anubias can be grown emersed (above water). For this reason they may be used in paludariums.

Career Born in Newark, New Jersey, to Dr. Samuel Ashbel Farrand, headmaster of the historic Newark Academy, and Rachel Louise (Wilson) Farrand, Farrand received an undergraduate degree from Princeton in 1888, and went on to the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he earned his M.D. in 1891. He attended the Universities of Cambridge and Berlin. After graduating in 1893, he went on to serve as adjunct Professor of psychology at Columbia and after joining Franz Boas on expeditions to the Pacific Northwest (notably, the Jesup North Pacific Expedition) he became a full professor of anthropology in 1903, where he served until 1914. He became executive secretary of the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis in 1905 and then in 1914 became president of the University of Colorado, and held that position until 1919. From 1912 to 1914, he was treasurer of the American Public Health Association, during the same period editing the American Journal of Public Health. During World War I he was director in France of the International Health Board, 1917-19. His public health work led to his appointment as Chairman the Central Committee of the American Red Cross and he worked to fight tuberculosis for the Rockefeller Foundation in France in 1917. In 1921, he became the fourth president of Cornell University. Under his leadership, Cornell's enrollment and endowment increased rapidly. He also expanded Cornell-in-China with the University of Nanking and in 1931 saw the arrival in Ithaca of students from the Soviet Union. The unified College of Engineering was created as was the College of Home Economics. In 1929, he declined to intervene on behalf of two students who had been denied residency in the women's dormitories at Sage Hall on the basis of their race. In reply to a letter from the mother of one of these women, he wrote, \\"... while I have great sympathy for your feeling, I cannot order a change in the procedure of the Dean of Women, under whose jurisdiction the matter falls\\" He contributed many articles to psychological and anthropological publications; his articles treat principally of the anthropology of American Indians. In 1904, he wrote Basis of American History. Family Livingston was the brother of Max Farrand, Professor of History at Stanford University and Yale University. Max's wife was landscape architect Beatrix Farrand.

He then returned to rugby league, playing in the Super League for Crusaders RL and the London Broncos. Witt then played one more season in Australia for the St. George Illawarra Dragons. Background Growing up in Toowoomba, Queensland, Witt attended Harristown State High School where he was a champion junior boxer and played rugby league for the Newtown Lions in the local junior competition, and he later went on to represent Queensland in rugby league at the Under 15 level in 1999 and the Under 16 level in 2000. During 1999 he was spotted by the Parramatta Eels as a player with much potential and he was offered a scholarship by the club, which he accepted, and in the following year he moved to Sydney to join his older brother Steven at Parramatta, where he spent the next three seasons in the lower grades. During the 2002 season, Witt played in the SG Ball Grand Final, where his Parramatta team was defeated 18-16 by the Western Suburbs Magpies. When Parramatta's regular halfback Paul Green was injured (causing his retirement from the game), Witt was promoted to the team as Green's replacement to make his National Rugby League d√©but on 2 May 2003. Despite a very promising d√©but from Witt, Parramatta were soundly beaten 44-12 by the Sydney Roosters in a Friday night game at Parramatta Stadium. Professional playing career =Parramatta Eels= Before Witt's debut, Parramatta had won just two games from seven in 2003, and were looking very likely to be out of the semi finals race very early on in the season. But Witt sparked the disappointing Eels to life, and the team won ten from their last fourteen games of the season to narrowly miss qualifying for the semi finals. In one of his early games in the NRL he encountered extreme disappointment in missing two crucial, but easy (by his standards) goals which saw Parramatta lose narrowly 18‚Äì16 to the New Zealand Warriors. On The Michael Witt Story that aired on The NRL Footy Show later that year, Witt admitted that he felt like he had let the whole Parramatta organisation down with those missed attempts at goal, but he soon quickly overcame this early setback to become one of the form players in the NRL with many commentators impressed with his maturity and the sharpness of his skills. Some of the highlights of his first season included the sideline conversion to seal Parramatta's come-from-behind victory over the North Queensland Cowboys at Parramatta Stadium, and his first half effort against the South Sydney Rabbitohs at Aussie Stadium, where his two classy tries set up Parramatta's easy 34‚Äì20 win. Witt scored a haul of 18 points in that match, and was Parramatta's leading pointscorer in 2003 with 104 points from three tries, 45 goals and two field goals. His great first season in the NRL saw him win Parramatta's Rookie of the Year award as well as being selected in the New South Wales Under 19 team to play Queensland in an interstate representative match. Unfortunately though for Witt, a shoulder injury prevented him from playing. He was also among the main contenders for the prestigious Dally M Rookie of the Year award, which was won by the Melbourne Storm's Billy Slater. Witt was rewarded for his great form with a new, lucrative four-year contract to stay with Parramatta. 2004 started promisingly with Witt being named in the emerging Queensland State of Origin squad in the early part of the season. However, he was very surprisingly not selected in first grade until Round 12, despite Parramatta's very poor form until that time and calls from many fans for him to be selected, wondering why Parramatta's Rookie of the Year just twelve months previously now seemed to be out of favour with Parramatta coach Brian Smith. Witt's return sparked a limited recovery for Parramatta, which included an upset 26‚Äì12 victory over eventual Grand Finalists the Sydney Roosters, with Witt's pinpoint accurate bombs resulting in three tries for winger Luke Burt. But the Eels finished well down the ladder with just nine wins to finish 12th. Adding to the disappointment was Witt receiving a two- week suspension for a dangerous throw in a game against the Newcastle Knights in June. But the most disappointing occurrence of 2004 happened post season, when Parramatta announced that Witt was \\"not in their first grade plans\\" for 2005, despite him having another three years to go on his contract. This came just weeks after he turned in a supreme effort against the New Zealand Warriors where he scored 24 points from two tries and eight goals in a 48‚Äì18 win at Parramatta Stadium, and had scored 72 points from three tries and 30 goals in his limited appearances during the course of the season. However, upon his release by Parramatta, Witt was very quickly signed by the Manly- Warringah Sea Eagles as part of their impressive build-up for the 2005 season and during the 2004-05 off season, Witt employed the tutoring of Australian soccer great Graham Arnold to further finesse his goalkicking talents. =Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles= Witt, along with fellow blue chip signings Ben Kennedy and Brent Kite, added much needed player strength at Manly in 2005 and the club qualified for its first semi finals series since 1998 and finished in eighth position. For the first half of the season Manly was among the dominant teams of the NRL, and Witt's form correspondingly at five-eighth was some of the best of his career to date, prompting Manly officials to publicly thank Parramatta for releasing him. Among the highlights were excellent performances in the victories over eventual Premiers Wests Tigers and in the amazing come-from-behind win against the Penrith Panthers. Penrith led 26-6 early in the second half, before a Witt-inspired Manly team powered home to win 36‚Äì26 at Brookvale Oval. Also during this period, Witt kicked 20 successive goals without a miss. However, Manly found wins hard to come by in the second half of the season, and Witt experienced the same frustrations that plagued his 2004. In a match in July against the Wests Tigers, he received a one-week suspension for striking Liam Fulton. And after a disappointing 36‚Äì10 loss to the St George Illawarra Dragons a few weeks later, Witt was dropped from the first grade squad after being targeted by the big Dragons forwards due to his perceived defensive deficiencies. Manly coach Des Hasler used a number of forwards at five-eighth in subsequent games, but with very little success, and Witt was drafted back into the side for the semi final against Parramatta. Despite Manly being hopelessly outclassed 46‚Äì22 to be eliminated, Witt sent the crowd alight by scoring one of the best tries of 2005, as he weaved through the Parramatta defence and sprinted fifty metres to score under the posts. However, this great moment was marred by yet another two-week suspension, this time for a high tackle on Eels Mark Riddell. Witt was among the leading pointscorers in the NRL for 2005, scoring 140 points from five tries and 60 goals from 19 appearances. With Witt's two match suspension ruling him ineligible in Manly's two NRL-sanctioned pre-season trial matches for 2006, unproven rookie Travis Burns was able to take advantage of his absence and was preferred by coach Des Hasler as Manly's regular five-eighth for the season (despite Witt being the incumbent in that position at the end of 2005), and Witt was given only one start in first grade for the year against Newcastle in Round 17 (following Burns' suspension for one week). Witt performed very credibly in his only appearance, despite Manly's 26‚Äì12 loss at Brookvale Oval. Starting the year in the NSWRL Premier League, Witt's class shone even further in lesser company, playing at both five-eighth and halfback and helping Manly to a number of large victories, with the team finishing fourth and just missed qualifying for the Grand Final. This strong form throughout 2006 led to Witt's selection at five-eighth for the NSW Residents team to play Queensland Residents in a representative match played prior to the third State of Origin match at the Telstra Dome in Melbourne, where Witt steered NSW Residents to a comfortable 28‚Äì20 win. He was also the first player in the Premier League competition to score 100 points for the season, a mark he reached in early May, and finished the year with 256 points from 17 tries and 94 goals. As opportunities at Manly became increasingly limited, Witt signed with the New Zealand Warriors for the 2007 season on a one-year contract.Trio of Signings announced by Vodafone Warriors Warriors Official Site =New Zealand Warriors= Witt arrived at his new club in November 2006 determined to re-establish himself as a regular NRL player after the lean season he'd just had at Manly, and strong performances in the three trial matches at five-eighth saw Witt earn a spot for the opening round game for 2007 against Parramatta, where the Warriors eased to a resounding 34‚Äì18 win. In the following weeks, the Warriors continued their year in impressive fashion, winning five of their first seven games with the fifth win coming in the final seconds against South Sydney courtesy of a radar-like controlled kick from Witt that set up a try for winger Todd Byrne. Witt settled in well within the team and his good early season form impressed club officials enough to quickly extend his contract from the original one-year deal to the end of 2009.Witt a Warrior to 2009 The Daily Telegraph, 24 April 2007 Following this win against the Rabbitohs though the Warriors fell into a slump, losing their next five games with Witt being briefly shifted to halfback after the regular no.7 Grant Rovelli was dropped for poor form. Also during this losing streak Witt received a one-week suspension for a dangerous throw on Misi Taulapapa in the Warriors' narrow loss to Cronulla at Mount Smart Stadium. With the Warriors' designated kicker Tony Martin being left out of the team that round, Witt assumed the kicking duties. While Tony Martin was back the following week against Penrith, he was injured early in the game, and Witt again assumed the role of goalkicker (and for rest of the season) and finished the game with 20 points from two tries and six goals (his biggest haul in a game since 2005). After landing eight goals from eight attempts, his unbroken run of successful goals in the NRL competition grew to 25 (stretching back to his only first grade appearance in 2006), and was only 10 short of the record set by Bulldogs winger, Hazem El Masri. However Witt's run ended a week later against the Wests Tigers at 28, after missing a conversion from out wide. By this time, the Warriors were well ensconced in the top eight, and they qualified for the finals well placed in fourth position. However successive losses in the finals to Parramatta and North Queensland ended the Warriors' hopes for 2007. Also during 2007, Witt broke Daryl Halligan's record for the best success rate in a season, with his kicking percentage for the year being 92.5% (62 goals from 67 attempts). The previous record set by Halligan was 87.1% in 2000. Season 2008 started slowly for the Warriors and Witt, and Witt turned in arguably his worst performance of his career in Round 3 as the Warriors were crushed 52-6 by eventual premiers Manly at Brookvale Oval.Manly run riot to hammer Warriors 52-6 Sydney Morning Herald, 31 March 2008 But the Warriors recovered to win 3 of their next 5 games before Witt badly damaged his hip while attempting a penalty goal against the Canberra Raiders which sidelined him for the next four games. Witt struggled on his return and was dropped after two games, however the Warriors' mid season slump failed to be halted with new halves Nathan Fien and Grant Rovelli, and following a narrow loss to last placed South Sydney on which goalkicking was decisive, Witt returned for the Round 22 game against the Brisbane Broncos on which the team began a remarkable surge towards the semi finals to finish in 8th position, setting up a sudden death Qualifying Final match against the Melbourne Storm at Olympic Park Stadium. Few gave the eighth-placed Warriors much hope against the minor premiers, especially as no eighth team had ever beaten first since the McIntyre system was introduced in 1999. However the Warriors fought all the way, and with just minutes remaining only trailed 14‚Äì15. Suddenly Manu Vatuvei made a break down field, finding Witt in support who taunted the Melbourne defenders by waving the ball in the air before placing it down to give the Warriors a shock 18‚Äì15 win.League: Warriors defy history to shock Storm New Zealand Herald, 14 September 2008 The Warriors backed the win up with a comfortable 30‚Äì13 win over the Sydney Roosters in the Semi Final at Mount Smart Stadium before being eliminated 32-6 by Manly in the Preliminary Final at the Sydney Football Stadium. In 2009 Witt was expected to face competition for the Five Eighth spot from new signing Joel Moon. The Warriors strangely told him that they didn't expect to use him in 2009, and he would instead he probably spend the season playing in the NSW Cup for the Auckland Vulcans. This led Witt to look for a new club and he was linked with the Penrith Panthers and Melbourne Storm before he finally decided to switch codes. =Rugby union= In March 2009 Witt switched to rugby union, signing with the New Zealand Rugby Union and the Otago Rugby Union. He played in the Air New Zealand Cup in 2009 . Witt has said he aims to playing international rugby for the All Blacks.Warrior Michael Witt eyes All Black jersey Herald Sun, 24 March 2009 Witt played for the Taieri Eels in Dunedin Club Competition before making the Otago squad.Michael Witt Makes His First Appearance For The Taieri Eels Channel 9, 20 April 2009 He made his d√©but for Otago in a July pre-season match. He went on to play seven games in the Air New Zealand Cup, six of them from the bench, and kicked one penalty goal.Witt signs with Super League club NRL.com, 7 December 2009 =St George Illawarra Dragons= In December 2009 it was announced that Witt had decided to return to rugby league, signing with Wales-based Super League club Crusaders. On 29 January, Witt scored Crusaders first points of 2010, and the first points of 2010's Super League XV with a penalty kick in their 34‚Äì6 loss to Leeds Rhinos. Midway through the Super League season, Witt was considered a top contender for player of the year. However, his season was cut short by an injury to his knee. On 30 June 2011, Witt signed a new 3-year deal keeping him at Crusaders until the end of the 2014 season. However, following the demise of the Crusaders, Witt joined the London Broncos, starting in 2012.Mellars makes Wildcats move rleague.com, 1 August 2011 Witt signed with the St. George Illawarra Dragons for 2014. He played the first 4 games before being injured. By the time he returned, the Dragons had signed Benji Marshall and Witt did not play another game. He retired at the end of the season. Modelling and charity work Witt's boy next door good looks have seen him appear in various rugby league charity calendars and magazines. In late 2005, Witt was photographed at the Radisson Kestrel Hotel, Manly (now the Manly Sebel) for the League Of Their Own 2006 calendar that was produced in the style of the famous Dieux du Stade calendars to raise money for the Koori Kids foundation, and following this Witt was included in Cosmopolitan magazine's Boys With Balls '06 feature which profiled 20 of the sexiest footballers of the year from both the NRL and AFL competitions. He was also the male centrefold for the November 2006 issue of Cleo magazine, and was featured on the front cover of the Naked Rugby League 2007-08 charity calendar (and for February 2007) with proceeds from its sales going to the National Breast Cancer Foundation of Australia.Footy fever over nude pics Sydney Morning Herald, 27 September 2006 Witt was also a finalist in the 2007 Adidas Action 3 Sexiest Man in League competition, which was won by Manly fullback Brett Stewart following a public online and SMS vote, and was featured for January for the accompanying Sexiest Man In League 2008 calendar.

It is Alabama's oldest and largest inpatient psychiatric facility. First known as the Alabama State Hospital for the Insane and later as the Alabama Insane Hospital, the building is considered an architectural model.Carla Yanni, The Architecture of Madness: Insane Asylums in the United States, Minneapolis: Minnesota University Press, 2007, 59-64 The hospital currently houses 268 beds for acute care, treatment and rehabilitation of full-time (committed) patients. The Mary Starke Harper Geriatric Psychiatry Hospital, a separate facility on the same campus, provides an additional 100 beds for inpatient geriatric care. The main facility was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History The plans for a state hospital for the mentally ill in Alabama began in 1852. The new facility was planned from the start to utilize the \\"moral architecture\\" concepts of 1830s activists Thomas Story Kirkbride and Dorothea Dix. Dix's reformist ideas, in particular, are credited as the driving force behind the construction of the hospital. Architect Samuel Sloan designed the Italianate building using the Kirkbride Plan. Construction of the building began in 1853 but was not completed until 1859. The hospital was the first building in Tuscaloosa with gas lighting and central heat, \\"all clad in a fashionable Italianate exterior.\\" The Alabama Insane Hospital opened in 1861. It was later renamed for its first superintendent, Peter Bryce, who had first begun as a 27-year-old psychiatric pioneer from South Carolina. Bryce had been brought to the attention of the hospital trustees by Dix. He had studied mental-health care in Europe and worked in psychiatric hospitals in New Jersey, as well as his native state of South Carolina. His tenure was marked by absolute discipline among the staff of the hospital. He demanded that patients be given courtesy, kindness and respect at all times. The use of shackles, straitjackets and other restraints was discouraged, and finally abandoned altogether in 1882. Various work programs and other activities were encouraged, including farming, sewing, maintenance and crafts. Between 1872 and the early 1880s, some of the patients wrote and edited their own newspaper, called The Meteor. These writings provide a rare inside look at life in a progressive mental institution in the late 19th century. At that time, Bryce's management and commitment to \\"scientific treatments\\" was recognized around the country as being in a class of its own. Decline During the 20th century, the patient population expanded while standards of care fell to abysmal levels. Alabama Governor Lurleen Wallace viewed the facility in February 1967, and was moved to tears after an overweight, mentally challenged nine-year-old attempted to hug her, crying, \\"Mama! Mama!\\" She lobbied her husband, George Wallace (who held the actual power of her governorship) for more funds for the institution. In 1970, Alabama ranked last among U.S. states in funding for mental health. Bryce Hospital at that time had 5,200 patients living in conditions that a Montgomery Advertiser editor likened to a concentration camp. That same year, a cigarette tax earmarked for mental-health treatment was cut. One hundred Bryce employees were laid off, including twenty professional staff. Members of the Department of Psychology at the University of Alabama attempted to file suit on behalf of the laid-off workers, but Federal Judge Frank M. Johnson ruled that the courts had no standing to intervene on behalf of fired employees. He left open, however, the possibility of a suit filed on behalf of patients, whose quality of care was affected. Wyatt v. Stickney In October 1970, Ricky Wyatt, a fifteen-year-old who had always been labeled a \\"juvenile delinquent\\" and housed at Bryce despite not being indicated with a mental illness, became the named plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit. His aunt, W. C. Rawlins, was one of the employees who had been laid off. Together they testified about intolerable conditions and improper treatments designed only to make the patients more manageable. In 1971 the plaintiff class was expanded to include patients at Alabama's two other inpatient mental health facilities, Searcy Hospital (Mt. Vernon) and Camp Partlow (Coker). The resulting court- ordered agreements formed the basis for federal minimum standards for the care of people with mental illness or mental retardations who reside in institutional settings. In 1999 a new settlement agreement was made, recognizing a great deal of progress. The case was finally dismissed on December 5, 2003, with the finding by Judge Myron Thompson that Alabama was in compliance with the agreement. The standards elaborated in that agreement have served as a model nationwide. Known as the \\"Wyatt Standards,\\" they are founded on four criteria for evaluation of care: * Humane psychological and physical environment * Qualified and sufficient staff for administration of treatment * Individualized treatment plans * Minimum restriction of patient freedom. The case of Wyatt v. Stickney came to a conclusion after 33 years, through the tenure of nine Alabama governors and fourteen state mental health commissioners, the longest mental health case in national history. The State of Alabama estimates its litigation expenses at over $15 million. Future of Bryce Hospital Gov. Bob Riley announced on December 30, 2009 that Bryce Hospital was to relocate into a newly constructed facility across McFarland Boulevard in Tuscaloosa, and the University of Alabama would take over the current Bryce campus. For several years the university had sought the parcel of land, which is adjacent to its landlocked campus.Bryce Hospital to remain in Tuscaloosa, Riley said that a hospital for about 268 patients had been envisioned but the final size was yet to be determined. The deal, approved by Gov. Bob Riley and the Alabama Department of Mental Health on December 30, 2009 was worth $72 million in cash for Mental Health to build a replacement hospital. The university will pay $50 million in cash and Mental Health will get another $22 million in state bond money. The university pledged another $10 million to clean up environmental problems on the Bryce grounds and restore the main hospital building, construction of which started in 1853. The sale of Bryce Hospital and Harper Center to UA was finalized on May 27, 2010 at a price of $87.75 million. $77 million would go to installments plus the aforementioned $10 million for ground improvements.http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/05/88_million_sale_of_bryce_hospi.html November 5, 2017 In 2014, the remaining patients were moved to a new facility and UA began a restoration project estimated at $40 million. Dan Wolfe, University of Alabama planner, revealed the two buildings will house a welcome center, two museums focusing on mental health and the history of the university, event space and classrooms for performing arts students. The project is expected to be complete by 2020.http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2016/06/inside_the_spooky_skeleton_of.html November 5, 2017 Gallery File:Bryce Hospital by Highsmith 06.jpgEntrance gate to the campus File:Bryce State Hospital Tuscaloosa Alabama USA.jpgDetail of front portico on the Administration Building Image:Brycehospital.jpgA postcard depicting Bryce Hospital around the turn of the 20th century Image:Bryceh1.jpgAbandoned building on the campus Image:Bryceh4.jpgAdmission building, where most patients are located See also * * Alabama Department of Mental Health * Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law * The Meteor, an internal paper published by the residents of Bryce Hospital between 1872 and 1881.

F. O'Rahilly in 1946. It was based on his study of the influences on the Irish language and a critical analysis of Irish mythology. He distinguished four separate waves of Celtic invaders: * The Cruithne or Priteni (c. 700 - 500 BC) * The Builg or √ârainn/Iverni (c. 500 BC) * The Laigin, Fir Domnann and G√°lioin (c. 300 BC) * The Goidels or Gaels (c. 100 BC) O'Rahilly's work was and remains influential but much of his linguistic work has since been refuted by noted authors such as Kenneth H. Jackson and John T. Koch and is not generally the accepted model. Irish archaeologists have fairly consistently failed to support the theory, as archaeological evidence of these waves of settlement is lacking. The Pretanic colonisation According to O'Rahilly's model, between 700 and 500 BC, iron-wielding, Celtic-speaking people first settled in Great Britain and Ireland from the continent. They spoke a Brittonic language and called themselves Priteni or Pritani. The impact they had upon the native inhabitants can be inferred from the fact that Greek geographers were referring to these islands as the ‚ÄúPretanic Islands‚Äù () by at least 300 BC. It is also possible that the very name ‚ÄúBritain‚Äù is derived from Priteni. However, there is no hard evidence for a Pretanic invasion as such. It is much more likely that their settlement of these islands was a gradual one, spread over several centuries. In Britain, these Priteni were absorbed by later invaders and lost their cultural identity, except in the far north where they were known to the Romans as the Picti \\"painted people\\", on account of their practice of decorating their bodies with tattoos (a practice which by then had died out among other Celtic nations). In Ireland, too, the Priteni were largely absorbed by later settlers; but a few pockets of them managed to retain a measure of cultural, if not political, independence well into the Christian era. By then they were identified as Cruithne, a Goidelic adaptation of the Brittonic word Priteni. Both words are derived from a root meaning ‚Äúto shape‚Äù or ‚Äúcreate.‚Äù Celtic tribes generally gave themselves names which were the pluralised forms of names they gave to their deities (in this case ‚Äúthe Creator‚Äù). Among the Cruthin tribes that survived into the Christian era the most prominent were the D√°l nAraidi in Ulster, and the Lo√≠ges and Fothairt in Leinster. The name of the second of these tribes, modernized as Laois, has been revived and given to County Laois, Leinster (formerly \\"Queen's County\\"). The Bolgic or Ernean invasion Around 500 BC the Cruthin lost their dominant position in Irish society when the country was invaded by a second wave of P-Celtic speakers. These were the Builg or √ârainn. The former name (originally Bolgi) identifies them as Belgae, a Celtic people mentioned by Julius Caesar in Commentarii de Bello Gallico. Their other name, originally Iverni, is probably the origin of several of the early Classical names for Ireland: the Greek ŒôŒµœÅŒΩŒ∑; ŒôŒøœÖŒµœÅŒΩŒπŒ± and possibly also the Latin Hibernia. In Irish mythology, the name Fir Bolg obviously refers to the same people. It appears that groups of these Belgae colonised Britain and Ireland in the late sixth or early fifth century. In both islands they absorbed and subjugated most of the previous inhabitants. Among the more prominent Ernean tribes were the following: *The Uluti (Middle Irish: Ulaid), after whom Ulster is named. For centuries the Uluti were the dominant tribe in the north of the country. They founded Navan Fort, the traditional capital of Ulster, near Armagh. In later historical times their descendants were known as the D√°l Fiatach and were confined to the eastern half of County Down. *The Darini and Robogdii (or Reidodioi), two tribes whose territory was in Antrim and north Down. They were probably the ancestors of the historical D√°l Riata or D√°l Riada, who colonised Scotland in the 5th century of the common era and from whom the kings of Scotland were descended. *The Iverni, the dominant Ernean tribe in Munster from whom the √ârainn as a whole took their name. The Corcu Lo√≠gde of historical times were their descendants. * The Ebdani, a tribe of the east coast whose name appears as Eblani in Ptolemy's description of Ireland in his Geography. He calls their settlement Eblana. The Laginian invasion According to O'Rahilly, about two centuries after the Bolgic invasion, Ireland was subjected to another invasion of Brittonic speakers. Three names can be distinguished for them, but whether they were one tribe with three different names or three closely allied but separate tribes we cannot say. These names, as given in later written records, are Laigin, Domnainn and G√°lioin. According to their own traditions, they came to Ireland from Armorica (Brittany). They landed in the southeast of the country and took the southeastern quarter from the √ârainn. The modern name of this province, Leinster (Irish: Laighin), preserves the memory of this Laginian conquest, although in ancient times it was much smaller than the modern province. Before the Goidelic invasion, the River Liffey marked the boundary between Ulster and Leinster. The Domnainn were clearly a branch of the Dumnonii, a Celtic people identified by Classical authors as inhabiting Dumnonia (the English counties of Cornwall and Devon, to which they gave their name). Another branch of the Dumnonii settled in Scotland, where they founded Dumbarton and established the kingdom later known as Strathclyde. Presumably these settlements occurred at around the same time as the Laginian invasion of Ireland. It is even possible that the Dumnonii of Scotland were originally Irish Domnainn. The Laginian invasion made little impact in Ulster or Munster, where Ernean tribes continued to be the dominant force. But the same cannot be said for Connacht, the westernmost of the four provinces. Sometime in the third century (all these dates are highly conjectural) they crossed the River Shannon and subjugated the Ernean tribes of Connacht. The decisive battle, the Cath Maige Tuired, was fought in County Sligo in a place called Mag Tuired. There a Laginian king (possibly known as Cairbre) overthrew the √ârainn and drove them out of Connacht. According to Irish records the defeated √ârainn sought refuge in many of the islands around Ireland. The fortresses of D√∫n Aonghasa and D√∫n Conor on the Aran Islands, and D√∫n Balor on Tory Island, are thought to have been built by them. O'Rahilly claims that it was probably as a result of the Laginian conquests that Ireland first came to be divided into four provinces. The √ârainn continued to rule in Ulster and Munster, while the Lagin and their allies became the dominant force in Leinster and Connacht. Traditionally these four provinces met at the exact centre of the country, which was marked by the Hill of Uisneach (between Mullingar and Athlone in County Westmeath), a name which may mean \\"vertex\\" or \\"angular place\\". The district immediately surrounding this hill was originally called Medion \\"middle\\", and is the origin of the name of County Meath. Julius Caesar informs us that the druids of Gaul regularly assembled at a hallowed spot in the centre of Gaul to celebrate their rituals (De Bello Gallico 6.13). Irish tradition records that a similar assembly, the M√≥rd√°il Uisnig, periodically took place at the Hill of Uisneach on Beltane, the May-day festival. The Goidelic invasion The fourth and final Celtic invasion of Ireland was the Goidelic or Gaelic invasion. Unlike the previous invaders, the Goidels spoke a Q-Celtic language, which was the forerunner of Modern Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx. The P-Celtic dialects which were spoken in the country at the time of their arrival (and which they referred to as Iarnb√©lre, ‚Äúlanguage of the √ârainn‚Äù) eventually became extinct. The Goidels originated in Gallia Aquitania in southwestern Gaul. Around 100 BC two groups of these Celts emigrated to Ireland: The Connachta were named after Conn of the Hundred Battles, a mythical ancestor who was later euhemerized and given a place in Irish history. The Connachta were led by a man known to later history as T√∫athal Techtmar. They landed at the mouth of the Boyne and pushed inland to Tara, the seat of the local Ernean king, which they sacked. They soon carved out for themselves a new province between Ulster and Leinster, running from the mouth of the Liffey to the mouth of the Boyne and inland as far as the Shannon. In time, this fifth province came to be known as ‚ÄúMeath,‚Äù presumably for no other reason than that it contained the Hill of Uisneach. The other group were known as the E√≥ganachta. Their leader is known to history as Mogh (or Mug) Nuadat. The Eoganachta landed at a place called Inber Sc√©ne, usually identified with Kenmare River in the southwest of the country. Unlike the Connachta, they did not carve out a new province for themselves. Instead, they slowly but gradually rose in power, eventually becoming the dominant force in Munster. The names E√≥ganachta and Mug Nuadat, which were probably adopted after their arrival, suggest that initially there were friendly relations between them and the √ârainn, as both names are derived from the titles of Ernean deities. Early in their history, the Connachta subjugated the Laginian tribes of Leinster and reduced them to a state of vassalage. The Laginian leaders were allowed to retain possession of their territory, but a heavy tribute was imposed upon them. Known as the B√≥rama (or B√≥r√∫), it continued to be exacted at irregular intervals until the 8th century of the common era. According to one tradition, it was Tuathal Techtmar himself who first imposed this tribute on the Lagin. As their name suggests, the Connachta did not stop when they reached the Shannon. At an indeterminable point in history, some of them crossed the Shannon and conquered the western province, bestowing their name on it in the process. By the late 4th century of the common era Ireland was divided politically into five provinces or \\"overkingdoms\\": *Ulster was still dominated by Ernean tribes *Meath, or the Midland territory, included Tara and was ruled by Gaelic tribes *Leinster was held by Gaelicized tribes subject to Meath *Munster was ruled by Gaelic tribes *Connacht was ruled by Gaelic tribes References *O'Rahilly, T.

Symptoms Sandhoff disease symptoms are clinically indeterminable from Tay‚ÄìSachs disease. The classic infantile form of the disease has the most severe symptoms and is incredibly hard to diagnose at this early age. The first signs of symptoms begin before 6 months of age and the parents‚Äô notice when the child begins regressing in their development. If the children had the ability to sit up by themselves or crawl they will lose this ability. This is caused by a slow deterioration of the muscles in the child‚Äôs body from the buildup of GM2 gangliosides. Since the body is unable to create the enzymes it needs within the central nervous system, it is unable to attach to these gangliosides to break them apart and make them non-toxic. With this buildup there are several symptoms that begin to appear such as muscle/motor weakness, sharp reaction to loud noises, blindness, deafness, inability to react to stimulants, respiratory problems and infections, mental retardation, seizures, cherry red spots in the retina, enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), pneumonia, or bronchopneumonia. The other two forms of Sandhoff disease have similar symptoms but to a lesser extent. Adult and juvenile forms of Sandhoff disease are more rare than the infantile form. In these cases victims suffer cognitive impairment (retardation) and a loss of muscle coordination that impairs and eventually destroys their ability to walk; the characteristic red spots in the retina also develop. The adult form of the disease, however, is sometimes milder, and may only lead to muscle weakness that impairs walking or the ability to get out of bed. Causes Two parents carrying a mutated gene and passing it on to their offspring cause the disease. Even with both parents carrying the disease in their genome, there is only a 25% chance that they will have a child containing the genetic coding for the disease (see figure right). Each form of the disease is caused by the differences in the various mutations of the genome, in particular the codons on the 14 exons in the HEX B gene located within chromosome 5 (see figure bottom), leading to the differences in severities of the symptoms. The difference in the codons has the consequence of inhibiting two enzymes located in the lysosomes of the neurons of the central nervous system. Lysosomes contain various enzymes to break down byproducts and toxins to ensure they do not accumulate enough to interfere with the function of the central nervous system. Using restriction enzymes, it was discovered that a mutation on chromosome 5 particularly within the C1214T allele caused the adult onset form of Sandhoff Disease. For the patient showing symptoms of the infantile or juvenile form they have a mutation on exon I207V from their father, and a 16 base pair deletion from their mother which can be located on as many as five exons, exons 1‚Äì5. align=left = Mutations and polymorphism = Articles regarding Sandhoff disease frequencies among distinct groups of people contain discrepancies from one another. More than 25 mutations have been reported other than novel mutations. One article says that Sandhoff disease is found commonly in individuals with a non-Jewish descent. Others say that it is more commonly in: * the Creole population of northern Argentina * the indigenous M√©tis in Saskatchewan * Christian Maronite communities from Cyprus Discovery of several mutations in Ashkenazi Jews may reflect ascertainment bias rather than a high population frequency, because Ashkenazi Jews were the targeted population in a mass screening program for Tay-Sachs disease. Several rare SD mutations were discovered as researchers resolved cases of enzyme deficiency among suspected TSD carriers, but no cases of the disease itself have been reported. However, since it is an autosomal recessive disease, it is likely found in any ethnic group passing from generation to generation through carriers without being expressed in their offspring. Even though the family may not have a history of Sandhoff disease, it is possible for two individuals to have a child with the disease. Since Sandhoff disease was only discovered in 1968, there are years the disease has gone undetected because of misdiagnoses. Pathophysiology Biallelic pathogenic variants in the HEXB gene cause Sandhoff disease. The gene provides instructions for making a protein crucial to the enzymes beta-hexosaminidase A and beta-hexosaminidase B, which function in nerve cells to break down fatty substances, complex sugars, and molecules that are linked to sugars. In particular, beta- hexosaminidase A breaks down a fatty compound called GM2 ganglioside. Mutations in the HEXB gene disrupt the activity of these enzymes, preventing the breakdown of GM2 ganglioside and other molecules. As a result, progressive damage caused by the resulting buildup of GM2 ganglioside leads to the destruction of nerve cells, causing the signs and symptoms associated with Sandhoff disease. Diagnosis Sandhoff disease can be detected through the following procedures (before it is apparent through physical examination): a biopsy removing a sample of tissue from the liver, genetic testing, molecular analysis of cells and tissues (to determine the presence of a genetic metabolic disorder), enzyme assay, and occasionally a urinalysis to determine if the above-noted compounds are abnormally stored within the body. For a child to suffer from this disease, both parents must be carriers, and both must transmit the mutation to the child. Thus, even in the case where both parents have the mutation, there is only a 25 percent chance their child will inherit the condition. Frequently, parents are given the opportunity to have a DNA screening if they are at high risk, to determine their carrier status before they have children. However, it is also highly recommended to undergo testing even for those parents who do not have a family history of Sandhoff disease. Over 95% of the families that have children with Sandhoff disease had no known prior family history of the condition, as the mutation in the HEXB gene does not cause clinical symptoms when only one copy is present, and often passed undetected from one generation to the next Naturally, if an individual carries the mutation, he or she has a risk of transmitting it to the unborn child. Genetic counseling is recommended for those who have the mutation. It is possible for parents who are about to have a child or had a child with Sandhoff Disease can have a PGD or PEGD. PEGD is pre-embryonic genetic diagnosis for the parents that would not benefit from a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis because of their religion or negative attitude for the discarding of embryos. PEGD sequences the genome of the embryo to be produced by two parents if they were to conceive a child. If the family has a history of Sandhoff disease it is recommended they have their genome sequenced to ensure they are not carriers or to sequence the genome of their child. =Types= There are three types of Sandhoff disease: classic infantile, juvenile, and adult late onset. Each form is classified by the severity of the symptoms as well as the age at which the patient shows these symptoms. * Classic infantile form of the disease is classified by the development of symptoms anywhere from 2 months to 9 months of age. It is the most severe of all of the forms and will lead to death before the patient reaches the age of three. This is the most common and severe form of Sandhoff disease. Infants with this disorder typically appear normal until the age of 3 to 6 months, when development slows and muscles used for movement weaken. Affected infants lose motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling. As the disease progresses, infants develop seizures, vision and hearing loss, dementia, and paralysis. An eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination, is characteristic of this disorder. Some infants with Sandhoff disease may have enlarged organs (organomegaly) or bone abnormalities. Children with the severe form of this disorder usually live only into early childhood. * Juvenile form of the disease shows symptoms starting at age 3 ranging to age 10 and, although the child usually dies by the time they are 15, it is possible for them to live longer if they are under constant care. Symptoms include autism, ataxia, motor skills regression, spacticity, and learning disorders. * Adult onset form of the disease is classified by its occurrence in older individuals and has an effect on the motor function of these individuals. It is not yet known if Sandhoff disease will cause these individuals to have a decrease in their life span. Juvenile and adult onset forms of Sandhoff disease are very rare. Signs and symptoms can begin in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood and are usually milder than those seen with the infantile form of Sandhoff disease. As in the infantile form, mental abilities and coordination are affected. Characteristic features include muscle weakness, loss of muscle coordination (ataxia) and other problems with movement, speech problems, and mental illness. These signs and symptoms vary widely among people with late-onset forms of Sandhoff disease. Treatment Currently Sandhoff disease does not have any standard treatment and does not have a cure. However, a person suffering from the disease needs proper nutrition, hydration, and maintenance of clear airways. To reduce some symptoms that may occur with Sandhoff disease, the patient may take anticonvulsants to manage seizures or medications to treat respiratory infections, and consume a precise diet consisting of puree foods due to difficulties swallowing. Infants with the disease usually die by the age of 3 due to respiratory infections. The patient must be under constant surveillance because they can suffer from aspiration or lack the ability to change from the passageway to their lungs versus their stomach and their spit travels to the lungs causing bronchopneumonia. The patient also lacks the ability to cough and therefore must undergo a treatment to shake up their body to remove the mucus from the lining of their lungs. Medication is also given to patients to lessen their symptoms including seizures. Currently the government is testing several treatments including N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin in mice, as well as stem cell treatment in humans and other medical treatments recruiting test patients. A Sandhoff disease study showing proof of principle for gene therapy in a human model system using CRISPR and virus gene correction gives the chance for clinical trials to cure the disease. The ultra-rare occurrence is a main hurdle to overcome for clinical trials. History Sphingolipidoses Sandhoff disease is one of several forms of what was formerly known as amaurotic idiocy. This inherited disease is characterized by the accumulation of lipid-containing cells in the viscera and in the nervous system, mental retardation, and impaired vision or blindness. The chemical and enzymatic analysis of various patients with amaurotic idiocy by Konrad Sandhoff (1939- ), a German Biochemist, who led to the identification of several biochemically distinct diseases: The first biochemical description of GM1-gangliosidosis in 1963, Sandhoff disease in 1968, Tay-Sachs-Disease, the AB-variant of GM2-Gangliosidosis and the B1-variant of GM2-gangliosidosis. It came to the discovery of the molecular defect in Sandhoff disease, when Konrad Sandhoff studied the biochemistry of sphingolipids and gangliosides in the laboratory of Prof. Horst Jatzkewitz (1912‚Äì2002), a German Biochemist (Max- Planck- Institute for Psychiatry, Munich). In October 1966, he obtained deep-frozen autopsy material from an infantile case with amaurotic idiocy. The glycolipid analysis soon demonstrated differences from all the cases studied before. Besides the neuronal storage of GM2, the storage of GA2 was much more pronounced, and different from all cases of Tay-Sachs disease studied so far, globoside accumulated in the visceral organs and, most importantly, hexosaminidase activity was almost completely absent. The disease causing catabolic enzyme deficiency of hexosaminidases was demonstrated with four different substrates (p‚Äìnitrophenyl-Œ≤-D-N-acetylglucosaminide, p-nitrophenyl- Œ≤-D-N-acetylgalactosaminide, glycolipid [3H]GA2 and [3H]globoside) in four different organs and published in 1968.

Allies =Tracy family= * Dick Tracy - The titular hero of the strip. Born in 1909 (eight years after creator Chester Gould). In 1931, before even joining the Police, he had captured his first villain Pinkie the Stabber. While leading a posse against the Arsons and Cutie Diamond, Tracy is seen in a police uniform and not his regular plainclothes. He served as a lieutenant (senior grade) in US Navy Intelligence during World War II. * Tess Trueheart - The detective's love interest and later wife. When she was first introduced, she was kidnapped by Big Boy Caprice's men after they robbed and shot her father Emil Truehart. She served as a WAC in World War II, and later opened her own photography agency. She is the mother of Bonnie Braids Tracy, Joseph Flintheart Tracy, and adoptive mother of Junior Tracy. Temporarily divorced her husband in the 1990s, but later reconciled with him. * Junior Tracy - The adopted son of Dick Tracy. First appeared in a Steve the Tramp storyline. In 1937's The Blank storyline he is 10 years old. He was originally named John \\"Jackie\\" Steele, and his birth parents were wealthy prospector Hank Steele and his wife Mary Steele, both of whom appeared in the strip. Became a police forensic artist. * Moon Maid - The beautiful first wife of Junior Tracy. She was one of the moon people, an alien race with large eyes, giraffe-like antennae, and laser powers. First introduced to the strip in 1963, Moon Maid was the daughter of the supreme ruler of the moon, known as the Moon Governor. She had blonde hair and wore a black body stocking, thigh high boots, and white gloves. She fell in love with Junior and took him back to the moon in Diet Smith's space coupe, then returned to Earth to live her life with her husband. She often used her laser powers to help the police capture criminals. In 1965 she and Junior had a beautiful daughter named Honeymoon. In 1978, Moon Maid was accidentally killed by a car bomb intended for Dick Tracy. After his daughter's death, the Moon Governor broke off all relations with Earth. In 2011, Moon Maid's first name was revealed to be Mysta, shortly after, the new \\"Moon Maid\\" destroyed Mysta's gravestone. * Sparkle Plenty - Daughter of B.O. Plenty and Gravel Gertie. She married Vera Alldid, divorced, then married Junior Tracy. She and Junior have one daughter named Sparkle Plenty Jr. * Crystal Plenty - Cousin of Sparkle Plenty, a vegan who practices New Age spiritual arts. * Bonnie Braids (Sometimes spelled Bonny) - Daughter of Dick Tracy and Tess Trueheart. Born in the back of a squad car May 4, 1951. * Joseph Flintheart Tracy - The younger son of Dick Tracy and Tess Trueheart, named after Vitamin Flintheart for his bravery in saving both Tess and Joseph. * Honeymoon Tracy - Daughter of Moon Maid and Junior, born in outer space. When very young, she witnessed her mother's death from a car bomb meant for Dick Tracy. She was later adopted by Sparkle Plenty when she and Junior were married. Half-sister of Sparkle Plenty Jr. * Sparkle Plenty Jr. - Daughter of Junior Tracy and Sparkle Plenty, granddaughter of Dick Tracy and Tess Trueheart and B.O. Plenty and Gravel Gertie. Half sister of Honeymoon Tracy. * Gordon Tracy - Dick Tracy's brother. * Jean Tracy - Dick Tracy's sister. * Chester Tracy - Father of Dick, Jean, and Gordon Tracy. * Edna Tracy - Mother of Dick, Jean, and Gordon Tracy. * Ray Tracy - Brother of Chester Tracy, he is a minister and has performed all the Tracy family wedding ceremonies. =Professional comrades= * Chief Brandon - Chief of Police in the strip's first appearance on October 4, 1931. He joined the police in 1919 and later replaced Chief Norris who was elected Mayor. Brandon retired in 1949 in shame after the murderer of Brilliant Smith, an inventor who was under the department's protection slipped past Brandon's personal vetting. After retirement, he opened a hardware business named \\"Lawn Order\\" (a pun on \\"Law and Order\\"). Years later, Big Frost (who had tricked Brandon into getting access to Brilliant Smith in order to kill him) tried to kill Brandon. Brandon was wounded and Big Frost was killed. * Pat Patton - Former welder turned police officer who was Tracy's long-time sidekick and partner on the police force. Later appointed Brandon's successor as Chief of Police upon which Sam Catchem became Tracy's new partner. He served as comic relief due to his inexperience although that role eventually was reduced as his various adventures allowed him to grow into his profession. The introduction of B.O. Plenty/Gravel Gertie and Vitamin Flintheart would later supplant him for humor. However, with Patton's ascension to Police Chief, his character took on a much more serious tone with his previous role as Tracy's partner rarely mentioned again (although still slightly bumbling). Known for his \\"Irish temper\\". Shot by corrupt police officers Climer in 1982 and Lt. Teevo in 2007, but recovered both times. Recently reappointed as Chief after a successful treatment for cancer. * Sam Catchem (a pun on \\"catch (th)em\\") - Tracy's current partner since Pat Patton was appointed Chief. The 1990 film, Dick Tracy, featured both Pat Patton and Sam Catchem as Dick Tracy's partners. * Lizz Grove (n√©e Worthington) - Former nightclub photographer turned police officer with a particular talent for hand to hand combat. Briefly married to a newspaper reporter named Jimmy until Jimmy's death. Even more briefly married to Officer Groovy Grove (see below). The ceremony was conducted as Officer Grove was on his deathbed. He died shortly after he and Lizz were declared man and wife. Served as Chief of Police during Pat Patton's temporary retirement. Her sister was murdered by Joe Period in the 1950s. * Diet Smith - Industrialist who supplied advanced equipment for Tracy and the police department. Responsible for the creation of the Space Coupe, Two-way Wrist Radio, Two-way Wrist TV, Two-way Wrist Computer, and Two-way Wrist Genee. Originally suspected of murdering his partner in 1946 in his first appearance. Regularly seen drinking glasses of milk. * Brilliant - Son of Diet Smith, inventor of the Two-way Wrist Radio. His murder at the hands of mob leader Big Frost led to Chief Brandon's retirement and the promotion of Pat Patton to Chief. * George \\"Cal\\" Bullet Sr. - Highway Police Chief murdered by his own son Cal Bullet Jr. when he discovered his son's treasonous involvement with Pruneface. The accidental discovery of his body by Dick Tracy led to Pruneface's capture and the death of Cal Bullet Jr. at the hands of his own deadly poison gas. * J. Scotland Bumstead - British detective assigned to the European Secret Police. Brother of mob attorney Giorgio Spaldoni. * Frizzeltop - One-armed woman friend of Dick Tracy and Junior Tracy, named for the shock of frizzy hair on her head. {She was a US military nurse who lost her arm in a Japanese airplane attack on Bataan in 1941; she escaped capture after she was medically sent home to the United States}. After Pruneface's associate Clara is captured, Frizzeltop impersonates her to trick Cal Bullet Jr. into leading the law to Pruneface. Frizzeltop later married Dennis O'Copper. * Porfiry Ivanov - Russian detective who Dick Tracy has been obliged to work with from time to time. * Haku Kou - Native Hawaiian undercover cop in the Honolulu Police Department who worked with Tracy on the Willie the Fifth and Li'l Pineapple cases. * Dan Liu - Real-life Chinese-American Chief of the Honolulu PD at the time the Willie the Fifth and Li'l Pineapple cases were published, who made several prominent appearances in the strip, consulting with Tracy during those cases. * Lottie Latte - First appeared on April 8, 2006 as the criminal associate of Al Kinda in a plot to con the Plentys out of their lottery winnings. Lottie appeared to be either a male transvestite or a transgender person. After turning the tables on Al Kinda, it was revealed that Lottie is in fact the FBI's top undercover agent and \\"best marksperson in the department.\\" * Kitty - Comic relief pet cat addicted to cigar smoke. Belonged to Matty Square and Mr. Bribery. Member of the Police Department Zoo. * Li'l Dropout- A chimpanzee with a talent for painting. Member of the Police Department Zoo. * Mugg - A boxer dog who helped Dick Tracy bring down his own particular enemy Pearshape. Partial to riding on top of police cars. Member of the Police Department Zoo. * Captain Bowline - US Navy Intelligence and Tracy's superior. He appeared in the storylines for Flattop Jones and The Brow. * Lt. Marks - US Navy Intelligence plainclothes officer who assisted Tracy during The Brow case. * Nolan - Police clerk who helped Tracy trace ownership of Arthur \\"Nip\\" Dolton's wrecked car. * Constable John Doe aka John Law(?)- Officer who foolishly tried to follow alone killer Cutie Diamond to his Mountain Hideaway and was killed by Diamond in valley below hideout in 1930.

When the real killer was exposed, Grove was released and later joined the police force in 1970, becoming a uniformed beat patrolman and the fianc√© of Lizz. He was also the father of blind Tinky from his brief first marriage. In 1984 he was fatally wounded in the line of duty. Grove married Lizz while on his deathbed, so that she would receive the \\"widow's benefits\\" traditionally paid to the spouse of a police officer killed while on duty. * Patrolman Jenson - Unseen patrol officer who found block message left by The Blank in a dime store. * Patrolman Milligan - Stock character Irish uniformed beat patrolman who figured in many of the earliest stories (and died on several occasions).

Based on the Pawnee Chief Yellow Horse. A stereotype who can barely speak English. (Similar stereotypes appeared in the strip during the 1940s, such as the African-American doormen in the Mary-X storyline, the railroad porters in the 88 Keyes storyline and \\"Jade\\", the cowardly Jewish-American salesman.) * Special Agent Jim Trailer - FBI agent who helped Tracy in the Famon Brothers case and the Black Pearl episode. Also appears years later in further episodes, assigned to work with Tracy on the kidnapping of Diet Smith, and in other cases like Dr. Kryos Freezdrei and the return of Pruneface * Special Agent Fritz Ann Dietrich - The FBI agent who has been seen the most often in the 2010s. * Ms. Steffihawk - Receptionist at police headquarters. * Town Marshal Wilke Wilkinson - Marshall of Layon Junction.

As the History is unknown it probably started out as a frontier Settlement with the Chief law officer bring a Sheriff of the County; later when the community grew law enforcement became the responsibility of an elected Constable or Town Marshal. As a large metropolitan City the Police Force is Administrated by a Chief of Police divided into a Uniform Beat Patrolmen Division (Adam-12) and a Plainclothes/Detective Squad (Dragnet). The Detective Division is divided by Specialty-such as Robbery Detail; Homicide Squad; Stolen Art Detail; Missing Persons Bureau; Organized Crime Task Force. There would also be a Crime Lab. A related Jurisdicton is the City Medical Department Forensic Coroner (Quincy M.E.; C.S.I).

Teevo- Commications specialist-who had ties to the \\"Apparatus\\"; tried to kill Pat Patton but killed by a man eating plant trying to escape arrest. *Inspector Price- member of Organized Crime Unit-also had ties to the \\"Apparatus\\"; was given Immunity from Prosceution in return for testimony against Organized Crime Bosses =Personal acquaintances= * Bob Oscar \\"B.O.\\" Plenty - In his first appearance in 1945 he was a bachelor farmer living in a mess of a house, wearing torn clothes bought \\"on account\\", who hadn't left his farm for fifty years. \\"B.O.\\" constantly chews tobacco and is noted for having a rather \\"musky\\" scent that follows him around. He is a former criminal and later personal friend of the Tracys. After Shaky's body was discovered by his stepdaughter Breathless Mahoney, Breathless stole his estate money from her mother and met B.O. on the run. Plenty and Breathless eluded Tracy. Eventually, Plenty forced her to lead him to the bank where the money was hidden in a safety deposit box where he then nearly strangled and robbed her in the viewing room. After escaping with the money, he attempted to enjoy his wealth, which unfortunately drew the attention of the widow of B.B. Eyes and the sadistic gangster, Itchy, who robbed and attempted to murder him by tying him to a board and casting him into the city sewer system to drown. However, Plenty managed to safely exit the system and entered open sea where he was rescued by a tramp steamer headed for China. After returning to the city, he met Gravel Gertie and finally got his criminal charges resolved. Unable to pronounce Tracy's name correctly (usually calling him Macy or some variant thereof). He and Gertie are the parents of Sparkle Plenty, who married to Junior Tracy. In an Archie's TV Funnies episode, he appeared as a captive of \\"Pear Shape\\" Tone who tried to capture Dick Tracy. * Gravel Gertie - Former criminal and now wife of B.O. Plenty. Introduced in The Brow storyline in 1944. She was a widow for thirty years after her first husband sold her farm rights to turn the farm into a gravel pit and then died when his car backed into his own gravel pit in 1914. Tried to hide the Brow from the police after she found him in a wrecked car and was arrested when her hair from her clothes brush matched gray hair found near a burning car. In a comic relief moment, the Brow fled in terror when he caught his first glimpse of his guardian angel. In his struggle to escape an old-fashioned lamp was knocked over burning her shack and her long hair. Later married B.O. Plenty and gave birth to Sparkle Plenty. In a later storyline, it was established that Gertie had spent part of her childhood in an orphanage; while she was there, criminals shaved her head and tattooed onto her bald pate a treasure map showing the location of their buried loot, then allowed her hair to regrow to conceal the map which was belatedly rediscovered well into Gertie's adulthood. Dick Tracy was a popular strip for the railroad workers, and Gravel Gertie is the affectionate nickname of a part of the Clifton Forge line of the C & O Railroad. It stretches from Hinton, West Virginia to Clifton Forge, Virginia and delivered limestone gravel quarried from Fort Spring to the iron furnaces of Virginia as a fluxing agent. * Vera Alldid - First husband of Sparkle Plenty, unilaterally divorced her. Cartoonist of \\"The Invisible Tribe\\", a strip revolving around a Native American tribe who speak but are never seen. Once a millionaire cartoonist, he was forced to work by Abner Kadaver into drawing horror comics for a living. He later created another popular comic strip that parodied Dick Tracy. * Emil Trueheart - Father of Tess Trueheart. His murder by Big Boy's gangster \\"Crutch\\" would lead to Dick Tracy's vow to fight crime. * Kiss Andtel (1947) - A blonde singer engaged to Mumbles until she found out he was a thief. In revenge, Mumbles stole her car which resulted in the death of a highway patrolman. Later she was forced to sing with his old group after he threatened to blind her. At sea in a cabin cruiser Mumbles tied her up and set up a bomb - which Dick Tracy threw overboard at the last minute. She later becomes a singing star. Mother of Kisme Quick (1994) by Mumbles. * Mrs. Trueheart - Mother of Tess Trueheart. Present when her husband was murdered. Although wounded by Pruneface, her photograph of the villain helped lead to his downfall. She also made cameo appearances in the Flattop Jones and The Brow storylines. * Vitamin Flintheart - Former motion picture thespian who in his heyday made over $500.00 a week, now just a hypochondriac ham actor who, when he is not quoting William Shakespeare, has to take vitamin pills (which he cons Patrolman Murphy and Flattop to get for him) and Bismuth subgallate. Husband of Snowflake Falls, he first appeared in the Flattop Jones storyline at the age of 50 years. Also appeared in the storylines of The Brow and Shaky. His medicine bottle led to Flattop's doom while his fur coat brought about Shaky's demise. Was unwitting accomplice to Flattop's brother, Blowtop Jones. Both Vitamin and Snowflake made cameo appearances in the Dr. Kryos Freezdrei and Pruneface storylines. It has been established that one of Vitamin's film appearances was in The Bowery Boys Meet the Bard, presumably as the Bard. * Kandikane Lane - Documentary filmmaker, and since Nov. 2014 she and Vitamin Flintheart have been sweethearts. Her distinctive feature is alternate white and red stripes on her bangs, and her penchant for sucking on candy canes. In one strip she spoke on the telephone with her sister Margot about their sister, Lois, who had a thing for men who wore capes (presumably Superman). * Loma (1941) - Secretary/circus trapeze artist who saved Dick Tracy's life after Littleface Finny's henchman untied the window washer's platform Tracy was using to spy on Little Face. Later kidnapped by Little Face, she was knocked unconscious in a car accident after Little Face killed the driver of the hijacked car and subsequently found by Tracy. * Don Quick Oatie (Pun on Don Quixote) - Crazy senior citizen who dressed in medieval armour. Saved Tracy and Liz from the killer Oily when Oatie accidentally short circuited a fuse box in a garage causing snow to melt leading the roof to collapse, knocking Boily into a vat of boiling oil. Later Oatie attacked a \\"dragon\\" (electric windmill) in which Oily and Slick had taken refuge, causing Oily and Slick to fall to their deaths in an electric power plant. Oatie survived but was returned to the Leafy Acres Mental Asylum. * Hank Steele - Blind silver miner and biological father of Junior Tracy. Murdered by Stooge Viller while trying to protect his son. * Mary Steele - Mother of Junior Tracy.

While her overall dimensions remained the same over her career, the addition of new equipment raised her displacement to 1,025 tons by the end of her Coast Guard service. She was designed to perform light ice-breaking. Her hull was reinforced with an \\"ice belt\\" of thicker steel around her waterline to protect it from punctures. Similarly, her bow was reinforced and shaped to ride over ice in order to crush it with the weight of the ship. Acacia had a single 5-blade propeller in diameter. It was driven by a diesel-electric propulsion system. Two Cooper-Bessemer GND-8 4-cycle 8-cylinder Diesel engines produced 600 horsepower each. They provided power to two Westinghouse generators. The electricity from the generators ran an electric motor which turned the propeller. She had a single cargo boom which had the ability to lift 20 tons onto her buoy deck. The ship's fuel tanks had a capacity of approximately . Acacia's unrefueled range was at 13 knots, at 12 knots, and at 8.3 knots. Her potable water tanks had a capacity of . Considering dry storage capacity and other factors, her at-sea endurance was 21 days. Her wartime complement was 6 officers and 74 enlisted men. By 1964 this was reduced to 5 officers, 2 warrant officers, and 42 enlisted personnel. Acacia was initially armed with a 3\\"/50 caliber gun mounted behind the pilot house. She also had two 20mm guns, one mounted on top of the wheelhouse and one on the aft deck. She carried these weapons in the Great Lakes under a wartime agreement with the Government of Canada. The Rush-Bagot Treaty had largely demilitarized the lakes, but the United States and Canada agreed to suspend some of its provisions during World War II. After the war ended, the treaty came back into full effect and all of Acacia's on-deck armament was removed, leaving only small arms for law enforcement actions. In 2006 Acacia and the other 10 Coast Guard cutters in the Great Lakes were armed with M 240B machine guns. This action was taken due to greater concerns regarding smuggling and terrorists entering the United States by boat. It was preceded by consultation with the Government of Canada under the terms of the Rush-Bagot Treaty. At the time of construction, Acacia was designated WAGL, an auxiliary vessel, lighthouse tender. The designation was system was changed in 1965, and she was redsignated WLB, an oceangoing buoy tender. The ship's original name was Thistle, but when it was learned that the US Army was operating USAHS Thistle the Coast Guard changed it to Acacia. She was named after the United States Lighthouse Service tender Acacia, the only tender sunk during World War II.  Operating history  Acacia's first home port was Detroit, Michigan. Her primary mission was maintaining aids to navigation. Much of her activity was driven by the annual advance and retreat of heavy winter ice on the Great Lakes. Buoys were brought to port in the fall to prevent them from being damaged, sunk, or set adrift by ice. Acacia was reported to have picked up about 150 buoys from the Detroit River and nearby waters in ten days in December 1948. Buoys were cleaned, repaired, and repainted over the winter and redeployed by the ship in the spring. Her second mission was icebreaking, a service she performed throughout her career. One aspect of her icebreaking work was to free ships that became trapped in the ice. In January 1945, for example, the freighter James Watt with a cargo of coal for the Ford River Rogue factory became ice-bound in Lake Erie. She struggled to free herself for two days without success. Acacia freed her within a half-hour of her arrival. In a similar case, she freed two tankers and a collier from Lake Erie ice in December 1951. A second icebreaking role was to escort ships through the ice, breaking a channel for the ship following her. This service was not without risk. On April 1, 1954 Acacia was leading the tanker L. S. Westcoat through the ice when she was rammed in the stern by her charge. The hulls of both vessels were damaged. A third icebreaking activity was to clear shipping lanes for future ship traffic. Acacia cleared ice in Lake Erie, the Straits of Mackinac, Lake St. Claire, and the Saint Claire River. Acacia also participated in numerous search and rescue missions. In October of 1951, the freighter George F. Rand collided with another ship in the Saint Claire River. Her hull was breached and she began to flood. Acacia was dispatched to provide assistance which included emergency pumps to control the flooding. On June 1, 1956 Acacia towed the disabled freighter George Hindman from the Saint Claire River where she was blocking ship traffic. The freighter Daniel J. Morrell broke up and sank in a storm on Lake Huron in November 1964. Acacia was dispatched to search for the crew and recovered the bodies of eight. A happier outcome was obtained after two freighters collided at the mouth of the Saint Claire River during the night of August 26, 1971. Acacia was able to rescue 16 people from Trans Michigan. In the summer of 1958 Acacia's home port was changed to Port Huron, Michigan, where a new berth was built for her. The city spent $10,667 on the dock.. The change in home port did not fundamentally change the ship's mission. She was responsible for 145 aids to navigation in the Port Huron area. She continued to break ice in the Saint Claire River, and during several winters participated in \\"Operation Coal Shovel\\" to break ice between Toledo, Ohio and Detroit for the coal ships supplying power plants and industries in Detroit. In May 1975 Acacia sailed from Port Huron to the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland for major renovations. The majority of Acacia's crew transferred to the freshly renovated USCGC Bramble and sailed their new ship back to Port Huron. Acacia's main electrical motor was renovated, and new electrical switchboards and wiring were installed. Her main engines were overhauled. Crew spaces were modernized and enlarged by reducing the size of the forward hold. Water pipes were replaced and a new sewage system was installed. A bow thruster was added to improve the ship's maneuverability. The electric drive that ran the cargo boom was replaced with a hydraulic system. Over $9 million was appropriated for this renovation.USCGC Acacia in Charlevoix in 2001 After her refit, Acacia was assigned to Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, where she replaced USCGC Mesquite, which was beginning her own renovation. Mesquite's crew was assigned to Acacia. Upon leaving the Coast Guard Yard, Acacia sailed to the Caribbean for training exercises. She arrived at her new homeport in September 1976. Her time at Sturgeon Bay was similar to her earlier service in Lakes Huron and Erie. Heavy seasonal ice drove much of her work on the buoy system and icebreaking was a frequent responsibility. In the spring of 1979 Acacia was transferred to Grand Haven, Michigan. She was replaced in Sturgeon Bay by the newly launched USCGC Mobile Bay. Though moved across Lake Michigan, Acacia remained responsible for maintaining the same fleet of 220 buoys from Calumet Harbor to Little Bay De Noc. The smaller Mobile Bay did not have a crane capable of the work. She did get at least one new job while based at Grand Haven. In 1984, in cooperation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hatcheries and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Acacia released 400,000 lake trout fingerlings on offshore reefs in Lake Michigan. It was hoped that fish released in the middle of the lake would have a higher survival rate than those released along the shore. For four months during the winter of 19871988 Acacia was temporarily assigned to patrol Caribbean waters. During one of her patrols she intercepted 88 Haitians on a 45-foot (14 meter) wooden boat attempting to reach Florida. These refugees were repatriated to Haiti. She also assisted in the arrest of two Cuban drug smugglers. She arrived back in Grand Haven in April 1988, in time to replace buoys after the spring ice break-up. In December 1989, Acacia responded to the grounding of USCGC Mesquite off of the Keweenaw Peninsula in Lake Superior. Acacia was able to assist in stabilizing the wreck and containing the diesel oil spill. She was awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation for her work, but winter storms destroyed the abandoned Mesquite. The Coast Guard reassigned Acacia to Charlevoix, Michigan to replace Mesquite. There was no replacement cutter assigned to Grand Haven, reducing the number of buoy tenders in the Great Lakes from five to four. The Coast Guard justified the move based on cost savings, but others attributed it to the influence of U.S. Representative Bob Davis, who represented Charlevoix in Congress. He was vice- chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee at the time. The move left ill-feeling towards the Coast Guard in Grand Haven. Acacia arrived at her new homeport on June 15, 1990. After rioting broke out in Cuba in August 1994, Fidel Castro announced that anyone who wanted to leave the country could. Thousands did so, creating a crisis of unsafe small boats and rafts intent on reaching the United States. On August 26, 1994 Acacia was ordered to the Caribbean to respond. By the time she reached the area, Operation Uphold Democracy, the United States intervention to restore Jean- Bertrand Aristide to the presidency of Haiti, was underway. Acacia was retasked to survey and buoy the major ports that were used to support the operation including Port-au-Prince, Cap-Hatien, and Miragoane. The ship earned the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for her work in Haiti. She returned to Charlevoix on November 17, 1994. Acacia was decommissioned on June 7, 2006 after 62 years of service. She was the last of the 180-foot buoy tenders to be retired.  Museum  Immediately after decommissioning, Acacia was donated to the State of Illinois for the benefit of the American Academy of Industry. This nonprofit group planned to turn her into a maritime museum in Chicago. The vessel, which was delivered in full working order with only her machine guns removed, was temporarily moored at Burns Harbor in Indiana. The plan for a Chicago-based museum was never executed because suitable moorage could not be found. Through the efforts of a common board member, the ship was transferred from the American Academy of Industry to The Society for the Preservation of the S.S. City of Milwaukee. On October 16 2009, Acacia steamed under her own power to Manistee, Michigan, where she became part of the SS City of Milwaukee National Historic Landmark museum.SS City of Milwaukee and USCGC Acacia museum website The ship was dedicated in her new museum role on August 13, 2011.

Tansey (2014) Typhus and tyranny, Nature 511(7509), 291. and in the 1930s developed the concepts of the \\"Denkstil\\" (\\"thought style\\") and the \\"Denkkollektiv\\" (\\"thought collective\\"). The concept of the \\"thought collective\\" defined by him is important in the philosophy of science and in logology (the \\"science of science\\"), helping to explain how scientific ideas change over time, much as in Thomas Kuhn's later notion of the \\"paradigm shift\\" and in Michel Foucault's concept of the \\"episteme\\".  Life  Fleck was born in Lemberg (Lw√≥w in Polish; Lvov in Russian; now L'viv, Ukraine) and grew up in the cultural autonomy of the Austrian province of Galicia. He graduated from a Polish lyceum (secondary school) in 1914 and enrolled at Lw√≥w's Jan Kazimierz University, where he received his medical degree. In 1920 he became an assistant to the famous typhus specialist Rudolf Weigl at Jan Kazimierz University. From 1923 to 1935 Fleck worked in the department of internal medicine at Lw√≥w General Hospital, then became director of the bacteriological laboratory at the local social security authority. From 1935 he worked at the private bacteriological laboratory which he had earlier founded. With Nazi Germany's occupation of L'viv, Fleck was deported with his wife, Ernestina Waldmann, and son Ryszard to the city's Jewish ghetto. He continued his research in the hospital and developed a new procedure in which he procured a vaccine from the urine of typhus patients. Fleck's work was known to the German occupiers and his family were arrested in December 1942 and deported to the Laokoon pharmaceutical factory to produce a typhus serum. He and his family were arrested again and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp on February 7, 1943. His task was to diagnose syphilis, typhus and other illnesses using serological tests. From December 1943 until the liberation of Poland on April 11, 1945 Fleck was detained in Buchenwald concentration camp; there, he worked with Marian Ciepielowski to produce a working typhus vaccine for camp inmates, while producing a fake vaccine for the SS. Between 1945 and 1952, he served as the head of the Institute of Microbiology of the School of Medicine of Maria Sklodowska-Curie University of Lublin. In 1952, he moved to Warsaw to become the Director of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Mother and Child State Institute. In 1954 he was elected a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Fleck's research during these years focused on the question of the behavior of leucocytes in infectious and stress situations. Between 1946 and 1957 he published 87 medical and scientific articles in Polish, French, English and Swiss journals. In 1951 Fleck was awarded the National Prize for Scientific Achievements and in 1955 the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. In 1956, after a heart attack and the discovery that he was suffering from lymphosarcoma, Fleck emigrated to Israel where a position was created for him at the Israel Institute for Biological Research. He died in 1961 at the age of 64 of a second heart attack. The Ludwik Fleck Prize is awarded annually for the best book in the area of science and technology studies. It was created by the 4S Council (Society for the Social Studies of Science) in 1992.  Thought collective  Fleck wrote that the development of truth in scientific research was an unattainable ideal as different researchers were locked into thought collectives (or thought-styles). This means \\"that a pure and direct observation cannot exist: in the act of perceiving objects the observer, i.e. the epistemological subject, is always influenced by the epoch and the environment to which he belongs, that is by what Fleck calls the thought style.\\" A \\"truth\\" was a relative value, expressed in the language or symbolism of the thought collective in which it belonged, and subject to the social and temporal structure of this collective. To state therefore that a specific truth is true or false is impossible. It is true in its own collective, but incomprehensible or unverifiable in most others. He felt that the development of scientific insights was not unidirectional and does not consist of just accumulating new pieces of information, but also in overthrowing the old ones. This overthrowing of old insights is difficult because a collective attains over time a specific way of investigating, bringing with it a blindness to alternative ways of observing and conceptualization. Change was especially possible when members of two thought collectives met and cooperated in observing, formulating hypothesis and ideas. He strongly advocated comparative epistemology. This approach anticipated later developments in social constructionism, and especially the development of critical science and technology studies.

It is based on the book by Chrystine Brouillet. Plot Louise works as a waitress in a Chinese restaurant in the Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce neighbourhood of Montreal where she lives. She has become obsessed with the story of a recent spate of serial murders committed in the area, and scours newspapers for stories about each victim. The latest victim is a co-worker who last spoke of a blond, muscular man she met at the bar, and with whom she had a drink after she got off work at midnight. Louise's wheelchair-bound neighbour, Spencer, shares her interest to a point but values his privacy and solitude. When Victor, an awkward and talkative elementary school teacher, moves in to their apartment complex, he ingratiates himself into their lives and attempts to strike up a friendship, which they reluctantly accept. Louise, who prefers the company of her cats to humans, warms to Victor when he reveals that he is also a cat owner. When their abusive Francophone neighbour Val√©rie poisons Louise's cats, Louise spends more time at Victor's apartment, though she requests alone time with his cat. Victor, who has developed a crush on Louise, invents an imaginary love life with her and tells his friends that they have become engaged, though Louise denies any romantic feelings for Victor when Spencer probes her. When Spencer dispassionately reveals to Victor that he was paralyzed in a car accident that killed his wife, Spencer rejects Victor's sympathy and later reacts angrily when Victor installs a wheelchair-accessible ramp in the building. During the cover of night, Spencer sneaks out his window and climbs the fire escape, secretly enjoying the city's nightlife. During one of his secretive outings, one of Victor's friends spots him, though Victor dismisses the possibility that it could be Spencer. Louise uses sensationalist media reports to plan the murder of Val√©rie. After seducing Victor, she collects his sperm and uses it to give the impression that Val√©rie has been raped. On the way back to her apartment, holding evidence of her guilt, she runs into Spencer, who has gone out for a nighttime jog; caught in compromising positions, the two awkwardly acknowledge each other without asking any questions. Curious about the noise, Victor looks out his window and sees Spencer, whom he begins to suspect is the serial killer. Following a dinner party, where the three cautiously probe each other for information, Spencer outright suggests that Louise and he frame Victor for the deaths. At the same time, Victor proposes that Louise and he set a trap for Spencer. Louise agrees to both plans. As Spencer breaks into Victor's apartment, the police rush to his help, and Spencer flees to the fire escape toward Louise's apartment. Worried for her safety, Victor confronts Spencer, and Spencer falls to his death; Louise disinterestedly ignores the conflict as she feeds Victor's cat, whom she has adopted.

Carnitine, a natural substance acquired mostly through the diet, is used by cells to process fats and produce energy. People with this disorder have a faulty enzyme, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, that prevents these long-chain fatty acids from being transported into the mitochondria to be broken down. Symptoms and signs Signs and symptoms of this disorder include low levels of ketones (hypoketosis) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Together these signs are called hypoketotic hypoglycemia. People with this disorder typically also have an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), muscle weakness, and elevated levels of carnitine in the blood. Genetics Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Mutations in the CPT1A gene cause carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency by producing a defective version of an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. Without this enzyme, long-chain fatty acids from food and fats stored in the body cannot be transported into mitochondria to be broken down and processed. As a result, excessive levels of long-chain fatty acids may more rapidly build up in tissues, damaging the liver, heart and/or brain. This condition has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene must be inherited from both parents. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder. The prevalence of mutations associated with this condition reach 68% to 81% in certain arctic coastal populations, suggesting that the condition had some adaptive value in those habitats at some time. Fewer than 50 people have been identified with this condition. Diagnosis Genetic testing is necessary for diagnosis. =Differential diagnosis= This condition is sometimes mistaken for fatty acid and ketogenesis disorders such as Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD), other long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders such as Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency (CPT-II) and Reye syndrome. Treatment Treatment for this condition is supportive. There is no cure. Affected people should eat a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet and avoid fasting.

In 2008 he achieved the HM magazine's Readers Award for \\"favorite drummer\\", along with his bandmate Timothy McTague who received \\"favorite guitarist\\" of 2008. He was one of the preaching pastors at unveiledchurch.com based in the Tampa Bay area of Florida. Aaron and his former wife ran a clothing label, Pig Cloth. Gillespie left Underoath after a European tour in 2010 but later rejoined the band. Gillespie produced and performed on Collington's \\"We Swim in Seas that Never Rest\\" at his former Salt Lake City recording studio. The album was engineered, mixed and featured additional performances from singer and songwriter Andrew Goldring and was debuted by Relevant Magazine on their series, The Drop. Gillespie did guest vocals on the song \\"All About Us\\" by indie pop band He Is We, which was released on the album \\"My Forever\\" on November 23, 2010. Gillespie has discussed his issues with hypochondria and anxiety, stating that they played into his departure from Underoath.  Musical career  = Underoath = Gillespie performing as a part of Underoath during their 2007 winter tour Gillespie had performed on every Underoath release before √ò (Disambiguation) and first began to add clean vocals on Underoath's third album The Changing of Times, which shifted Underoath's original extreme metal music style into a more straightforward metalcore sound and was released in 2002. After lead vocalist Dallas Taylor parted with the band, Spencer Chamberlain joined and the band began to change its style of music even more. Most of the lyrics on the album They're Only Chasing Safety are written by Gillespie and are about him ending a four-year relationship. He stated to Alternative Press \\"I think I would've died if we didn't write those songs. I thought I had ruined someone's life. It's hard to explain, but you can't just pretend that things are great and go on and get married\\". The follow-up to They're Only Chasing Safety, Define the Great Line was released on June 20, 2006, it debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 selling over 98,000 copies in its first week, the record was certified Gold by the RIAA on November 11, 2006, representing 500,000 shipped units of the album. On April 5, 2010, Underoath announced that the band and Gillespie had agreed to mutually part ways pending the end of their European tour. On the same day, Gillespie posted a message on his personal blog. On August 17, 2015, in an interview article for Alternative Press, Chamberlain and Gillespie confirmed that the band was reuniting. = The Almost = Gillespie performing with the Almost in Sydney's \\"Big Exo Day\\" 2011 Gillespie performed lead vocals for the alternative rock band the Almost. The band's debut album Southern Weather was released on April 3, 2007, along with their first single, \\"Say This Sooner\\". The single reached a peak of No. 7 on the Billboard's US Modern Rock Charts. Gillespie recorded every instrument on the Southern Weather album except for bass on a couple of tracks, with which Kenny Vasoli from The Starting Line helped. On November 24, 2008, the Almost released an EP, No Gift to Bring. On October 6, 2009 they released another EP, Monster EP. On November 3, 2009 they released their second album, Monster Monster, in which the rest of the bandmates were more incorporated in the writing and recording processes. On June 11, 2013 the band released their third full-length album, Fear Inside Our Bones. In an interview released on February 8, 2015, on Emery's BadChristian podcast, Gillespie stated that he had placed lower priority on the band, citing his \\"busy schedule\\" (as Paramore's touring drummer, a solo artist and producer) and the \\"busy schedules\\" of the other band members. On September 24, 2019 they announced a fourth full-length album, Fear Caller, to be released on October 18, 2019, then released, \\"Chokehold\\", with an accompanying music video as part of the announcement. = Solo work = Shortly after leaving Underoath, Gillespie announced that he was working on a worship-based solo project. He went to The Compound recording studio in Seattle on June 28, 2010, to record the album that would eventually be released in March 2011. On his Twitter account on July 24, he posted \\"Finished my record. So great to be a part of it. Goodnight.\\" Gillespie's solo album Anthem Song was released on March 8, 2011. It debuted at number 90 on the Billboard 200. \\"Anthem Song\\" was Gillespie's revisit to his musical beginning, which began in worship. In an interview with CBN.com, Gillespie recounted the experience and how a trip to Africa helped shape Anthem Song. He stated \\"I saw people worshiping God because He exists, because that's what we were created to do. I believe everybody worships something, whether it be your job or your family or a relationship or whatever. We were all made to worship just one, and that's Jesus. And it really, really messed me up, seeing these African people who have nothing worshiping God, just because He exists. It gave me the fuel to go and do this record and also convicted me to leave Underoath and to pursue this ministry area in my life.\\" On February 3, 2015, he released his second worship album, Grace Through the Wandering. The record was made on the road while touring with Paramore and was produced by Paramore's touring key player, John. In 2016 Gillespie released the self-produced Out of the Badlands. Gillespie and his studio partner, Andrew Goldring, made the record at Gillespie's Salt Lake City studio, Soundcave. Goldring engineered, mixed and performed on the record. The album is a departure from his former worship record and instead focuses on his personal grieving and honesty. = Paramore = On August 26, 2013, Gillespie was officially announced as the new touring drummer for Paramore, after their previous touring drummer, Miles McPherson, suffered from an injury. He was to remain only for their duration of The Self- Titled Tour's European dates, but later remained for the duration of their North American fall tour of that year, as well as the Australian and New Zealand legs of the tour. Gillespie has stayed in the Paramore touring line-up for the next few years, playing drums on the Monumentour (Paramore's co- headlining tour with the band Fall Out Boy in 2014) and the Writing the Future Tour (in 2015), along with two of the band's \\"Parahoy!\\" Cruises - the first one (in March 2014) and the second one (in March 2016). However, in February 2016, Gillespie clarified that his role in Paramore doesn't extend beyond live performances and that he isn't involved in the songwriting/recording process with the band. With the reinstatement of Paramore's original drummer and with the reunion of Underoath, Gillespie is now back with Underoath full-time.  Producer  Aaron Gillespie operated as a producer out of Soundcave Studios from 2015-2017. Alongside of singer-songwriter, producer and engineer Andrew Goldring, Gillespie and Goldring worked on productions, most notably, Aaron Gillespie's solo record, \\"Out of the Badlands\\". Goldring also engineered, mixed and performed various instruments on the record. Other examples of Gillespie's producer credits include Collington's, We Swim in Seas that Never Rest. Gillespie produced the record, played drums and did other various session work with Goldring and Collington. The album was debuted by Relevant Magazine on their series \\"The Drop\\". Gillespie and Collington crossed paths when Collington was opening for Aaron Gillespie in Boston, Massachusetts. Taking a liking to Collington's music, Gillespie invited Collington to Salt Lake City to create a record. Collington originally laughed at the offer thinking it was a joke.  FM419  Gillespie worked and toured with the Billy Graham Association's FM419; an event that helps train students to share their faith. The event is a prelude to a much larger event, held a few months later where students can practice what they learned by leading others to Christ. Gillespie performed each day at the beginning and end of the conference.  Emergency surgery  While on tour with Underoath in 2007 in Las Vegas, Nevada, Gillespie underwent emergency surgery due to an infected thumb. Instead of canceling shows, Underoath recruited Kenny Bozich, former drummer of the Almost, to fill in on drums. Spencer Chamberlain and Timothy McTague shared duties in singing his vocal parts.

The tibial nerve passes through the popliteal fossa to pass below the arch of soleus. Structure =Popliteal fossa= Tibia nerve is the larger terminal branch of the sciatic nerve with root values of L4, L5, S1, S2, and S3. It lies superficial (or posterior) to the popliteal vessels, extending from the superior angle to the inferior angle of the popliteal fossa, crossing the popliteal vessels from lateral to medial side. It gives off branches as shown below: * Muscular branches - Muscular branches arises from the distal part of the popliteal fossa. It supplies the medial and lateral heads of gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris and popliteus muscles. Nerve to popliteus crosses the popliteus muscle, runs downwards and laterally, winds around the lower border of the popliteus to supply the deep (or anterior) surface of the popliteus. This nerve also supplies the tibialis posterior muscle, superior tibiofibular joint, tibia bone, interosseous membrane of leg, and the inferior tibiofibular joint. * Cutaneous branches - Tibial nerve also gives off a cutaneous nerve called the medial sural nerve from the middle of the popliteal fossa and exits at the inferior angle. It supplies the skin of the lower half of the back of the leg and lateral border of the foot until the tip of the little toe. * Articular branches - There are three articular branches arises from the upper part of the fossa: superior medial genicular nerve (located on the surface of medial condyle of femur, middle genicular nerve (pierces the posterior capsule of the knee joint to supply the structures located in the intercondylar notch of the femur, and inferior genicular nerve (runs along the upper border of the popliteus to reach the medial condyle of tibia). =Back of the leg= At the inferior angle of the popliteal fossa, tibial nerve passes deep to the tendinous arch of soleus to enter the back of the leg. In the leg, it runs downwards and medially to reach the posteromedial side of the ankle, midway between the medial malleolus and medial tubercle of the calcaneum. It terminates deep to the flexor retinaculum at the origin of the abductor hallucis by dividing into medial and lateral plantar nerves to supply the foot. The tibial nerve gives off several branches to supply the back of the leg: * Muscular branches - Supplies tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, and deep part of soleus. * Cutaneus branches - The medial calcaneal nerve pierces the flexor retinaculum to supply the skin of the back and lower surface of the heel. * Articular branches - Supplies the ankle joint =Foot= In the foot, the nerve terminates by dividing into medial and lateral plantar branches. * Medial plantar nerve - It is the larger terminal branch of the tibial nerve. It passes between the abductor hallucis and flexor digitorum brevis to divide further into branches. Its distribution resembles to that of the distribution of median nerve in the hand. Its muscular branches supply the abductor hallucis, the flexor digitorum brevis, the flexor hallucis brevis and the first lumbrical. Cutaneous distribution of the medial plantar nerve supplies the medial sole and medial three and one half toes through four digital branches. Each digital branch give off a dorsal branch to supply the nail beds on the dorsum. This nerve also gives off articular branches to supply the bones of the tarsus and metatarsus. * Lateral plantar nerve - It is the smaller terminal branch of the tibial nerve. It courses laterally and forward until the base of fifth metatarsal bone, where it divides into superficial and deep branches. Its distribution resembles to the distribution of ulnar nerve in the hand. The main trunk of the nerve supplies two muscles: flexor digitorum accessorius and abductor digiti minimi. This nerve also supplies the skin of the sole. The superficial branch is divided into medial and lateral branches. The lateral branch supplies three muscles: flexor digiti minimi, 3rd and 4th interossei, and the skin over the lateral side of the toe. The medial branch communicates with the medial plantar nerve and supplies the skin over the fourth interdigital cleft. The deep branch supplies the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th lumbricals, first and second plantar interossei and adductor hallucis. =Clinical Significance= Damage to the tibial nerve is rare, and is often a result of direct trauma, entrapment through narrow space or compression for long period of time. Damage results in loss of plantar flexion, loss of flexion of toes and weakened inversion (The tibialis anterior can still invert the foot).

The name roughly translates as \\"Joe's Basement\\" from Italian (buca, which literally means \\"hole\\" or \\"pit\\", can be a dialectal word in Tuscany for basement or cellar, and Beppo is a diminutive of the name Giuseppe). The chain of 81 establishments https://locations.bucadibeppo.com/index.html Buca di Beppo: All locations (76 company-owned, 5 franchises in UK)Buca di Beppo: Meet Buca is owned by Buca, Inc., which in turn is owned by Planet Hollywood. The chain is known for its vintage photographs hung closely spaced throughout the restaurant. Menu Slice of cake at a Buca di Beppo (March 2009). The food at Buca di Beppo is served family style, each item served √† la carte and shared among the dining party. Some locations also have a lunch menu, featuring individual-sized portions. Each room at Buca is themed, and all restaurants have a Pope table‚Äîthe largest single table, round, in a room by itself, with a bust of the Pope as centerpiece. In an attempt to boost sales during 2005, Buca introduced a Buca Mia menu, meaning \\"My Cellar\\", with less-expensive portions for two. Corporate history Phil Roberts founded Buca di Beppo in 1993 as an imitation of \\"red sauce joints\\", Italian-American family restaurants in the northeast United States. Not Italian himself, Roberts wanted his restaurant's stereotypical depiction of Italian-American culture to be \\"intentionally in bad taste, but good-natured bad taste\\". He hired Vittorio Renda, a Milanese chef, and Roberts's architect son decorated the restaurant with Italians' family photographs from flea markets. In 1996, a new CEO, Joseph Micatrotto, brought less exaggerated Italian-American cultural depictions, based on his family's history, to the chain as it prepared to go public. The first restaurant, named Buca Little Italy, was opened in the basement level of a Minneapolis apartment building in 1993 by Twin Cities restaurant company Parasole Restaurant Holdings. Five years later, it was spun off and renamed Buca di Beppo.Burl Gilyard, Buca di Beppo headquarters moving to Florida (update), Finance & Commerce, November 23, 2011, accessed May 4, 2015. By 1999, there were 20 locations when Buca, Inc. began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The chain continued to grow, but began to hit some rough spots a few years later. Business losses mounted, and in 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating the company over securities laws. Two top executives left the company, three Buca di Beppo sites were closed, and the company described those restaurants and the Vinny T's chain as \\"discontinued operations\\" in 4th quarter 2005 earnings statements. However, on May 22, 2006, the company announced that it would be keeping the Vinny T's stores, but converting them to Buca di Beppo locations. On September 25, 2006 Buca, Inc. sold their 11 Vinny T's of Boston restaurants to Bertucci's Corp. for $6.8 million. On June 7, 2006, Micatrotto and two other former Buca executives were charged with stealing more than US$200,000 from the company. On August 5, 2008, Planet Hollywood's parent company, Planet Hollywood International, Inc., agreed to purchase the Buca chain for US$28.5 million. Under terms of the deal, Buca became a wholly owned subsidiary of Planet Hollywood.Steve Alexander, Struggling Buca bought by Planet Hollywood , Minneapolis Star Tribune, August 5, 2008, Accessed August 23, 2008. Its founder, Robert Earl, restored Buca di Beppo's gaudy decor of photographs covering walls. The Buca di Beppo at Excalibur Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, opened in 2011. In 2011, Buca moved its headquarters from Minneapolis to Orlando, Florida, home of its parent company, citing financial incentives. In 2012, Rick Tasman was named CEO & President. In 2015, Rich Saultz was named the new CEO & President and is currently in that position. By 2016, the company had 100 locations in the U.S. and U.K. , the chain has 77 restaurants in 24 states; Honolulu is the highest-grossing location.

The disorder presents in one of three clinical forms: lethal neonatal, severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular and myopathic. First characterized in 1973 by DiMauro and DiMauro the adult myopathic form of this disease is triggered by physically strenuous activities and/or extended periods without food and leads to immense muscle fatigue and pain. It is the most common inherited disorder of lipid metabolism affecting the skeletal muscle of adults, primarily affecting males. CPT II deficiency is also the most frequent cause of hereditary myoglobinuria. Signs and symptoms The three main types of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency classified on the basis of tissue-specific symptomatology and age of onset. Among the few people diagnosed with CPT2, some have unknown and/or novel mutations that place them outside these three categories while remaining positive for CPT2. = Neonatal form = The neonatal form is the least common clinical presentation of this disorder and is almost invariably fatal in rapid fashion regardless of intervention. Symptomatic onset has been documented just hours after birth to within 4 days of life. Affected newborns typically experience respiratory failure, low blood sugar, seizures, liver enlargement, liver failure, and heart enlargement with abnormal heart rhythms leading to cardiac arrest. In most cases, elements of abnormal brain and kidney development are apparent, sometimes even at prenatal ultrasound. Infants with the lethal neonatal form usually live no longer than a few months. Neuronal migration defects have also been documented, to which the CNS pathology of the disorder is often attributed. = Infantile form = Symptomatic presentation usually occurs between 6 and 24 months of age, but the majority of cases have been documented in children less than 1 year of age. The infantile form involves multiple organ systems and is primarily characterized by hypoketotic hypoglycemia (recurring attacks of abnormally low levels of fat breakdown products and blood sugar) that often results in loss of consciousness and seizure activity. Acute liver failure, liver enlargement, and cardiomyopathy are also associated with the infantile presentation of this disorder. Episodes are triggered by febrile illness, infection, or fasting. Some cases of sudden infant death syndrome are attributed to infantile CPT II deficiency at autopsy. = Adult form = This exclusively myopathic form is the most prevalent and least severe phenotypic presentation of this disorder. Characteristic signs and symptoms include rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle fibers and subsequent release of myoglobin), myoglobinuria, recurrent muscle pain, and weakness. The myoglobin release causes the urine to be red or brown and is indicatory of damage being done to the kidneys which ultimately could result in kidney failure. Muscle weakness and pain typically resolves within hours to days, and patients appear clinically normal in the intervening periods between attacks. Symptoms are most often exercise-induced, but fasting, a high-fat diet, exposure to cold temperature, sleep deprivation, or infection (especially febrile illness) can also provoke this metabolic myopathy. In a minority of cases, disease severity can be exacerbated by three life-threatening complications resulting from persistent rhabdomyolysis: acute kidney failure, respiratory insufficiency, and episodic abnormal heart rhythms. Severe forms may have continual pain from general life activity. The adult form has a variable age of onset. The first appearance of symptoms usually occurs between 6 and 20 years of age but has been documented in patients as young as 8 months as well as in adults over the age of 50. Roughly 80% cases reported to date have been male. Biochemistry =Enzyme structure= The CPT system directly acts on the transfer of fatty acids between the cytosol and the inner mitochondrial matrix. CPT II shares structural elements with other members of the carnitine acyltransferase protein family. The crystal structure of rat CPT II was recently elucidated by Hsiao et al. The human homolog of the CPT II enzyme shows 82.2% amino acid sequence homology with the rat protein. Significant structural and functional information about CPT II has thus been derived from the crystallographic studies with the rat protein. In addition to similarities shared by the acyltransferases, CPT II also contains a distinct insertion of 30 residues in the amino domain that forms a relatively hydrophobic protrusion composed of two alpha helices and a small anti-parallel beta sheet. It has been proposed that this segment mediates the association of CPT II with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Moreover, the insert might also facilitate the shuttling of palmitoylcarnitines directly into the active site of CPT II after translocation across the inner membrane by virtue of its juxtaposition to the active site tunnel of the enzyme. =Catalytic mechanism= CPT II catalyzes the formation of palmitoyl-CoA from palmitoylcarnitine imported into the matrix via the acylcarnitine translocase. The catalytic core of the CPT II enzyme contains three important binding sites that recognize structural aspects of CoA, palmitoyl, and carnitine. Although kinetic studies are hindered by high substrate inhibition, strong product inhibition, very low Km values for the acyl-CoA substrates, and complex detergent effects with respect to micelle formation, studies have shown that CPT II demonstrates a compulsory-order mechanism in which the enzyme must bind CoA before palmitoylcarnitine, and then the resulting product palmitoyl-CoA is the last substrate to be released from the enzyme. The carnitine binding site is made accessible by the conformational change induced in the enzyme by the binding of CoA. This ordered mechanism is believed to be important so that the enzyme responds appropriately to the acylation state of the mitochondrial pool of CoA despite the fact that the concentrations of both CoA and acyl-CoA found in the matrix well exceed the measured km value of the enzyme (most CPT II will already have bound the CoA). The histidine residue (at position 372 in CPT II) is fully conserved in all members of the carnitine acyltransferase family and has been localized to the enzyme active site, likely playing a direct role in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. A general mechanism for this reaction is believed to involve this histidine acting as a general base. More specifically, this reaction proceeds as a general base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack of the thioester of acetyl-CoA by the hydroxyl group of carnitine. =Biochemical significance of disease-causing mutations= The majority of the genetic abnormalities in CPT II deficient patients affect amino acid residues somewhat removed from the active site of the enzyme. Thus, these mutations are thought to compromise the stability of the protein rather than the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Theories regarding the biochemical significance of the two most common mutations are noted below: *Ser113Leu Hsiao et al. theorize that this mutation may disturb the hydrogen-bonding between Ser113 and Arg 498 and the ion-pair network between Arg498 and Asp376, thereby indirectly affecting the catalytic efficiency of the His372 residue. Isackson et al. suggest that this mutation increases the thermolability of the enzyme, structurally destabilizing it. This is noteworthy in light of the fact that this mutation is associated with the exercise-induced adult form (i.e., rising core body temperature may exacerbate enzymatic defects leading to symptomatic presentation). Rufer et al. speculate that mutation of serine to the bulkier, hydrophobic leucine alters a critical interaction with nearby Phe117, ultimately modifying the position and environment of the catalytically important residues Trp116 and Arg498, reducing enzyme activity. *Pro50His This proline is 23 residues from the active site, and is located right below the hydrophobic membrane insert in the active CPT II enzyme. Hsiao et al. speculate that this mutation indirectly compromises the association between CPT II and the inner mitochondrial membrane and disturbs the shuttling of the palmitoylcarnitine substrate into the active site of the enzyme. =Enzyme activity and disease severity= The clinical significance of the biochemical consequences that result from the genetic abnormalities in patients with CPT II Deficiency is a contested issue. Rufer et al. support the theory that there is an association between level of enzyme activity and clinical presentation. Multiple research groups have transfected COS-1 cells with different CPT II mutations and found varying levels of reduction in enzyme activity compared with controls: Phe352Cys reduced enzyme activity to 70% of wild-type, Ser113Leu reduced enzyme activity to 34% of wild-type, and several severe mutations reduced activity to 5-10% of wild-type. However, most researchers are reluctant to accept the existence of a causal relationship between enzyme functionality and clinical phenotype. Two groups have recently reported a limited correlation (lacking in statistical significance) between the genotypic array and the clinical severity of the phenotype in their patient cohorts. There is a need for further explorations of this topic in order to fully assess the biochemical ramifications of this enzymatic deficiency. The rate of long-chain fatty acid oxidation in CPT II-deficient patients has been proposed to be a stronger predictor of clinical severity than residual CPT II enzyme activity. For example, one study found that although the level of residual CPT II activity in adult versus infantile onset groups overlapped, a significant decrease in palmitate oxidation was noted in the infantile group when compared to the adult group. This group concluded that both the type and location of CPT2 mutation in combination with at least one secondary genetic factor modulate the long-chain fatty acid flux and, therefore, the severity of the disease. Pathophysiology Carnitine is a hydrophilic natural substance acquired mostly through dietary meats and dairy products and is used by cells to transport hydrophobic fatty acids. The \\"carnitine shuttle\\"Nelson DL and Cox MM (2005). \\"Fatty Acid Catabolism\\" in Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, 4th Ed. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 631-55. is composed of three enzymes that utilize carnitine to facilitate the import of hydrophobic long- chain fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix for the production of energy via Œ≤-oxidation. *Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and catalyzes the esterification reaction between carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA to produce palmitoylcarnitine. Three tissue-specific isoforms (liver, muscle, brain) have been identified. *Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) is an integral inner mitochondrial membrane protein that transports palmitoylcarnitine from the intermembrane space into the matrix in exchange for a molecule of free carnitine that is subsequently moved back out of the mitochondria into the cytosol. *Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) is a peripheral inner mitochondrial membrane protein ubiquitously found as a monomeric protein in all tissues that oxidize fatty acids. It catalyzes the transesterification of palmitoylcarnitine back into palmitoyl-CoA which is now an activated substrate for Œ≤-oxidation inside the matrix. Image:Acyl-CoA from cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix.svg =Molecular genetics= Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. CPT II deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. CPT2 is the gene that encodes the CPT II enzyme, and it has been mapped to chromosomal locus 1p32. This gene is composed of 5 exons that encode a protein 658 amino acids in length. To date, sixty disease-causing mutations within the coding sequence of CPT2 have been reported in the literature, of which 41 are thought to result in amino acid substitutions or deletions at critical residues. Amino acid consequences of some reported mutations *Ser113Leu (338C>T) is the most common mild mutation observed in adult cases, it has an observed allelic frequency of 65% in adult cases, and both homozygous and heterozygous cases have been documented. *Pro50His (149C>A) is also relatively common in the adult form, with an allelic frequency of 6.5%. *Arg161Trp, Glu174Lys and Ile502Thr are other homozygous mild mutations associated with the adult form *Arg151Gln and Pro227Leu are examples of severe homozygous mutations that have been associated with the mutisystemic infantile/neonatal form of the disorder. *The 18 known severe mutations that result in prematurely truncated proteins lack residual CPT II activity are associated with the neonatal onset and are likely incompatible with life in most circumstances. *Val368Ile and Met647Val are polymorphisms have been linked to CPT II deficiency. These genetic abnormalities alone do not directly cause the disorder, but they seem to exacerbate the reduction in enzymatic efficiency when combined with one or more primary CPT2 mutations. Recent researchThuillier L et al. (2003). Correlation between genotype, metabolic data, and clinical presentation in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) deficiency. Hum Metab, 21: 493-501. found that mutations associated with a specific disease phenotype segregated to specific exons. In this study, infantile-onset cases had mutations in exon 4 or 5 of the CPT2 gene, while adult-onset cases had at least one mutation in exon 1 and/or exon 3. This group suggested that Ser113Leu (exon 3) and Pro50His (exon 1) might confer some sort of protective advantage against the development of the severe infantile phenotype in patients predisposed to develop the adult form of the disorder, since these two mutations have never been identified in cases of compound heterozygous infantile cases. In support of this theory, an independent group reported two cases where mutations that have been shown to cause the infantile (Arg151Gln) or neonatal (Arg631Cys) forms when homozygous instead were associated with the milder, adult-onset phenotype when present as compound heterozygous mutations with Ser113Leu as the second mutation.

The original design was modified to provide an armored cutter capable of wartime missions in addition to her primary mission of Aids to Navigation. Papaw was built in 1943 by the Marine Iron and Shipbuilding Company of Duluth, Minnesota. Commissioned 12 October 1943, she was assigned the home port of San Francisco, California. Papaw saw extensive duty during World War II establishing aids to navigation systems for the newly captured islands in the Pacific. After the war Papaw's home port was moved to Astoria, Oregon. In June 1949, Papaw was shifted to the warm waters of Miami, Florida where she assumed responsibility for the aids to navigation in the Florida Keys and the Caribbean. In 1954, Papaw was moved, this time to Charleston, South Carolina under the command of RJ Papp who would later become Commandant of the Coast Guard alongside William Jennings which the VA is named after. There she maintained buoys, shore stations, and towers. In October 1989 Papaw entered the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) at the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland. She arrived at her new home port of Galveston, Texas on June 18, 1991. Papaw services approximately 150 aids to navigation from Brownsville, Texas to Calcasieu, Louisiana. The ship carried out many missions throughout the Gulf of Mexico including: Search and Rescue, Drug and Contraband Interdiction, Environmental Protection, Military Readiness Exercises, and Buoy Deployment Operations with the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration. Papaw's main propulsion system was diesel electric. Two 700 hp General Motors E.M.D. diesel engines each drove a DC generator which provided electricity to the 550 volt Westinghouse main motor. At 1200 hp the main motor turned a single shaft to a maximum speed of . Electric power was supplied by two 200 kW generators each driven by a Detroit Diesel engine. A bow thruster was fitted during the 1989 Service Life Extension Program giving the Papaw greater maneuverability. The Papaw's main boom was hydraulically operated and had a maximum working load of 20 tons. Buoys serviced by the Papaw ranged from tiny nun buoys to the tall 18,000 lb Galveston Entrance Channel Buoy. Most buoys are equipped with electrical lights powered by batteries and solar cells. Some have sound signals, radar beacons, and elaborate power systems. All buoys are pulled from the water at least once a year for painting, maintenance, and position checks. The Papaw has received many awards during its history. Her wartime honors include: the World War II Victory Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and two National Defense Service Medals. Papaw has also received many peacetime commendations, these include: two Coast guard Meritorious Unit Commendations, a Humanitarian Service Medal, and a Coast Guard Special Operations Ribbon. Papaw was decommissioned on 23 July 1999 at Group Galveston, Texas. She was donated to Canvasback Missions of Benicia, California, a nonprofit organization. She is currently operating as the F/V Mersea, an emergency relief ship as part of the Friend Ships fleet. Her sister ship, the USCGC Conifer, is also part of the Friend Ships fleet as the F/V Hope.

It has a similar pathology to Sandhoff disease and Tay‚ÄìSachs disease. The three diseases are classified together as the GM2 gangliosidoses, because each disease represents a distinct molecular point of failure in the activation of the same enzyme, beta-hexosaminidase. AB variant is caused by a failure in the gene that makes an enzyme cofactor for beta-hexosaminidase, called the GM2 activator.  Symptoms and signs  Signs and symptoms of GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant are identical with those of infantile Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, except that enzyme assay testing shows normal levels of hexosaminidase A. Infantile Sandhoff disease has similar symptoms and prognosis, except that there is deficiency of both hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B. Infants with this disorder typically appear normal until the age of 3 to 6 months, when development slows and muscles used for movement weaken. Affected infants lose motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling. As the disease progresses, infants develop seizures, vision and hearing loss, mental retardation, and paralysis. An ophthalmological abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination, is characteristic of this disorder. This cherry-red spot is the same finding that Warren Tay first reported in 1881, when he identified a case of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, and it has the same etiology. The prognosis for AB variant is the same as for infantile Tay‚ÄìSachs disease. Children with AB variant die in infancy or early childhood.  Cause  Mutations in the GM2A gene cause GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The GM2A gene provides instructions for making a protein called the GM2 activator. This protein is required for the normal function of beta-hexosaminidase A, a critical enzyme in the nervous system that breaks down a lipid called GM2 ganglioside. If mutations in both alleles at this locus disrupt the activity of the GM2 activator, beta-hexosaminidase A cannot perform its normal function. As a result, gangliosides accumulate in the central nervous system until they interfere with normal biological processes. Progressive damage caused by buildup of gangliosides leads to the destruction of nerve cells. GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant is extremely rare. In contrast with both Tay‚ÄìSachs disease and Sandhoff disease, in which many mutant polymorphic alleles have been discovered, including pseudodeficiency alleles, very few GM2A mutations have been reported. When AB variant is reported, in often occurs with consanguineous parents or in genetically isolated populations. GM2A is expressed in many tissues, and the GM2 activator protein has been reported to have other cellular functions. Because AB variant is so rarely diagnosed, it is likely that most mutations of GM2A are fatal at the embryonic or fetal stage of development in homozygotes and genetic compounds, and thus are never observed clinically. Diagnosis Treatment History AB variant was first observed clinically shortly after the biochemical characterization of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease in 1969. The disease was initially thought to be caused by variant alleles of the HEXA gene, and Konrad Sandhoff designated it as AB variant in 1971. Enzyme assay tests of TSD patients revealed a few unusual false negative cases, patients who developed the disease, yet had normal enzyme activity. In other cases, parents who had not tested as carriers for TSD had children who nevertheless became ill with the symptoms of classic infantile TSD. It was eventually determined that GM2 gangliosidosis could be caused by mutations on three distinct genes, one of which was an activator protein. Disease caused by a mutation that disables this protein was termed AB variant. In 1992, the GM2A gene itself was localized to chromosome 5, and the precise locus was determined the following year.

The most famous game played at King George V was on September 14, 1985 when over 13,000 people witnessed Canada's 2‚Äì1 victory over Honduras to win the 1985 CONCACAF Championship; the match also qualified Canada for their first World Cup (Mexico, 1986). It was a momentous occasion and is considered to be the high point of Canadian soccer history. In 2008, KGV played host to the Challenge Cup and the Jubilee Trophy.

This fish is also known as dewfish, freshwater catfish, jewfish, and tandan. This species is a freshwater fish native to the Murray-Darling river system of eastern Australia. The scientific name for eel-tailed catfish comes from a name for the fish in an unidentified Aboriginal Australian language - Tandan - which Major Thomas Livingston Mitchell recorded on his 1832 expedition. Description Eel-tailed catfish commonly grow to about 50.0 centimetres (19.7 in) and weigh about 1.8 kilograms (4.0 lb). Fish of this species may grow up to about 90.0 cm (35.4 in) and weigh up to 6.0 kg (13.2 lb). Eel-tailed catfish may live up to about 8 years. Eel-tailed catfish have large head with thick and fleshy lips and tubular nostrils. The skin is tough and smooth. Body coloration in adults vary from olive-green to brown, black or purplish on their backs and white on the underside. A downturned mouth with fleshy lips surrounded by a number of barbels assist them with feeding. They are a solid, almost cylindrical, elongate fish, with the posterior half of their body tapering into a pointed eel-like tail. A continuous fin margin surrounds this tapering posterior half of the body. Their eyes are small. The eel-tail catfish has 4 pairs of barbels surrounding the mouth, and sharp serrated dorsal- and pectoral-fin spines which are venomous and can cause a very painful wound.Martin F. Gomon & Dianne J. Bray (2011) Freshwater Catfish, Tandanus tandanus. Fishes of Australia. Retrieved 29 Aug 2014. Ecology Eel-tailed catfish at Adelaide Zoo The eel-tailed catfish inhabits slow moving streams, lakes and ponds with fringing vegetation. It swims close to the sand or gravel bottoms. This species is more abundant in lakes than in flowing water. Though they are usually solitary, juveniles may form aggregations. The eel-tailed catfish is found in most freshwater habitats of the Murray-Darling river system except for the upland, sub-alpine and alpine headwaters of southern tributaries. It is also present in speciated but undescribed forms in several east coast systems in northern New South Wales due to natural river capture events. Juvenile eel-tailed catfish feed on zooplankton, and small insects, particularly chironomid larvae. Fish over about 100 mm also eat small fish while adults include shrimps, crayfish in the warmer months and midge larvae in winter. In addition, they eat mollusks and dragonfly, caddis and mayfly larvae. The eel-tailed catfish is host for a number of intestinal parasites including cestodes and nematodes.Couch, A.J.; 1983. Eel-tailed catfish spawn in spring and midsummer, when the water temperature increases to between 20-24 ¬∞C (68-75 ¬∞F. The nest is built about one or two weeks before spawning. They build large nests up to a metre in diameter with small stones and gravel, within which the eggs are laid. One parent, sometimes both, guard the eggs until they hatch. Conservation Freshwater Catfish were once widespread in eastern Australia, however, populations have suffered severe declines in both distribution and abundance since the 1980s. The Murray-Darling populations of eel-tailed catfish has declined significantly over recent decades. Most populations in the southern half of the Murray-Darling river system are extinct or nearly so. The species remains relatively common in coastal catchments from the Hunter River (NSW) north. Numerous factors are thought to have contributed to the decline of Freshwater Catfish populations in the Murray-Darling Basin since the 1970s. These include habitat degradation and barriers to movement, and increased predation by and competition with introduced species such as carp (which has similar feeding habits) and Redfin. Severe siltation also probably severely impacts upon the species spawning by smothering the rocks and pebbles they use to build nests. The Freshwater Catfish population in the Murray-Darling Basin is listed as: New South Wales Fisheries Management Act 1994: Endangered Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988: Threatened South Australian Fisheries Management Act 2007: Protected Populations in several rivers and impoundments in the northern half of the Murray-Darling appear secure for now. The species does well in the upland reaches of these northern Murray-Darling rivers; this is in contrast to its absence from the upland reaches of southern Murray-Darling rivers, where water temperatures are cooler.

Background Although Three Guineas is a work of non-fiction, it was initially conceived as a \\"novel‚Äìessay\\" which would tie up the loose ends left in her earlier work, A Room of One's Own.For an account of the development of Three Guineas see Jean Guiguet, Virginia Woolf and her Works (London: Hogarth, 1965). The book was to alternate between fictive narrative chapters and non- fiction essay chapters, demonstrating Woolf's views on war and women in both types of writing at once. This unfinished manuscript was published in 1977 as The Pargiters. When Woolf realised the idea of a \\"novel‚Äìessay\\" wasn't working, she separated the two parts. The non-fiction portion became Three Guineas. The fiction portion became Woolf's most popular novel during her lifetime, The Years, which charts social change from 1880 to the time of publication through the lives of the Pargiter family. It was so popular, in fact, that pocket- sized editions of the novel were published for soldiers as leisure reading during World War II. Structure and overview The entire essay is structured as a response to an educated gentleman who has written a letter asking Woolf to join his efforts to help prevent war. War was looming in 1936‚Äì7 and the question was particularly pressing to Woolf, a committed pacifist.Woolf, Virginia. A Writer's Diary: Being Extracts from the Diary of Virginia Woolf (London: Hogarth, 1959) In the gentleman's letter (he is never named), he asks Woolf her opinion about how best to prevent war and offers some practical steps. Woolf opens her response by stating first, and with some slight hyperbole, that this is \\"a remarkable letter‚Äîa letter perhaps unique in the history of human correspondence, since when before has an educated man asked a woman how in her opinion war can be prevented.\\"Woolf, Virginia. Three Guineas. (New York: Harvest, 1966) Despite the remarkable nature of the letter, Woolf has left it unanswered because as the daughter of an educated man, without access or place in the public world of professions, universities, societies, and government, she fears that there are fundamental differences that will make her \\"impossible for [educated men] to understand.\\" This sets up the fundamental tension of the work between, on the one hand, the desire to leave behind the stifling private home so as to help prevent war, an aim that Woolf certainly shares with her interlocutor, and, on the other, an unwillingness to simply ally with the public world of men. \\"Behind us lies the patriarchal system; the private house, with its nullity, its immorality, its hypocrisy, its servility. Before us lies the public world, the professional system, with its possessiveness, its jealousy, its pugnacity, its greed.\\" In the course of responding to the educated man's questions and practical suggestions, Woolf turns to two other letters: a request for funds to help rebuild a woman's college and a request for support for an organisation to help women enter the professions (professional life). Both allow Woolf to articulate her criticisms of the structure of education and the professions, which mostly involves showing how they encourage the very attitudes that lead to Fascism both at home and abroad. Woolf does not refuse the values of education and public service outright but suggests conditions which the daughters of educated men will need to heed if they are to prevent being corrupted by the public order. She imagines, for example, a new kind of college that avoids teaching the tools of domination and pugnacity, \\"an experimental college, an adventurous college‚Ä¶. It should teach‚Ä¶ the art of understanding other people's lives and minds‚Ä¶. The teachers should be drawn from the good livers as well as from the good thinkers.\\" In the final section, Woolf returns from the topics of education and the professions to the larger questions of preventing war and the practical measure suggested for doing so. In it she argues that although she agrees with her interlocutor that war is evil, they must attempt to eradicate it in different ways. \\"And since we are different,\\" Woolf concludes, \\"our help must be different.\\" Thus, the value of Woolf's opinion (and help) on how to prevent war lies in its radical difference from the ways of men. Its impossibility of being completely understood is, then, the condition of its usefulness. Themes Woolf wrote the essay to answer three questions, each from a different society: *From an anti-war society: \\"How should war be prevented?\\" *From a women's college building fund: \\"Why does the government not support education for women?\\" (Actually, the fund was a metaphor for family private funds to send the \\"boys of the family\\" to college and not the women.) *From a society promoting employment of professional women: \\"Why are women not allowed to engage in professional work?\\" The book is composed of Woolf's responses to a series of letters. The question and answer format creates a sense of dialogue and debate on the politically charged issues the essay tackles, rather than just presenting simple polemical diatribes on each topic. The principle of dialogue is one that informs much of Woolf's work, and is also seen in her novels when she gives voice to different classes and marginalised groups in society through a diversity of characterisations.Snaith, Anna. Virginia Woolf: Private and Public Negotiations. New York: St. Martin's Press. 2000. For example, the sky-writing scene in Mrs. Dalloway includes characters with a variety of class-influenced dialects. The \\"guineas\\" of the book's title are themselves a badge of social class, the money amount of 21 shillings (1.05 pounds sterling) for which no coin any longer existed, but which was still the common denomination for solely upper-class transactions (e.g., purchase of pictures or race-horses, lawyers' or medical specialists' fees, and so on.) The epistolary format also gives the reader the sense of eavesdropping on a private conversation.Snaith, Anna. \\"Three Guineas,\\" The Literary Encyclopedia. 2001. We listen in on Woolf's suggestions to a barrister on how to prevent war, to a women's league on how to support females in the professions, and to a women's college on how to encourage female scholarship. All three sources have written to Woolf asking for financial donations. What she donates, though, is her advice and philosophy. Woolf was eager to tie the issues of war and feminism together in what she saw as a crucial point in history. She and her husband Leonard had visited both Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in the early part of the decade. The ideology of fascism was an affront to Woolf's conviction in pacifism as well as feminism: Nazi philosophy, for example, supported the removal of women from public life. Reception = Contemporary responses = Q. D. Leavis (literary critic) wrote a scathing critique of Three Guineas shortly after its publication in 1938. She denounces the essay because it is only concerned with 'the daughters of educated men', seeing Woolf's criticisms as irrelevant to most women because her wealth and aristocratic ancestry means she is 'insulated by class'.Leavis, Q.D. \\"Caterpillars of the Commonwealth Unite!\\" Scrutiny (Sept 1938): 208 Elsewhere Three Guineas was better received. Woolf reports a favorable response in her diary of 7 May 1938. \\"I am pleased this morning because Lady Rhonda writes that she is profoundly excited and moved by Three Guineas. Theo Bosanquet, who has a review copy, read her extracts. And she thinks it may have a great effect, and signs herself my grateful outsider.\\" = Recent responses = The views expressed in Three Guineas have been described as feminist, pacifist, anti-fascist, and anti-imperialist.Jill Liddington. The Long Road to Greenham : Feminism and Anti-Militarism in Britain since 1820, London, Virago, 1989 (pp. 14‚Äì15). Feminist historian Jill Liddington has praised Three Guineas as \\"an eloquent and impish attack on patriarchal structures\\", notes how the book puts forward the argument that \\"men's power under patriarchy dovetails with militarism\\", and claims \\"Three Guineas offers an important bridge between the earlier feminist flowering and the later 1980s wave of a women's peace movement\\". In 2002, City Journal published a critique of Three Guineas by the conservative essayist Theodore Dalrymple, \\"The Rage of Virginia Woolf\\" (later reprinted in Dalrymple's anthology, Our Culture, What's Left of It), in which Dalrymple contended that the book is \\"a locus classicus of self-pity and victimhood as a genre in itself\\" and that \\"the book might be better titled: How to Be Privileged and Yet Feel Extremely Aggrieved\\". In response, Woolf scholar Elizabeth Shih defended Three Guineas and claimed Dalrymple's article was full of \\"ad hominem moments\\".Elizabeth Shih, \\"When Woolf Goes Missing (From Herself): The Surfeit of Short Articles on Virginia Woolf's Life and Work\\". Virginia Woolf Miscellany, Number 62, Spring 2003, (pp. 2‚Äì3). Shih argued that Dalrymple \\"obtusely and consistently misreads Woolf's hyperbole\\", interpreting literally Woolf's comments about burning male-dominated colleges, and Woolf's likening women using their sexuality to control men to prostitution. Shih also criticised Dalrymple's attacks on Woolf's anti-militarism and her calls for working-class education. Shih suggested Dalrymple's objection to Three Guineas was due to his opposition to Woolf's \\"politicization of the private lives of women\\".

His family were Tibetan nomads. At the age of five he was recognized \\"as a reincarnation of Lerab Lingpa (las rab gling pa, 1856-1926). Known also as Nyala Sogyel (nyag bla bsod rgyal) and Terton Sogyel (gter ston bsod rgyal), Lerab Lingpa was an eclectic and highly influential tantric visionary from the eastern Tibetan area of Nyarong (nyag rong).\\" He studied Dzogchen at Nubzor Monastery, received novice ordination at 14, and full ordination at 22 (or 1955). In 1980, he founded Larung Gar, the largest Tibetan Buddhist monastic academy. Jigme Phuntsok was the most influential lama of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism in contemporary Tibet (according to Khenpo Samdup who was his disciple). A Tibetan Buddhist meditation master and renowned teacher of Great Perfection (Dzogchen), he established the Sertha Buddhist Institute in 1980, known locally as Larung Gar, a non-sectarian study center with approximately 10,000 monks, nuns, and lay students at its highest count. He played an important role in revitalizing the teaching of Tibetan Buddhism following the liberalization of religious practice in 1980. Jigme Phuntsok was also an extraordinary Terton (Buddhist treasure revealer), uncovering many treasures texts in Tibet, as well as other parts of China, and India. In the 1990s, he began an appeal to traditional Tibetan yak herders to refrain from commercial sale of their livestock for spiritual and cultural reasons that has grown into the Anti-Slaughter Movement.  Biography  Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok was born in 1933, the third day of the first month of the year of the Water Bird, in Golog Serthar Amdo region of Tibet, or the rugged washul Sertar region of the Tibetan cultural region of Amdo, a vast expanse of high-plateau grasslands. He adopted Manjusri as his personal deity and he is said to have had visions of him several times, including once in 1987 when he visited Mount Wutai, the holy mountain abode of Majushri in China. At the age of five, Khenpo was recognized as the reincarnate of Tert√∂n Sogyal, guru to the 13th Dalai Lama Thubten Gyatsho, and became a monk at Nubzur Gonpa, a branch of the Palyul monastery in Sertar. He became increasingly interested in Dzogchen, received formal religious training under Thubga Rinpoche at Changma Rithro in Dzachukha, and was selected to become the Khenpo, or abbot, of Nubzur Monastery at the age of twenty-four. From the rise of the People's Republic of China, Khenpo‚Äôs spiritual path was greatly changed, to the point in 1959 he withdrew with a group of faithful monks into the remote Sertar mountains, and herded a small flock of goats and sheep. There he engaged in meditation and gave teachings to small numbers of people and was able to continue his spiritual practice, while apparently untouched by the violence and destruction of the Cultural Revolution. By its end in 1976, Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok's fame had grown exponentially. His teachings and his images circulated around the Tibetan plateau. In 1980, the 10th Panchen Lama visited Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok at his mountain retreat which evolved into the independent and private Sertar Buddhist Institute.In Tibetan Buddhist heartland, Communist Party takeover..., (25 August 2017), http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2108308/tibetan-buddhist- heartland-communist-party-takeover-threatens In 1987, Khenpo led hundreds of his students from Serthar Institute on a pilgrimage to the sacred mountains of Mount Wutai in China's Shanxi Province. En route in Beijing, he met again with the 10th Panchen Lama as he gave teachings on the 37 Practices of Bodhisattvas. During the meeting, the Panchen Lama blessed and officially endorsed Larung Gar and bestowed its name as Serta Larung Ngarik Nangten Lobling (gser rta bla rung lnga rig nang bstan blob gling), or Serta Larung Five Science Buddhist Academy. Khenpo's teachings during the pilgrimage helped open Tibetan Buddhism to students from beyond the plateau, after a gathering of over 5,000 people attended, including Tibetans, Chinese, Mongols, and other Buddhist practitioners. At Mount Wutai, the gatherings for Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok's teachings swelled to 10,000 on occasions. He also undertook retreats at sacred locations and in caves, and authorized the prolific treasure revealers Khandro TƒÅre Lama and Namtrul Jigme Puntsok. Khenpo made extensive travels across Tibet with the Panchen Lama, and to the rest of China teaching the Nyingma school's lineage and discovering hidden treasures. In 1990, after the invitations by the 14th Dalai Lama and Penor Rinpoche, he visited Nepal and India, where he taught at various monasteries, including the Nyingma Institute in Mysore. At Dharamsala, the 14th Dalai Lama gave and received empowerments and teachings with Khenpo for two weeks in a continuation of the 13th Dalai Lama's and Terton Lerab Lingpa's relationship. The same year, the Queen of Bhutan with Dilgo Khyentse invited Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok to visit, and teachings were given to the king. In 1993, Khenpo was invited by Buddhist Dharma centers to tour and teach in Europe and North America. There, he became disillusioned with the commercialization of Buddhist teachings in the West. Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok expanded his following during teaching tours in the United States, Canada, Germany, England, France, and during teaching tours in Asia at Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Financial offerings made to him during this tour funded a major building program at the institute. Chinese authorities repeatedly harassed Larung Gar. In 1999 and in 2001, Chinese authorities searched the premises, and began a \\"patriotic re-education\\" of resident monks and nuns in April 2000.

Afterward, around 8,000 students were expelled and 3,800 residences and meditation huts were demolished.

The TCHRD also states his personal physician Rigzin was barred from the hospital. Several sources report his health declined at the same time, but he returned to Larung Gar and continued teaching in 2002-2003. The International Campaign for Tibet reports the Serthar Public Security Bureau occupied monastic buildings at the Institute, and Chinese authorities kept Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok under constant surveillance.Charismatic Tibetan Buddhist leader Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok passes away, https://savetibet.org/charismatic-tibetan-buddhist-leader-khenpo-jigme- phuntsok-passes-away/ In late November 2003, his younger sister Ani Mundron died at Larung Gar.

Jigme Phuntsok‚Äôs Last Teaching, http://khenposodargye.org/?s=Jigme+Phuntsok  Serta Larung Five Science Buddhist Academy  Panorama of the Academy in S√™rtar, facing north Panorama of the Academy in S√™rtar, facing south Panorama of the Academy in S√™rtar, facing east Panorama of the Academy in S√™rtar, facing west In 1980, Jigme Phuntsok founded Larung Gar, known as Larung Gar Buddhist Academy and by its official name as bestowed by the 10th Panchen Lama, Serta Larung Ngarik Nangten Lobling (gser rta bla rung lnga rig nang bstan blob gling) or Serta Larung Five Science Buddhist Academy. Comprising several monastic and lay practitioner institutions, it is located in the Larung Valley near the town of S√™rtar, Garz√™ Prefecture, Sichuan Province. The purpose of the Academy has been to provide an ecumenical training in Tibetan Buddhism and to meet the need for renewal of meditation and scholarship all over Tibet in the wake of China‚Äôs Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. Despite its remote location, it grew from a handful of disciples gathering in Khenpo's home to be one of the largest and most influential centers for the study of Tibetan Buddhism in the world, numbering more than 10,000 monks, nuns, and lay disciples by the year 2000. Overall, the student body of the Academy was made up of monks, nuns, lay \\"vow-holders\\" of both Tibetan and Chinese origins, and tantric practitioners. They studied under four major religious divisions in the Institute: Ngarig Nangten Lobling, Pema Khandro Duling Nunnery, Lektso Charbeb Ling, and the International Religious Committee. Ngarig Nangten Lobling consisted of 2,500 Tibetan monks. Pema Khandro Duling Nunnery is the home for study to approximately 5,000 nuns, as of late 1990's, from all regions of Tibet. More than half of those who came to Serthar are women and the curriculum allowed nuns to achieve a coveted Khenpo degree, or Khenmo for women, for the first time in Tibetan history. Entry into the relatively small number of nunneries that exist in other areas of Tibet is limited, but Serthar was open to virtually anyone who genuinely sought to become a student of Jigme Phuntsok‚Äôs ecumenical vision. Khenpo‚Äôs niece, Jetsunma Mume Yeshe Tsomo, is recognized as the tulku of Khandro Mingyur Pelkyi Dronma (mkha' 'gro mi 'gyur dpal gyi sgron ma, d.u.), and heads the order of nuns. Also known as Ani Mumsto, in 2017 she was a director of the Sertar Institute.In Tibetan Buddhist heartland, Communist party takeover threatens..., (25 August 2017), http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2108308/tibetan-buddhist- heartland-communist-party-takeover-threatens Lektso Charbeb Ling is the section that trained over 1,000 lay Tibetan \\"vow-holders\\" and tantric practitioners from S√™rtar and other regions of Tibet. The International Religious Committee oversaw 1,000 disciples from regions of the People‚Äôs Republic of China and students from other Asian countries. Roughly ten percent of the nearly 10,000 students attending the Academy were ethnic Han people. Tibetologist Glenn Mullin said, \\"It is interesting to see how strong Tibetan Buddhism has become throughout China these days. There are small study and practice centers almost everywhere in the country. Some have become explosively huge, like Khenpo Jigmey Puntsok‚Äôs place in Kham, which always has well over 10,000 full time students and trainees in residence.\\" They attended separate classes taught in Standard Chinese while larger classes were taught in Standard Tibetan. Sertha Larung Five Science Buddhist Academy has operated with a standing executive committee of seven learned lamas, but major decisions were confirmed and implemented only after consultation with Jigme Phuntsok. The Academy has been home to over 500 khenpos‚Äîholders of Bachelor's degrees in divinity‚Äîand widely renowned for the high quality of both its religious and secular education. English, Chinese, and Tibetan languages and modern computer studies have been taught alongside traditional non-sectarian Buddhist curriculum.  Terma  \\"Terma\\" is a Tibetan term that means \\"treasures\\" and refers to Buddhist texts, ritual objects such as statues, or chests that may have been concealed by Padmasambhava or other Buddhist masters. Uncovering terma is a very important tradition of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism. In modern Tibet, Jigme Phuntsok was an intellectual and religious scholar as well as a famous Tert√∂n (treasure revealer). There are many mythic and charismatic stories of his ability to uncover Terma. In 1990, he discovered a sacred site that had been a palace of legendary King Gesar. That led to an archaeological dig that turned up ancient building stones and several treasure chests. His findings of new sacred sites and caves that related to previous Buddhas and reincarnations are numerous in Tibet. He also found holy places in other parts of world. During his visit to Mount Wutai in China and India, by miraculous signs he recalled memories of previous lives and discovered meditation retreat sites that were previously unknown. Jigme Phuntsok's ability to uncover Terma has played an important role in inspiring devotion in the revival of Tibetan Buddhism in contemporary Tibet. He is particularly known in the West for \\"A Branch of the Kilaya Tantra Gurkhukma called: The Sole Kilaya of the Sacred Bond of the Heart.\\"  Anti-slaughter movement  Jigme Phuntsok first started the Anti-Slaughter Movement in the 1990s, after seeing an increase in the slaughter rate of livestock from Tibetan households and in the way that livestock suffered in transportation to domestic Chinese markets. As a religious teacher, he requested traditional herders to reduce their sale of livestock to commercial markets or to stop altogether. His students and many other lamas made similar appeals to herders to refrain from selling their livestock for commercial slaughter. Large numbers of herders responded by taking an oath to stop for a period of three years (or forever). Today, the practice of herders vowing to refrain from commercial activity with their yak herds has built into a movement that began in Sertha and spread to the larger geographical areas of the Eastern Tibetan Plateau and into the ethnic Tibetan pastoral areas of Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, and Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR).  Relations with the government  During the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion he made the crucial decision to remain in Tibet rather than flee to India. Between 1960 and 1980 he returned to a nomadic lifestyle in order to avoid the Cultural Revolution. In 1980 Jigme Phuntsok founded the Serthar Buddhist Institute (also called the Larung Gar Buddhist Institute, near the town of S√™rtar (Chinese Seda). The Institute's popularity grew until there were 8500 students at the site, including about 1000 ethnic Chinese as well as students from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia. In 1987 Jigme Phuntsok met and befriended the 10th Panchen Lama. In 1989 he also met the 14th Dalai Lama, whom he refused to denounce, much to the chagrin of the Chinese Communist Party. After this the Chinese government refused him permission to travel for any reason for a period of time. Khenpo made extensive travels across Tibet and China, teaching and revealing terma. In 1990, at the invitation of Kyabj√© Penor Rinpoche, he visited India, where he taught at various monasteries, including the Nyingma Institute in Mysore. At Dharamsala, the Dalai Lama resumed the connections he and Khenpo had in their previous lives by receiving teachings from Khenpo for two weeks. In the summer of 1993, he visited various Dharma centres in India, Bhutan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, USA, Canada, and France, including Lerab Ling, where he gave empowerments and teachings including the empowerments of Tert√∂n Sogyal‚Äôs termas, Tendrel Nyesel and Vajrakilaya, as well as his own terma treasures of Manjushri and Vajrakilaya, and Dzogchen teachings. Around 1999 the Sichuan United Work Front pressed him on the issue of his support for the Dalai Lama, and demanded that he reduce the number of students at the Institute (either to 150 or to 1400, depending on reports). Jigme Phuntsok refused. In summer of 2001 several thousand members of the People's Armed Police and the Public Security Bureau descended on the site, razing its structures and dispersed its students. He was detained by the government and held incommunicado for a year, then released in poor health while reportedly under constant surveillance. In December 2003, Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok became ill during a teaching, was admitted to a hospital in Barkham and then moved to another hospital in Chengdu. The actual cause of his death at the military hospital in Chengdu is reported to remain a mystery.  Publications  * Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok.

It opened on May 21, 1978. Designed by Anton Schwarzkopf, it is one of eight flywheel-launched units manufactured for theme parks around the world. It was the first flywheel-launched roller coaster in the world, the oldest shuttle loop roller coaster still in its original location, and it is the last ride of its kind still operating in the United States. Unlike many other looping coasters, Montezooma's Revenge uses conventional lap bars to hold riders in the seats instead of modern over-the- shoulder restraints found on most other steel looping roller coasters. Following Cedar Fair LP's 1997 takeover of Knott's Berry Farm, fabric seat belts were added as a secondary restraint system. History Montezooma's Revenge was named after the bluegrass group, Montezuma's Revenge, a musical act that performed regularly in the wagon camp at Knott's Berry Farm. Based on the launch mechanism for aircraft carriers, the flywheel-launched shuttle loop is a successor of the drop-tower launch shuttle, and predates modern LIM and hydraulic launch systems by over 15 years. The drop tower models had a large silo with a weight inside connected to a similar launch system. The weight would drop, thus pulling the cable and bob, launching the train. Drawbacks included no adjustments for inclement weather. Also, the drop-tower launch was nowhere as intense as the flywheel launch, taking almost two seconds longer to reach the same speed. The nearby Jaguar! roller coaster, which opened in 1995, passes directly through the center of Montezooma's loop. In 2002, Montezooma's Revenge was repainted in a teal and yellow color scheme. In 2008, Knott's opened Pony Express, a small \\"out and back\\" steel roller coaster with a flywheel launch system much like Montezooma's Revenge. On June 20, 2019, Montezooma's Revenge was designated as a Roller Coaster Landmark by the American Coaster Enthusiasts, officially recognizing the ride as the last coaster of its kind in the United States and the longest standing in its original location. For 2019, Montezooma's Revenge was painted orange and yellow. Launch mechanism and safety features The ride uses a flywheel mechanism to accelerate the train to in 4.5 seconds. The train goes through a vertical loop, then ascends a spike and reverses direction. It passes through the station in reverse and ascends another spike behind the station. The flywheel, located outside the station and adjacent to the loop, is attached to a clutch and cable system, which in turn connects to a small four-wheeled catch car known as a \\"bob\\". On the front of the bob is a launch pin that seats in a socket in the back of the train. Once the bob is seated, the operators receive the ready light. Two operators are required to launch the train. After verifying that all passengers have secured their restraints and checking the exit stairs, one operator ascends a podium at the right front of the train. The other operator stands on a platform at the left rear. After verifying that the launch area is clear of personnel, the front operator gives a thumbs-up signal and says, \\"Clear dispatch.\\" Both operators must then press a button on their respective consoles simultaneously to launch. At launch, the clutch system engages the cable to the spinning flywheel, pulling the bob and train rapidly forwards. During the launch sequence, enough kinetic energy is removed from the flywheel to reduce its speed from approximately 1044 rpm to 872 rpm. The train negotiates a diameter vertical loop before ascending the front spike, then descends backwards, going through the loop a second time, running at full speed backwards through the station, and ascending the rear spike. It is at this point where the best \\"airtime\\" on the ride is experienced. The train then returns to its starting position after being slowed by 66 sets of brakes, 33 in the station and 33 to the rear of the station. Incidents Justine Dedele Bolia, a 20-year-old female tourist from the Republic of Congo, died on September 1, 2001, one day after riding Montezooma's Revenge. Bolia suffered a ruptured middle cerebral artery and an autopsy revealed a pre- existing condition. The ride was closed for several days while an investigation was conducted. Though state investigators concluded that the ride did not contribute to her death, a wrongful death lawsuit was later filed by her family in 2002. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2006.

Machiavellian ideology is often depicted \\"as godless, scheming and self-interested\\".\\"Machiavelli‚Äôs The Prince, British Library In discussions of Machiavelli's thought \\"Machiavellian\\" and \\"Machiavellianism\\" are often used in reasoned critiques, also in general usage the terms more often occur in political polemic, suggesting an unprincipled lust for power, achieved through \\"subtle policie, cunning roguerie\\" (the earliest dictionary definition in English, from 1611), by the \\"Machiavel\\", an adherent of these principles.Maus, 35-36, and the rest of Chapter 2 In this idea, as described by Isaiah Berlin, Machiavelli was regarded as \\"a man inspired by the Devil to lead good men to their doom, the great subverter, the teacher of evil, le docteur de la sc√©l√©ratesse, the inspirer of St. Bartholomew‚Äôs Eve, the original of Iago\\".The Question of Machiavelli, 4 November 1971, The New York Review of Books (reprinted in Against the Current as \\"The originality of Machiavelli\\"), quoted in Gotthelf, Harold, \\"Word of the Day: Machiavel\\", 1 June 2012 In particular English theatre saw a \\"'pseudo- Machiavellian' burlesque stage tradition. Its relation to Machiavelli's political doctrine \\"does not go much beyond its borrowing of the Florentine's name.\\"Ribner, see also \\"Marlowe and Machiavelli: For your Consideration\\", and Maus, 35 The English stage Machiavel is \\"a kind of person, not primarily an exponent of particular political views\\",Maus, 47 \\"a character who promulgates a false facade of virtue covering over an interiority of malevolent power- seeking\\".Grady, 46 According to one recent scholar, \\"the sixteenth-century stage image of Machiavelli as a proponent of political deception of and power- for-power's sake persists today, and for most readers the term 'Machiavellian' still carries negative connotations associated with this conception of him\\".Grady, 42 The word Machiavellian is widely used as a pejorative to characterize unscrupulous politicians of the sort Machiavelli advised most famously in The Prince. Machiavelli proposed that immoral behavior, such as the use of deceit and the murder of innocents, was normal and effective in politics. He also notably encouraged politicians to engage in evil when it would be necessary for political expediency.For example, The Prince chap. 15, and The Discourses Book I, chapter 9 The book gained notoriety due to claims that it teaches \\"evil recommendations to tyrants to help them maintain their power\\". In the 20th century the word \\"Machiavellianism\\" also became used in psychology as the name of a personality trait, one that is also included in the dark triad with narcissism and psychopathy. First appearances The early appearances of the word all relate to its political meaning. It first appears in English (in fact Scottish) in the work of Robert Sempill (d. 1595). He uses \\"mache villion\\" and \\"Machivilian\\". As \\"Machiauilisme\\" it occurs in Thomas Nashe's Pierce Peniless (1592). A French to English dictionary of 1611 gives \\"subtle policie, cunning roguerie\\" as the meaning. The Italian machiavellista and machiavello also go back to the 16th century.Note 16, Five Hundred Years of Italian Scholarship on Machiavelli's Prince The Oxford English Dictionary defines \\"Machiavellian\\" (as an adjective) as: \\"Of, pertaining to, or characteristic of Machiavelli, or his alleged principles; following the methods recommended by Machiavelli in preferring expediency to morality; practicing duplicity in statecraft or in general conduct; astute, cunning, intriguing\\".OED, \\"Machiavellian\\". The similar Merriam-Webster definition talks of conduct \\"marked by cunning, duplicity, or bad faith\\". A \\"Machiavel\\" is \\"One who acts on the principles of Machiavelli; an intriguer, an unscrupulous schemer\\".OED, \\"Machiavel\\" Reception of Machiavelli In so far as the Machiavellian idea has a great relationship with Machiavelli's philosophy, it relates to his most famous work, Il Principe, or The Prince. The book would become infamous for its recommendation for absolute rulers to be ready to act in unscrupulous ways, such as resorting to fraud and treachery, elimination of political opponents, and the usage of fear as a means of controlling subjects.The Prince, especially chapters VIII, XVII, and XVIII Machiavelli's view that acquiring a state and maintaining it requires evil means has been noted as the chief theme of the treatise.\\"We shall not shock anyone, we shall merely expose ourselves to good-natured or at any rate harmless ridicule, if we profess ourselves inclined to the old fashioned and simple opinion according to which Machiavelli was a teacher of evil.\\" -Leo Strauss, Thoughts on Machiavelli In the late 1530s, immediately following the publication of The Prince, Machiavelli's philosophy was seen as an immoral ideology that corrupted European politics. Reginald Pole read the treatise while he was in Italy, and on which he commented: \\"I found this type of book to be written by an enemy of the human race. It explains every means whereby religion, justice and any inclination toward virtue could be destroyed\\". Due to the treatise's controversial analysis on politics, in 1559, the Catholic Church banned The Prince, putting it on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Machiavelli's works were received similarly by other popular European authors, especially in Protestant Elizabethan England. The Anti-Machiavel is an 18th- century essay by Frederick the Great, King of Prussia and patron of Voltaire, rebutting The Prince. It was first published in September 1740, a few months after Frederick became king. Denis Diderot, the French philosopher, viewed Machiavellianism as \\"an abhorrent type of politics\\" and the \\"art of tyranny\\".Diderot, Denis (ascribed by Jacques Proust). \\"Machiavellianism.\\" The Encyclopedia of Diderot & d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project.

Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre One morning at the gates of the Louvre, 19th-century painting by √âdouard Debat-Ponsan, of the day after the Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre. Catherine de' Medici is in black. The Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre of Huguenot Protestants in France in 1572 was a particular nexus of complaints about Machiavellianism, as the massacre came to be seen as a product of it. The massacre \\"spawned a pullulating mass of polemical literature, bubbling with theories, prejudices and phobias\\", in which Machiavellianism featured prominently.Anglo, 229; See also: Butterfield, H. \\"Acton and the Massacre of St Bartholomew,\\" Cambridge Historical Journal, Vol. 11, No. 1 (1953), pp. 27-47 on the many shifts in emphasis of the historiography of the massacre over the next four centuries. This view was greatly influenced by the Huguenot lawyer Innocent Gentillet, who published his Discours contre Machievel in 1576, which was printed in ten editions in three languages over the next four years.Anglo, p. 283, see also the whole chapter Gentillet held, quite wrongly according to Sydney Anglo, that Machiavelli's \\"books [were] held most dear and precious by our Italian and Italionized courtiers\\" (in the words of his first English translation, Anti-Machiavel: A Discourse Upon the Means of Well Governing), and so (in Anglo's paraphrase) \\"at the root of France's present degradation, which has culminated not only in the St Bartholomew massacre but the glee of its perverted admirers\\".Anglo, p. 286 In fact there is little trace of Machiavelli in French writings before the massacre, and not very much after, until Gentillet's own book, but this concept was seized upon by many contemporaries, and played a crucial part in setting the long-lasting popular concept of Machiavellianism.Anglo, Chapters 10 and 11; p. 328 etc. It also gave added impetus to the strong anti-Italian feelings already present in Huguenot polemic. The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 endorsed a version of this view, describing the massacres as \\"an entirely political act committed in the name of the immoral principles of Machiavellianism\\" and blaming \\"the pagan theories of a certain raison d'√©tat according to which the end justified the means\\". English drama Christopher Marlowe was one of many Elizabethan English writers who were enthusiastic promoters of the concept, and although Machiavelli had not yet been published in English, he evidently expects his theatrical audience to understand the references. In The Jew of Malta (1589‚Äì90) \\"Machiavel\\" in person speaks the Prologue, claiming to not be dead, but to have possessed the soul of the Duke of Guise, considered the mastermind of the Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre, \\"And, now the Guise is dead, is come from France/ To view this land, and frolic with his friends\\" (Prologue, lines 3-4)Project Gutenberg Jew of Malta text. His last play, The Massacre at Paris (1593) takes the massacre, and the following years, as its subject, with Guise and Catherine de' Medici both depicted as Machiavellian plotters, bent on evil from the start. The figure of the Machiavel in Elizabethan drama \\"combined elements of the Vice character (the comic villain from medieval morality drama) with a negative caricature of Machiavellian ideology as godless, scheming and self-interested.\\" No English translation of The Prince was printed until 1640, but English manuscript translations were circulating by about 1585, as well as printed editions in other languages. Shakespeare may well have been aware of at least some of Machiavelli's ideas; he has the future Richard III boast in Henry VI, Part III, that he can \\"set the murderous Machiavel to school\\",\\"Machiavelli‚Äôs The Prince, British Library and the Host in the Merry Wives of Windsor asks rhetorically, \\"Am I politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel?\\" Other examples are Lorenzo in Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy, Iago in Othello, the title character of Ben Jonson's Volpone, and Boscola in John Webster's Duchess of Malfi.Maus, listing others, and key texts. The Machiavellian Earl of Essex The two levels of Machiavellianism both feature in the case of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, a favourite of Elizabeth I of England. There is good evidence that he and his circle, which included Francis Bacon and his brother Anthony,Grady, 31 were interested in a serious and informed way in the thought of Machiavelli.Grady, 27-28, 39-41 The famous climax of Essex's career was Essex's Rebellion in 1601, when he attempted a coup d'etat in London, which was a complete failure, flopping in a single day. He was executed within three weeks, with some of his co- conspirators following later. The government issued instructions to the nation's preachers a week after the rebellion on how to present the earl's character, which resorted to the theatrical caricature, saying he \\"was, in a word, a theatrical machiavel\\". The Privy Council's briefing included: \\"he has carried himself after a very insolent and ambitious sort ... he has diligently trodden the steps of all arch-traitors, seeking by popular conversation to allure the hearts of the simple. In matters of religion, his dissimulation and hypocrisy are now disclosed...\\".Grady, 30 Francis Bacon rapidly changed sides after the rebellion, taking part in Essex's prosecution, and referred to Machiavelli during Essex's trial, in a way that showed his familiarity with his actual writings, demonstrated at many points in his own writings.Grady, 38-39 Notes References * Anglo, Sydney (2005), Machiavelli ‚Äì the First Century: Studies in Enthusiasm, Hostility, and Irrelevance, Oxford University Press, , Google Books *Grady, Hugh, Shakespeare, Machiavelli, and Montaigne: Power and Subjectivity from Richard II to Hamlet, 2002, Oxford University Press, , 9780199257607, Google books *Maus, Katharine Eisaman, Inwardness and Theater in the English Renaissance, 1995, University of Chicago Press, , 9780226511238, Internet Archive *Ribner, Irving. \\"Marlowe and Machiavelli\\", Comparative Literature, vol. 6, no. 4, 1954, pp. 348‚Äì356, JSTOR Further reading *Watson, George. \\"Machiavel and Machiavelli\\", The Sewanee Review, vol. 84, no. 4, 1976, pp. 630‚Äì648, JSTOR External links *Machiavelli, Niccol√≤ -- Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy *Niccolo Machiavelli, Encyclopedia Britannica Category:16th-century neologisms Category:Eponymous political ideologies Category:Political history ","title":"Machiavellianism (politics)"},{"id":"2525857","text":"The building of Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin Kollel Gur Aryeh is a kollel for young married Orthodox men located in Brooklyn, New York.

But the weight of evidence strongly suggest they and their closest relatives are better separated as Tityridae; the AOU for example advocates this separation.Mobley (2004), SACC (2007) Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the black- tailed tityra in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected Cayenne in French Guiana. He used the French name La pie-griesche gris de Cayenne and the Latin Lanius Cayanensis cinereus. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the black-tailed tityra. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Lanius cayanus and cited Brisson's work. The species is now placed in the genus Tityra that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816. Two subspecies are recognized; they are sometimes treated as distinct species but widely intergrade where their ranges meet: * T. c. cayana (Linnaeus, 1766) - Northern South America east of the Andes, from Trinidad across the Amazonas basin to Piau√≠ and Mato Grosso (Brazil) and adjacent Bolivia. :Red bill base wide. Male greyish on back. Female with distinct brownish cap and little streaking on breast and back; throat white. * T. c. braziliensis (Swainson, 1838) - Piau√≠, Mato Grosso and adjacent Bolivia southeastwards to Misiones and possibly Corrientes Province (Argentina) :Red bill base narrow. Male white on back. Female lacks distinct cap, streaked strongly on entire head, neck, back and underside. Description This is a short-tailed robust bird with a long hook-tipped bill; like other tityras it has a peculiar vestigial ninth primary feather. The adult black-tailed tityra is about long and weighs about . The male is dull white above and white below. The rectrices, the primary and secondary remiges and a cap extending to below the eyes are black; the tertiary remiges are silvery grey. Females have dark brown rather than black on wings and tail and some brown pattern on head, back and underside. In both sexes there is a patch of rosy-red bare skin around the eye, extending to the bill which is red-based with a black tip. The iris and feet are dark. The juvenile plumage is unknown.Mobley (2004) =Voice= This species has a buzzing short call rendered as ed, rek, urd or wenk. A double beeza-buzza and triple weenk, weenk, weenk are also given. It more frequently calls in flight than when perched. Distribution and habitat This bird is found as a year-round resident in forest edges, second growth and plantation shade trees in the pantanal and cerrado as well as in terra firme and v√°rzea forest, usually below but occasionally as far up as ASL. Behaviour Black- tailed tityras are most commonly seen in pairs, or, less frequently, single or in small groups; they are intolerant of other birds and will try to chase them away. They are often seen perched conspicuously as they feed on medium-sized fruits. Food is gleaned from vegetation or picked off in mid-hover. While some large insects are caught, these are mainly fed to young birds; adults are predominantly frugivores and locally important dispersers of such species as the Meliaceae Cabralea canjerana. This species rarely attends mixed-species feeding flocks even when provisioning young, preferring to forage for insects on its own high up in the trees.Machado (1999), Mobley (2004) Its main breeding season appears to be from November to March across its range, but occasional nesting birds can be encountered almost year-round at least in some regions. For example, in the lowlands of Colombia and Ecuador, breeding activity has been reported in June and July also, suggesting either lack of a distinct breeding season and/or that two broods may be raised per year. The nest is several meters above ground in a tree hole, such as an old woodpecker nest or the crown of a dead palm tree. The brown-marked buff eggs are laid in a bed of dry leaves and some small twigs. Three eggs are considered likely, but exact clutch size is uncertain. Only the female incubates for almost three weeks until the young hatch, but both parents feed the chicks. Fledging is believed to take at least 3 weeks, perhaps as much as one month.Greeney et al. (2004), Mobley (2004) This species is one of the many hosts of the brood parasitic shiny cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis). It is not uncommon across its large range and occurs in many national parks and other protected areas. Therefore, it is considered a species of least concern by the IUCN.Mobley (2004), BLI (2008) References Sources * Greeney, Harold F.; Gelis, Rudolphe A. & White, Richard (2004): Notes on breeding birds from an Ecuadorian lowland forest.

Early life He was born on November 13, 1853, in Elmira, New York, the son of Newton Pomeroy Fassett and Martha Ellen (Sloat) Fassett. He attended the public schools of Elmira and graduated from the University of Rochester in 1875. He studied law at his father's firm, Smith, Robertson & Fassett, was admitted to the bar in 1878 and commenced practice in Elmira. He was District Attorney of Chemung County in 1878 and 1879. On February 13, 1879, he married in Sacramento, California, Jennie Louise Crocker (1860‚Äì1939), the daughter of Judge Edwin B. Crocker. Around this time Fassett became the proprietor of the Elmira Daily Advertiser. Afterwards he enrolled as a law student at Heidelberg University in Germany. He returned to Elmira in 1882 and began the practice of law. Political career Fassett's residence in Washington, D.C., while serving in the U.S. House of Representatives Greycourt, West Falmouth, MA, view from Wright Street and Little Island Road Fassett was a member of the New York State Senate (27th D.) from 1884 to 1891, sitting in the 107th, 108th, 109th, 110th, 111th, 112th, 113th and 114th New York State Legislatures; and was President pro tempore from 1889 to 1891.

He was elected as a Republican to the 59th, 60th and 61st United States Congresses, holding office from March 4, 1905, to March 3, 1911. His last political role was as Chairman of the Republican advisory convention in 1918. After retiring from politics, he resumed his work in the banking and lumber business in Elmira. He died on April 21, 1924 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, while returning from a business trip to Japan and the Philippines. He was an investor in various mines among which was the Oriental Consolidated Mining Corporation in Korea, which was managed by his cousin, Spokane politician and metallurgist Charles M. Fassett. He was buried at the Woodlawn Cemetery in Elmira.  Legacy  Fassett, Quebec - The village of Fassett, Quebec in Canada is named after him.

One of its subspecies, Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus, includes a diverse variety of cultivated radishes. The species is native to western Asia, Europe and parts of Northern Africa. It has been introduced into most parts of the world and is regarded as a habitat threatening invasive species in many areas, for example, Australia. It spreads rapidly and is often found growing on roadsides or in other places where the ground has been disturbed. Description Wild radish grows as an annual or biennial plant, with a single taproot which is similar to that of the cultivated radish but less enlarged. It has basal leaves that are oblong-elliptic to spatula-shaped, the stem leaves are shorter and lobed. It has hairy stems and can grow to between tall. It blooms between May and September, in the UK, or between June and August, in the US. The flowers very similar to those of the searocket, which is found in some of the same regions (in the US) and is easily distinguished from it by having thinner, non-succulent stems and leaves. The stems have wide spaced, four-petalled flowers across and varying in colour, usually from white to purple but sometimes light orange to yellow, often with colour shading within a single petal. Later, on a short stalk, it produces a podded seed capsule. Up to 8 round jointed pods, each containing one round or oval seed. Taxonomy It was formally described by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in his seminal publication 'Species Plantarum' on page 669 in 1753. The genome of wild radish is estimated to be ~515 Mb. Approximately 49% of the genome (254 Mb) has been sequenced. researchers found evidence of a past whole-genome triplication in wild radish followed by widespread gene loss, resulting in ~38,000 genes in the genome of the extant species. It has 3 known subspecies such as; * Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. landra (Moretti ex DC.) Bonnier & Layens * Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. rostratus (DC.) Thell. * Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus (L.) Domin It has several common names including jointed charlock, jointed radish, jointed wild radish, sea radish, white charlock, and wild radish. It is often erroneously identified as mustard. Distribution and habitat Yellow form flower of Wild Radish Wild Radish in Behbahan It is native to temperate regions of North Africa, Europe and parts of Western Asia. =Range= It is found in North Africa, within Macaronesia, Madeira Islands, Canary Islands, Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. Within Western Asia it is found in the Caucasus, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey. In eastern Europe, it is found within Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine. In middle Europe, it is in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland. In northern Europe, in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom. In southeastern Europe, within Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia. Also in southwestern Europe, it is found in France, Portugal and Spain. Ecology Seed pod of Raphanus raphanistrum Fruit (Western Australia) It is frost hardy, and even hard freezes only temporarily interrupt bloom. In Australia, it is regarded as a habitat threatening invasive species in many areas. In Canada, it is a naturalised species and sometimes hybridizes with cultivated radish, R. sativus. It has also proved to be resistant to several herbicides. In southeastern USA, the pale yellow form is common, sometimes entirely taking over fields in wintertime. It is a significant source of pollen and nectar for a variety of pollinators, especially honey bees during the very early spring starting buildup. Female Andrena agilissima, or mining bees, frequent this plant to obtain pollen and nectar. Other pollinators include cabbage butterflies and a few syrphid fly species.  Uses  All tender parts of the plant are edible, but its roots are too tough. The leaves and flowers have a spicy taste or aftertaste. The seedpods can be eaten, as can the outer skin of the root (after being washed).

Oastler was born in Sydney, Australia. A keen motorsport enthusiast and driver from a young age, he earned a first class honours degree in mechanical engineering from the New South Wales University of Technology. Oastler embarked on a driving career in the early 1980s, and was particularly successful in the Australian Formula Ford championship. Deciding to try his luck in the European motorsport scene, Oastler relocated to England in 1985, but without any real financial back found it very tough to campaign in any series there. He was working as a mechanic for Milldent Motorsport in Leicestershire in exchange for part-time drives in British Formula Ford 2000 when his engineering talents were recognised and he joined the Reynard company as a designer. Oastler was responsible for many designs at Reynard in racing categories such as Formula Ford, Formula Ford 2000, Formula 3000 and IndyCar. Oastler's Reynard design for the first Formula 3000 series was especially strong, and his chassis design went on to win five international titles. After the Formula 3000 success, Oastler led the IndyCar design from the start of the project. His Reynard 95I chassis went on to win eight races in total, including the Indy 500 and started from pole position no less than thirteen times. In 1998 Oastler was seconded to the newly formed BAR team in a chief designer role. As such he was responsible for all design and enhancement work done on the 1999 BAR 01 car, and also much work done on the 1998 Tyrrell 026. (BAR was founded on the remains of the Tyrrell F1 team and actually competed under the Tyrrell name for the 1998 season. The name British American Racing was first seen on the track for the 1999 season.) During the 1999 season Oastler was promoted to the role of technical director, but that role reverted to the BAR-partnered Reynard company in 2000 which left Oastler back at the chief designer position. BAR management was taken over by David Richards for 2002 and Oastler soon found himself out of the team. During that season he resurfaced at Jaguar Racing and worked on their upcoming R4 chassis for the 2002 season, and was named Jaguar's chief engineer for 2003 and 2004. During the Jaguar F1 team's tumultuous final season in 2004, Oastler decided to retire from professional motorsport and has since returned to his native Australia to set up several rural ventures. Oastler is married to Joanna and has three daughters, Charlotte, Chloe and Kate.

A great-grandson of Tsar Nicholas I, he was born in Imperial Russia and served in the army during World War I. He lost much of his family during the war and the Russian Revolution. He narrowly escaped execution by the Bolsheviks and spent the rest of his life living in exile in France.  Early life  Prince Gabriel Constantinovich was born on 15 July 1887 at Pavlovsk Palace in Pavlovsk. He was the second son among the nine children of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia and his wife Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mavrikievna of Russia) (born Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg). Gabriel and his brother Prince Ivan, born a year earlier, were the first to suffer the effects of the reforms of Emperor Alexander III, his father's cousin, who decreed that in the name of economizing the state budget, only the children and grandchildren of the reigning sovereign would bear the title of grand duke. Gabriel was three days old when Tsar Alexander III issued a manifesto announcing his title as a Prince of the Imperial Blood with the style of Highness. Grand dukes received 280,000 gold rubles annually from the imperial treasury, which guaranteed a comfortable life. Gabriel given a one-time sum of 1 million gold rubles, and he could count on nothing else. Gabriel spent his early life living in fabulous splendor on the last period of Imperial Russia. His father, a respected poet, was a first cousin once removed of Tsar Nicholas II, and one of the wealthiest members of the Romanov family. As a child, Gabriel was frail and or poor health; he was pale and prone to illness. He and Ivan were both often sick and together spent more than a year of their childhood living at Oreanda in the Crimea, with a doctor and several servants. Their health improved in the temperate climate, and the boys enjoyed their time spent on the beaches and in short tours around the peninsula. With only each other, for company, they forged a strong sibling relationship that was to last to the ends of their lives. Prince George, Prince Igor, Prince Oleg, Prince Constantine, Princess Tatiana, Prince Gabriel, Prince Ioan, Grand Duchess Elisabeth Mavrikievna and Grand Duke Konstantin, 1905 Gabriel was brought up strictly; he and his siblings were taught to speak pure Russian without a mixture of foreign phrases, and they had to memorize prayers. The best writers and musicians were invited to Pavlovsk and the Marble Palace, and Grand Duke Konstantin devised a programme of lectures for his children, providing a good education for them. From a very early age, Gabriel was passionately devoted to his father and to all things military. Following his father's example, Gabriel Constantinovich chose a military career, traditional for the male members of the Romanov family. In his memoirs, he recalled: Since the age of seven, I dreamed of entering the Nikolaevsky Cavalry School. In 1900, he was allowed to join the 1st Moscow Cadet corps as preparatory training; in 1903 he finally received permission to join the Nikolaevsky school. \\"Having worn a cadet's uniform for five years,\\" he wrote, \\"at last my dream came true, and I became a real military man.\\" At 19, he was promoted to officer's rank and awarded several orders. On 19 January 1908 Gabriel Constantinovich took his oath of allegiance to Nicholas II in a ceremony held in the church of the Catherine Palace at Tsarskoye Selo. His family was close to Nicholas II, and he spent many times with the emperor and his family. Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and her brother, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, were often his playmates.  A Russian prince  Prince Gabriel Constantinovich in his youth Unlike his serious and reserved brothers, Gabriel was much more social, and began to associate with an aristocratic crowd considered fast by the standards of the day. In August 1911, during a small ball at the mansion of the famous ballerina Mathilde Kschessinskaya, Gabriel met Antonina Rafailovna Nesterovskaya (14 March 1890 ‚Äì 7 March 1950), a 21-year-old dancer and member of an impoverished family from the lesser nobility. Gabriel was 24 years old, very tall and thin. Nesterovskaya was nearly a foot shorter than he was, plain and plump, but she was witty and lively. Gabriel fell in love with the ballerina. He managed to speak to her during the intervals while she was dancing at the Mariinsky Theatre every Sunday. By January 1912, he was visiting Nesterovskaya in the little apartment where she lived with her mother. They became lovers and before Easter 1912, they joined Kschessinskaya and her lover Grand Duke Andrew Vladimirovich on a trip to the Riviera, staying in Cannes and Monte Carlo. The Riviera idyll did not last long, because they soon had to return to Saint Petersburg, where the prince was studying. From then on, he considered her as his fianc√©e. In 1913, he asked her to quit the Ballet Corps and she agreed. Gabriel was devoted to his mistress and installed her in an extravagant house he purchased for her on Kamennoostrovsky Prospekt in Saint Petersburg. Meanwhile, Gabriel, who had been living in the Pavlovsk Palace, received a large three-room apartment at the Marble Palace on the second floor looking on the Palace Banks. After the death of his father in 1915, Gabriel was increasingly involved with his mistress. They were a hospitable couple and kept an open house entertaining lavishly for their friends. Gabriel was devotedly in love, but he could not marry his mistress because the Romanov's family status forbade any morganatic union. He appealed to his aunt, Olga, Queen of the Hellenes, to intercede on his behalf, and she went to see Nicholas II requesting permission for his nephew to marry, but the emperor flatly refused. Through the twists and turns of the years that followed, Prince Gabriel remained passionate in his devotion to the dancer, determined that one day he would overcome the obstacles and marry her. He was awarded Serbian Order of Karaƒëorƒëe's Star in 1911.  War and revolution  Prince Gabriel Constantinovich in uniform At the outbreak of World War I, Gabriel had to be separated from his mistress. He and four of his brothers joined the active Russian army in the military effort, fighting in advance operations. His brother Prince Oleg was killed in action at the beginning of the war. The following year, Gabriel's father died of a heart attack. Evacuated to Petrograd in the fall of 1914, he joined the military academy, graduating at the age of 29 with the rank of colonel. His affair with Nesterovskaya continued openly and was discussed publicly. The two lived together for a long time, and in 1916 Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, seeing the sincerity of their feelings, decided to help them get married even though it was considered a misalliance. After the overthrow of the Russian monarchy in the February Revolution of 1917, Prince Gabriel asked his mother for permission to marry Antonina Nesterovskaya, but she did not give him her consent. He decided to disobey, and on 9 April 1917 at three o'clock pm in a little church, they married. A morganatic union would have never been allowed under the reign of Nicholas II and Gabriel kept his marriage secret from both his mother and his uncle Dimitri Konstantinovich, who only later learned of the wedding. Gabriel had asked his cousin Prince Alexander of Leuchtenberg (who himself intended to marry morganatically), to find a priest to bless the wedding secretly. At the wedding ceremony, only Lidia Chistyakova (Antonina's sister) and a few of their friends were present. Gabriel had told his secret to his brother Ivan a few days before, but his elder brother did not want to attend the ceremony because of their mother. However, he promised to keep the secret. On his way to the church, Gabriel saw his brothers Prince Constantine and Prince Georgy walking on Morskaya Street. They had just met Antonina in a wedding dress in another car. Only later, the two brothers realized what had happened. Once married, Gabriel went to see his mother who, although she was very upset, at the end gave him her blessing. From then on Gabriel moved into Nesteroskaya's apartment where for a time, the couple lived quietly. Gabriel tried to keep a low profile in Petrograd during the spring 1917. Fearing a vengeful mob, Antonina telephoned to warn him. She dispatched a car and driver to collect him from the Military Academy and spirit him to the relative safety of her house.  Captivity  Prince Gabriel Constantinovich in civilian clothes After the successful Bolshevik coup of November 1917, the Petrograd newspapers published a decree summoning all male Romanovs to report to the Cheka, the secret police. Initially they were just required not to leave the city. In March 1918, the Romanovs who registered were summoned again, now to be sent away into internal Russian exile. In the spring of 1918, when the Bolsheviks had initially tried to arrest him, Gabriel was suffering from tuberculosis; rather than imprison him, the Bolsheviks allowed him to stay with his wife, Antonina, at her Petrograd apartment. By the summer of 1918, however, he had recovered, and one day in July, a contingent of armed soldiers arrived at the modest apartment and took him into custody. He was put in Shpalernaya prison in a cell adjoining those of his uncle Dimitri Konstantinovich and Grand Dukes Nicholas Mikhailovich and George Mikhailovich. Gabriel, younger and more resilient than his relatives, found prison less of an ordeal, but he was shocked at his uncle's appearance when they were first reunited. Until the last, Gabriel recalled, Dimitri was the cheerful favorite uncle of his childhood, telling him jokes, attempting to raise the spirits, and bribing prison guards to carry hopeful messages to his nephew's cell. Throughout Gabriel's incarceration Antonina was tireless in her efforts to obtain her husband's release. She finally succeeded with the intervention of Maxim Gorky, who lobbied Vladimir Lenin on Gabriel's behalf, as Gorky's wife was among Antonina's friends. Near the end of 1918, Gabriel was moved to a hospital. Shortly after, Gorky took the couple under his own roof; they lived for a while in his apartment in Petrograd. A few weeks later, again with Gorky's assistance, the Petrograd Soviet gave the couple permission to leave Russia for Finland. They hurriedly left Russia and made their roundabout way to France. The prince's release came just in time. In the early hours of 28 January 1919, his relatives at Shpalernaya prison were executed by firing squad at the walls of the Peter and Paul Fortress.  Exile  Prince Gabriel Constantinovich of Russia with his wife Antonina Nesterovskaya, created Princess Romanovskaya-Strelninskaya in exile In 1920, Prince Gabriel and his wife took residence in Paris, where many members of the Russian nobility settled. The couple did not lose interest in society once they were in exile. They were constant attendees at many Russian balls, frequently enjoyed evenings out in Russian nightclubs, and continued their friendship with other Romanovs in exile. Their circle included Tamara de Lempicka, who painted a famous portrait of Gabriel in 1927. By 1924, Gabriel's economic situation was very difficult. Antonina, having considered then rejected the idea of opening a ballet school, instead turned to the world of couture, and established her own fashion house. Christened the House of Berry, the shop opened in a small building. Five years later after achieving some measure of success, Antonina was able to move the shop to a more fashionable location. When Antonina received important or wealthy clients, especially American millionaires, they were quickly whisked to a salon where, surrounded by the trappings of imperial Russia, they were entertained by Gabriel Constantinovich himself, who seemed to relish the experience. Visitors later recalled that the prince frequently spent hours with them, often lecturing them on members of the extended family and using his photographs and paintings as visual aids to a vanished era. Gabriel and his wife, with the proceeds from their successful couture business, lived a comfortable, if not splendid life. Their entire hallways in their apartment were filled with family photographs. They lived happily and often had tea parties. In Paris, they often mingled with other Russian √©migr√©s, including Prince Felix Yussupov, and his wife, Princess Irina Alexandrovna, and Grand Duke Andrew Vladimirovich, by then married to Mathilde Kschessinskaya. The Great Depression eventually marked a sharp turn in the fortune of their fashion business, and they had to close the shop in 1936. The couple lived very modestly in a Paris suburb, where Prince Gabriel wrote his memoirs. To earn money he organized bridge parties and his wife occasionally gave ballet lessons. A portion of Prince Gabriel's memoirs was later published as In the Marble Palace; the book appeared first in both Russian and French. A number of Russian editions have appeared over the years, the most recent in 2001. However, it took time for the memoirs to be published in English, because a first English translation was allegedly lost in the bombing of the American Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1984. Gabriel's memoirs provide a detailed account of the private day-to-day lives of members of the Romanov family and have been sourced for many contemporary biographies on the Russian Imperial family.  Last years  Gabriel Constantinovich kept in touch with his Romanov relatives during his long years in exile. He recognized Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia as Head of the Imperial House, and applied to Kirill for a title for his wife, to whom was granted the style of Her Serene Highness, Princess Romanovskaya-Strelninskaya. Gabriel himself was awarded the style of Grand Duke by Kirill's son Vladimir Kirillovich on 15 May 1939. He was the only Romanov prince to be elevated to this style. During the tumultuous years of World War II, Gabriel continued to live in Paris with his wife. The relationship between them never wavered, and they remained devoted to each other. His wife died on 7 March 1950 at the age of 60. Gabriel remarried the following year, on 11 May 1951. His second wife was Princess Irina Ivanovna Kurakina (22 September 1903 ‚Äì 17 January 1993), a 48-year-old exiled Russian princess who was created Her Serene Highness Princess Romanovskaya by Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich. Gabriel died four years later on 28 February 1955 in Paris. He had no children by either marriage and was buried in the Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery.

Larung Gar is the local name for the community of mostly Tibetan and Han Chinese students which grew around the Serta Larung Five Science Buddhist Academy, founded in 1980 by Kyabje Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok. The residents are monks, nuns, vow holders and lay people. Larung Gar was considered the largest Buddhist monastic center until demolitions by the Chinese government recommenced in July 2016. Larung Gar began with less than a dozen students building their residences near Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok's retreat residence, then grew as more Tibetan Buddhist monastic and lay students from the Tibetan plateau arrived. As the Serta Larung Five Science Buddhist Academy grew in reputation and size, more Chinese and international students arrived and built residences to receive teachings from Nyingma Terton Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok. The site is considered sacred and the Academy fulfilled an ancient prophecy by the first Dodrupchen Rinpoche. The community is comprised of residences and retreat meditation huts, built with mud bricks or with wood. As the community grew, nuns built guest houses, and foot paths connected the neighborhoods to the Academy. A few restaurants are located near the main square adjacent to the Gompa. By 1999, reports state Chinese authorities began harassing Larung Gar. An earlier round of demolitions commenced in June 2001,Agissons !

By June 2016, Chinese authorities ordered a cut in the number residents by half to 5000, with no more than 3,500 nuns and 1,500 monks. The forcibly evicted monks and nuns are then forced to attend political re- education programs, while a re-education detainment camp for nuns has also been reported. The director of Free Tibet stated, \\"The demolition at Larung Gar is clearly nothing to do with overcrowding - it is just another tactic in China's attempt to subvert the influence of Buddhism in Tibet.\\" Condemnation of China's demolitions at Larung Gar has been made by the European Parliament in 2016, and concern with the ongoing destruction by the United States Department of State in 2018.

It was officially founded in 1980 in the uninhabited valley by Nyingma lama Khyabje Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok, while it evolved from his mountain retreat previously established there during the Cultural Revolution. That mountain retreat is also said to have connections to a mountain hermitage built in 1880 by Dudjom Dorje. The community grew around Larung Gar's Academy, where monks, nuns, and vow-holding lay people of both Tibetan and Chinese origins study under one of four major spiritual institutions at the Academy: *Ngarig Nangten Lobling - a monastery for approximately 4,000 monks *Pema Khandro Duling Nunnery - a nunnery for approximately 5,000 nuns *Lektso Charbeb Ling - a spiritual center for approximately 1,000 lay vow-holding practitioners *International Religious Committee - a spiritual center for international students  Demolitions and forced evictions  As Larung Gar grew, more than 1,000 new homes were constructed every year by both professional crews and by monks and nuns themselves with the help of their families and friends. By 1986, the resident population of monks and nuns numbered 6,000. And by 1998, 4,500 nuns, 4,000 monks, and nearly 1,000 Chinese students together lived, studied, and meditated at Larung Gar, according to the report from International Campaign for Tibet.

As demolitions continued past June, approximately 4,000 buildings were reported as demolished and 8,000 residents were expelled in 2001, before Chinese authorities returned in 2002 and demolished more buildings, according to the joint 2017 report by Tibet Watch and Free Tibet. An eyewitness visiting Larung Gar at the time stated, \\"Apparently the officials were torturing nuns and monks that were resisting being expelled.

More demolitions occurred in 2013, and in 2015, according to a 2017 Tibet Watch report.Destroying heaven: China's destruction at Larung Gar, (17 December 2017), https://www.tibetwatch.org/larung-gar Between the demolition orders and on 09 January 2014, a vast blaze destroyed around 100 wood houses in Larung Gar, according to the Buddhist Channel, while a state-run media outlet said 10 buildings were destroyed.The Buddhist Channel, 9 January 2014 In June 2016, a mass demolition and forced eviction order at Larung Gar was announced by Chinese authorities, an order to cut the number of Larung Gar residents by half to 5,000, and to offer a reward to ethnic dwellers if they move. On 22 July 2016, the BBC reported evidence from the campaign group Free Tibet that a government work team, accompanied by Chinese police and plainclothes members of the armed forces, had begun to demolish more buildings at Larung Gar in response to an order made the previous month by local authorities. Their objective was the demolition of 1,500 dwellings and the forced eviction of 4,600 residents. The mass demolition drive by the People's Republic of China was a huge violation of human rights of ethnic Tibetans. The authorities also cancelled the annual Larung Gar festival of Tibetans. On 22 July, the Los Angeles Times reported that the demolition was being carried out after \\"two major government meetings during which the Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping stressed 'national unity' and the necessity for religious groups to support the Communist Party and 'merge their religious doctrines with Chinese culture'.\\" Also quoted was Robert Barnett, a Tibet scholar at Columbia University. He said this was indicative of the social unrest in Tibet, \\"We‚Äôve had ‚Äî what is it? ‚Äî five years of self-immolations, massive protests in 2008 and so on. The language of resistance is rife throughout China and Tibet.\\" By November 2016, about 3000 monks and nuns had been forcibly evicted, and around 1000 residences had been destroyed by bulldozers. At least 900 evicted nuns and monks were transported directly to political re- education centers or were detained in a \\"re-education\\" camp. Another 300 evicted nuns and monks were required to report to the prefectures in their hometowns for political re-education. Reports also state the evicted monks and nuns are prohibited from joining their local monasteries and nunneries. On 6 December 2016, the Tibetan government-in-exile's Central Tibetan Administration urged the United Nations to intervene on the issue. On 15 December 2016, the European Parliament adopted an urgency resolution condemning the dismantling of Larung Gar and the forced evictions of the residents, the forced enrollment in \\"patriotic education\\" excercises, and the resulting suicides by evicted nuns. Another demolition order from the Chinese government was publicized on 12 March 2017, for 3,225 residences, according to a 23 March statement from a Larung Gar senior khenpo speaking with Human Rights Watch. The khenpo also stated 4,500 residents had been forced to leave.China: Major Tibetan Buddhist Institution Faces Further Demolitions: Halt ‚ÄòRe-education,‚Äô Humiliation of Monks, Nuns, (29 March 2017), https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/29/china-major-tibetan-buddhist-institution- faces-further-demolitions A report from March 2017 states the dismantling was reported as part of a rebuilding project that the local government was carrying out in order to make the academy fire- and earthquake- safe.Christopher Bodeen. \\"China rebuilding major western Buddhist learning center\\". Columbia Daily Tribune. March 18, 2017. A report in August 2017 found that the demolitions were still being continued, not due to overpopulation ‚Äî the area is expansive ‚Äî but because of a government program to turn the sacred site into a 'tourist attraction'. Thousands of Tibetans had already been displaced, while a Han Chinese migration program to the area continued. The report also found that the Tibetans whose houses were destroyed were forced to sign documents that legally bound them to renounce their land rights in Larung Gar. Afterward, they were sent away via buses without notice on where they will be relocated. Political Re-education The Chinese \\"patriotic re- education\\" programs began at Larung Gar for resident monks and nuns in April 2001. By early November 2016, at least 100 forcibly evicted monks and nuns from Larung Gar were detained in Nyingtri County for political re-education lasting two months or more. Another 300 forcibly evicted monks and nuns were told to report to their respective police departments for political re- education.Political re-education awaits monks and nuns expelled from Larung Gar, (06 November 2016), https://www.tibetanreview.net/political-re-education- awaits-monks-and-nuns-expelled-from-larung-gar/ Another 500 nuns were reported as taken from the region and sent to a patriotic re-education camp, where a video was made while the nuns were forced to chant hymns of loyalty to communism.

The Serta Larung Five Science Buddhist Academy grew from Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok's mountain retreat. The purpose of Larung Gar's Academy is to provide an ecumenical training in Tibetan Buddhism and to meet the need for renewal of meditation, ethics, and scholarship all over Tibet in the wake of China's Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. Despite the remote location, an ancient prophecy by the first Dodrupchen Rinpoche named its founder and described its location, and the site is considered sacred. Larung Gar's Academy grew from less than a dozen students gathering around Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok's home, to a community of more than a hundred students living in mud huts by 1981, as reported by International Campaign for Tibet. Charismatic Tibetan Buddhist leader Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok passes away, (07 January 2004), https://savetibet.org/charismatic-tibetan-buddhist-leader-khenpo-jigme- phuntsok-passes-away/ According to several Tibetan advocacy organizations, the Academy continued growing as monks, nuns, and lay students relocated and built residences, to become one of the largest and most influential ecumenical centers for the study of Tibetan Buddhism in the world. By 2001, the Academy grew to number 8,500 monks and nuns, with an additional 1,000 Chinese students, and more lay persons. By 2016, the number of official residents had grown to 10,000, while the unofficial estimated number was between 20,000 to 40,000 people, according to a joint 2017 report by Tibet Watch and Free Tibet.Destroying Heaven, (19 Octobre 2017), https://www.tibetwatch.org/larung- gar Demographics The Academy's principles of teaching and training are: \\"Unity and Harmony\\"; \\"Pure Precepts\\"; \\"Listening, Reflecting and Meditating\\"; and \\"Spreading the Dharma to Benefit Sentient Beings\\".Larung Gar, http://www.khenposodargye.org/?s=Larung+Gar The student body of Larung Gar Five Science Buddhist Academy is composed of monks, nuns, lay \\"vow-holders\\" and tantric practitioners, of mostly Tibetan and Chinese origins, while Mongolians and students from other Asian countries also figure prominently. Students are associated with one of the four institutions at the Academy: the Ngarig Nangten Lobling monastery, the Pema Khandro Duling Nunnery, the Lektso Charbeb Ling center, and the International Religious Committee. Ngarig Nangten Lobling is the monastery for monks, while approximately 4,000 monks were in residence in 2001. It offers a Khenpo degree, and hundreds of khenpos have graduated from Larung Gar's Academy since 1980. Pema Khandro Duling Nunnery is the nuns center, while approximately 4,500 nuns were in residence in 2001, coming from all regions of Tibet. The majority of residents at the Academy are women, and the curriculum allows nuns to achieve a coveted Khenmo degree for the first time in Tibetan history. Entry into the relatively small number of nunneries that exist in other areas of Tibet has been limited, but the Academy is open to virtually anyone who genuinely seeks to become a student of Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok's ecumenical vision. Khenpo's niece, Jetsunma Mumso, was recognized by the 14th Dalai Lama as a tulku, and heads the nunnery. Lektso Charbeb Ling is the lay practitioner center, and has trained over 1,000 lay \\"vow-holders\\" and tantric practitioners from S√™rtar and other regions of Tibet and China. The International Religious Committee oversees 1,000 students from regions of the People's Republic of China and students from other Asian countries. Roughly ten percent of the nearly 10,000 students attending the Academy are ethnic Han people. They attend separate classes taught in Standard Chinese while larger classes are taught in Amdo Tibetan. The teaching halls are located in the center of the valley, together with a golden statue of the Garuda. History A mountain hermitage was previously established near the location in 1880 by Dudjom Lingpa, and earlier incarnation of Dudjom Rinpoche. Yogis resided there, such as Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok's previous incarnation Terton Lerab Lingpa's student Chatrel Choying Rangdrul, and great realizations were gained in the sacred area. After escaping the Cultural Revolution to reside in the near area with a group of loyal monks, Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok officially took over the mountain hermitage in the summer of 1980 and founded Larung Gar, based on the tradition of Buddhist encampments (chos sgar). Larung Gar's Academy, also known as the Sertar Buddhist Institute, opened and operated privately and independently, with a standing executive committee of seven learned khenpos, or lamas, but major decisions were confirmed and implemented only after consultation with Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok. In 1987, the 10th Panchen Lama bestowed the name of Sertar Larung Ngarig Nangten Lobling, with the ambition to create a \\"spiritual oasis\\" and the largest center for Tibetan Buddhist studies.Agissons !

English, Chinese, and Tibetan languages and modern computer studies have been taught alongside a traditional non-sectarian Buddhist curriculum. The khenpos and khenmos then are authorized to establish Buddhist centers and monasteries, which further propagates Tibetan Buddhism and intertwines with Tibetan culture.Tibetan identity and Tibetan Buddhism in trans-regional connection, (2016), https://journals.openedition.org/emscat/2755 As Terrone also writes, \\"Larung Gar is a landmark of his commitment to disseminate Buddhism in an ecumenical fashion, to strengthen monasticism and Buddhist ethics, and to heighten religious education and Tibetan traditional culture.\\" Demolitions and forced evictions As Larung Gar grew, more than 1,000 new homes were constructed every year by both professional crews and by monks and nuns themselves with the help of their families and friends. In the mid-1980's, the resident population of monks and nuns numbered 6,000. And by 1998, 4,500 nuns, 4,000 monks, and nearly 1,000 Chinese students together lived, studied, and meditated at Larung Gar, according to the report from International Campaign for Tibet. Widely reported and internationally condemned mass demolitions of residences and forced evictions of monks, nuns, and international students impacted the Serta Larung Five Science Buddhist Academy and the community of Larung Gar. Monks and nuns were subject to political re-education programs beginning in April 2000.Tibetan monk convicted in secret trial without due process, (26 March 2010), http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Tibetan-monk- convicted-in-secret-trial,-without-due-process-17994.html The demolitions of monastic residences began in 2001, after pressure was applied from Sertar authorities to Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok and others to denounce the Tibetan spiritual leader, the 14th Dalai Lama. Approximately 8,000 students and residents were evicted as 4,000 buildings were demolished. Afterwards, additional demolitions and forced evictions of monks and nuns also occurred in 2002, and in 2013 when monks and nuns were evicted and some were arrested and sentenced to prison from one to six years, according to a joint Tibet Watch and Free Tibet report. In 2015, another 1,000 people were forcibly evicted including elderly nuns and monks. Mass demolitions recommenced in July 2016 and continued to 2018, to which the European Parliament responded with condemnation in December 2016. The demolition order set a limit to the population of monks and nuns at 5,000 - 3,500 nuns and 1,500 monks - and specified the demolitions of \\"old age homes and nuns' hostels\\". A count of 3,729 people had been evicted by December 2016, and the vast majority of demolitions were of nuns' residences. Additionally, at least 4,820 monks and nuns were forcibly evicted during 2017-2018. China rounds up Tibetan monks and nuns expelled by it at re-education detention centres, (03 July 2019), https://www.tibetanreview.net/china-rounds-up-tibetan-monks-and-nuns-expelled- by-it-at-re-education-detention-centres/ Reports beginning in July 2016 state monks and nuns were bussed to either political re-education centers, or to political re-education camps, or to their home towns and to local political re-education efforts through their prefectures.Political re-education awaits monks and nuns expelled from Larung Gar, (06 November 2016), https://www.tibetanreview.net/political-re-education-awaits-monks-and-nuns- expelled-from-larung-gar/Tibet: l'acculturation passe par la r√©pression des activit√©s religieuses, (06 January 2018), https://www.rfi.fr/fr/emission/20180106-tibet-chine-acculturation-repression- religion-dolma-tsering-teykhangPrefecture sets up detention camp for Tibetan nuns expelled from Larung Gar, (13 December 2016), https://www.tibetanreview.net/prefecture-sets-up-detention-camp-for-tibetan- nuns-expelled-from-larung-gar/ As at Yarchen Gar, whose demolitions and forced evictions are similar to those at Larung Gar, evicted nuns and monks are not permitted to re-enroll at their home monasteries, or to relocate. The demolitions also impacted the open organization of the original encampment, and its atmosphere of quiet spiritual contemplation and study. Some of the demolitions in Larung Gar widened footpaths into roadways, which introduced vehicles into semi-private areas previously closed to traffic, as described by a joint Tibet Watch and Free Tibet report. The mix of students in residential areas was changed to separate the students into areas designated for nuns, for monks and for lay students surrounded by walls. The report also indicates other demolitions were undertaken adjacent to the main Gompa, where a hotel was being constructed by 2017. Reports do not indicate that the Academy's buildings were subject to physical demolitions, which include the monastery, the nunnery, the lay practitioner's center, and the foreign student center. But in August 2017, it was announced that a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) committee of six was taking over control of Larung Gar's Academy, a move observers said was for greater control and surveillance. The deputy police chief of Garze would be appointed as the Institute's CCP secretary and as its director, a move which would remove Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok's niece, recognized tulku Ani Mumsto from the position. Tibetan author Tsering Woeser stated, \\"Sending party secretaries to run a Tibetan Buddhist institute is just ridiculous,\\" and, \\"The party does not regard Larung Gar as a Buddhist academy, but attempts to manage it as a unit of the state or party apparatus.\\"In Tibetan Buddhist heartland, Communist party takeover threatens..., (25 August 2017), http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2108308/tibetan- buddhist-heartland-communist-party-takeover-threatens  Horxi Samyang Lonp√™ Buddhist Institute  The Larung Horxi Samyang Lonp√™ Buddhist Institute (, ) is a Buddhist institute 20 kilometers from the Serta Larung Five Science Buddhist Academy at Larung Gar, 40 kilometers from the central town of S√™rtar County. While not located in the Larung Valley, it was named by C√ºchim Lozh√∂ (), K√§nbo of the Ngarig Buddhist Academy. Tourism and media Larung Gar and the Larung Valley are outside the main tourist routes and few foreigners find their way there. Larung Gar has been closed to foreign visitors since June 2016. There is one hotel on the Northern ridgeline, which is most easily reached via the new construction access road from the north, avoiding the congestion on the narrow streets of the institute. There are also a simple guesthouse and a few restaurants on the main square next to the main Gompa. A new \\"Temple of Death\\" has been built at the sky burial site about one kilometer north of the institute. In February 2016, a photograph of Larung Gar by Hungarian photographer Attila Balogh was shortlisted for that year's Sony World Photography Awards.

Early years  Prefontaine was born to a French Canadian father and a Vietnamese mother at the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in California. His father was born and raised in Verdun, Quebec and Noel lived with his grandmother in Verdun as a child, which enables him to be considered a non-import for CFL purposes. He returned to the United States and attended El Camino High School in San Diego County, California. Prefontaine played baseball, soccer, and played offensive tackle in American football as a child and continually trained himself to improve as an athlete and at high school, he played quarterback as well as punting and placekicking. He was named San Diego Tribune Athlete of the Year for North County as a senior and led El Camino High School to a 22‚Äì2 record and a CIF Championship as their starting quarterback. Prefontaine hoped to play quarterback in college football but could only obtain a scholarship as a punter at California State University, Fullerton. His punting average his first year led the state but the football program folded at the end of the season. Prefontaine received offers to play for multiple college football teams including Michigan, Michigan State, Georgia, LSU, and Texas but chose to go to Arizona State University because it was close to his family and friends. He was unhappy there, however, and left to go to San Diego State University. After a required redshirt year because of his transfer, he was named All- Conference as a punter in his junior year and first-team All-American as a punter in his senior year. Professional career =XFL= In 2001, Prefontaine also played in the XFL with the Los Angeles Xtreme as their punter. He was officially listed as the team's third-string quarterback (behind Tommy Maddox and Scott Milanovich, the latter of whom would eventually become Prefontaine's coach in Toronto) in order to collect a higher salary and because the XFL did not reserve separate roster spots for punters (on the other XFL teams, placekickers doubled as punters). He went on to play in the one and only XFL championship game on April 21, 2001 with the Xtreme, with his team ultimately winning the championship. =CFL= Prefontaine began his CFL career in 1998 with the Toronto Argonauts and spent the next ten seasons with them before getting traded to the Edmonton Eskimos on May 31, 2008 for a first round pick in the 2009 CFL Draft and a conditional draft pick in 2010. On October 12, 2010, Prefontaine was traded back to the Argonauts in exchange for defensive tackle √âtienne L√©gar√© and the negotiation rights to defensive back Damaso Munoz. On February 12, 2014, Prefontaine was released by the Argonauts. In his CFL career Prefontaine won the Grey Cup twice, both with the Argonauts, in 2004 and 2012. On August 14, 2014 Prefontaine announced that he will sign a 1-day contract with the Toronto Argonauts on August 17, with the purpose of retiring as an Argonaut.

In the early 1980s, the station changed frequencies to 105.7 MHz - a frequency located within the current commercial portion of the FM band.

Knowing the dealer's hand provides significant information to the player. To maintain the house edge, the payout when the player receives a natural blackjack is reduced to even money from 3:2, and players lose their bets when their hand is tied with the dealer. In addition, with both dealers' cards exposed at the outset, players cannot buy insurance or surrender their hand. Other rules changes also exist to the detriment of players. Certain tables restrict doubling down and splitting, and do not allow doubles after splits. The game was proposed by Richard A. Epstein in 1977, and first appeared at Vegas World in 1979 with rule changes that favored the house. The basic strategy for this game is different, both because the player can see dealer cards 11 to 20 and because the player loses all ties except blackjacks. For examples, two ten-value cards are split whenever the dealer has 13 through 16, and a hard 19 must be hit if the dealer has a 20.

The group toured heavily, often supporting or touring alongside bands such as Motion City Soundtrack and the All-American Rejects. Their third album, Let Me Come Home saw release in 2005, and the band issued their final, self-titled release in 2007.

Founded in 1851 as the Oregon Statesman, it later merged with the Capital Journal to form the current newspaper, the second-oldest in Oregon. The Statesman Journal is distributed in Salem, Keizer, and portions of the mid-Willamette Valley. The average weekday circulation is 27,859, with Sunday's readership listed at 36,323. It is owned, along with the neighboring Stayton Mail and Silverton Appeal Tribune, by the national Gannett Company. History =Oregon Statesman= The Oregon Statesman was founded on March 28, 1851, by Asahel Bush, a Democrat, in response to the Whig-controlled Portland-based paper, The Oregonian. Congressional delegate Samuel Thurston assisted Bush in starting the newspaper while Thurston was in Washington, D.C.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 186. Printed using a hand press, the paper was originally based in Oregon City, but moved to Salem in June 1853 when the Oregon State Capitol was relocated to that city. The paper was used as a mouthpiece of the Democratic Party and of the Salem Clique that ran the party in Salem. Bush and editor Thomas J. Dryer of the Oregonian are known as for setting a standard of heavily partisan coverage among early Oregon newspapers. In March 1863, Bush sold the paper and entered the banking field. The name of the paper was changed to the Salem Statesman and became less of a partisan newspaper. In 1866, the Statesman ceased publication, only to resume in 1869 under the guidance of editor Samuel Asahel Clarke and under the new moniker of The Statesman and Unionist. The Unionist portion was removed from the name within a short amount of time. For 18 months in 1883-84, 50% of the newspaper was owned by William H. Byars, the former publisher of the Roseburg Plaindealer (1873-83) who was nominated as State Printer in late 1882 and elected in 1883. In 1884 R. J. Hendricks became the paper's manager and editor, positions he held for 44 years, and ownership passed to Jasper Wilkins and Alonzo Gesner, with Gesner selling out his part within a year.Daily Oregon Statesman, March 7, 1912, 1:6 & 4:5. =Capital Journal= Will H. Parry established the Capital Journal on March 1, 1888, initially as a for-profit venture and an outlet for the Republican Party. By the end of the year, Parry sold the Journal to William H. Byars (who also was elected that year as Salem's City Surveyor), one of many ownership changes in subsequent years. (In 1890, Byars was appointed by Pres. Benjamin Harrison as U.S. Surveyor General for Oregon.) Around 1918, George Putnam purchased the Capital Journal and served as editor for 30 years before selling to Bernard Mainwaring in 1953. Meanwhile, Charles A. Sprague, who went on to become governor of Oregon, bought the Statesman in 1929. In 1954, Mainwaring and Sprague agreed that their respective papers should cooperate closely. The Journal moved into the Statesman's new facility and the two papers began sharing printing facilities while keeping independent writers and editors. =1973 sale and merger= In 1973, both papers were sold to national publisher Gannett, the company that publishes USA Today. In 1980, they were combined to form the Statesman Journal. Dating to the Statesman's inception, it is the second-oldest Oregon newspaper. The paper won ten first- place awards in the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association's annual Better Newspaper Contest in 2001, the most in its division. In the 2006 contest, the paper took first place in its division for overall excellence, best editorial page, and best editorial. Details The newspaper primarily covers news in the Salem-Keizer metropolitan area in the middle section of the Willamette Valley. Coverage includes state politics, Salem area news, area sports, business news, and lifestyle news. Circulation is focused on Marion and Polk counties with a market size of 410,000 residents, with some additional circulation in neighboring Linn, Lincoln, Yamhill, and Benton counties. In 2008 The Statesman Journal had circulation of 46,826 from Monday through Saturday, and 53,367 Sunday. By 2018, the average daily circulation had declined to 27,859 Monday-Tuesday, Thursday and 33,815 Wednesday, with a Sunday readership of 36,323. The newspaper also publishes The Stayton Mail of Stayton and the Appeal Tribune of Silverton.

The title is a reference to the trio's acronym \\"DAAS\\" and Karl Marx's economic treatise Das Kapital. The series premiered on 15 July 1991, in Australia on the ABC network, and the season finale aired 7 July 1992. DAAS Kapital aired in 18 countries including Japan, Britain, USA and Germany and was released on DVD 20 March 2013 with commentary by the All Stars and a new, original song. On 13 April 2013, the All Stars reunited for a one- off show celebrating the launch of the DVD set.All Star secrets revealed - Doug Anthonys share anecdotes, Chortle.co.uk, 13 April 2013. Format DAAS Kapital was a sitcom that incorporated sketch show and variety show TV formats. For example, in each scripted episode, there would be cutaways to television shows and commercials‚Äîtypically Shitsu Tonka News, Troy The Invincible and Wayne Kerr‚Äîalong with guest appearances by Paul Livingston, Bob, Bob Downe and stop-motion animation sequences, along with original songs performed by the Doug Anthony All Stars. Ferguson described the show as \\"a cross between Land of Giants, Marine Boy and Jacques Cousteau on speed.\\" Each episode's plot usually consisted of a very simple idea, such as a bug infestation on board or a Cinderella-style story mixed with all the above segments strung together with very quick jokes, narrative humour and stories told by the All Stars. Characters and casting In addition to Tim, Paul and Richard, numerous other recurring characters appeared throughout the series. These included: * Flacco (Paul Livingston): a strange alien being with a high- pitched voice. He spends most of his time talking to his pet (animated) cockroach, Ross. Livingston also portrays several other characters throughout the series, such as the Marquis de Sade and the Pope, although the other characters have Flacco's mannerisms. * Psycho Bob (Michael Petroni): an American serial killer and psychotic who has somehow stowed away on board. He usually has a ranting monologue to camera ending with his catchphrase: \\"I'm Bob, and I'll be back.\\" Tim is the only member of the crew to have seen or encountered him, implying that he is a figment of Tim's subconscious. * Thulgore (animated): a giant monster (said to be a crab louse, but with anthropomorphic face and limbs) who lives in the engine room. * The Shitsu Tonka newsreader (Khym Lam): the boys' only contact with the outside world is broadcasts from Shitsu Tonka's television network, including regular bulletins from a female Asian newsreader. * Bob Downe (Mark Trevorrow): a cheesy cabaret singer who is a TV personality on Shitsu Tonka. * Wayne Kerr (Tim Ferguson): along with his sidekick pals, Spinner (Richard Fidler) and Paddlefoot (Paul McDermott), are characters in the most violent program on Shitsu Tonka (\\"with a G-5 violence rating!\\"). * Troy the Invincible (Paul McDermott): appears on Shitsu Tonka. Performs acts of violence on himself to demonstrate the invincibility of his working-class principles. * Uncle Biff Happy (Richard Fidler): a used car salesman whose ads appear on Shitsu Tonka. Scenario By the year 1998, the Shitsu Tonka Unitocracy has taken over the world. \\"Competition between nations has been made redundant by the universal 'Common Cents' currency and rezoning and decentralisation of much of the world's population. By homogenising the various races of the world, the petty nationalism that has plagued civilisation since the Dawn of Man has been diffused ... all [minorities] are allowed to flourish in the macrosociety we have imposed.\\" The show itself takes place in the year 2006 as the All Stars (Tim Ferguson, Paul McDermott and Richard Fidler) are placed in a submarine with all the world's artwork and treasures and their \\"assignment is to catalogue history.\\" Some time later they become lost, their whereabouts unknown and their existence is denied by the Shitsu Tonka Corp. In the final episode of season 1, it becomes apparent that Shitsu Tonka deliberately sabotaged the ship, placing Richard on board as a robot implanted with a bomb. He was to self-destruct and completely destroy history. Instead, the blast propelled the submarine into space, providing an opportunity for more sci-fi based storylines and parodies in the show's second season. In the final episode of this season, the ship returns to the ocean.  Episodes  = Season 1 (1991) = All episodes are named after the seven deadly sins. The episodes listed in the Season 1 scriptbook are in this order: Avarice, Sloth, Gluttony, Pride, Envy, Lust, Anger. Episodes in broadcast order below. * \\"Gluttony\\" opens with the All Stars performing a cover of The Velvet Underground's \\"Sunday Morning.\\" On the 2013 DAAS Kapital DVD, the song is omitted due to \\"contractual reasons... and because we never paid to use it in the first place,\\" according to Paul McDermott. In its place is the song \\"Saturday (mourning),\\" also known as Saturday's The Day For Leaving,\\" written and recorded exclusively for the DVD release. During the song, the DVD displays text to this effect, before mentioning the All Stars' performance of Sunday Morning \\"is still on YouTube\\". = Season 2 (1992) = All episodes are named after the seven heavenly virtues.  DVD  DAAS reunited for a one-off show to launch the DVD release of DAAS Kapital, 13 April 2013 On 1 November 2012, Tim Ferguson announced via Twitter that a DAAS Kapital DVD was underway and would be released in 2013. Ferguson then tweeted that the set would include audio commentary followed by a picture of the recording session, one of the DAAS Kapital crew as they are today and revealing that a new, original song was being recorded for the DVD set. The DVD was confirmed for release on 20 March 2013, with the group reforming for the official launch of the DVD set on 13 April. After lengthy discussion on the DVD set itself, the show and guests Flacco, Khym Lam and producer/co-director Ted Robinson, DAAS performed three songs: \\"My Girl\\" (the first song they performed together as a group), \\"Warsong\\" from DAAS Kapital and the last song the group recorded, the DVD exclusive \\"Saturday's The Day For Leaving.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:1991 Australian television series debuts Category:1992 Australian television series endings Category:Australian Broadcasting Corporation original programming Category:Australian comedy television series Category:Television series set in 2006 Category:Television series set in the future Category:Seven deadly sins in popular culture ","title":"DAAS Kapital"},{"id":"2526066","text":"Jaroslav (also written as Yaroslav or Jaros≈Çaw) is a Slavic first name pagan in origin.

It is considered miraculous because the Giants were ahead 17-12 and could easily have run out the final seconds; they had the ball and the Eagles had no timeouts left. Joe Pisarcik botched an attempt to hand off the football to fullback Larry Csonka. Edwards picked up the dropped ball and ran 26 yards for the winning score. The term is primarily used by Eagles fans and sportscasters. Giants fans refer to the play simply as \\"The Fumble\\", though that name is generally used outside of New York for a play in the 1987 AFC Championship Game between the Cleveland Browns and Denver Broncos. For the Eagles, the victory snatched from the jaws of certain defeat served as a morale boost, leading that season to a playoff berth and, two seasons later, the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance. To Giants fans, it was the nadir of a long era of mediocrity, but the aftermath would lead to major changes that proved beneficial for the franchise in the long run. Background It was the first meeting between the divisional rivals that season. The Eagles were in third place in the NFC East, behind the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins; the Giants were in fourth. The teams went into the game in similar situations, but heading in different directions. They had playoff hopes, especially since this was the first 16-game NFL season, but likely would have to settle for a wild card berth due to the solid lead the powerful Dallas Cowboys had in the division. Given the similarity of their records, it was likely the outcome would have playoff implications, since the first tie-breaker for a wild card spot is the head-to-head record. =Giants= Going into the game, the Giants were 5‚Äì6. A three-game losing streak on the road had made the team's playoff prospects much dimmer since midseason. However, a win at home against the favored Eagles could, the team hoped, reverse the trend and keep an outside shot at a playoff spot alive. Despite the team's storied past, the Giants had not played in the postseason since 1963 and had managed only two winning seasons since then. Although they were the league's fourth oldest franchise, they were almost a non-entity in the post-merger NFL. The move to New Jersey in 1976 had alienated some longtime fans, even if it made more seats available. Fans had never gone this long without a contender, but while they were growing restless, they were still forgiving. However, there was little pressure they could bring to bear on the people who could ultimately make changes, longtime team owners Wellington Mara and his nephew Tim, who inherited his father Jack's stake in the team after Jack Mara died in 1965. The two managed team operations closely, but feuded so bitterly with each other that at one point a partition had to be erected between their seats in the owners' box. The effects of this uncertainty and instability at the highest managerial level affected the team's play, most significantly when it came to some apparently inexplicable personnel decisions. It was not lost on fans that players (Craig Morton and Fran Tarkenton) and coaches (Tom Landry and Vince Lombardi) who had once been in the Giants' fold were now enjoying or had enjoyed great success elsewhere. The team also had passed over future stars for less able players in the annual draft. But all this was for naught. With far more demand for tickets than there were available, the team was financially healthy no matter how poorly it performed on the field, and the Maras were widely viewed as complacent by observers who didn't know the depth of the ownership schism. Friction between offensive players and assistant coaches The week before the game, players, particularly on offense, had complained to reporters about the team's assistant coaches. Head coach John McVay was popular with them. He had taken over the team in the middle of the 1976 season after Bill Arnsparger was fired and improved morale while adding talented players to the team. However, the players were not so enthusiastic about many of the longtime friends he had hired as assistants. The players felt the assistant coaches were uninterested in helping younger players develop, at least compared to their counterparts on other teams. As an example, they pointed out that the season before, none of the team's three quarterbacks had had any previous NFL experience, yet no quarterback coach had been hired. They also noted that one of the few coaches who seemed to care, Jerry Wampfler, coached the offensive line, one of the Giants' most improved units that season. Offensive coordinator Bob Gibson was the most frequent target of complaints. He had taken to the relatively nascent practice (now quite common) of calling all the plays from the upstairs press box. Pisarcik had often challenged Gibson about this, sometimes openly, over the past two seasons. The players felt that Gibson should let Pisarcik call plays. They pointed out that during the previous week's loss to Washington, the team had attempted only three passes on several third-and-long situations during the game. They also felt insulted that on a third-and-7 in overtime, the coaches had called a run play. Gibson for his part had limited confidence in Pisarcik's passing ability, an opinion widely shared (the media in New York referred to him as \\"off-Broadway Joe\\", a sarcastic reference to former New York Jets' quarterback, \\"Broadway Joe\\" Namath). He and other coaches pointed out that the three passing attempts the players pointed to had resulted in two interceptions and a sack. The team's general philosophy at the time was to concentrate on its improving defense and play conservatively on offense until it could be made more competitive. Players on the Giants' offense became frustrated over this decision and wanted more chances to prove themselves. =Eagles= At 6‚Äì5, things looked a little more promising for the visitors. The two-game win streak they took into the game had gotten them over a .500 first half. Momentum clearly was on their side, and the Giants had not beaten the Eagles since the opening game of the 1975 season, three years prior. Still, the Giants were a decent team, and the Eagles knew they could not relax. They, too, were an old-line NFL franchise coming off many years in the doldrums. They had not been to the playoffs since winning their third NFL title in 1960, and had only notched two winning seasons in the 17 years since then. However, their fans were less inclined to be forgiving than Giants' fans. A loss to the slumping Giants would have dealt a severe blow to the confidence the team needed to maintain over the last quarter of its schedule, in which it would face not only the Cowboys, but the equally formidable Minnesota Vikings as well as the Giants again in Philadelphia. 1978 was also viewed as an important season for head coach Dick Vermeil, as there was little doubt the Eagles were playing much better under his watch, but there was also a great deal of local impatience for concrete results. The game The Giants opened a two touchdown lead in the first quarter on two Pisarcik touchdown passes, and did not give up the lead until the final play of the game. The Eagles, conversely, struggled, missing one of their extra point attempts and botching the snap on the other. The Eagles found themselves down 17‚Äì12, meaning they could only win the game with a touchdown as time wound down. Deep in their own territory, the Giants' Doug Kotar fumbled late in the fourth quarter, raising hopes (or fears) of a comeback by the visitors. Those were quickly put to rest, however, when rookie defensive back Odis McKinney's first NFL interception gave the Giants possession of the football after the two- minute warning. The Eagles had exhausted all their timeouts by this point. Fans in the stands began heading for the exits as the game seemed all but over, with no apparent remaining danger of an Eagles comeback. Nowadays, teams in this situation let the play clock run down to the last possible second and have the quarterback take a knee. On the sidelines, a disgusted Eagles coach Dick Vermeil was turning his attention away from the field and toward the postgame press conference, where he would have to explain to reporters why his team had fallen to an inferior opponent. =The Giants' possession= Since the rule to allow QBs to simply kneel did not take effect until 1987, Pisarcik took the snap on first down and rolled on the ground (a common play for QBs in the pre-kneel era). Eagles middle linebacker Bill Bergey charged into Giants' center Jim Clack, knocking him backward into Pisarcik in a desperate attempt to force a fumble. Since defensive players usually are not blocked in this situation, they usually in turn do not rush. Offensive players consider any breach of this tacit agreement as a provocation, particularly linemen whose job it is to protect the quarterback, and fights between angry linemen and the opposition were not uncommon. Gibson did not want to expose his quarterback to further risk of injury, nor did he want to risk his players being fined for violating the league's rules against fighting. Most importantly, the last thing he wanted was for his team to get a penalty, which could stop the clock and require getting another first down to secure the win. He also personally despised the kneeling play, considering it unsporting and somewhat dishonorable (a view popular among a lot of coaches of the period). Also given that the play clock at the time was only 30 seconds (as it would remain through the 1987 season), a play had to be run. So on second down he called \\"65 Power-Up\\", a standard play which called for Csonka to take a handoff and run up the middle. Csonka took the ball and ran for 11 yards. For the third play in the Giants' series, the same play was called again. In the huddle, the Giants were incredulous when the call came in. \\"Don't give me the ball,\\" begged Csonka, the former Dolphins star. Other players asked Pisarcik to change the play, but he demurred. Gibson had berated him for changing a play the week before and threatened to have him waived if he ever did so again. Gibson did not take the time to explain his decision to Pisarcik. As a result, the rest of the offense simply viewed Gibson's call as a power trip. Because he was a second-year starting quarterback who still had not totally proven himself, in the era before free agency, Pisarcik lacked the stature to prevail in this kind of dispute. Csonka claims that, as he walked away from the huddle, he told Pisarcik he would not take the ball if he went through with it. It is not known whether the quarterback heard him or not, however. McVay's headphones, which normally allowed him to communicate with Pisarcik and Gibson, were not working properly at that point either. McVay has since stated that he would certainly have overruled Gibson had he heard what was coming. Across the line of scrimmage, the Eagles had not huddled, as defensive coordinator Marion Campbell called for an all-out 11-man blitz. Edwards, who as a defensive back normally would have been several yards deep, was instead close enough to Kotar to talk to him (the Giants player assured him that his team was just going to kneel again). Vermeil later said the blitz made the victory possible. The Giants wasted several seconds in the huddle in dismay over the play-calling. At the line, Clack saw the play clock winding down and took it upon himself to snap it with 31 seconds left in the game to avoid a delay-of-game penalty, which would have stopped the clock and cost the Giants five yards. Had the Giants knelt on the subsequent play, there still would have been one second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40). Pisarcik, who at the time was distracted making sure Csonka was in position, was unprepared for the snap. It struck his middle finger so hard there was still blood on the nail after the game. Nevertheless, he held on to the ball after a slight bobble and tried to hand it off to Csonka. Instead, the ball hit Csonka's hip and came loose. Edwards recovered it on its first bounce as Pisarcik unsuccessfully attempted to fall on it. Kotar, who could have blocked him or fallen on the ball himself, never even saw the fumble, according to Edwards. Once Edwards got it, he sprinted 26 yards untouched into the end zone for a 19‚Äì17 Eagles victory. There was stunned silence from the stands and the Giants' sideline. The only noise came from the celebrating Eagles. =The call= With Giants victory all but assured, CBS commentator Don Criqui (working alongside Sonny Jurgensen) had begun to read the end credits for the game's control truck and on-field personnel shortly before the game's final play: After the game, while showing league highlights, CBS replayed the play. They showed the reaction of both coaches, while Brent Musburger famously narrated, \\"A study in contrast!\\" According to RJ Bell of Pregame, the point spread of Philadelphia Eagles ‚àí2 turned Giants winning bets into pushes. The immediate aftermath For Edwards, the play was a personal redemption, as he had been burned on one of Pisarcik's early touchdown passes and would have been partially to blame for the loss. It also was his first NFL touchdown. Vermeil refused to question McVay's judgment but allowed that he, too, disliked sitting on the ball to preserve a victory. Giants fans were enraged. For a football team to lose in that situation was unprecedented. Pisarcik, who belatedly explained to the press, \\"I never had control,\\" needed a police escort to get to his car. During an NFL Network show about famous on-field bloopers, Csonka said that he immediately had Pisarcik join him on a chartered plane trip to South Florida, where they hung out and fished for a few days before returning to New York. Gibson was fired the next morning. With angry fans already demanding that someone be held responsible for the debacle, team officials felt he had to go in hopes of saving the season. So great was the stigma of having called the play that he never worked in football at any level again. After his firing, Gibson moved to Florida where he subsequently became manager of a local bait shop. He never spoke about the play again for the rest of his life.ESPN NFL Live, November 19, 2008, 4:00pm EST, second segment. Gibson was reached by telephone by ESPN and gave the following statement: \\"I haven't talked about the game for thirty years, and I'm not about to start now.\\" In 2008, in a telephone call from ESPN and 30 years after the game, Gibson said: \\"I haven't talked about the game for 30 years, and I'm not about to start now.\\" Gibson died in 2015 at the age of 88. =Giants fan reaction= Fans turned on management and ownership as previously grumbled complaints about the team's ineptitude turned into an incessant roar. Their team was now the laughingstock of the league. The Fumble (a term in use before the end of the week) epitomized all the mismanagement and all the talent the team had let get away. At a demonstration outside the stadium prior to the next home game against the Los Angeles Rams, many fans threw their tickets into a bonfire. A Newark furniture dealer named Morris Spielberg organized a Giants' Fans Committee after running an ad in the Newark Star-Ledger that drew hundreds of responses. They met at a hotel near the stadium prior to the team's final home game on December 10 against the St. Louis Cardinals and distributed flyers to pass out to fellow fans during the game. Spielberg had arranged for a plane to fly over the stadium with a banner reading \\"15 Years of Lousy Football ‚Äî We've Had Enough.\\" When it came, fans were to chant, \\"We've had enough.\\" The Giants posted a 17‚Äì0 shutout win, but when the plane came (an hour behind schedule), fans showed the victory was not enough to make them forget their recent humiliation. There were more than 24,000 empty seats, yet crowd applause and chants briefly stopped play. The rest of the season The surprise finish accelerated the directions both teams were taking over the season's final four games. They met in Veterans Stadium in the final regular season game. =Eagles= Philadelphia was able to extend its win streak to four games the next week, before losing to Dallas and Minnesota. The Eagles managed a season sweep of the Giants with an easy 20‚Äì3 victory in the finale to finish 9‚Äì7 and snare the second of two wild-card spots available under the playoff format at that time. \\"One play gets you feeling like you have confidence\\", Edwards explained years later. \\"You're not worried about losing anymore; now you're thinking about how you can win.\\" The Eagles lost the playoff game to the Atlanta Falcons because of another failed extra point, in addition to a missed field goal as time expired. But it gave them and their fans something to build on for the next season. Philadelphia corrected its kicking woes by drafting barefoot Tony Franklin from Texas A&M; in 1979. As a rookie, Franklin booted a 59-yard field goal on Monday Night Football against the Dallas Cowboys during a 31‚Äì21 victory at Texas Stadium. =Giants= At first, the Giants tried to look ahead and recover. They vowed to win their remaining four games and protect McVay's job. Instead, the collapse continued. The next week, the Giants blew a 10-point lead over the 3‚Äì9 Buffalo Bills late in the game, giving up 27 points in the fourth quarter to lose 41‚Äì17. They would win only one more game the rest of the season, finishing with a 6‚Äì10 record. The sweep by Philadelphia ensured the Giants would finish last in the division (tied with the Cardinals) for the third straight season, extending their rut and further angering fans. After the season =Eagles= The next year, the Eagles again earned a wild-card spot and then won their first post-merger playoff game over the Chicago Bears before falling to Tampa Bay. Following that season, the Giants traded Pisarcik to them for a draft choice. He would finish his career as a backup to Ron Jaworski five years later. His entire NFL career is usually embodied in that play, and while he is sometimes reluctant to talk about it, he admits that at least people remember his name thanks to it. The Eagles' momentum carried them further in the 1980‚Äì81 season, to the division championship, then the conference title and finally to Super Bowl XV, which they lost 27‚Äì10 to the Oakland Raiders at the Superdome in New Orleans. \\"We won the game at the end, and we went on to the playoffs\\", Edwards said. \\"The next thing, we're playing in the Super Bowl.\\" He, too, would find that the play defined his career, even though he remained part of the Eagles' lineup for another seven years before going into coaching after a final season split between the Falcons and Rams. =Giants= McVay's contract expired and, as expected, was not renewed. He said in 2008 that had the Giants won, the team likely would have won two more games, his contract would have been renewed, \\"and now I'd be dead with a heart attack.\\" McVay never coached again, but went on to a front-office job with the San Francisco 49ers, where he helped develop that team into one of the most dominant of the 1980s. Andy Robustelli, a former All-Pro defensive end who served as the team's director of operations, was also let go. Csonka's contract was up as well. Since McVay, with whom he had played in the World Football League's Memphis Southmen before signing with the Giants, was gone and his career was ending, he decided to return to Miami, site of his past glories, for one final season. He would win an NFL Comeback Player of the Year award before retiring. Despite widespread calls to hire Joe Paterno or another successful college coach, the Giants settled on Ray Perkins, then an assistant for the San Diego Chargers, to replace McVay. While Perkins was able to follow the Eagles' lead and build a team that eventually made the playoffs in 1981, the moves that really made a difference for the Giants drew less attention that off-season. Wellington Mara had been running football operations himself since joining the organization in the late 1930s, long after most teams had hired a general manager. He continued to do so even after inheriting the team upon the death of his father, Tim, in 1958. While he had delegated some of his authority to Robustelli in 1974, he still had the final say in football matters. However, the fan revolt that erupted in the wake of the Fumble made the Maras realize that they needed to delegate most of the decisions that sorely divided them. As with many other team matters, they kept arguing over whom to hire as general manager. In the off-season, they called on NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle to mediate. He suggested George Young, then an executive with the Miami Dolphins, who only took the job after he was granted complete control of the football side of the operation. He proved to be a superb judge of talent, drafting Phil Simms, Lawrence Taylor and other future Giants stars over the next few seasons. In 1981, Perkins hired a new defensive coordinator, Bill Parcells, a New England Patriots assistant who was out of coaching in 1979 after serving as head coach at Air Force in 1978. When Perkins resigned after the 1982 season to succeed the late Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama, Parcells took over as head coach. He survived a disastrous first season to lead the talent Young had acquired to two Super Bowl championships. Legacy The Miracle at the Meadowlands has left a lasting impact on the way organized football is played at all levels, not just in the NFL. Most notably, it legitimized the quarterback kneel. Coaches everywhere took heed of Gibson's fate and immediately began instructing quarterbacks to sit on the ball in similar situations. Some traditionalists feel that the kneel-down has been detrimental to the game and have called for rule changes to eliminate or discourage the play. Other leagues, such as the Arena Football League, have done just that, and now require the ball to be advanced past the line of scrimmage in order for the clock to continue running in the final minute of play. Formation used ever since the Fumble/Miracle for quarterback kneel play. =Formation change= The week after the game, both the Giants and Eagles implemented a new offensive formation to be used only in end-of-game kneeldowns. It is popularly known as the \\"Victory Formation\\" or \\"Victory Offense\\". Not only did the infamous game-losing play make kneeling acceptable, but most of the teams using it changed how it was done. Prior to Pisarcik's fumble, teams had employed standard offensive formations such as an I or a split backfield. The Eagles' unlikely touchdown, however, had made the weakness of doing so glaring. Even though Pisarcik had been trying to hand off instead of kneeling, when he fumbled the snap, there was not only no offensive player there to try to recover it, no one was in position to tackle Edwards and prevent the touchdown either. At the end of the first half of the Bills game the following week, the Giants debuted the new formation when Pisarcik knelt to preserve their lead. Two running backs stood closely behind Pisarcik while a third (usually a speedy player such as a wide receiver) was stationed as a sort of safety several yards back. The Eagles, too, had practiced a similar formation in practice, calling it the Herman Edwards play. Other NFL teams soon followed the lead, and today the formation is standard in college and high school games as well. =Similar plays= The play has been recalled often by fans and reporters in later years when a team fumbled away a sure victory late in the game, although it never happened quite as spectacularly as it did that first time. Probably the most famous play to evoke the Miracle of the Meadowlands, although with a very different outcome, occurred almost three decades later in a 2006 Steelers-Colts AFC divisional playoff game. As in 1978, an Indianapolis turnover on downs had given Pittsburgh the ball on the Indianapolis 2-yard line and an apparent three-point victory over the heavily favored Colts in the game's final two minutes. However, the Steelers had to keep running the ball, as the Colts still had all their timeouts left. A field goal would have at least required the Colts to score a touchdown (plus kick the extra point) to win the game, while a touchdown would essentially clinch victory, so it was in the Steelers' interest to keep running. A pass would run the risk of being intercepted, or seeing the defense knock the ball out of the quarterback's hand. But on the very first play, running back Jerome Bettis, who had not fumbled all season, had the ball knocked loose by Indianapolis middle linebacker Gary Brackett. Defensive back Nick Harper recovered the ball and appeared to be on the way to an Edwards-like touchdown, but Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger managed to tackle Harper near midfield. Steelers fans and players feared that Bettis was about to end his career with the same ignominy that followed Pisarcik. Several plays later, however, Colts kicker Mike Vanderjagt wound up the game's goat, evoking another memorable football moment when he missed what would have been the tying field goal, ending what had been a strong season for his team. The Steelers eventually went on to a Super Bowl victory that year, and the play would instead enter NFL lore as \\"The Tackle II\\". The play most directly analogous to the Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On Thanksgiving Day 1993, the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in sleet. As the clock ticked down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, waiting for it to come to rest in order to down it as close as possible to the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end Leon Lett sprinted downfield to try to recover it. He slipped on the slick surface and touched the ball. His touch meant that it became a live ball and Miami was able to recover at the Dallas 1 and kick a field goal for a 16‚Äì14 victory. Lett earned comparisons to Pisarcik and the 1978 Giants since his action was as unnecessary and seemed equally inexplicable. It was fourth down and the ball would have been turned over to Dallas anyway. Coming on the heels of the previous year's Super Bowl, when a prematurely celebrating Lett had been stripped on a fourth-quarter fumble return as he was about to score a touchdown, the Thanksgiving gaffe cemented his reputation for unthinking play that overshadowed his entire career. A near-identical play in a 1999 collegiate game allowed the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) to steal a victory from Baylor. With the final seconds ticking off the clock, Baylor had a 24‚Äì21 lead and possession of the football near the UNLV goal line. With UNLV out of timeouts, only a kneeldown was necessary. However, instead of trying to run out the clock, Baylor elected to try for a touchdown in an attempt to run up the final score. Baylor running back Darryl Bush fumbled while trying to punch his way into the end zone, and UNLV's Kevin Thomas picked up the loose football and went 99 yards for the game-winning touchdown on the last play of the game. \\"The Miracle on the Mountain\\" is another play with similar circumstances. It took place on October 12, 2002 in a game between the home Appalachian State Mountaineers and visiting Furman Paladins at Kidd Brewer Stadium. A low scoring affair, the Paladins elected to attempt a two-point conversion after scoring the go-ahead touchdown with seven seconds left in the game. Leading 15‚Äì14, Furman quarterback Billy Napier's pass was intercepted by Josh Jeffries at the four-yard line. He lateraled the ball to Derrick Black, who returned it for a score, giving the Mountaineers a 16‚Äì15 win. A similar play occurred during a Monday Night Football game between the Chargers and Chiefs on October 31, 2011. Tied 20‚Äì20, the Chargers offense marched the ball down the field to the Chiefs' 15-yard line. With one minute left, the Chiefs had no timeouts and the Chargers could run the clock down to the final seconds. Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers snapped the ball with the intent to simply fall down and to the left, to line up kicker Nick Novak for the game-winning field goal. However, on the snap, the football jammed into Rivers' ring finger, visibly dislocating it, causing Rivers to fumble the ball. Chiefs linebacker Andy Studebaker recovered the fumble in the resulting scrum. The Chiefs went on to win in overtime 23‚Äì20. Rivers was seen on the sidelines mouthing the words \\"This is the worst day ever.\\" As a result of the win, the Chiefs moved into a three-way tie for the lead in the AFC West. Another occurrence capped Kansas State's 38‚Äì35 comeback victory November 21, 2015, over Iowa State. Kansas State had rallied from a 35‚Äì14 halftime deficit to pull to within one touchdown. With 1:31 left, Iowa State having possession on first down and the Wildcats having just one time out remaining, the Cyclones chose instead to run the ball before fumbling the ball away; Kansas State would tie the game on the ensuing possession. On Iowa State's next series, starting with 50 seconds remaining, the Cyclones again chose to run a play rather than take a knee and send the game into overtime, but quarterback Joel Lanning was sacked on second down and lost possession of the ball, ultimately leading to a game-winning field goal by the Wildcats. Iowa State coach Paul Rhoads' play-calling in the final 90 seconds of the game, the culmination of a difficult 2015 season for ISU, ultimately led to his firing. Other uses On September 23, 1991, in a Monday Night game between the New York Jets and the Chicago Bears, the Jets were leading 13‚Äì6 and had the ball with two minutes remaining. With thousands of fans already having given up and headed to the Soldier Field parking lot, running back Blair Thomas took a handoff. Bears defensive tackle Steve McMichael stopped Thomas cold and then proceeded to wrestle the ball from his grasp, falling on the fumble at the Jets' 36-yard line with 1:54 remaining. On the final play of regulation, Jim Harbaugh threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Neal Anderson; Bears kicker Kevin Butler tied the game with the extra point. In overtime, Harbaugh scored from the one-yard line to clinch the win for Chicago. On October 23, 2000, the New York Jets overcame a 30‚Äì7 fourth-quarter deficit in a Monday Night Football (MNF) contest against the Miami Dolphins to win 40‚Äì37 in overtime. It was the greatest comeback in MNF history, and was later voted the best Monday Night Football game ever by the show's fans. Jets fans have referred to this game, too, as \\"The Miracle at the Meadowlands\\", though it is known throughout the NFL as the Monday Night Miracle. A punt return by Brian Westbrook of the Eagles with 1:16 left on the clock on October 19, 2003 is occasionally referenced as a \\"Miracle at the Meadowlands\\". The play and subsequent extra point gave the Eagles a 14‚Äì10 victory over the Giants at Giants Stadium. On December 14, 2008, the New York Jets were trailing the Buffalo Bills 27‚Äì24 with 1:45 left. The Jets had struggled to stop the Bills running game the entire day and the Bills were currently in possession of the ball on their own 20-yard line when Bills quarterback J. P. Losman ran a play action option. Jets safety Abram Elam sacked Losman and caused a fumble, which Jets defensive end Shaun Ellis picked up and ran for a touchdown to give the Jets a 31‚Äì27 victory (on the next Bills possession, Losman was picked off by cornerback Darrelle Revis). The New York Post ran an article the next day referring to the game as the Miracle at the Meadowlands sequel. The \\"Miracle at the New Meadowlands\\" was played on December 19, 2010. The Giants were leading the Eagles by a score of 31‚Äì10 with 7:28 left in the 4th quarter. The Eagles mounted a comeback by scoring 28 points culminating in a game-winning touchdown as time expired to win 38‚Äì31. Giants punter Matt Dodge kicked to DeSean Jackson on the final play, which resulted in a 65-yard punt return touchdown, as time expired.

From August 1991 to January 1992 he shot eleven people in the Stockholm and Uppsala area, most of whom were immigrants, killing one and seriously injuring the others. He first used a rifle equipped with a laser sight (hence his nickname), and later switched to a revolver. He was arrested in June 1992 and sentenced to life imprisonment in January 1994. Additionally, in February 2018 he was sentenced to life imprisonment in Germany for the 1992 murder of Blanka Zmigrod. Early life Ausonius was born Wolfgang Alexander Zaugg in Liding√∂, northeast of Stockholm, Sweden. He is the son of a Swiss father and a German mother, both of whom had emigrated to Sweden. He grew up in V√§llingby, a working class suburb of Stockholm. According to newspaper reports, he was bullied as a child because of his non-Swedish background, which manifested in him being teased for having very black hair and brown eyes. As an adult, he bleached his hair blonde, used blue contact lenses and legally changed his name. Initially, he changed his name to John Wolfgang Alexander Stannerman, and later to John Wolfgang Alexander Ausonius. He went to the German School in Stockholm, a private school, but dropped out before graduating. He later completed his secondary school education in an adult education programme. Ausonius was accepted into the Royal Institute of Technology, but dropped out after a couple of years of unsuccessful study. In 1986, following the Olof Palme assassination, Ausonius, then named John Stannerman, was one of the police's initial suspects. However, Stannerman could not be linked to the murder as he was incarcerated at the time, serving a sentence for multiple counts of assault. In prison he became an acquaintance of Miro Bare≈°iƒá, a member of Croatian National Resistance, a Croatian √©migr√© anti-communist organization created by members of the fascist Usta≈°e movement. Bare≈°iƒá was imprisoned for the 1971 murder of Vladimir Roloviƒá, the Yugoslav ambassador to Sweden. Ausonius developed a hatred for Communists, Social Democrats, and immigrants while fostering an ambition of gaining wealth. He worked a low-paying job as a taxi driver, but later started trading in stocks and bonds. His talent for the market quickly earned him a fairly large fortune, resulting in him adopting the yuppie lifestyle. By the late 1980s he owned a luxurious apartment, a Toyota Supra (rather than owning a Porsche, which many other yuppies drove at that time, as he despised the company), and a mobile phone (before the 1990s, such a device was a luxury item usually associated with a jet-set lifestyle). However, poorly chosen investments depleted his fortune. This was further aggravated by an addiction to gambling. As a result of the latter, during a trip to Germany he found himself in dire economic circumstances. With funds running out, Ausonius turned to bank robbing to maintain his lifestyle. He performed more than eighteen robberies, largely in identical fashion. Shooting spree In 1979, Ausonius became a Swedish citizen. He had a strong hatred for immigrants and foreigners. These beliefs led him to start looking for immigrant criminals to kill. Eventually, he was tired of this and decided to simply kill any immigrant. He hoped that this way, he would scare all immigrants out of Sweden. Between 1981 and 1982, Ausonius served in the Swedish army and thus learnt how to use weapons. However, his personal weapons were of poor quality, very likely because Ausonius had modified them. He sawed off the barrel and the stock of his first rifle to make it shorter, and he fitted the Smith & Wesson revolver with a silencer. This modification may have been the key to his failures in killing most of his victims as it deviated the bullet's trajectory and consequently caused him to miss his victims. It was amateurishly done and damaged the weapon's performance. *3 August 1991: Ausonius shot David Gebremariam, a 21-year-old immigrant from Eritrea. Gebremariam was shot in the back, but survived. Two of the victim's friends said they saw a circle of red light on his body before they heard the shot. *21 October 1991: Shahram Khosravi, a 25-year-old student of Iranian origin, was shot in the face outside the Stockholm University. Khosravi survived the attack. *27 October 1991: Dimitrios Karamalegos, a homeless man of Greek origin, was shot twice in the stomach. Although wounded, he survived. Karamalegos reported seeing a bright red light prior to hearing the shots. *1 November 1991: During the middle of the day, Ausonius walked into a restaurant kitchen in Stockholm and shot Heberson Vieira Da Costa, a musician from Brazil. Da Costa was shot once in the head and several times in the stomach. Despite these injuries, Da Costa survived. He reported to police that he saw a red light before he was shot. Da Costa was also able to provide a good description of Ausonius. *8 November 1991: Ausonius mortally wounded Jimmy Ranjbar, another Iranian student, who died the following day. Between the first and second wave of shooting, Ausonius took a trip to the United States. He visited Las Vegas to gamble and also journeyed to the Grand Canyon. He then returned to Sweden. *22 January 1992: In Uppsala, Ausonius walked up to a couple in a caf√© outside the Linnaeus Garden, and shot Erik Bongcam-Rudloff, a PhD student in medical sciences, in the head. Bongcam-Rudloff survived, and is now a scientist representing Sweden in several international scientific networks.\\"ISCB Conference\\" *23 January 1992: Having returned to Stockholm, Ausonius shot Charles Dhlakama, a bus driver originally from Zimbabwe, in the middle of the day. Dhlakama was shot in the chest but survived. That evening, Ausonius walked into a Somali club and shot two men, both of whom survived. *28 January 1992: Ausonius shot Isa Aybar, an immigrant of Syrian/Assyrian/Aramean origin, four times in the head and arm. Aybar was seriously wounded, but managed to call the police and survived. *30 January 1992: In H√§gerstens√•sen, Ausonius shot Hasan Zatara, a Palestinian store owner, in the head paralyzing, but not killing him. Zatara's son Imad Zatara is a footballer. Capture and trial The police started a massive manhunt (second in size only to the hunt for Olof Palme's killer). On 12 June 1992, during a bank robbery, Ausonius was arrested. He later assaulted his own lawyer in court and spent the rest of his trial in handcuffs. He was convicted of murder and robbery, but could not be linked to all of the shootings (although he confessed to all of them in 2000). He was sentenced to life imprisonment and was later incarcerated at Kumla Prison. In June 2012, he was transferred to √ñster√•ker Prison. Ausonius has applied to have his life sentence commuted to a fixed term on three occasions, in 2008, 2010, and 2012. The court has rejected his application on all occasions. On 2 November 2012, his third appeal was rejected by the √ñrebro District Court. On all three occasions the National Board of Forensic Medicine determined that there was a risk that Ausonius would reoffend due to his autism and personality disorder, which the court took into consideration when making its decision.  Trial for German murder  In 2016 Ausonius was extradited to Germany to face trial for the 23 February 1992 murder in Frankfurt of Blanka Zmigrod, a 68-year-old Holocaust survivor. While investigating, German police looked into ties to far-right terror group National Socialist Underground.\\"Lasermannen\\", Die Welt, 16-12-2016 (in German) On 21 February 2018 he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment in Germany. Prosecutors had charged him with stealing her handbag after killing her because he thought she had taken an electronic device that he used to save his bank account numbers.  Media  The journalist Gellert Tamas wrote a book about the case, Lasermannen - en ber√§ttelse om Sverige (2002), which became a bestseller. The book, which is very detailed, was published without consulting the victims first. The author's personal opinions not only deal with Ausonius and his life story, but also with Sweden in general, speculating that his actions were in part explained by a surge of xenophobic sentiments in the country in the early 1990s, including the success of the Ny Demokrati right-wing party in the election. According to Tamas, it could also be one of many attempts by Ausonius to prove his identity as a \\"true Swedish man by separating himself from immigrants.P3 Dokument√§r: \\"Lasermannen\\", Sveriges Radio P3, 5-5-2006 (in Swedish) In 2005, the book was adapted into a play, and the same year SVT produced a three-part TV miniseries, which premiered on 23 November. Ausonius was played by David Dencik. Engagement In late April 2006, the daily Aftonbladet revealed that John Ausonius had become engaged to an anonymous 23-year-old woman, who had fallen in love with him after having seen a recent television miniseries. According to the paper, a friend of the woman said the couple were planning to move abroad after Ausonius' putative release from prison by 2031. The couple is no longer together.

It was founded in 1991 by Linda Wells. Michelle Lee replaced Wells in 2015. A signature of the magazine is its annual Best of Beauty awards‚Äîaccolades given in the October issue to beauty products deemed the best by Allure's staff. History In 1990, S.I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Cond√© Nast, and then editorial director Alexander Liberman approached Linda Wells to develop a concept they had for a beauty magazine. At the time, Wells was the beauty editor and the food editor at The New York Times Magazine.Smith, Stephanie D., \\"Allure Survives Early Blemishes and Turns 15\\", Women's Wear Daily, October 20, 2006. The magazine's prototype was shredded shortly before the scheduled launch date and, after overhauling everything (including the logo), Allure made its debut in March 1991 designed by Lucy Sisman. The magazine's original format was oversize, but this prevented it from fitting into slots at grocery-store checkouts and required advertisers to resize their ads or create new ones. After four issues, Allure changed to a standard-size glossy format. Impact Allure focuses on beauty, fashion, and women's health. Allure was the first women's magazine to write about the health risks associated with silicone breast implants, and has reported on other controversial health issues. After Lee took the helm in late 2015, the brand was celebrated for promoting diversity and inclusivity. In 2017, Adweek named Allure Magazine of the Year and awarded Lee as Editor of the Year.\\"14 Magazines Shaking Up the Publishing Industry, One Reinvention at a Time\\", Adweek.

The committee was tasked to examine political, economic and social conditions in Mandatory Palestine as they bear upon the problem of Jewish immigration and settlement therein and the well-being of the peoples now living therein; to consult representatives of Arabs and Jews, and to make other recommendations 'as may be necessary' to for ad interim handling of these problems as well as for their permanent solution.Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry - Preface The report, entitled \\"Report of the Anglo-American Committee of Enquiry Regarding the Problems of European Jewry and Palestine\\",Cmd 6808, National Archives PRO 30/78/30 was published in Lausanne on 20 April 1946. World War II ended in Europe on 8 May 1945 and in Asia on 2 September 1945; in the United States Harry S. Truman had become president on 12 April of that year and in the United Kingdom Clement Attlee became Prime Minister on 5 July 1945. Following the Harrison Report, in August 1945 president Truman asked Britain for admission of 100,000 Holocaust survivors into Palestine, beginning a negotiation on Palestine between the two powers. On 13 November 1945, Attlee's foreign minister Ernest Bevin announced the formation of the Anglo-American Commission.PALESTINE (ANGLO-AMERICAN COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY), HC Deb 13 November 1945 vol 415 cc1927-35 The British government suggested the joint inquiry in effort to secure American co- responsibility for a Palestinian policy, fearing Arab resistance to an influx of Jewish immigrants into Palestine. The report dealt with five subjects: immigration, land, form of government, development, and security. It recommended the admission of 100,000 displaced Jews, the annulment of the Land Transfer Regulations restricting Jewish purchasing of Arab land set forth by White Paper of 1939 and that Palestine shall be neither a Jewish state nor an Arab state. The United States' decision to jointly lead the inquiry is considered to have been driven by a desire to \\"clip the wings of political Zionism by treating the whole matter as a Jewish refugee problem\\". Moshe Sneh of the Jewish Agency noted on 11 December 1945 at an Inner Meeting of the Jewish Agency that \\"America's agreement to participate in the Committee was undertaken in order to strip us of our main argument...with which to appeal to the Americans against an English committee... the introduction of America is tantamount to disarming us.\\" Nachmani wrote that the decision to include Palestine into the committee's scope was also not in the best interests of the Zionists. The British had conditioned the implementation of the report's recommendations on the admission of 100,000 new Jewish immigrants contingent on US providing assistance in case of Arab revolt. It wasn't offered and the British government, continued to carry out its White Paper of 1939 policy. The plan was the base for \\"The Morrison-Grady Plan\\", calling for federalization under overall British trusteeship. Ultimately this Committee plans' as well was rejected by both Arabs and Jews; and Britain decided to refer the problem to the United Nations. Background David Ben-Gurion testifying before the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry In 1917, Britain drafted the Balfour Declaration, becoming the first Great Power to support Zionist calls for a 'Jewish National Home' in Palestine. Shortly thereafter, Britain defeated the Ottoman Empire in World War I and as a result took control of Palestine. The Balfour Declaration was recognized by the Great Powers and incorporated into the Treaty of S√®vres. The Great Powers once again incorporated the declaration into the draft Mandate for Palestine that they submitted to the Council of the League of Nations.Balfour's remarks from the League of Nations Official Journal: 30 June 1922 The US Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles and as a consequence the United States never joined the League of Nations. The House and Senate passed a non-binding Joint Resolution, HR 360, 30 June 1922 favoring the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine. On 21 September 1922, President Warren G. Harding also signed the resolution. A commission had been proposed by the United States at the Peace Conference as an international effort to determine if the region was ready for self- determination and to see what nations, if any, the locals wanted to act as mandatory powers. The report of the King-Crane Commission was not made public until after the Congress had voted on their Joint resolution. Public opinion was divided when it was learned that the Arab majority had requested that the mandate be administered by the United States, and that they intended to establish a democratically elected constituent assembly. The rise of Nazism and the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine led the British to reverse the Balfour Declaration in the 1939 White Paper. This policy placed a limit of allowing 75,000 more Jews into Palestine (by 1949) after which Jewish migration was to be terminated. An independent state in Palestine with an Arab majority was to be established by 1948. In response to the White Paper, land sales to Jews were severely restricted by a 1940 law. The end of World War II and the Holocaust left Europe with hundreds of thousands of displaced Jewish refugees. American public opinion supported a Jewish Homeland in Palestine, and in August 1945 president Truman asked for admission of 100,000 Holocaust survivors into PalestineWilliam roger louis, 1985, p. 386 but Britain persisted in opposing Jewish immigration, fearing damage to its extensive and vulnerable empire in the Middle-East. Britain ruled oil-rich Kuwait, The Arab Emirates, Oman and Bahrain. It also controlled Jordan and Yemen and had treaties binding it to Iraq (where the oil industry was British owned) and Egypt (where Britain administered the Suez canal). With the Jews in Palestine waging an underground war against the British occupation, the refugee situation was critical and British and American policy was at loggerheads. Committee =Members= The committee comprised six Americans and six British. Judge Joseph Hutcheson was the American chairman. He was joined by Frank Aydelotte, William Phillips, Frank W. Buxton (editor, Boston Herald), James G. McDonald, and Bartley Crum. The group was a diverse group of diplomats, scholars, and politicians, most in favor of the proposal that 100,000 displaced persons be admitted to Palestine. The British contingent was chaired by Sir John Singleton, with the remaining members being Lord Morrison, Sir Frederick Leggett, Wilfrid Crick, Reginald Manningham-Buller, and Richard Crossman. =Evidence provided= Front cover of the Survey of Palestine, prepared as evidence for the Committee Evidence was provided by the Government of Palestine, the Jewish authorities and the Arab authorities.Nachmani, \\"The Evidence, p. 97 =Journey= The Committee visited Washington, D.C. and London to gauge the official American and British policies and positions towards Palestine. They proceeded to Vienna, where they visited a displaced persons camp and interviewed Holocaust survivors, then Cairo to discuss Arab sentiments. The Committee then visited Palestine and spent three weeks there. They visited Jewish and Arab areas, and heard testimony from or held meetings with many Jewish, Arab, and British officials. They finally retired to Lausanne to debate and draft their findings.Hoffman, Bruce: Anonymous Soldiers (2015) During their stay in Vienna they surveyed Jewish Holocaust survivors as to their preferred destination. 98% said Palestine. \\"In Poland, Hungary and Rumania, the chief desire is to get out, to get away somewhere where there is a chance of building up a new life, of finding some happiness, of living in peace and in security. In Germany also, where the number of Jews has been reduced from about 500,000 in 1933 to about 20,000 now, and most traces of Jewish life have been destroyed, there is a similar desire on the part of a large proportion of the survivors to make a home elsewhere, preferably in Palestine. In Czechoslovakia, particularly in Bohemia and Moravia, and in Austria, the position in regard to the reestablishment of the Jewish populations is more hopeful. The vast majority of the Jewish displaced persons and migrants, however, believe that the only place which offers a prospect is Palestine.\\" (Anglo-American Committee of inquiry, chapter 2 paragraph 12) =Recommendations= Judah Leon Magnes and Martin Buber testifying before the Anglo-American Committee (1946) During a committee meeting Bevin told the committee that he would accept their decision if it were unanimous[The British Empire in the Middle East, 1945-1951: Arab Nationalism, the United States, and Postwar Imperialism, By William Roger Louis , 12985, p. 407] Hence, In April 1946, the Committee decided unanimously. Its recommendations were as follows: Recommendation No. 1. We have to report that such information as we received about countries other than Palestine gave no hope of substantial assistance in finding homes for Jews wishing or impelled to leave Europe. But Palestine alone cannot meet the emigration needs of the Jewish victims of Nazi and Fascist persecution; the whole world shares responsibility for them and indeed for the resettlement of all \\"displaced persons\\". We therefore recommend that our Governments together, and in association with other countries, should endeavor immediately to find new homes for all such \\"displaced persons\\", irrespective of creed or nationality, whose ties with their former communities have been irreparably broken. Though emigration will solve the problems of some victims of persecution, the overwhelming majority, including a considerable number of Jews, will continue to live in Europe. We recommend therefore that our Governments endeavor to secure that immediate effect is given to the provision of the United Nations Charter calling for \\"universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\\". Recommendation No. 2. We recommend (a) that 100,000 certificates be authorized immediately for the admission into Palestine of Jews who have been the victims of Nazi and Fascist persecution; (b) that these certificates be awarded as far as possible in 1946 and that actual immigration be pushed forward as rapidly as conditions will permit. Recommendation No. 3. In order to dispose, once and for all, of the exclusive claims of Jews and Arabs to Palestine, we regard it as essential that a clear statement of the following principles should be made: *I. That Jew shall not dominate Arab and Arab shall not dominate Jew in Palestine. *II. That Palestine shall be neither a Jewish state nor an Arab state. *III. That the form of government ultimately to be established, shall, under international guarantees, fully protect and preserve the interests in the Holy Land of Christendom and of the Moslem and Jewish faiths. Thus Palestine must ultimately become a state which guards the rights and interests of Moslems, Jews and Christians alike; and accords to the inhabitants, as a whole, the fullest measure of self-government, consistent with the three paramount principles set forth above. Recommendation No. 4. We have reached the conclusion that the hostility between Jews and Arabs and, in particular, the determination of each to achieve domination, if necessary by violence, make it almost certain that, now and for some time to come, any attempt to establish either an independent Palestinian State or independent Palestinian States would result in civil strife such as might threaten the peace of the world. We therefore recommend that, until this hostility disappears, the Government of Palestine be continued as at present under mandate pending the execution of a trusteeship agreement under the United Nations. Recommendation No. 5. Looking towards a form of ultimate self-government, consistent with the three principles laid down in Recommendation No. 3, we recommend that the mandatory or trustee should proclaim the principle that Arab economic, educational and political advancement in Palestine is of equal importance with that of the Jews; and should at once prepare measures designed to bridge the gap which now exists and raise the Arab standard of living to that of the Jews; and so bring the two peoples to a full appreciation of their common interest and common destiny in the land where both belong. Recommendation No. 6. We recommend that, pending the early reference to the United Nations and the execution of a trusteeship agreement, the mandatory should administer Palestine according to the mandate which declares with regard to immigration that \\"The administration of Palestine, while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced, shall facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions\\". Recommendation No. 7. (a) We recommend that the Land Transfers Regulations of 1940 be rescinded and replaced by regulations based on a policy of freedom in the sale, lease or use of land, irrespective of race, community or creed, and providing adequate protection for the interests of small owners and tenant cultivators; (b) We further recommend that steps be taken to render nugatory and to prohibit provisions in conveyances, leases and agreements relating to land which stipulate that only members of one races community or creed may be employed on or about or in connection therewith; (c) We recommend that the Government should exercise such close supervision over the Holy Places and localities such as the Sea of Galilee and its vicinity as will protect them from desecration and from uses which offend the conscience of religious people, and that such laws as are required for this purpose be enacted forthwith. Recommendation No. 8. Various plans for large-scale agricultural and industrial development in Palestine have been presented for our consideration; these projects, if successfully carried into effect, could not only greatly enlarge the capacity of the country to support an increasing population but also raise the living standards of Jew and Arab alike. We are not in a position to assess the soundness of these specific plans; but we cannot state too strongly that, however technically feasible they may be, they will fail unless there is peace in Palestine. Moreover, their full success requires the willing cooperation of adjacent Arab states, since they are not merely Palestinian projects. We recommend therefore that the examination, discussion and execution of these plans be conducted, from the start and throughout, in full consultation and cooperation not only with the Jewish Agency but also with the governments of the neighboring Arab States directly affected. Recommendation No. 9. We recommend that, in the interests of the conciliation of the two peoples and of general improvement of the Arab standard of living, the educational system of both Jews and Arabs be reformed, including the introduction of compulsory education within a reasonable time. Recommendation No. 10. We recommend that, if this Report is adopted, it should be made clear beyond all doubt to both Jews and Arabs that any attempt from either side, by threats of violence, by terrorism, or by the organization or use of illegal armies to prevent its execution, will be resolutely suppressed. Furthermore, we express the view that the Jewish Agency should at once resume active cooperation with the Mandatory in the suppression of terrorism and of illegal immigration, and in the maintenance of that law and order throughout Palestine which is essential for the good of all, including the new immigrants. Aftermath Provincial Autonomy Plan proposed by the Morrison- Grady committee U.S President Harry S. Truman endorsed the committee's recommendation that 100,000 Jewish refugees be immediately admitted into Palestine, and the right of the Jews to purchase land,Morris, 2008, p. 34 but did not acknowledge the rest of the committee's findings, angering the British Labour Party. Within several days of the release of the committee's findings, its implementation was in jeopardy. The British government and military believed that neither the Jews or Arabs would accept the committee's recommendations. British Prime Minister Clement Attlee arranged a group of senior officials, who were to coordinate with the Chiefs of Staff, to prepare an analysis of the committee's recommendations. They concluded that the Jews would not accept anything short of partition, and that not only would the guerrilla raids by the Irgun and Lehi paramilitary groups continue, the Haganah might react by launching widespread attacks. In addition, the report concluded that there would likely be a general Arab uprising in Palestine, with financial and material backing from the surrounding Arab states. Although Bevin told the committee that he would accept their decision if it were unanimous, Attlee opposed the recommendation of a mass immigration until the Yishuv was disarmed (which he knew was a nonstarter). The British government, adamant that it would not bear the costs of resettling 100,000 Jewish immigrants, funding Arab development, and in disarming the Yishuv and suppressing any rebellion, by itself, conditioned the implementation of the report's recommendations on military and financial assistance from the United States. The British cabinet agreed that the report should be rejected unless the US government was willing to provide financial and military assistance. Britain requested that the US government make two infantry divisions and at least one armored brigade available for immediate deployment to Palestine. The United States War Department had issued an earlier report which stated that an open-ended US troop commitment of 300,000 personnel would be necessary to assist the British government in maintaining order against an Arab revolt. However, the US government was, like the British government, eager to rapidly demobilize many of its citizens still under arms, and rejected the request.American Jewish History: An Eight-volume Series By Jeffrey S Gurock, American Jewish Historical Society, page 243 In October 1946, the British government decided to gradually allow 96,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine at the rate of 1,500 a month. Half of those admitted would be Jews who had attempted to illegally immigrate to Palestine and were being held in the Cyprus internment camps; the British feared that if the population of the camps continued growing, there would be an uprising among the prisoners.New York Times 11/08/46, p. 35. UK Foreign Office document 371/52651 =The Morrison-Grady Plan= After the Anglo-American Committee issued its report, a new committee was created to establish how the Anglo-American proposals would be implemented. It was led by British cabinet minister Herbert Morrison and US ambassador Henry F. Grady. In July 1946, it proposed \\"The Morrison-Grady Plan\\" a plan for unitary federal trusteeship in Palestine. Jewish and Arab provinces would exercise self-rule under British oversight, while Jerusalem and the Negev would remain under direct British control. The plan became the point of departure for a Palestine Conference convened by the British on 1 October 1946. However the Arabs rejected the plan on the grounds that it would lead to partition, while the Jews refused to even attend. The Arabs instead proposed an independent unitary state. At a later meeting of the Conference the following February, Britain proposed a plan, known as the Bevin Plan, for a 5-year British trusteeship. The trusteeship was to lead to a permanent settlement agreed by all parties. When both the Arab and Jewish sides rejected the plan, Britain decided to refer the problem to the United Nations.

To restore Folkman's confidence, Erd≈ës immediately challenged him to solve mathematical problems. The Man Who Loved Only Numbers is a biography of the famous mathematician Paul Erd≈ës written by Paul Hoffman. The book was first published on July 15, 1998, by Hyperion Books as a hardcover edition. A paperback edition appeared in 1999. The book is, in the words of the author, \\"a work in oral history based on the recollections of Erd≈ës, his collaborators and their spouses\\". The book was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and has been published in 15 different languages. The book won the 1999 Rh√¥ne-Poulenc Prize beating many distinguished and established writers, including E. O. Wilson.Prizes for Science Books previous winners and shortlists, The Royal Society website How the book came about Hoffman received an assignment by The Atlantic Monthly in 1987 to profile Erd≈ës, which won the National Magazine Award for feature writing. After this, Hoffman followed Erd≈ës on his travels for the last 10 years of his life learning about his exceedingly unusual life and interviewing his numerous collaborators in the process of writing this book. Content A large part of the book concerns Erd≈ës, but a lot of it is about other mathematicians, past and present, including Ronald Graham, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Srinivasa Ramanujan, and G.H. Hardy. In the book, Erd≈ës enjoys listening to Hardy when he speaks about Ramanujan. Hoffman also tries to give examples of what mathematics is and why he views it as important, and why many mathematicians such as Erd≈ës devote their whole lives to mathematics. It also contains some history of Europe and the United States of Erd≈ës's time. The book, on the whole, portrays Erd≈ës in a favourable light, pointing out his many endearing qualities, like his childlike simplicity, his generosity and altruistic nature, his kindness and gentleness towards children. However, it also attempts to illustrate his helplessness in doing mundane tasks, the difficulties faced by those close to him because of his eccentricities, and his stubborn and frustrating behaviour. =Erd≈ës's nursing of Jon Folkman= Hoffman reports the following anecdote, which displays Erd≈ës's single-minded devotion to his friends and mathematics. In the late 1960s, the young mathematician Jon Folkman was diagnosed as having advanced brain cancer. During Folkman's hospitalization, he was visited repeatedly by Ronald Graham and Paul Erd≈ës. After his brain surgery, Folkman was despairing that he had lost his mathematical skills. As soon as Folkman received Graham and Erd≈ës at the hospital, Erd≈ës challenged Folkman with mathematical problems, helping to rebuild his confidence. Hoffman notes that Folkman's recovery was short-lived. Notwithstanding his ability to solve the problems posed by Erd≈ës, Folkman purchased a gun and killed himself. Folkman's supervisor at RAND, Delbert Ray Fulkerson, blamed himself for failing to notice suicidal behaviors in Folkman. Years later Fulkerson also killed himself.. Writing style The book is mostly written without much technical detail and can be read by anyone without a mathematical background. Hoffman does give some relatively simple examples of mathematical problems throughout the book (like Cantor's diagonal argument) to illustrate some of the ideas in modern mathematics.

The sequel to Croc: Legend of the Gobbos, it revolves around the title character going on a quest to search for his missing parents, as well as saving the Inventor Gobbo from a revived Baron Dante. Croc 2 was released for the Sony PlayStation in 1999, and later for Microsoft Windows and Game Boy Color in 2000 and 2001, respectively. A port of the game for the Dreamcast was also planned but ultimately cancelled. The game's release was accompanied by a heavy advertising campaign, with Fox cross-promoting the game alongside Nabisco's \\"Gummi Savers\\" brand of candy. Croc 2 received mixed reviews, with critics particularly praising the game's graphics while criticizing its camera and difficulty. Gameplay A screenshot from the game showing Croc's health in the top-left and the collectable gems in the top- right. Croc 2 features gameplay similar to its predecessor; the player controls Croc through various open-ended levels in order to complete various missions. The game's levels are split across 4 Gobbo \\"villages,\\" and are accessed through an open HUB world. The missions involve helping other Gobbos with a certain task, such as rescuing another Gobbo who is trapped within a steel cage and chasing a Dantini through a stage in order to retrieve a stolen sandwich. After completing a certain number of levels in a village, a boss level is opened up, which allows access to the next village when completed. Certain levels involve riding a vehicle through a course, including a race car, a speedboat, a hang glider, a hot air balloon and a giant snowball among others. Levels contain various collectible items, including 100 crystals and 5 multicolored crystals scattered throughout the stage. The colored gems are hidden in different places throughout the stage, and require completing a platform challenge or completing a puzzle in order to be retrieved. Finding all 5 colored gems makes a golden trophy appear at the end of the level that is collected by traversing through a small platforming challenge. Collecting every trophy in a village allows access to an extra level that can be completed in order to collect a Jigsaw puzzle piece; collecting these pieces is required in order to access the game's fifth and final village containing the final boss. Several items can be purchased at the HUB worlds from Swap Meet Pete, an anthropomorphic cat, some of which are needed to access certain areas and secrets within the game. Among these items are heart pots, which lengthen Croc's maximum life count, Gummi Savers Jumps, which can be used as a trampoline in order to reach certain ledges, and the Clockwork Gobbo, a small wind-up robot that can be controlled to collect items by being used on a certain pedestal. Croc is controlled using the D-pad or the analog stick, and maneuvers levels by running, jumping, climbing and swimming; new to the game are the abilities to perform a triple jump and a flip jump, both of which allow Croc to reach higher altitudes than he can by jumping normally. Croc attacks enemies by swinging his tail in a full 360-degree motion, and can also perform a downward hit drop in order to defeat enemies as well as destroy wooden crates containing items. Croc's health is represented by a set life count that can be extended by purchasing certain items; upon running out of \\"hearts\\", he is sent back to the HUB world of the respective level he's in. Croc's life can be refilled by collecting large hearts located throughout stages, as well by collecting a certain amount of crystals in a stage. Croc 2 features an additional control option titled \\"OmniPlay,\\" which gives two people split control over Croc's movements and abilities for cooperative gameplay. Plot Set several months after Croc: Legend of the Gobbos, the Dantinis plot the return of Baron Dante. Professor Gobbo is captured when he witnesses Dante's resurrection. Back at Gobbo Valley, Croc is playing on a beach and finds a message in a bottle. The message explains that the senders are looking for their child. Croc is surprised and takes the message to King Rufus, who reads it and tells Croc that he needs to look for other Gobbos far off, who may be able to help him in finding the crocodiles who sent the message. A large number of Gobbos make a see-saw. Croc stands on one end and a Gobbo pushes a boulder on to the other end to propel Croc to the distant mainland, where his search begins. Development A Dreamcast port of the game was planned, having been mentioned in the UK print of the Dreamcast Monthly magazine and touted for release in Q3 of 2000, but was cancelled in light of Argonaut's decision to stop developing Dreamcast games due to the declining commercial performance of the system. Promotion and release Croc 2 was originally advertised in the instruction manual of the original game for a release on the PlayStation and Sega Saturn for a Christmas 1998 release; however, the game was later delayed to a summer 1999 release, and the Sega Saturn version of the game was ultimately never released. A Dreamcast port was also planned yet cancelled in mid-2000. It also got a 2D platformer of the same name released in 2001 on Game Boy Color. The game was heavily advertised during its release, with a multi-million advertisement campaign entailing television commercials, retail support, and customer incentives. A cross- promotional brand deal was held with Nabisco to promote the game alongside the company's Gummi Savers line of gummy candy. Alongside the candy being prominently featured as a usable item within the game, over 6.5 million candy wrappers were printed with Croc 2 logos on them. A promotional sweepstake competition, called the \\"Croc 2 Down Under\\" sweepstakes, was held during the game's release, with the contest's grand prize consisting of a family trip to Australia, as well as a copy of the game, a PlayStation console, and a copy of the game's strategy guide being featured as the other obtainable prizes. Reception Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Croc 2 is one of the better 3D platformers on PlayStation, if just by a claw.\\" Croc 2 received mixed reviews upon release. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the Game Boy Color version 74.22%, the PlayStation version 69.65% and the PC version 67.17%. IGN gave the game an overall 7.5/10 for the PlayStation version, praising the games voice acting, graphics, soundtrack and size but criticizing its difficulty and camera angles. NowGamer also gave the game a positive review, giving it 8.4/10, only criticizing its difficulty. GameSpot gave the game poor ratings, giving the PC version 5.8/10 and the PlayStation version 5.4/10, also criticizing the camera angles and the difficulty. Matthew House of Allgame reviewed the PlayStation version of the game and gave it a 2/5, also criticizing the game for its camera angles and difficulty, while also criticizing the game's graphics. GamePro was also negative, giving the game 3/5 and said \\"After weeks of playing Croc 2, I was praying each new level would be Croc 2's last, but it just kept dragging on and on\\".

The 26th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 7, 1991. In the episode, Homer gets an illegal cable hookup. Despite the family's enjoyment of the new channels, Lisa suspects they are stealing cable. Her suspicions are confirmed by Reverend Lovejoy and she protests by no longer watching television. Homer invites his friends to watch a cable-TV boxing match, but Lisa's protest persuades him to cut the cable when the fight ends. The episode was written by freelance writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It is based on the Eighth Commandment (\\"Thou shalt not steal\\"). The episode marks the debut of Troy McClure, who was voiced by Phil Hartman and based on the typical \\"washed up\\" Hollywood actor. The character Drederick Tatum, one of the boxers in the boxing match Homer and his friends watch, also makes his first appearance on the show in this episode. In its original broadcast, \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\\" received a Nielsen rating of 15.2, finishing 25th the week it aired. It received favorable reviews from critics and became the second episode of The Simpsons to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour). Plot After seeing Ned Flanders reject an offer from a crooked cable man for a $50 illegal cable hookup, Homer chases after the cable man and takes the offer. The Simpsons like the new channels and spend hours watching them. However, Lisa is suspicious about the cable hookup, and after a Sunday school lesson about the existence and nature of Hell, she fears that Homer is violating the Eighth of the Ten Commandments -- \\"thou shalt not steal\\" -- and will go to Hell when he dies. After seeing other examples of common thievery everywhere, Lisa visits Reverend Lovejoy. He dissuades Lisa from reporting her father's illegal cable hookup to the police since the Fifth Commandment states one must \\"honor thy father and thy mother\\", but instead advises her to lead by example and refuse to watch programs via the cable hookup. Marge pleads with Homer to either cut the cable or pay for it, but he refuses. However, after the cable man offers to sell him a stolen car stereo and attempts to break into Ned's house, Homer barricades his windows in fear. Bart charges the neighborhood children 50 cents to watch a cable porn channel, but Homer catches him and sends him to his room as punishment. Homer invites his co-workers and bar buddies to watch Drederick Tatum fight for the World Heavyweight Championship during a cable-TV boxing match. When Lisa announces she will boycott the screening, Homer banishes her to the lawn, where she is joined by Marge and Maggie. Eventually Homer's conscience bothers him and he begrudgingly chooses not to watch the fight, dragging Bart outside with him. When his friends leave, Homer hesitantly cuts the cable hookup over Bart's objections. Homer accidentally cuts the neighborhood's electric power when he severs the wrong cable. He cuts the right cable on his third try and the episode abruptly ends with static showing onscreen. Production This was the first episode in which Phil Hartman voiced Troy McClure. \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\\" was written by freelance writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It was originally going to be named \\"Homer vs. the 8th Commandment\\", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast to feel as if all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment (\\"thou shall not steal\\"), which is one of the Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that \\"whenever people come up to me and say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this [episode], where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences.\\" The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss feels that episodes such as \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\\" are his favorite episodes to write because they have a \\"solid theme or an issue\\" (in this case, religion and theft), that one can \\"discuss endlessly and just have it present itself in so many different ways\\". Producer Jeff Martin said the writers tried to use a \\"very strict construction of the Eighth Commandment,\\" considering cable theft to be \\"essentially a victimless crime\\". \\"Homer vs. the 8th Commandment\\" was produced at a time when illegal cable hookups were becoming commonplace in many homes. This episode later inspired the season four episode \\"Homer the Heretic\\", in which Homer stops going to church on Sundays. Based on the Fourth Commandment, \\"remember the Sabbath and keep it holy\\", that episode originated when Jean commented to Reiss, \\"We had a lot of luck with Homer stealing cable, so maybe we could look to other commandments?\\" The episode marks the debut appearance of the character Troy McClure, voiced by Phil Hartman. McClure was based on the typical \\"washed up\\" Hollywood actor, and B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure served as inspiration for his name and certain character aspects. According to show creator Matt Groening, Hartman was cast in the role due to his ability to pull \\"the maximum amount of humor\\" out of any line he was given. McClure's visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself. McClure became a recurring character on the show after \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\\", but was retired in 1998 after Hartman's death. In addition to McClure, Hartman also provided the voice of the cable guy. The character Drederick Tatum, one of the boxers in the boxing match Homer and his friends watch, also makes his first appearance on the show in this episode. His physical appearance was based on the American boxer Mike Tyson, and he was named after a real boxer Simpsons writer George Meyer had seen. Cultural references The opening scene with Moses on Mount Sinai parodies the 1956 film The Ten Commandments. The scene in which Homer stands in front of and is struck by the cable man's truck resembles a scene in Alfred Hitchcock's film North by Northwest. Drederick Tatum is based on Mike Tyson. In a joke about Mr. Burns' age, Burns recalls watching a bare-knuckle match between Gentleman Jim Corbett and \\"an Eskimo fellow\\". The films that are watched by the family on the new cable are Jaws, Die Hard, and Wall Street. One of the X-rated films Bart and his friends watch on cable is called Broadcast Nudes. The title parodies Broadcast News, which was written by Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks. At the end of the episode, Bart mentions Joe Franklin. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\\" finished 25th in ratings for the week of February 4‚Äì10, 1991 with a Nielsen rating of 15.2, and was viewed in approximately 14 million homes. It did better than the show's season average rank of 32nd, and was the highest rated program on Fox that week. The episode finished second in its timeslot to The Cosby Show, which aired at the same time on NBC and had a Nielsen rating of 16.8. In The Gospel According to The Simpsons, Mark I. Pinsky writes that the episode has \\"the structure of an exquisitely crafted twenty-two minute sermon\\". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson felt that \\"[The episode] helped establish the show's reputation as a master lampooner of pop culture. The introduction of cable into the home allowed [the writers] to mock many different movies and other media outlets, and this helped make the episode very entertaining. It also worked in many other ways and offered a fine show.\\" Writing for MacLean's magazine, Jaime J. Weinman described \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the Eighth Commandment\\" as \\"the first truly great episode ‚Äî the one that established The Simpsons as the funniest and most multi-layered sitcom around. The story of Homer stealing cable was an excuse for dozens of parodies of early 90s cable TV, but it was also a story about Homer and his daughter and an examination of how we rationalize little acts of theft in our daily lives.\\" The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode a \\"skilful demonstration of a moral dilemma that must have plagued millions since the inception of cable TV\\". Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, wrote that \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\\" is \\"one of the many demonstrations that while [The Simpsons] may have pushed the censorship envelope for its day, it remained moral to its core. The running satire of cable programs is also quite amusing.\\" The episode won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour). It was the second episode of the show to win the award. It was also nominated in the \\"Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special\\" category.

It is the second largest shopping centre in Australia by floor area.  History  Initially opening in November 1970, the centre was reconstructed and re-opened on 11 March 1980 by the Victorian Governor of the time, Sir Henry Winneke, with a Kmart and Coles being the major tenants. In September 1988, the adjacent homemaker centre opened. The centre was later purchased by the Westfield Group in July 1995 and was eventually extended and redeveloped into a much larger complex, which was completed by November 2001. The centre hosts a variety of major chains including Kmart, Coles, Woolworths, Big W, Target, Myer, Toy Kingdom, ALDI and approximately 320 other specialty stores. A major expansion of the complex took place between 2011 and 2012. Approved by the City of Casey in December 2007, the extension featured a new two-level 12,000m2 Myer store, a new 4,200m2 Coles store, in a new location near the former BI-LO, with the existing store shell being reconfigured with space for two new minor anchor stores, as well as providing increased retail space for Target, which increased from 6,884m2 to 8,368m2. David Jones had been set to open a store in the new expansion but terminated the contract with Westfield in July 2010, with Myer replacing David Jones in the expansion. David Jones had been trying to exit its contract with Westfield Group since 2003 as Fountain Gate did not fit the company's strategy or target demographic. Four new minor anchor retail spaces were constructed, as well as 114 new specialty store spaces and 1,500 new car parking spaces, with new ground-level parking surrounding the centre and new rooftop parking above the new mall areas. It is the location of the first-ever Krispy Kreme in Victoria. A new building has been added to the complex which is the City of Casey's vibrant new entertainment precinct, it is the creative and community heart of the region. This is the new home of the Narre Warren Library.  In popular culture  Fountain Gate Shopping Centre is named as the mall frequented by the characters in the popular television series Kath & Kim. Scenes in the show are filmed at Fountain Gate and at another Westfield complex, Westfield Southland. Fountain Gate Shopping Centre was a filming location in the feature film Bad Eggs where, in the first scene, a car rolls into the actual shopping centre; in the film, the mall is named Crystal Heights Shop Kingdom.  Transport  Narre Warren railway station is approximately 1 km away from the centre and is linked by a number of bus routes to Westfield Fountain Gate. Some regional buses also stop at Fountain Gate. The Hallam Bypass, a new section of the Monash Freeway opened in 2003, passes beside the complex and can be viewed from the windows in the food court. A trail known as the Hallam Bypass Trail, constructed at the same time, runs beside the centre on the north-east side, providing access for cyclists and pedestrians.

CUT was formed on 28 August 1983 in S√£o Bernardo do Campo, S√£o Paulo, during the First National Congress of the Working Class. Alongside the Workers' Party (PT) and the Landless Workers' Movement (MST), CUT was one of the key organizations to challenge the military rule of 1964‚Äì1985 during its final stages, organizing strikes in automobile factories located in the ABC Region. Nowadays, CUT is the largest and most important trade union federation in Brazil, representing over 7.4 million workers in all productive areas. It is also the largest trade union center in Latin America and the fifth largest in the world. Nevertheless, it continues to face obstacles because of corporatist laws that curb the workers' rights to organize. CUT generally supports a democratic socialist political ideology and is close to PT and its leaders, many of which had been union leaders in the past. CUT was organized to oppose the so-called \\"old labour movement\\", associated with the late President Get√∫lio Vargas and his Brazilian Labour Party (PTB). The main practice of varguismo and its leaders was to try to integrate trade unions and the Ministry of Labor, once the President had based his policy for the area using the Carta del Lavoro of Fascist Italy as a role model. CUT arose as an alternative to this model, claiming to be part of the \\"new labour movement\\", independent from the federal government. However, its close ties with PT made CUT a source of criticism after Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, PT's most prominent member, took office as President. In March 2004, some union leaders unsatisfied with the organization's close ties with the Lula administration split from CUT in order to form the Coordena√ß√£o Nacional de Lutas (Conlutas, ). Conlutas represents between 30 and 40 percent of the CUT leadership, and it is closer to the United Socialist Workers' Party (PSTU) and the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) - dissidences of PT themselves - than PT.Greenleft.org The following year, leaders tied to PSOL and the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB) formed the Instrumento de Luta e Organiza√ß√£o da Classe Trabalhadora (Intersindical, )O PCB, a Intersindical e a cria√ß√£o de uma nova central sindical and, in 2007, leaders linked to the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB) formed the Central dos Trabalhadores e Trabalhadoras do Brasil (CTB, ).

It is a private resort leased to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., for the exclusive use of passengers of its three cruise lines: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Azamara Club Cruises, until 2050. Royal Caribbean has contributed the largest proportion of tourist revenue to Haiti since 1986, employing 300 locals, allowing another 200 to sell their wares on the premises for a fee and paying the Haitian government US$12 per tourist. The resort is completely tourist-oriented, and is guarded by a private security force. The site is fenced off from the surrounding area, and passengers are not allowed to leave the property. Food available to tourists is brought from the cruise ships. A controlled group of Haitian merchants are given sole rights to sell their merchandise and establish their businesses in the resort. Although sometimes described as an island in advertisements, it is actually a peninsula contiguous with the island of Hispaniola. The cruise ship moors to the pier at Labadee capable of servicing the Oasis class ships, which was completed in late 2009. The commercial airport that is closest to Labadee is Cap-Ha√Øtien International Airport. Attractions include a Haitian flea market, beaches, watersports, a water-oriented playground, an alpine coaster, and the largest zip-line over water.

It is a white solid with a strong honey-like odor. Endogeneously, it is a catabolite of phenylalanine. As a commercial chemical, because it can be used in the illicit production of phenylacetone (used in the manufacture of substituted amphetamines), it is subject to controls in countries including the United States and China. Names Synonyms include Œ±-toluic acid, benzeneacetic acid, alpha tolylic acid, 2-phenylacetic acid, and Œ≤-phenylacetic acid. Occurrence Phenylacetic acid has been found to be an active auxin (a type of plant hormone), found predominantly in fruits. However, its effect is much weaker than the effect of the basic auxin molecule indole-3-acetic acid. In addition the molecule is naturally produced by the metapleural gland of most ant species and used as an antimicrobial. It is also the oxidation product of phenethylamine in humans following metabolism by monoamine oxidase and subsequent metabolism of the intermediate product, phenylacetaldehyde, by the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme; these enzymes are also found in many other organisms. Preparation This compound may be prepared by the hydrolysis of benzyl cyanide: :300px 200px Applications Phenylacetic acid is used in some perfumes, as it possesses a honey-like odor even in low concentrations. It is also used in penicillin G production and diclofenac production. It is also employed to treat type II hyperammonemia to help reduce the amounts of ammonia in a patient's bloodstream by forming phenylacetyl-CoA, which then reacts with nitrogen-rich glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine. This compound is then excreted from the patient's body. It's also used in the illicit production of phenylacetone, which is used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. The sodium salt of phenylacetic acid, sodium phenylacetate, is used as a pharmaceteutical drug for the treatment of urea cycle disorders, including as the combination drug sodium phenylacetate/sodium benzoate (Ammonul). Phenylacetic acid is used in the preparation of several pharmaceutical drugs, including camylofin, bendazol, triafungin, phenacemide, lorcainide, phenindione, and cyclopentolate.

The coffee was introduced to Jamaica in 1728. The best lots of Blue Mountain coffee are noted for their mild flavour and lack of bitterness. Over the past few decades, this coffee has developed a reputation that has made it one of the most expensive and sought-after coffees in the world. Over 80% of all Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is exported to Japan. In addition to its use for brewed coffee, the beans are the flavour base of Tia Maria coffee liqueur. Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is a globally protected certification mark, meaning only coffee certified by the Jamaica Commodities Regulatory Authority (previously the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica) can be labelled as such. It comes from a recognised growing region in the Blue Mountain region of Jamaica, and its cultivation is monitored by the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica. The Blue Mountains are generally located between Kingston to the south and Port Antonio to the north. Rising to , they are some of the highest mountains in the Caribbean. The climate of the region is cool and misty with high rainfall. The soil is rich, with excellent drainage. This combination of climate and soil is considered ideal for coffee.\\"Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee: The History, 2020\\" Eighty Seven Plus Coffee The Coffee Industry Regulation Act The Coffee Industry Regulation Act specifies what coffee may use the Blue Mountain label. Additionally, it restricts the use of the Blue Mountain trademark to those authorized by the Jamaica Agricultural Commodities Regulatory Authority (formerly the Coffee Industry Board). Broadly speaking, coffee harvested from the parishes of Saint Andrew, Saint Thomas, Portland and Saint Mary may be considered Blue Mountain coffee. Traditionally, only coffee grown at elevations between and could be called Jamaica Blue Mountain. Coffee grown at elevations between and is called Jamaica High Mountain, and coffee grown below elevation is called Jamaica Supreme or Jamaica Low Mountain. (All land in Jamaica above is a forest preserve, so no coffee is grown there.) Classifications of Blue Mountain Coffee There are generally three types of grades of Jamaica Blue Mountain ranked by size and defects. Number 1 beans as the largest and most desired with least defects, followed by number 2 and 3 beans. Separately, there are peaberry beans which are smaller beans which appear shaped as a rugby ball as opposed to the usual flat beans.

He notably served as Comptroller of the Household between 1853 and 1856. Background Douglas was the son of John Douglas, 7th Marquess of Queensberry, by Sarah Douglas, daughter of Major James Sholto Douglas. He became known by the courtesy title Viscount Drumlanrig when his father succeeded to the marquessate of Queensberry in 1837.thepeerage.com Archibald William Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry Cricket He played first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1841. Political career Lord Drumlanrig was returned to parliament for Dumfriesshire in 1847. In early 1853 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Comptroller of the Household under Lord Aberdeen, a post he held until 1856, during the last year under the premiership of Lord Palmerston. In 1856 he also succeeded his father in the marquessate. However, as this was a Scottish peerage, it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. He stood down from the House of Commons in early 1857. Apart from his political career he was also Lord-Lieutenant of Dumfriesshire from 1850 to 1858. Family Lord Queensberry married Caroline Margaret Clayton (1821‚Äì1904), daughter of General Sir William Clayton, 5th Baronet, at Gretna Green, Scotland, in 1840. They had six children: * Lady Gertrude Georgiana Douglas (died 1893), married Thomas Stock. * John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry (1844‚Äì1900), the man behind the Marquess of Queensberry rules that formed the basis of modern boxing, and, much later, the downfall of author and playwright Oscar Wilde. * Lord Francis William Bouverie Douglas (1847‚Äì1865), beaten by A. W. Moore and party by a day to first ascent of the Ober Gabelhorn, killed a week later in the first successful ascent of the Matterhorn. * Reverend Lord Archibald Edward Douglas (1850‚Äì1938). * Lady Florence Caroline Douglas (1855‚Äì1905) (twin), war correspondent, travel writer, and feminist. * Lord James Edward Sholto Douglas (1855‚Äì1891) (twin), married racehorse breeder Martha Lucy Hennessy in 1888. James committed suicide in 1891 by cutting his throat with a razor in a London hotel. Lord Queensberry died while hunting in August 1858 aged forty, officially from the explosion of his gun. However, the event was widely believed to be a suicide. The Marchioness of Queensberry died in February 1904.

He is known for his leading role in the 1955 Australian film Jedda, which made him the first Indigenous Australian film star, and also his position as Vice-President of the Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights. The Tudawali Indigenous Film and Television Awards (Tudawali Awards) continue to recognise outstanding achievements of Indigenous people in the Australian film industry. Early life  Tudawali was born and raised on Melville Island in the Northern Territory to Tiwi parents. Although he had only a basic education in Kahlin Compound and Half Caste Home in Darwin, Tudawali gained a rich English vocabulary. He was the leading Australian rules footballer as a youth, and he alternated several times between Aboriginal and white society. He used the name Bobby Wilson in Darwin when he travelled there by canoe in the late 1930s, using the surname of his father's employer. He was an orderly with the Royal Australian Air Force, worked briefly in an army store and mechanical workshop, and also as a waiter before becoming an actor. Actor and activist Photo of actor Robert Tudawali, 1955 Tudawali became the first Indigenous Australian film star as a result of playing the lead role, Marbuck, in the 1955 Australian film Jedda. In 1958 he played the role of Emu Foot in Dust in the Sun, a mystery film adapted from the novel Justin Bayard by Jon Cleary and produced by the team of Lee Robinson and Chips Rafferty. Under the name Bobby Wilson, he took part in various episodes of the 1960 TV series Whiplash, and featured in the ABC television play, Burst of Summer, in 1961. Tudawali served as Vice-President of the Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights in 1966 and, working with activist Dexter Daniels, trade unionist and activist Brian Manning and author Frank Hardy, fought to highlight the poor wages and conditions of Aboriginal stockmen in the Northern Territory, which culminated in the Wave Hill walk-off in 1966.Snowdon, W., \\"‚ÄúSometime we bin get extra salt on the beef.‚Äù Heroes of the Northern Territory\\", Crikey, http://blogs.crikey.com.au/northern/2012/08/16/sometime- we-bin-get-extra-salt-on-the-beef-heroes-of-the-northern-territory/ Accessed 18 August 2012. Tudawali had organised to give a series of talks to unionists throughout Australia in support of the stockmen when the Northern Territory administration banned any travel by Tudawali due to the tuberculosis he was suffering at the time. Personal and later life Tudawali was married to Peggy Wogait in 1948 and they lived at the Bagot Aboriginal Reserve (where all of the residents of Kahlin had been moved in 1938); later he married a woman named Nancy. He died of tuberculosis and severe burns at Darwin Hospital on 26 July 1967, following an incident at Bagot; an argument had broken out when he refused to offer his 11-year-old daughter Christine for marriage. His funeral took place at Nightcliff, Northern Territory.

He has released two albums of aggressive electropop and has worked with Miss Kittin and Ellen Allien, and helped found the Shitkatapult record label. He is also partly responsible for the mid-2000s resurgence of the schaffel beat. Career In the early 1990s, Marco was the drummer for a hardcore punk group called Zorn, who performed more than 300 shows around Europe, and released two albums on Maximum Voice Records (Leipzig). In 1997, his rock band Stormbow released their debut record, the first on Shitkatapult. Marco founded this now-famous label with Marcus Stotz in Heidelberg. At the same time, Marco was also working on a project called shrubbn!!, based on noise improvisation, together with Ulli Bomans. In the same year, Marco got his solo moniker for electronic music: T.Raumschmiere. In 1998, Marco moved to Berlin. The first tracks under the name \\"T. Raumschmiere\\" were released on the compilation series Cozmick Suckers, also on Shitkatapult. Around this time, he began work on a stage project called Pop Poisoned Poetry featuring Miss Tigra, and started a monthly event called Erl√∂sung Durch Strom (salvation through electricity). In 2000, the first T. Raumschmiere records were released. These records gave him the title of King of Gnarz ( is a German expression for the sound of a record's endless loop). The first releases were based almost completely on samples of these sounds, tuned up or down to get bass or treble. He also started drumming again, with his punk rock band Mos Eisley Rock. In 2001, Raumschmiere played more than 150 live and DJ gigs all over the world. In 2002, Shitkatapult bundled together the best of T.Raumschmiere's Greatest Gnarz Hits on the Great Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Swindle. A little later, the album Anti was released by Hefty Records. Marco had also been working on new songs with his band Mos Eisley Rock, a few of which have appeared on different compilations. In 2003, T.Raumschmiere was listed as Best Live Act and Shitkatapult as Best Label in several Reader Poll Top 10s. He was offered a record deal on novamute. The first single to be released was \\"Monstertruckdriver\\" with \\"The Game Is Not Over\\" (featuring Miss Kittin). The debut album, Radio Blackout, followed. In 2004, more remixes followed, including one for his American friend Quasimodo Jones. After touring continuously since 2003, T.Raumschmiere tried something new. He enlisted drummer Dirk Mielenhausen and bass player Andreas Paruschke, along with sound engineer Allert Aalders, as his stage cover band for all live concerts and started to sing. The T.Raumschmiere band toured all over Europe, playing festivals in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Germany. In 2005, the brand new album Blitzkrieg Pop was released on novamute. After a hiatus, in October 2006, T.Raumschmiere released the track \\"Die alte Leier\\" that had been produced in 1996 in Heidelberg with Alex Cortex. After the 2005 album \\"Blitzkrieg Pop\\" and the 2006 release \\"Random Noize Sessions, Vol. 1\\", T.Raumschmiere is finally releasing his next album: \\"I Tank U\\" in 2008. In December 2009 T.

He played first-class cricket for Yorkshire from 1961 to 1981, and for Derbyshire from 1982 to 1984. Overseas, he was a successful captain of Tasmania in the period before the state was included in the Sheffield Shield. He was also appointed President of Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 2016, serving until his death. Cricket writer Colin Bateman remarked, \\"Hampshire thrilled English cricket supporters when he scored a century at Lord's on his Test debut ‚Äì a unique achievement for an England player. An attractive middle-order stroke- player, Hampshire looked one for the future but he was dropped after one more match\\". Early life Born on 10 February 1941 in Thurnscoe, Hampshire came from a cricketing family. His father, John, played for Yorkshire in 1937. His younger brother, Alan, also played for Yorkshire in 1975. Playing career Hampshire made his debut for his native Yorkshire at the age of 20 in 1961, where he had a twenty-year career with the club. Between 1969 and 1975 he played 8 Tests for England, scoring 403 runs. On his debut against the West Indies at Lord's, he made a dashing 107 and he appeared set for a glittering Test career. He was the first Englishman to score a Test hundred on debut at Lord's. Strangely, he was dropped after the next match, and faded away from the Test arena, making just half-a-dozen more Test appearances for England. After the ousting of Geoff Boycott from the Yorkshire captaincy, Hampshire captained the club for two seasons from 1979 to 1980. The two had previously clashed, and in the last season of Boycott's captaincy, Hampshire had staged a 'go-slow' at Northampton ‚Äì which cost Yorkshire a bonus point ‚Äì as a protest against slow batting by his long-time rival. He left Yorkshire in 1981 during one of the county's then almost perennial bouts of civil war, and during the winter played for a Leicestershire team as a guest in Zimbabwe. In 1982 he joined Derbyshire where he stayed for three years. Hampshire played for Tasmania for five years under the captaincy of Jack Simmons. He made his Sheffield Shield debut with Tasmania in their first season in 1977‚Äì78. He was a member of Tasmania's 1978‚Äì79 Gillette Cup-winning squad. Hampshire was a powerful stroke maker in the middle order, especially strong off the front foot. He scored 28,059 runs in 577 first-class matches at 34.55, including 43 centuries, with a highest score of 183 not out. He added another 7,314 runs in 280 one day matches with a best of 119 at 31.12. He was a brave close fielder who took 446 catches in his first-class career. He was seen as potentially useful leg spinner, taking 7 for 52 against Glamorgan in 1963.John Hampshire at Cricket Archive Umpiring career After retiring from the playing arena, Hampshire became a county umpire in 1985. He was then appointed to the Test list in 1989, and later in 1999 he was added to the ICC panel of umpires. Hampshire stood in his first Test match as an umpire at Old Trafford during the 1989 Ashes. He remained a highly respected umpire on the first-class circuit until his retirement in 2005. He stood in 21 Tests and 20 One-day Internationals. He umpired the final of the last Benson and Hedges Cup competition in 2002 with Barry Dudleston, thirty years after having played against Dudleston in the first final of that competition held in 1972.

The Genoa Economic and Financial Conference was a formal conclave of 34 nations held in Genoa, Italy from 10 April to 19 May 1922. It was planned by British prime minister David Lloyd George to resolve the major economic and political issues facing Europe, and to deal with the pariah states of Germany and Russia, both of which had been excluded from the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. The conference was particularly interested in developing a strategy to rebuild a defeated Germany, as well as central and eastern European states, and to negotiate a relationship between European capitalist economies and the new Bolshevik regime in Soviet Russia. However, Russia and Germany signed a separate agreement at Rapallo and the result at Genoa was a fiasco with few positive results. The conference did come up with a proposal for resuming the gold standard that was largely put in place by major countries.Kenneth O. Morgan, Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918-1922 (1986) pp 310-16. Background British prime minister David Lloyd George (1863-1945) designed the 1922 Conference in Genoa, Italy. The idea for a general economic and financial conference of European nations had roots in a January 1922 session of the Supreme War Council held in Cannes.John Saxon Mills, The Genoa Conference. London: Hutchinson & Co., 1922; pg. 9. With Europe facing an economic catastrophe brought about by half a decade of World War, marked by millions of deaths, shattered infrastructure, and vast sums of squandered economic resources, British prime minister David Lloyd George sought an authoritative international gathering to set Europe's political and financial house in order, and to firmly establish his leadership at home.Mills, The Genoa Conference, pp. 9-10. The formal proposal was made at Cannes on 6 January 1922 in the form of a draft resolution presented by Lloyd George and approved unanimously that same day calling for such a conference.Mills, The Genoa Conference, pg. 11. Lloyd George told his parliament that the primary intent of the conference was to provide for \\"reconstruction of economic Europe, devastated and broken into fragments by the desolating agency of war.David Lloyd George, Speech to Commons of 3 April 1922, quoted in Mills, The Genoa Conference, pg. 10. The economy of Europe was at the point of collapse, Lloyd George noted: > \\"If European countries had gathered together their mobile wealth accumulated > by centuries of industry and thrift on to one pyramid and then set fire to > it, the result could hardly have been more complete. International trade has > been disorganized through and through. The recognized medium of commerce, > exchange based upon currency, has become almost worthless and unworkable; > vast areas, upon which Europe has hitherto depended for a large proportion > of its food supplies and its raw material, completely destroyed for all > purposes of commerce; nations, instead of cooperating to restore, broken up > by suspicions and creating difficulties and new artificial restrictions; > great armies ready to march, and nations already overburdened with taxation > having to bear the additional taxation which the maintenance of these huge > armaments to avoid suspected dangers renders necessary.\\" Lloyd George controversially sought the inclusion of Germany and Soviet Russia to the international conference as equal members, which met with the particular opposition of France, which sought to neutralize and isolate the two pariah nations of Europe by including them only in an inferior capacity.Mills, The Genoa Conference, pp. 21-22. Any softening in the hardline stance towards Germany was perceived by France as a weakening of the Treaty of Versailles, of which it was a prime beneficiary and to which it was immutably committed.Mills, The Genoa Conference, pg. 25. Reparations and recognition French Prime Minister Aristide Briand (1862-1932), whose government fell shortly before convocation of the Genoa Conference. Two great issues lay as impediments to convocation of a multilateral convention to plan the economic reconstruction of Europe. One was the issue of reparations, regarded as the primary matter of contention between the Triple Entente powers of France and Great Britain in the postwar era.Sally Marks, \\"Reparations in 1922,\\" in Carole Fink, Axel Frohn, and J√ºrgen Heideking (eds.), Genoa, Rapallo, and European Reconstruction in 1922. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1991; pg. 66. At issue was whether the terms of economic reparations in the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, were to be enforced or amended. On the one hand was the British view that massive reconstruction costs laid upon Germany would undermine European economic recovery and thereby the market for British exports of manufactured goods. The French, on the other hand, believed that if Germany were allowed to skirt the severe financial obligations detailed in the peace treaty, its economic rise would be massively accelerated and its political and military hegemony on the European continent rapidly restored. France, among the main battlegrounds of the European conflagration, was particularly hard-hit and in need of external funds for reconstruction; Germany, on the other hand, was seen as having largely escaped the destruction of infrastructure and economic capacity during the war and currently engaged in systematic underestimation of their ability to pay.Marks, \\"Reparations in 1922,\\" pp. 66-67. The political and economic weakness of Germany was emphasized by its new Weimar government, which effectively made the argument that it would be unable to maintain the specified payment schedule.Marks, \\"Reparations in 1922,\\" pg. 67. Germany's position came to be regarded as an axiomatic truth by political decision-makers in London and Washington, DC, as well as elsewhere throughout, despite quiet indications from some German authorities themselves that some substantial portion of the reparations bill could be safely managed. German politicians sought to minimize the country's tax burden through the acquisition of foreign loans and the reduction of the overall reparations bill.Marks, \\"Reparations in 1922,\\" pp. 67-68. British, American, and Swiss bankers were for their own part adamant that necessary loans would not be available until a final, achievable reparations bill and repayment schedule could be agreed upon by all main parties in the dispute.Marks, \\"Reparations in 1922,\\" pg. 68. In the meantime, German authorities attempted to raise the foreign currency necessary for reparations by dumping paper currency unbacked by gold on the market, triggering a hyperinflation paralyzing the country's economy, which had a desired subsidiary effect of helping make the case that the current schedule of reparations was untenable. It was hoped by Germany, Britain, and the United States and feared by France that the Genoa Conference would provide an opportunity for downward revision of the reparations schedule set forth by treaty.Manfred Berg, \\"Germany and the United States: The Concept of World Economic Interdependence,\\" in Carole Fink, Axel Frohn, and J√ºrgen Heideking (eds.), Genoa, Rapallo, and European Reconstruction in 1922. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1991; pg. 82. The apparent softening the economic terms of the peace, which had taken place at Cannes, had led to the toppling of the government of the prime minister of France, Aristide Briand and left his successor, Raymond Poincar√©, with little appetite for participation, which threatened the conference.Mills, The Genoa Conference, pp. 25-26. It was only through a dedicated diplomatic offensive by Lloyd George towards the French government during February 1922 that its participation at the April conference, under terms previously agreed to by the Briand government, was won.Mills, The Genoa Conference, pg. 29. Although antagonism between France and Britain had festered in the months immediately after the war, France found itself in the uncomfortable position of having to submit to British desires on the matter of an economic conference, as without its support, France would have had little chance of collecting reparations from Germany or entering into any potential strategic military alliance.Carole Fink, The Genoa Conference: European Diplomacy, 1921-1922. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1984; pg. 32. The second potential hurdle to holding the Genoa Conference surrounded participation of the new Bolshevik- led government of Russia, as the United States and most nations of Europe did not maintain formal diplomatic relations with the regime and harbored economic claims against it. This inconvenient situation had been effectively set aside by the Supreme Council itself, which approved a formal resolution at its meeting of 10 January 1922 that invited Soviet participation and calling upon the Bolsheviks to submit a list of delegates and support staff seeking to attend so that safe conduct passes for travel and accommodation could be arranged.\\"Invitation to Russia,\\" part of Appendix I, reprinted in Mills, The Genoa Conference, pg. 315. Opening Interior view of the main hall of the Palazzo di San Giorgio, location of plenary meetings of the Genoa Conference of 1922. The opening ceremony of the Genoa Conference took place at 3 pm on 10 April 1922 at the Palazzo di San Giorgio, one of the oldest palaces in the city.Mills, The Genoa Conference, pg. 45. Delegations entered at one end of the palace, running a gauntlet of news photographers from around the world, while at the opposite end guests, journalists and members of delegation support staffs disembarked from a column of automobiles to go inside the building.Mills, The Genoa Conference, pg. 46. Admission to journalists was through tickets distributed ahead of the event, which were strictly limited. The entrance of Lloyd George was met with a great ovation from those assembled in the hall as he took his seat to the left of the chairman's seat at the front of the room. As the chief architect of the gathering, he would effectively dominate public sessions of the Conference. Return to gold standard Among the propositions formulated at the conference was the proposal that central banks make a partial return to the gold standard, which had been dropped to print money to pay for the war. Central banks wanted a return to a gold-based economy to ease international trade and facilitating economic stability, but they wanted a gold standard that \\"conserved\\" gold stocks, with the gold remaining in the vaults and day-to-day transactions being conducted with representative paper notes. The partial return to the gold standard was done by permitting central banks to keep part of their reserves in currencies, which were themselves directly exchangeable for gold coins. However, citizens would not receive gold coins of the realm in exchange for their notes, unlike the prewar gold standard. Citizens of European countries had to redeem their banknotes in large gold bars, unsuitable for day-to-day transactions. That largely achieved the goal of keeping the gold in the vaults. Treaty of Rapallo On 16 April 1922 on the sidelines of the Genoa Conference, the RSFSR and Germany signed the Treaty of Rapallo. Ratifications were exchanged in Berlin on 31 January 1923. The treaty did not include secret military provisions; however secret military cooperation soon followed.Gordon H.

Results With the Treaty of Rapallo pulling Russia and Germany out of the main picture, the conference lapsed into stalemate. The major powers at first agreed on a contingency package of financial aid to Russia, but the Allies could not agree on the final plan and nothing was offered. The issue of German reparations went nowhere after Poincar√© threatened to invade Germany on a unilateral basis if Berlin defaulted on its next round of payments. Lloyd George was increasingly undercut by heavy attacks from the London newspapers. Nevertheless, he offered a final series of linked proposals, which would reduce Germany's liabilities for reparations, increase the French share of payments, and float an international loan to finance German payments, with the money from the loan going directly to France. But nothing was approved. Germany was expelled, France and Belgium withdrew, and the final draft communiqu√© to Russia was signed only by Britain, Italy, Japan, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, and Sweden, leaving out the key world powers except for Britain itself. Russia in turn rejected this final document. The last decision was to set up another conference at The Hague to take up the same issues. British historian Kenneth O. Morgan concludes: : Genoa was a watershed in international diplomacy.... Never again would such a large, rambling assembly, on the lines of Paris in 1919, be convened, until San Francisco in 1945.... There was too little detailed preparation, too much generalized optimism, too many disparate issues muddled up with one another. In many ways, it was a parody of summit diplomacy at its worst.Morgan, Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918-1922 (1986) p, 314, quote on p. 315.

At this time, Radulf, Duke of Thuringia, rebelled against Sigebert III, king of Austrasia. Grimoald participated in the ensuing expedition against the insurrection, but it was a failure.

Fluvial processes in the cirque The area is an example of a dissected plateau in which the Vis River eroded a deep channel through the base of the valley, creating an incised meander which eventually eroded through creating a cut-off at the neck of the loop.Official website: landscapes This left an oxbow lake which later dried up, leaving deposits of silt and peat. This created what is the only patch of arable land for many miles around. Road network Roads within the cirque and around the central peak Roads in the area are very poorly maintained and are only wide enough for one vehicle.

The line is long, and serves all 13 SEPTA Regional Rail lines. Current service 200px Service on the Main Line segment between Glenside and Center City is given a special combined public timetable known as the Glenside Combined, allowing riders to see the schedules of all trains on the Main Line without having to look at multiple schedules. This is a partial legacy of the former SEPTA route number designations, which had the R1 Glenside designation for trains that turned at the station, paired with the Airport Line. That few trains actually terminated there and instead continued on to stations farther out was a contributing factor to the elimination of the route designators. , most northbound trains on the Main Line continue as Lansdale/Doylestown Line, Warminster Line, or West Trenton Line trains. Those that do not terminate at Glenside. History The Main Line was mostly built by the North Pennsylvania Railroad. However, the oldest section was part of the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad (PG&N;), the first railroad in Philadelphia. The first section of it opened on June 7, 1832, from downtown to Germantown (now on the Chestnut Hill East Line). Later a new alignment was built to Norristown, leaving the old route from North Philadelphia to Germantown as a branch; this is now the Manayunk/Norristown Line. The PG&N; south of Wayne Junction, the Ninth Street Branch, is now part of the Main Line. The North Pennsylvania Railroad (North Penn) opened south of Gwynedd (north of Glenside) on July 2, 1855, and the continuation to Lansdale (including the branch to Doylestown, now the Lansdale/Doylestown Line) opened October 7. The short part of the Main Line from Wayne Junction northeast to north of Newtown Junction was built as a connection to the PG&N; at Wayne Junction. On December 1, 1870, the Philadelphia and Reading Railway (later the Reading Company) leased the PG&N.; The North Penn was leased May 1, 1879, placing the future \\"Reading side\\" of the SEPTA Main Line under Reading control. Electrification to Glenside, Hatboro, Lansdale, Doylestown and West Trenton was completed on July 26, 1931. In 1976 Conrail took over the Reading, and in 1983 SEPTA gained control of the commuter operations. The Center City Commuter Connection was tied into the former Reading main line on November 12, 1984, completing the SEPTA Main Line as it is defined today. SEPTA activated positive train control on the Main Line from Glenside to Fern Rock on December 12, 2016 and from Fern Rock to 30th Street on January 9, 2017. Other uses The term \\"Main Line\\" is also sometimes used on the SEPTA Regional Rail system to refer to the Paoli/Thorndale Line, which runs along the original main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which is now Amtrak's Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line.

Though there is considerable variety in the design, the most common sex swings have a support for the back, another for the buttocks, and stirrups for each leg, which can be adjusted whilst the user is suspended. Description Hammock-style sling for sexual activity A sex swing or sling is designed to assist in sexual activity. Materials for constructing these devices include nylon webbing, heavy canvas, leather, neoprene, heavy rubber, wood, and steel. The designs provide access to the passive (receptive) partner's genitalia, perineum, buttocks, and anal areas while supporting the individual in a comfortable position, with the hips flexed, to allowing the passive partner to fully relax. Types of swings There are many variations of swings that can be broken down to four basic types: sex slings, sex swings, door sex swings and body sex swings. Sex slings are a category of sex swings that include a large panel to support the entire body. These can generally be constructed from leather, fabric or wood. Sex slings can range from 1 to 5 mounting points depending on design with 4 points being the most common. A sex sling has more limited number of position options than some other swing styles. Subcategories include traditional sex slings and platform sex slings. Traditional sex swings are composed of 2 primary straps and stirrups. Additional options such as handles and headrests are available. There are many installation options including ceiling hooks, stands and between the walls in a hallway. The traditional sex swing has the largest number of position options available. Subcategories include pinning swings, bondage swings, single hook swings, and dual hook swings. Door sex swings are a type of sling that installs over a door. It is secured in place by the door frame. Door swings have a limited range or positions options but are favored because of the quick installation. Standard door swings include leg straps and optionally handles. Deluxe door swings add an additional seat strap. Subcategories include standard door swings and deluxe door swings. Body sex swings are a harness that worn on the body with handles and leg straps to support another person to facilitate standing sex positions.  Purpose  The main purpose of sex swings is to make sexual intercourse more exciting and effortless. A sex swing may enable greater freedom of movement during intercourse or assist with challenging sex positions. Swings may also be used by couples who are into BDSM, since it acts like bondage where the partner in the swing has very little to no control. Swings may be used for vaginal and anal sex, fellatio, and cunnilingus. Sex swings can enable individuals with a physical impairment or disability to enjoy a wide range of sexual activities. Individuals with muscular weakness or arthritis may use a sex swing to reduce the strain on affected muscles or joints. Individuals who use a wheelchair can engage in sexual activity using a sex swing suspended from a hoist. Note: This source is judged unreliable, as it states Wikipedia as a source.  Safety  It is important to follow the provided instructions when using a sex swing. Secure mounting is vital to avoid injury to the suspended partner from falling. The use of toggle bolts, such as would be used to hang a dreamcatcher, is not appropriate. Installing springs, if supplied, is important to reduce physical shock to the suspended partner caused by rapid deceleration when bouncing in a sex swing.

Much of the code was then reworked to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and to improve security, and the product was reintroduced as OpenEMR version 1.3 a year later, in July 2002. On OpenEMR was released to the public under the GNU General Public License (GPL), i.e. it became a free and open-source project and was registered on SourceForge. The project evolved through version 2.0 and the Pennington Firm (Pennfirm) took over as its primary maintainer in 2003. Walt Pennington transferred the OpenEMR software repository to SourceForge in March 2005. Mr. Pennington also established Rod Roark, Andres Paglayan and James Perry, Jr. as administrators of the project. Walt Pennington, Andres Paglayan and James Perry eventually took other directions and were replaced by Brady Miller in August 2009. Robert Down became an administrator of the project in March 2017.

The book is designed to make the stories of Shakespeare's plays familiar to the young. Mary Lamb was responsible for the comedies, while Charles wrote the tragedies; they wrote the preface between them. Marina Warner, in her introduction to the Penguin 2007 edition, says that Mary did not get her name on the title page till the seventh edition in 1838. Publication history Tales from Shakespeare has been republished many times. It was first published by the Juvenile Library of William Godwin (under the alias Thomas Hodgkins) and his second wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, who chose the illustrations, probably by William MulreadyWilliam Mulready, from The Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 39.. Later illustrators included Sir John Gilbert in 1866, Arthur Rackham in 1899 and 1909,Norman Wright and David Ashford, Masters of Fun and Thrills: The British Comic Artists Vol. 1, Norman Wright (pub.), 2008, p. 65 Louis Monzi√®s in 1908,Published by Boston : D. C. Heath & Co., 1908 Walter Paget in 1910, and D. C. Eyles in 1934. In 1893-4, the book was supplemented with some additional tales by Harrison S. Morris, and was re- published in the USA as a multi-volume set with colour plate illustrations. As noted in the authors' preface, \\"[Shakespeare's] words are used whenever it seemed possible to bring them in; and in whatever has been added to give them the regular form of a connected story, diligent care has been taken to select such words as might least interrupt the effect of the beautiful English tongue in which he wrote: therefore, words introduced into our language since his time have been as far as possible avoided.\\" Contents The book contains the following tales: # The Tempest (Mary Lamb) # A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mary Lamb) # The Winter's Tale (Mary Lamb) # Much Ado About Nothing (Mary Lamb) # As You Like It (Mary Lamb) # Two Gentlemen of Verona (Mary Lamb) # The Merchant of Venice (Mary Lamb) # Cymbeline (Mary Lamb) # King Lear (Charles Lamb) # Macbeth (Charles Lamb) # All's Well That Ends Well (Mary Lamb) # The Taming of the Shrew (Mary Lamb) # The Comedy of Errors (Mary Lamb) # Measure for Measure (Mary Lamb) # Twelfth Night (Mary Lamb) # Timon of Athens (Charles Lamb) # Romeo and Juliet (Charles Lamb) # Hamlet, Prince of Denmark (Charles Lamb) # Othello (Charles Lamb) # Pericles, Prince of Tyre (Mary Lamb)  In fiction  The book is given as a gift in Morley's \\"Parnassus on Wheels\\".

Created in 1964, the Teton Wilderness is located within Bridger-Teton National Forest and consists of 585,238 acres (2,370 km2). The wilderness is bordered on the north by Yellowstone National Park and to the west by Grand Teton National Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. The Washakie Wilderness is to the east and the remainder of Bridger-Teton National Forest is to the south. The Teton Wilderness is a part of the 20 million acre (81,000 km2) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Among many other features, Teton Wilderness is notable for having the most remote location (farthest from any road) of any place in the contiguous 48 states of the US. This location occurs very close to Bridger Lake, near the confluence of the Thorofare and Yellowstone Rivers, not far from the USFS Hawk's Rest Ranger Station. U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness areas within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season. With the Continental Divide running through the wilderness, altitudes tend to be lofty with Younts Peak (12,165 ft./3708 m) being the highest point. One of the most interesting hydrological features in North America occurs at the Continental Divide at Two Ocean Pass within the Teton Wilderness. This wide, gentle, marshy pass separates the headwaters of Pacific Creek, which flows Westerly to the Pacific Ocean via the Snake and Columbia Rivers, and Atlantic Creek, which flows Easterly to the Atlantic Ocean via the Yellowstone, Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. At Two Ocean Pass, exactly on the Continental Divide, North Two Ocean Creek flows down from its drainage on the side of Two Ocean Plateau and divides its waters between Pacific Creek and Atlantic Creek. This spot is known as Parting of the Waters, and occurs at 44¬∞ 02.576'N, 110¬∞ 10.497'W. At this exact spot, water actually covers the Continental Divide such that a fish could safely swim from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean drainages. The Teton Wilderness has 450 miles (725 km) of hiking trails, all of which pass through prime grizzly bear habitat. Black bear, wolverine, cougar, moose, elk, mule deer, pronghorn, bison, bighorn sheep and the elusive wolf packs are all found here. At least 75 other mammal species exist in the wilderness including beaver, coyote, bobcat, mink, porcupine, river otter, marmot and pika. Both bald and golden eagles as well as falcons, owls, osprey, sandhill crane and geese are just a few of the 300 different species of birds in the wilderness. 30 different species of fish are known to exist as well including several varieties of cutthroat trout. The forest has hundreds of species of trees and plant life such as lodgepole pine, whitebark pine and varieties of spruce and fir. Sagebrush and willows are found in the open fields and along streams. This wilderness is infrequently visited in some areas, borders on the most remote section of Yellowstone National Park and has only a few limited access points along the southern and western border. Weather can be a factor in the wilderness with infrequent but severe thunderstorms in the spring and early summer. In 1987, a very rare high altitude tornado, called the Teton‚ÄìYellowstone tornado, destroyed an area of 20 miles (32 km) long and 2 miles (3.2 km) wide. The following year, almost half the forested sections of the wilderness were greatly impacted by the Yellowstone fires of 1988. These fires enhanced the wilderness ecosystem by reducing the amount of dead and down wood, helping lodgepole pine cones to germinate and improving grazing opportunities for such animals as elk and mule deer.

Xionites, Chionites, or Chionitae (Middle Persian: Xiy≈çn or Hiy≈çn; Avestan: Xiiaona; Sogdian xwn; Pahlavi Xyon) are Romanisations of the ethnonym of a nomadic people who were prominent in Transoxania and Bactria. The Xionites appear to be synonymous with the Huna peoples of classical/medieval India,Hyun Jin Kim, 2013, The Huns, Rome and the Birth of Europe, Cambridge UK/New York, Cambridge University Press, pp. 5, 36‚Äì38. and possibly also the Huns of European late antiquity. It is unclear whether the Xionites were connected to a people named in Ancient China as the Xunyu (H√ºny√º ÁçØÈ¨ª; Wade‚ÄìGiles Hs√ºny√º), Xianyun ÁåÉÁãÅ (Wade‚ÄìGiles Hsien-y√ºn) and Xiongnu (ÂåàÂ•¥ Wade‚ÄìGiles Hsiung-nu). (While some sources use names such as Hunas, Huns and Xiongnu interchangeably, this remains controversial.) They were first described by the Roman historian, Ammianus Marcellinus, who was in Bactria during 356-57 CE; he described the Chionit√¶ as living with the Kushans.Original reports on the \\"Chionitae\\" by Ammianus Marcellinus: Mention with the Euseni/ Cuseni : 16.9.4. Mention with the Gelani: 17.5.1. Mention with Shapur II: 18.7.21 Mention at the siege of Amida: 19.2.3 and 19.1.7-19.2.1 Ammianus indicates that the Xionites had previously lived in Transoxiana and, after entering Bactria, became vassals of the Kushans, were influenced culturally by them and had adopted the Bactrian language. They had attacked the Sassanid Empire, but later (led by a chief named Grumbates), served as mercenaries in the Sassanian army. Within the Xionites, there seem to have been two main subgroups, which were known in the Iranian languages by names such as Karmir Xyon and Spet Xyon. The prefixes karmir (\\"red\\") and speta (\\"white\\") likely refer to Central Asian traditions in which particular colours symbolised the cardinal points. The Karmir Xyon were known in European sources as the Kermichiones or \\"Red Huns\\", and some scholars have identified them with the Kidarites and/or Alchon. The Spet Xyon or \\"White Huns\\" appear to have been the known in India by the cognate name Sveta-huna, and are often identified, controversially, with the Hephtalites.  Origins and culture  Hephthalite horseman on British Museum bowl, 460-479 CE.British Museum notice The original culture of the Xionites and their geographical urheimat are uncertain. They appear to have originally followed animist religious beliefs, which mixed later with varieties of Buddhism and Shaivism. It is difficult to determine their ethnic composition. Differences between the Xionites, the Huns who invaded Europe in the 4th century, and the Turks were emphasised by Carlile Aylmer Macartney (1944), who suggested that the name \\"Chyon\\", originally that of an unrelated people, was \\"transferred later to the Huns owing to the similarity of sound\\". The Chyon who appeared in the 4th century, in the steppes on the northeastern frontier of Persia were probably a branch of the Huns that appeared shortly afterwards in Europe. The Huns appear to have attacked and conquered the Alans, then living between the Urals and the Volga about 360 AD, and the first mention of the Chyon was in 356 AD. At least some Turkic tribes were involved in the formation of the Xionites, despite their later character as an Eastern Iranian people, according to Richard Nelson Frye (1991): \\"Just as later nomadic empires were confederations of many peoples, we may tentatively propose that the ruling groups of these invaders were, or at least included, Turkic-speaking tribesmen from the east and north, although most probably the bulk of the people in the confederation of Chionites... spoke an Iranian language.... This was the last time in the history of Central Asia that Iranian-speaking nomads played any role; hereafter all nomads would speak Turkic languages\\".Richard Nelson Frye, \\"Pre-Islamic and early Islamic cultures in Central Asia\\" in \\"Turko-Persia in historical perspective\\", edited by Robert L. Canfield, Cambridge University Press, 1991. pg 49. The proposition that the Xionites probably originated as an Iranian tribe was put forward by Wolfgang Felix in Encyclopedia Iranica (1992). In 2005, As-Shahbazi suggested that they were originally a Hunnish people who had mixed with Iranian tribes in Transoxiana and Bactria, where they adopted the Kushan-Bactrian language. Likewise, Peter B. Golden that the Chionite confederation included earlier Iranian nomads as well as Proto-Mongolic and Turkic elements.  History  The defeat of the Xiongnu in 89 CE by Chinese forces at the Battle of Ikh Bayan and subsequent Chinese campaigns against them, led by Ban Chao may have been a factor in the ethnogenesis of the Xionites and their migration into Central Asia. Xionite tribes reportedly organised themselves into four main hordes: \\"Black\\" or northern (beyond the Jaxartes), \\"Blue\\" or eastern (in Tianshan), \\"White\\" or western (possibly the Hephthalites), around Khiva, and the \\"Red\\" or southern (Kidarites and/or Alchon), south of the Oxus. Artefacts found from the area they inhabited dating from their period indicate their totem animal seems to have been the (rein)deer. The Xionites are best documented in southern Central Asia from the late 4th century AD until the mid-5th century AD. = Kidarites = Portrait of Kidarites king Kidara, circa 350-386 AD.CNG Coins Sometime between 194 and 214, according to the Armenian historian Moses of Khorene (5th century), Hunni (probably the Kidarites) captured the city of Balkh (Armenian name: Kush) .Chinese According to Armenian sources, Balkh became the capital of the Hunni. At the end of the 4th century AD, the Kidarites were pushed into Gandhara, after a new wave of invaders from the north, the Alchon, entered Bactria.Nomads of the Steppe = Clashes with the Sasanians = Early confrontations between the Sasanian Empire of Shapur II with the Xionites were described by Ammianus Marcellinus: he reports that in 356 CE, Shapur II was taking his winter quarters on his eastern borders, \\"repelling the hostilities of the bordering tribes\\" of the Xionites and the Euseni, a name often amended to Cuseni (meaning the Kushans).Ammianus Marcellinus, Roman History. London: Bohn (1862) XVI-IX Shapur made a treaty of alliance with the Chionites and the Gelani in 358 CE.Ammianus Marcellinus, Roman History. London: Bohn (1862) XVII-V = Alchon = Artificial cranial deformation is suggested by a portrait of Khingila, king of the Alchon c. 430 - 490 AD.The Cambridge Companion to the Age of Attila, Michael Maas p.286 In 460, Khingila I reportedly united a Hephthalite ruling √©lite with elements of the Uar and Xionites as Alchon (or Alœáon). when. At the end of the 5th century the Alchon invaded North India where they were known as the Huna. In India the Alchon were not distinguished from their immediate Hephthalite predecessors, and both are known as Sveta-Hunas there. Perhaps complimenting this term, Procopius (527-565) wrote that they were white skinned, had an organized kingship, and that their life was not wild/nomadic and they lived in cities. The Alchon were noted for their distinctive coins, minted in Bactria in the 5th and 6th centuries. The name Khigi, inscribed in Bactrian script on one of the coins, and Narendra on another, have led some scholars to believe that the Hephthalite kings Khingila and Narana were of the AlChoNo tribe. They imitated the earlier style of their Hephthalite predecessors, the Kidarite Hun successors to the Kushans. In particular the Alchon style imitates the coins of Kidarite Varhran I (syn. Kushan Varhran IV). The earliest coins of the Alchon have several distinctive features: 1) the king's head is presented in an elongated form to reflect the Alchon practice of head binding; 2) The characteristic bull/lunar tamgha of the Alchon is represented on the obverse of the coins.Notes on the Evolution of Alchon Coins, Pankaj Tandon, http://coinindia.com/Alchon.pdf =Hephthalites= The Hephthalites, or White Huns, were a nomadic tribe who conquered large parts of the eastern middle-east and may have originally been part of the Xionites. =Nezak= Portrait of a Nezak ruler, circa 460-560 CE. Although the power of the Huna in Bactria was shattered in the 560s by a combination of Sassanid and proto-Turkic forces, the last Hephthalite king Narana/Narendra managed to maintain some kind of rule between 570 and 600 AD over the nspk, napki or Nezak tribes that remained. = Identity of the Karmir Xyon and White Xyon = Bailey argues that the Pahlavi name Xyon may be read as the Indian Huna owing to the similarity of sound.Bailey, H. W. Iranian Studies, Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London. BSOAS, vol. 6, No. 4 (1932) In the Avestan tradition (Yts. 9.30-31, 19.87) the Xiiaona were characterized as enemies of Vishtaspa, the patron of Zoroaster. In the later Pahlavi tradition, the Karmir Xyon (\\"Red Xyon\\") and Spet Xyon (\\"White Xyon\\") are mentioned. The Red Xyon of the Pahlavi tradition (7th century)\\"BAHMAN YA≈†T\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Iranica by W. Sundermann have been identified by Bailey as the Kermichiones or Ermechiones. According to Bailey, the Hara Huna of Indian sources are to be identified with the Karmir Xyon of the Avesta.(Bailey, 1954, pp.12-16; 1932, p. 945), Similarly he identifies the Sveta Huna of Indian sources with the Spet Xyon of the Avesta. While the Hephthalite are not mentioned in Indian sources, they are sometimes also linked to the Spet Xyon (and therefore possibly to the Sveta Huna). More controversially, the names Karmir Xyon and Spet Xyon are often rendered as \\"Red Huns\\" and \\"White Huns\\", reflecting speculation that the Xyon were linked to Huns recorded simultaneously in Europe.

History  F√•vang Stave Church is built of wood and was first constructed ca. 1300. During the period 1627‚Äì1630, F√•vang church was rebuilt and extended with parts of the material from an 11th- century stave church within the valley of Gudbrandsdal. Consequently, the oldest parts can date back to about 1150‚Äì1250. By tradition the reconstruction was supervised by master-builder Werner Olsen (ca. 1600‚Äì1682), who was also responsible for reconstruction of Ringebu Stave Church and Lom Stave Church. The church has a number of historic furnishings. Among other things the church has votives from 1684‚Äì1694. The altar and pulpit are of Renaissance style, both dated to the 17th century. A painting of the Christ Child is from 1732. The church has been through several reconstructions. It was restored during the period 1949 to 1951 under the direction of architect Jens Gram Dunker. The church was re-consecrated on 9 September 1951. Because it has been so extensively modified, it is often not counted among Norwegian stave churches.

In Europe, any shopping center with mostly \\"retail warehouse units\\" (UK terminology; in the US the term is \\"big-box stores\\"/superstores), 5000 sqm or larger is a retail park, according to the leading real estate company Cushman & Wakefield.\\"DEVELOPMENT OF RETAIL PARKS ACCELERATES THROUGHOUT EUROPE\\", Across: the European Placemaking Magazine, August 23, 2016 Positioning Retail parks generally are located in highly accessible locations and are aimed at households owning a car, though there are often also bus services. They are an alternative to city centre shopping districts. Such developments have been encouraged by cheaper, more affordable land on the outskirts of towns and cities, and with loose planning controls in a number of Enterprise Zones, making planning and development very easy. In recent years, in many areas across the UK, planning controls have been tightened to preserve the countryside. This has made it more difficult for such developments to proceed, resulting in many smaller, more compact retail parks, sometimes consisting of only three or four stores being built on former brownfield sites. There are also environmental disadvantages to large retail parks on the rural fringe, including the increased traffic and pollution that occurs during access. Typical tenants Typically retail parks host a range of chain stores, including furniture, clothes or footwear superstores, electrical stores, carpet and others - and the anchor tenant is usually a supermarket. Owing to their out-of-town sites, abundance of free parking and proximity to major roads, retail parks are often easier to reach than central shopping areas, and as a result town centres are less attractive to retailers. In Continental Europe Retail parks have been growing in Continental Europe: according to Cushman & Wakefield, who defines a retail park as an open-air centre with more than 5,000 sq. m. of retail space, total retail space in retail parks in Europe was predicted to be around 40 million sq. m. at the end of 2017. The amount of floor space in retail parks increased by 836,000 square meters in 2015, and 1.3 million square metres in 2016.

The Constitution empowered Parliament to create other courts; these were to be subordinate to the High Court, which was authorized to oversee all proceedings of such courts. The High Court had unlimited original jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil or criminal proceedings under any law and such other original jurisdiction as is conferred on it under the Constitution. The High Court consists of the Chief Justice and at least ten (and no more than eighteen\\"High Court Act to be amended\\", Fiji Times, July 4, 2007\\"High Court promulgation 2007\\" , Fiji government press release, July 17, 2007) puisne judges. Parliament may also allow for junior judges, called Masters of the High Court, to sit on the High Court. Section 129 of the Constitution declares that \\"A judge who has sat in a trial of a matter that is the subject of appeal to a higher court must not sit in the appeal.\\" As the membership of the High Court overlaps to a large extent with that of the Appeal Court and the Supreme Court, this clause is inserted to prevent a conflict of interest. Until July 2007, under the High Court Act, foreign judges appointed to the High Court had to be nationals of one of the following countries: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Sri Lanka, Tonga, or the United Kingdom. In practice, appointees were almost exclusively nationals of Australia and New Zealand. In July 2007, President Ratu Josefa Iloilovatu Uluivuda issued the High Court Act (Amendment) Promulgation, which extended the list to \\"any country which is at the time of the appointment a member of the Commonwealth of nations\\". The Promulgation particularly highlighted Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and India as potential sources for the appointment of new judges. Hong Kong was specifically cited as an authorised source for judges despite not being a member of the Commonwealth.

Early life L√°szl√≥ was born in the Kingdom of Hungary and raised in Budapest. He studied skin pathology and skin disease at the Royal Hungarian Elisabeth University of Medical Sciences in Budapest, and completed his clinical studies in Berlin, Germany, under Max Joseph. In 1927, L√°szl√≥ opened his first institute in Budapest with his brother, William Laszlo, the dr. Med. L√°szl√≥ Institute for Scientific Cosmetology. He achieved fame when he created a special foundation cream for Princess St√©phanie of Belgium who lost her self- confidence due to an acute case of acne. His reputation was further solidified after he treated actress Frida Gombaszoegi's facial scars after being shot in the face by a man she rejected. Soon, women from all ranks of society wanted to see L√°szl√≥ for skin and make-up advice. The Ern≈ë L√°szl√≥ Institute In 1939, at the onset of World War II, L√°szl√≥ moved to New York. On 3 November 1939, the New York Herald Tribune reported that the Ern≈ë L√°szl√≥ Institute, specializing in beauty treatments and cosmetics, had leased a floor in a building on 677 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan. L√°szl√≥'s poor command of the English language threatened his institute, for despite the efforts of a language coach he could not pass the American Medical Association's accreditation examinations. The Ern≈ë L√°szl√≥ Institute was aimed at the rich, famous and powerful. One needed to be recommended to gain admittance. Among his clients were the Duchess of Windsor, Doris Duke, Marjorie Merriweather Post, Greta Garbo, Lillian Gish, Grace Kelly, Ava Gardner, Cecil Beaton, Katharine Hepburn, Paulette Goddard, Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. In the early 1940s, Helena Rubinstein approached L√°szl√≥ and offered to buy his business, but he declined. In 1945, L√°szl√≥ became a United States citizen. In 1966, L√°szl√≥ entered the retail marketplace, with partner Chesebrough-Ponds, which later bought the Ern≈ë L√°szl√≥ Institute. Personal life L√°szl√≥ married actress Ir√©n Gombasz√∂gi, whom he met while treating her sister, actress Frida Gombasz√∂gi. Ir√©n died of leukemia in 1967. Three years later, in 1970, he married Sibille Schulz in a ceremony near Lugano, Switzerland. Death L√°szl√≥ died of heart failure in March 1973. In 1995, the company L√°szl√≥ founded was bought by Mana Products from Elizabeth Arden. Mana Products' founder, Nikos Mouyiaris, had once worked for Ern≈ë L√°szl√≥ as a chemist. The company was purchased in 2002 by Cradle Holdings Inc., a division of corporate finance group Fox Paine. In February 2011, the RBS Special Opportunities Fund, managed by RBS Equity Finance, backed Charles Denton in the acquisition of Erno Laszlo.
