It is a line animation of \\"music as performance\\", in which actions of the film's characters are choreographed to the music of street musicians. Soon after returning from the 42nd Academy Awards in 1970, for which his animated short film Walking had been nominated, Larkin was loaned by the NFB to a Vancouver art school, where he stayed for eight months conducting animation workshops. He would travel to each student's studio to direct them, one of which was a group of street musicians. These street musicians were the origin of the idea for the film, as Larkin had stated that \\"they would make a great focal point for my abstract images\\". One of the figures in the film The film consists of five or six vaguely defined segments whose animation matches the pace of the music to which it is set. It begins with a photograph of a musician that is replaced by a line drawing of that photograph. A transition leads to images of a man's body transforming into abstract improvisational forms using line shading and watercolours. The figures undergo a continuous metamorphosis throughout the film. Chris Robinson stated that the film's awkward ending is indicative of Larkin's creative hesitancy, as the last image is a figure waiting for music. Larkin said that he \\"ran out of ideas\\" and \\"didn't know how to end the film\\". Street Musique won the Grand Prize at the Melbourne International Film Festival in 1973, which included a cash prize of from the Government of Victoria in Australia. The film also received the Jury's First Prize at the Berlin Film Festival of Animated Films. Larkin was fond of the Melbourne International Film Festival award because Street Musique \\"was a ten minute film up against all kinds of complicated feature films\\". He used the prize money to support young artists in Montreal, to whom he rented his nine-room apartment for . In 2000, after having lived on the streets in Montreal and spending his nights at the Old Brewery Mission, Larkin met Chris Robinson. During a discussion, Larkin told Robinson that after creating Street Musique, he was bereft of ideas for new projects. Robinson invited Larkin to be a member of the selection committee for the Ottawa International Animation Festival. The other three members were Chris Landreth, Pjotr Sapegin, and Andrei Svislotksi, none of whom were aware of Larkin's identity. After reviewing selections, they screened each other's films. Larkin was last, showing Walking, Street Musique, and Syrinx. Landreth was immediately inspired to create a documentary film about Larkin's life, which became Ryan. The animated documentary incorporated in their entirety Street Musique and Walking. Larkin's character in Ryan is animated to dance with characters from Street Musique.

He served as Director General Army Medical Services in 1914 and Director-General of the Medical Services of the British Armies in the Field during First World War. Biography He was the son of the late Inspector-General W. H. Sloggett, R.N., and of his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Cornish-Crossing J.P., of Stoke Damerel, Devon. Sloggett was educated at King's College London. Entering into the army as surgeon on 5 February 1881, he was soon promoted to Surgeon Captain and then Surgeon Major on 5 February 1893. In the Dongola Campaign of 1896, he served as senior medical officer of British Troops, was mentioned in dispatches in November 1896, and was specially promoted to surgeon Lieutenant-Colonel on 18 November 1896. During the Mahdist War, he served as Senior Medical Officer of the 1st Brigade, British Division, and took part in the battle of Khartum. He was dangerously wounded, when his horse was shot from under him, and he himself was shot through the chest by a bullet. For his services in the Nile Expedition he was mentioned in despatched in September 1898, and was specially promoted to the higher rate of pay of Lieutenant-Colonel on 16 October 1898. He also received the Egyptian medal with a clasp; a third class of the Order of the Medjidie; and the fourth class of the Osmanieh. He was appointed a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusulem on 7 March 1900. Sloggett then served in the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902, first in charge of the Imperial Yeomanry hospital, afterwards as principal medical officer of a general hospital, and then as commandant of Declfontein district and as Deputy Administrator for Cape Colony. He took part in operations in the Transvaal, the Orange River Colony, and Cape Colony. He was mentioned in dispatches in 1901, and received the Queen‚Äôs medal with three clasps, the King‚Äôs medal with two clasps, and was invested as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 9 September 1903. He was promoted to Surgeon-General on 13 May 1908, and then between 24 July 1908 and 30 December 1911 was Principal Medical Officer, 6th (Poona) Division in Bombay, India. In 1910 he was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 31 December 1911. He was appointed Principal Medical Officer at headquarters in India and Director of Medical Services in India. Sloggett also became an Honorary Surgeon to the King. On 1 June 1914, he was appointed Director General of the Army Medical Services, with the rank of Lieutenant-General. Two months after his appointment as Director-General, the First World War started. He was sent to France on 28 October 1914, taking up the roll of Director-General of Medical Services of the British Expeditionary Force and Chief Commissioner of the British Red Cross Society and St John Ambulance Association. The responsibility of dealing with and organising the whole of the medical services at home and abroad became too much for him and caused him to become ill. It was decided, therefore, that Sloggett should remain the Director-General on active service abroad and Sir Alfred Keogh rejoined the services from retirement to become Director-General on the duties at home. Sloggett remained in France for nearly four years, until June 1918, when his four years‚Äô term of office as Director- General came to an end. For his service during the war he was mentioned in dispatches seven times. He was made a Knight of the Order of the Bath and awarded the Legion of Honour in 1915, the Order of King Leopold of Belgium, Commander (3rd class) in 1916, and was invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George and a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1917. In 1917, he was also elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Sir Arthur Thomas Sloggett died suddenly while walking with his son near Regent's Park.

She inherited $20 million from her uncle Lewis Ginter, a tobacco business magnate and philanthropist, and she used the money to transform Richmond for the better. Grace Arents historical marker Oregon Hill Early life Arents was born in Manhattan, New York, the youngest of four children of cedar barrel maker James Arents and his wife Jane Swain Ginter Arents. When her husband died in 1855, Jane and her four young children received financial support from her uncle Lewis Ginter, a tobacco and streetcar business magnate, as well as Richmond real estate developer and philanthropist. In 1879, Arents and her mother moved to Richmond and lived with their bachelor uncle in the Ginter House, an urban brownstone at 405 East Cary Street near the city's business district. Her brother George also lived with them briefly, but rejoined his other two sisters in New York, where he became an avid collector and benefactor of the New York Public Library. Philanthropic career Trained as a nurse, as was common with women in the deaconess movement of that era, Arents helped establish the Richmond chapter of the Instructional Visiting Nurse Association, which also drew upon the lessons of the Settlement House movement, exemplified by Jane Addams in Chicago, among other socially active women. Arents valued her privacy fiercely, as had her uncle, and avoided publicity. She also avoided an ostentatious lifestyle. Arents never posed for a public portrait and few images of her have been found. She supported the Episcopal Church and became known for her work among the city's poor, mostly in a self-effacing way, or simply through her checkbook. When her uncle died in 1897, Arents inherited approximately $20 million, which she used to transform Richmond. One of her nicknames became the \\"Angel of Oregon Hill\\", referring to a poor neighborhood in her adopted city which received many of her philanthropic efforts. She was a voracious reader and in 1899 established the Grace Arents Free Library on (224) Cherry Street in Oregon Hill, the first free circulating library in Richmond; the building later became the William Byrd Community House.Oregon Hill District National Park Service Arents also financed the construction of three churches, including St. Andrew's, which was completed in 1903. Arents also donated money to establish a tuition-free school to teach neighborhood children, as well as a night school for working children and adults. She also built the first subsidized housing in the city. Arents donated the Lewis Ginter Community Building for the Ginter Park neighborhood, one of three areas of north Richmond that her uncle had helped develop (the others were Bellevue Park and Sherwood Park). Arents also expanded and renovated the Lakeside Wheel Club, which her uncle had built, transforming it into a convalescent home for sick children. Later, as other facilities filled that social niche, she turned the estate into a home and garden, called Bloemendaal. Arents deeded a life estate to her partner Mary Garland Smith upon her death, after which the City of Richmond received the property for a public botanical garden, known as the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden. An elementary school for which Arents donated land and $5,000 towards building costs was completed in 1911 and named in her honor. Since 1989 the site has housed Open High School (Virginia). Arents also helped establish the Playground at Clark Springs, one of Richmond's firstLewis Gintner; \\"Greatest\\" Richmond on the James Charitable support Among the many institutions she supported are: * St. Andrew‚Äôs Episcopal Church and its free school * Grace Arents Free Library on Cherry Street in Oregon Hill at 224 South Cherry in Oregon Hill (William Byrd Community House) * Grace Arents School (now Open High School) * Lewis Ginter Community Building for Ginter Park * Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden * St. Andrews School * Instructional Visiting Nurse Association * Playground at Clark Springs, one of Richmond's first Death and legacy Arents died on June 20, 1926, and is buried in the Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia).

The obituary in the Richmond News Leader said enumeration of the \\"libraries, recreational centers, schools, churches, hospitals, and similar institutions\\" would be impossible to list. On the 87th anniversary of her death, St. Andrew's church commemorated her life and continued legacy. However, she remains virtually unknown, having ordered her journals and other correspondence destroyed at her death.

It has an elevation of above sea level. History In 1847, Wiley Thompson (1799‚Äì1866), an Alabama farmer, brought his wife, eight children, and numerous slaves, and settled a tract of land along Larrison Creek. This land became the community of Forest. By the mid 1870s, the Thompson family had opened the first businesses, consisting of a store, saloon, watermill, gristmill, and cotton gin. The first postmaster of Forest was appointed in 1879. The Forest Baptist Church was established in 1888. During the 1920s and 1930s the Forest area produced tomatoes, and two tomato packing sheds were built beside the St. Louis Southwestern Railway of Texas. The post office was transferred to Wells in 1980. As of 2010, Forest is mostly a cattle community, and its only store is in and out of business. Forest has two cemeteries, Arnold Cemetery and Thompson Cemetery. Population Forest's population was reported as around 100 in the early twentieth century. In the 1950s, the population rose to its peak of 120. By 2000, it had dropped to 85. Education Forest School was established in 1888 in the Forest Baptist Church, and later occupied a separate building on a lot donated by J. S. Derrough, Jeff Latham, and Hugh Henry. In 1922, Forest School consolidated with the Wildhurst School from the Chronister Lumber Company Camp, and a new building was built on the old Jim Hogg Highway north of the Baptist Church in Forest. The new building housed the elementary and three unaccredited high school grades. Forest School consolidated with Wells ISD in 1949.

Background Air traffic controllers are people trained to maintain the safe, orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic in the global air traffic control system. The primary purpose of Air traffic control worldwide is to prevent collisions, organize and expedite the flow of traffic, and provide information and other support for pilots. In the United States, air traffic controllers are responsible for directing the flight paths of more than 60 million planes a year. The position of air traffic controller is one that requires highly specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities. Controllers apply separation rules to keep aircraft at a safe distance from each other in their area of responsibility and move all aircraft safely and efficiently through their assigned sector of airspace, as well as on the ground. Because controllers have an incredibly large responsibility while on duty (often in aviation, \\"on position\\") and make countless split-second decisions on a daily basis, the ATC profession is consistently regarded around the world as one of the most mentally challenging careers, and can be notoriously stressful depending on many variables (equipment, configurations, weather, traffic volume, human factors, etc.). Many controllers, however, would cite high salaries and a very large, unique, and privileged degree of autonomy as major advantages of their jobs. There are approximately 15,000 air traffic controllers in the United States. A sleep disorder, or somnipathy, is a medical disorder of the sleep patterns of a person or animal. Some sleep disorders are serious enough to interfere with normal physical, mental and emotional functioning. Polysomnography is a test commonly ordered for some sleep disorders. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. H.R. 3578 would authorize the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to implement or enforce a requirement providing for the screening, testing, or treatment of airmen or air traffic controllers for sleep disorders (including obstructive sleep apnea) only if it is adopted pursuant to a rulemaking proceeding. The bill would apply this Act only to a requirement adopted on or after November 1, 2013. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on December 4, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3578 would require the Secretary of Transportation to follow formal rulemaking procedures when establishing new requirements for certain types of medical tests for pilots and air traffic controllers. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 3578 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Based on information from the Federal Aviation Administration, the CBO estimates that any federal spending to pursue required rulemakings under the bill would not exceed $500,000 in any given year or over five years. Such spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Enacting H.R. 3578 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you- go procedures do not apply. H.R. 3578 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history H.R. 3578 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on November 21, 2013 by Rep. Frank A. LoBiondo (R, NJ-2). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. On February 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 3578 would be on the House schedule for February 11 or 12th, 2014, to be considered under a suspension of the rules.

In July 2018, Jorge Oti√±ano became the coach of the women's national team. This was formally announced at a press conference in August 2018.  Women's World Inline Hockey Championships = 1994  They made their international debut in Algarve, Portugal in 1994. They lost 6 - 0 to Brazil and 9 - 2 to Japan at this competition. Their first victory was an 8 - 0 win against Mexico and a 6 - 0 win against Andorra. This set them up to play in the 15th-place ranking match, which they won.

It is circumscribed by the perifovea. Photograph of the retina of the human eye, with overlay diagrams showing the positions and sizes of the macula, fovea, and optic disc Effect on reading In reading, information within 1¬∞ (approximately 6‚Äì8 characters) of the point of fixation is processed in foveal vision, while information up to 6¬∞ of visual angle benefits from parafoveal preview. Studies have shown that people can tell the difference in the letters of a word in the fovea and near-parafovea (the part of the parafovea closest to the fovea), but not in the outer edges of the parafovea. In languages that read from left to right, the word immediately to the right of the fixated word is known as the parafoveal word. Information present in the parafovea can interact with information present in the fovea. The benefit the parafoveal preview has is also mediated by how common the word in the parafovea is, with less common words providing less of a reduction in fixation duration when they reach foveal fixation. As the clarity of information in the parafovea is not as great as in the fovea, the SWIFT model of eye movements in reading, while allowing for parallel processing, accounts for this difference by assigning the parafoveal less processing power the further away it is from the foveal fixation. Effect on scene perception Information in the parafovea can influence the processing of a scene. In categorization tasks of natural scenes information from the parafovea can be used to determine the gist of a scene well enough for a categorization judgement, though with reduced sensitivity and speed in comparison to foveal vision. An effect of parafoveal preview has also been found for emotional scenes presented in the parafovea, with people more likely shift their fixation point on emotional stimuli than neutral stimuli, when both options are presented parafoveally.

It has more than 6,500 employees system-wide and is one of Northern Nevada's largest employers. History Renown Health, formerly known as the Washoe Health System, was founded in 1862 during a smallpox outbreak. The clinic became the area's first hospital when Nevada became a state in 1864. In 1875, 40 acres were purchased and the hospital opened the following year with 40 beds. The region's first pediatrics unit opened at Washoe Medical Center in 1949. A heart care unit was established by the organization in 1963. The organization established the first cancer treatment center in Northern Nevada in the 1970s. In 1979, the University of Nevada School of Medicine established a residency program at the hospital. The university later partnered with the hospital for brain fMRI research. In 1984, Washoe Health System transitioned to a private not-for- profit health network and became the region's only Level II Trauma Center between Sacramento, California and Salt Lake City, Utah and Renown Pregnancy Center (formerly Washoe Pregnancy Center) was established. Renown launched its not-for-profit insurance division, Hometown Health in 1988. In 1993, the hospital established its Healing Art Program which has grown to include music at the bedside, art at the bedside, pet therapy, healing arts performances and healing gardens. In 1999, the organization partnered with Barton Memorial Hospital to increase the number of health care programs in Carson Valley. In 2003, the organization expanded its services when it acquired a rehabilitation hospital. The region's first angiography biplane, used to treat patients who had a stroke, was introduced by the organization in 2004. That year, the first PET/CT was used for diagnosing and treating cancer in patients. In 2006, Washoe Health System changed its name to Renown Health. In 2007, Renown Health completed the Tahoe Tower at the Renown Regional Medical Center campus, a 10-story patient care tower featuring state-of-the art technology. Renown Health became the first hospital in Northern Nevada to perform robotic surgery using da Vinci Surgical System S HD in 2008. The area's first and only children's emergency room was opened in 2009, at the Renown Regional Medical Center. The emergency room was designed for patients under the age of 18 and included 11 children's exam rooms. The organization is the region's only Children's Miracle Network Hospital. Anthony D. Slonim became president and CEO of Renown Health in May 2014. In July 2014, Renown was the first on the west coast and fourth in the world to perform surgery with the da Vinci Xi. That year, Renown Health partnered with the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine to expand the medical school and increase the number of physicians who train and practice in Northern Nevada. In June 2016, Renown Health partnered with several Stanford University health facilities including Stanford Health Care, Stanford Children's Health and Stanford Medicine. The agreement was said to help reduce the need for patients to travel when seeking high-level care and allowed Stanford staff to be based in Northern Nevada. In August 2016, the organization received a $7.5 million donation from the William N. Pennington Foundation which helped it expand its pediatric care and form a pediatric medical residency partnership with University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine. Renown Health announced it would open a family practice clinic in South Reno in March 2017, bringing its total number of primary care clinics to 12. In April 2017, Renown Children's Hospital was the first hospital in Nevada to be certified by the National Safe Sleep Hospital Certification Program. The Healthy Nevada Project In September, 2016, Renown Health partnered with 23andMe and Desert Research Institute to provide 10,000 Northern Nevada residents with free genetic testing through the Healthy Nevada Project (HNP). The goal of the HNP is to study the complex relationship between a person's health, genetics, and environment. Public interest in the project resulted in rapid enrollment and an unexpectedly quick finish to the first phase of the study. This motivated an expansion of the project to encompass a total of 50,000 Nevadans. In starting its second phase, the HNP partnered with personal genomics company Helix in order to gather exome sequencing data‚Äîgreatly increasing the amount of genetic data collected. In exchange for participating in the HNP, Helix provided participants with a free genetic ancestry analysis as well as other educational insights. Phase II of the HNP launched on March 15, 2018. In October of that same year, HNP became one of the first population health studies in the country to return clinical results to study volunteers. Participants who opted-in to receiving clinical results were screened for genetic variants that significantly increase their risk of developing Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndrome, and Lynch Syndrome. In the first six months of phase II, approximately ~23,700 Nevadans were sequenced, 290 of which were found to have medically actionable results. The HNP has announced a plan to expand the project to a total of 250,000 Nevadans with expectations that approximately 1.3% will have results that are immediately impactful for their medical care.

Die √úberraschung (The Surprise, 1906?)  Life  Kaulbach was the son of painter Wilhelm von Kaulbach. He was originally a medical student at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich but, perhaps inspired by his father, quit school to study painting instead. In 1867, he became a student of Karl von Piloty. Under his influence, Kaulbach devoted himself almost entirely to historical themes. Ultimately though, he became best known for his portraits of children. He made two study trips to Rome, in 1880 and 1891. In 1886, he was appointed a Professor of History Painting at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich.Personalliste der AdbK, M√ºnchen (PDF) In 1906 he published a picture book, with children as the motif, that sold 135,000 copies.

Criticism Although his work was generally well received, he was occasionally criticized for giving too much attention to detail, while missing the significance of the painting's main subject.

The bill would extend the program until 2018. The National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act of 2013 was introduced into the 113th United States Congress. A similar measure, the Drought Information Act of 2013 (S. 376; 113th Congress), was introduced into and passed the United States Senate. President Barack Obama signed the National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act of 2013 into law as on March 6, 2014. Background United States Drought Monitor from February 4, 2014 The National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) Act was signed into law in 2006 (Public Law 109-430). The Western Governors' Association described the need for NIDIS in a 2004 report, Creating a Drought Early Warning System for the 21st Century: The National Integrated Drought Information System.Creating a Drought Early Warning System for the 21st Century: The National Integrated Drought Information System, The NIDIS Act calls for an interagency, multi-partner approach to drought monitoring, forecasting, and early warning, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\\"Activities and Plans of the National Integrated Drought Information System\\" http://conference.ifas.ufl.edu/CIMR/abstracts/Plenary%20Session%20Speaker%20Abstracts/Verdin.pdf The law also created the U.S. Drought Portal. NIDIS is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Climate Program Office. At the time that this legislation was being consider in committee, there were serious on-going water shortages in the United States. A drought that started in 2012 caused \\"some of the Great Lakes to drop to record lows,\\" hurt farms, and effected shipping on the Mississippi River. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act of 2013 would amend the National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 to specify that the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) Program's purpose shall be to better inform and provide for more timely decisionmaking to reduce drought related impacts and costs. The bill would revise NIDIS functions to require the NIDIS, among other things, to: (1) provide certain information, forecasts, and assessments described in the Act on both national and regional levels; (2) build upon existing forecasting and assessment programs and partnerships through designation of one or more cooperative institutes to assist with NIDIS functions; and (3) continue ongoing research and monitoring activities related to drought. The bill would require the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere (who is also the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)) to report to Congress on the NIDIS Program. The bill would reauthorize NIDIS through FY2018. Congressional Budget Office report right This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology on December 5, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 2431 would amend the National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006. The bill would authorize the appropriation of $13.5 million annually over the 2014-2018 period for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to maintain a system to provide early warnings of droughts by collecting and disseminating information and coordinating research on drought conditions. Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would cost $60 million over the 2014-2018 period and $8 million after 2018. Enacting H.R. 2431 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 2431 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 19, 2013 by Rep. Ralph M. Hall (R, TX-4). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and the United States House Science Subcommittee on Environment. On February 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 2431 would be on the House schedule for February 11 or 12th, 2014, to be considered under a suspension of the rules. On February 10, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 55 to pass the bill 365-21. On February 25, 2014, the United States Senate voted to pass the bill by unanimous consent. President Barack Obama signed it into law as on March 6, 2014. Debate and discussion Rep. Ralph Hall, speaking in support of the bill, said that \\"the National Integrated Drought Information System has been a highly effective program that provides the best available information and tools to monitor and predict droughts, assess the potential impacts, and better prepare for and mitigate the effects of droughts.\\" Supporters of the bill argued that the system is necessary to collect information needed to analyse weather and climate data. Executive Director of the Western States Water Council Tony Willardson argues in favor of the bill, saying that \\"it's hard to analyze data you don't have... NIDIS is a very important tool for evaluating the impacts of drought. It's what we've been looking for, for a long time, as a clearinghouse of drought information.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress Notes/ReferencesExternal links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 2431 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 2431 *GovTrack.us H.R. 2431 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 2431 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 2431 Category:United States federal agriculture legislation Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress Category:Droughts in the United States Category:United States federal environmental legislation ","title":"National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act of 2013"},{"id":"41875716","text":"Ederson Trindade Lopes or simply Eder (born December 31, 1984) is a Brazilian football player.

Directed by Robert Gist, the film was originally produced by Four Star Television as a television pilot for a proposed NBC series named Royal Bay which was to star Burke as a lawyer and Bickford as his cantankerous, righteous father. Following the successful film- to-television progressions of movie stars such as Lucille Ball and Barbara Stanwyck, Crawford attempted the same maneuver with Royal Bay, a soap opera in a fictional seaside town where she was the wealthy matriarch and daughter of the town's founder. However, the pilot centered on the two characters that would most likely not reprise their role for the series, mother and daughter Della and Jenny Chappell. This may have been one of the reasons the pilot was released as a standalone film instead of the start of a series.\\"Della\\". Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved February 7, 2014. Plot Della Chappell (Joan Crawford) is a reclusive wealthy woman, consumed by power and dedicated to protecting the future of her daughter Jenny (Diane Baker). Her father founded the town of Royal Bay and she still owns most of it. An outside company wants to buy parts of the town for development but Della refuses to consider the option. Barney Stafford (Paul Burke), a lawyer representing the developers' interests, butts heads with Della frequently. She invites him to her home for a meeting at 2:00 AM. Barney, eager to settle the matter, heads over to Della's estate and instead he meets Jenny. Barney notices strange happenings at the house, such as everyone sleeping during the day and all business is conducted in the middle of the night. He comes to learn that Jenny has a skin condition that prevents her from being in the light and keeps her inside the home at all times. At a particularly tense meeting, Della attempts to employ Barney in a veiled attempt to buy his company for Jenny. After a discussion with his father, Barney goes to apologize to Della. After all is revealed (why Jenny must never leave) Barney leaves, presumably for good.

Because the studio was disappointed in the final result of the pilot film, the plans for a TV series were scrapped and Royal Bay was renamed Della. The short film ‚Äî just a little over 70 minutes ‚Äî received a limited theatrical release in the United States on August 8, 1964. Joan Crawford and Diane Baker played mother and daughter for the second time in only a few months, following the horror classic, Strait-Jacket earlier that year. Home video releases Following years of obscurity, the film was finally released on videocassette under the title Fatal Confinement by a company called International Film Forum in 1988.Fatal Confinement (Della) videocassette at Amazon. On January 31, 2012, Della was released as an exclusive manufacture-on-demand DVD-R through the TCM Shop.Della DVD at TCM.

Under the leadership of UNESCO, the IYL 2015 brought together hundreds of national and international partners to organize more than 13,000 activities in 147 countries. The audience reached by the IYL 2015 is estimated to be over 100 million. History The first idea for an International Year of Light dates back to 2009 when John Dudley, IYL 2015 Steering Committee Chair, proposed the idea whilst representing the Quantum Electronics and Optics Division (QEOD) of the European Physical Society (EPS) at a meeting of the International Council of Quantum Electronics (ICQE) in Baltimore, USA. An item that was discussed at this meeting was how to follow up activities that were planned to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the laser (LaserFest) in 2010 with something even more ambitious. The photonics community felt that there was a real opportunity to reach out beyond the scientific sector to raise much broader awareness of the problem-solving potential of light-based science in so many areas of life, and to make a global effort to influence education and policy in both developed and developing countries. The proposal was endorsed by ICQE and thus began the adventure towards IYL 2015. International Years are part of the United Nations (UN) declared observances that promote awareness of issues relevant to its aims and international programmes. The first step to successfully achieve the proclamation of the International Year was to work through UNESCO to prepare and submit a resolution to the UN General Assembly. But before this, EPS had to construct the proposal in detail and build a consortium amongst the major optics and physics societies. During 2010 and 2011, the main motivations and goals for IYL 2015 were drafted, and it was decided that 2015 would be the target year based on several key scientific anniversaries. With the support of the EPS President Luisa Cifarelli, an important milestone occurred in September 2011 when the Italian Physical Society and EPS organized in Varenna, Italy, the Passion for Light launch meeting for IYL 2015, where representatives of UNESCO and the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (UNESCO-ICTP) were present, both to learn more about our plans and to show their support. This was the essential step that brought the guidance and experience of UNESCO's International Basic Science Programme to the proposal. With the help of the Institute of Physics (especially Sir Peter Knight who was the president at the time), EPS led a delegation to the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) General Assembly in London, United Kingdom, during November 2011 to obtain endorsement, providing an important green light recognizing the international nature of the proposal. At this point there were many partners involved: in addition to EPS and its own European member societies, the IYL 2015 team included the African Physical Society, the American Physical Society, the Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies, the Chinese Optical and Physical Societies, the European Optical Society, the International Commission for Optics (ICO), the IEEE Photonics Society, the Optical Society (OSA), the international society for optics and photonics (SPIE), as well as many other partners and societies from Africa, Australia, Canada, the Middle East, New Zealand, South America, and elsewhere. From March 2012 things moved quickly. With help from the Director of UNESCO's International Basic Science Programme Dr. Maciej Nalecz, a consortium of supporting UNESCO member states was assembled. Much support was needed from a number of international scientific partners at this stage, and it is essential here to acknowledge Francis Allotey (Ghana) and Ana Mar√≠a Cetto (Mexico) for their leading roles. Other assistance was provided by Zsolt Fulop (Hungary), John Harvey and Geoff Austin (New Zealand), Zohra Ben Lakhdar and Mourad Zghal (Tunisia), Joe Niemela (UNESCO-ICTP), Lluis Torner (Spain) and Sergei Bagaev and Victor Zadkov (Russia). A resolution supporting IYL 2015 was prepared and was adopted by the UNESCO Executive Board at its 190th session which took place at the UNESCO HQ in Paris, France, 3‚Äì18 October 2012. The resolution was placed before the Executive Board by Ghana, Mexico, the Russian Federation (Board Members), and New Zealand (UNESCO Member State). UNESCO delegates from Ghana and Mexico introduced the proposal to the Executive Board. The resolution was adopted by the Executive Board joined by co-signatories from a further 27 Board Members: Angola, Bangladesh, Brazil, Burkina Faso, China, Congo, Cuba, Djibouti, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Kenya, Indonesia, Italy, Malawi, Nigeria, Peru, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Thailand, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, the United States of America, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. Other Member States of UNESCO who declared support for the initiative were Hungary, Serbia, and South Africa. UNESCO's official support opened the gate to approach the UN General Assembly to officially endorse the International Year. In early 2013 a meeting amongst the international stakeholders proposed ICTP as the Global Coordination Secretariat. Later in the year, with the help of UNESCO, the IYL 2015 Steering Committee was invited by Mexico to defend the proposal in New York, United States of America, at an information meeting held at UN Headquarters in May 2013. Ana Maria Cetto and John Dudley led a delegation that also included representatives of the African Physical Society (Yanne Chembo), ICTP and OSA (Anthony Johnson) and SPIE (H. Philip Stahl). After the May 2013 meeting, Mexico led the political process to draft a resolution for the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly which would begin in September 2013. The second half of 2013 was extremely busy, as the IYL 2015 Steering Committee really did need the declaration to be made before the end of 2013 in order to have a full 12 months to prepare. The UNESCO Executive Board resolution was endorsed by the UNESCO General Conference at its 37th session on 19 November 2013. In parallel, a resolution was submitted to the United Nations Second Committee on 6 November 2013 by the nation of Mexico, with delegates from both Mexico and New Zealand speaking in support. The resolution was adopted with co- sponsorship from 35 countries: Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chile, China, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, France, Ghana, Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mauritius, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Palau, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Somalia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine and United States of America. Finally, the resolution A/RES/68/221 proclaiming the IYL 2015 was adopted on 20 December 2013 during a plenary meeting of the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly.  Vision goals and objectives  The IYL 2015 was a yearlong series of events and activities with the aim of highlighting to the citizens of the world the importance of light science and optical technologies in leading to improved quality of life and for the future development of society. A particular objective was to focus on application areas related to sustainable development, and to show how light-based technologies can provide practical solutions to global challenges in areas such as renewable energy, education, agriculture, and healthcare.  Motivation  Light plays a central role in human activities. People throughout the world and across history have always attached great importance to light. We have seen this in cultural symbolism, universal myths and legends, and in the many ways that studying the science of light and applying it in practical applications has shaped the societies in which we live. Light is the means by which human beings see themselves, each other, and their place in the Universe. Light is an essential part of culture and art, and is a unifying symbol for the world. On the most fundamental level through photosynthesis, light is necessary to the existence of life itself, and the many applications of light have revolutionized society through medicine, communications, entertainment and culture. Industries based on light are major economic drivers, and light-based technologies directly respond to the needs of humankind by providing access to information, promoting sustainable development, and increasing societal health and well-being.  Goals  The major goals of the International Year of Light 2015 were: * Improve the public understanding of how light and light-based technologies touch the daily lives of everybody, and are central to the future development of the global society. * Build worldwide educational capacity through activities targeted on science for young people, addressing issues of gender balance, and focusing especially on developing countries and emerging economies. * Enhance international cooperation by acting as a central information resource for activities coordinated by learned societies, NGOs, government agencies, educational establishments, industry, and other partners. * Focus on particular discoveries in the history of science that have shown the fundamental centrality of light in the development of knowledge, and highlight the continuous nature of discovery in different historical and cultural contexts, * Emphasise the importance of basic research in the fundamental science of light, the need for investment in light-based technology to develop new applications, and the global necessity to promote careers in science and engineering in these fields. * Promote the importance of lighting technology and the need for access to light and energy infrastructure in sustainable development, and for improving quality of life in the developing world. * Raise awareness that technologies and design can play an important role in the achievement of greater energy efficiency, in particular by limiting energy waste, and in the reduction of light pollution, which is key to the preservation of dark skies. * Highlight and explain the intimate link between light and art and culture, enhancing the role of optical technology to preserve cultural heritage. * Maintain these goals and achievements in the future beyond the International Year of Light. The International Year of Light contributes significantly to fulfilling the missions of UNESCO to the building of peace, the alleviation of poverty, to sustainable development and intercultural dialogue through education, science, culture, and communication. In this context the goals of IYL 2015 align with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals which were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015.  Anniversaries during 2015  The year 2015 was a natural candidate for the International Year of Light as it represented the remarkable conjunction of a number of important milestones in the history of the science of light.  Great works on optics by Ibn Al-Haytham - over 1000 years  The year 2015 marks the 1000th anniversary since the appearance of the remarkable seven-volume treatise on optics Kitab al-Manazir, written by the Arab scientist Ibn al-Haytham (also known by the Latinization Alhazen or Alhacen),.The Latin forms of his name, remain in popular use, but are out of use in scholarly contexts. Born around a thousand years ago in present-day Iraq, Ibn Al-Haytham was a pioneering scientific thinker who made important contributions to the understanding of vision, optics, and light. Today, many consider him a pivotal figure in the history of optics and the \\"Father of modern optics\\". He was the first person to explain that vision occurs when light bounces on an object and then is directed to one's eyes. Ibn Al-Haytham was one of the earliest scientists to study the characteristics of light and the mechanism/process of vision. He sought experimental proof of his theories and ideas. During many years living in Egypt, he composed one of his most celebrated works, Kitab al-Manazir, whose title is commonly translated into English as Book of Optics but more properly has the broader meaning Book of Vision. Ibn Al-Haytham made significant advances in optics, mathematics, and astronomy. His work on optics was characterised by a strong emphasis on carefully designed experiments to test theories and hypotheses. In that regard he was following a procedure somewhat similar to the modern scientific method.  Fresnel and his theory of light as a wave - 1815  Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788-1827) was a French engineer and physicist who contributed significantly to the establishment of the theory of wave optics, publishing a pioneering memoire on diffraction in 1815. At the end of the 18th century, physics was dominated by Newton's particle theory of light. Fresnel disliked Newton's theory of light mainly because of its failure to explain such basic optical phenomena as the interference effect. By developing his ideas on the wave nature of light into a comprehensive mathematical theory, Fresnel determined properties that every future theory of light would have to satisfy, and created the groundwork for the later work of James Clerk Maxwell. The wave view did not immediately displace the ray and particle view, but began to dominate scientific thinking about light in the mid 19th century since it could explain polarization phenomena that the alternatives could not. It was not until the early 20th century that the photoelectric effect introduced firm evidence of a particle nature of light as well, therefore, paving the way for the wave-particle duality of light.  Maxwell describes his theory of light - 1865  Another milestone commemorated in the IYL 2015 is the 150th anniversary of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light, a theory that changed the world forever. James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879), born in Scotland, is considered as one of the most important scientists of all time and one of the greats in the history of physics along with Newton and Einstein. Undoubtedly, his most important scientific contribution is the theory of the electromagnetic field, fundamental not only for the comprehension of natural phenomena, but also for its many current technical applications, particularly in telecommunications. His 1865 paper, A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field, provides a complete theoretical basis for the treatment of classical electromagnetic phenomena. He proved that the equations of the electromagnetic field could combine into a wave equation and suggested the existence of electromagnetic waves. Calculating the speed of propagation of these waves, he obtained the value of the speed of light, and concluded that it was an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell also left us outstanding contributions to colour theory, optics, Saturn's rings, statics, dynamics, solids, instruments, and statistical physics. However, his most important contributions were to electromagnetism.  Einstein and the General Theory of Relativity - 1915  The year 2015 marked the 100th anniversary of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who revolutionized our understanding of the universe, and who is widely acknowledged as the most important scientist of the 20th Century. Einstein's General Theory of Relativity fundamentally changed the way we understand gravity and the universe in general. He gave us a way to understand the universe as a whole and created one of the most beautiful theories in the history of science. The General Theory of Relativity gives us the law of gravitation and its relation to the other forces of nature. From Newton we knew about the \\"strength\\" of gravity, but his theory did not tell us how gravity pulls on things. In the General Theory of Relativity, the doctrine of space and time no longer figures as a fundamental independent of the rest of physics. Rather, the geometrical behaviour of bodies and the motion of clocks depend on gravitational fields, which in turn are produced by matter. General Relativity helped to predict the existence of black holes, which are regions of the spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing ‚Äì not even light ‚Äì can escape. The theory also has important implications for cosmology, the study of the structure of the Universe. One of the consequences of the theory is that not only is the universe finite, but should be contracting or expanding, something that was confirmed years later by the US astronomer Edwin Hubble. One of the most revolutionary predictions of the theory was the existence of gravitational waves, ripples in space-time that propagate in much the same way that ripples spread across the surface of a pond. It was only in 2016 that the LIGO experiment finally confirmed their existence, opening a new window for observing the cosmos that could change our understanding of the universe. It is worth noting here that this experimental confirmation of General Relativity, like that of Special Relativity before it, was based on using an optical instrument - an interferometer. This reveals the power of light-based technologies in not only driving applications but also supporting research into very fundamental physics.  Penzias and Wilson discover the Microwave Background - 1965  In 1965, the American astronomers Arno Penzias (1933) and Robert Woodrow Wilson (1936) announced the discovery of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation. This radiation is a relic of the light that filled the early cosmos almost 14 billion years ago, that can still be observed today across the sky at much longer wavelengths than visible light, in the domain of microwaves. Finding the CMB represented a triumph for the \\"Big Bang\\" description of the Universe. Penzias and Wilson won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978 for their discovery. The detection of the CMB triggered a series of increasingly accurate experiments and detailed theoretical calculations over the past fifty years, searching for more information about the universe in this early cosmic signal. Initially NASA's COBE and WMAP satellites, and in recent years ESA's Planck satellite, have provided precise maps of the CMB that enable astrophysicists to delve into the history of the Universe, constraining its geometry and the properties of its constituents. Together with other observations, these data led to the \\"standard model\\" for cosmology: a spatially flat Universe dominated not only by dark matter, but also by the mysterious dark energy, responsible for accelerating the present expansion of the cosmos.  Charles Kao develops optical fibre communications - 1965  Charles K. Kao (1933) is a Chinese- born Hong Kong, American, and British electrical engineer and physicist who pioneered the development and use of fiber optics in telecommunications. Kao's research laid the groundwork for high-speed data communication and the Information Age. When Kao started work, it seemed impossible to use light for transmitting information because the available materials simply had too much loss. But Kao showed that the fibre-manufacturing process was the cause of the absorption problem, and that under better technical conditions, light could travel vast distances before being weakened by absorption. These findings unleashed a series of technological improvements and advancements, launching a new age in the history of telecommunications. For this reason Charles Kao is regarded as the \\"father of fiber optic communication.\\" In 2009, Charles Kao was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \\"for groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibres for optical communication.\\" Organization=IYL 2015 Governance The coordination of IYL 2015 was through its steering committee that provided overall direction and guidance for IYL 2015 activities. A smaller executive board of the steering committee was responsible for many operational matters, supported by the IYL 2015 Global Secretariat located at the UNESCO Category I Institute, ICTP in Trieste, Italy. A broader advisory board played an important role in allowing them to link with diverse communities worldwide.  IYL 2015 Global Secretariat  The central hub for the IYL 2015 was the Global Secretariat located at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy. The secretariat coordinated activities during the planning, execution, and evaluation of the IYL 2015. The secretariat liaised continuously with UNESCO, the National Nodes, Partners, the media, and the general public to ensure the progress of the IYL 2015 at all levels.  IYL 2015 National Nodes  The IYL 2015 facilitated the creation of an international network to act at national and local levels. National Nodes were formed in 94 different countries to coordinate, promote, and implement IYL 2015 activities taking into account the needs and characteristics of different regions around the world. These nodes established collaborations between major national and local communities involved with IYL 2015 in each country and established a national committee that included a wide range of different partner representatives. In some cases, UNESCO National Commission members played an important role in such committees. Relying on National Nodes was indispensable for the success of the whole project as they provided local contact points for all those interested in participating in the IYL 2015. They also provided invaluable service in translating the international resources that were developed in English into local languages. This was especially vital in reaching school-age children and the public at large in many countries. Of course, within some countries, activities were not organised centrally via a national node, but events during 2015 still took place through ad hoc local organising committees.  Partners  IYL 2015 brought together 189 national and international partners in a multi-disciplinary consortium. IYL 2015 was endorsed by a number of scientific unions and the International Council of Science. Amongst the German Physical Societythe Founding Partners of IYL 2015 were: * American Institute of Physics (AIP) * American Physical Society (APS) * German Physical Society (DPG) * European Physical Society (EPS) * Abdus Salam International Centre of Theoretical Physics (ICTP) * IEEE Photonics Society * Institute of Physics (IOP) * Light: Science and Applications * The international lightsources.org network * 1001 Inventions * Optical Society (OSA) * International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE)  IYL 2015 Activities Overview  The IYL 2015 has been one of the most successful and visible of any of UNESCO's international observances, with 13,168 registered activities involving an estimated reach of more than 100 million people. IYL 2015 was visible in a total of 147 countries worldwide through a combination of: event organisation (129 countries), or political support and commemorative stamps and coins (a further 18 countries).  Event Breakdown  An analysis of the different type of events carried out during 2015 is given in the figure below described in terms of a number of different categories. Note that some events included several different activities (e.g. scientific lectures embedded within an art show) but in such cases we chose to include the event in the category corresponding to the primary activity that appeared in promotion. An approximate regional breakdown of the events that took place during 2015 is as follows: Africa (27 countries, 654 activities); the Americas (30 countries, 4,501 activities); Asia (39 countries, 2,000 activities); Europe (45 countries, 5,844 activities) and Oceania (2 countries, 169 activities). An indicative breakdown of the distribution of activities is as follows: Multi-day scientific conferences (30%); Light-themed exhibitions and festivals (25%); One day conferences and special events (22%); Activities in schools (10%); Art and music and light shows (6%); Citizen Science activities (3%); Other e.g. Light-themed competitions, Open Days, Launch Events, Stamps and Coins etc. (4%).  Selected Activities  Opening Ceremony 19‚Äì20 January 2015, Paris, France = The IYL 2015 Opening Ceremony took place over 19‚Äì20 January at the iconic UNESCO Headquarters Fontenoy Building in Paris, France. More than 1,200 participants from more than 86 countries gathered to listen to 55 speakers covering diverse topics in light science and applications. Speakers included diplomats and UNESCO leaders, five Nobel laureates, NGO representatives, and industry CEOs. Subjects addressed themes such as: education and outreach; the basic physics of light; applications to the life sciences and health; energy and climate change; new light technologies; astronomy and light pollution; and culture and art. A panel discussion amongst political leaders addressed challenges for the future, and the speaker programme was complemented by performances from the New Zealand Maori group NgƒÅti RƒÅnana and the American violinist Joshua Bell. The Opening Ceremony also featured an extensive exhibition of educational resources from sponsors and partners, art and culture and music displays, and a historical exhibit on 1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham. And outside the conference hall, the faces of the UNESCO building were lit up for three nights in the colours of the Aurora Borealis in a spectacular large-scale installation, Light is Here, by the Finnish Artist Kari Kola. = Closing Ceremony 4‚Äì6 February 2016, M√©rida, Mexico = The IYL 2015 Closing Ceremony took place over 4‚Äì6 February 2016 in the city of M√©rida, Mexico. Over 300 participants reviewed the activities and major outcomes of the IYL 2015 and discussed enduring legacies. A message from the Secretary General of United Nations, Ban Ki Moon, stressed the tremendous positive outcome of the year, stating how \\"IYL 2015 has shown how the science of light, photonics, and related technologies can promote sustainable development in many fields, including climate change and energy, agriculture, health, and education.\\" Speakers included two Nobel laureates and representatives from many other diverse sectors, and the topics covered in talks included health and life science, architecture and urban environments, new light sources for research, optics and photonics, cultural heritage, light pollution awareness, and science education. An important component of the Closing Ceremony were a series of interactive Panel Discussions which encouraged audience participation in defining follow-up actions for the future, going beyond the IYL 2015. Cultural and educational activities for the general public in M√©rida were also organized to accompany the Closing Ceremony. Events such as a film festival, art installations, and an outreach programme in high schools and universities attracted 14,000 participants. The ceremony was officially closed with a visit to the archaeological site Chich√©n Itz√°, with lectures on Mayan culture and archeoastronomy, and a light and sound show over the Temple of Kukulcan. = Education Focus = Teaching activities involving light and optics naturally lend themselves to student participation and can serve as a very effective gateway into science for young people. All countries participating in IYL 2015 included a strong focus on education, and indeed in some cases light was chosen as a major theme of centrally coordinated National and Regional Science Weeks. This was the case, for example, in: Australia, Brazil, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, France, Germany, Mexico and Slovakia. It is worth describing the impact of several of these national initiatives in more detail: activities in Brazil in October‚ÄìNovember 2015 included specific events with indigenous communities and visually impaired people; 3,500 people attended the Week of Science in Kinshasa in April 2015 on the theme of Light and Energy in the Democratic Republic of Congo; Mexico's 22nd National Science Week in November 2015 was dedicated to the IYL 2015 reaching out to over 100,000 people; the Czech Academy of Sciences dedicated its annual November science and technology festival to light and held interactive workshops for children; the Canary Islands (Spain) organized its Science Week in November 2015 combining both IYL 2015 and the International Year of Soils 2015 as its theme for the activities. Many events had special focus on school-age children. In Bangladesh, a hands-on programme Spark of Light was conducted in 37 schools in the country reaching 2,500 high-school students; around 1,500 elementary and middle school students in five schools in China participated in the Seed of Light programme; El Salvador and Mongolia organized their National Physics Olympiads around IYL 2015; a particular regional activity in Europe was the eTwinning initiative which ran a contest for students from 62 classes from 22 different countries who had to design an experiment to explain the properties of light; the Franche-Comt√© region in France organised a public outreach programme LUX! which reached 13,000 young people and members of the public in one weekend; the Children's Museum in Jordan organised an exhibit and storytelling activities on \\"Colours\\" for three months in 2015 which was visited by 36,000 children; a three-month programme of the Macedonian Montessori Association implemented children's workshops in art and science of light; a Portuguese programme \\"Bringing Light to Schools\\" included teacher training in how to use light-based technologies to stimulate student interest; one event in South Africa was a year-long programme bringing light-based teaching resources to the disadvantaged area of Mamelodi targeting five local schools and 400 pupils; events in Tunisia included hands-on activities in six secondary schools in rural regions of the country. = Light Poverty = Globally, around 1.1 billion people still do not have access to electricity and reliable lighting infrastructure. A central aim of IYL 2015 was to raise awareness of this issue, since eradicating such \\"light poverty\\" is clearly a vital step in addressing numerous development goals. Many IYL 2015 partners made this topic a major feature of their activities: the CEO of the IYL 2015 Patron Sponsor Philips Lighting spoke on this subject at the Opening Ceremony held at UNESCO HQ, and indeed the company focussed on providing practical solutions in many regions of the world, including an agreement to provide street lighting for 800 villages in Uttar Pradesh in India; IYL 2015 partners also participated in the public-private collective Power for All campaign that kicked off during 2015 to promote universal energy access by 2030; the IEEE Photonics Society teamed up with the NGOs SolarAid and Unite-to-Light to donate 3,200 solar lamps to remote regions in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and the Philippines; the Solar Lights for Learning project organized educational activities and solar lantern distribution to children from schools in Namibia, Guatemala, Kenya, Chile, and Peru; a multipartner initiative led by the ICTP-linked LAM Network in Senegal delivered solar lamps also used as cell phones chargers, to schools and populations in remote villages; the VELUX Group collaborated with the social business Little Sun to distribute 14,500 solar lamps in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone. Other organizations focussed on raising more general awareness through novel initiatives. For example, CCT-SeeCity - a partner of NGO Liter of Light - ran a night-time artistic and cultural walking tour of cities in Europe (Rome, Madrid, London, Berlin, and Paris) to raise funds for low-cost solar lighting installation at a centre for women and children in a suburban village of Dakar in Senegal. = Gender, diversity, and inclusion = Promoting the need for gender parity in science has been a major theme of the IYL 2015, aiming to address the well-known problem of minority participation of women in science, particularly at the highest level. The IYL 2015 has worked hard in addressing this issue from its inception, and achieved 35% participation of high-level women scientists in its governing bodies and as speakers in the official Opening and Closing Ceremonies. Although such gender ratios are superior to those usually associated with the organisation of scientific bodies and conferences, clearly much more still needs to be done. Many IYL 2015 partners worked on particular initiatives to promote careers in science and engineering for young girls, as well as to improve the gender- balanced representation of scientists at all levels. Such initiatives included hands-on workshops, panels, seminars, competitions, and exhibitions highlighting women in science. Particular partner activities included: the organisation of 64 activities by the IEEE Photonics Society's Women in Photonics and Young Professionals initiative, and the Introduce a Girl to Photonics Week in October 2015; SPIE organized events such as the annual Women in Optics Presentation during their flagship Photonics West Conference in the US in February 2015, including a panel discussion amongst women scientists on The Road Less Travelled: Women in Science & Technology Leadership; the OSA organized the Minorities and Women in OSA program/reception during the Frontiers in Optics conference in October 2015 and was involved with community initiatives such as the Girl Scouts USA/hands-on science demonstrations during the OFC conference in March 2015; the European project LIGHT2015 created a new prize for Early-Career Women in Photonics; ICFO in Spain organised a Girls and Boys and Photonics event and Girls Guide Australia developed specific educational resources on light for IYL 2015. Other initiatives reached out to tackle problems such as the violence against women. The Woman Scream International Poetry and Arts Festival 2015 - organized from the Dominican Republic - used the theme of \\"Women of Light\\" in over 160 events in 36 countries during March 2015 to honour women and create a conscious call against violence to women through artistic expressions. A number of IYL 2015 initiatives focussed especially on those affected by war and natural disasters: the Physics for All activity from the German Physical Society DPG brought the themes of IYL 2015 to newly arrived refugee communities within Germany, and the Nepalese IYL 2015 committee focussed mainly on activities and support for students and schools in areas impacted by the severe April 2015 earthquake. IYL 2015 also supported the other inclusion challenges faced by society. In Thailand, UNESCO Bangkok and many other partners cooperated to light the fa√ßade of the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre with a rainbow-coloured display on 17 May 2015 to commemorate the International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia. In another initiative, iconic landmarks and buildings throughout the Ireland were lit orange to commemorate World Suicide Prevention Day on 10 September 2015. = High-Level Support = The IYL 2015 partners and national committees worked very hard to reach out towards high-level decision makers through targeted events during the year. Although certainly one aim of outreach is towards the public at large, initiatives that brought together scientific and political partners were considered essential to ensure that IYL 2015 initiatives would have a lasting impact well beyond the international year itself. One approach to this was to seek high level patronage from figures of state. Such support included: Queen Letizia of Spain chairing the Spanish Committee of Honor of the International Year of Light; Prince Andrew, Duke of York was the patron of IYL 2015 in the UK; the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, acted as patron of IYL 2015 in Ireland; President Francois Hollande was patron of the launch of the International Year of Light in France. In addition, President Mahama of Ghana provided a message for the African Regional Conference and Exhibition on Harnessing Light and Light-based Technologies for Africa's Development. Governments also recognized the IYL 2015 at the highest levels: The National Assembly of Korea passed a resolution in support on 16 February 2015; the Puerto Rico House of Representatives passed a resolution in support on 1 June 2015; and the International Year of Light was highlighted in the United States Senate with a statement that appears in the US Congressional Record for 17 December 2015. Other official events also commemorated IYL 2015. In the UK, two events were organised by the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee to raise awareness of the photonics sector; the closure of the IYL 2015 in Andorra was celebrated at the headquarters of the Parliament of Andorra; Member of the Duma and Nobel Laureate Zhores Alferov spoke on the IYL 2015 and topics of light technology at the Russian Parliament. In addition to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, high-level events with participation of UNESCO leadership included: two events at UNESCO HQ as part of the UNESCO Executive Board Future Prospects initiative with the participation of Nobel Laureates William D. Phillips (21 January 2015) and Hiroshi Amano (8 June 2015); the participation of the UNESCO Director General at the launch of IYL 2015 in Algeria (11 April 2015); the participation of the UNESCO Assistant Director General at the world's largest combined academic-industry photonics conference in Germany on 22 June 2015 and at the opening of The Islamic Golden Age of Science for the Knowledge-Based Society conference at UNESCO HQ on 14 September 2015. Other significant events of this type also included: the UNESCO National Commission of Ghana organised the African Regional Conference and Exhibition on Harnessing Light and Light-based Technologies for Africa's Development in Accra from 14‚Äì16 September 2015; a special session on IYL 2015 held at the UNESCO co-organised World Science Forum in Budapest on 6 November 2015; a side event to the 2016 ECOSOC Youth Forum held at the UN HQ in New York on 2 February 2016 organised by Founding Partner 1001 Inventions. IYL 2015 also stimulated many national and regional initiatives to promote light science and technology. The European Commission provided strong support through its Photonics Unit and the Photonics21 Public Private Partnership; an event organised at the National Academy of Sciences on 12 September 2015 brought together high-level partners within the USA; many other countries such as Canada, Singapore, and the UK developed new networks and/or reports promoting the impact of photonics and the need for continued investment. France hosted the highly significant COP21 climate change conference from 5‚Äì12 December 2015, which included the participation of IYL 2015 Partner Liter of Light that promoted ecologically sustainable and cost-free lighting in developing countries. = Scientific Conferences = Nearly all optics conferences on the regular scientific calendar for 2015 made some special effort to promote the broader goals of the IYL 2015. A description of some particular events organised especially for 2015 follows. In addition to the African Regional Conference and Exhibition in Accra, major conferences were held elsewhere in Africa. In Cameroon, an international workshop from 24‚Äì27 November 2015 in Yaound√© attracted 100 students and young professionals from Africa and internationally. The IEEE AFRICON 2015 conference in Addis-Ababa Ethiopia from 14‚Äì17 September 2015 included a workshop focused on photonics research for African Development. In South Africa, the University of Fort Hare together with ICTP organized a workshop in Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa from 28 September - 1 October 2015 that was attended by 80 delegates from over 25 countries. A major scientific conference in South America was Colombia in the International Year of Light 2015 that was held in the cities of Bogot√° and Medell√≠n on 16‚Äì19 June 2015 attracting over 2,000 participants. In Ecuador, the OptoAndina 2015 event in Quito from 11‚Äì13 November 2015 attracted students from Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, and M√©xico. In El Salvador, an international workshop on optical spectroscopy from 25‚Äì30 March 2015 brought together academic and governmental institutions from Mexico and El Salvador, with a focus on concerns related to using optical techniques to detect dangerous materials and narcotics. Elsewhere, a three-day international symposium on Light and Life was organized in Islamabad, Pakistan, from 14‚Äì16 October 2015; events in Europe during 2015 included the Laser World of Photonics congress from 22‚Äì25 June 2015 in Germany, and a workshop on an African synchrotron facility held at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France from 16‚Äì20 November 2015. In the US, the 2015 Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics Annual Meeting from 9‚Äì10 March 2015 in Raleigh, North Carolina included Nobel Laureate speakers and many panel discussions covering themes in science and development. In the Republic of Korea, the Optical Society of Korea meeting in Gyeongju included a panel discussion on the future of light science and technologies. Worldwide, many laboratories and photonics institutes worldwide held open days for students and the public to learn about the work of research and optical science. One coordinated event in particular was the International Illumination Commission (CIE) Gold Open Lab where over 50 laboratories in 19 countries held open days in the period from 9‚Äì25 May 2015. = IYL 2015 Festivals and Events running over Multiple Days = Many science festivals and other public events running over multiple days placed particular emphasis on the theme of light during 2015. Such large-scale visibility brought the important messages of the year to millions. A selection of highlights gives a flavour of the diversity of such events, and illustrates also how the international aspects of IYL 2015 could be sometimes effectively linked with national themes. In New Zealand, for example, the Illuminating NZ celebration began in mid-winter to coincide with the MƒÅori New Year Matariki (heralded by the appearance of the Pleiades on the horizon) and closed with a 9-day celebration of the coming of spring: Te K≈çanga. The event programme involved thousands of participants of all ages and included art, music, and science activities. In the Philippines, a two-day public symposium IlumiNASYON from 9‚Äì16 March 2015 highlighted optics in the arts, science, and in Philippine history and culture. And in Mozambique, events in Maputo celebrating IYL 2015 were held on 10 November 2015 to coincide with celebrations of the city's founding. Many large-scale events took place in Europe during 2015. An exhibition Discover the Power of Light! organised by the Vrije Universiteit Brussel attracted 270,000 visitors to the iconic Atomium Centre in Brussels. The European Researchers' Night on 25 September 2015 in 24 countries attracted over 1.1 million visitors, and many activities used the theme of light to align with IYL 2015. One notable example is CERN's activities on light and poetry. The art festival Nuit Blanche was organized in Bratislava on 10 October 2015, and together with the Festival of Light (10-12 October 2015) attracted 100,000 people to the streets of the Slovak capital. The science festival organised by the German Physical Society (DPG) and the Federal Ministry of Research in Jena, attracted more than 53,000 visitors from 27 September-1 October 2015. The Athens Science Festival celebrated from 17‚Äì22 March 2015 chose as its main theme light and its applications, and attracted 33,000 participants, including 8,000 students. Elsewhere, the TECNOPOLIS exhibition in Argentina from July‚ÄìNovember 2015 attracted more than 700,000 visitors, and included prominent stands with experiments and art performances on the theme of light. The Light Fest event organized in Concepci√≥n (Chile) on 11 October 2015 combined the science of light, art, photography, and dance, attracting 25,000 people. In Hong Kong, the K11 art and shopping mall displayed an exhibition Supernova Xmas Luminastic from 3 November 2015 to 3 January 2016 during the crowded Christmas season. = IYL 2015 Anniversaries and History of Science = Many activities highlighted milestones in the history of science during 2015. The lives and works of Ibn Al-Haytham were the focus of the majority of such events, with activities in 27 countries. As well as individual events from IYL 2015 partners, coordinated programmes were run by 1001 Inventions in partnership with UNESCO and by the Ibn Al-Haytham International Working Group. An important two-day conference on the Islamic Golden Age of Science for the Knowledge-Based Society ran through 14‚Äì15 September 2015 at UNESCO HQ in Paris, which included an exhibition from the Qatar National Library on efforts to preserve Islamic archives and manuscripts. Many events on 25 November 2015 celebrated the 100th anniversary of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Articles in major newspapers on TV and in other media appeared around the world, and there many dedicated scientific conferences, including a three-day conference in the Philippines, \\"Project Einstein 2015: An International Conference Celebrating 100 Years of General Relativity.\\" Over the week comprising 29 May 2015, events were held on the island of Principe to celebrate the 96th anniversary of the experimental confirmation of the theory during the total solar eclipse of 1919. Maxwell and his theory of electromagnetism were a particular focus in Scotland. As well as many lectures and special events throughout the year, Maxwell's Torch, an illuminated mobile artwork created by the Institute of Physics in Scotland was used to accompany many activities, and there was a special musical composition In Time of Light created by musician PJ Moore. The work of Augustin Fresnel was showcased in a special Fresnel Lecture on 10 March 2015 held at the Royal Institution in London and organised by the Society of Light and Lighting. The event attracted 400 people and was attended by the Duke of York. Possible links between Fresnel and the development of links between art and science were discussed in a multidisciplinary event Au Prisme d'Augustin Fresnel held at the Louvre in Paris on 2 November 2015. = IYL 2015 and Astronomy = The International Astronomical Union (IAU) organized activities under the Cosmic Light banner, recognizing both the importance of light to astronomy as well as promoting the preservation of dark skies. The latter theme focuses on raising awareness of and reducing light pollution that results in more than 80% of the world's population living under light-polluted skies. Dark Sky awareness was raised through many local events, as well as the citizen-science Globe at Night programme (globeatnight.org), an international citizen scientist project to measure the degree of light pollution all around the world using the human eye, and through the development of the Quality Lighting Teaching Kit. Thousands of people around the world also participated in astronomical observation, especially during the solar eclipse on 20 March 2015 and the total lunar eclipse on 28 September 2015. Many countries and institutions held similar events under the banner of the \\"Night of the Stars\\" for public observing and one such programme on 28 November 2015 in Latin America attracted 200,000 participants. The IAU also supported over 20 national or regional outreach efforts as part of Cosmic Light during 2015. Building on developments during the 2009 International Year of Astronomy, over 10,000 Galileoscopes were distributed during 2015 to science educators in the US, Puerto Rico, and Guam, and the GalileoMobile astronomy outreach project worked with a network of 20 schools in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. In addition to the IAU-coordinated activities to recognize the start of IYL 2015 in January 2015, the Chandra X-ray Center released a set of images that combined data from telescopes tuned to different wavelengths of light. In addition to these images, the Chandra X-ray Center created the Light: Beyond the Bulb image bank. = Lighting and Architecture = The year 2015 also saw many examples of the symbolic power of light with illumination of major monuments and buildings worldwide. The opening of IYL 2015 saw the Fontenoy building at UNESCO HQ in Paris illuminated from 19‚Äì20 January 2015, and on 24 January 2015, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the old port of Valpar√≠so (Chile) saw a public event Post Tenebras Lux attracting 50,000 people. The launch of the IYL 2015 in Ireland on 13 March 2015 saw the first ever illumination in green of the Dublin Spire, and the Night of Heritage Light organised by the Society of Light & Lighting illuminated nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites across the UK on 1 October 2015. On the truly global level, the celebration of the UN's 70th anniversary on 25 October 2015 saw 300 iconic monuments worldwide lit up in the colours of UN blue. A number of other international lighting events took place 2015. The Circle of Light Moscow International Festival from 26 September - 4 October 2015 saw 10 million visitors experience lighting and projection mapping of iconic building such as the Bolshoi Theatre. Similar mapping displays included the Legenda Aurea show on 11 October 2015 on the Colosseum in Rome, and the Brandenburg Gate from 9‚Äì18 October 2015 as part of Berlin's Festival of Lights. Amongst other events, The Chinese Taipei Lantern Festival ran from 5‚Äì15 March 2015, included a special lantern featuring Einstein, and attracted more than 8 million visitors. A winter light festival Montr√©al en lumi√®re in Canada presented an array of free outdoor light-based activities integrating digital arts and interactive initiatives. To close the IYL 2015 in South Africa, two laser projection shows were shown at the V&A; Waterfront site in Cape Town, where members of the public were encouraged to \\"follow the light\\" to the source where they found an IYL 2015 stand. Running from 16‚Äì31 December 2015, an estimated 150,000 people passed through the V&A; site on New Year's Eve. Promoting light in the built environment was a special focus of the International Association of Lighting Designers (IALD). As well as hosting a special event during the LightFair conference in New York, United States of America, on 5 May 2015 that included UNESCO representation, the IALD regional chapters hosted over 100 other events in 2015. Another event on this themes was the Light Middle East conference in Dubai (United Arab Emirates) from 6‚Äì8 October 2015 that saw over 6,000 visitors from 85 different countries. IYL 2015 also saw the launch of the International VELUX Award for students of architecture to encourage and challenge students to explore the theme of daylight which by March 2016 had attracted more than 5,000 student registrations from 97 countries. Other themes involving different aspects of light and architecture linked light and gardens. The Gardens of Light project aimed to promote historic gardens and museums around the world and was part of the Festival of Light from 2‚Äì30 August 2015 at the Royal ≈Åazienki Park in Warsaw (Poland) receiving around 70,000 visitors. In the UK, a Garden of Light celebrating the IYL 2015 designed by the University of Southampton won the People's' Choice Award at the RHS Tatton Park Flower Show, which was held from 22‚Äì26 July, and was featured on the BBC Two channel. Also in the UK, the e-Luminate Wine Tasting Light Experiment took place in Cambridge on 17 February 2016 to examine the effect of lighting on the perception of the taste and aroma of wine (with red and blue light seen to have a more beneficial effect). = Art and Museums = Many artists and museums worldwide embraced IYL 2015, both through drawing attention to the International Year in the frame of their exhibits and displays, or through participation in activities organised with other partners that created new synergies between different communities. A major event in the Netherlands used technology developed for exoplanet research to project a rainbow arch on the Amsterdam Centraal railway station. Developed by Studio Roosegaarde, Leiden University, and North Carolina State University, the Rainbow Station projection ran every day in 2015 and was seen by an estimated 50 million people. In the frame of COP21 and IYL 2015, the Human Energy project allowed participants to generate power through running, dance, and cycling etc. to light up the Eiffel Tower. Another project during COP21 was Phares, a beacon of light sculpture installed at the Place de La Concorde. Elsewhere in France, the largest artistic sundial in Europe was inaugurated on 21 June 2015 to mark the Summer Solstice during IYL 2015 In Germany, the Centre for International Light Art in Unna awarded the first International Light Art Award on 22 January 2015. The event also included a scientific introduction to the main themes of IYL 2015. An exhibition Sorolla: The Art of Light ran in Madrid from 14 July 2015 to 18 January 2016 displaying works by the Spanish painter Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, analysing his techniques that gave him the reputation of \\"the painter of light.\\" During the year, the Prado Museum in Madrid also hosted a documentary where researchers linked the themes of IYL 2015 to the museum displays. In France, Au Prisme d'Augustin Fresnel was a one-day event at the Louvre in Paris on 2 November 2015 on art and the development of impressionism in the 19th Century. Light and Dark Matters was a series of events organised by the Tate Modern art gallery and Founding Partner IOP in London from 20‚Äì21 November 2015, bringing together artists, scientists, philosophers and the public to share experiences on light. The Museum of Light in Mexico City ran many events in 2015, including lectures and displays, outreach for children and teachers, and the Beyond Light exhibit prepared for the National Science Week that took place from 7‚Äì13 November 2015. The Museum of Contemporary Art Australia in Sydney ran the Light Show exhibition from 16 April-5 July 2015 and developed accompanying events for IYL 2015 including public lectures and interactive exhibits. An overlapping exhibit, Luminous, featured works by indigenous artists. A feature of events in South Africa was the inclusion of a strong art and science programme in remote regions of the country, derelict buildings, and construction sites. = Photography = Many photography contests in the framework of the IYL 2015 attracted thousands of entries from around the world. Such contests were held on the local level (e.g. in Norway and Uruguay), on the national level (India, which involved over 1,000 schools), and internationally (SPIE's IYL 2015 Photo Contest). = Literature = Light has always been a theme of inspiration for literature, and events linking light and the written word were also frequent during 2015. The UK's National Poetry Day on 8 October 2015 adopted the theme of light with the sharing of publicly submitted poems and a free book, LIGHT ‚Äì A National Poetry Day Anthology. Australia's National Science Channel RiAus organized a scientific haiku contest to reflect the National Science Week theme Making waves ‚Äì the science of light. IYL 2015 activities in Rio de Janeiro were closed with the Light for Poets series of public conferences. In the Russian Federation, the Words & Light Anthology received entries from more than 400 authors from 19 countries. = Theatre and Film = Several partners developed special theatrical shows for IYL 2015. The Amazing Theatre of Physics in the Czech Republic visited many schools with their play explaining the physics behind light. Looking for Ibn Al-Haytham was the title of a musical performed in Toledo by the IES Princesa Galiana, a Spanish high school. The student theatre group of the Universit√© de Franche-Comt√© in France ran a series of outreach events all year, including Eclats a specially written performance on light and its properties. Over 100 short videos and/or documentaries related to the theme of light or especially commissioned for IYL 2015 were released during 2015. The short film 1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham premiered at the 12th Dubai Film Festival on December 2015 and represented the last film of the late renowned Egyptian actor Omar Sharif. Einstein's Light by film maker Nickolas Barris and Leiden University described the innovative spirits of Albert Einstein and Hendrik Lorentz. Excerpts served as the official trailer for the IYL 2015 worldwide, and the premiere was held on 2 November 2015 during the Leiden International Film Festival. The French- German television channel ARTE developed a series of ten episodes called Avatars de Lumi√®re dedicated to light-based technologies. A film series commissioned by Physics World (IOP), Light in our Lives, covered applications of light and light-based technologies, with an international dimension reflecting the countries where they were produced ‚Äì the UK, India, France, Mexico, and the USA. Also in the UK, The Open University, the South East Physics Network and the Royal Astronomical Society created an animation to celebrate the anniversaries commemorated during IYL 2015. Cinema Festivals around the world also decided to align their themes with the IYL 2015, including the Science Film Festival and the IYL 2015 Film Festival. Other Festivals included: the VerCi√™ncia International Festival of Science TV in Brazil, the 2nd Ethnografilm Festival in Paris, and the CINEMISTICA 2015 Film Festival in Spain. Links to a selection of these songs are available from the IYL 2015 YouTube Channel and from the IYL 2015 website. = Music = Seven original compositions have been inspired by the IYL 2015 and have been featured in events ranging from the Opening Ceremony at UNESCO HQ to local conferences in events in over 50 countries worldwide. Bruce Adolphe composed the score for the Nickolas Barris film Einstein's Light. The violinist for the soundtrack was Joshua Bell, performing with pianist Marija Stroke. The √âcole Polytechnique and composer J√©r√¥me Musiani released Step into the Light performed by Vince McClenny. Rainbow of Light was written by Linda Lamon and sung by soprano Katerina Mina. Shine is a dedication to Ibn Al-Haytham, and features on Sami Yusuf's score for Ahmed Salim's film 1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham starring Omar Sharif. Faro de Estrellas was a song composed and arranged by the Italian duo Jalisse based on lyrics by Sandra von Borries in Spanish submitted as part of the IYL 2015 Light Song Contest. In Time of Light with words and music from PJ Moore was an electronic oratorio in celebration of James C. Maxwell. The song C'√® Luce was released as part of an IYL 2015 project in Italy by the Andare oltre si pu√≤ association which promotes societal inclusion for people with Down syndrome. Links to videos of these songs are available from the IYL 2015 YouTube Channel and from the IYL 2015 website. = Publications = Print and online publications ranging from scientific journals to newspapers and in-flight magazines released special content on the IYL 2015, permitting an extremely wide reach to the wider public. In the scientific community, IYL 2015 learned society partners released a number of special publications throughout the year to raise awareness of IYL 2015 themes and topics (e.g. APS, DPG, EPS, IOP, OSA, SFO, SFP, SPIE, and others). Other special issues include the Cuban Physical Journal and the leading Russian journal Optics and Spectroscopy. Publishers such as Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley also published special IYL 2015 issues or editorials. Nature Publishing Group and the Nature journals released articles and content that was updated throughout the IYL 2015. Nature Middle East published an interesting editorial at the end of 2015 discussing how Ibn Al-Haytham's legacy of scientific scepticism should be emulated across the Arab World. The IYL 2015 Media Partners published many special publications over the IYL 2015. The most prominent were featured in IYL 2015 Optics Bookshelf on the IYL 2015 website. Several books were released on the themes of IYL 2015; Celebrating Light and Inspired by Light: Reflections from the International Year of Light 2015 from SPIE; a children's book on Ibn Al- Haytham from 1001 Inventions and National Geographic; Kim Arcand and Megan Watzke - Light: Beyond the Bulb coordinators - presented a visual exploration of the power and behavior of light in Light: The Visible Spectrum and Beyond; and The Wonders of Light - from Marta Garc√≠a-Matos and Llu√≠s Torner also depicts the spectacular power of light. = Other commemorations = The IYL 2015 was also celebrated in many other ways combining art, science, and innovative approaches to raising awareness with the general public. The IYL 2015 logo was projected widely, including on The Globe of Science and Innovation at CERN, and was also the subject of large-scale light painting by the Light Painting World Alliance in Oviedo, Spain and on the North Sea in Germany. On a different scale altogether, a micron-scale logo was fabricated using advanced plasmonic colour laser printing technology at the Technical University of Denmark. Other innovative ways in which the IYL 2015 logo appeared was as a hologram prepared for laser pointers, inside cakes, drawn with machine vision-robotic control, and included in a special design for a reindeer- themed Christmas decoration that was placed on the Christmas Tree outside the UK Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. The IYL 2015 was celebrated in philately with stamps from 26 different countries: Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Grenada, Guyana, Israel, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Maldives, Malta, Mexico, Moldova, Montserrat, Portugal, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Sao Tom√© and Principe, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Spain, The United Kingdom, Uruguay, and Vatican City. The stamps depicted key IYL 2015 themes such as Cosmic Light (Sierra Leone), light pollution awareness (Gambia), optical phenomena (Sierra Leone), and light-based technologies (UK). The stamp from Liechtenstein included features that allowed hands-on experiments on light to be performed, and received the prestigious Red Dot design award in 2015. Other countries such as Romania issued special postmarks whilst stamps from countries such as Ghana and the Netherlands included related topics in science and lighting. San Marino and Spain also issued commemorative coins, the latter being the first official Spanish coin minted in colour. In other unexpected domains, national lottery tickets in Spain and Mexico included the IYL 2015 logo, and the International Year of Light was an inspiration to design a series of limited edition Art Label bottles for Campari.

His appointment to the role was gazetted in the British and Argentine Packet News in September 1832. The announcement led to the British consul issuing a note of protest, which other than a brief acknowledgement from Argentina went unanswered. This combined with the Lexington raid of 1831, is considered to have prompted the British to send a small naval patrol to re-assert British sovereignty in the Falkland Islands. Arriving in October 1832, he was murdered in a mutiny the following month. There are few reliably known details of his early life and even the exact circumstances of his death are unclear.  Early life  Document naming Esteban Mestivier with the rank of brevet major by Juan Manuel de Rosas in 1829. There is very little known for certain about Mestivier's life. He was French-bornPepper, 2011, pp. 368‚Äì369 but even his name is not known with certainty. The Argentine historian Paul Groussac (also of French origin) refers to him as Jean or Juan, but reflecting a custom of hispanicising Christian names he is generally referred to as Major Esteban Mestivier in Argentine literature. There are records of Mestivier serving in the campaigns against the aboriginal people in the region around Bahia Blanca. This was at the time the southern boundary of the United Provinces of South America one of the precursor states of what is now Argentina. In the 7th Cavalry he served as a First Lieutenant, was promoted to captain in 1828 and to brevet major in 1829.  Deployment to the Falklands  Following the USS Lexington raid of 1831, Luis Vernet refused to continue as military and civil commander in the Falkland Islands.Cawkell, 2001, pp. 61 President Juan Rosas conferred upon Mestivier the appointment of interim military and civil commander on 10 September 1832. This was subsequently confirmed by being gazetted in the British and Argentine Packet News on 15 September 1832. The announcement provoked a protest from the British minister in Buenos Aires, Henry Fox, on 28 September 1832, which like the protests of 1829 against Vernet's appointment, went unanswered apart from a brief acknowledgement. This, combined with the Lexington raid of 1831 prompted the British to send a naval patrol to re-assert sovereignty over the Falkland Islands.Cawkell, 2001, pp. 59 On 23 September 1832, Mestivier departed on board the ARA Sarandi commanded by Major Pinedo, accompanied by his pregnant wife and a garrison of 25 men together with their wives and children. This small garrison included criminals released from prison to serve in the army. Some of Vernet's men also took passage including William Dickson and Henry Metcalfe, Vernet's deputy Matthew Brisbane acted in the capacity of pilot for the Sarandi. On 10 October 1832, Mestivier performed a ceremony formally claiming the islands for the United Provinces.  Death  Mestivier was a harsh disciplinarian, which resulted in a mutiny against his authority. The exact circumstances of Mestivier's death are not certain. What is known is that on 21 November 1832, the Sarandi departed on patrol and on 30 November 1832 Mestivier was shot and then bayoneted to death by four of the mutineers. The historian Antonio Lastra indicates a couple who ran the bar were also murdered. The mutineers then stole horses and fled. Mestivier was buried immediately but his grave was not marked.  Aftermath  Adjutant Juan Antonio Gomila, Mestivier's second-in- command, moved into the house and announced he proposed to share a bedroom with Mestivier's widow (Gomila was later implicated in the mutiny). The crews of the British sealer Rapid and the French whaler Jean Jacques witnessed the mutiny and took action. Mestivier's widow was taken on board the Rapid. Gauchos from Vernet's settlers together with armed men from the Jean Jacques captured the mutineers near what is now known as Estancia and imprisoned them on board the Rapid. The Sarandi returned a month later and its commander Jose Pinedo took control. His investigation was interrupted on 2 January 1833 by the arrival of HMS Clio under the command of Captain Onslow. Onslow had been sent to assert British sovereignty over the islands and requested that the Sarandi and garrison leave the islands. The Sarandi and the Rapid departed on 5 January 1833 taking the mutineers to Buenos Aires. On return to Buenos Aires, the mutineers were put on trial. Seven were convicted of mutiny and condemned to death, and two others received jail sentences and a flogging. On 8 February 1833, those sentenced to death were executed by firing squad and their bodies gibbeted on the gallows for four hours. The two sentenced to prison escaped the more severe punishment by extending their service in the army. The clemency shown to Adjutant Gomila (who was exiled) was bitterly criticised by Mestivier's widow.

Established in 1979, it traces the history of the art of printing from the beginning of the 20th century until it was replaced by more rapid technologies. The collection includes a variety of equipment used to print books and newspapers, mainly from Germany and Denmark. History The members of Esbjerg typografiske Laug were themselves typographers. As they had difficulty in storing the machines they acquired, they ended up in various locations throughout Esbjerg. Prior to the opening of the museum, a composing machine and a printing press were stored in a garage in Neptunvej. The building in which the museum is housed was originally a farm produce facility built by Niels Hedegaard in 1905 for packing eggs and butter for export. In 1953, the property was purchased by I.C. Nielsen who used it as a smithy. In 1978, it was acquired by the local authority who made it available for Esbjerg typografisk Laug (Esbjerg Typographical Guild) who established the Bogtrykmuseet i Esbjerg in 1881. The Museum's supporters organization has about 700 members. Museum In the Composing Room, there are over a hundred wood and lead types. There are four fully operational type-setting machines: a Typograph, two Intertypes and a Linotype, all over a hundred years old. The Museum contains a large collection of printing types, displacing a fraction of its large collections of type cases for different font sizes from small lead and types including large carved pear-wood type, as well as composing tools and composing sticks. The Printing Room houses a collection from the Eickhoff factory in Copenhagen which was active from the 1890s until the mid-20th century.

She was defeated after three terms by Republican candidate Shea Dobson in the June 6, 2017 election. First elected to the position in 2005, Moran served three terms as mayor of the city. She was re-elected in 2009 and 2013, winning 62% of the vote in the latter year. Moran has served as president of Moran Consultants, a firm providing marketing and development service. She also served for three years as director of Jackson County Economic Development, and for five years before that as managing director of the State of Mississippi European Office in Frankfurt, Germany, where she recruited new business to the state. Early life Moran was born May 18, 1956, and was adopted as a child. Moran is a native of Ocean Springs. Moran's family has been in business in Ocean Springs for over 140 years. Her grandfather, A. P. \\"Fred\\" Moran, was a county supervisor for 40 years, and her father, John Duncan Moran, was a city alderman. Education Moran graduated from Georgetown University with bachelor's and master's degrees in finance/economics and international commerce. She graduated cum laude. Moran conducted graduate research at the Institute of World Economics in Germany as a Fulbright Scholar. She was also an economist at the World Trade Organization in Geneva. She is a former Robert Bosch Foundation Fellow, where she worked for the German Ministry of France. In 2006, she was selected to be the Bosch Alumna of the Year for her leadership in Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. Political career=Mayorship Moran was elected mayor of Ocean Springs in 2005. She was re-elected in 2009 and 2013. She was defeated in her re- election bid by Republican challenger Shea Dobson on June 6, 2017. =Hurricane Katrina= Mayor Connie Moran talks with First Lady Laura Bush during a tour of Katrina Cottages, the quaint, colorful, and quickly built cottages for post-Katrina living. Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast six weeks after Moran took office as mayor in 2005. When Katrina destroyed 150 miles of coastline on August 29, 2005, Ocean Spring's waterfront was devastated, but the historic downtown suffered no storm surge, and the damage was limited to roofs, windows and storefronts. Moran drew on her background as an economic development expert to develop a plan to rebuild the city, structurally and economically, while trying to retain the city's historical value and contain urban sprawl while still advocating for growth. The mayor first gained national attention when she locked horns with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Moran preferred \\"Katrina Cottages\\" to standard-issue mobile homes, which would likely not be used as permanent housing. Moran said she wanted to be sure one of the oldest French colonies in the country (Ocean Springs was founded in 1699) maintained an element of traditionalism even as it recovered from the storm. FEMA allocated almost $400 million to bring in the alternate structures. First Lady Laura Bush toured Ocean Springs and the Katrina Cottages with Moran in February 2007. Treasurer campaign Moran ran for Mississippi State Treasurer in 2011. She received the Democratic Party nomination, but was defeated by Republican candidate Lynn Fitch in the general election. Public Service Commissioner Campaign Moran ran for PSC in the Southern District in 2019, and won the Democratic Nomination with 78.3% of the vote. She faced Dane Maxwell, Mayor of Pascagoula in the General Election and lost. Personal life Moran married Arnold W. \\"Jack\\" Rosen in October 2014. Moran has one daughter, Magdeleine, born in 1995, who has cerebral palsy and autism. Moran is a Catholic; her official biography describes her as a \\"lifelong member\\" of St. Alphonsus Catholic Church. Moran, who was adopted, met her birth mother for the first time in 2005. Moran is active in civic and charitable organizations, and has served as a board director for Jackson County United Way, YMCA, and Boys and Girls Clubs. She is a member of Rotary International, the Gulf Coast Business Council, and served on the National Board of Directors for the Congress on New Urbanism. She has also served on the Jackson County Port Authority of Commissioners, the Board of Trustees of the Walter Anderson Museum of Art, and the Governor's Commission on Developmental Disabilities. On January 13, 2020, according to the Jackson County jail docket posted online, she was charged with one misdemeanor count of being drunk in public. A bond was set at $263.

Bing Crosby's first television special, it was directed by Fred de Cordova, it originally aired in the United States on January 3, 1954. Guest stars included Jack Benny and Sheree North, with Ken Carpenter as the announcer. Background Bing Crosby was slow to become involved in television, unlike rivals such as Perry Como and Frank Sinatra. Bob Hope too was another who embraced the medium early on. Eventually Bing took the plunge and began filming his first ‚Äúspecial‚Äù in December 1953 for CBS-TV on Stage Three of the General Service Studios in Hollywood. General Electric were the sponsors. Interviewed by Newsweek at the time Crosby said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always felt television is just like movies, but it‚Äôs in the home. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be in anybody‚Äôs home too often, and you wouldn‚Äôt want to see a movie starring the same person every week.‚Äù The 30-minute show was transmitted on January 3, 1954 and was preceded by a major publicity drive. The show The show opened with Bing welcoming the viewers and then going into a dance routine as he sang ‚ÄúY‚Äôall Come‚Äù. He then segued in to a song ‚Äì ‚ÄúIt Had to be You‚Äù ‚Äì accompanied only by Buddy Cole on the piano. The next scene showed visitors touring the television studio and being joined by Jack Benny who is escorting Sheree North. Jack is concerned about Crosby being nervous and when he joins Bing, he tries to calm him down despite Crosby obviously being utterly relaxed. Bing then sings ‚ÄúChanging Partners‚Äù and is followed by Sheree North doing a raunchy burlesque dance which drew some press criticism. To conclude the show Bing sings ‚ÄúI Love Paris‚Äù against a city rooftop backdrop and is joined by Barbara Logan who purports to be walking through the city on her way to Ohrbach's for a fashion show. Reception Critics generally liked the show with Daily Variety saying: ‚ÄúThat old charmer, head of the Crosby clan, finally showed his face around television. On his own show, that is. The millions who made up the vast welcoming committee must‚Äôve shared the same thought - he was well worth sticking around for. One word description of his coming out party: Socko!‚Äù Others were less enthusiastic with Billboard stating ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to believe that the show was produced by the same men responsible for his delightfully informal radio airers.‚Äù Some would have preferred a ‚Äúlive‚Äù Crosby instead of the filmed version. The Los Angeles Times was unhappy with the use of a laugh-track. Crosby filmed another special for General Electric which was shown in April 1954 and he then virtually avoided television until 1957.

Once a Puritan stronghold, Boston changed dramatically in the 19th century with the arrival of European immigrants. The Irish dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period, especially following the Great Irish Famine. Their arrival transformed Boston from an Anglo-Saxon, Protestant city into one that has become progressively more diverse. The Yankees hired Irish as workers and servants, but there was little social interaction. In the 1840s and 50s, the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant Know Nothing movement targeted Irish Catholics in Boston. In the 1860s, many Irish immigrants fought for the Union in the American Civil War, and that display of patriotism helped to dispel much of the prejudice against them. With an expanding population, group loyalty, and block-by-block political organization, the Irish took political control of the city, leaving the Yankees in charge of finance, business, and higher education. The Irish left their mark on the region in a number of ways: in still heavily Irish neighborhoods such as Charlestown and South Boston; in the name of the local basketball team, the Boston Celtics; in the iconic Irish- American political family, the Kennedys; in a large number of prominent local politicians, such as James Michael Curley; and in the establishment of Catholic Boston College as a rival to Harvard. History=Early America The Irish have been in Boston since colonial times, when they arrived as indentured servants, merchants, sailors, or tradesmen. According to historian James Cullen, a large number of Irish immigrants arrived as early as 1654, on the ship Goodfellow, and were \\"sold\\" into indentured servitude \\"to such of the inhabitants as needed them.\\"Cullen (1889), p. 23. Most of the early arrivals were Presbyterians from Ulster who came seeking relief from high rents, repressive taxes, and other pressures. Wary of Boston's Anglo-Saxon Puritans, who were hostile to the Irish, many moved to the outer fringes of the Bay Colony and founded towns such as Bangor and Belfast in Maine, and Londonderry and Derry in New Hampshire. The few Irish Catholics who settled in the Boston area had to convert or hide their identity, since Catholicism was outlawed.O'Connor (1995), p. 3-5 Other Irish immigrants may have come to Boston involuntarily, after being kidnapped by pirates.Cullen (1889), p. 24. The Boston News-Letter announced an auction of Irish boys in 1730, and women convicts deported from Belfast were sold in Boston in 1749.Byrne (2008) p. 551. Conflation of such immigrants, indentures, and convicts has given rise to the Irish slaves myth. On March 17, 1737, after a particularly harsh winter, a group of Irish Protestants met in Boston to organize the Charitable Irish Society. Its mission was to provide loans and other assistance to Irish immigrants who were elderly, sick, or in need. The gathering was the first known observance of St. Patrick's Day in the Thirteen Colonies. Still in existence, the society is the oldest Irish organization in North America.Quinlin (2013), pp. 7-8. Once the Irish had proved their loyalty by fighting in the American Revolutionary War, they were more welcome in Boston and better able to assimilate--provided, of course, that they were Protestants. According to historian Michael J. O'Brien, hundreds of Irish Americans fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill.O'Brien (1919), pp. 210, 224. One son of Irish immigrants, John Sullivan, served under George Washington and became a brigadier general. According to local legend, Sullivan used \\"Saint Patrick\\" as the official password when he led Colonial troops into town following the British evacuation of Boston in 1776. Boston still celebrates the event each year on Evacuation Day, which coincides with Saint Patrick's Day. Sullivan's brother, James Sullivan, was elected governor of Massachusetts in 1807.O'Connor (1995), pp. 12-13. 19th century Constitution Wharf, Boston, 1857 A wave of Irish immigration to Boston started in the 1820s. Initially most of the newcomers were Protestants, but increasingly they were joined by Catholics. From the start, there were problems. The \\"papists\\" were seen as both a spiritual and a political threat, and the locals reacted accordingly. Gangs of militant Protestants roamed the streets of Irish neighborhoods, damaging property and even destroying several houses. Preachers railed from the pulpit against the \\"blasphemy\\" and \\"idolatry\\" of Roman Catholicism, and local newspapers fanned the flames by printing anti-Catholic propaganda, filled with wild conspiracy theories about the Jesuits.O'Connor (1995), pp. 43-45. On July 11, 1837, a company of Yankee firemen returning from a call met with an Irish funeral procession on Broad Street. What started as a street brawl escalated into an all-out riot when a fireman sounded the emergency alarm, summoning all of the fire engines in Boston. Local Yankee and Irish Americans came running to join the fight, bearing sticks, stones, bricks, and cudgels. Some 800 men were involved in the actual fighting and at least 10,000 gathered in the street to cheer them on. The riot ended when the mayor called in the National Lancers and the state militia. Remarkably, no one was killed. Three Irishmen, and none of the firemen, received jail sentences. The incident became known as the Broad Street Riot.O'Connor (1995), pp. 48-49. =Famine years= Boston Irish Famine Memorial The Port of Boston was a major center of immigration during the Great Irish Famine (1845‚Äì1852). By 1850, the Irish were the largest ethnic group in Boston. Most of the immigrants during this period were poor, unskilled laborers from rural backgrounds who settled in the slums of the North End, the South Cove, and Fort Hill. Many were not only destitute but weakened by typhus contracted on the coffin ships that had brought them. To contain the health risk, a quarantine hospital and almshouse were built on Deer Island, where hundreds of immigrants died and were buried in unmarked graves. To make matters worse, a cholera epidemic swept through Boston in 1849. The North End poor, living in crowded, unsanitary conditions on the waterfront, were the hardest hit; over 500 Irish were killed.Ryan (1979), pp. 2-3. Boston health inspectors described a typical Irish slum as \\"a perfect hive of human beings, without comforts and mostly without common necessaries; in many cases huddled together like brutes, without regard to age or sex or sense of decency.\\" Many Irish women became domestic servants; by 1860, two-thirds of the servants in Boston were Irish.Byrne (2008) p. 552. Most Irish men worked in construction, in quarries, or on the docks. Irish laborers helped build up the business district behind Faneuil Hall, built townhouses on Beacon Hill, cleared land for North Station, and filled in the South End; others worked on the waterfront as fish cutters and stevedores.O'Connor (1995), p. 37. A notable exception was Andrew Carney. Born into poverty in County Cavan, Ireland, he trained as a tailor's apprentice, then moved to Boston in 1816 and opened a successful tailoring business. Carney & Sleeper, Clothier, was one of the first shops to offer \\"ready-made\\" suits. After selling the business, Carney retired from tailoring and went on to a career in finance and a legacy of philanthropy. He co-founded the First National Bank of Boston and the John Hancock Insurance Company; funded the Church of the Immaculate Conception in the South End, and several Catholic orphanages; helped found Boston College; and in 1863 founded Carney Hospital, where, he insisted, \\"the sick without distinction of creed, color or nation shall be received and cared for.\\" This policy was relatively enlightened at a time when Boston City Hospital was refusing to admit Jewish patients.Ryan (1979), p. 165. Another influential figure was Thomas F. Ring, president of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Catholic Union of Boston. A Boston native of Irish descent, Ring worked for his family's paper export business and was a leading member of several charitable organizations. Ring was also involved in the founding, in 1870, of the Union Institution for Savings, which provided loans to Catholics who were turned away by other banks.Cullen (1889), pp. 403-404. Other successful Irish businessmen included Christopher Blake, who started a large furniture factory in Dorchester; Patrick Maguire, founder of The Republic, a weekly political journal; and Dennis Hern, founder of a telegram service that employed 400 messengers.Cullen (1889), pp. 408-409, 413, 419. The Boston Irish Famine Memorial was erected at the corner of Washington and School Streets, on the Freedom Trail, in 1998. One bronze sculpture depicts a starving woman, looking up to the heavens as if to ask \\"Why?\\", while her children cling to her. A second sculpture shows the figures hopeful as they land in Boston. =The Know Nothings= Nativist, anti-Catholic paper published in Boston ca. 1854 In the 1840s and 50s, increasing nativist and anti-Catholic sentiment gave rise to the Know Nothing movement, formally known as the American Party. The Know Nothings gained a large following in Boston with their program of \\"Temperance, Liberty, and Protestantism\\". In 1847 they held a mass rally in the crowded Irish neighborhood of Fort Hill; residents, forewarned by the clergy and urged to keep the peace, stayed indoors that day.Cullen (1889), pp. 74-75. In 1854 the Know Nothings took control of the Massachusetts legislature.O'Connor (1995), p. 76. Among other things, they passed laws barring Catholics from being buried in public cemeteries, denying church officials any control over church property, and requiring children to read from the Protestant Bible (the King James Version) in public schools. They formed a Nunnery Committee that raided Catholic schools and convents on trumped-up pretexts.O'Connor (1995), pp. 77, 80. The Boston Police Department's first Irish officer, Barney McGinniskin, was fired that year without cause, and on Independence Day, the newly constructed St. Gregory's Church in Dorchester was burned to the ground by Know Nothing rioters. In Boston's public schools, Catholic children were required to say Protestant prayers and sing Protestant hymns, and their history books were written from an anti-Catholic point of view.O'Connor (1995), p. 80. In 1859, a Catholic boy who refused to recite the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments was severely beaten, leading to the Eliot School Rebellion. Over 300 boys withdrew from the school, prompting St. Mary's Parish to create a primary school to educate them.Ryan (1979), p. 59. =Civil War= Massachusetts 9th Regiment at Camp Cass, Virginia, 1861 Although Boston was an important center of abolitionism, most Irish immigrants were strongly opposed to blacks and to abolitionists. Historian Brian Kelly says, \\"Though they were neither consistent stalwarts of the northern war effort nor pure-and-simple dupes of the slavocracy, the Irish were capable both of ardent support and sacrifices for the Union cause and of vicious hatred for the \\"n*****s\\" and his/her abolitionist sympathizers.\\"Brian Kelly, \\"Ambiguous Loyalties: The Boston Irish, Slavery, and the Civil War.\\" Historical Journal of Massachusetts 24.2 (1996): 165+, quoting p 168. online Many fought for the Union, including Colonel Thomas Cass, who commanded an Irish regiment, the Fighting Ninth; and Patrick Robert Guiney, who fought in over thirty engagements. Sister Mary Anthony O'Connell served as a nurse on the front lines, where she was known as the \\"Angel of the Battlefield\\". Irish Bostonians also contributed to the war effort by working in the Watertown arsenal and the iron foundries of South Boston, or in the shipyards, building warships for the navy. There was some resistance to the draft in 1863, but nothing like the New York City draft riots. The critical factor among the Irish, according to Kelly, was the powerful role of the Catholic Church. He states: :The basic conservatism of the Catholic hierarchy, which had previously led it to attack abolitionists for challenging the existing social order was, after Sumter, turned against the Confederacy....Lay Catholics, according to the Church, were to answer the Union call to arms, not out of anti-slavery zeal, but out of \\"loyal submission to legitimate rule.\\"Kelly, p 191. By 1870, Boston had 250,000 residents, 56,900 of whom were Irish.Byrne (2008), p. 552. Around this time several powerful Irish ward bosses appeared on the scene, including Martin Lomasney in the West End, John F. Fitzgerald in the North End, and P. J. Kennedy in East Boston.O'Connor (1995), p. 290. Though often depicted as ruthless and corrupt, ward bosses provided much-needed aid to their neighbors. As Lomasney put it, \\"The great mass of people are interested in only three things--food, clothing, and shelter. A politician in a district like mine sees to it that his people get these things.\\" This approach to politics, known as the patronage system, helped the Irish climb out of poverty. Early in Lomasney's career, he and his brother Joseph founded the Hendricks Club. The Hendricks began as a social club and gathering place, but later turned into the center of Lomasney's political machine. It was from here that he began to provide social services, charity, and shelter for poor immigrants. In return, he was able to drum up votes and support for candidates of his choosing. Partly through his influence, Boston elected its first Irish mayor, Hugh O'Brien, in 1884.O'Connor (1995), pp. 119, 121-122, 141. As Irish Americans began to gain political power, there was a resurgence of anti-Catholic nativism. Groups such as the American Protective Association (APA), the Immigration Restriction League, and Loyal Women of American Liberty were active in Boston.O'Connor (1995), pp. 153, 156. The APA introduced legislation aimed at disaccrediting local Catholic schools, while other groups focused on purging Catholics from the School Committee. Area Catholics responded by founding as many Catholic schools (such as St. Augustine's in South Boston, founded in 1895) as their limited resources allowed.Ryan (1979), pp. 60-65. By the end of the century, the city's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants; the Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown.Whyte (1939), p. 631. 20th century Margaret Foley (right) and another suffragist distribute the Woman's Journal, 1913 In the early 20th century, Boston's Irish Americans were successful in Democratic Party politics and the labor movement, yet were relatively slow to break into business and the professions. This was only partly due to discrimination against them, although that was certainly a factor. For cultural reasons, they gravitated to modest positions offering job security and pensions rather than high-risk business ventures. Many became schoolteachers, police officers, firefighters, nurses, librarians, custodians, and clerks. Historian Dennis P. Ryan calls them \\"occupationally nearsighted\\".O'Connor (1995), pp. 223-224; Ryan (1979), p. 80. Few Irish women in Boston were active in the suffrage movement, which was dominated by upper- class women. Margaret Foley of Dorchester was a rare exception. Known for confronting anti-suffrage candidates at political rallies, she was nicknamed the \\"Grand Heckler\\". Most working-class women were more interested in labor issues: Mary Kenney O'Sullivan helped found the Women's Trade Union League in 1903, and was a leader of the Lawrence textile strike in 1912; Julia O'Connor led a successful telephone operators' strike in 1919 that paralyzed telephone service across New England for six days. That same year, the Boston Police went on strike for better wages and working conditions. Most of the officers who subsequently lost their jobs were Irish Catholics, while most of those who condemned the strikers were \\"old-line Protestant Yankees\\". Many of the strikebreakers were students at Harvard University.O'Connor (1995), p. 192. During this period the Irish often clashed with Italians, despite the fact that the vast majority of both groups shared a common religion and political party. Thousands of Irish immigrants who had settled in Boston's North End in the 19th century, displacing the Yankee residents, were crowded out by Italians in the early 20th century. The two groups were in competition for jobs as well as housing, and there were cultural differences, including different styles of Catholic worship, that caused additional friction. For a time, in some Irish parishes, Italians were forced to attend Mass in the basement.Ryan (1979), pp. 169-171; Whyte (1939) pp. 626, 629 =Leading politicians= The most prominent figure in Boston politics early in the 20th century was John F. Fitzgerald, a man so well known for his charming personality that he was nicknamed \\"Honey Fitz\\". During his two terms as mayor, Fitzgerald made major improvements to the Port of Boston, an investment that brought increased traffic from Europe. Perhaps more significantly, in his later years he taught his grandchildren how to succeed in politics. One of them, John F. Kennedy, would go on to become the 35th president of the United States. Fitzgerald was succeeded as mayor by another charismatic Irish American, James Michael Curley. Fatherless at the age of ten, Curley left school to help support his family while his mother scrubbed floors in downtown office buildings. He had a natural flair for public speaking, which he deliberately honed, studying the speeches of famous orators in the Boston Public Library. By 1900 he was Boston's youngest ward boss. He went on to serve three terms in Congress, four terms as mayor, and a term as Governor of Massachusetts. He also spent time in prison for fraud. The city's elites saw him as unforgivably corrupt, but he was well loved by Boston's poor. During the Great Depression, he enlarged Boston City Hospital, expanded the subway system, funded projects to improve the roads and bridges, and improved the neighborhoods with beaches and bathhouses, playgrounds and parks, public schools and libraries. Among the many local legends about Curley, perhaps the most telling is his ordering long-handled mops for the cleaning women at City Hall so they would not have to be on their knees.O'Connor (1995), pp. 179-195, 204-205 According to City Councilman Fred Langone, Curley was more popular with the newer immigrants, such as Italians and Jews, than he was with the lace curtain Irish of Jamaica Plain, West Roxbury, and Hyde Park.Langone (1994), p. 8. Historian James M. O'Toole has argued: :Surely there has been no more flamboyant political personality than James Michael Curley, who dominated politics in Boston for half a century. Whether as incumbent or as candidate, he was always there: alderman, congressman, mayor, governor. People loved him or hated him, but they could not ignore him. He mastered the politics of ethnic and class warfare by defining a manichaean world of \\"us\\" versus \\"them\\"....He presided over state and city during the challenge of the Depression, leaving behind impressive monuments in stone and public works. In the end, he even managed to enter American political mythology, remembered as much in his fictional incarnations as for his real life.James M. O'Toole. \\"Review\\" in The New England Quarterly 66#3 (1993) pp. 500-502 Urban historian Kenneth T. Jackson has argued that: :Curley was among the best-known and most colorful of the big-city, paternalistic bosses, Irish, Catholic, and Democratic....Capitalizing on Irish-American resentment against the Republican, Harvard-educated Brahmans who dominated Boston's social and economic life, Curley like to think of himself as \\"Mayor of the Poor\\"....Curley helped immigrants to adjust to urban life by finding them jobs, easing their troubles with the law, building them playgrounds and public baths, and attending their weddings and wakes.... Because his feuds with fellow Irish chieftains like John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, Patrick Kennedy, and Martin Lomasney were legendary, he tried as mayor to centralize patronage and make the ward healer obsolete. During the depression he used federal relief and work projects as a tool of his political ambitions. But Curley never built a really solid organization in Boston and never enjoyed the power or statewide influence of other well-known urban bosses. Kenneth T. Jackson, \\"Curley, James Michael,\\" in John A. Garraty, ed., Encyclopedia of American Biography (1974) pp 246-247. =Depression and World War II= During World War II, there was an outbreak of antisemitic violence in Boston. Jewish residents, businesses, and synagogues were frequent targets of what would now be called hate crimes: gangs of mostly Irish Catholic youths, incited by Father Coughlin and the Christian Front, roamed the streets of Jewish neighborhoods, vandalizing property and assaulting residents. Several victims were seriously injured with blackjacks and brass knuckles. Boston's predominantly Irish police, politicians, and clergy were of little help, and the local press largely ignored the problem.Norwood (2003), p. 233; O'Connor (1995), p. 204. Mayor Curley once proudly proclaimed Boston \\"the strongest Coughlin city in the world.\\" Another Irish Catholic, Frances Sweeney, led protests against the Christian Front and similar groups.Currier (1944), p. 427. Despite Coughlin's popularity with Boston's Irish Catholics, South Boston residents overwhelmingly voted against William Lemke, Coughlin's candidate in the 1936 presidential election.Stack, quoted in O'Connor (1981), p. 650. =Exodus to the suburbs= Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, ca. 1984. Boston's politics changed after the war. New Deal legislation and federal programs such as the G.I. Bill made the local patronage system obsolete. Mayor John Hynes got along better with business leaders than Curley had, while Cardinal Cushing reached out to other religious communities. The election of president John F. Kennedy was a source of great pride to Boston's Irish Americans, and marked a turning point in their \\"political consciousness\\". A succession of Irish mayors--Hynes, John F. Collins, and Kevin White--pushed urban renewal projects that contributed to gentrification. As immigrant families assimilated and their children moved to the suburbs, Boston's neighborhoods began to lose their ethnic identities.O'Connor (1995), pp. 212, 216, 226-227. Irish Americans in Boston responded with alarm to news reports of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, some raising funds for the Provisional Irish Republican Army. IRA supporters in the U.S. tended to be politically far to the right of the IRA members themselves. In the early 1970s Bernadette Devlin offended IRA supporters in Boston when she said she felt more comfortable with black people in Roxbury than she did with the Irish in South Boston. Boston's Irish Catholics tended to be socially conservative, with little interest in the civil rights, anti-Vietnam War, and feminist movements.O'Connor (1995), p. 293. In the 1970s, many of Boston's Irish- American residents became embroiled in the busing controversy. To combat the de facto segregation of Boston's public schools, federal judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. ruled that students must be bused between predominantly white and black areas of the city. South Boston High School was the site of many of the most vocal and violent protests. Senator Ted Kennedy supported Garrity's ruling, while Ray Flynn, then serving on the state legislature representing South Boston, opposed it. The plan ultimately led to an increase in the dropout rate and a wave of white flight to the suburbs and private schools. Meanwhile, local crime boss Whitey Bulger took advantage of the chaos and tightened his grip on South Boston. Irish American public figures were prominent on both sides of the issue, and surveys during the 1960s and 1970s found Irish Americans divided on the issue. Although many Irish Americans opposed busing, as a group they were more sympathetic to the aims of the civil rights movement than most other white ethnic groups in the country.Meagher (2007), pp. 638-639. In 1992, the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston (GLIB) was barred from marching in the city-sponsored St. Patrick's Day parade in South Boston. The group filed suit, and the case made it as far as the Supreme Court, which ruled against them in 1995. 21st century The Irish no longer dominate Boston politics as they once did, nor are they reliably Democratic. Many became Reagan Democrats in the 1980s. However, in Massachusetts and elsewhere in Southern New England, significant majorities of the local Irish stayed with the Democratic party.Meagher (2007), p. 632. This differs from other areas like metropolitan New York and Illinois where the Irish vote barely differs from the general white vote, and some heavily Irish small towns in Northern New England where it is quite Republican, but is similar to some other places like Gloucester, New Jersey and Butte, Montana which retain strongly liberal and Democratic-leaning Irish populations. The voting intentions of Irish Americans and other white ethnic groups attracted attention in the 2016 US election. In the Democratic primaries, Boston's Irish were said to break strongly for Hillary Clinton, whose victories in Irish-heavy Boston suburbs may have helped her narrowly carry the state over Bernie Sanders. A 2016 March survey by Irish Central showed that 45% of Irish Americans nationwide supported Trump, although the majority of those in Massachusetts supported Hillary Clinton. The presence of supporters of Trump among Irish and Italian communities which had once themselves been marginalized immigrants generated controversy, with Irish American and Italian American politicians and journalists admonishing their co-ethnics against \\"myopia\\" and \\"amnesia\\". An October poll by Buzzfeed showed that Irish respondents nationwide split nearly evenly between Trump (40%) and Clinton (39%), with large numbers either undecided or supporting other candidates (21%), and that the Irish were more supportive of Clinton than other West European-descended Americans including fellow Catholic Italian Americans. In early November 2016, six days before the election, another poll by IrishCentral showed Clinton ahead at 52% among Irish Americans, while Trump was at 40% and the third party candidates together had 8%; Irish respondents in Massachusetts similarly favored Clinton by majority. In the official 2016 election results, Irish-heavy Boston suburbs including on the South Shore witnessed swings to the left (Scituate: +19.5% D, Cohasset: +32.8% D, Milton: +26.6% D, etc.) even as the country as a whole moved right. This caused many of the most heavily Irish-descended communities in the country, such as Scituate, to flip from split or Republican-voting to Democrat-voting by significant margins (Scituate: +18% D, Hull: +21% D, Cohasset: +24% D, Milton: +41% D). Despite voting against Trump, many of these same communities had some of the highest levels of opposition to the legalization of marijuana, a typically socially conservative position. The Catholic Church no longer has as much influence as it once did over Irish Americans in Boston.O'Connor (1995), p. 298. Boston has not entirely lost its regional Irish identity: the city remains a popular destination for Irish immigrants, students, and businesses. South Boston still holds an annual St. Patrick's Day parade, Boston College offers an Irish Studies program, and organizations such as the Irish Cultural Centre help to maintain a connection with Ireland.Byrne (2008), p. 107. In 2013, Boston elected a first-generation Irish-American mayor, Marty Walsh. Culture=Religion St. Patrick's Day Parade in South Boston. The vast majority of the Irish immigrants who arrived in Boston in the 19th century were Roman Catholic. The Catholic Church with its tradition of pastoral care played an especially important role in the lives of the poor. While Protestant and secular charitable organizations offered various forms of assistance, they often discriminated or proselytized. To avoid this, Catholics built orphanages (the St. Vincent Female Orphan Asylum and the Home for Destitute Catholic Children), homes for wayward teens (House of the Angel Guardian and House of the Good Shepherd), a foundling home (St. Mary's Infant Asylum), two homeless shelters (Working Boys Home and Working Girls' Home), and a Catholic hospital (Carney Hospital). The Catholic St. Vincent de Paul Society offered food, shelter, clothing, and counseling. One parish, St. Francis de Sales in Charlestown, issued food stamps.Ryan (1979) pp. 4-13. In response to bias and proselytism in Protestant-dominated schools, Boston's Irish Catholics built Catholic schools. By 1917, they had established 29 elementary schools, four high schools, four academies, and one college (Boston College).Ryan (1979), p. 77. The first New England native to be ordained to the Catholic priesthood was John Thayer, a Boston-born Congregationalist minister who converted to Catholicism in 1783. Thayer started the first Catholic congregation in Boston in 1790, ministering to French and Irish immigrants; eventually he moved to Limerick, Ireland, where he lived the rest of his life. The first church built in Boston for Catholics was the Holy Cross Church on Franklin Street, designed by Charles Bulfinch and built in 1803; it was demolished in 1862 and replaced by the Holy Cross Cathedral. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston was established in 1808 by Pope Pius VII. The Boston-born John Bernard Fitzpatrick, son of immigrants from King's County, Ireland, became the first Irish-American Bishop of Boston in 1846. Irish Americans would eventually dominate the Catholic Church in Boston. Prominent figures include Cardinal O'Connell, Cardinal Cushing, and Archbishop Williams. In 2002, Irish-American and other Catholics were shaken by the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston. The Boston Globe's coverage of a series of criminal prosecutions of five local priests drew national attention to the issue of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy and subsequent cover-ups by the church hierarchy. The Globe investigation was dramatized in Tom McCarthy's film Spotlight in 2015. Media The Pilot, founded in 1829, is the official newspaper of the Archdiocese of Boston. The paper was founded by Bishop Benedict Joseph Fenwick, the second bishop of Boston, at a time of increased Irish immigration to the United States. It featured a \\"missing friends\\" section and kept immigrants apprised of news from Ireland.Byrne (2008), p. 106. Early editors included Patrick Donahoe and John Boyle O'Reilly. The Boston Irish Reporter, founded in 1990, is an Irish- American monthly newspaper owned and operated by Boston Neighborhood News, Inc., of Dorchester. Arts and entertainment Logo of the Boston Celtics basketball team In the mid-20th century, when Roxbury was still an Irish neighborhood, thousands of Bostonians regularly flocked to dance halls in then-Dudley Square (now Nubian Square)--the Dudley Street Opera House, Hibernian Hall, the Intercolonial, the Rose Croix, and Winslow Hall--to socialize and enjoy traditional Irish music.Gedutis (2005), p. 11. The dance halls have closed, but the influence of Irish music in Boston has continued. Accordionist Joe Derrane was inducted into the Comhaltas Ceolt√≥ir√≠ √âireann Hall of Fame in 1998 for his contribution to Irish traditional music. A number of Celtic punk bands, such as Dropkick Murphys, originated in Boston. BCMFest, Boston's annual week-long Celtic Music Festival, features local musicians of Irish, Scottish, and other Celtic traditions, and many Boston pubs, such as the Black Rose on State Street, regularly feature live Irish music. Boston hosted the 43rd World Irish Dancing Championships in 2013. Edwin O'Connor's best-selling 1956 novel, The Last Hurrah, is set in an unnamed city, widely assumed to be Boston; its main character, Frank Skeffington, is likely based on James Michael Curley. A film adaptation, directed by John Ford and starring Spencer Tracy, was released in 1958. Films with a Boston Irish focus include Good Will Hunting (1997), The Boondock Saints (1999), Mystic River (2003), The Departed (2006), Gone Baby Gone (2007), The Town (2010), Spotlight (2015), and Black Mass (2015). Boston Accent Trailer, a faux-movie trailer that first appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers in 2016, parodies the clich√©s of the genre. Documentaries include The Greening of Southie (2008), a film about the development of the Macallen Building, Boston's first green (Gold LEED certified) residence; The Irish in America (1998), a PBS special which includes a segment on Boston; Hungering for A New Life: The Potato Famine and the Irish Immigration to Boston (2014), a two-part special produced by WGBH- TV; and Clear the Floor! The Story of Irish Music in Boston (2015), produced by Newstalk. Rugby is popular with the Irish community in Boston. The Boston Irish Wolfhounds, a rugby union team, was founded in 1989, and the Boston Thirteens, a semi-professional rugby league football team, was founded in 2009. Boston also takes part in hurling and Gaelic football competitions organized by the Gaelic Athletic Association. In other sports, Irish Bostonians in the early 20th century founded the Royal Rooters, a Boston Red Sox fan club which evolved into Red Sox Nation; and \\"Lucky the Leprechaun\\", mascot of the Boston Celtics, is a nod to Boston's historically large Irish population. Discrimination and stereotyping This advertisement for a nanny, warning that \\"positively no Irish need apply\\", appeared in the Boston Transcript in 1868. Irish immigrants to the U.S. in the 19th century faced a combination of anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, and specifically anti-Irish bigotry which were closely intertwined. This was especially true in Puritan- founded Boston, with its strongly Anglo-Saxon population. Generations of Bostonians celebrated Pope's Night on November 5 each year, holding anti- Catholic parades and burning the pope in effigy.O'Connor (1995), pp. xv, 16, 94. In cases of simple anti-Catholic bigotry, other ethnic groups were also affected: for example, the nuns who lived in the Ursuline convent in Charlestown, which was burned down by anti-Catholic rioters in 1834, were French Canadians. As Cardinal Cushing wrote, however, not all the hostility hurled at Irish immigrants was hurled at them as Catholics; \\"some of it was a new chapter in the old quarrels between England and Ireland.\\" This makes it difficult in some cases to say which form of bias was most in evidence. In 1806, for example, two Irish Catholics from Boston, Dominic Daley and James Halligan, were convicted of murder on flimsy evidence and hanged; and while it is generally agreed that the jury was biased against them, it is impossible to say whether French Catholics in their position, or any outsiders for that matter, would have suffered the same fate. Governor Michael Dukakis officially exonerated both men on St. Patrick's Day, 1984. In 1837, the same year as the Broad Street Riot, Irish Bostonians formed their own volunteer militia company, one of ten that made up the infantry regiment of the Boston Brigade. The Montgomery Guards were named for Richard Montgomery, an Irish-born general who served in the Continental Army; their emblem depicted an American eagle alighting on an Irish harp. Their efforts had the blessing of city officials and the governor, and the local press applauded their public spirit. After the annual Fall Muster on Boston Common, however, when the green-clad Montgomery Guards marched across town to their armory at Dock Square, hostile crowds pelted them with bottles and rocks, and thousands of rioters surrounded the armory, threatening to break down the doors. The company was forced to disband for public safety reasons.O'Connor (1995), pp. 49-52. The Irish who arrived during the famine years were among the poorest and least welcome immigrants in Boston. In 1850, a group of African Americans living on Elm Street signed a petition to keep the Irish out of their neighborhood.Ryan (1979), p. 150. Advertisements for domestic servants sometimes stipulated \\"a Protestant woman\\", implying that an Irish Protestant would be acceptable; others specifically warned, \\"no Irish need apply\\".See \\"No Irish Need Apply\\" in James Patrick Byrne, Philip Coleman, and Jason Francis King, eds. Ireland and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History: a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia. Vol. 3 (ABC-CLIO, 2008) pp 680-83. After the Civil War, Irish Bostonians found that the prejudice against them had lessened somewhat. The Massachusetts legislature repealed the law requiring a two-year waiting period before new citizens could vote, and passed a bill effectively declaring that Catholic students could no longer be compelled to read from the King James Bible. Soon afterwards, city officials announced that patients at Boston City Hospital could be attended by the clergy of their choice. By that time, however, the damage had been done; according to historian Thomas H. O'Connor, the bitter hostilities of the 19th century had created divisions that lasted well into the 20th.O'Connor (1995), pp. 93-94. Demographics People of Irish descent form the largest single ethnic group in Boston, making up 15.8% of the population as of 2013. As of 2014, Irish Americans made up 22.8% of the population of the metropolitan Boston area--the highest percentage of any of the 50 most populous U.S. cities--and 21.5% of the population of Massachusetts. Many cities and towns on the South Shore of Massachusetts have high percentages of Irish-descended residents. As of 2010, the most Irish city in the U.S. (regardless of population size) was Scituate, Massachusetts, with 47.5% of its residents claiming Irish ancestry.

The Sidewinders U/16 Speedway Club Inc. was founded two years earlier in 1976 by Graham Baker and Roy Bitmead, with help from Rowley Park Speedway riders Robin and Kym Amundson, and their father Bill.About Sidewinders As it was then, Sidewinders goal is to promote and develop speedway through its junior ranks with riders aged 4‚Äì15, something that had rarely been done in Australia to that point. Once a rider turns 16 he or she then move into the senior ranks. Prior to the opening of Sidewinders, most Australian Solo riders came into the sport with a background in Cycle Speedway (in Adelaide this was usually through the Findon Skid Kids cycling club) or through Scrambling, including local Adelaide hero John Boulger who during the 1980s and 1990s was a strong supporter of the speedway (despite having retired from riding in 1983 to move into first the Sprintcar, then the Speedcar ranks), lending his experience, including two Australian Championships, nine South Australian Championships, a World Team Cup win, and two World Final appearances, to up and coming riders. Track The Sidewinders Speedway, which has a dolomite surface, is the only dedicated, stand alone junior motorcycle speedway track in Australia. Other venues around the country such as the nearby Gillman Speedway, the Olympic Park and Undera Park Speedways in Victoria, and the Loxford Park Speedway in New South Wales, all boast junior tracks on the infield of their main track. The Pinjar Park motorcycle speedway just north of Perth in Western Australia is similar to Sidewinders and regularly runs junior events, though the speedway also doubles as Perth's main senior motorcycle speedway. Sidewinders offers raised viewing on the back straight which allows spectators to see over the fence with an unimpeded view of the entire track. The track also has lights allowing for night racing (installed in 1986) and a raised Control Tower with FIM standard controls for the starting gate and lights, while the pits are located on the outside of turn 4 (the pit gate is located directly to the right of the cover photo). Sidewinders also offers canteen and toilet facilities as well as merchandise sales. Entry is Adults $5.00 and Children U16 Free for race meetings, the venue has a full Canteen and both the Amenities and Canteen have disable access. Sidewinders is located on North Terrace at the end of Eighth Street Wingfield, and the season runs every fortnight from September to April. In October 2014, new bays were built in the pits for the first time giving an undercover pit area for riders and their crew to work on their machines as well as giving welcome shade. In 2017 the Club was leased the land to the west of the venue, from the previous boundary to the Gun Club, from the Port Adelaide/Enfield Council, on which to build a bigger track to be used for training for the 250cc Class. The track will have no track fence but will have sufficient run-offs instead, and there will be no racing conducted on it at all but will give the Intermediate riders a place to hone their skills before going to senior riding at Gillman. History Sidewinders, which held its first official meeting on 25 February 1978, has produced some of the biggest names in Australian speedway. Local riders to learn their skills at the speedway include 1983 European (World) Under-21 Champion Steve Baker (son of club founder Graham), Four times South Australian Champions Mark Fiora and Shane Parker, triple SA Champions Craig Hodgson and Ryan Sullivan (winner of the 2004 Australian Solo Championship), current Track Manager and twice SA Champion Scott Norman (his son Jack Norman is currently a rider at the speedway), former World Under-21 Finalist Shane Bowes, and former Moto3 rider Arthur Sissis (who in 2014 made a welcome return to the speedway ranks). Former Riders such as Parker, Norman and Bowes often host various coaching clinics at the speedway, lending their experience to young riders. Interstate riders who have also excelled at Sidewinders include triple Speedway World Champion Jason Crump, 10 times Australian Champion Leigh Adams and former Victorian and South Australian champion Jason Lyons ‚Äì all from Mildura (Sidewinders and Mildura would stage \\"test matches\\" between the clubs at their respective venues). 2012 World Champion Chris Holder from Sydney and twice World Under-21 Champion Darcy Ward from Queensland have also ridden at the speedway. Sidewinders hosted the inaugural Australian Under-16 Championship in 1982, and subsequently hosted the Championship, and the Australian Best Pairs Championship in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1997, 2002, 2006 and 2011. Local rider Paul Snadden won the first Australian U/16 title in August 1981 but this subsequently counted as the 1982 title, while other local winners include Shane Parker (1985), Ryan Sullivan (1991), Rusty Harrison (1997), and Dakota Ballentyne (2011). Victorian rider Jason Hawkes (1988, where Jason Crump finished second), Western Australian rider Trevor Harding (2002), another Mildura rider Ryan Sedgmen (2006) and NSW rider Matthew Gilmore (2016) have been the interstate winners. The club also hosts the South Australian Under-16 Solo and Sidecar championships. Sidewinders U/16 Speedway currently runs between 10 and 13 meetings per season starting in October and finishing in April. Meetings are run every second Saturday night so as not to clash with the bike only Gillman Speedway which also stages junior racing on its junior infield track. As speedway in Australia is a summer sport, Sidewinders has a hot weather policy which sometimes sees meetings cancelled if the forecast temperature is too hot (generally 35‚Äì40 ¬∞C or higher). Classes that race at Sidewinders Speedway are Junior Solos, Junior Sidecars, Novice Solo Class, Novice Sidecar Class and 50cc Mini Bikes. The club holds regular \\"Come and Try\\" events for kids interested in speedway riding. Although Solo and Sidecar racing is generally a male dominated sport, Sidewinders has seen several young girls take up speedway racing.

One story, (favored by Chapman himself) is that he was forcibly impressed into Bouchard's crew while on a stop in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii). Another story is that he was in the crew of a Bouchard corvette named Santa Rosa which mutinied, sailed to Hawaii, and tried to sell the ship to Kamehameha I, ruler of Hawaii. Bouchard, returning from the Philippines, reacquired the ship and Chapman before that deal could be completed. Recently found documents (2016) show that Chapman voluntarily joined the crew, after having been in charge of the Santa Rosa by order of Kamehameha.Rossi Belgrano Alejandro and Mariana, Nuevos Documentos sobre el Crucero de La Argentina en el Archipi√©lago Hawaiano, Vol. 2, Buenos Aires, 2017, pp. 110 Chapman was a Bouchard crewman during the 1818 attack on Monterey, California. At that point, the tales diverge again. Alta California governor Pablo Vicente de Sol√° reported that Chapman was one of three prisoners taken from one of Bouchard's two ships, the Santa Rosa, that surrendered after an artillery duel. A first-person account from the Bouchard crew says he was captured by Spanish soldiers during a sortie to the shore.Corney, P. (1965). Early voyages in the North Pacific, 1813‚Äì1818. Fairfield, Wash: Ye Galleon Press, p.54 Another variation says he was captured later, during an attack on Rancho Nuestra Se√±ora del Refugio, on the coast north of Santa Barbara.Free ebook Still another story combines the two, with Chapman first being captured at Monterey, then freed by Bouchard's raiding party, then captured a second time at Rancho Nuestra Se√±ora del Refugio. In a variation of this last, Chapman deserted Bouchard at Refugio and made his way inland to Mission Santa Inez, where he surrendered. A later story, possibly told by a son concerned with family image, ignored the pirate episode altogether and claimed that Chapman entered California after being shipwrecked near San Pedro. Free ebook Early years in California Fulling mill (c.1821) at Mission Santa Ines, CA The first historical record of Chapman's presence in California is from 1821, when he designed and helped build a fulling mill near Mission Santa In√©s.Santa In√©s Mission Mills  A Brief History During that time, he received notice from Governor Sol√° that he was included in a general amnesty granted by King Ferdinand VII of Spain to Anglo-American prisoners.Bancroft, H. H. (1885). The works of Hubert Howe Bancroft: California: vol. II, 1801-1824. San Francisco, Calif.: A.L. Bancroft, p.444 He was held nominally as a prisoner until the arrival of news in 1821 proclaiming Mexico's independence from Spain. The following year (June 24, 1822), he was baptized (converted to Roman Catholicism) at Mission San Buenaventura,Baptismal Data and married a Californio girl named Maria de Guadalupe Ortega (a daughter of Jos√© Francisco Ortega) at Mission Santa In√©s.Marriage Data His name from that point on was Jos√© Juan Chapman y Cananta. That same year, he is credited by some sources with helping to complete the roof of the Old Plaza Church in Los Angeles, by leading a logging crew into the San Gabriel Mountains to fell and bring back large pine trees for use as ceiling beams. By 1824, Chapman had prospered well enough to buy a house in the Los Angeles pueblo, along with some nearby farm land where he planted a vineyard. He continued to work on various projects for the pueblo and for Mission San Gabriel, and found favor with padre Jos√© Bernardo S√°nchez, head of the mission from 1821 to 1827.Free ebook In 1827, Chapman was one of the few available local English-speakers summoned to Mission San Gabriel to greet fellow American Jedediah Smith. Smith's party had just completed the first recorded journey to southern California by land from the United States. Smith's clerk Harrison Rogers recorded many encounters with Chapman during the party's stay at the mission, including his supervision of a neophyte (local Tongva converts) charcoal-making crew, and a conversation in which Chapman told of the natural asphalt pool near the pueblo, known to the Spanish as La Brea. Sometime between 1827 and 1831, Chapman designed and built a 60-ton schooner at San Pedro, which he christened Guadalupe in honor of his wife. In 1831, another Chapman skill was put to use. Unpopular California governor Manuel Victoria was severely wounded fighting rebellious locals at the Battle of Cahuenga Pass. Chapman was called on to dress his wounds, which he apparently did well enough that Victoria survived. That same year, Chapman was naturalized as a Mexican citizen. Move to Santa Barbara Not long after 1831, Chapman and his family moved to Santa Barbara, where he acquired the property near the beach which later became known as Burton Mound.Where was Burton Mound? Santa Barbara Independent, August 1, 2009 (accessed February, 2014) Sources disagree as to whether he bought the land from Mission Santa Barbara or received it as a grant from governor Alvarado. In 1840, he sold that property to American former fur trapper George Nidever. He then acquired other property: one source says in Santa Barbara County; another says on the Santa Clara River, on or near Rancho Santa Clara del Norte in present-day Ventura County. Death and legacy Juan Jose Chapman died and was interred in the Mission Santa Barbara cemetery on January 10, 1849.Santa Barbara Mission cemetery He and Guadalupe were the parents of eleven children, many of whose descendants still live in southern California.

It is awarded in recognition of devotion to duty, courage and endurance. The badge was created in memory of a boy sailor and Scout, Jack Cornwell, who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross after he was mortally wounded at the Battle of Jutland in 1916. History A press photograph of John Travers Cornwell VC, thought to have been posed by his younger brother, George. John Travers Cornwell, known as \\"Jack\\", was a 16-year-old Boy Seaman First Class on board the Royal Navy light cruiser, HMS Chester. At the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, Chester came under heavy fire from four German cruisers that she had encountered in poor visibility, incurring numerous casualties among the exposed crew members working the guns. Jack's captain later wrote; \\"Boy (1st Class) John Travers Cornwell of the Chester was mortally wounded early in the action. He nevertheless remained standing alone at a most exposed post, quietly awaiting orders till the end of the action, with the gun's crew dead and wounded all round him\\". Following Jack's death in Grimsby on 2 June, the Daily Sketch newspaper reported that he had been buried in a mass grave near his family home in Manor Park, Essex (now Greater London). The press coverage ensured that Jack became a popular hero; his body was exhumed and re-buried with full military honours on 29 July and he was awarded the Victoria Cross on 15 September. Because Jack Cornwell had been an enthusiastic member of his local Scout troop, Scouts had participated in his funeral procession and lined the route. Sir Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout movement, posthumously awarded Jack the Bronze Cross, Scouting's \\"highest possible award for gallantry\\".Policy, Organization and Rules for Canada, The Boy Scouts' Association, The Canadian General Council, 1919 (p. 40) In August 1916, the Scouts' Headquarters Gazette announced that a \\"Cornwell Memorial Fund\\" had been set up to provide apprenticeships or scholarships to those who qualified as \\"Cornwell Scouts\\" and suggested a donation of one penny from each member. On 14 September, the criteria for the Cornwell Scout Badge were announced. In the original scheme, eligible boys had to be First Class Scouts, have earned certain key proficiency badges and have gained an award for bravery or \\"have undergone great suffering in a heroic manner\\". A short-lived alternative to these last requirements was to \\"pass a test in physical courage, such as high diving, boxing or gymnastics\\". The first recipient of the Cornwell Scout Badge was Patrol Leader Arthur Shepherd, who had assisted the Coastguard during the wreck of the hospital ship, HMHS Rohilla, in a severe gale at Whitby in October 1914. His duties had included running messages and fetching rescue equipment along a steep narrow ledge, on a cliff that was being washed by high waves. He had also led his patrol in assisting the Coastguard during the German bombardment of Whitby in December of the same year. The badge, which was actually the manufacturer's sample and the only one in existence at the time, was presented by Baden-Powell at a rally in Middlesbrough in December 1916, in front of the Archbishop of York and 3,000 Scouts. Current usage In The Scout Association of the United Kingdom, the award of the Cornwell Scout Badge is restricted to Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts, Scouts, Explorer Scouts and Scout Network Members. Candidates must have displayed \\"pre-eminently high character and devotion to duty, together with great courage and endurance\\". In 2013, four British members were awarded the Cornwell Scout Badge (one posthumously),Roll of Honour: St George's Day Award Recipients 2013 The Scout Association, 2013 (p. 3) out of a total youth membership of 433,850. The Cornwell Memorial Fund still operates, and will make a grant to the Scout Group of the recipient of any of the Scout gallantry or meritorious awards, including recipients of the Cornwell Scout Badge, \\"in order that they can undertake an activity which involves and benefits both parties.\\" In Scouts Canada, The Jack Cornwell Decoration is awarded on very similar criteria to its British counterpart. In Scouts New Zealand, the Cornwell Scout Badge is available to youth members under the age of 19 years, the upper age limit of the Venturer Section.

Beginnings  The first fortifications were probably built between 1300 and 1330 by Dietrich von Wildenstein. He sold it in 1360 to the emperor and Bohemian king, Charles IV, who had the fort upgraded into a border castle in order to protect his Bohemian allodial estate.  Ganerbenburg  In 1478, Count Palatine Otto II set the condition for Rothenberg Castle to become a joint-fief or Ganerbenburg. 44 co-vassals who, together with the town of Rothenberg and market town of Schnaittach, acquired the castle as a so-called mesne fief or Afterlehen, were given relatively little property and few rights, but the community of co-vassals formed a strong alliance to which other members of noble families in the area could be attached.M√ºllner, pp. 31ff. The castle also had several rights of patronage in the Nuremberg area. The community of co-vassals had the characteristics of a type of union called an Einung. At the time of Silvester von Schaumberg the castle was a \\"wasp's nest\\" - which even princes feared to fall out with.Friedrich Kipp: Silvester von Schaumberg, der Freund Luthers - Ein Lebensbild aus der Reformationszeit.

Construction lasted from about 1729 to 1750. Two bastions were named after him and his wife, Maria Amalia. From time to time up to 400 soldiers were garrisoned here. It was built on an older and smaller fortification that was slighted, which in turn had been built on the remains of an even older ruined castle. The site was built to geometric principles. Because they wanted to avoid blind spots, bastions were built to a star-shaped design. The overall plan was a polygon with a bastioned tower at each corner. The crest of the embankment was kept low in order to minimise the target area. The outer defences on the north side began with a gently rising glacis, followed by a covered way and a moat. Behind that, and scarcely higher than the glacis, rose the main rampart. This was designed to be difficult to shell because the wall was protected by the glacis. The site of the fortress on a hill ridge resembled that of medieval castles, that were often built on high points that were very difficult to access. In this case, the hillside thus protected the fortress to the south, east and west from being stormed, but not from the powerful siege guns of that time. The fortress was built entirely of brickwork. This was sixteen metres high on all sides and had vaulting on the inside, ten metres high. Inside the vaulted interior of Rothenberg Fortress There were two, two-storey barrack buildings inside the fortress, an armoury, the garrison headquarters and a church. The garrison lived in the fortress with their families. Protected water supplies came from a fortress well and, later, by the Schneckenbrunnen well, built in 1759-67, in the counterguard outside the fortress. Built to counter the imperial city of Nuremberg only 25 kilometres away, the fortress was intended to guard the Bavarian border and the Electoral Bavarian enclave near Schnaittach from the city. In 1806 Napoleon annexed Franconia to the Kingdom of Bavaria and Rothenberg then became superfluous to the Bavarian Army as a border fortress. It continued to be used, however, as a fortress prison. In 1838 the Bavarian Minister of War sold the entire inventory, including doors, beams and everything that could be removed. The fortress was abandoned and fell into ruins. It was used as a quarry for the construction of Nuremberg Central Station. In 1876 explosive demolition testing was carried out on the ravelin. The site may be visited as part of a guided tour. The underground casemates are out of bounds from November to April in order protect bats. Southward of the ruins you can find a cemetery. 1083 people were buried on this place.

Completed in 1948, it is the first in a series of six heads, the remainder of which were painted the following year in preparation for a November 1949 exhibition at the Hanover Gallery in London.Russell, 38 Like the others in the series, it shows a screaming figure alone in a room, and focuses on the open mouth.Dawson, 44 The work shows a skull which has disintegrated on itself and is largely a formless blob of flesh.Zweite, 83 The entire upper half has disappeared, leaving only the jaw, mouth and teeth and one ear still intact. It is the first of Bacon's paintings to feature gold background railings or bars; later to become a prominent feature of his 1950s work, especially in the papal portraits where they would often appear as enclosing or cages around the figures.Davies; Yard, 19 It is not known what influences were behind the image; most likely they were multiple ‚Äì press or war photography, and critic Denis Farr detects the influence of Matthias Gr√ºnewald.Farr et al, 58 Bacon juxtaposes traditional elements of portraiture with loose, spontaneous brushwork. In some passages he has rubbed or brushed out (perhaps with a cloth) the paint, a technique art historian Armin Zweite describes as \\"productive vandalism\\".Zweit, 84 There are a number of ambiguous elements in the work. The hanging tassel rest just above the figure's right ear, giving the impression that it has hooked the head and is pulling it sideways. The gold railings suggest in the top right suggest the corner of a room, while those in the center background may be the headboard of a bed. The upper half is largely void of detail, while the lower portion, particularly the lower third has been heavily reworked, and consists of a blending of white, gray and black pigments. The use of heavy impasto\\"Head I\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 7 February 2014. gives the impression of animal skin; critic Robert Melville described the \\"color of wet, black snakes lightly powdered with dust\\". In 1951 Bacon said of his choice of colour and gloss; \\"One of the problems is to paint like Vel√°zquez, but with the texture of a hippopotamus skin\\", and later \\"I had an idea in those days that textures should be very much thicker, and therefore the texture of, for instance a rhinoceros skin would help me to think about the texture of the human skin\\".Russell, 71 Furthering this impression, the mouth and teeth resemble those of a howling fanged animal. Bacon began the Head series out of necessity; he was granted the 1949 exhibition at the Hayward a year in advance, but had not painted at all in 1947, and had only a few works he was happy with from 1948. Over time, the series became something quite apart from his initial idea; Head VI turned into the first of his many examinations of Vel√°zquez's c. 1650 Portrait of Innocent X.Zweite, 74Heads III-V are usually considered less successful and minor works References= Notes Sources *Davies, Hugh; Yard, Sally.

Opened on April 5, 2019, the Shed commissions, produces, and presents a wide range of activities in performing arts, visual arts, and pop culture. The Shed is located in the Bloomberg Building, adjacent to the northern leg of the High Line elevated park, near the Chelsea gallery district. It is attached to 15 Hudson Yards, a skyscraper within the Hudson Yards real estate development, although the Shed itself is located on city-owned land. The cultural center is maintained by an independent nonprofit cultural organization of the same name. The CEO/Artistic Director for the Shed is Alex Poots. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is Daniel Doctoroff. Construction on the Shed started in 2015, using a design from lead architect Diller Scofidio + Renfro and collaborating architect Rockwell Group. Structural engineering, the facade, and kinetic design was provided by Thornton Tomasetti. Hardesty & Hanover was the mechanization consultant. The Shed features several architectural features, including a retractable shell that creates a space, named The McCourt, for large-scale performances, installations and events; a 500-seat theater; and two levels of exhibition space. The plans for the cultural center have drawn praise from numerous media outlets and art institutions. It was initially criticized by the surrounding community, but as construction progressed, media reviews of the Shed have leaned more positive. History=Rezoning In January 2005, the New York City Council approved the rezoning of about 60 blocks from 28th to 43rd Streets; in 2009, after the stadium failed to win state approval, the West Side Yard was similarly rezoned. As rezoned, the Hudson Yards area will have of Class A office space, 20,000 housing units, of hotel space, 750-seat public school, of retail and more than of public open space, which includes building a subway extension of the 7 train to help encourage development of the Hudson Yards area. In May 2010, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) leased the air rights over the rail yard for 99 years, at a price of to a joint venture of Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group, which built a platform above both the eastern and western portions of the yard on which to construct the buildings, including what was then known as the Culture Shed. In April 2013, the Related/Oxford joint venture obtained a $475 million construction loan from parties including Barry Sternlicht's Starwood Property Group and luxury retailer Coach. The financing deal was unique in several aspects, including the fact that it included a construction mezzanine loan, that Coach was a lender on both the debt and equity sides, and that the MTA helped create the \\"severable lease\\" structure that allowed for the loans. Funding and land ownership The platform supporting the Shed under construction in September 2014 As part of the Hudson Yards rezoning plan, the city preserved a parcel of city-owned land on West 30th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues, adjacent to The High Line, for future cultural use. Dan Doctoroff, then the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and Rebuilding, spearheaded the effort to determine what should go there. Working closely with then Department of Cultural Affairs Commissioner Kate Levin, they determined the space \\"should be a highly flexible one that could cater to the growing desire of many artists to break out of their silos and blend disciplines.\\" The City issued a Request for Proposals for this new cultural facility in 2008 at the height of the recession. The City selected Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Lead Architect and Rockwell Group, Collaborating Architect to develop their concept for a flexible building, an ‚Äúarchitecture of infrastructure‚Äù that could house all the creative disciplines under one roof. The Shed, a relatively small six-story building compared to the Hudson Yards skyscrapers, was built at the south side of the Hudson Yards development site. The city retains ownership of the land on which the Shed is built and provided Capital Grant funding for the project. Funding for the Shed was secured from the City in July 2013. Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg quietly donated $15 million to the Shed in 2012, then added another $60 million of donations five years later. The city had also given $50 million toward the project in 2013, representing the single largest capital grant given by the city that year; this funding was later raised to $75 million. , the Shed had received $529 million in donations for its $550 million capital campaign to fund building construction, programming and start-up expenses. Construction The Shed, a nonprofit organization, was formed in 2012 to oversee construction of the building, and to run the building when it opens. In 2013, Dan Doctoroff became Chairman. In that capacity, he led the $550 million capital campaign and the board of directors, oversaw the building‚Äôs design and construction, and managed the search for the artistic director. The design of the Shed's building is a collaboration between two New York City architectural firms: Lead architect Diller Scofidio + Renfro and collaborating architect Rockwell Group. The main contractor was Sciame, while the steel fabricator was Cimolai.CONSULTANTS & CONTRACTORS Construction of the Shed over the West Side Yard, began after caissons were sunk to support a platform over the tracks. The platform supporting the towers, comprising 16 bridges, was completed in late 2014. The construction of the building itself began in mid-2015. The name of the space was changed to simply \\"The Shed\\" in 2016. The retractable shell was completed by 2017. Although early reports stated that the building would open in 2017 or 2018, a 2015 report placed the opening date at 2019. , the pace of construction indicated that the Shed was projected to open in either 2018 or 2019. By early January 2019, it was announced that the Shed would open on April 5, 2019, with four live productions and exhibitions. The Shed's building at Hudson Yards was ceremonially renamed as the Bloomberg Building after former mayor Bloomberg, who donated $75 million of the structure's predicted $475 million cost. In addition, the Shed signed a contract with Altice USA, who would become the Shed's \\"exclusive connectivity provider\\". A dedication ceremony for the Shed was held on April 1, 2019. The Shed opened as scheduled four days later. Design Wheels used to retract or to extend the shell The Shed is a visual arts and performing arts center located at the Hudson Yards development's southern edge. The structure includes of column-free exhibition space, of \\"museum-quality\\" space, a theater with seating for up to 500 people, and an expandable, shell that uses industrial crane technology, allowing the space to expand and contract to accommodate many events and audiences. Viewers of indoor shows and exhibitions will be charged admission. The Shed's main entrance is on 30th Street under the High Line; secondary entrances are located in the Hudson Yards public plaza. The Shed's Hudson Yards plaza entrance is located close to the 34th Street‚ÄìHudson Yards subway entrance. There are two galleries indoors on the first and second levels. On the third level is a flexible space that can be used for performances or exhibits. The wraparound shell weighs , is made of an exposed steel diagram frame, clad in a fluorine-based plastic called ETFE, which has the thermal properties of insulating glass at a fraction of the weight. The shell can close and open within 5 minutes and when the shell is retracted, the open-air plaza becomes a publicly accessible outdoor space. The shell retracts on eight bogie wheels, each in diameter, powered by a total of six 15-horsepower motors. The Shed is directly adjacent to 15 Hudson Yards and the High Line. Events, commissions, and management The Shed is planned to host many cultural events including for art, performance, film, design, food, fashion, and new combinations of cultural content. At least one event, New York Fashion Week, is considering moving to the Shed for all of its exhibitions. In 2014, Alex Poots was named the CEO/Artistic Director of the Shed. He was formerly the director of the Manchester International Festival and Park Avenue Armory prior to assuming his position at the Shed. Notable events Vessel (under construction) behind it In fall 2016, the Shed started a citywide dance program about social justice issues. It also partnered with the MIT Media Lab to assist artists who were creating works involving virtual reality and artificial intelligence. The first permanent art commission for the Shed was announced in May 2017. Artist Lawrence Weiner was commissioned to decorate the plaza with pavers arranged into letters, which would spell the phrase \\"In front of itself\\". The exhibitions and performances announced before the building's April 5, 2019, opening included a concert series exploring the impact of African American music conceived and directed by Steve McQueen and a creative team including Quincy Jones; a collaboration between artist Gerhard Richter and music composers Steve Reich and Arvo P√§rt, the eponymous \\"Reich Richter P√§rt'; \\"Norma Jeane Baker of Troy\\", a performance piece by the poet Anne Carson with music by Paul Clark, starring Ben Whishaw and Renee Fleming; and an exhibition of work from artist Trisha Donnelly. This would be followed by several other shows in quick succession. In summer 2018, the Shed hosted an exhibition by Tony Cokes about gentrification. From May 6, 2019 to June 1, 2019, Icelandic music artist Bj√∂rk performed a concert series known as \\"Bj√∂rk's Cornucopia,\\" which took place entirely on a set and included unique and bizarre imagery, a high emphasis on costume and set design, a choir segment, and activism for environmentalism. In addition, the Michael Bay film 6 Underground premiered at the Shed on December 10, 2019. Critical reception The Shed's construction was initially opposed by local community leadership. Board members on Manhattan Community Board 4 stated that the Shed \\"could lack class\\", that the word \\"culture\\" is too vague for the name of such an exhibition space, and that problems could arise when a space is closed off twice a year for two weeks (adding up to a month annually) for New York Fashion Week. Community board members also state that when the retractable roof is closed, of open public space would be lost. Additionally, some expressed concerns that the large value of the Capital Grant allocation‚ÄîUS$50 million‚Äîwas too much money to award to a building that did not yet exist. In recent years, local support has grown and several local officials now sit on The Shed's board of directors. The Shed has drawn mixed public reviews, as well as high praise from numerous art institutions. In an editorial for the art website Artsy, one writer stated that although \\"the building's innovative architecture seems ready to withstand the weight of [the Shed's] grand ambitions\\", the construction of the Shed also had the unforeseen side effect of \\"making New York ever less accessible for those without financial means\\", considering the poor neighborhoods located close to Hudson Yards. The New York Times has hailed The Shed as \\"a project that could reshape and redefine the city‚Äôs physical and cultural infrastructure\\" and \\"one of the most significant additions to New York City‚Äôs cultural landscape in decades.\\" In August 2019, news of Shed board member Stephen Ross's plans to host a fundraiser for U.S. president Donald Trump's 2020 reelection campaign caused several artists to protest. Fashion label Rag & Bone decided against hosting their fall 2019 New York Fashion Week show at The Shed. AL Steiner and Zachary Drucker both removed their work from an exhibition at the Shed.

Bianchi is an American medical geneticist and neonatologist noted for her research on fetal cell microchimerism and prenatal testing. She is the director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, part of the National Institutes of Health. Bianchi had previously been the Natalie V. Zucker Professor of Pediatrics, Obstetrics, and Gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine and executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center. She also has served as Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Pediatrics at the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center. Early life and education Bianchi grew up in New York City. She graduated from Hunter College High School. Bianchi earned a B.A. magna cum laude from University of Pennsylvania and an M.D. from Stanford University School of Medicine. While at Stanford she performed her doctoral research with Leonard Herzenberg, Ph.D., studying the use of flow cytometry to develop a noninvasive cytogenetic prenatal diagnostic test for Down syndrome. One of Herzenberg‚Äôs children had Down syndrome, so the project had both scientific and personal significance for her mentor. Career After medical school at Stanford University, she completed her postdoctoral work at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Bianchi joined the faculty at Harvard University in 1986, concurrently assuming a position as an attending neonatologist and geneticist at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital. In 1993, Bianchi left to take a position at Tufts University School of Medicine, receiving an endowed chair in 2002. In 2007, Bianchi became editor-in-chief of Prenatal Diagnosis, the journal of the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis. In 2010, she founded the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center, assuming the position of executive director. Bianchi is one of four authors of the book Fetology: Diagnosis and Management of the Fetal Patient, which won the Association of American Publishers award for the best textbook in clinical medicine in 2000. Bianchi has worked for many years on developing methods to isolate intact fetal cells from maternal blood as a noninvasive way to obtain fetal material for genetic diagnosis. While the work proved challenging due to the relative rarity of the fetal cells in the mother‚Äôs blood, the research led to an unexpected finding. Bianchi discovered that intact fetal cells remain in the mother's blood and organs for decades following pregnancy, with the possibility of migrating to the site of an injury in the mother, dividing and changing into the cells needed to fix the problem. This has led to a field of study known as fetal cell microchimerism. Bianchi also has worked extensively on noninvasive prenatal testing using DNA sequencing of fetal and placental DNA fragments in the blood of pregnant women. Dr. Bianchi‚Äôs research is part of what has helped expand the use of non-invasive testing in the general obstetrical population. The sequencing technology employed in cfDNA testing has a number of potential uses in many areas of health care, Dr. Messerlian says, including cancer, transplantation and in vitro fertilization protocols, and research she is conducting is exploring those possibilities. This technology has been used in clinical prenatal care since 2011. In addition, Bianchi has pioneered the study of the amniotic fluid fetal transcriptome to develop new approaches to prenatal treatment of genetic conditions. She is a former member of the Clinical Advisory Board of Verinata Health, an Illumina company.Clinical Advisory Board Verinata In 2014, Bianchi was the lead author on a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that examined cell-free fetal DNA test performance in a general obstetrical population. This study showed that cell-free DNA testing had lower false positive rates and higher positive predictive values than maternal serum biochemistry analyses with or without ultrasound measurements of the back of the fetal neck. Bianchi has also studied the underlying biological reasons for false positive results following NIPT. She has shown that maternal malignancies can cause genome-wide imbalance that presents as a false positive result of fetal aneuploidy. Currently, Bianchi is working with a mouse model to develop a prenatal treatment that could be given to a pregnant woman carrying a fetus with Down syndrome. The goal of the work is to improve brain development in the womb and neurocognition after birth. Bianchi was appointed director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development on August 25, 2016. In this role, she oversees research on pediatric health and development, maternal health, medical rehabilitation, population dynamics, reproductive health, and intellectual and developmental disabilities.

As a member of the Finnish national team, she won a bronze medal at the 2018 Winter Olympic Games and bronze medals at the IIHF World Women's Championships in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2015, and 2017. She attended the University of Minnesota and played collegiate hockey with the Minnesota Golden Gophers from 2009 until her graduation in 2013. She was one of the first European players to join the team and recorded 19 goals and 37 assists (56 points) during her collegiate career. In her post- collegiate and professional playing career, she played with SKIF Nizhny Novgorod of the Women's Hockey League (ZhHL), Lule√• Hockey/MSSK of the Swedish Women's Hockey League (SDHL), Oulun K√§rp√§t of the Naisten Liiga, and the Minnesota Whitecaps of the National Women's Hockey League (NWHL). Early career Jalosuo was born in 1989 to Aki-Pekka and Sirpa Jalosuo, and raised in Lieksa, a small town in eastern Finland. When she was in fifth grade she began playing organized hockey with the local club, Lieksan Hurtat, where, at the encouragement of her coaches and teammates, she played on both the girl's and boy's teams. Motivated to further improve her game, she moved to Oulu at age 15 and joined K√§rp√§t of the Naisten SM-sarja. While playing in the premiere women's league in Finland she also attended Kastelli School, one of Finland's best public centers for primary and secondary education. With K√§rp√§t she won Finnish Championship silver medals in 2006 and 2007 and bronze medals in 2005 and 2008 and was named to the SM-sarja All-Star Team in 2007 and 2008. Jalosuo served as team captain for the 2008‚Äì09 season, an impressive accomplishment when one considers that she was only 18 years old and still in high school. During her time living in Oulu, Jalosuo also played with the Finnish national team, playing in four world championships, including every championship game in 2008 and 2009. When asked to reflect on this period, Jalosuo has said, ‚ÄúI would say that I was a very good locker room player who treated everyone evenly. On the ice I had a pretty good shot, and I was able to read the game well.‚Äù Jalosuo was recruited by multiple American universities with NCAA Division I women's ice hockey teams as her graduation from Kastelli School (2009) approached. She toured The Ohio State University, the University of Minnesota Duluth, and the University of Minnesota in 2008. She ultimately selected to attend the University of Minnesota and don the Minnesota Golden Gophers‚Äô sweater as an incoming freshman for the 2009-10 scholastic year. College career Jalosuo and her college roommate, goaltender Noora R√§ty, became the first European players to join the Minnesota Golden Gophers. During her four years on the team, Jalosuo scored a total of 57 points, with 19 goals and 37 assists over 152 games. She played in 37 games during her 2009‚Äì10 freshman season, recording one goal and five assists, with a +4 rating. She scored her first collegiate point when she assisted on Chelsey Jones' goal against Syracuse Orange on 4 October 2009. She missed three games in January to play with the Finnish National Team at the Meco Cup in Germany. Jalouso scored her first collegiate goal in an 8‚Äì5 win over the MSU-Mankato Mavericks during the first round of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association playoffs on 26 February. She was the last player cut for the 2010 Winter Olympics, which she called \\"a turning point in my life and hockey career\\" that made her more determined to make a future Olympic team. During her 2010‚Äì11 sophomore season, Jalosuo was a WCHA All-Academic Team honoree and letterwinner. She played all 38 games of the season and recorded four goals (all on the power play and eight assists, with a +9 rating. Paired with Anne Schleper, Jalosuo had two multi-point games, scored her first assist of the season against the St. Cloud State Huskies on 22 October, and scored game- winning goals in both games against the Harvard Crimson on 26 and 28 November. She also set up Terry Kelly's goal in the 4‚Äì2 victory over the Minnesota‚ÄìDuluth Bulldogs in a WCHA semi-final game on 4 March. During her 2011‚Äì12 junior season, Jalosuo was an Academic All-WCHA and scored a total of three goals and six assists, netting her first goal of the season in a 4‚Äì0 win over Syracuse on 1 October. She scored one assist each during the WCHA first round and semi-finals, and had a +3 rating during a 5‚Äì1 National Collegiate Athletic Association Quarterfinal win over the University of North Dakota on 10 March. In her 2011‚Äì12 senior season, Jalosuo recorded a career-high 30 points, with 11 goals and 19 assists over all 41 games of the season, for a +38 rating. Four of her goals were game-winners, and she was named to the All- WCHA Third Team and the All-WCHA Academic Team. She scored a goal in each of game of the opening series against the Colgate Raiders on 28 and 29 September, and had two-point streaks during the season, recording six assists and one goal between 12 and 20 October, and five assists and one goal between 2 and 16 February. She scored a goal in the 5‚Äì0 shutout over the Bemidji State Beavers in the WCHA First Round on 1 March, as well as a goal in a win, also 5‚Äì0, against the Ohio State Buckeyes on 8 March in the semi-finals of the WCHA Final Face-Off. Jalosuo assisted Terry Kelly on the game-winning goal in their triple-overtime victory over North Dakota on 16 March in the NCAA QUarterfinals, and recorded the first goal of the National Championship game against the Boston University Terriers on 24 March. Post-college playing career Jalouso played with SKIF Nizhny Novgorod of the Russian Women's Hockey League for the 2013‚Äì14 and 2014‚Äì15 seasons. She won the Russian Championship with the team in 2014. Her teammates from the Finnish national team, Karoliina Rantam√§ki and goaltenders Noora R√§ty and Meeri R√§is√§nen, also played with SKIF for one or both of the seasons that Jalouso was with the team. In the 2015‚Äì16 season Jalouso played with Lule√• HF in the Swedish Women's Hockey League (SDHL). She played only three regular season games with the team but managed to record two goals and five assists for seven points in that short span. With Lule√• she played in seven playoff games and she contributed five points (3+2) to the team's Swedish Championship victory in 2016. Michelle Karvinen and Nora Tallus, teammates from the Finnish national team, also played with Lule√• in that season. Jalouso returned to the Twin Cities, her college stomping grounds, to play with the Minnesota Whitecaps for the 2016‚Äì17 and 2017‚Äì18 seasons. The Whitecaps were independent in those seasons and played the majority of their games against women's college squads. The Whitecaps‚Äô non-standard schedule allowed Jalouso to play some regular season games with Oulun K√§rp√§t, the team she had played with in Finland prior to her collegiate career, in the 2016‚Äì17 and 2017‚Äì18 seasons. She also played with K√§rp√§t in the 2017 Finnish Championship and contributed ten points (5+5) in eight games, leading to the team's Aurora Borealis Cup victory. Her efforts earned her the Karoliina Rantam√§ki Award for the most valuable player of the Naisten SM-Liiga playoffs.

Constituted by the Capitano del popolo, an administrative title used in Italy during the Middle Ages. The Marquisate of Mantua began with Gianfrancesco I Gonzaga, a member of the important House of Gonzaga, who inherited the city of Mantua in 1407, when he was only 12 years old. History The 9th century was the period of episcopal supremacy, and in the 11th the city formed part of the vast possessions of Bonifacio III, marquis of Canossa. From him it passed to Geoffrey, duke of Lorraine, and afterwards to the countess Matilda, whose support of the pope led to the conquest of Mantua by the emperor Henry IV in 1090. Reduced to obedience by Matilda in 1113, the city obtained its liberty on her death, and instituted a communal government of its own, salva imperiali justitia. It afterwards joined the Lombard League; and the unsuccessful attack made by Frederick II in 1236 brought it a confirmation of its privileges. But after a period of internal discord Ludovico Gonzaga attained to power (1328), and was recognized as imperial vicar (1329); and from that time till the death of Ferdinando Carlo in 1708 the Gonzagas were masters of Mantua under Gian Francesco II, the first Margrave, Ludovico III, Gian Francesco II (whose wife was Isabella d'Este), and Federico II, the first duke of Mantua, the city rose rapidly into importance as a seat of industry and culture.

Having first emerged as women's shelters in the mid 1980s, feminist women's organisations in Malaysia later developed alliances with other social justice movements. Today, the feminist movement in Malaysia is one of the most active actors in the country's civil society. History Fiesta Feminista in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah The history of feminist movement in Malaysia, its birth and the usage of the very term 'feminist' are contested. Unlike the history of the feminist movement in Britain and the United States for instance, the struggle for women's rights in Malaysia were not founded on women's right to vote. Like many other postcolonial countries during the fall of the British empire, all Malaysian citizens, both male and female, were granted the right to vote during the country's political independence in 1957. Women's emancipation in colonial Malaya To avoid the anachronism of the term feminist, it may be advisable to chart the history of feminism in Malaysia with the recorded usage and political championing of 'women's liberation' in the early twentieth century. The first documented use of women's liberation or women's emancipation as a political and social project in 1920s Malaya was by Malay Muslim male reformers and writers Syed Syeikh Al-Hadi and Zainal Abidin Ahmad, better known as Za'aba. Although they advocated the education of women and girls as a means to women's emancipation, the Malay Muslim modernists, or kaum muda, stressed the importance of Islamic learning as a way of equipping Malay women with the skills to fulfill their primary role, as educators of their children. In the post-war years between 1946 and 1948, women from different ethnic groups mobilised against anti- colonialism and issues related to women's inferior status in occupied Malaya. Although they were members of the female-arm of nationalist and communist parties founded by men, the women became more radicalised in their gender- oriented anti-colonial aims and eventually gained semi-autonomous status from their parent parties. Prominent radical women of the period included the likes of Shamsiah Fakeh and later, Khatijah Sidek. Issues in Malaysian feminist struggle=Sexual and domestic violence against women The first women's NGO in Malaysia, the Women's Aid Organisation (WAO) , was founded in the mid 1980s as a shelter for women and children who needed legal consultation and protection from domestic violence. Soon, other NGOs, such as [All Women Action Society of Malaysia] (AWAM) emerged to campaign against the rising number of reported incidences of violence against women. Most women's NGOs which were founded since are located in the urban centres of Peninsular Malaysia. Malaysia outlawed marital rape in 2007.MP Teresa Kok, Mixed reaction to marital rape reform, Sassy MP, September 15, 2007.AP, \\"Malaysian jailed for marital rape,\\" Sydney Morning Herald, August 6, 2009. Child brides and forced marriages Cases of child marriages gained nationwide attention in recent years as a human rights and gender issue. In nearly all cases, under- aged girls were married off to men much older than themselves. As most child marriages occur in Malaysia's Malay-Muslim community and thereby sanctioned by Sharia courts, Islamic reasons are often cited as a moral and legal justification for marrying off under-aged girls.\\"Calls to end child marriages in Malaysia after 12 year old weds,\\" The New York Times, 26 November 2012.

The only currently existing component is the 1st Battalion, 103rd Field Artillery Regiment (1-103rd FAR), a unit of the Rhode Island National Guard. The regiment was originally constituted in 1917, but it descends from predecessor units dating back to 1801. Predecessor Units (1801 to 1917)=Providence Marine Corps of Artillery The 103d Field Artillery Regiment traces its origins to the Providence Marine Corps of Artillery (PMCA). (Despite the similarity of their names, the PMCA has no connection with the United States Marine Corps.) The PMCA was originally organized in 1801 by the Providence Marine Society (founded in 1798). The PMCA's original purpose was to provide trained gun crews to merchant ships based in Providence, Rhode Island, which had been threatened by the French during the Quasi War (1798‚Äì1800) as well as the increasing menace of the Barbary Pirates in the Mediterranean Sea. The PMCA's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Commandant Seth Wheaton (1759‚Äì1827), who had served as a lieutenant in the Rhode Island Militia during the American Revolution. With the pacification of the Barbary states, the PMCA continued as a chartered command of the Rhode Island Militia. As a chartered command, it had the privilege of electing its own officers and was subject only to the authority of the Governor of Rhode Island ‚Äì as it was not part of the \\"regular\\" militia structure of the state ‚Äì rather than the senior officers of the state militia. Its membership consisted of leading citizens of Providence and was, thereby, considered an \\"elite\\" military unit. About 1850, the PMCA acquired the use of a castle-style armory, which is known as the Benefit Street Arsenal, from the Providence Light Infantry. The Arsenal, completed in 1839, still serves as the headquarters of the PMCA and holds a large collection of military artifacts ranging from the Civil War to the Second World War. The Arsenal is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. American Civil War During the American Civil War, the PMCA was activated twice. The first time was at the outbreak of the war when it served from April 18 to August 1, 1861, as the 1st Rhode Island Battery under the command of Captain Charles H. Tompkins. The unit was armed with 14-pounder James rifles at the First Battle of Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia, where weapons of this type are emplaced as of 2015 in the Manassas National Battlefield Park to commemorate the battery's service. The second time was from May to August 1862, when it served as the 10th Rhode Island Battery under the command of Captain Edwin C. Gallup. The 10th Battery was deployed, along with the 9th and 10th Rhode Island Infantry regiments, to defend Washington, D.C. The battery moved to Washington, D.C., May 27‚Äì29, 1862, and was attached to Whipple's Command, Military District of Washington. Served duty at Camp Frieze, Tennallytown, until June 23. At Cloud's Mills until June 30, and then near Fort Pennsylvania until August when the battery returned to Rhode Island and was mustered out of service August 30, 1862. The Benefit Street Arsenal not only served as the mobilization site for the PMCA but, also, for all eight batteries of the 1st Rhode Island Light Artillery Regiment, which was organized in 1861. As a result, the PMCA is considered the \\"Mother of the Rhode Island Batteries\\" ‚Äì as is stated on a plaque affixed to the Benefit Street Arsenal. As a result of desiring a veteran's organization under their own authority, veteran members of the PMCA formed the \\"Veteran Association PMCA\\". This association, composed of past and honorary members of the Providence Marine Corps of Artillery, was organized on January 21, 1874. Its object was to \\"afford occasional opportunities to revive pleasant memories of the past, to unite in sympathy graduates separated by many years, and to secure for the active corps the benefit of their interest, influence, and strength\\". A large number of leading citizens of Rhode Island were members of the Veteran Association ‚Äì including governors William Sprague, Henry Lippitt and Elisha Dyer, Jr..http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rigenweb/Providence/article274.html The Veteran Association continues to exist as a private organization and is the de facto veterans association for the 103d Field Artillery Regiment. Light Battery A On April 19, 1875, the PMCA voted to make itself subject to the state militia laws and, on May 1, 1875, the PMCA was re-designated as Light Battery A of the 1st Artillery Battalion of the Rhode Island Militia.The Providence Plantations for 250 Years. William Arnold Greene. J.A.&R.A.; Reid Publishers. Providence. 1886. pg. 181. The other unit of the battalion was designated as Light Battery B. Battery B and the battalion were disbanded in 1879 when Light Battery A continued as a separate unit within the Rhode Island Militia. Battery A was mobilized on June 25, 1898, for service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War under the command of Captain Edgar R. Barker. The battery did not serve overseas but was stationed at the Quonset Point militia training camp in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. It was mustered out of service on October 26, 1898. Battery A became part of the Rhode Island National Guard when the Guard was organized from units of the Rhode Island Militia in 1907. The National Guard was created by the Militia Act of 1903 which provided federal funding for state militia units in exchange for the units being trained and equipped to federal standards. While some militia units declined to be governed by federal regulations, Battery A, along with most of the other Rhode Island Militia units, chose to become part of the National Guard.Rhody Redlegs. Robert Grandchamp. McFarland Publishers. First World War (1917 to 1919) Light Battery A was expanded on June 15, 1917, to form the 1st Separate Battalion, Rhode Island Field Artillery. It was mustered into active service on 25 July 25, 1917, at Quonset Point and drafted into federal service August 5, 1917. The unit was reorganized and redesignated on 20 August 1917 as the 1st Battalion of the newly formed 103d Field Artillery Regiment, an element of the 26th Division. The 26th Division, nicknamed the \\"Yankee Division\\", was formed from National Guard units of all six New England states. The 103d Field Artillery Regiment consisted of two battalions of three batteries each. It served with the 101st and 102d Field Artillery Regiments in the 51st Field Artillery Brigade of the 26th Division. Along with the rest of the 26th Division, the 103d was shipped to France in late 1917. Overseas, the regiment participated in six campaigns prior to the Armistice on November 11, 1918. The six campaigns were: Champagne-Marne, Aisne-Marne, St. Mihiel, Meuse- Argonne, Ile de France and Lorraine. Interwar period (1919 to 1941) The 103d was demobilized, along with the 26th Division, on April 29, 1919, at Camp Devens, Massachusetts. It was reorganized between April and November 1921 in the Rhode Island National Guard at Providence, Rhode Island, as the 1st Battalion, Field Artillery, with the headquarters being federally recognized on 17 November 1921 at Providence. The 1st Battalion was redesignated on November 25. 1921 as the 1st Battalion, 103d Field Artillery (1st/103d FA), an element of the 43rd Infantry Division, a newly formed National Guard division with units from Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maine, and Vermont. The regiment was consolidated on January 2, 1930, with the 2d Squadron, 122nd Cavalry Regiment which became the 2nd Battalion, 103d Field Artillery (2nd/103d FA) and the consolidated unit was reorganized and redesignated as the 103d Field Artillery, with headquarters at Providence. During the interwar period the 103d was activated by order of the Governor of Rhode Island for the following state emergencies: * Strike Duty, Pawtuxet, Feb 20 to 1Oct 14, 1922 * Strike duty, Manville, Aug 31 to Sep 3, 1926 * Textile workers strike, Saylesville and Bristol, September 10-14, 1934 * Flood relief, Pawtuxet River, March 19-20, 1936 * Flood relief, Norwood, July 24-26, 1938 * 1938 Hurricane, Sep 21-25, 1938 World War II (1941‚Äì1945) The 103d was inducted into federal service, as a unit of the 43rd Infantry Division, on 24 February 1941 at home stations and was ordered to Camp Blanding, Florida. The 103d Field Artillery Regiment was broken up on 19 February 1942 and its elements reorganized and redesignated as follows: 1st and 2d Battalions as the 103d and 169th Field Artillery Battalions, respectively, elements of the 43d Infantry Division; the Regimental Headquarters was disbanded at this time. During the Second World War, the 103d and 169th Field Artillery Battalions served with the 43rd Infantry Division in the Pacific Theater. Both units earned campaign credit for service in the New Guinea, Northern Solomons, and Luzon campaigns. Additionally, the 169th Field Artillery Battalion earned credit for the Guadalcanal campaign. Captain Elwood Joseph Euart of the regiment was the only member of the 103rd lost in the sinking of the U.S. Army transport USAT President Coolidge on October 26, 1942. Captain Euart had safely got off President Coolidge when he heard that there were still men in the infirmary who could not get out. He returned through one of the sea doors, successfully rescued the men but was then unable to escape himself and went down with the ship. He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his heroic actions.DPaa release 2016 The 43d Division was located in the Philippines at the time of the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945. Post‚ÄìWorld War II (1945 to 2001) The 103d Field Artillery Battalion was inactivated on October 22, 1945, at Camp Stoneman, California. It was reorganized and federally recognized in the Rhode Island National Guard on 15 October 1946 with headquarters at Providence. The 169th Field Artillery Battalion was inactivated on 22 October 1945 at Camp Stoneman, California. On 21 May 21, 1946, it was relieved from assignment to the 43d Infantry Division. Reorganized and federally recognized 19 January 1948 with headquarters at Providence. Reorganized and redesignated 1 March 1949 as the 169th Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion and assigned to the 43d Infantry Division. Shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, in June 1950, the 103d and 169th battalions, as units of the 43d Infantry Division, were ordered into active federal service September 5, 1950, and spent three years in Germany replacing Regular Army units which had been sent to fight in Korea. The 43d Infantry Division was demobilized shortly after the armistice was signed in July 1953. The 103d Field Artillery Battalion and the 169th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion were consolidated April 1, 1959, with Headquarters, 103d Field Artillery (concurrently reconstituted in the Rhode Island Army National Guard) to form the 103d Artillery, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System, to consist of the 1st Rocket Howitzer Battalion and the 2d, 3d, and 4th Howitzer Battalions, elements of the 43d Infantry Division. The 103d FA Battalion was re-designated as 1st Battalion, 103d Artillery Regiment (1st/103d) on June 19, 1961. The 103d Artillery Regiment was reorganized 18 March 1963 to consist of the 1st, 2d, and 3d Howitzer Battalions. Reorganized on January 1, 1965, to consist of the 1st, 2d, and 3d Howitzer Battalions and Battery F. Reorganized March 1, 1966, to consist of the 1st, 2d, and 3d Howitzer Battalions. The 43d Infantry Division was disbanded on December 16, 1967, and its units were assigned to other organizations. The 103d Artillery was reorganized on February 1, 1968, to consist of the 1st and 2d Battalions. The 103d Artillery Regiment was redesignated on 1 March 1972 as the 103d Field Artillery Regiment. In February 1978 the 103d Field Artillery was mobilized, along with the entire Rhode Island National Guard, to provide emergency service in response to the Great Blizzard of 1978, which paralyzed the state with over 3 feet of snow. In 1979 the Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the 103d Field Artillery Brigade was constituted to provide commanded and control of the 1st/103d and the 2nd/103d. The 103d FA Brigade also had operational control of three other field artillery battalions under the CAPSTONE program which integrated Regular Army, Army Reserve, and National Guard units. While the 103d FA Brigade shared the same numerical designation as the 103d FA Regiment, it did not share the same lineage and honors as it was a newly created unit. As of 1984 the 1st and 2nd Battalions were part of the 103rd Field Artillery Brigade, headquartered at Providence, both equipped with 155-mm towed artillery pieces.Isby and Kamps 1985, 385. The 2d Battalion, 103d Field Artillery Regiment was inactivated in April 1990. The 1-103d remained under the 103d Field Artillery Brigade. In the late 1990s the Cranston Street Armory in Providence was closed and the headquarters of the 103d Field Artillery Brigade, as well as the Headquarters Battery, Battery A, and Service Battery of the 1st-103d, were relocated to the Armory of Mounted Commands on North Main Street in Providence. Battery B of the 1-103d was located at a former Nike missile site in North Smithfield and Battery C was located in Bristol adjacent to the Rhode Island Veterans Home. Recent conflicts (2001 to present) Elements of the 1st Battalion, 103d Field Artillery Regiment were mobilized for service in Iraq and Kuwait during Operation Iraqi Freedom. From January 2004 to April 2005 batteries A and B of the 1-103d served on active duty and supported combat operation in Iraq for nearly 13 of the 15-month mobilization.http://www.military.com/HomePage/UnitPageHistory/1,13506,103477%7C819800,00.html On December 3, 2014, Battery A (Forward) was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation along with the 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery Regiment for meritorious service during the deployment. Headquarters and Headquarters Battery of the 103d Field Artillery Brigade was mobilized in August 2004, was sent to Iraq, and served until August 2005. C Battery, 1-103d deployed to Iraq from September 2007 to September 2008. The Headquarters of the 103d Field Artillery Brigade was inactivated on September 6, 2008. As a result, the 1st Battalion, 103d Field Artillery was reassigned to the 197th Field Artillery Brigade (New Hampshire Army National Guard) in its operational chain of command and to the 43rd Military Police Brigade (Rhode Island Army National Guard) in its administrative chain of command. At the same time as the inactivation of the 103d Field Artillery Brigade, the 1207th Transportation Company and the 1043d Maintenance Company were consolidated to form the 1207th Forward Support Company (FSC) to provide logistical and maintenance support to 1st Battalion, 103d Field Artillery. As of 2019, 1st Battalion, 103d Field Artillery continues to serve in the Rhode Island National Guard. The 1st-103d consists of five units: Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, Batteries A, B and C, and the 1207th Forward Support Company (FSC). Veterans association In the post World War II era, the name \\"Providence Marine Corps of Artillery\\" has been used by a private non-profit entity that functions as the de facto veterans association of the 103d Field Artillery. (Its membership is primarily current and former members of the 103d Field Artillery with a select group of other individuals.) It holds a long term lease on the historic Benefit Street Arsenal which houses numerous artifacts that commemorate the history of the 103d Field Artillery. The Arsenal is also used for meetings of Elisha Dyer Camp 7 of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW) and the annual encampment of the Rhode Island Department of the SUVCW.

The victims have a little difficulty walking, but no other harm. According to Rin Adashino, this book is the oldest record of the sunekosuri. According to folklore from Ibara in Nankaichi town within this city, sunekosuri would appear beside a shrine called Iry≈ç-d≈ç, and it would move through the space between the legs of pedestrians and would take the shape of a dog. In Yoshii, Shitsuki District, Okayama Prefecture, a similar spirit called sunekkorogashi (meaning \\"make lower legs fall over\\"). A legend states that it would slip into darkness at night and pull on people's legs, making them fall over. Children were made to fall over and hurt their noses. In Media They have been given various appearances in fictional works. In Mizuki Shigeru's manga GeGeGe no Kitar≈ç, it takes on the appearance of a cat rolled into a ball. People who claimed to have actually witnessed one often claim that \\"it was like a cat\\". Y≈çkai researcher Yamaguchi Binatar≈ç claimed that this was because of Mizuki Shigeru's influence.

The first Issue, Across Thin Ice, was released in 2011. As of 2015, a second issue named Under Dark Skies is still in progress, according to the official website. The graphic novel has an official tabletop game, Nordguard: The Card Game. The cover page to the first volume of the Nordguard trilogy, published in 2011 by Sofawolf Press, and featuring Pi, the lead dog, as well as her point dog and second-in-command, London. Plot The adventure story takes place in an early 20th century alternate North America, in a desolate Arctic frontier known as the Northern Territory. It is a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals instead of humans. The plot focuses on a sled dog team, led by a Border Collie named Pi, of the Nordguard Elite, which is a search and recovery organization responsible for cutting trails, carrying the mail, and rescuing lost travelers. Characters=Pi The lead sled dog of her team, Pi is only her nickname, her real name is thus far unknown. Pi is extremely ambitious, courageous, and clever, and is a natural born leader well respected by everyone on her team, especially London, who may have a crush on her. She was born and raised down south in the farming country of the Midwest, and her father was a reputed lawman of the West, who, after retiring, taught her to shoot. Her ambitious nature eventually led her to the last unconquered frontier of the North, where she seems right at home. London London is the point dog and second in command of Pi's team. Out of everyone on the team, London is the most mature, serious-minded, and logical, who rarely speaks unless he has something important to say. First a guide, and then a teacher, London has been with the Nordguard for more than a decade, but perhaps due to his overly-cautious nature, has never been offered to lead his own team. However, he does not seem angered about this, and instead seems to trust and care more about Pi's safety and well-being, occasionally to her annoyance. Nickel Nick for short, is the team's scout, as well as the youngest and newest addition to the team. He has a very adventurous and clever spirit and also provides most of the comic relief, possessing a very witty and snarky attitude as well as a penchant for storytelling. Before running away and coming up North in search of adventure, Nickel lived a very stuffy, privileged, high society life which he mostly loathed. Geri Geri is the twin brother of Freki, and like her, serves as a wheel dog on Pi's team. He's rather brutish, simple, and despite having a large appetite and short temper, is very loyal to both his sister and Pi, willing to risk his life to protect either. He and Freki were born and raised in the harsh land of Thule to the Northeast of the Northern Territory, and he, like his sister, never speak of their past and how or why they left Thule. Freki The twin sister of Geri, and like him, serves as a wheel dog on Pi's team. Unlike her more simple-minded brother, Freki is considerably more attentive and intelligent, but perhaps just as quiet and mysterious. She considers Pi her equal rather than a superior. Lt. James McKay Though not an official member of Pi's team, he is a supporting character in Across Thin Ice and Under Dark Skies, and serves as a medic on team. He is generally kindhearted and well-meaning, but also very sensitive and naive, not fully at home in the arctic wastes. He is a teetotaler and does not drink, due to his abusive drunkard dad who died of alcohol poisoning when he was just a pup. Oleg Kutakov A Russian boar who serves as a ranking corps member. He is very stubborn, brash, and enjoys alcohol. In the first volume, Oleg, perhaps unwittingly, hints that he may possess more information regarding the situation at Tartok Mine than he is willing to reveal to the rest of the team, giving him the most secretive and insidious agenda out of all of the main characters. Nordguard: The Card Game Released in 2012, Nordguard: The Card Game is a cooperative map-building card game with role-playing game elements. It features new artwork from Tess Garman and Teagan Gavet, as well as art provided by Chromamancer. It was created by Tempe O'Kun and developed by ThinkTank Games. In the game, a team of players must work together to cross a random-generated map, with each of the seven main characters from the graphic novel having different abilities. Various promotional cards have been given out at furry conventions since its premiere, adding further characters, items, events, and locations. As of Anthrocon 2014, new promotional cards were still being released. Reception Critical reception of the Nordguard series has largely been positive, with many reviewers particularly praising the series beautifully detailed art. Jim DeVries of IGN rated Across Thin Ice 8.0 out of 10, signifying \\"Great.\\" He calls it \\"exciting, funny, and one of the best drawn Indie books I've ever seen.\\" At Flayrah, Fred Patten called it a \\"very satisfactory first installment of a tense thriller which is bound to enhance Garman's and Gavet's already stellar reputation.

History  Fox Sports Latin America was available in Chile as two simulcast feeds, which were \\"Fox Sports B√°sico\\" and \\"Fox Sports Premium\\", inheriting the Panamerican Sports Network's (PSN) commercial structure in that country after its demise in 2001 as PSN's owner, \\"Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst\\", formed a joint venture with Fox Sports International named Panamerican Sports Holding (PSH), which in turn formed a joint venture with Liberty Media and Argentine company Torneos y Competencias named \\"Fox Pan American Sports\\" that took control of the Latin American Fox Sports channels from News Corporation. Thus, Fox Sports southern feed broadcasting from Argentina started airing on PSN's slots. At the time, Fox Sports Premium was the intact broadcast of the Latin American channel broadcasting from Argentina, while Fox Sports B√°sico was a simulcast with no live programming, relegated to low-tier television packages. In November 2013, the channel was launched replacing Fox Sports B√°sico with original programming produced in Chile. In 21 October 2014, Fox Sports Premium stopped being a mirror feed of Fox Sports LA and starts rebroadcasting Fox Sports Chile programming with live events. 7 months later, on 4 May 2015, Fox Sports Premium was rebranded as Fox Sports 1. Until December 2019, the Fox Sports channels were bundled into a premium pack labelled \\"Fox Sports Premium\\" which consisted on Chilean-made Fox Sports 1 and Latin American Fox Sports 2 and 3. It was the only country in the region to sell the network this way. Due to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company, Disney took control of Fox Sports. As one of its conditions was to relinquish the network due to anti-monopoly policies by the governments of Mexico and Brazil (Disney already owned ESPN which broadcast 3 channels in Latin America), it announced to close Fox Sports' Chilean, Colombian, Uruguayan and Peruvian local feeds. Fox Sports Chile and Fox Sports 1 closed down on 15 December 2019, with Fox Sports 1 being replaced by Fox Sports Latin America, while Fox Sports Chile turning into a Fox Sports LA feed with no live programming again.

They possessed imperial immediacy, having no lord but the Emperor, but were not estates. They were unencircled and did not have representation in the Imperial Diet. In all these respects they were similar to the Imperial Knights. The inhabitants of Imperial Villages were free men. The Imperial Villages‚Äîrelics of the royal demesne during the era of the Hohenstaufen‚Äîwere all located in southern and western Germany and in Alsace. Originally there were 120 villages, but this number was greatly reduced during the early modern period. At the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, forty Imperial Villages in Alsace passed to France. In this Alsatian group were several even smaller entities known as Imperial Hamlets (Reichsweiler). At the time of the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, the final Imperial reform in 1803, only five Imperial Villages remained: Gochsheim, Sennfeld, Holzhausen, Soden and Sulzbach. Holzhausen was a condominium village, two thirds of which was immediate to the Emperor and the remaining third subject to various landlords. In addition, the Free Men of the Leutkircher Heath in the Allg√§u constituted a free peasant republic often counted among the Imperial Villages. Although constitutionally the smallest entities of the Empire, the size of an Imperial Village varied. Territory of the Free Men of the Leutkircher Heath surrounded the Imperial City of Leutkirch on three sides and its area was nearly four times as large. These villages had preserved their rights of justice and their free status for centuries without force of arms, a \\"testimony to the progressive 'juridification' of the Reich\\". Imperial Valley The Imperial Valley (Reichstal) of the Harmersbach was an immediate territory in the Harmersbach river valley of the Black Forest near the Kinzig, which existed in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Politically, it possessed a similar structure to the Free Men of the Leutkircher Heath, yet was the only officially designated Reichstal in the Empire. The Reichstal was approached from the Free Imperial City of Zell am Harmersbach at the mouth of the valley. Although medieval leases placed the Reichstal under the legal power of Zell, disputes finally led the Emperor Leopold I to dissolve the contract in 1689, and the valley's complete immediacy to the Emperor was recognized in 1718.

It caught fire and crashed with the loss of all aboard on 17 October 1913 before entering service. Design On 18 January 1913 Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, Secretary of State of the German Imperial Naval Office, got Kaiser Wilhelm II to agree to a five-year expansion program of German naval airship strength. A contract was placed for the first airship on 30 January, one requirement being that the craft should be capable of bombing England. The design was heavily influenced by the naval architect Felix Pietzker, who was an advisor to the German Admiralty Aviation Department. Construction started in May. The length and overall height of the ship were limited by the size of the Navy's airship shed at Fuhlsb√ºttel, but Pietzker's proposals enabled the diameter of the airship to be increased without increasing overall height firstly by changing the position of the keel, moving it from outside the main hull structure to within it, and secondly by placing the engine cars closer to the hull. It was powered by four Maybach C-X engines in two engine cars, each car driving a pair of four-bladed propellers which were mounted either side of the envelope via driveshafts and bevel gears. The ship was controlled from a third gondola mounted in front of the forward engine car. Operational history LZ 18 (L 2) LZ 18 was first flown on 6 September at Friedrichshafen, and following a number of trial flights was flown to Johannisthal on 20 September for naval acceptance trial to begin, the flight of about 700 km (438 mi) taking twelve hours. The ship's tenth flight was to be an altitude trial and was scheduled for 17 October. The airship was removed from its shed in the morning but takeoff was delayed because one of the engines would not start. The delay of two hours while the engine was repaired allowed the morning sun to heat the hydrogen, causing it to expand. This caused the airship to ascend rapidly to , when horrified observers on the ground saw a flame leap out of the forward engine car, causing the explosion of some of the gasbags. Halfway to the ground there was a second explosion, and as the wreckage hit the ground further explosions followed as the fuel tanks ignited. Three survivors were pulled from the blazing wreckage, but two died shortly afterwards and the third died that night in hospital. In all 28 men died, including Pietzker, and the new chief of the Admiralty Aviation Department, Korvettenkapit√§n Behnisch, the successor to Korvettenkapit√§n Metzing who had been killed in the L 1 on 9 September. The accident was agreed to have been caused by the rapid ascent leading to venting of hydrogen through the relief valves, which in Zeppelins of the period were placed at the bottom of the bags, without vent trunks to convey any hydrogen let off to the top of the ship. Some of the vented gas was then sucked into the forward engine car, where it was ignited, the fire then spreading to the gasbags. Aftermath The loss of the L 2 occurred six weeks after the loss of the L 1 with most of its crew. The two disasters deprived the Navy of most of its experienced personnel and led to the suspension of the planned expansion program. The death of Korvettenkapit√§n Behnisch led to the appointment of Peter Strasser as the new head of the Admiralty Aviation Department.

The system, first noted as a tropical disturbance on April 17, 1998 east of the Northern Cook Islands, initially moved erratically prior to its designation as Alan upon developing into a tropical cyclone on April 21\\\\. The following day, Alan reached its estimated peak intensity with 10-minute maximum sustained wind speeds of , posing several forecasting challenges due to difficulties in establishing its location and intensity. On April 23, Alan appeared to become sheared with the low-level circulation center displaced about from the nearest atmospheric convection. However, over the next day, after the mid-level trough of low pressure shearing the system moved faster than expected, Alan became better organized. While situated about west-northwest of the French Polynesian island of Tahiti, the system drifted south-southeastward. Early on April 25, Alan passed near to or over the French Polynesian Society Islands of Maupiti, Bora- Bora, and Raiatea. However, strong wind shear pulled the system apart, with visible imagery confirming the system's degeneration into a depression with a fully exposed low-level circulation. The system affected French Polynesia with high winds and torrential rain, causing several landslides on the Society Islands. The landslides resulted in the collapse of two bridges, and also overturned trees, in turn obstructing roads. Overall, ten people died as a result of the system, while thirty others were injured, with a majority of the casualties a result of landslides. On the islands of Raiatea, Taha'a and Huahine, several churches, schools and clinics were damaged, while water and electricity supplies were cut off. On the islands, around 750 houses were destroyed, with 430 and 150 wrecked on Huahine and Ra'iƒÅtea, respectively. Meteorological history On April 17, 1998, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) started to monitor the development of a tropical disturbance east of the Northern Cook Islands. Before the FMS initiated advisories on the system on April 19, the system moved erratically; it later developed into a weak depression while it located about north of Manihiki Atoll in the Northern Cook Islands. Over the next couple of days, the system slowly moved northwards, gradually organizing, with gale-force winds developing in its southern quadrant on April 20. Over the next day, the system developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, and the FMS subsequently named the system Alan at 1800 UTC. By this time, the cyclone, located about east-southeast of Manihiki, started to move westwards. On April 22, the FMS estimated that Alan reached its peak intensity with 10-minute maximum sustained wind speeds of 75 km/h (45 mph), just as the system started to pose several forecasting challenges due to difficulties in establishing its location and intensity. Later that day the Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC) started to issue warnings on Alan and accidentally assigned it the designation 32P as opposed to 36P, estimating peak 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 85 km/h (50 mph). On April 23, the system appeared to become sheared, with the low-level circulation center displaced about from the nearest atmospheric convection. As a result, the FMS reported Alan's weakening into a depression, while the NPMOC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system. Over the next day, as a mid-level trough of low pressure shearing Alan moved faster than expected, the depression became better organized and developed favorable upper-level outflow. As a result, the NPMOC initiated advisories on the system again on April 24, and later that day, the FMS reported that Alan re-intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone. While located about west-northwest of the French Polynesian island of Tahiti, the system moved south-southeastward under the influence of an upper-level anticyclone located to its east. Early on April 25, Alan passed near to or over the French Polynesian Society Islands of Maupiti, Bora-Bora, and Ra'iƒÅtea. As the system moved near Bora Bora, a maximum wind gust of and a pressure observation of were recorded, indicating the minimal strength of Alan; however, the wind gust was stronger than that expected of similarly intense tropical cyclones. It was later speculated that squalls within Alan's convective feeder band may have been responsible for the stronger wind gusts. On April 25, strong wind shear pulled the system apart, with visible imagery revealing a fully exposed low-level circulation. As a result, the FMS reported that the system weakened into a depression at 1800 UTC that day, while located about west-northwest of Tahiti. The NPMOC subsequently reissued their final advisory early the next day as the system drifted south-southeastward while located west of Tahiti. Preparations and impact Cyclone Alan produced high winds and torrential rain over French Polynesia between April 24 and 25, causing several landslides on the Society Islands, resulting in the collapse of two bridges and obstruction of roads by fallen trees. Damage associated with the system was mainly confined to the Leeward Islands of Bora Bora, Tahaa, Ra'iƒÅtea and Huahine, which had all been damaged by Cyclone Osea earlier in the season. Overall, ten people died as a result of the system, while thirty others were injured, with the majority of the casualties occurring due to landslides. On Bora Bora, wind gusts of up to were reported, while on Tahaa, wind gusts of up to were reported. On the islands of Ra'iƒÅtea, Tahaa and Huahine, several churches, schools and clinics were damaged, while water and electricity supplies were cut off. On the islands, around 750 houses were destroyed, with 430 and 150 wrecked on Huahine and Ra'iƒÅtea, respectively. On Huahine, the extent of the damage, along with a sharp dip on the Uturoa barograph trace, suggested that a tornado may have been spawned in one of Alan's convective bands. In the system's aftermath a, 60-person relief team was deployed from Tahiti to the affected islands to assist with emergency operations. The French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin both sent messages of support to the Leeward Islands, and in French Polynesia, the system was considered to be one of the worst natural disasters in the islands' history. A few days after Cyclone Alan impacted the islands, Cyclone Bart caused an additional ten deaths and some minor damage to the French territory. During December 1998, the European Community Humanitarian Office responded to a government appeal, providing for tents, medical aid, food and clothing.

Life and work Neher began to study painting in 1822 in Stuttgart, under Johann Heinrich von Dannecker und Philipp Friedrich von Hetsch, but received his primary instruction at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich with Peter von Cornelius. This was followed by four years in Rome, where he cultivated contacts with the Nazarene movement, led by Friedrich Overbeck und Philipp Veit. In 1832, he returned to Munich, where he painted the huge fresco that adorns the arch of the Isartor, depicting the triumphal entry of Emperor Louis after his victory at the Battle of M√ºhldorf. In 1836 he was summoned to Weimar, to decorate two rooms of the Grand Ducal Palace with murals. He worked there, off and on, for eleven years. In 1841, he became Director of the Academy of Visual Arts in Leipzig. He was later induced to return to Stuttgart, where he became a Professor at the Royal Art School. He was promoted to Director in 1854, but continued to produce many large oil paintings, mostly on religious subjects. Arguably, however, his best work involved a series of large glass paintings for stained-glass windows; six for the Stiftskirche, three for the chapel in the Old Castle and one each for the Leonhardskirche, the Greek Chapel in the New Castle and the Johanneskirche. In 1852, he was awarded the Knight's Cross, First Class of the Order of the Crown (W√ºrttemberg), which conferred a title of nobility.Hof- und Staatshandbuch des K√∂nigreichs W√ºrttemberg 1877, Seite 26 In 1878, The Staatsgalerie Stuttgart acquired the frames and designs for his windows.

The sugar battery generates electric current by the oxidation of the glucose unit of maltodextrin. The oxidation of the organic compound produces carbon dioxide and electrical current. 13 types of enzymes are planted in the battery so that the reaction goes to completion and converts most chemical energy into electrical energy. The experimental results have shown that the sugar battery of the same mass can store at least two times, up to ten times electrical energy than the traditional lithium-ion battery can. The sugar battery is expected to be the next general type of mobile electric power source and the possible power source for electric cars. But the sugar battery's output voltage(0.5V) is lower than that of the lithium-ion battery (3.6 V), which causes its electric power (the rate of electrical energy transfer) to be low. Sony, a Japanese corporation, first published the theory of sugar battery in 2007. A research team led by Dr. Y.H. Percival Zhang at Virginia Tech provided the latest version of it in 2014.  History  Sony, a Japanese corporation, first published the theory of sugar battery in 2007. This type of sugar battery is air-breathing and utilizes the oxygen as the oxidizing agent. The battery achieved expected high energy density and reasonable output voltage. Then the company shifted its researching direction in 2012 to the paper battery, which uses paper as fuel. After 2013, Sony didn't release more information about their research project on the biobattery. A research team led by Dr. Y.H. Percival Zhang at Virginia Tech started the project of the sugar battery in 2009. The team first focused on the connection with the hydrogen economy. In 2014, they published their research on the sugar battery that utilizes enzymes in oxidization. This type of sugar battery reached a high energy density. The sugar battery was expected to be realized in an application in 3 years. In 2017, Dr. Y.H. Percival Zhang was arrested by the FBI (has been released in 2019). The federal government accused Dr. Zhang of over twenty counts. Dr. Zhang then resigned from his position at Virginia Tech. Since then, Virginia Tech stopped publishing the result of the sugar battery study. In 2019, Dr. Zhang was acquitted of 19 counts but found guilty of conspiring to commit federal grant fraud. Since 2014, Several Chinese universities, including Zhejiang University and Tianjin University, started working on researches on the sugar battery.  Potential benefits  Compared to the currently widely used lithium-ion battery, the sugar battery has potential benefits in many aspects.  Safety  Compared to the traditional lithium-ion battery, sugar battery does not require toxic metals in manufacturing and releases only carbon dioxide gases. The production of the standard lithium-ion battery would require several metals, including but not limited to lead (Pd), Cadmium (Cd), and Chromium (Cr). The leakage of these metals accumulates inside the vegetables and animals that humans depend on and finally reach humans. Besides, overheating may cause the lithium-ion battery to release up to 100 types of harmful gases to the human body. In some instances, the rechargeable lithium-ion battery explodes to cause a physical casualty.  Availability of fuel  The primary fuel of the sugar battery, maltodextrin, can be enzymatically derived from any starch, such as corn and wheat. Therefore, maltodextrin is renewable. In contrast, the primary constructing block of the lithium battery, lithium carbide, is an unrenewable compound that occurs naturally in the earth. To obtain it, manufacturers need to mine, extract, and purify.  Environmental friendliness  The products of oxidation reaction inside the sugar battery are mainly water, carbon dioxide, and recyclable adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Whereas the disposal of lithium batteries produces heavy metals that contaminate the soil. According to the field experiments, several vegetable species extract the heavy metals from soil and store concentrated metals inside. The carbon dioxide produced by the sugar battery does not contribute to the crisis of greenhouse gas, because the sugar battery uses bio-fuel that is carbon-neutral. Since the production of the fuels involves the photosynthesis of plants, which removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the new greenhouse gas released is counted as a net-zero carbon footprint.  High energy density  The complete oxidation reaction of unit glucose in 15% maltodextrin solution enables the sugar battery to have an energy density of 596 Ah kg‚àí1, which is about two times higher than that of the widely used lithium-ion battery(~270 Ah kg‚àí1). In application, this means that the lifetime of the battery increases. Alternatively, the mass and volume of the battery reduce.  Drawbacks  As a newly invented idea, the sugar battery is not well developed yet. It has several drawbacks in the current state.  Relatively low voltage  Though the output voltage of sugar battery (0.5 V) exceeds that of former enzymatic fuel batteries by the use of various enzymatic catalysts, it is still much lower than that of the commonly used lithium-ion battery (3.6 V). That results in low electric power. In application, it means that the sugar battery takes more time to charge the appliance than the lithium-ion battery does.  Water requirement  The production of the fuel of the sugar battery and the reaction inside the sugar battery require water to complete. If the battery is going to be used widely around the world, it will undoubtedly lead to a requirement for a considerable amount of water. Under current conditions, the consequence will be further intensifying the water scarcity.  Design  The design of the sugar battery is based on the theory of the primary cell. The main components of a sugar battery are an anode, a cathode, a membrane, and a synthetic pathway. The oxidation reaction happens in the anode side where the fuel, maltodextrin, is oxidized. Electrons are released from the fuel and go through the wire connected to the cathode, forming a direct electrical current. Electrical appliances are installed between anode and cathode so that the electrical current powers the appliance.  Anode  The redox reaction that produces the electrical current happens in the synthetic pathway, where 13 enzymes, such as glucose 6-phosphate and phosphoglucomutase, act as catalysts (the substance that is both reactant and product). The fuel, maltodextrin, is divided from polymer to monomer and then oxidized into carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions during four reactions. The reactions involve the enzymatic catalysts, but since they act both as reactant and product, the amount of the enzymes does not decrease in the end so that they can keep facilitating the reaction. At the end of the reaction, One glucose unit and a certain amount of water can produce 24 electrons. The electrons then flow to the cathode through the wire, causing an electrical current flowing from cathode to anode.  Synthetic pathway  The synthetic pathway is composed of 13 enzymes to ensure the redox reaction goes into completion (that is, 24 electrons produced per glucose unit). By adding all these catalytic enzymes into the pathway, the overall chemical equation goes as: C6H10O5+7H2O‚Üí24e‚àí+6CO2+24H+ Theoretically, one maltodextrin's glucose unit (C6H10O5) generates 24 electrons, which makes the sugar battery's maximum current density 35% higher than the maximum current density of a similar system based on 2 dehydrogenases. Practically, the researchers at Virginia Tech measures the faraday efficiency (the percent of measured output against theoretical output) of the sugar battery's redox reaction. The outcome was 97.6¬±3.0% under oxygen-free conditions for the anode compartment, suggesting high efficiency in the electron transmission. Different from the natural pathway, which utilizes NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)-dependent enzyme, the synthetic pathway makes use of the other cytosolic enzymes to mediate the reaction. As a result, the sugar battery does not depend on the use of complex organic chemicals(for example, adenosine triphosphate), which are expensive and unstable.  Improvements  The researchers developed the design of the sugar battery from the prototyped enzymatic fuel cells, which use enzymes as catalysts in the redox reaction. Based on the design of regular enzymatic fuel cells, the sugar battery employs several methods to enlarge the effect produced by the enzymes so that the overall efficiency of the battery is improved.  Non-immobilized enzymes  The enzymes in sugar battery are no more fixed to the electrode, nor entrapped in a limited space near the electrode. The enzymes in the sugar battery can move freely in a larger space and retain the enzymatic activity. To sustain high-speed mass transfer, the researchers immobilized vitamin K3 to the electrode. The corresponding experiments suggest that the non-immobilization method helps the sugar battery to reach a higher and more stable energy density level than the regular enzyme fuel cells with immobilized enzymes. Hence, the energy density of the sugar battery increased so that the battery life extended.  Thermoenzymes  Thermoenzymes, enzymes with high thermostability, are used as the non-immobilized enzymes to ensure stability. In the sugar battery, the thermoenzymes are produced by escherichia coli, a kind of bacterium. Then the enzymes are purified through heat precipitation method and put into use.  Synthetic catabolic pathway  The oxidation reaction inside the sugar battery happens in a synthetic catabolic pathway, which contains 13 enzymes. This pathway is constructed as air-breathing rather than closed so that the researchers ensure the air pressure inside the battery stable and the oxidation reaction goes into completion. The enzymes act as catalysts so that the total amount of them remains the same. Therefore, the overall reaction consumes only the fuel and water while the enzymes recycle in the system. According to the lab experiments, the sugar battery reaches an electron-transmission efficiency of almost 24 electrons per monomer glucose, which is the basic unit of organic fuels. In comparison, the oxidation reaction in the prototyped enzymatic fuel cells could only generate 2 electrons per glucose unit, resulting in low energy density.

It follows the story of two boys whose mentally unstable father, who is an ex serviceman, takes them on holiday but suspicions arise. Plot Fifteen-year-old Dillon and his ten-year-old brother Robbie were home alone when Robbie received a telephone call from their father who they had not seen for two years after he beat up Dillon and his mother. Their father said he wanted to take them on holiday saying that their mother said it was OK despite his restraining order. Robbie was excited about the idea but Dillon was suspicious. Dad came round in a brand new 4x4 and dressed in his army gear. After talking to their father Dillon decided to go but left a note on his bed just in case. When they stopped at a motorway service station Dillon decided to call Mum‚Äôs boyfriend Andy as Mum left her mobile at home and he did not have her office number but Dad removed the battery and the SIM card from Dillon‚Äôs mobile and Robbie left his at home. When they arrived at Gardle Head they set up camp near the cliff top and slept in a hollow. In the morning after breakfast Dad set up two snares to catch rabbits for dinner then they went swimming and skipping stones on the beach. That evening Robbie was squeamish about eating the rabbit due to his vegetarianism but accepted the meat to please his Dad. When Dad sent Dillon to the car to get drinks he found the note he left for Mum which Dad had removed before they left and a shotgun in a black leather case. The next morning Dad saved the scrambled egg for Robbie whilst Dillon and their Dad ate the cold leftover rabbit. They spent the rest of the morning building a sandcastle on the beach and in the afternoon they lazed around on the top of the cliff. On their way to Dartley for the evening Dillon went into a shop for ice creams and saw photographs of him and Robbie on the front page of a newspaper. When they got to Dartley they had a huge fish and chip supper and went to the funfair. On the way out from Dartley Dad noticed photos of himself and the boys on the television whilst passing a Chinese takeaway. Before bed Dad got the boys to say the prayer Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep with the line If I die before I wake. Dillon saw Dad acting strangely and fearing that their father was mentally ill again and was about to kill them Dillon woke Robbie and led him down to the beach and hid behind a rock in the sea. Dad could be heard singing the nursery rhyme Bye, baby Bunting. When Dillon was sure it was safe they went back to the top of the cliff. As they passed the camp Dad came out of hiding and led them to the edge of the cliff with the shotgun about to shoot them. At the last minute Dad wondered what he was doing and shot himself. He got blown off the edge and his body was lost at sea. The two boys walked to the road and were stopped by a passing police car where they were reunited with their mother. Six weeks later Dad‚Äôs body washed up on a beach 50 miles south of Gardle head. The two boys and their mother decided not to go to the funeral but changed their minds on the night before. At the service they met a fellow mourner called Steve Selby who was in the army with Dad. According to Steve, Scott saved his life when he was wounded and trapped by enemy fire but the war messed up a lot of good men such as Scott.

However, similar to the public sector, private health services are offered at a relatively low cost with a shared emphasis on quality of care and quality improvement. Current History The need for improved primary healthcare strategies was recognized during the 1980s. A formalized assessment of the health sector was not approved by the Government of Belize (GoB) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) until 1994. Two years later, the MoH launched a National Health Plan, \\"Quest for Equity\\", which included an analysis of the major health conditions and determinants of health impacting Belize. The results revealed a number of problems surrounding the health sector and identified key policy areas and priorities for improving the healthcare system. The issues identified in the diagnostic report laid the foundation for government initiated Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP), which was implemented in 2000. The primary objectives of the reform project included increasing access to care, improving quality of care, and ensuring the efficient and equitable delivery of care across both health sectors. One of the major accomplishments of the reform project included the establishment of four health regions (northern, central, western, and southern health region) designated to provide health services to distinct geographical areas across Belize. All four health regions offer primary care and secondary care services. Only the Central Health Region, which serves the largest population in Belize, offers tertiary care services [see Health care delivery for description of levels of care].Ministry of Health, Belize.

Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital is considered to be the premier public healthcare provider in Belize.Medical Care in Belize: Retrieved February 4th, 2014 from: http://www.belize.com/medicalcareinbelize However, due to funding issues, the hospital has faced many challenges with equipment problems, medical supply shortages, and operation management problems. Other Districts Outside of Belize City, there are seven additional hospitals (located within the capitals of each of the seven other districts) that provide public healthcare. Among the seven district capital hospitals there are three regional hospitals: the Southern Regional Hospital in Dangriga, the Northern Regional Hospital in Orange Walk Town, and the Western Regional Hospital in the nation‚Äôs capital of Belmopan. Together, these regional hospitals provide more services to the public than the capital hospitals of Corozal and Toledo district. Rural Healthcare Belize has a network of approximately 60 public health clinics, with a total of 700 public hospital beds, that provide primary medical and dental care to rural areas. Most of these health clinics suffer from inadequate staffing, lack of financial resources to handle the patient volume, and a lack of equipment and medicine. As a result, there is reduced access to (quality) care. An additional challenge surrounds the tendency for individuals residing in rural areas to utilize non-western medicine for their health needs rather than seeking publicly available health services. This creates problems in fully assessing the standard of healthcare in Belize and thus delays medical statistics requested by the United Nations and other interested parties. Mental Health In the 1990s, Belize introduced a program in which psychiatric nurse practitioners were trained and integrated into community-based care. Today, mental health services are available in district hospitals throughout the country.Killion, C., & Cayetano, C. (2009). Making mental health a priority in Belize. Archives of Psychiatric Nursing, 23(2), 157‚Äì165. Most inpatient psychiatric services are provided at Rockview Hospital, the national mental hospital based in the Central Region. Mental Health services are also provided in the acute psychiatric ward in Belmopan Hospital, located in the Western Region. Psychotropic medications are available in all district hospitals as well as in the polyclinic located in Belize City. Availability of psychotropic drugs is intermittent and patients sometimes need to purchase their own medications. In terms of medical staff, there are two psychiatric nurses allocated to provide mental health services in seven of the eight district hospitals. The introduction of psychiatric nurse practitioners has facilitated numerous improvements including: a reduction in the number of admissions to the psychiatric hospital, an increase in outpatient services, and the development of community-based mental health prevention and promotion programs. Private Healthcare The government of Belize, with assistance from the European Union and United Nations, has undertaken a major restructuring of the healthcare system. In 1990, the private sector became an increasingly important player in service delivery, providing services to approximately 15% of the population. Private healthcare for many people in Belize continues to play an increasingly important role. Today, the private sector provides some additional tertiary care and imaging services not available in the public system. Persons in need of these services can purchase out of pocket from the private sector or the MoH can purchase these services on their behalf. Private institutions also accept medical insurance plans. In addition, P4P contracts have been implemented in Belize, via the NHI program, in order to improve quality care. Private Hospitals and Clinics The country has three main private hospitals. La Loma Luz Hospital is a private institution run by the Seventh Day Adventist mission. Belize Medical Associates is a 25 bed private hospital that offers radiology and neurological services.Belize Medical Associates: Retrieved February 4th, 2014 http://www.belizemedical.com/about-us.html Universal Health Services is also another private healthcare facility in Belize City. In total Belize has 100 private hospital beds. Belize‚Äôs private healthcare sector is divided into nonprofit and for-profit facilities. Belize Medical Associates and Universal Health Services are both for-profit hospitals. La Loma Luz Hospital is a non- profit hospital. In addition, there are over 50 for-profit clinics and four nonprofit clinics spread throughout Belize. Half of these private clinics are located in Belize City. The overlap between private and public is common. Government institutions usually assist private facilities when they lack equipment for a fee. Roughly 14 percent of Belize‚Äôs health care staff work in both sectors. Future Goals Some key national health priorities include: *Non-communicable diseases and lifestyle related problems *HIV/AIDS *Prevention and management of violence (domestic violence and child abuse) *Health promotion *Sexual and reproductive health *Maternal and Child health (Maternal and Infant mortality, EPI) *Epidemiology *Health Information Systems (BHIS, Vital registration, health accounts, WinSig) *Health sector reform *Environmental health *Disaster preparedness and management Health status There are a number of health conditions prevalent in Belize. The most common conditions include: malaria, dengue fever, gastroenteritis, cholera, and HIV/AIDS. Since Belize is a developing country, many of these conditions are related to issues surrounding, infrastructure, standard of sanitation, and are reflective of the general lack of education and awareness about how these conditions are acquired and transmitted.Global AIDS Country Progress Report: Belize. Retrieved February 5th, 2014 from: http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/knowyourresponse/countryprogressreports/2012countries/ce_BZ_Narrative_Report[1].pdf Historically, malaria has caused major problems in Belize. Although treatment for Malaria has improved dramatically over the years, there are still concerns about future outbreaks. Similar concerns surround dengue fever, cholera, and HIV/AIDS. Due to the relatively fragile infrastructure and low population, an outbreak of HIV/AIDS or any of the other medical conditions noted above may impact the population size as well as the human resources. National Concerns Despite a number of challenges, the Belizean government has made significant changes to the healthcare system. As a result of these changes, Belize has shown marked improvements in a number of areas, including vaccine preventable deaths. For example, there have been no reported cases of measles since 1991 or poliomyelitis since 1987. The last case of neonatal tetanus was reported from Stann Creek District in 1997 and the last case of non-neonatal tetanus was in a three-year-old from Orange Walk District in 1998. The last case of Congenital Rubella Syndrome was reported in 1997. The Measles-Mumps- Rubella (MMR) vaccine was introduced in 1996 and the pentavalent formulation (DPT/Hep/Hib) in 2002. In 2005, MMR coverage was 95%; BCG, DPT, OPV-3 and Hepatitis B coverage were 96%. Some key areas of national concern include: *High prevalence of communicable diseases such as malaria, respiratory diseases and intestinal illnesses. *High mortality rate from non-communicable diseases. Cardiovascular diseases appear as a significant cause of death not only in the elderly but also in the productive age population of 20‚Äì49. *An increase in health problems related to human behavior and lifestyle such as injury, road traffic accident, violence adolescent pregnancy, abortions, STI‚ÄôS HIV/AIDS and suicide. *Anaemia, malnutrition, growth retardation, and diabetes. *Limited equity in terms of access to health care and distribution of resources. *Inefficient health care delivery system. *Limited capacity for policy formulation and regulation of the health sector. *Absence of a human development policy and plan. *Limited quality assurance. *Outdated legislations and areas of health care delivery not yet regulated. *Limited clinical protocols for patient management. *Limited technical operational manuals for program implementation.

Retrieved January 15, 2014. Musilek was invited to shoot Lulu by David Turner, Head of Design and Co-founder of San Francisco- and London-based advertising agency, Turner Duckworth. According to Turner, the concept for Lulu's album imagery was the result of collaboration between Musilek and the agency. Musilek is credited for the album's \\"conceptual\\" imagery, and photographer Anton Corbijn is credited for the album's photographs of Lulu's band members. The album imagery and packaging, which won the 2013 Graphis Gold award, depicts a c. 19th- century mannequin bust housed at the Museum der Dinge in Berlin. Some of the album images pair the bust with the nude body of a woman, and many of the images are superimposed with writing, including lyrics from the album, on their surfaces. Musilek's provocative album imagery was censored by Transport for London, the governing body that manages the city's transport system, from being used as promotional material for Lulu in London Underground stations and trains. The reason for the ban was purportedly because the blood-colored, scribbled writing on the photographs looked too similar to graffiti. The imagery was also controversial due to its visual content, which featured the bust of an armless, yet lifelike, mannequin. According to The Telegraph's culture critic Lucy Jones, the image depicted violence against women. In her article, which has been since removed from the Telegraph‚Äôs website, Jones applauded the censorship of Musilek's photograph, arguing that ‚Äú[t]aking down a poster that could plant a seed in one person‚Äôs head that violence is acceptable is commendable.‚ÄùRobertson, Anna. \\"Lulu banned from the London Underground: frivolous censorship?\\" The Argosy, September 28, 2011.

E. \\"Willie\\" Waggonner (August 7, 1905 - May 9, 1976), was from 1948 until his death in office the sheriff of Bossier Parish in northwestern Louisiana. A native and resident of Plain Dealing, near the Arkansas state line, he was the older brother of U.S. Representative Joseph David \\"Joe D.\\" Waggonner, Jr., who held Louisiana's 4th congressional district seat from 1961 to 1979.\\"Bossier Sheriff Waggonner Dies\\", The Shreveport Times, May 10, 1976 Role as sheriff The son of Joseph David Waggonner (1873-1950) and the former Elizzabeth Johnston (1882-1957), Waggonner was a deputy Under-Sheriff Louis H. Padgett Sr. from 1936-48, when he was elected sheriff at the same time Earl Kemp Long returned to the Louisiana governorship after an absence of eight years. Waggonner was a president of the Louisiana Sheriff's Association and a member of the Louisiana Peace Officers and the National Sheriff's associations. He was affiliated too with the Masonic lodge, Lions International, and the Chamber of Commerce. Early in 1954, The Shreveport Times published a picture taken by its chief photographer, Henry Langston McEachern (1918-2004), entitled, \\"The Sheriff Weeps\\", depicting a heartbroken Waggonner mourning the deaths of two law- enforcement officers. One of Waggonner's deputies, Maurice M. Miller (1912-1954) was shot to death when he confronted a suspect, Ed \\"Man\\" West (1918-1954) in West's residence in Taylortown in Bossier Parish. West then shot to death Shreveport Police Chief Edward Gaston Huckabay (1906-1954), when Huckabay attempted to retrieve Miller's body. Other officers then killed West.The Shreveport Times, February 27, 1954 On December 5, 1959, Waggonner was handily reelected as sheriff in the same election in which his brother, Joe Waggonner, was an unsuccessful candidate for Louisiana state comptroller against eventual winner Roy R. Theriot. Willie Waggonner defeated fellow Democrat Joe B. Mason, an Arkansas native, by a five-to-one margin.The Shreveport Times, December 6, 1959. In 1967, Willie Waggonner, along with his chief deputy and subsequent successor as sheriff, Vol Dooley, were accused of collusion with then Judge O. E. Price and District Attorney Louis H. Padgett, Jr. of the 26th Judicial District (the son of the sheriff whom Waggonner had succeeded to the office) to rig the double murder trial of rodeo star Jack Favor, who was falsely accused of shooting to death an elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Richey, who operated a bait and tackle business near Haughton. Waggonner believed the false testimony of Favor's accuser, Floyd Edward Cumbey. After his conviction was overturned Favor sued for wrongful conviction and imprisonment but settled for $55,000. The actor Robert Norsworthy, under the fictitious name \\"Sheriff Gerker,\\" played Waggonner in the 1998 television movie, Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack. On February 1, 1968, Waggonner hired Wilbert Anderson, the first African-American deputy sheriff in Bossier Parish. Anderson was also the first black licensed bail bondsman in the parish. He retired as the first black detective in the department. In 1973, outgoing Mayor George Nattin of Bossier City was charged by a grand jury under District Attorney Charles A. Marvin of three counts of public bribery. Waggonner booked Nattin, his son, George Nattin Jr., and three other suspects but refused to fingerprint them or take their mug shots. Ultimately, Nattin was acquitted of two charges, and a third was dropped. Death Waggonner died at the age of seventy at his home of an apparent heart attack, the fourth that he had sustained in the last part of his life. He and his wife, the former Nell Evans (1907-1989), had a daughter, Jacqueline Waggonner Gore, known as Jack Gore (born 1940), the widow of the farmer Odie Lee \\"Sonny\\" Gore, Jr. (1940-2016), also of Plain Dealing, who died from complications of a tractor accident. Sheriff Waggonner had a sister since deceased, Mrs. Susie W. Carroll of Dickinson in Galveston County, Texas. He was preceded in death by a second brother, Johnnie J. Waggonner (1908-1968). Services were held at the First Baptist Church of Plain Dealing, with interment in the family plot at Plain Dealing Cemetery. One of his pallbearers, James L.

History First 5 California was created in November 1998 when California voters passed Proposition 10 to invest tobacco tax revenues in programs that would help improve the lives of children in California. Spearheaded by Hollywood producer and political activist Rob Reiner, who acted as the commission's first chairman in 1999 under former Governor Gray Davis, First 5 California was created to use tobacco tax revenues to fund health, safety and early education programs for children age prenatal to 5 years old in California.Bowers, T.

Mission First 5 LA aims to create programs and services for children age prenatal to five. The mission is to increase the number of Los Angeles County children ages 0 to 5 who are physically and emotionally healthy, ready to learn, and safe from harm.About Us. (2012). Retrieved February 1, 2014, from First 5 LA: http://www.first5la.org/About-Us Programs Programs are centered around child, parent/caretaker, and teacher to improve early childhood outcomes in the areas of health and nutrition, early literacy and language development, quality child care, and smoking cessation. Funding Proposition 10 established a 50 cent-per-pack tax on tobacco products towards the healthy development of California's children from prenatal to age five. Declining birth and smoking rates is causing First 5 LA's revenue stream to decrease. First 5 faces decreasing funding due to declining sales of tobacco products and increased administrative fees assessed by the State Board of Equalization for the collection of tobacco taxes. Additional funding declines are fore coming due to state cutbacks. Eighty percent of the commission's resources is divided among California's 58 counties, to be spent according to local needs and priorities. Grants and contracts 2013 First 5 LA's Grants Since 1998, First 5 LA has contributed $800 million in grants and programs to benefit the children of LA County. First 5 LA manages funding for proposals or projects through a transparent Request for Proposal/Request for Qualification process. Proposals or projects can fall under the following categories:Contracting Elements and Performance Based Contracting. (2013). Retrieved February 2014, from First 5 LA: http://www.first5la.org/files/Webinar%20Training%20%28FINAL%29.pdf *Direct Services (Grant Agreement): Services where the grant recipient directly interacts with First 5 LA's target population. *Professional Services (Contract): Services that benefit First 5 LA or where the contract is not directly interacting with target populations. *Vendor Agreements: Routine purchases of goods or services. First 5 LA's funding decisions are guided by the following principles: *Early learning: Programs that improve children's achievement of their developmental potential. *Health: Programs that improve access to and quality of health resources. *Safe children and families: Programs aimed to support families so they can raise their children safely. *Prenatal through three: Programs focused on children from prenatal to the age of three. Controversy First 5 LA has faced controversy due to the 2011 Harvey M. Rose audit that prompted concerns over its financial management. It discovered that while the program was overstaffed, it underspent on programs, resulting in a surplus of $800 million unused funds. Auditors also noted a lack of transparency within the organization. Staff within First 5 LA failed to report over $200 million in contracts and grant awards in one fiscal year, despite the policy that contracts exceeding $25,000 were to be approved by commissioners. The lack of commission oversight made it impossible for auditors to determine whether or not agreements were made for appropriate purposes or qualified vendors and determine whether or not malfeasance had occurred. In response to the audit, First Five LA's former executive director, Evelyn V. Martinez, resigned. Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 to make moves towards to transform First 5 LA from a separate legal entity to a county agency. In response to these challenges, the commission developed an accelerated plan to utilize nearly $400 million in program and services for county children. The plan, which began in 2012, is estimated to serve up to 200,000 children. Some of the initiatives provide services such as expanded health intervention programs, housing for homeless families, expansion of dental care for children age 5 and younger, and partnerships with UCLA to bring dental and vision care to preschoolers. Public health implications First 5 LA's four goal statements carry several public health implications.

Biography  Rippert was born in Offenbach am Main, Germany, and began his career as a stage actor, working in theatres in Baden-Baden, Forst (Lausitz), Bamberg and in Berlin. In 1906, he acted his first film in Baden-Baden for the French Gaumont Film Company. In 1912 he appeared (complete with stick-on beard) as the millionaire Isidor Straus in In Nacht und Eis, one of the first films about the sinking of the Titanic. The film was made by Continental-Kunstfilm of Berlin, where Rippert continued to work as a director, making some ten motion pictures between 1912 and 1914. However, his reputation as one of the pioneers of German silent film rests on some of his later achievements, for example Homunculus and The Plague of Florence.Film Portal Homunculus, produced by Deutsche Bioskop in 1916, is a six-part serial science fiction film involving mad scientists, superhuman androids and sinister technology. The script was written by Robert Reinert, and the film foreshadows various elements of Fritz Lang's 1927 Metropolis, as well as serving as a model for later adaptations of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein rather than the original 1910 version. The subject-matter of Homunculus is similar to an earlier film about a monstrous man-made being, Der Golem (Paul Wegener, 1915). Fritz Lang wrote the script for Rippert's historical epic The Plague of Florence (1919), the first film (of sixteen, as of 2007) to feature the black plague.

Plot Our unnamed narrator is weary from his aimless wandering across the remote cities and roads of the old world. These wanderings began soon after the suicide of his wife Lady Mariel, which was caused by his cruel and vicious temper. He soon stumbles upon Maln√©ant, a city enveloped by fog and the sepulchral tolling of mortuary bells. While roaming the mostly deserted streets the townspeople all tell him they are preparing items for the Lady Mariel's funeral. The tavern and inn he approaches both deny him entry, as all of Maln√©ant's accommodations and services have been appropriated for Lady Mariel's funeral. It is her funeral that is constantly being announced via the tolling of the mortuary bells. Despite the uncanny coincidence, our narrator refuses to suspect a connection to his late wife. He eventually follows the townspeople into the cathedral, whereupon he is stunned to see that it truly is his Mariel lying dead within the coffin. Eventually he leaves the church and immediately loses his way in the labyrinthine city. After hours of roaming, our narrator finally finds his way out of Maln√©ant.

Sampson (May 26, 1910 ‚Äì February 4, 2014) was an American Klallam elder and language preservationist. Sampson was the last native speaker of the Klallam language, as well as the oldest member of the Klallam communities at the time of her death in 2014. She was a member of the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe of Washington. The Klallam language is still spoken as a second language by some members of the four indigenous Klallam communities: the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe, and the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe of Washington's Olympic Peninsula, the Port Gamble Band of S‚ÄôKlallam Indians of Washington's Kitsap Peninsula,as well as the Beecher Bay Klallam of British Columbia, Canada. Biography Sampson was born Hazel Hall to William Hall and Ida Balch Hall on May 26, 1910, in Jamestown, Washington. She was the granddaughter of Chief James Balch, the founder of Jamestown and the namesake of both the town and the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe of Washington. Her parents taught her the Klallam language as a native speaker, though she later learned English as a second language. Her father, William Hall, founded the first Indian Shaker Church on the Olympic Peninsula in Dungeness, Washington, circa 1910. In 1934, Sampson and her husband, Edward C. Sampson Sr., moved from Jamestown to Port Angeles, Washington. There, the Sampsons became one of the thirteen founding families who purchased and owned land on the Lower Elwha Klallam Reservation. She was married to Edward Sampson for 75 years, until his death in 1995. She was also a member of the Jamestown S'Klallam Band, which was established as a separate Klallam political entity during the 1980s. According to Jamestown chairman Ron Allen, Sampson, \\"considered herself a S'Klallam first. She associated closely with all three bands\\" in Washington state. Hazel Sampson was a key contributor in the work to preserve the Klallam language. Timothy Montler, a professor of linguistics at the University of North Texas, began working on Klallam language preservation beginning in 1990. Montler partnered with Jamie Valadez, a Klallam language teacher at Port Angeles High School and member of the Lower Elwha Klallam, compile Klallam language materials and teaching tools. The two began work to save Klallam from potential extinction. Montler and Valdez collaborated closely with local native speaking Klallam, including Hazel and Ed Sampson, Adeline Smith and Bea Charles. In 1999, Montler published several guidebooks and lesson plans aimed at teaching Klallam language basics through storytelling. Montler also published the first Klallam dictionary in 2012 through the University of Washington Press. He used terms and definitions contributed by Hazel Sampson, Smith and Charles to compile the dictionary. Hazel Sampson had declined to be named as an official member of Montler and Valadez's project, citing tradition. However, she collaborated closely with her husband and other members. The researchers believed she understood the Klallam language better than her husband and the other members of the project. According to Valadez, \\"She said, 'This is Ed's work.' She was very traditional.\\" Adeline Smith died in March 2013, leaving Sampson as the last surviving, native speaker of the Klallam language. Hazel Sampson resided in her Port Angeles home until her death in 2014. She died on February 4, 2014, at the age of 103. Her death marked the passing of the last native speaker of Klallam, though some younger members continued to speak it as a second language. According to Klallam cultural teacher Jamie Valadez, \\"She was the last one...[Her death] changes the dynamics of everything...They carry so much knowledge of our culture and traditions.\\" Sampson was survived by her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren; great-great grandchildren and great-great-great grandchildren.

Biography Ferhat Draga was born in Kosovska Mitrovica, Ottoman Empire. He was the brother of Nexhip Draga, another politician mostly known as co-founder of the D≈æemijet party. Ferhat was educated in Istanbul, where he was active together with his brother Nexhip in the movement for the Albanian writings and schools. He supported the Latin script for writing the Albanian language. During the Young Turk Revolution, Galib Bey managed to get Albanian leaders Ferhat Draga, Nexhip Draga and Bajram Curri to attend a meeting at Firzovik (modern Ferizaj) and use their influence to sway the crowd through fears of \\"foreign intervention\\" to support constitutional restoration. He participated in the Congress of Trieste from 27 February to 6 March 1913, where Albanian and Aromanian delegates from all Albanian territories approved a program regarding the Albanian future Sovereign, borders, and economical- political independence of the Albanian state. During World War I, he cooperated with Austro-Hungarian forces, which controlled most of Kosovo. In 1915, he raised around 1,000 volunteers to assist the Austrians on the Eastern Front. In 1915, he became an important figure inside D≈æemijet, and after the death of his brother Nexhip in 1921 he became leader. The party won 14 seats in the elections of 1923. In January 1925, the Dzemijet party came to conflict with the People's Radical Party of Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, and several Albanian leaders including Ferhat Draga were arrested and imprisoned. On the eve of the general elections of the same month he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was however released soon and invited to Belgrade to reach a deal with Pa≈°iƒá, unsuccessfully. In 1927, in the eve of next general elections, he was arrested again and sentenced to another 20 years. Draga still avoided the imprisonment. In the 1930s, he was active with the Muslim Religious Community of the southern Serbia. There he did what he could to oppose the deportation of Albanian Muslims to Turkey. Draga served as well as Mayor of Kosovska Mitrovica. Ferhat Draga had good relations with King Zog of Albania. In the mid 1930s, he would become the leader of a separatist cell located in Mitrovica and composed as well by Xhafer Deva, Shaban Mustafa, and Mustafa Aliu, all from Mitrovica. The cell was in contact with Ismet Kryeziu and Salih Vu√ßit√´rni, both originating in Kosovo and trusted men of Zog inside Albanian politics. Kryeziu and Vu√ßit√´rni had enabled other cells from the Albanian side with the goal of reviving the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo, which had gone into lethargy since the death of Hasan Prishtina and Bajram Curri. Since the Committee former leaders were not a threat for Zog, and the Albanian-Italians relations were stronger, King Zog thought of using the Committee as a leverage in the political endeavors with Yugoslavia. Despite its presence, the committee's work was limited to diplomacy, propaganda, and recruiting, rather than any military activity. In 1941, Draga welcomed the Italian invasion and the accommodation of most of Kosovo into the Albanian state. Meanwhile, the Germans would consider him unreliable and too Italophile. Involved in fights against the Yugoslav partisans during the Albanian insurgency by the end of World War II, he was wounded and died near Kralan village of Gjakova.

Introduced by Ken Corday, Lisa de Cazotte and Greg Meng, and created by Gary Tomlin and Christopher Whitesell, the character is portrayed by former All My Children actress Chrishell Stause. Debuting on August 15, 2013, she ultimately departed the role on March 9, 2015. She returned on February 4, 2019 ‚Äî on a recurring basis. The character exited on November 11, 2019, and Stause briefly reprised the role during on March 4 and July 20, 2020. The character was introduced as a physical therapist brought to Salem by Kate Roberts (Lauren Koslow) to help an ailing Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering) during his rehabilitation; she soon begins to develop a relationship with Rafe, much to the displeasure of Kate, who immediately sets out to discover the secrets that Jordan has been harboring. Stause's performance has been met with critical acclaim, having garnered her a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Performer in a Drama Series in 2020.  Creation  Stause joined Days of Our Lives in early 2013, following a six- year run as Amanda Dillon on All My Children.  Casting  On March 22, 2013, Stause was elated that the once cancelled All My Children, where she played Amanda Dillon from 2005 to 2011, had been revived, but revealed that she could not participate in the reboot because she was already under contract with another daytime soap. However the actress could not speak on the casting at the time. On April 18, 2013, TVLine officially announced that Stause had joined the cast of Days of our Lives in a contract role, with August as a potential air date. However, information about the character was not made available. Stause filmed her first scenes during the week of April 7, 2013. Many suspected that Hartley would be a recast of Cassie Brady (Alexis Thorpe). She said she enjoyed playing such a different role and appreciated that it allowed her to branch out, and that she was offered another \\"more glamorous\\" role, but she chose to take the role of Jordan because it was so different from her previous roles. Stause learned about the role from her manager and when she went in to audition, she found out that they were casting for two separate roles. Actress Jen Lilley revealed that she had also auditioned for the role of Jordan, before she was cast in the role of Theresa Donovan. On October 24, 2014, Stause announced her exit from the series, and last appeared during the March 9, 2015, episode. In August 2018, it was announced that Stause would be returning for as Jordan. She returned on February 4, 2019, and appeared in various stints until November 11 of the same year. She also appeared briefly on March 4 and July 20, 2020. Characterization Hartley told Soapdom.com, that she enjoyed the \\"layers to the character.\\" In an interview with TVLine, she revealed that her character did not wear any makeup. However, Jordan is very serious about her career, and \\"she‚Äôs very no- nonsense. She‚Äôs not there to humor anyone. In fact, she comes across robotic at first.\\" Of her character's introduction, Hartley said Jordan is \\"strong, very smart, very take-charge, all business.\\" She does not care about her physical appearance. Of her character's \\"impersonal\\" demeanor, Stause said, \\"She's not bitchy, she's just very businesslike.\\" Jordan is not \\"meek\\" or \\"sheepish,\\" but instead, \\"She will literally bark you out of the room,\\" she said. Despite the character's onscreen appearance, the series released several publicity photos with Stause looking completely different from her character. The character is \\"definitely working with a good moral compass,\\" Hartley said in an interview with Soaps She Knows. Hartley said Jordan is a \\"good person, because it takes a certain type of person who wants to be a physical therapist and really heal people.\\" Jordan gives \\"tough love, but she gets results.\\" She told About.com that she took the \\"tough love\\" approach from her own sister's physical therapist.  Development = Introduction  In June 2013, Hartley revealed that her character is \\"very opposite,\\" of her All My Children character, Amanda. She said that the character harbors secrets, and also revealed that she shared her first scenes with Galen Gering and Lauren Koslow, who portray Rafe Hernandez and Kate Roberts, respectively. she told On-Air On- Soaps that the secret was a significant one. Of the character's introduction, executive producer Ken Corday said it would be a \\"very slow build.\\" Hartley said the character's slow introduction allowed for viewers to \\"warm up\\" to the character. The character is introduced as a \\"plain Jane\\" physical therapist who joins the staff at Salem University Hospital. Jordan's arrival strikes a nerve with Kate, who thinks she is a man, because of her name. Kate feels threatened because of her \\"friends with benefits\\" relationship with Rafe. She said the character would eventually make a \\"transition,\\" similar to Rachael Leigh Cook's character in She's All That.  Rafe, Kate and Jordan's past  According to Hartley, Rafe is taken aback by Jordan's \\"impersonal\\" demeanor. However, Rafe treats it as a game, doing everything he can to break down the \\"closed-off wall.\\" Though Jordan initially rejects him, Rafe eventually gets her to open up. The turning point for the duo is when Rafe reacts badly to the lack of feedback from Jordan during a physical therapy session. Jordan finally understands that her encouragement could help his recovery, she lets her guard down. Jordan's professionalism becomes a problem when she starts to fall for Rafe. It is kind of a \\"push-pull for Jordan,\\" she said. She said Jordan is \\"definitely scared of her feelings for Rafe,\\" because it is unprofessional to fall for a patient. Rafe jokes about firing Jordan once he is recovered so they can date, and that is when she starts to let her guard down viewers would see the \\"chemistry\\" between the characters. Hartley said that Jordan's dynamic with Kate becomes very \\"antagonistic.\\" According to the actress, Jordan finds Kate \\"overbearing\\" and initially doesn't \\"give her a second thought.\\" However, Jordan gets nervous when Kate starts digging into her past. Of the character's past, she said fans would need to be patient because the story about Jordan's past would take some time to come out. \\"Obviously some things have happened that she needs to run from or that she is afraid of.\\" When Jordan's feelings for Rafe evolve, Jordan becomes much more vulnerable. She revealed to Soaps She Knows that \\"We will see that dynamic come into play where even though she acts like she is not afraid of Kate, we will see that she is slightly afraid of the fact that Kate was able to pull up some stuff from the past and how it could affect her life.\\" With the casting of Jade Harlow in the recurring role of Sheryl, the show began developing and exploring the character's background. In February 2014, it was announced that country singer Justin Gaston had been cast as Jordan's brother, Ben Rogers, with whom she shares a secret past.  Storylines  Jordan arrived in Salem in mid-August 2013, per the request of Kate Roberts (Koslow) to help rehabilitate Rafe Hernandez (Gering), following his being attacked. Originally very guarded and off-putting, Jordan begins to let down her walls around Rafe, much to the chagrin of Kate. As a result, Kate begins to investigate Jordan's past, which does not settle well with her. After sharing her first kiss with Rafe, Jordan begins to pull herself from Rafe once more. At her apartment, she opens a lockbox only to reveal several I.D.'s with different names, all featuring various looks. As Jordan begins to develop a relationship with Rafe, Jordan's old friend Sheryl (Jade Harlow) from Birmingham arrives in town in early 2014, and immediately begins to stir up Jordan's past by connecting with Kate, Rafe, Sami Brady (Alison Sweeney) and Lucas Horton (Bryan Dattilo). Jordan and Sheryl then enter into a conflict, over Sheryl's arrival into town; however both ladies agree to make the best of their rekindled friendship. Kate then involves Lucas in her scheme against Jordan, and during a night out, Kate breaks into Jordan's apartment and discovers her box of hidden I.D.'s; Kate is then caught when Jordan arrives back early. Following her step-father's arrival into town, Rafe and Jordan soon separate and she eventually falls for town bad boy, Chad DiMera (Billy Flynn). They soon breakup following the belief that Chad pursued legal action against her brother and in March 2015, she eventually leaves town following a job offer in New York City. She returned in early 2019 briefly, keeping Ciara Brady and Charlotte DiMera hostage to protect them from changed Ben and pointing all the evidences to him. She is then admitted to the mental asylum, Bayview. During her treatment in Bayview, she reveals a secret to Rafe about giving birth to a child who she named David Ridgeway, giving him the responsibly of looking after her son in her absence.  Reception  Stause's teasing led to much fan speculation on Twitter about what soap she would join. \\"Things will undoubtedly heat up in Salem this summer,\\" Matt Webb Mitovitch said of the casting announcement. Kambra Clifford of Soap Opera Network was very happy about the casting, and announced the news with headline, \\"Chrishell Stause Is Baaaaack!\\" Michael Fairman said Stause's debut was greatly anticipated by viewers and critics. Matt Webb Mitovitch compared the character to the General Hospital characters of Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring) and Sabrina Santiago (Teresa Castillo) and Days's own, Chloe Lane (Nadia Bjorlin) due to her introduction as the \\"ugly duckling.\\" Webb Mitovitch described Jordan as having an \\"icy demeanor.\\" \\"Now the kicker is, Stause is going to be dressed down for the role, no bombshell gowns, or glamor for now! She is an all business therapist,\\" Michael Fairman said of the character's initial introduction. Omar Nobles of TV Source Magazine said of the character, \\"Jordan‚Äôs strong, assertive and focused on her career. She also doesn‚Äôt particularly care about her outward appearance. She may be a ‚ÄòPlain Jane‚Äô but you‚Äôll think the opposite when you see Chrishell Stause‚Äôs new publicity photos!\\" Janet Di Lauro said, \\"Bye-bye lashes and lip gloss. Farewell tight skirts and high heels. From the minute Chrishell Stause stepped foot on the Days of our Lives sound stage as a physical therapist Jordan Ridgeway, she's been the Plane Jane poster child. For the beautiful actress, who turned heads in her previous soap role as Amanda Dillon on All My Children, it's been an adjustment. But she's taking it one dowdy day at a time.\\" Mark Edward Willows said \\"her storyline is so intriguing that you can call her the 'mystery lady.\\" Jamey Giddens said, \\"surprised to see how the soap frumped the gorgeous Stause up for her new gig.\\" TV Buzz's Deanna Barnert described Jordan as a \\"hard- working duckling just begging for a makeover.\\"  References and notes  Category:Days of Our Lives characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2013 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Jordan Ridgeway"},{"id":"41878136","text":"VA-16 was a short-lived Attack Squadron of the U.S. Navy, established at NAS Oceana on 1 June 1955.

Portable stoves in modern times can be divided into several broad categories based on the type of fuel used and the design of the aluminium stoving frame. Unpressurised stoves use solid/liquid fuel placed in the burner before ignition. Combustible stove hangers use a form of volatile liquid fuel in a pressurized burner i.e. bottled gas stoves. They originate from the gravity-fed 1932 \\"spirit\\" stoves or r√©chaud de gaz de dirigeant. Origins The production of the r√©chaud de gaz de dirigeant (Portable gas stove) was commissioned and begun in the workshop of the industrial designer Jue Lafare (born April 7, 1896) in 1932 after he placed his plan for a portable gas cooker before the French Army two and a half years earlier. Early introduction By 1934 Lafare's portable cooker was in officer ranks and within the next 16 months would come to be a staple of every officer in the French army. Due to fear of common misuse by soldiers of lower ranks obtaining the cookers without consent, the army requested that all instructional writing be placed upon the cookers in English as only the officers were taught fluency in English. Military applications Unfortunately Lafares design, however brilliant, was not enough to stop the German ranks marching over his homeland in 1940 after only 6 weeks. The majority of r√©chaud de gaz de dirigeant were melted down into what can only be assumed as scrap metal for the German war machine. However, from Jeu Lafare's stove the idea was adapted in various forms around the world during World War II and afterwards. Examples can be seen in many military originations around the world today with the American 'Bunga' or Japanese 'Êê∫Â∏ØÁî®„Ç¨„ÇπÁÇäÈ£ØÂô®'. Today there are estimated to be less than 80 of Lafare's original Full Blue French made with English writing r√©chaud de gaz de dirigeant. Although the stove was a wonderful invention, the Germans were incredible in their precision at melting them down in such a systematic way. Rarity As mentioned above, examples of Lafare's original full blue French made r√©chaud de gaz de dirigeant are extremely rare. The War Memorial Museum in Boulogne, France, paid 390EU for the piece pictured above in their collection some 20 years ago. The gas canister is a later 1940s Deutsch army model.

Afroyim became the subject of a landmark 1967 U.S. Supreme Court case, Afroyim v. Rusk. Loss of citizenship, also referred to as loss of nationality, is the event of ceasing to be a citizen of a country under the nationality law of that country. It is a blanket term covering both involuntary loss of citizenship, such as through denaturalization, as well as voluntary renunciation of citizenship. Grounds There are generally two categories of grounds for loss of citizenship. \\"Involuntary loss\\" may occur due to either automatic lapse of citizenship from the citizen for failure to take some action to retain citizenship, or active withdrawal of citizenship by the country. In contrast, \\"voluntary loss\\", often called \\"relinquishment\\" or \\"renunciation\\", is initiated by the citizen. It is not always easy to make a clean distinction between the two categories: loss of citizenship due to an initial cause undertaken voluntarily (for example, voluntarily serving in a foreign military or voluntarily naturalising as a citizen of a foreign country) could be seen either as \\"voluntary loss\\" or \\"involuntary loss\\". The European Union Democracy Observatory, in a study of the nationality laws of thirty-three European countries, found nine broadly-defined cases in which a citizen of a country may lose his or her citizenship: #Voluntary acquisition of another citizenship #Residing abroad on a permanent basis #Fraud in the naturalisation process, including sham marriages, or failure to give up the other citizenship in countries which require that as a condition of naturalisation #Serving in a foreign military or foreign government #Upon adoption by a foreign citizen, or other change in the child's legal relation to the parents such as annulment of maternity/paternity #For a minor, upon the loss of citizenship by the parents #Failure to fulfill conditions, for example in Japan, where Japanese children born with an additional citizenship lose Japanese citizenship if they fail to give up the other citizenship before the age of 22 #Voluntary renunciation Involuntary loss of citizenship does not necessarily mean automatic and immediate loss. Even if a country's laws state that under certain circumstances citizenship is automatically removed, until officials of the government or embassy are informed, that country's government will probably still retain that person's name in its citizenship records. International norms Various international treaties limit the cases in which loss of nationality may occur. In most cases this limits the government's power to deprive the individual of citizenship, but this also may limit the individual's ability to voluntarily make themselves stateless. Article 7 of the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness provides that \\"[l]aws for the renunciation of a nationality shall be conditional upon a person's acquisition or possession of another nationality\\". However, this is not considered a peremptory norm which binds non-signatories to the Convention.

In the early 1960s, he was a member of the citizen group that advised the Portland area Metropolitan Transportation Study Committee.

After the 1971 legislative session, the Oregon House of Representative was re-districted and Martin's home in Lake Oswego became part of District 24. The new district represented much of the area previously covered by District 7. In 1972, he ran for the House seat in District 24, winning with 55 percent of the district's vote.

This allowed him to serve in the legislature's regular sessions in 1975 and 1977 plus two special sessions, one in December 1975 and the other in September 1978. During this period, Martin's Republican colleagues in the state House of Representatives elected him as their leader. Because Democrats held the majority of seats in House, he served as the House minority leader for four years.\\"1975 Regular Session (58th): January 13 ‚Äì June 14\\", Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide, Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, 28 December 2013.\\"1975 Special Session (58th): September 16\\", Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide, Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, 28 December 2013.\\"1977 Regular Session (59th): January 10 ‚Äì July 5\\", Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide, Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, 28 December 2013.\\"1978 Special Session (59th): September 5‚Äì9\\", Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide, Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, 28 December 2013. During the stormy 1977 legislative session, Martin helped build a coalition of Republicans and moderate and conservative Democrats that ultimately stripped the Democratic speaker, Philip D. Lang, of his power. At the beginning of the session, Martin encouraged his Republicans colleagues to vote for conservative Democrat, Dick Magruder, for speaker. As a result, Magruder came within one vote of being elected speaker. While unsuccessful, that effort encouraged further cooperation between the Republican minority and conservative Democrats in the House. The influence of this coalition continued to grow throughout the legislative session. In May 1977, a small group of moderate Democrats joined the coalition. In a quick legislative move, the expanded coalition voted to transfer the speaker's power to the House Rules Committee which was controlled by the coalition leaders. While the speaker was not removed from office, the Rules Committee took control of virtually every aspect of House operations. As a member of the Rules Committee, Martin helped set the legislative agenda for the remainder of the 1977 session.Cogswell, Phil, \\"Members of House Challenge Speaker\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 3 May 1977.Federman, Stan, \\"Legislators, Lobbyists Unsure of House Action, Say Major Delays Likely\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 4 May 1977.\\"Lang wants Caucuses to Pick Interim Panels\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 7 June 1977, p.

Instead, he ran for governor. He faced former governor Tom McCall and state senator Victor Atiyeh in the Republican primary. In his campaign, Martin highlighted his business background and experience as a leader in the state legislature. He emphasized his ability to craft common sense solutions for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of state government without raising taxes.‚ÄúCandidate says Oregon spends too much‚Äù, The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 3 November 1977, p. 5.‚ÄúCandidate criticizes planning, Martin asks for common sense‚Äù, Eugene Register Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 15 November 1977, p.

That was 17 percent of the ballots cast in the Republican primary. He finished third behind Atiyeh (who got with 46 percent of the vote) and McCall (who got 33 percent). Atiyeh went on to defeat incumbent governor Robert W.

In the 2016 census, Innot Hot Springs had a population of 177 people.  Geography  Innot Hot Springs is south-west of Cairns via the Bruce Highway, Gillies Range Road, Lake Barrine Road, State Route 25, State Route 24 and the Kennedy Highway. From further west it can be accessed via the Kennedy Highway. Innot Hot Springs is located on the Kennedy Highway, between Mount Garnet and Ravenshoe in Far North Queensland. It is 5 kilometers south of Mount Gibson. The town is on the northern edge of the locality with the Kennedy Highway passing through it. The Herbert River meanders in a southerly direction through the locality from Millstream to Gunnawarra and Glen Ruth. The confluence of the Wild River with the Herbert River occurs in the north of the locality (east of the town). Nettle Creek flows from Silver Valley to the north through the town and joins the Herbert River to the south of the town. The town was established around three hot mineral springs in the Nettle Creek near the town. The temperature of the springs is between 165-185 ¬∞F. Aboriginal legend According to the Mamu people, the springs were created in the Dreamtime when a large maritime turtle had a hot stone put in her stomach. It hurried out of the sea inland, to this spot, to warm the waters. From that day onwards, it ordered all big turtles were to stay in the sea, while small tortoises would be permitted to live in the freshwater rivers on land. History \\"Mr C. Spranklin, a settler on the Northern Tablelands for nearly half a century, and the host of Innot Springs\\" The hot springs were first discovered by Europeans in the early 1870s when John Atherton was exploring the area for grazing opportunities. However it seems the springs were ignored until 1885 when Charles Overend Garbutt, the owner of Woodleigh Station, rediscovered them and learned from the local Aboriginal people that the springs had healing properties. In the Victorian era, mineral springs were widely believed to have theraputic benefits obtained through bathing in the water and drinking the water. Perceiving the commercial opportunities, a Russian-born man, Antonie Antonevic leased 10 acres around the springs on 1 April 1886. The lease passed through a number of people's hands before it was taken up by (Neil) Charles Spranklin in the late 1890s, who is generally regarded as the major force in developing the springs. By July 1888 there was a two-storey house with bathing sheds by the springs and in February 1891, the leaseholder Henry Faasch was described as being able to accommodate only 12 patients, but was in the process of erecting a hotel. As the water in the springs was too hot for bathing, the hot spring water was piped into bath tubs at 6am each morning and left it to cool until late morning when the guests could comfortably bathe in it. In 1900, Spranklin built four new bathrooms described as \\"a much needed improvement\\". In the 1900s, Spranklin established a cordial factory where he bottled water from the springs and shipped it to Europe as a health treatment. In 1912 it was proposed that the hot springs were one of three \\"beauty spots\\" in the Cairns hinterland that must be preserved; this was prior to legislation to create national parks in Queensland. On 7 October 1918, when Spranklin was absent from the hotel, a fire broke out. The maid Nellie Hogg (Spanklin's step-daughter) initially fought the fire using water from jugs and then, with the help of others, managed to save the hotel, although there was ¬£50 worth of repairs required. On 13 March 1929 Charles Spranklin died aged 75 years in the hospital at Herberton following a 12-month illness. He was buried in Herberton Cemetery on 14 March 1929. In July 1930 James Thomas Spranklin (son of Charles) announced he would take over the hotel, but he died in January 1931. Later that month, Jack and Mabel McBride became the owners of the Springs Hotel. Lower Nettles Provisional School opened circa July 1911. In July 1916 it became a half-time school in conjunction with Coolgarra State School, meaning the two schools shared a single teacher. It closed later in 1916. Innot Hot Springs State School opened on 1 June 1940 and closed on 30 June 1957 due to declining enrolments.

After the end of World War II, he emigrated to Japan, where he lived until his death. Biography=Early life Born on the island of Kauai in the Republic of Hawaii to father Kichizo and mother Haru, both sugar plantation workers, Kurihara moved to the mainland to attend St. Ignatius High School in San Francisco. Following service with the U.S. Army Medical Department in France during World War I, Kurihara went on to Southwestern University in Los Angeles, where he received a bachelor's degree in commercial science. Afterwards he held a variety of jobs in food-related business, until the 1930s when he became the navigator on a Portuguese ship. Internment During World War II, Kurihara was interned at the Manzanar War Relocation Center. In December 1942, Kurihara was part of a five-member committee which organized protests over the arrest of Harry Ueno, an internee accused of the beating of Fred Tayama. The protestors became unruly, and two soldiers fired on the crowd without orders; two men died, and ten others were injured. Kurihara spent about a month in jail, and was further transferred to citizen isolation camps at Moab, Utah and Leupp, Arizona before finally arriving at the Tule Lake Segregation Center. Renunciation and emigration Kurihara was one of 5,725 Nisei, mostly Tule Lake internees, who renounced U.S. citizenship under the Renunciation Act of 1944, and one of 316 who did not seek to restore their citizenship after the war's end.

They often are yellow or yellow-green. To some extent, these organic compounds have displaced cadmium sulfide from the market. They exist as yellow powders of low solubility in water.K. Hunger. W. Herbst \\"Pigments, Organic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley- VCH, Weinheim, 2012.  Production  Synthesis of C.I. Pigment Yellow 12, a diarylide pigment. The formation of these pigments involves the reaction of diazotized aromatic diamines (derivatives of benzidine) with coupling components, typically derivatives of acetoacetanilide. By varying both of these components, a wide variety of pigments have been produced.Lewis, D. M., Modern colorants synthesis and structure. Advances in color chemistry series, Vol. 3. Edited by A. T. Peters & H. S. Freeman, Blackie Academic & Professional, Glasgow, 1995, xii + 245 pp. . Journal of Chemical Technology & Biotechnology 1996, 65, (2), 207-208. A related family of organic pigments are the simpler arylides, which arise from the coupling of monodiazonium salts with the same coupling partners. The molecular structures of these molecules is more conjugated than represented in the images shown below.Barrow, M. J.; Christie, R. M.; Monteith, J. E., The crystal and molecular structures of three diarylide yellow pigments, C. I. Pigments Yellow 13, 14 and 63. Dyes and Pigments 2002, 55, (2-3), 79-89.

Due to their stability, diarylide yellows are used in inks, coatings, and as plastic colorants. The pigment is insoluble. It is a standard pigment used in printing ink and packaging industry. The diarylide yellow pigment Yellow 12 is one of the three main colored pigments used in the four color process of color printing. As such, its use is ubiquitous in printing both in commercial applications and in home color printers, as well as in textile printing.  Toxicity and hazards  Diarylide yellow pigments are considered to be non- toxic. There is, however, evidence that these pigments degrade when exposed to temperatures above 200 ¬∞C to release 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, a carcinogen that is listed in the U.S. EPA‚Äôs Toxics Release Inventory. 3,3‚Äô-Dichlorobenzidine is structurally similar to one of the polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, PCB 11 (3,3‚Äô-dichlorobiphenyl), and some evidence indicates that the use of diarylide yellow pigments introduces PCB 11 to the environment.Rodenburg, L.

McAfee previously taught at several other universities, including serving as Allen-Berenson Visiting Associate Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies at Brandeis University. She has worked extensively in democratic theory, new media, and psychoanalytic theories of the public sphere. McAfee is currently the co-chair of Public Philosophy Network, associate editor of the Kettering Review, and has spent a number of years engaged in political issues in Washington, D.C., both before and during her academic career. Education and career McAfee received a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Texas at Austin in 1986, and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University in 1987. After receiving her initial degrees, before journeying in to academic philosophy, McAfee was an organizer and policy advocate in the Washington D.C. area. She worked for Public Citizen's Congress Watch from 1987 to 1988, was the chairperson of the D.C. local of the National Writers Union from 1988 to 1989, and the vice president at large of the National Writers Union in 1990 and 1991. While working as a public interest activist in Washington, D.C., McAfee began to worry that this work would be in vain if people were not really interested in nor capable of democratic self-government. To address these concerns, she returned to academia to study philosophy. She received a master's degree in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1990, the same year she became associate editor of the Kettering Review. She went on to receive her doctorate in philosophy from the University of Texas at Austin in 1998. McAfee's research gave her cause to believe that democratic self-government is in fact possible, and within a few years of her first book she resumed her research and engagement in democratic practice, including new work in new media, and post-conflict democratization. McAfee began her academic career as a lecturer in political theory in the Department of Government at UT Austin in 1998‚Äì1999, before accepting an appointment as assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, where she served from 1999 to 2003, when she was promoted to associate professor, a position she occupied until 2007. In 2005 she helped found the Future of Public Media Project at American University as part of an initiative funded by the Ford Foundation. After leaving the University of Massachusetts, McAfee accepted a position at the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University, where she stayed from 2008 to 2010, before accepting a dual appointment at Emory University as associate professor of philosophy and affiliate of women, gender, and sexuality studies. In 2013, McAfee was promoted to full professor at Emory. McAfee has accepted a number of temporary academic appointments in addition to her permanent positions. In 2004 she accepted an appointment as the Allen-Berenson Visiting Associate Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies at Brandeis University, before becoming a scholar-in-residence at American University in 2005 (where she stayed on as a research professor in 2006.) McAfee also served as a visiting associate professor of philosophy at George Mason University from 2006 to 2008. McAfee has also served in a wide number of academic administrative roles, including serving as the director of the Gender Studies program and the director of the Honors Program, both at varying times at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. She has also served as the deputy director of the Center for Social Media for American University's School of Communications, and has occupied a number of other posts. Besides her academic appointments, McAfee has also founded and directed the Council for Public Media in Austin, Texas, from 1991 to 1995, on the board of the National Writers United Service Organization from 1995 to 1997, as a board member of Public Deliberation '96, as an advisor for various research projects and in various other politically minded roles since. She began to serve as a consultant to the Kettering Foundation in 1988, and continues to do so. She is a member of the editorial advisory board for Public Philosophy Journal. Research areas McAfee's research primarily focuses on questions of democracy and democratic practice, the same questions that had her enter academic philosophy in the first place. Her most recent research draws on prior work in psychoanalytic theory, democratic media, performative ethics, transitional justice, and feminist political theory to examine the role of informal political institutions in the formation of a democratic public. McAfee has done significant work on the writings of Julia Kristeva and J√ºrgen Habermas, and also delved extensively into feminist theory and the works of Hannah Arendt. Publications McAfee has authored three books; the first, Habermas, Kristeva, and Citizenship was published by Cornell University Press in 2000; the second Julia Kristeva was published in 2003 by Routledge, and the third Democracy and the Political Unconscious was published in 2008 by Columbia University Press. A fourth book, tentatively titled Democracy Otherwise is in progress. McAfee has also served as editor for a number of books and journal issues, and has also published a large number of peer- reviewed papers and several encyclopedia articles. Habermas, Kristeva, and Citizenship attempts to join the discourses of modernity and postmodernity in political theory and bring them to bear on the problem of deliberative democracy. McAfee's view is strongly informed by feminist theory, and she believes that political life is rooted in participation in political and that political agency is not a trait of rational individuals, but rather something enacted collectively through interactions with others in civil society. McAfee's Democracy and the Political Unconscious examines some of the pathologies that have been created in the United States in the wake of the Collapse of the World Trade Center. She believes that the way that the event was handled has resulted in the United States continually reliving the trauma of that day, and believes that the War on Terror is one significant cause of this cycle of unending trauma. She points towards South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a model of how the United States could move past that trauma.

Club career An Ipswich junior, O'Doherty was in the first-grade squad with the Ipswich Jets as early as 1986, playing under coach Tommy Raudonikis alongside players like Allan Langer and Kevin Walters. After moving to Sydney to play in the New South Wales Rugby League, O'Doherty made his first-grade debut with the Western Suburbs Magpies in 1989. He played in the club‚Äôs first four games of the year, all losses. He returned to first-grade in round 12 and remained in the starting team for the rest of the season. At one time, he undertook the team‚Äôs goal-kicking duties, making 11 conversions from 15 attempts. O'Doherty was sent from the field in a game against Penrith in 1990 following an on- field brawl. O'Doherty pleaded his innocence, saying, \\"I didn't throw a punch, I didn't throw anything. I said to Chris Mortimer, 'Let's keep out of this because it's the last game.‚Äô The next thing I know I'm an instigator and off the field.\\" In 1990, O'Doherty played in a career-best 20 games, scoring his sole career try in the round 16 match against the Brisbane Broncos. Moments after scoring, his try was overshadowed by O‚ÄôDoherty performing what is highly regarded by fans as one of the greatest dives in rugby league history when Bronco Gene Miles merely brushed past him in the in-goal and O‚ÄôDoherty dramatically flopped to the ground like he'd been shot by an exocet missile. However, with the arrival of new coach Warren Ryan and an influx of new players to Wests in 1991, O'Doherty signed a contract with the Gold Coast Seagulls. He stayed one season with them, playing in seven games as the club finished last on the table, claiming the wooden spoon. He was named as a member of the preliminary train-on squad for the Queensland State of Origin side that year, but was not called upon to play any part in the series itself. O'Doherty spent one more season in first-grade, playing six games with the Parramatta Eels in 1992, mostly from the bench. In 1993, he was playing in a competition in Perth. In 2004, he was captain-coaching Lower Clarence in the Group 1 competition.

It was designed by George Johnson and completed in 1874. It has been listed on the Victorian Heritage Register since 1973.Victorian Heritage Register: \\"Former Metropolitan Meat Market\\", retrieved 8 February 2014 The venue has undergone many iterations and currently serves as an arts venue under the City of Melbourne. Annually, the venue hosts a cultural and social events ranging from theatre, circus, dance to food and wine fairs, music launches and private functions, in addition to festivals including Melbourne Fringe Festival, Melbourne Knowledge Week, and Yirramboi First Nations Festival. History William John Clarke laid the foundation stone for the Metropolitan Meat Market in February 1880 Built in 1880, the Meat Market was originally conceived as a large-scale metropolitan trade space for meat vendors. The market ceased trade in 1974. The building remained unused until 1977, when the property was acquired by the state government and transformed into an arts centre, inaugurated in 1979.Michelle Sheedy: \\"Metropolitan Meat Market\\", in eMelbourne, July 2008 The space functioned as an office and workshop with arts and craft organisations and artists.

Johnson in 1879. An emigrant from Edmonton, London, Johnson was chosen to design the new market because of his experience in designing the former Victoria Meat Market. He was also the architect of Hotham Town Hall (known now as Melbourne Town Hall) and Civic Buildings, where William Reynolds, said to be the moving spirit behind the building of Meat Market, officiated as Mayor in 1878. Johnson later went on to design a score of other buildings in the area, and designed modifications on Meat Market's layout before dying en route to Melbourne from died of blood poisoning in 1898. With six shareholders of the former Victoria Meat Market and two others, influential trader William Reynolds formed the Metropolitan Meat Market Company with a view to building on land on the corner of Courtney and Blackwood Streets. Ornamentations in the venue include Reynolds as the bewhiskered figure whose modeled head appears over the Courtney Street inside entrance doors, and the 1874 in the pediment above the Blackwood Street entrance is the foundation date of the Victoria Meat Market Company. The building complex which Johnson designed for the Metropolitan Meat Market Company was an ambitious one, which it was proposed to complete in stages. The initial contract work, completed between September 1879 and December 1880, was to include the market hall itself for a length of thirteen bays from Courtney Street, with two additional bays projecting to the north; the offices fronting Courtney Street; and the hotel fronting both Blackwood and Courtney Streets but extending along Blackwood Street only so far north as it does at present, not up to the entrance gate. It was decided during the course of the contract to proceed with the bank (now the Blackwood Street Gallery) and manager's quarters, on the north side of the Blackwood Street gate, and it is probable that the gate itself and the fa√ßade linking up to the hotel were also undertaken. It was decided by 1880 to put in hand the first of the shops, being that on the South side of the Blackwood Street gate and it appears that instead of providing a house attached to the shop, as originally intended, quarters for the market caretaker were incorporated. The entrance way between the Blackwood Street gate and the market hall proper was at this stage left unroofed. This work did not embrace the buildings fronting Blackwood Street to the north of the present courtyard all of which are of later date. The 56 feet (17 metres) to the north of the bank were in 1889 leased to one Dunkerley for construction of a cooling chamber on what was actually described at the time as vacant ground. It appears that the construction of this was not proceeding satisfactorily and the Company intervened to carry out the work. G.R. Johnson was again commissioned and the new structure was given a fa√ßade harmonising with the existing building, though only one storey in height, and linked to them by a screen wall across in the front of a courtyard, now repurposed to the North Melbourne entrance.  Extensions and early use  An example of George Johnson's ornamentation inside Meat Market. Connection of the buildings to the sewerage system in 1990 required substantial works and called for the employment of an architect, but Johnson was now dead. The firm now commissioned was that of Gibbs and Finlay, originally established by Harry Browse Gibbs in 1882, and ultimately to become Gibbs, Finlay and Morsby. This firm, and Gibbs in particular, was to be responsible for major extensions to the market in 1906‚Äì1908, when the main hall was continued north to Tyrone Street, increasing the number of stalls, but very precisely matching the original design. In Blackwood Street, next to the existing cooling chamber, a new chamber was built, and then a new entrance at the north end of the site, surmounted by a characteristically Edwardian elliptical rusticated arch. The last major alterations to the buildings were made by Gibbs in the period 1918‚Äì1922, when it appears that the bank residence was modified to provide caretaker's quarters, an upper floor was built over Dunkerley's original freezing chamber to provide offices for the Master Butcher's Association, brick cooling chambers were built right along the western side of the market hall, and presumably at this time, a new range of cooling chambers inserted on the east side of the hall behind the Blackwood Street buildIngs. Meat Market was not a unique institution. Not only did the official City Meat Market compare with it, but its predecessor, the Victorian Meat Market Company, continued in operation and there were occasional reports of other establishments such as the 'Victoria Meat Market', in Lygon Street, Carlton. It would appear that it was intended in 1879 to float the enterprise as a public company but whether because of lack of response or for other reasons, it remained private. Only after 1919, as a result of criticism in a report on meat trade practices, did the company go public for a few years. It was undoubtedly the most ambitious private market complex ever established in Melbourne and appears for many years to have been the only privately operated wholesale market of any substance. The Metropolitan Meat Market Company continued to operate the market until June 1974, a total of ninety four years. The Managing Director of the Company in its final years was J.M. (Malcolm) Howlett, who was the son of James M. Howlett, who with his brother John T. Howlett commenced work with William Reynolds in the 1880s. Malcolm Howlett has remained keenly interested in the market since it became a Craft Centre and has in his writings about it, given us a clear picture of what it was like.  Auction and use as a craft centre  Meat Market's Flat Floor Pavilion is one of the venue's major event spaces. The property was put up for auction on Tuesday 18 December 1973, at a boom time for real estate prices. It was known to be of interest to developers as a large area of land in close proximity to the city and a sale price of around one and a quarter million dollars was considered likely. The buildings were already classified by the National Trust as of historical importance and worthy of preservation and the Historical Buildings Preservation Council now became involved, registering the Market seventeen days prior to the auction. Since this meant that it could not be demolished, the highest likely bidders were no longer interested and the property was passed in at auction for nine hundred and twenty five thousand dollars. The market remained unsold for nearly three years. During this time it was leased for a number of purposes, a disposals warehouse, auction room, trash and treasure market and car park. A number of groups and individuals looked at it with various commercial operations in mind, but none appeared to be economically viable. Early in 1975 glass artist David Wright went to Marjorie Johnson who was Executive Officer of the Craft Association of Victoria, then operating from first floor rooms in North Melbourne, and suggested to her that the old meat market, also in North Melbourne, would make a great craft centre. The timing was perfect. The Craft Association was finding it very difficult in a building without a lift to transport all the equipment they used for their craft promotional events in public places, such as the Fitzroy Gardens. Marjorie was at the time lobbying the Victorian Ministry for the Arts for more suitable premises for the Craft Association. A group comprising David Wright, Marjorie Johnson, Ian Sprague, Sue Walker, Colin Burroughs and John Mitchell thoroughly inspected the property and reported back to the Craft Association Executive that the market would indeed be as suitable as any building ever likely to come up for recycling. The Craft Association authorised Marjorie to put a submission to Dr. Eric Westbrook, then Director of the Victorian Ministry for the Arts, for the purchase of the market as the centre of the crafts in Victoria. Early talks with the Ministry suggested little possibility of success and there was also fear that a case before the Historical Buildings Preservation Council by the Metropolitan Meat Market Company for deregistration might be successful and the market would be lost. Very fortunately, the hearing of this case and the counter claim by the Victorian Ministry for the Arts through its officer Essie Wicks, found in favour of keeping the market on the H.B.P.C. register. When continuing representation for purchase to the Ministry throughout 1975 and into 1976 appeared to be making no progress, invitations were issued to a broadly representative group to meet to plan a campaign of action. This group first met on 26 May 1976. Some of its most committed members, David Wright, Wally Curran, Marjorie Johnson, Gordon Jackson, Ian Sprague and Nola Hjorth, met again, under the Chairmanship of David Wright, to consider possible courses of action open to it. However shortly thereafter the then Premier, Minister of the Arts and Treasurer, The Hon. Rupert Hamer, agreed that the Ministry for the Arts would fund an architectural feasibility study on the proposal to convert the market into a Craft Centre for Victoria. Architects engaged to undertake the study were Genser Shepherd and Associates of Punt Road, Richmond, with whom Marjorie Johnson worked over the next few months in the development of the feasibility study. The historical architectural data in this brief history is all taken from the Genser Shepherd study.  Government purchase  Soon after the receipt of the completed study, The Hon. Rupert Hamer, agreed that his Government would purchase Meat Market. In January 1977 the purchase was finalised at a cost of $890,000 and Meat Market on its various titles became Crown allotment No.21 section 11 at North Melbourne. Throughout 1977 and most of 1978, an interim committee and later a planning committee established by the Victorian Ministry for the Arts, met monthly to monitor basic building repairs, review tenancies, invite public response, investigate funding, examine alternative management structures, develop a philosophy for the Centre, assess applications for space and make recommendations to the Ministry for the Arts in relation to all of these matters. These final recommendations were submitted in September 1978 and in May 1979. The Hon. R.J. Hamer appointed Marjorie Johnson, who had just completed a two-year term as Festival Manager of Arts Victoria: Crafts, as Interim Manager with a brief to get Meat Market open as a Craft Centre. Approval had been given the previous year for three events of the Festival: \\"Australian Crafts '78\\", and a Glass Exhibition and Workshop, to be held in the market. For six months the Interim Manager and the resident caretaker were the only two occupants of the buildings with the former engaged in planning to open some time after the State Budget was brought down in September, providing that budget allowed for an allocation to the proposed Craft Centre. Following a one-off event, a Trade Fair organised by the Victorian Ceramic Group, held on 22‚Äì23 September 1979, the Craft Centre finally opened on a permanent basis on 8 November 1979. The Victorian State Craft Collection was on display in the front of the market hall and an exhibition of work by Melbourne State College Crafts students was at the rear. At this time also the first Board of Management was approved by the Minister for the Arts, then The Hon. Norman Lacy, and appointed under the Crown Land (Reserves) Act 1978 as a Committee of Management charged with the responsibility of administering the Crown Reserve as a Craft Centre. In March the following year (1980) this Committee became the Board of Directors of a Company Limited by Guarantee. Also that year, the position of General Manager was advertised and Marjorie Johnson applied for it and was appointed. The first task of The Board of Directors, under the Chairmanship of Judge John Campton was to develop a policy and objectives for the Centre and a range of activities which would give effect to those objectives. Their policy statement, published in September 1980, called for access workshops for all craft disciplines, individual workshops for rental to craftspeople, premises for craft groups, a crafts shop, changing exhibitions, an access gallery, a conference centre and the Victorian State Craft Collection display. The state of the building and the level of the annual grant in those early years allowed for only an exhibitions program, display of the State Collection and operation of the Blackwood Street Gallery. In 1981, The Hon. Rupert Hamer, who was now Minister for Tourism, approved a direct grant to the Centre to enable the setting up of the crafts shop with the important objective of providing high quality Australian Crafts to the tourist market. In 1982 with specified funding from the Victorian Ministry for the Arts, and the Crafts Board of the Australia Council, the Ceramic and Textile Access Workshops were established. This was now as far as development could go until funding was available to convert large sections of the building, whose condition rendered them unfit for anything at all. The announcement by The Hon. Race Mathews, Minister for the Arts, in November 1983 of $1,320,000 for the first phase building works followed by second and third phase works totaling $2,500,000 allowed for the complete restoration and conversion of the former Meat Market, so that all the projected activities of the 1980 plan could be realised.  Current Use  Meat Market in 2015 In 1998, Meat Market began being used as a creative and performing arts space. Followed by significant renovations in 2005, a dedicated management team was appointed in 2015. Now, over 50 businesses and individuals operate from the site. Meat Market has five spaces available for hire to the arts and the public, including the Flat Floor Pavilion, Cobblestone Pavilion, Meeting Room, Old Cafe and Stables. Meat Market is also one of few venues for hire in Melbourne featuring a circus truss, accommodating aerial and circus performances in the Cobblestone Pavilion. Meat Market also houses over 50 practitioners as 'licensees' - creative tenants which have a presence within the building. Licensees include a variety of creative outlets, including administrative offices for other arts organisations encompassing music and dance. Current and notable licensees include indigenous arts Ilbijerri Theatre Company, Melbourne Jazz Festival and Next Wave Festival.

Icke, a half back, started his career at Ballarat East, in the Ballarat Football League. In 1952 he was granted a permit to play for North Melbourne, after the VFL Permit Committee rejected a claim by Fitzroy that the defender had lived in Preston for 13 weeks, which would have tied him to the club, but Icke said it had only been six weeks.The Age, \\"Permit for Icke to Join North\\", 17 April 1952, p. 8 He missed just one game in 1952 and played 15 of the first 16 rounds of the 1953 season, before suffering a thigh injury. In 1954 he made 13 appearances, including North Melbourne's semi-final loss to Melbourne, which he played as a full-back. During the semi-final he was reporting for striking Ron Barassi and was suspended for the opening four rounds of the 1955 season. Icke was welcomed back into the North Melbourne team in round six, but following their round 11 loss to a weak St Kilda side by seven points, was dismissed from the club, along with Mick Grambeau. The pair were notified of the committee's decision by mail, with no reason given. The two players received support from their teammates, who held a club meeting on the Sunday where they unanimously agreed that the action of the committee was unconstitutional. Some of them had earlier considered pulling out of their game against Carlton that weekend, in protest. More than 2000 club supporters held a demonstration after the Carlton game, backing Icke and Grambeau. On the next Tuesday, the two players appeared before the North Melbourne committee and were reinstated on the club's training list, after signing a statement which said that the \\"committee of the North Melbourne Football Club acted correctly in dispensing of our services\\" and expressed a desire to \\"withdraw and apologise for statements made by us to the press\\". The reason for Icke and Grambeau being sacked was not revealed to the public, but was believed to be because the committee felt that they had not tried hard enough in the St Kilda game. Icke went straight back into the North Melbourne team, which played Collingwood in round 13. He played out the 1955 season, then in 1956 was cleared to Wimmera Football League club Minyip, as playing coach. Under Icke, Minyip made the 1956 Grand Final, which they lost to Ararat by 13 points. His son, Steven Icke, was a member of North Melbourne's 1977 premiership team. He also played for Melbourne.

He received national media attention during the 2013 football season for his calls of the game-winning plays against the Georgia Bulldogs and the Alabama Crimson Tide. Bramblett and his wife Paula were both killed in a car accident in Auburn, Alabama, on May 25, 2019.  Career  A 1988 graduate of Auburn University, Bramblett was the lead announcer for Auburn baseball for 11 seasons before he was chosen to succeed the late Jim Fyffe as lead announcer for Auburn football and men's basketball on June 23, 2003. Fyffe had died of a brain aneurysm on May 15, 2003. Jim Fyffe was known for his enthusiastic \\"Touchdown Auburn\\" call and Bramblett initially chose to honor that legacy by using \\"Touchdown Auburn\\" in a similar style at least once during football games. He would opt for \\"Touchdown Tigers\\" or other phrasing during other times. But in a 2013 interview with AuburnTigers.com writer Charles Goldberg, Bramblett reflected on how he transitioned into using \\"Touchdown Auburn\\" exclusively: Former Auburn quarterback Stan White served as Bramblett's color commentator throughout his tenure. White has been the network's color commentator since the 2001 football season. Bramblett also served as the Auburn Network's Director of Broadcast Services, the host of the network's call-in show, Tiger Talk, and the host of the weekly Auburn Football Review TV show.  Awards  Bramblett was named Alabama Sportscaster of the Year three times (2006, 2010, and 2013). Bramblett was honored as Sports Illustrated's Play-by-Play Announcer of the Year in 2013, primarily based on his calls of the winning plays in Auburn's final, regular season games against Georgia and Alabama.  Memorable Calls = 2003: Alabama at Auburn  Prior to the 2013 season, this call was, perhaps, Rod Bramblett's signature call. The 2003 season had been disappointing for Auburn and the game was played under speculation that head coach Tommy Tuberville would be fired regardless of the outcome. Running back Carnell \\"Cadillac\\" Williams had said in previous interviews that he \\"was crazy\\" when he was in the zone, and Auburn players had said they \\"go crazy\\" when Carnell does. Williams had left his first game against the Crimson Tide in 2001 after suffering a shoulder injury during the first series, and suffered a season-ending leg injury against Florida in 2002. His return to action against the Crimson Tide was highly anticipated. On the first play from scrimmage, Williams took the handoff from quarterback Jason Campbell. In the Auburn radio booth, Rod Bramblett made the call: The Tigers defeated the Crimson Tide 28-23.  2013: Georgia at Auburn  Auburn was in the midst of an improbable turnaround under first-year head coach Gus Malzahn after going 3-9 in 2012 (0-8 in SEC play). The Tigers entered their game against the No. 25 Georgia Bulldogs with a 9-1 record and a No. 7 ranking in the AP poll. The Tigers dominated the first half, leading 27-10 at halftime, and 37-17 with 12:39 to play in the fourth quarter. But Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray led a fourth quarter comeback and the Bulldogs took a 38-37 lead when Murray scored on a 5-yard run with 1:49 to play. The Tigers started their ensuing possession on their own 22. After managing one first down, Georgia's Jordan Jenkins sacked quarterback Nick Marshall, setting up a 4th-and-18 play for the Tigers, from their own 27 yard line. Rod Bramblett made the following call: Ricardo Louis's catch gave the Tigers a 43-38 advantage (a two-point conversion failed), but Georgia would get one final possession as Aaron Murray led the Bulldogs into Auburn territory. But a Dee Ford sack on fourth down sealed the victory for the Tigers. The Ricardo Louis touchdown was named the play of the game by CBS Sports and Rod Bramblett's call was used for the video replay. It was later heard on ESPN on both SportsCenter and College Football Final. During the week of the Iron Bowl, ESPN's Tom Rinaldi interviewed Rod Bramblett and others for a feature, titled \\"Prayer at Jordan-Hare\\", to be used for ESPN College GameDay, which would be in Auburn for the Iron Bowl. Bramblett called it \\"the most incredible, phenomenal, improbable, maybe impossible moment that I've ever witnessed and had the opportunity to call.\\"  2013: Alabama at Auburn  Two weeks after the miracle win against Georgia, the Tigers faced in-state rival and No. 1 ranked Alabama. ESPN's College GameDay was in town, and the two teams, for the first time since the inception of division play in 1992, would be playing to represent the SEC West in the SEC Championship Game. The Tigers took an early 7-0 lead on a Nick Marshall touchdown run, but the Crimson Tide pulled out to a 21-7 lead early in the second quarter. The Tigers closed the gap with a Tre Mason touchdown run and were down 21-14 at the half. The Tigers tied the game in the third quarter with a Nick Marshall touchdown pass to C. J. Uzomah. But after pinning the Crimson Tide on their own 1-yard- line, Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron completed a 99-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper to give the Crimson tide a 28-21 lead. The two teams traded defensive stops late in the fourth quarter and Auburn had the ball with 2:32 to play at their own 35. The Tigers ran the ball six consecutive plays and had 1st-and-10 at the Alabama 39 with 0:44 to play. Marshall kept the ball running left, then found receiver Sammie Coates wide open for the game-tying touchdown. Alabama's ensuing possession started at their 29. After an incomplete pass, T. J. Yeldon ran twice for 9 yards and 26 yards to the Auburn 38. Yeldon appeared to have been pushed out-of-bounds as time expired. But after an official review, it was determined that 0:01 remained in regulation and Alabama sent freshman kicker Adam Griffith in to attempt a 56-yard field goal. After a time-out, Auburn sent defensive back and kick return Chris Davis into the end zone in anticipation of a short kick. Rod Bramblett and Stan White made the call on the Auburn IMG Sports Network: Chris Davis's return was the CBS play of the game which, once again, allowed the TV audience to hear Bramblett's call. It was also played numerous times on various ESPN programming. Bramblett's call was also featured on ABC News on the Sunday following the game. On the Monday following the game, Bramblett was interviewed on Fox & Friends and the Tim Brando Show. Richard Sandomir of the New York Times wrote, \\"Auburn Announcer Has the Call of a Lifetime, Twice in One Month\\" in a feature story on Bramblett. Bramblett's Iron Bowl call has itself become part of Auburn folklore.Birmingham first-grader transcribes Rod Bramblett‚Äôs Iron Bowl radio call for assignment: The War Eagle Reader Just days after the game, a video of a 25-year-old woman from North Carolina with no previous connection to Auburn lip synching to Bramblett's call went viral on YouTube.The Rod Bramblett Iron Bowl Call lip sync champion is a 25-year-old from North Carolina who wasn't even an Auburn fan but now she is: The War Eagle Reader Other similar videos, mostly of young Auburn fans syncing the call, followed.Brambletting: Auburn fan kids are lip-synching Rod Bramblett's Iron Bowl radio call and it's wonderful A week later, the Tigers defeated Missouri 59-42 in the SEC Championship Game. The win, and Michigan State's win over Ohio State, sent the Tigers to the BCS National Championship Game vs. Florida State.

Her Olympic appearance is widely controversial, after it was exposed that di Silvestri, and her husband Gary di Silvestri, paid to become Dominica citizens and lied to media outlets about various aspects of their lives. Early life and business career Di Silvestri has been accused of being a \\"tax dodger\\" by Deadspin, after it was revealed that prosecutors in Turks and Caicos Islands have linked the pair to a massive tax-fraud case related to the sale of Emerald Cay, a mansion di Silvestri and Morrone built on their own island. Disputed background The website Deadspin published an additional investigative article that disputed multiple aspects of di Silvestri's background. The couple told various media outlets they were awarded citizenship through \\"philanthropic activities\\", but declined to elaborate. It was later revealed that any married couple can become Dominicans by depositing $175,000 \\"into the appropriate account at the National Commercial Bank of Dominica,\\" and paying the Ministry of Finance another $3,530 in tariffs and fees. When confronted by various media outlets about their questionable claims, di Silvestri did not respond to inquiries or declined comment. Questionable qualification U-T San Diego also published an article questioning the couple's qualification process for the games. Skiers earn the points by competing in qualifying races, which the couple gained by entering lower level tournaments in New Zealand and across North America. Gary finished last in four of six races and Angelica finished in the bottom three in 13 of the 14 races she participated in. Gary still met the standard, but Angelica was in danger of missing out until she went to a small competition for college students in Maine. The report states she only finished in 74th place out of 95 finishers in the freestyle race, but that was still enough to get her point total under the Olympic threshold. Athletic career Gary di Silvestri competed along with his wife, Angelica, during the 2014 Games. However, neither was able to complete their respective races.Dominica News Online Gary was one of four competitors to not finish his 15 km event (there was also one non-starter). Of the four skiers who did not finish, Gary was the only one to not manage to make it to the first checkpoint (at 2.2 km). Angelica didn't even show up for the 10K women's classic on Feb. 13, claiming injury. (She was the only one of the race's 76 entrants who didn't start).

It opened on August 28, 1992. The hotel has 632 rooms and suites, four international restaurants, two lounges, a cafe, and a bakeshop, across two wings, and is considered a city resort. The hotel is designed in a beach resort-style within the downtown area of the city and is located on the Shang Palace estate, which covers 8.6 hectares, and includes the hotel, Shangri-La Plaza, the residential St. Francis Shangri-La Place and a new Shangri-La Plaza East Wing opened in 2013. The hotel is considered one of the landmark buildings in Manila due to it being the first of its kind in the city, and its clientele consists 85 per cent of locals rather than foreign tourists.  History  Edsa Shangri-La, Manila, opened on August 28, 1992, the first Shangri-La property in The Philippines. Originally known as Shangri-La‚Äôs Edsa Plaza Hotel, it was designed to recreate a five-star resort, such as those in Cebu and Boracay, but within the downtown Manila district of Ortigas Center. The hotel is 99.99% foreign owned. In 2003 extensive renovations were completed, including the refurbishment of 440 rooms in the Tower Wing, and redesigns by Warner Wong Design and Architecture of Singapore for the Summer Palace and Nishiki restaurants. In 2006 a US$3 million investment was announced to launch a spa facility, a then unique concept for Manila to have a Cebu-style spa within the city itself. It was modeled on the Shangri-La Mactan Island Resort & Spa, Cebu. The following year further renovations at a cost of US$8 million, creating 76 new jobs, saw improvement works on the Garden Wing and the Horizon Club Lounge. In 2009 Shang Properties Inc. began construction of One Shangri- La Place, a twin-tower condominium that is part of an integrated community including Edsa Shangri-La Hotel and Shangri-La Plaza. The 60-storey structure includes 580 units and is expected to earn P10 billion, with completion of residential units due in 2014. In 2013 the Shangri-La Plaza, part of the Shang Place estate, was extended with the opening of the Shangri-La Plaza East Wing, the retail section of the forthcoming One Shangri-La Place residential tower to be completed in 2014. Current General Manager Patrick Schaub, who previously worked on properties in Thailand, the USA, and Switzerland, took over from Henry Lee in April 2013.  Design and construction  The resort was designed by Kanko Kikaku Sekkeisha of Tokyo and R. Villarosa Architects, and features two white towers set in a tropical garden amongst the mostly residential Ortigas Center. The floors of the hotel are marble, while the interior includes Asian paintings and floral arrangements. The Tower Wing is coloured brown and red with cityscape views, while the Garden Wing has views over the landscaped gardens. Interior design was developed by Hirsch Bedner Associates Design Consultants of Hong Kong during the 2006/7 renovations of the Garden Wing. Warner Wong Associates of Singapore renovated the rooms of the Tower Wing in 2003/4, while Leese Robertson Freeman of Hong Kong are currently renovating the same rooms for 2012/3. The hotel focuses on using local supplies and craftsmanship, such as the woodwork in the Summer Palace, designed by renowned Filipino artist-sculptor Claude Tayag.  Features  The hotel includes Horizon Club floors located on the 11th to the 14th floors, an outdoor pool, a 24-hour gym, spa, outdoor tennis courts, function and banquet halls that can accommodate up to 1,200 people, and a number of restaurants and bars. Rooms and suites The hotel has 632 rooms and come in 9 types, including 4 Deluxe Suites, 19 Premier Suites, 2 Shangri-La Suites and 1 Edsa Suite.  Restaurants  Edsa Shangri-La serves up to one million diners a year at its food and beverage outlets, to both room guests and locals, The hotel also hosts The Bakeshop, The Lobby Lounge, and, formerly, e‚Äôs Bar which is now an event space. * HEAT - International Located on the Lobby Level and with 426 seats, HEAT was unveiled after a five-month renovation by Hirsch- Bedner in January 2006. It replaced the previous Garden Cafe. * Summer Palace - Chinese The hotel‚Äôs Cantonese restaurant seats 250 . * Senju - Japanese It was opened in 2006, replacing former Japanese restaurant Nishiki. * Paparazzi - Italian Paparazzi was refurbished in 2004.  CHI, The Spa  CHI, The Spa at Shangri-La, covering 3,000 square meters and featuring 10 treatment suites, was announced in 2006 with a US$3 million investment. It was opened in July 2007 by then President of the Philippines Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.  Events  The hotel is frequently used for national and international events, such as The National Book Awards and exclusive fashion shows by designers such as Francis Libiran. It is also used as an informal gathering point for leading journalists, business executives, corporate communications professionals etc., for get-togethers like the Tuesday Club, in which the members have invited special guests to share ideas over breakfast for 20 years.

Background A Filipino delegate at the 2005 international conference of ECPAT called for an investigation into the proliferation of Kopinos. According to the delegate, when the Korean fathers return to Korea, most of them stop contacting their children in the Philippines and no longer provide any form of support. The responsibility then falls on the Filipina mother who unfortunately has to raise the child herself. The Philippines is a strong Catholic Nation that gives importance to life. Abortion is Criminal and Contraceptives is not widely discussed. The Kopinos are left to grow up and be supported by their Mothers . This problem occurs by a wrong sex-culture of Korean men. Korean men go to the Philippines for language training or sex tourism without taking responsibilities. As their fathers are not married to their mothers, the children are unable to obtain South Korean citizenship. As recently as 2003 they were believed to number fewer than 1,000; another 9,000 were born from 2003 to 2008. As a result, Filipinos' perception of Korean men has taken a turn for the worse. In response, South Korean NGOs such as the Daejeon Migrant Workers Support Center, as well as locally established NGOs like the Kopino Children Center, have begun to establish branch offices in the Philippines to provide social services to the children and their mothers. There are also Filipino Amerasian, Japino and Chinoy/Tsinoy in the Philippines. Comparison to Lai Dai Han A 2016 article in The Sungkyun Times said that Kopinos are referred to as the \\"New Lai Daihan\\", and a 2013 article in The Granite Tower said that Kopinos are considered to be the \\"second version of Lai Dai Hans\\". Kopino population A 2008 article in The Korea Times said that there may have been 10,000 Kopinos in 2008, and the 2008 news article said that it was estimated that there were 1,000 Kopinos in 2003.Ha, Michael.

Profile of the parents of Kopinos=Profile of the Korean fathers A 2016 article in The Sungkyun Times said that \\"the most important\\" factor that was causing more Kopinos to be fathered by Korean men was that the Korean men were deceiving the Filipino women about their intentions to have a future together with the Filipino women. The 2016 article said that 90% of the Korean fathers of Kopinos were students who were in their twenties. South Korean television network MBC made a video where they interviewed Filipino hostesses at a hostess bar which was located somewhere on the island of Cebu in the Philippines. In the English- language dub by Link TV of the original MBC video, the video's narrator explained that \\"Most of the Korean men who solicit prostitution don't want to use a condom, causing prostitutes to get pregnant with their babies\\". In the dubbed video, a Filipino bar hostess was asked the question \\"Are there many Korean babies?\\" by an interviewer to which she replied \\"Almost, Korean men don't use a condom\\". A 2016 article in The Korea Times said that ECPAT Korea classified the fathers of Kopinos into three broad categories. It said that there were young Korean men in school who went to the Philippines for the purpose of learning English, and it said that there were middle-aged Korean men who went to the Philippines for business reasons. Third, it said that there were Korean men who stayed in the Philippines for a short time for reasons of prostitution.Kim, Se-jeong. (2016). Kopino mom's fight to get son a life. The Korea Times. link Profile of the Filipino mothers In a 2016 article in The Sungkyun Times, 80% of Filipinos are Catholics, and Catholics are supposedly discouraged from using artificial contraceptives and abortion. This religious factor of Filipino women contributed to the increase of Kopinos. The article said that 90% of the Filipino mothers of Kopinos who had talked to the We Love Kopino organization were women who worked by teaching English or doing some other type of work that did not involve prostitution. The article said that this high percentage of non-prostitutes was contrary to the idea that the majority of the Filipino mothers of Kopinos were prostitutes. South Korean television network MBC made a video where they interviewed Filipino hostesses at a hostess bar which was located somewhere on the island of Cebu in the Philippines. In the English-language dub by Link TV of the original MBC video, the narrator referenced the hostess bar when he said that \\"Many of the women who work here are Kopino mothers working to support their babies after being abandoned by Korean men,\\" and the narrator said that \\"The majority of Kopinos are born from hostess bars.\\" Korean men soliciting prostitutes South Korean television network MBC did a video that talked about Korean men soliciting prostitutes in the Philippines. In the English-language dub by Link TV of the original MBC video, the narrator said, \\"With more and more Koreans visiting the Philippines to study or for vacation, the number of Koreans in the Philippines has increased four times in the last ten years. This has led tourism companies in to create prostitution tours, attracting Korean men.\\" The narrator then stopped talking, and a \\"tour guide\\" whose face was blurred out said, \\"We have a night tour in our travel course. It usually costs a hundred dollars for four people.\\" The narrator then resumed talking, and the narrator said, \\"Neon signs still shine brightly from the hostess bar for Koreans on Cebu street. About two-hundred and fifty Koreans have been arrested for soliciting prostitution in the Philippines during the last five years, more than any other group of foreigners.\\" The Philippine Government is on crack down for these illegal activities.

The website got its pictures from a civic group which received the pictures from Filipino mothers of abandoned Kopino children. The website creator said that some people were threatening to sue him for privacy invasion, but he doubted that they could sue him, because he felt that abandoning Kopino children was worse than what he was doing by exposing them for it.

Its markets include the utility, hybrid vehicle, ship building, industrial automation, semiconductor processing, and defense sectors. Satcon filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on October 17, 2012 and it announced to change to liquidate under Chapter 7 on February 7, 2013. As part of the settlement Perfect Galaxy and Great Wall purchased the company's assets including all Satcon Intellectual Property and Patents.  History  In 1985 SatCon Technology Corporation was founded by Dave Eisenhaure, formerly of MIT/Draper Laboratory, to develop, market, and sell products required by the world‚Äôs growing need for cleaner and lower-cost energy and power. In 1992 the company‚Äôs CEO Dave Eisenhaure and CFO Mike Turmelle took the company public on the Nasdaq exchange (NASDAQ:SATC). After the company became public, it acquired eight private companies and one public company. The two most notable of these acquisitions were the former Westinghouse Electric Vehicle Group, which was acquired from Northrup Grumman, and Inverpower, a public Canadian company. These acquisitions and the parent company were reorganized into a diverse organization with four plants in the U.S. and Canada. SatCon provided products and services to major international companies, including Chrysler, General Motors, Ford, Litton, Fuel Cell Energy, Applied Materials, as well as major divisions of the U.S. armed forces. SatCon also created Beacon Power as a separate public company to commercialize flywheel energy storage products. Products developed by SatCon have contributed to the advancement of the utility, hybrid vehicle, ship building, industrial automation, semiconductor processing, and defense markets. SatCon is particularly well known for its work in advanced electric drives; in the technology of inverters for smart grid and photovoltaic applications; and in the development of light-weight, high-power electronics, which contributed to the development of practical hybrid and electric vehicles. In 1995 SatCon and Chrysler were awarded the Discover Award for innovation in automotive engineering. This award was granted for the development of the drivetrain for Chrysler‚Äôs Patriot Race Car. The Patriot Race Car was built as a testbed for a turbine-electric flywheel hybrid drive train with a maximum output of 750 horsepower. SatCon was the prime contractor, designing and manufacturing the drive train and developing the needed technologies for its implementation. SatCon and Chrysler were nominated for and ultimately selected from numerous candidates for this award by a committee of automotive experts assembled by Discover Magazine. In 2003, SatCon introduced the first 100 KW PV inverter in a single cabinet, PowerGate, and in the next five years introduced the 225 KW, 500 KW, and 1 MW series Inverters that convert the direct current (DC) power into usable alternating (AC) power. In 2009 SatCon reorganized to focus exclusively on the PV market and between 2009-2011, SatCon introduced more product series, such as Prism, and Solstice. In 2012, the company introduced Equinox LC for the light commercial market. In 2013, Perfect Galaxy and Great Wall purchased the company's assets including all Satcon Intellectual Property and Patents.  Products  The company mainly has three production lines: Solstice, a power harvesting and array management solution for utility-class power plants; Prism Platform, an integrated 1 or 1.25MW solution for utility- scale solar PV installations; Equinox, a power conversion solution for grid- connected electrical power. Other products include Equinox LC; PowerGate Plus; PV View Plus and Satcon Smart Combiner, monitoring service via Internet; Energy Equity Protection and Other Legacy Power Products (such as static disconnect switches).

Anna and Jeremy meet at the Grill where Jeremy tries once again to convince Anna to turn him. She asks him to keep her secret from everyone and she sees his bracelet with the vervain that Elena gave him. Jeremy offers to give it to her since she likes it so much but she gives it back to him and asks him to keep wearing it. Pearl gets into the Grill to find and take Anna and Anna gets up to walk away from Jeremy sending him a text to explain that her mother walked in. On their way out they run into Mayor Lockwood (Robert Pralgo) and Tyler (Michael Trevino). Mayor asks them not to go out in the storm and invites them to join them for dinner but Pearl declines. She hears his name on her way out and changes her mind coming back. Meanwhile, Stefan is weakened by the fight with Frederick and Bethanne and goes out for hunting alone. Frederick and the other vampires find him, they stab him in the gut and take him to their house. Damon worries about Stefan not coming back home and not answering his phone and goes to Elena to ask if he is there. He suspects that Stefan has been taken by Pearl's vampires and his suspicions are confirmed when he visits the house and Frederick answers the door. They show him Stefan who is wounded but Damon can't enter the house to help him without invitation. Damon tells Elena that Stefan is in the house but he cannot get in. Elena wants to go herself but Damon stops her. He knows that they have to save Stefan but does not know how. They go to school to ask Alaric's (Matt Davis) help since he knows about vampires, has weapons and the ring that protects him. Alaric denies to help them but he accepts when Damon tells him that Pearl can lead him to Isobel. Meanwhile, the vampires keep torturing Stefan by stringing him up on vervain-laced ropes and stabbing him. Harper (Sterling Sulieman) shows up and tries to stop them since Pearl would not agree to this but the other vampires tie him up as well and stake him on the legs. Damon and Alaric make their plan while Elena insists to go into the house with them. Damon refuses and explains her why she cannot get into that house that is, in case she does not know, full of vampires. Elena can drive the car but she has to stay in it while the two of them try to help Stefan. Alaric knocks on Pearl's door and when Frederick answers he tells him that he needs to use his phone because his car broke down. Frederick lets him in and when Alaric is led to the kitchen, he stakes the vampire who'is there and leads Miss Gibbons (Tiffany Morgan) to the door but she refuses to invite Damon in since she is compelled not to do it. Damon asks if there are any other living people who live in this house and when he is sure that there are not, he breaks her neck and gets in. Back at the Grill, Pearl tries to get as many details as she can from the Mayor about his family at the dinner. Anna and Jeremy exchange texts from across the room but Pearl notices and asks the Mayor who is the boy. He tells her that his name is Jeremy Gilbert. Pearl follows Anna to the ladies' room and confronts her about Jeremy. She tells her the Gilbert family is the reason she was trapped in the tomb for over a century and asks her to stop seeing him because when he finds out what she is he will turn on her. Anna reveals that Jeremy already knows and Pearl slaps her. Anna walks out of the Grill texting Jeremy: \\"I'll do it\\". Damon keeps looking for Stefan killing some other vampires in the process. Alaric returns to the car but Elena is not there so he goes back to the house knowing that she went there to help Stefan. Elena sneaks into the basement getting herself in trouble before Damon appears to save her. They find Stefan and Harper and they free them. Damon goes to distract Frederick, who already got suspicious that something is going on, while Elena helps Stefan to get out. Damon fights with Frederick and two other vampires when Alaric shows up to help him. Frederick escapes and Damon searches the house to find him but he is not there. They try to get out to head to the car but a bunch of vampires appear and they return in. Pearl and Anna return home to find them inside. Damon explains what happened before he and Alaric walk out the door, leaving Pearl and Anna behind with all the vampire bodies. Stefan and Elena make it back to the car but the key is missing. Frederick shows up and starts hitting and stabbing Stefan. He is about to kill him when Elena stabs him in the back. Stefan tells Elena to run but she gives him her wrist to drink from so he can regain his strength. Stefan tries to resist but eventually he drinks and manages to kill Frederick. In the meantime, Caroline (Candice Accola) has to drive to a family engagement in the storm and she leaves after she says goodbye to Matt (Zach Roerig). The main roads are closed so she drives in the backwoods when her car gets stuck in the mud. She has no cell reception so she decides to get out trying to get one and call for help. She falls down and grabs a tree root to steady herself only to discover that it is a human arm. Matt and Kelly (Melinda Clarke) prepare their dinner when the doorbell rings and Caroline is at the door with her mom, Liz (Marguerite MacIntyre). They ask to see Kelly and they inform her, and Matt, that they found Vicky's body. Liz calls the Mayor to let him know. When he tells Tyler they have to go, he tells him about Vicky and Jeremy also hears. Tyler and Jeremy head to Matt's house and Jeremy also calls Elena to tell her. Elena and Jeremy return home where Jeremy finds Anna waiting on his room. Anna realizes that Jeremy only wanted to turn to find Vicky and she takes off before Jeremy apologizes. Damon sits next to Alaric at the bar for a drink and tries to have a friend-talk with him but Alaric punches him and leaves. Damon returns home and finds IV blood bags all over the place and Stefan drinking from one.

Reviews \\"Let the Right One In\\" received positive reviews. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.2/5. \\"While \\"Let the Right One In\\" didn't delve much into the show's mythology, it held nothing back when it came to blood, gore and violence. [...] From Stefan getting tortured like Jack Bauer, to multiple stake stabbings and blood sucking, this episode was filled with the sort of fare not typically scene on television at 8 p.m.\\" Josie Kafka from Doux Reviews rated the episode with 3/4. \\"Our heroes and our villains are choosing sides. Damon, Elena, and Alaric made an alliance to save Stefan, the tombies are replaying the civil war, and Jeremy is trying to bat for the other team. With only five episodes left until the finale, it seems like some serious battle lines are being drawn.\\" Robin Franson Pruter rated the episode with 3/4 saying that the episode presages a major development in the character of Stefan Salvatore. \\"This episode only hints at the full import of what occurs, but the events here begin a huge unpacking of the complexity of the character of Stefan. [...] No words are said in this final scene. Wesley and Somerhalder convey much with just an exchange of glances, Stefan‚Äôs guilty desperation, Damon‚Äôs apprehension, suggesting that, whatever this means, it doesn‚Äôt bode well.\\" and she closes her review: \\"This episode presents strong character development (Alaric excluded), examines the evolving and deepening of relationships between these characters, and offers an exciting storyline that evolves from those characters and relationships, even as that story deepens what we know about them.\\" Popsugar from Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode. \\"I'll admit that I wasn't sure how the Salvatore brothers could survive this week's The Vampire Diaries. When Stefan gets nabbed by Frederick and his fanged friends, you basically have the perfect setup for a bloodbath ‚Äî and the episode doesn't disappoint in that department.\\" Popsugar also commented on the Elena/Damon relationship saying: \\"Can you say sexual tension? Elena and Damon get into it while standing thisclose (in the rain, no less) as they argue about if Elena can go to save Stefan. They really have a nice mix of heat and genuine concern for each other. I guess time will only tell when/if these two get together.\\" Zeba of Two Cents TV also gave a good review to the episode saying that it was more thrilling than last week‚Äôs. \\"Things got a little crazy on last night‚Äôs episode of the Vampire Diaries, and if you guessed that most of the craziness came from Miss Pearl‚Äôs gang of misfit vampires, led by the sketchy Frederick ‚Äì then you are so right.\\" Tiffany Vogt of The TV Watchtower gave a good review to the episode. \\"Once the crypt was opened, we knew that a blood-bath was coming to Mystic Falls. We just did not foresee that it would be a vampire blood-bath. Who knew that the entombed vamps would be so blood-thirsty for revenge on their fellow vamps, Stefan and Damon?\\" References Category:2010 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 1) episodes ","title":"Let the Right One In (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"41879208","text":"Commissioners Flat is a locality of the Moreton Bay Region in Queensland, Australia.

The army was first formed in August 1941 and fought in the Leningrad Strategic Defensive Operation. The army suffered heavy losses and was disbanded in early September. Its remnants were moved to the 54th Army. Reformed in April 1942 on the Bryansk Front, the army fought in the Maloarkhangelsk Offensive in the winter of 1943. It was sent to the Central Front in March and defended the northern face of the Kursk Bulge. During the summer, it fought in Operation Kutuzov and the Chernigov-Pripyat Offensive. From November, the army fought in the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive. The army fought in Operation Bagration from June 1944. During the offensive, the army captured Zhlobin and Bobruisk and was on the Narew by early September. During early 1945, the army fought in the East Prussian Offensive and ended the war in East Prussia during May. The army was transferred to Poland in July 1945 and its headquarters was used to form the Kazan Military District in September. First Formation The army was established on 7 August 1941 from the Novgorod Operational Group, under command of Lt. Gen. Stepan Akimov, its initial order of battle was as follows: * * 70th Rifle Division * 128th Rifle Division * 237th Rifle Division * 1st Separate Mountain Rifle Brigade * 21st Tank Division The army was assigned to Northwestern Front and was responsible for the front's left flank north of Lake Ilmen. It also had under command the Ilmen Detachment of Ships.David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 ‚Äì 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, p 48 On 12 August the army, along with the 11th, 27th and 34th Armies, began a series of assaults against the German X Army Corps near Staraya Russa. These attacks failed to regain much territory but delayed the German advance on Leningrad by a further week.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p 12. Glantz states that 48th Army was part of Northern Front at this time. Following this, the 48th took up positions forward of Luga and Novgorod as part of the Luga defense line. That line was penetrated in the renewed German advance, and Luga fell on 20 August, with heavy Soviet casualties; the army was a wreck with only 6,235 men, 5,043 rifles and 31 guns remaining. It was transferred to the Northern Front and ordered to defend the Gruzino-Liuban sector southeast of Leningrad. On 23 August Northern Front was subdivided, and 48th Army became part of the new Leningrad Front.Glantz, Leningrad, pp 61‚Äì62 On 1 September the 48th comprised the 128th and 311th Rifle Divisions, the mountain brigade, the 541st Gun Artillery Regiment of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and the 21st Tank Division.Combat composition of the Soviet Army, 1 September 1941, available online at bdsa.ru At this time, it was commanded by Lieutenant General Maxim Antoniuk. Heavy attacks by the German XXXIX Motorized Corps forced the army to abandon Mga, a key railway link. Akimov was ordered to retake the town, which he did with the help of a fresh division of NKVD border guards, but the town was lost again the next day. During the first week of September the 20th Motorized Division, reinforced with elements of 12th Panzer Division, ground its way northwards against the resistance of the mountain brigade and the NKVD men before capturing Shlisselburg on Lake Ladoga on 8 September, isolating Leningrad, with the bulk of the army outside, to the east. On 12 September, the remnants of 48th Army were disbanded, being reassigned to the new 54th Army.Glantz, Leningrad, p 65-66, 75 Second Formation The army was formed for a second time from 28th Mechanized Corps (Second Formation) Headquarters on 20 April 1942, part of the Bryansk Front. It included the 1st Guards Rifle Division, a mortar regiment and a separate engineer battalion. The army was commanded by Major General Grigory Khalyuzin. On 1 June, the army included the 6th Guards, 8th, 211th and 280th Rifle Divisions. It also included the 118th and 122nd Rifle Brigades as well as the 80th and 202nd Tank Brigades. Artillery and engineer units were also included. Air support was provided by the 879th Light Bomber Aviation Regiment. Army troops took up positions on the Korobka River west of Novosil. From the end of June to July, the army fought in heavy defensive battles in the Yeletsky direction. During the battles, the army was able to hold the German troops at the line of Bolshoy Malinovets, Zalegosh, Setenyovo and Svetitsky. On 27 August the deputy commander of the army, Major General Konstantin Ignatievich Novik, was killed in action at Dishnia Station during a heavy enemy artillery raid.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, trans. and ed. by D.M. Glantz, Frank Cass (Publisher), London, 1998, pp 67‚Äì68 In February 1943, the army launched an offensive in the Maloarkhangelsk direction. On 12 February, Lieutenant General Prokofy Romanenko took command of the army. By 23 February it was in position southwest of Novosil and northwest of Maloarkhangelsk. 48th Army newspaper \\"Slavo Boitsa\\" correspondent Senior Lieutenant Zinovy Shkapenyuk recording Sovinformburo reports, 1944 On 13 March, the army was transferred to the Central Front. During the summer and fall of 1943, the army fought in battles on the northern face of the Kursk Bulge, Operation Kutuzov and the Chernigov- Pripyat Offensive. Continuing to advance towards Gomel along with the 61st and 65th Armies, the 48th Army cleared the left bank of the Sozh of German troops by 10 October. The army then pursued the German troops to the south of Gomel. On 20 October, it transferred to the Belorussian Front and from the first week of November fought in the expansion of the bridgehead on the right bank of the Sozh. From 19 November, it fought in the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive. During early 1944, the army carried out an attack towards Bobruisk. At the outset of Operation Bagration on 23 June 1944, the 48th Army had been substantially reinforced, and was comprised as follows:Combat composition of the Soviet Army, 1 July 1944 * 29th Rifle Corps (102nd, 217th Rifle Divisions) * 42nd Rifle Corps (137th, 170th, 399th Rifle Divisions) * 53rd Rifle Corps (17th, 73rd, 96th Rifle Divisions) * 197th Rifle Division * 115th Fortified RegionDunn, Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, p 182 * 22nd Artillery Division (13th and 59th Light Artillery Brigades, 63rd Howitzer Artillery Brigade) * 68th Light Artillery Brigade * 220th Guards Antitank Artillery Regiment * 479th Mortar Regiment * 31st Antiaircraft Artillery Division (1376th, 1380th, 1386th, 1392nd Antiaircraft Artillery Regiments) * 461st Antiaircraft Artillery Regiment * 42nd and 231st Separate Tank Regiments * 341st Guards Heavy Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment * 713th, 1890th and 1897th Self-Propelled Artillery Regiments * 39th Separate Armored Train Division * 57th Engineering-Sapper Brigade * 104th Pontoon Bridge Battalion * 142nd Separate Flamethrower Company The main mission of the army in the initial stages was to screen the three German divisions in the triangle formed by the Dniepr and Berezina rivers, while assisting the breakthrough of 3rd Army to the north with an assault by 42nd and 29th Rifle Corps against the German positions north of Rogachev; this would form the northern pincer seeking to encircle the German 9th Army. By the evening of 24 June the Soviet corps were 5 km west of that town, the 296th Infantry Division had been overwhelmed, and the breakthrough was being exploited by 9th Tank Corps into the German rear.Dunn, Soviet Blitzkrieg, pp 185‚Äì89 Advancing towards Bobruisk, the army captured Zhlobin on 26 June and along with the 65th Army destroyed German troops surrounded in the Bobruisk area. On 29 June, army troops captured Bobruisk. Continuing the attack towards Baranovichi and Brest, 28th, 65th and 48th Armies defeated German troops around Baranovichi during three days of fighting. At the end of July, the army was south of Surazh. During August and early September, the army advanced 150 kilometers and reached the Narew by 8 September in the area of Ruzhany and Pu≈Çtusk. The army went on the defensive and transferred to the 2nd Belorussian Front on 22 September 1944. On 15 December 1944, Lieutenant General Nikolai Gusev became the army's commander. During early 1945, the army fought in the East Prussian Offensive. On 11 February it was moved to the 3rd Belorussian Front. It advanced to the Frisches Haff on 25 March, where it went on the defensive. From 1 to 5 May, the army led attacks on the Baltic coast. In July 1945 it was moved from Germany to Poland, and in September 1945 its headquarters was used to form the Kazan Military District (:ru:–ö–∞–∑–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –æ–∫—Ä—É–≥).Michael Holm, Kazan Military District  Commanders  * Lieutenant General Stepan Akimov (04.08.1941 - 31.08.1941), * Lieutenant General Maksim Antoniuk (01.09.1941 - 12.09.1941), * Major General Grigory Khalyuzin (03.05.1942 - 11.02.1943), * Lieutenant General Prokofy Romanenko (12.02.1943 - 15.12.1944), * Lieutenant General Nikolai Gusev (15.12.1944 - 09.05.1945), From 05.05.1945 Colonel- General References Category:Field armies of the Soviet Union Category:Military units and formations established in 1941 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 ru:48-—è –∞—Ä–º–∏—è (–°–°–°–†) ","title":"48th Army (Soviet Union)"},{"id":"41879429","text":"Ada River may refer to the following watercourses: In Australia * Ada River (Baw Baw, Victoria), a watercourse in the Shire of Baw Baw of Victoria * Ada River (East Gippsland, Victoria), a tributary of the Bemm River in the Shire of East Gippsland of Victoria In Italy *Adda (river), or Ada, a tributary of the Po in North Italy In New Zealand * Ada River (New Zealand), a tributary of the Waiau River in the South Island See also Adda River (disambiguation) ","title":"Ada River"},{"id":"41879436","text":"\\"Leave It Alone\\" is a song written by James Mercer and Brian Burton of the American alternative rock band Broken Bells.

The song's hook, which had been described by vocalist James Mercer as having a sense of \\"shamefulness\\", were the first lyrics written for the song, serving as the inspirational basis for the rest of the song's lyrics. Mercer spoke to National Public Radio, stating: :\\"That hook came somewhere along the line. ... I remember when it did happen, though, that it felt like, okay, well, there's like a shamelessness to it, with the keyboard sound and the real, over-the-top melody. It was like, 'So what, man?' We grew up listening to things that were big, but they were sad, too. So, it was like, well, we can be big as long as it's as sad as [our music gets]. It's just there. So we didn't really dial it back too much.\\" Recording \\"Perfect World\\" was first written and recorded well into the recording sessions for After the Disco, borrowing elements from the title track, \\"After the Disco\\", a track which they had finished working on by the time \\"Perfect World\\" had been conceived. A chord progression for the song was the first written element of the song; instruments and vocals were recorded later on. Two versions of \\"Perfect World\\" were originally created by the band; one version presenting the song as a lighter, yet fast-paced melody and one presenting it as a heavier, slower melody. The final version of the track that appears as the opening track on After the Disco features elements of both of the original versions of the track, mixing it into a single track.
