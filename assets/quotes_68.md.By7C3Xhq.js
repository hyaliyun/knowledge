The book was published by Knopf, the firm that published almost all of Child's work from the beginning to the end of her career. The video series was produced with and marketed by the WGBH Educational Foundation in Boston but was shot at Child's home in Santa Barbara, California. The Way To Cook differs from Mastering the Art of French Cooking in numerous ways. While Mastering was a collaboration that co-authors Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle had gotten underway before Child's involvement, The Way To Cook was a solo work written entirely by Child during the late 1980s. Another difference was that The Way To Cook did not focus entirely on French cuisine, on which her reputation had been built, but added a substantial number of recipes for traditional American dishes, especially those of New England, where Child's mother had come from and where Child had spent much of her life. In this, the book reflected the diversification of the cooking repertoire on Child's television show, Julia Child & Company, that had taken place since its premiere in 1978. The book also formally described an approach to teaching that Child and others had been using since the very beginning, providing a more explicit focus on \\"master recipes\\"—that is, recipes that illustrate broad principles in cooking—with other recipes provided as variations on those same themes. The book also made greater use of improved cookware designs and of new technology such as the food processor, of which Child was a major proponent. The 1983 revision of Mastering was inspired in large part by the introduction of the food processor into the market. The book immediately proved to be extremely popular, with four printings in the first month after its introduction.Masthead of a copy from the fourth printing, dated November 1989 In December 2009, the videos, originally available only as a set of six videotapes, were re-released as a set of two DVDs.

Presentation Halo nevi are also known as Sutton's nevi, or leukoderma acquisitum centrifugum. Halo nevi are named such because they are a mole (nevus) that is surrounded by an area of depigmentation that resembles a halo. Halo nevi are associated with vitiligo. Sometimes the pale (hypopigmented) areas will spontaneously regress, and pigment returns. Causes The formation of a halo surrounding a nevi is believed to occur when certain white blood cells called CD8+ T lymphocytes destroy the pigment- producing cells of the skin (melanocytes). The cause for the attack is unknown. DiagnosisTreatment Photograph of a halo nevus on a face As halo nevi are only of cosmetic significance, no treatment is required, and patients will be asymptomatic. Although halo nevi are harmless, it is important to monitor the lesion on regular basis. Watch out for any changes in appearance of existing or new halo nevi. If there is any change in appearance or is associated with pain, itch, and infection, a doctor should be consulted immediately to exclude the possibility of melanoma. Epidemiology Halo nevi are estimated to be present in approximately 1% of the general population, and are found to be more prevalent in people with vitiligo, malignant melanoma, or Turner syndrome. All races and sexes are equally susceptible to this disease, although a familial tendency has been reported. The average age of onset is in a person's teenage years.

It is a deciduous shrub or small tree, tall, with ferny leaves, each having multiple leaflets that turn purple in autumn (fall). The fruits, which can last through winter, are crimson, turning to pale pink. They are eaten by birds when there is no other food supply nearby. The specific epithet vilmorinii refers to the 19th century French horticulturalist Maurice de Vilmorin. It grows in a wide range of habitats (mountain slopes, roadsides, mixed forests along river banks, grasslands, bamboo thickets). Sorbus vilmorinii was described based on a specimen in cultivation that was an apomictic microspecies. However, almost indistinguishable specimens are diploid and frequent in the wild. Also hybrids are common in the wild. In cultivation, this plant provides a long season of interest as an elegant, compact tree which can be grown in smaller gardens. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Like all rowans the fruit can be cooked and used to make bitter jellies or marmalades.

It is managed as part of AFB Waterkloof and houses one of the three branches of the South African Air Force Museum. The name of the air force base, Swartkop means Black hill in Afrikaans. AFB Swartkop is located in the town Centurion (previously Verwoerdburg) in the Gauteng Province of South Africa, between Pretoria and Midrand (Johannesburg), which is a part of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality. History Air Force Station (AFS) Zwartkop was established in April 1921 after a private farm named Zwartkop was acquired by the Government in 1920. The Dutch spelling of Zwartkop was retained for the Air Force Station that was subsequently established there. On 1 April 1949, the Dutch spelling was dropped in favour of the Afrikaans spelling and resulted in Air Force Station Swartkop. The Air Force Station was upgraded to an Air Force Base on 1 February 1968. The name of the base reverted to the original \\"Zwartkop\\" in 2012. The SAAF claims Swartkop is the second oldest air station in the world and the oldest operational air station in the world. Over the years many distinguished Squadrons have been based at Swartkop. This includes 26 Squadron SAAF which was formed there on 24 August 1942. The Chief of the South African Air Force opened the relocated South African Air Force Museum at AFB Swartkop in 1993. The Air Force Base reverted to Air Force Station status in 1999. This decision was made by the South African Air Force to vacate the base and leave behind the South African Air Force Museum located there and to keep the Airfield as an extension of Air Force Base Waterkloof. The SAAF Museum Historic Flight has also moved to the airfield. As of December 2013 the South African Air Force still hasn't vacated all operational units on the base. The South African Air Force Museum currently occupies the northern side of the base while 17 Squadron is housed at the southern side of the base.

Originally a work by Philip Massinger dating from 1624, it was controversial in its own era, and may or may not exist today in altered form. History=1624 In December 1624, the King's Men got into trouble with Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, because they performed a play, The Spanish Viceroy, without first obtaining Herbert's license. This step was bound to get them into trouble: Herbert's job was to oversee and censor every play acted in the London theatres, and he was zealous in doing his job, maintaining his authority, and collecting his fees. The outcome was unsurprising, given the way the system of control worked. On 20 December 1624, the King's Men provided Herbert with a \\"submission\\", a written apology, signed by each actor who had taken part in the offending performance. The cast included Robert Benfield, George Birch, John Lowin, Thomas Pollard, John Rice, Richard Robinson, William Rowley, John Shank, Richard Sharpe, Eliard Swanston, and Joseph Taylor. (Herbert copied the submission into his office book in 1633, a sign of the importance he assigned to it.) 1628 On 6 May 1628, another Massinger play was duly licensed, a work titled The Honour of Women. This second play had no immediately obvious connection with The Spanish Viceroy; the connection between them would only appear a quarter-century later. The Honour of Women is one of the plays that was destroyed in the kitchen of John Warburton. (His cook mistook his manuscript collection for scrap paper, and used it up lighting fires and lining pie pans. Some 50 manuscripts, many of them unique copies of plays, were destroyed.) 1653 On 9 September 1653, stationer Humphrey Moseley entered a large number of plays into the Stationers' Register; one of the dramas he registered on that date was titled The Spanish Viceroy, or the Honour of Women. This would appear to indicate that Massinger reworked his 1624 Spanish Viceroy into a new form, which was licensed for performance in 1628 as The Honour of Women. Moseley, however, had a habit of skimping on registration fees by deliberately confusing titles and subtitles, and registering two plays for the price of one.E. H. C. Oliphant, The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher: An Attempt to Determine Their Respective Shares and the Shares of Others, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1927; pp. 94–96. He did this for The Lovers' Progress, The Bashful Lover, The Guardian, and A Very Woman, other plays in the Massinger canon. So there is no guarantee that Spanish Viceroy and Honour of Women were the same play after all. Scholars have been divided on the issue of whether these titles refer to one play, or two.James Phelan, On Philip Massinger, E. Karras, 1878; pp. 55–56. Gondomar and Osuna Early critics developed the argument that The Spanish Viceroy was a play about the Count of Gondomar, the diplomat who had served as Spain's ambassador to England to 1622. The King's Men had made a sensation in August 1624 with their staging of Thomas Middleton's A Game at Chess, with its satiric portrayal of Gondomar. In this view, the King's Men attempted to repeat their controversial success of August 1624 with a similar play in December. There is some reason to think that controversial plays like A Game at Chess were backed by interested factions at Court, and that the King's Men would not have staged such plays without some measure of official support. (Officials supported plays on controversial subjects when it was in their interest to do so, as with Sir John van Olden Barnavelt and The Late Lancashire Witches.) By this reasoning, the actors dared to stage the unlicensed Spanish Viceroy because they had protection from some segment of the Jacobean power structure. The Gondomar hypothesis regarding The Spanish Viceroy is, however, speculative, with no firm evidence to support it. A more modern and perhaps more plausible hypothesis suggests that The Spanish Viceroy was about Pedro Giron, Duke of Osuna, who had served as the viceroy of Sicily and Naples. Osuna was suspected of planning to set himself up as king of an independent kingdom. He was recalled to Spain in 1620, and put on trial; he died in prison.Geoffrey Bullough, \\"The Game at Chesse How It Struck a Contemporary,\\" Modern Language Review Vol. 49 No. 2 (April 1954), pp. 156–63; see p. 160 n. 1. Osuna's story would have been of current interest in 1624, and could have suited the English public's anti-Spanish mood. A Very Woman Neither The Spanish Viceroy nor The Honour of Women has survived under its original title. Yet commentators also developed the hypothesis that The Spanish Viceroy exists in an altered form, as the extant 1634 play A Very Woman.F. G. Fleay, A Biographical Chronicle of English Drama, 1559–1642, Reeves and Turner, 1891; pp. 227–8. This is one of Massinger's collaborations with John Fletcher, and the play does feature a Spanish viceroy of Sicily as a supporting character. Yet plays are normally named after their protagonists, or on rare occasion the protagonists of their comic subplots; they are not named after supporting characters. This makes A Very Woman seem an unlikely candidate for The Spanish Viceroy. A Very Woman also has nothing to do with the Count of Gondomar or the Duke of Osuna.

There he became Guardian of the Franciscan friary in his native city. Membré returned to American and in 1684, along with two other Franciscans and three Sulpicians, sailed with La Salle, intending to found a colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused them to anchor 400 miles (644 km) west, off the coast of Texas near Matagorda Bay. La Salle erected Fort St. Louis, a 50-mile (80 km) overland trek from Matagorda Bay in 1685, near what is now Inez, Texas. Membre endeavored to establish a mission among the Cenis nation (Hasinai). In this he failed. After about two years Membre was killed, along with Father Maximus Le Cerq, Father Chefdeville, and the small garrison which La Salle had left at the settlement.

A Nerf war is an activity involving Nerf Blasters or other foam-firing toy weapons. Nerf wars can be a wide range of games, from informal shootouts in offices and basements to well-organized outdoor battles with high-powered modified blasters. Since foam-firing guns are relatively safe and cheap, Nerf wars can include participants and battlefields otherwise unsuitable for airsoft and paintball. How-to play Nerf wars can take place anywhere. Any area with a good balance of open space and cover can be a candidate. Basements, offices, and backyards are common locations for informal games. For larger wars with more participants, bigger venues like gymnasiums, public parks, forests, ravines, and schools make good playing areas. The inside of a large hall such as a room can may be turned into a battlefield by turning tables onto their sides. When planning a Nerf war in a public area, the organizer typically reserves the space and watches out for non-participants to reduce any liability. The ability to play in free locations is an important element of a Nerf war's accessibility. Organization Nerf Battle in Los Angeles Informal wars are usually ad hoc games played in an office or backyard. These are usually all- out free-for-alls that break out spontaneously and last until the supply of darts has run out. Informal wars in a workplace are a cheap and exciting relief from daily tedium, and an interesting method to build camaraderie. Organized wars are usually more intense, larger in scale, and well-publicized. Typically planned in advance by a group of friends, a Nerf club, or the Nerf Internet Community, these battles are held in large public areas, attract Nerf hobbyists, and usually have standardized rules. Because the games are more competitive and the battlefield larger, blasters are usually modified for increased range. NERF Internet Community (NIC) Wars Many wars across the United States are organized and promoted through the forums of enthusiast sites like OzNerf, PDK Films, NerfRevolution, Nerfhaven, NerfHQ, Foam Universe, and Heart of Nerf. The members of these forums are collectively known as the Nerf Internet Community, or NIC. The NIC holds large annual wars on both the East Coast and West Coast of the United States and certain locations even have bi-annual or monthly wars. All around Australia there are wars as well, and a yearly event called Reign Of Foam. Some colleges and youth groups have active clubs and associations that host Nerf Wars regularly. Rules of participation are set by the war's hosts to create a safer and more balanced game. Over time, the NIC has centered on a widely accepted set of standard rules, regulations, and game types. NERF War Services With the peak of the popularity of Nerf Wars in 2016, Nerf War Parties have been increasing in popularity throughout America. Nerf Party companies are formed all throughout California, Texas, and the East Coast of the United States. A Nerf Gun Party companyin S.F is popularizing the concept of a mobile-based nerf war party.

Predicting adverse events accurately represents a significant challenge to both the pharmaceutical industry and academia, the reason being that our existing knowledge of biology, disease mechanisms (i.e. how a disease affects the healthy state of a human) and drug design is incomplete and sometimes incorrect. On top of that, the biological complexity and differences between living organisms is such that even if a treatment appears to work in the laboratory it may not work in humans. The occurrence of an adverse event during a clinical trial is a significant event, not only because of the risk to humans but also from a financial point of view for the organization (usually a pharmaceutical company) sponsoring the development of the drug in question. As a result a lot of effort is continuously invested in this area and there are a number of approaches to predicting adverse events including cell line assays, animal models and computer based in silico models. In silico models are usually developed by extracting interactions and behaviors of biological systems either from the literature or from experimental data on a specific disease or biological system and integrating this information in some kind of a mathematical model that can be used to understand and predict the behavior of a drug in an organism. Another relatively recent method is based on mining the scientific literature and correlating evidence from seemingly unrelated drugs or medical conditions. If done correctly this type of analysis can offer quite good predictive accuracy and significant lead times which translates to lower cost and development times for new drugs. While in silico methods aim to capture in depth the current knowledge of a biological system or a disease mechanism, they are still subject to the accuracy of that knowledge and may miss information that while seemingly unrelated, could in a multiply interconnected complex biological system prove highly relevant. This gap is addressed by the literature-based discovery approach which does not capture details to the same extent but compensates by offering complete coverage of the available knowledge from all potentially related fields.

The instrument consists of several iron lamellae, fixed to a rectangular wooden soundbox. In Swahili the word imba means song. Kuimba means to sing, as in the phrase \\"nitakwenda kuimba\\" (I go to sing). Swahili, as in many languages, uses a type of binomial nomenclature to create new words to describe unfamiliar or new objects, occurrences or people, based on existing words or concepts. By combining part of the word for mother = ma with the word for song = imba using r as a connector we come up with the word marimba = mother of song. We can then extrapolate from the research of A.M. Jones, quoted by Osborne that ka = small combined with the word imba = song should mean little mother of song. Osborne cites examples of various names for these mbira from all over the continent, which have the Swahili word for song as their root. Admittedly, Swahili, like English, is not a virgin language, but rather a combination of a variety of languages making it useful for trading purposes. However, at the root it's still based on the Bantu languages of the peoples of Central and East Africa, which again is why it is so useful as a language of trade. A cursory examination of the root of these words gives us these common variations: imba, imbe and embe. The following variations are used: likimbe, likembe (Amba of Uganda and the Tabura of the Congo Basin), lulimba (Yao of Malawi, Tanzania and Mozambique), lukembe (Alur and Acholi of Uganda), irimba and kajimba (Makonde of Tanzania and Mozambique), itshilimba (Bemba of Zambia), karimba (Zimbabwe), kalimba and ikembe Bahutu of Rwanda and Burundi. There are many other names for this instrument, but the predominance of names with this root is undeniable. The spelling is not as important as the sound that is made in vocalizing the names.

One of two surviving members of Los Zafiros, he died on July 7, 2011 of cardiac arrest at his home in Havana, Cuba. Biography Manuel Galbán was born on January 14, 1931 and grew up in the small fishing town of Gibara in the Holguín Province of eastern Cuba. After playing guitar and tres in various local youth groups, he got his first professional gig at the age of 14 playing guitar with the Orchestra Villa Blanca. In 1956 he moved to Havana, where he spent seven years playing in bars and clubs and making frequent appearances on radio. In 1963 he joined the legendary vocal group Los Zafiros, after a mutual friend had recommended him to them. His playing proved to be a such hit with Los Zafiros that he was told by singer Miguel Cancio \\"Galbán, from now on you're working with us; you're exactly what we're looking for\\". Galbán was such an essential ingredient to the sound of Los Zafiros that the distinguished Cuban pianist Peruchin once said \\"to replace Galbán you would need two guitarists\\". He left the group in 1972 after working hard for years to allay the personal problems that plagued its various members. Thereafter he spent three years with Cuba's national musical ensemble, Dirección Nacional de Música, and then a further 23 years with the Grupo Batey as a guitarist, vocalist and pianist, touring extensively across four continents. In 1998 he joined the traditional Cuban group Vieja Trova Santiaguera with whom he toured and released two highly acclaimed albums. He also he appeared in the Wim Wenders film Buena Vista Social Club, filmed with Ry Cooder during the sessions for the debut solo album by Ibrahim Ferrer. Later he recorded with Ferrer and Buena Vista Social Club bassist Cachaíto Lopez, leading to his present engagement as the featured guitarist with the touring ensemble named after the film. In 2001 he recorded Mambo Sinuendo with Ry Cooder which won the 2003 Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Says Cooder of the making of the album \\"Galbán and I felt that there was a sound that had not been explored, a Cuban electric-guitar band that could re-interpret the atmosphere of the 1950s with beauty, agility, and simplicity. We decided on two electrics, two drum sets, congas and bass: a sexteto that could swing like a big band and penetrate the mysteries of the classic tunes. This music is powerful, lyrical, and funny; what more could you ask?\\" Style and equipment Galbán's distinctive electric guitar sound makes liberal use of reverb, tremolo, diminished arpeggio runs and palm mutes. Using a Fender Telecaster with heavy gauge strings, he references the tone of Duane Eddy and the early surf guitarists whilst playing the melodic runs and chordal patterns associated with traditional Cuban music. He has been pictured using Fender Twin, Roland JC120 and Fender Bassman amps, as well as a Dunlop TS-1 stereo tremolo pedal.

E.1333:1 to 3-1922 Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre or Mitsukuni Defying the Skeleton Spectre Invoked by Princess Takiyasha () is a ukiyo-e woodblock triptych by Japanese artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1798–1861). Kuniyoshi was known for his depictions of historical and mythical scenes, and combined both in portraying the tenth-century princess Takiyasha summoning a skeleton spectre to frighten Ōya no Mitsukuni. In the image, the princess recites a spell written on a handscroll, summoning a giant skeleton. It rears out of a black void, crashing its way through the tattered palace blinds with its bony fingers to menace Mitsukuni and his companion. A copy of the print is housed in the Honolulu Museum of Art, having been donated by its previous owner, Victor S. K. Houston, in 1941. Historical context The historical Princess Takiyasha was the daughter of the provincial warlord Taira no Masakado of Sōma, who tried to set up an \\"Eastern Court\\" in Shimōsa Province in competition with the emperor in Heian- kyō (modern Kyoto). That rebellion was put down in the year 939 and he was defeated, then decapitated. After his death, Princess Takiyasha continued living in the ruined shōen, or rural manor-house, of the Sōma clan, Masakado's former residence. This print shows a mythical episode in which the emperor's official, Mitsukuni, comes to search for surviving insurrectionary conspirators.

Sijan Hall was built on the south side of the Cadet Area in 1968, in order to accommodate the expansion of the Cadet Wing to a strength of 4,417 cadets. Known simply as the \\"New Dorm\\"For several years it was a popular joke that the building had in fact been named after Madame Nhu, a well-known personality of the time. until its dedication on May 31, 1976, it was named after Captain Lance Sijan '65, the first USAFA graduate to be awarded the Academic buildings The Air Gardens form the east quarter of the Terrazzo Several buildings in the Cadet Area are used for academics. Fairchild Hall, named after General Muir S. Fairchild, the first commander of Air University and later Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, is the main academic building. Fairchild Hall houses academic classrooms, laboratories, research facilities, faculty offices. The Robert F. McDermott Library is a separate building. The Aeronautics Research Center (also known as the \\"Aero Lab\\") is just south of Fairchild Hall and contains numerous aeronautical research facilities, including transonic, subsonic, low speed and cascade wind tunnels, engine and rocket test cells The Consolidated Education and Training Facility (CETF) was built in 1997 as an annex to Fairchild Hall.

In the Roman Republic, citizens did not elect legislative representatives. Instead, they voted themselves on legislative matters in the popular assemblies (the comitia centuriata, the tribal assembly and the plebeian council). Bills were proposed by magistrates and the citizens only exercised their right to vote. In the Tribal Assembly, citizens were organized on the basis of 35 tribes: four urban tribes of the citizens in the city of Rome, and 31 rural tribes of citizens outside the city. Each tribe voted separately and one after the other. In each tribe, decisions were made by majority vote and its decision counted as one vote regardless of how many electors each tribe held. Once a majority of tribes voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended and the matter was decided.Taylor, L. R., Roman Voting Assemblies, p. 40 The Tribal Assembly was chaired by a magistrate, usually a consul or a praetor. The presiding magistrate made all decisions on matters of procedure and legality. His power over the assembly could be nearly absolute. One check on his power came in the form of vetoes by other magistrates. Also, any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by the plebeian tribunes. The Tribal Assembly elected the quaestors, and the curule aediles.Taylor, L. R., Roman Voting Assemblies, p. 7 It conducted trials for non-capital punishment cases. However, the Roman Dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla reassigned this to special jury courts (quaestiones perpetuae) in 82 BC. There are disagreements among modern historians regarding the number and nature of the tribal assembly (see below). Definitions of types assemblies The Romans distinguished between two types of assemblies, the comitia (or comitatus) and the contio (contracted from conventio). The word comitia (going together), which was the plural of comitium (a purpose-built meeting place), referred to assemblies convened to make decisions on legislative or judicial matters or to hold elections. The word contio (coming together) referred to meetings where 'nothing was legally enacted'. They were convened to hear public announcements and pronouncements, speeches and debates, witness the interrogation of someone accused of in a trial and to watch executions. Opinions expressed in a contio did not have any legal validity.Lintott, A.,The Constitution of the Roman Republic, p. 42 The tribal assembly was a comitia. Private citizens who did not hold political office could make speeches in a contio, but not before a comitia or a concilium.Abbott, F. F., A History and Description of Roman Political Institutions, p. 252 Voters always assembled first in a contio to hear debates or to enable canvassing by electoral candidates before voting. The actual voting took place in a comitia or concilium (for this term, see below).Taylor,L. R., Roman Voting Assemblies, p. 2 Gellius wrote about a further distinction between comita and concilium, which he based on a quote from a passage written by Laelius Felix, an early second century AD jurist: This has been taken as referring to the assembly which was reserved for the plebeians (or plebs, the commoners), thus excluding the patricians (the aristocracy), and which was convened by the tribunes of the plebs (also called by modern historians plebeian tribunes) – see plebeian council. Since the meetings of the plebs excluded the patricians, they were not considered as representing the whole of the Roman people and because of this, according to Laelius Felix, the term concilium applied to them. By contrast, the term comitia applied to assemblies which represented the whole of the Roman people. Measures passed by assemblies of the whole citizen body were called leges (laws), whereas those passed only by the plebeians were called plebiscites (resolutions of the plebs). Until the lex Hortensia passed by Quintus Hortensius in 287 BC, the patricians refused to accept the plebiscites as being binding on them on the ground that, because of their exclusion, did not apply to the whole of the people. Disagreements on the number and nature of tribal assemblies Chart showing the checks and balances of the constitution of the Roman Republic Andrew Lintott notes that many modern historians follow Theodor Mommsen's view that during the Roman Republic there were two assemblies of the tribes and that the ancient sources used the term comitia tributa with reference both of them. One was the assembly by the tribes which was used for plebeian meetings to which the patricians were excluded and which was convened by the plebeian tribunes. The other assembly based on the tribes was convened by the Roman consuls or the praetors and was an assembly of the whole of the Roman people (both patricians and plebeians). However, the ancient sources did not have a differentiation in terminology for the two of them and used the term comitia tributa for both.Lintott, A., The Constitution of the Roman Republic, p. 53 Many modern historians use the term comitia tributa or comitia populi tributa (comitia tributa of the people) to indicate meetings by the tribes which involved the whole of the Roman people (populus) and the term concilium plebis or concilium plebis tributum (plebeian council by the tribes) for assemblies based on the tribes which were exclusively for the plebeians. However, they are not found in the ancient Roman literature related to the Roman Republic. Therefore, they denote a distinction which can be disputed. It is based on the text by Gellius quoted above. Lintott notes that some modern historians reject the comitia tributa/concilium plebis distinction and the use of the quote by Gellius as its basis. They argue that this terminology is a convention established by modern historians which ancient writers did not make and that there was no assembly based on tribes other than the one where the plebeians met to vote and which was presided over by the plebeian tribunes, who submitted bills to its vote. References to laws which were submitted to the comitia tributa by the consuls in the ancient literature must have pertained to bills they presented to the comitia centuriata (the assembly of the soldiers, another voting assembly), a deviation from correct procedure found in the late Republic or instances in which these officials got the plebeian tribunes to propose bills for them.Develin, E., Comitia Tributa Plebis', Athenaeum (1975) 53, pp. 302–37; \\"'Comitia Tributa Again', Athenaeum (1977) 55, pp. 425–6Sandberg, K., The Concilium Plebis as a Legislative Body', in Paanen, U., et al, Senatus Populesque Romanus: Studies in Roman Republican Legislation, (Acta Inst. Rom. Fin 13) (1993), pp. 74–96 Lintott disagrees with the notion that there was only one assembly based on the tribes, which was the one of the plebeians. He notes that there are examples in which laws were proposed to the comitia tributa by the consuls, who did not preside over the assembly of the plebeians. Examples of such laws are the law which increased the number of quaestors to twenty, which was attributed to Lucius Cornelius Sulla, the lex Gabinia Calpurnia de insula Delo of 58 BC and the lex Quinctia of 9 BC. Moreover, the consuls conducted the elections of the curule aediles, who were not plebeian officials, before the tribes. Therefore, it is likely that the term comitia tributa was used both for the assemblies presided over by the consuls and the praetors and the assemblies presided over by the plebeian tribunes.Lintott, A., The Constitution of the Roman Republic, pp. 54–55 One could add to this that Livy mentioned a comitia tributa which was convened by the consuls in 446 BC; that is, during the early Republic.Livy, The History of Rome, 3.71 Forsythe presents a more recent account of the argument that the comitia tributa/concilium plebis distinction is a misplaced convention established by modern historians. He argues that it is found only in the quote by Gellius which comes from a text which was written in the imperial period; that is, after the fall of the Roman Republic and long after the assemblies of the Republic had ceased to function. This implies that Laelius Felix was not sufficiently familiar with these republican institutions. Forsythe argues that the distinctions between two assemblies based on the tribes \\"has no support in the extensive writings of Cicero and Livy, who must have been far more knowledgeable in these matters than Laelius Felix.\\" Cicero lived during the late Republic. Livy was born during the late Republic and wrote a detailed history of the republican period. Forsythe also argues that the word comitia was used for formal assemblies convened 'to vote on legislative, electoral and judicial matters', and that concilium was a generic term 'for any kind of public meetings of citizens, including both comitia and contio.' His conclusion is that the mentioned distinction is an artificial modern construction with no authority in ancient texts, that 'the ancients speak only of a comitia tributa' and that it is likely that in Republican times there was a single tribal assembly known as comitia tributa.Forsythe, G., A critical History of Early Rome, pp. 180–81 According to the Roman tradition, in 494 BC, fifteen years after the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the Roman Republic, the Plebeiany temporarily seceded from the city of Rome, which started the two hundred-year Conflict of the Orders between the Patricians (the aristocracy) and the Plebeians (the commoners). During this first secession, the plebeians created their own institutions which were separate from those of the Roman state, which at that time was controlled by the patricians, and were intended to protect the interests of the plebeians. These included the plebeian tribunes, the plebeian aediles and the plebeian assembly. Forsythe takes the revisionist view further. He rejects the idea there was a plebeian assembly and maintains that the comitia tributa was an assembly of the whole of the Roman people and opines that the plebeian secession was a myth created in later times. Roman historians emerged in the late third and early second century BC, some three hundred year after the date attributed to this secession and the events of Rome's early history were poorly documented. Based on T. P. Wiseman's view that many of Rome's early historical traditions 'were created, propagated, accepted and reshaped' from the middle of the fourth century BC onward through dramas played on the stage at religious festivalsWiseman, T. P., Remus, a Roman Myth (1995), p. 129 Forsythe argues that the story of the plebeian secession was invented in one such performances to explain the origin of the temple of Ceres and its plebeian associations. It was inspired by Herodotus' account of how Telines, a ruler of Gela, a Greek town in Sicily, used the rites of Demeter and Persephone to bring back to Gela a group of political exiles. This story of civil discord, reconciliation and integration and the cult of Demeter was used to fabricate the tale of the first plebeian secession where the plebeians seceded from Rome but were then reconciled and returned to the city.Forsythe, G., A Critical History of Early Rome, pp. 172–75 The Ludi Ceriales (the games of Ceres) were held annually to celebrate the anniversary of the dedication of the temple of Ceres, which was dated by the tradition two years before the first secession.Dionysius of Halicanassus, Roman Antiquities, 6.17.3  Assembly procedures  The convening of the assembly was announced three market-days (nundinae) in advance. The viatores (messengers) were sent \\"to inform those in country districts\\" about the convening of the assembly.Appian, The Civil Wars, 1.29 Later, for elections it was established that there should be a trinundinum, an interval of at least three market-days between the announcement of the election and the vote of the assembly, during which no legislation was permitted. The lex Caecilia Didia of 98 BC required a trinundinum interval between the announcement of a law and the vote. In the case of prosecutions before an assembly, the magistrate who presided over it was required to give \\"notice (diem dicere) to the accused of the first day of the investigation (inquisitio), then at the end of each hearing he announced the adjournment to the next (diem prodicere). After this there was a trinundinum interval before the assembly voted the verdict.Lintott, A.,The Constitution of the Roman Republic, pp. 44–45 There are disagreements among scholars about how many days this interval lasted. Mommsen proposes 24 days, Michels 25 days. Lintott gives a flexible suggestion, 17 days or more.Mommsen. T., Romische Staadtrecht (1887), I, pp. 375–6Michels, A. K., The Calendar of the Roman Republic (1967), pp. 88, 191ff.Lintott, A.,The Constitution of the Roman Republic, p. 44 There could be only one assembly operating at a time. The augur Marcus Valerius Messalla Rufus (who was consul in 53 BC) wrote a rule book (On Auspices). Among other things, it established that lesser magistrates could not call off (avocare, call away) an assembly which had already been convened. Thus, \\"whoever of them first summons the people to an election has the law on his side, because it is unlawful to take the same action twice with the people nor can one minor magistrate call away an assembly from another.\\" However, a consul could call off a comitia or contio convened by another magistrate and a praetor could call off one summoned by other magistrates except a consul. If an assembly was called \\"to address a contio without laying any measure before them, it is lawful for any number of magistrates to hold a contio at the same time.\\" Gellius, Attic Nights, 13.16 Lintott suggests that this rule was intended to prevent rivalry among magistrates. In addition to the presiding magistrate of an assembly there were several other magistrates to act as assistants. They were available to help resolve procedural disputes and to provide a mechanism for electors to appeal the decisions of the presiding magistrate.Taylor, L. R., Roman Voting Assemblies, p. 63 Since the Romans believed that the gods communicated their approval or disapproval with proposed actions, the presiding magistrate performed augury (the divination of the omens of the gods) the night before a meeting. There were also augurs (priests who performed augury), either in attendance or on-call, who would be available to help interpret the omens of the gods.Taylor, L.R., Roman Voting Assemblies, pp. 6, 63 The meeting could only proceed if the omens were favourable. On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavourable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. If after the assembly the augurs decided that some formality had been neglected, its vote became void. In the case of elections, those persons had been elected to an office had to resign.Smith, W., Wayte, W., Marindin, G. E., (Eds), A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (1890): Comitia There were several cases in which an assembly could be adjourned. On religious grounds, this could happen, besides when the auspices were found to be unfavourable, when the gods manifested their displeasure by rain, thunder, or lightning or if the sun set before the proceedings were completed – this was because the auspices were considered to be valid only for one day from dawn to sunset. Other reasons were the veto of a plebeian tribune and one of the assembled citizens suffering an epileptic fit (morbus comitialis). In the politically volatile years of the late Republic, at times assemblies were broken up by riots. If an assembly convened as a court, its being broken up was equivalent to an acquittal of the accused. On the day of the vote the tribes convened at dawn. The meeting started with a prayer, unaccompanied by sacrifice.Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, Second Edition, Harry Thurston Peck, Editor (1897): Comitia For legislative meetings the presiding magistrate was the one who proposed the bill (rogatio legis) to be voted on and after the prayer he laid his bill before the people. For electoral meetings, he announced the names of the candidates. If the meeting was for a trial, he made the people acquainted with the nature of the offence on which the people had to pass a verdict. He concluded the announcement with the words velitis, jubeatis Quirites (command your wish, citizens). A rogatio was read out by the praeco (the crier or herald). Then the contio begun. The voters were not sorted into their tribes. For legislative matters there was a debate on the rogatio in which private citizens had to ask the presiding magistrate for permission to speak. This debate took place before the bill was either vetoed or put to the vote.Lintott, A., The Constitution of the Roman Republic, p. 45 If the vote was for an election, the candidates used the contio for canvassing and there were no speeches by private citizens.Taylor, L. R., Roman Voting Assemblies. pp. 2, 16 After the above, the voters were told to break up the contio and to arrange themselves by the tribes with the formula discedite, quirites (depart to your separate groups, citizens). The tribes voted one by one. The voters assembled in enclosures called saeptaTaylor, L. R., Roman Voting Assemblies, p. 2 and voted by placing a pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar. The baskets (cistae) that held the votes were watched by officers (the custodes) who then counted the ballots and reported the results to the presiding magistrate.Lintott, A., The Constitution of the Roman Republic, pp. 46–47 The majority of votes in each tribe decided how that tribe voted. The presiding magistrate (either a consul or a praetor), always ensured that all tribes had at least five members voting, and if a tribe did not, individuals from other tribes were reassigned to the vacant places in that tribe.Taylor, L. R., Roman Voting Assemblies, p. 66 The order in which the tribes voted was determined by lot. An urn into which lots were cast was brought in. From then on, the plebeian tribunes were not allowed to exercise their right to veto.Lintott, A.,The Constitution of the Roman Republic, p. 46 The first tribe to vote was called praerogativa or principium and the result of its vote was announced immediately.Taylor, L. R., Roman Voting Assemblies, p. 77 The tribes which voted next were called jure vocatae. When a majority of tribes had voted the same way, voting ended. The results of votes of each tribe was announced in an order also determined by lot before the announcement of the final result. This announcement was called renuntiatio. The praerogativa or principium was usually the most important tribe, because it often decided the matter through a bandwagon effect. It was believed that the order of the lot was chosen by the gods, and thus, that the position held by the tribes which voted earlier was the position of the gods.Taylor, L. R.,Roman Voting Assemblies, p. 76 If the voting process was not complete by nightfall, the electors were dismissed and the voting had to begin again the next day.Lintott, A.,The Constitution of the Roman Republic, p. 48 Laws passed by the comitia took effect as soon as the results were announced. It has been speculated that the word suffragium (vote) indicates that in the early days the men in the assembly made a crash with their arms to signal approval, rather than vote. Another speculation is that the term rogatores (sing. rogator, a teller, an official who asked the people for their votes or collected votes) indicates that in later times, but before the introduction of the written ballot, the assembled men were asked to express their votes verbally and that this was recorded with marks inscribed in tablets. However, there is no evidence for either of these. The written ballot was introduced by a series of laws, the lex Gabinia tabellaria (139 BC) for elections, the lex Cassia tebellaria (137 BC) for non-capital punishment trials, the lex Papiria (131 BC) for legislation, and the lex Coelia (106 BC) for capital punishment trials (which were conducted before the comitia centuriata). This was an introduction of secret ballots which reduced undue influence or intimidation by the powerful elites, which was at times a problem during votes.Lintott, A., The Constitution of the Roman Republic, pp. 46–7 Although the order of voting was determined by lot, there was also an official order of the tribes, known as the ordo tribuum. The first four tribes were the urban tribes, in the order: Suburana, Palatina, Esquilina, Collina. The rural tribes followed, concluding with Aniensis. Crawford postulates that the rustic tribes were enumerated along the major roads leading from Rome (the Viae Ostiensis, Appia, Latina, Praenestina, Valeria, Salaria, Flaminia and Clodia), in a counter- clockwise order: Romilia, Voltinia, Voturia, Aemilia, Horatia, Maecia, Scaptia, Pomptina, Falerina, Lemonia, Papiria, Ufentina, Terentina, Pupinia, Menenia, Publilia, Cornelia, Claudia, Camilia, Aniensis, Fabia, Pollia, Sergia, Clustumina, Quirina, Velina, Stellatina, Tromentina, Galeria, Sabatina, Arniensis. This list omits the tribus Popillia, one of the earlier tribes.Crawford, M. H., \\"Tribus, Tesserae, et Regions,\\" in Comptes rendus de l'Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (2002) vol. 146, pp. 1125–1135 The location of the meetings of the Tribal Assembly varied. Up to 145 BC were centred on comitium, a templum an open-air space, built for public meetings at the north end of the Roman Forum. The rostra, a speaking platform on its southern side of the comitium, was used for speeches. It was also used as a tribunal; that is, as a platform to deliver the votes. Then this place became too cramped and the steps of the Temple of Castor and Pollux at the forum's south-east end were used as the tribunal. Elevated gangways (pontes) which provided access to it were built by the second century BC. Meetings were also sometimes held in the area Capitolina, an open space in front and around the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, on the southern summit of the Capitoline Hill. In the late Republic the meetings were held outside the city walls, at the Campus Martius (the Field of Mars) a large flat area which could accommodate the simultaneous voting of the tribes and thus speed up the process.Lintott, A., The Constitution of the Roman Republic, pp. 46, 55 Decline In the politically volatile and highly corrupt final years of the Roman Republic, the popular assemblies were susceptible to corruption and vulnerable to politically motivated violence by contenting political factions. The establishment of the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC effective abolished the functions of the comitia, as the triumvirs were granted authority by the lex Titia to appoint practically all offices without consulting the senate or the people. Some actions were still passed using the assemblies, with certain laws providing for the erection of temples, the remission of rents in 41 BC, and the lex Falcidia governing inheritance in 40 BC; similarly, various laws granting the triumvirs the right to wear the civic crown were passed by plebiscite, as it would have been unseemly for them to simply have granted themselves those honours. With the establishment of absolute rule by emperors after the fall of the Republic, the Republican assemblies were emasculated. Augustus, the first Roman emperor, became the real legislator and the comitia's role in passing laws became only a ceremonial one. He also removed the comitia's judicial functions, though these functions had fallen into disuse long before. This assembly's electoral functions also become only nominal, with the assemblies effectively being dominated by the emperor. Augustus filled half of the magistracies with his own candidates, though the magistracies as a whole had, by this point, so little political importance that imperial control over elections was minimal. His successor, Tiberius transferred the comitia's remaining electoral authority to the senate. Although the emperors received many of their powers from the comitia tributa, this was only a formality. The comitia tributa continued to exist until the third century AD, but its remaining functions were only symbolic. It took auspices and gave prayer. It conferred the emperor's legislative powers and other authority only in a ceremonial manner. It proclaimed the laws presented to it for approval by acclamatio, rather than a real vote. Tribes The 35 tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but geographic divisions into which Roman citizens were distributed. They were administrative districts which served for the purposes of taxation, the military levy and for the registration of Roman citizens. This registration occurred regularly during the census and the names of citizens and their families were entered in the registers of the tribes. Lintott notes that 'the tribe was the critical indicator of Roman citizenship' for the adult sons of Roman fathers and also for 'those incorporated into the citizen body from the outside'. A man who came of age was enrolled as a new adult in the tribe of his father and could change it only through adoption into another family. Inhabitants of Italic towns who were incorporated into the Roman state by being given Roman citizenship were also registered in tribes. Consequently, \\"the tribe might therefore, came to bear little relationship to the whereabouts of the citizen's domicile or property.\\" Lintott, A., The Constitution of the Roman Republic, p. 51 With regard to the tribal assembly, the tribes were its voting districts. Each tribe had further subdivisions, which in the urban tribes were called vici (sing. vicus, in an urban context it meant neighbourhood) and in the rural tribes were called pagi (sing. pagus – which were rural sub- districts with a number of vici (which in a rural context meant villages and hamlets) and had a fortress. Professional guilds (collegia), were organised along tribal lines. The tribes were originally presided over by tribuni aerarii (tribunes of the public treasury) who had the tribal register and collected the property tax and paid the soldiers registered in the tribe.Oxford Classical Dictionary, 2nd Ed. (1970): \\"Tribuni Aerarii.\\" Later this title became obsolete and the heads of the tribes were called curatores tribuum.Smith, W., Wayte, W., Marindin, G. E., (Eds), A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (1890): Tribus Besides these curatores there were also the divisores tribuum who were treasurers. These two types of officials probably had their own registers; the curatores were involved in the census. By the late republic, their main task was to distribute bribes. Because tribal membership was re-registered once every five years in each census, it became possible to crudely gerrymander the tribes. While land could never be taken away from a tribe, the \\"censors\\" had the power to allocate new lands to existing tribes as a part of the Census. Thus, the censors had the power to apportion tribes in a manner that might be advantageous to them or to their partisans.

Variants * EF64-0: Numbers EF64 1 – 79 (built from 1964 to 1976) * EF64-1000: Numbers EF64 1001 – 1053 (built from 1980 to 1982) History=EF64-0 subclass The class was designed to replace the ageing EF16 class locomotives used on the steeply-graded Ou and Chuo mainlines in the early 1960s. Two prototype locomotives, EF64 1 and 2, were delivered in 1964, built by Toshiba and Kawasaki Sharyo respectively. The basic body design was based on that of the earlier Class EF62s but with the more usual Japanese Bo-Bo-Bo wheel arrangement. Livery from the start was all-over blue with just the lower cab ends painted cream. Full production started in 1965, continuing to 1976 with loco EF64 79. Minor variations within the class included the discontinuation of the cab ventilation grilles above the marker lights from EF64 46 onward. Locos EF64 1 to 12 and EF64 29 to 55 were equipped with train-heating generators for passenger use, and are distinguishable by the train heating indicator lights next to the cab doors. The DT120A/DT121A bogies were virtually identical to those used on the Class EF70. The first batch of locos, consisting of EF64 1 to 12, were assigned to the Ōu Main Line between Fukushima and Yonezawa, where their duties included assisting KiHa 80 Tsubasa DMUs over the steep gradients. The second batch, from EF64 13 onward, were allocated to the Chuo Main Line for use primarily on freight duties. With the conversion of the Ou Main Line from 1,500 V DC to 20 kV AC electrification in October 1968, the first 12 locos were transferred to the Chuo Main Line. Nowadays, with the exception of a handful of locos owned by JR East/Central/West for charter and occasional passenger haulage, the subclass is divided evenly between Shiojiri and Aichi depots (JR Freight) at either end of the Chuo Line. EF64-1000 subclass The first EF64-1000, EF64 1001, appeared in 1980 for use on the Joetsu Line, replacing ageing Class EF15/16 and EF58 locomotives. This subclass could almost be described as a totally new design. The body was lengthened from 17,900 mm to 18,600, and the bodysides were given an asymmetrical appearance with ventilation grilles at one end and windows at the other. PS22 scissors-type pantographs replaced the PS17 lozenge-type pantographs of the EF64-0s. The bogies were the same DT138A/DT139A type as used on Class EF81 locomotives. A total of 53 EF64-1000s were built by 1982, all by Kawasaki and Toyo Electric. Locos from EF64 1033 onward were built without train-heating generators. Apart from a handful of locos owned by JR East and based at Takasaki and Nagaoka depots for use on sleeper and charter train haulage, the subclass is largely based at Takasaki for Joetsu Line freight duties. Locos EF64 1046 to 1050, however, are based at Okayama depot for use on Hakubi Line freight duties. EF64 1030 and 1031, owned by JR East, both have EMU-couplers and jumper sockets, and these locos are frequently used for hauling new rolling stock from the Niitsu factory to Tokyo via the Jōetsu Line, and also for hauling withdrawn rolling stock to Nagano.

Refurbishment was carried out at Omiya and Hiroshima Works, with locos initially released in the JR Freight livery of two-tone blue and light grey. Minor livery variations were implemented during the programme, and locos treated at Hiroshima were distinguished by having mustard-coloured cab gangway doors. From 2004 onward, the JR Freight livery was simplified by using a single shade of dark blue and light grey. The first EF64-1000, EF64 1015, also underwent refurbishment in 2003, appearing in the then-standard JR Freight two-tone blue and light grey livery. However, following complaints from staff about the difficulties in visually distinguishing the loco from refurbished EF65s, a new livery was devised and applied to the next loco to be refurbished, EF64 1009, consisting of standard blue with broad white diagonal bands and large red \\"JRF\\" bodyside logos. The first Okayama-based EF64-1000, EF64 1047 was refurbished in July 2006 at Hiroshima Works, and this was released in a further simplified livery of all-over blue with white bodyside stripe and light grey lower cab front.

Their solution follows from the odds-strategy, and the importance of the odds-strategy lies in its optimality, as explained below. The odds- algorithm applies to a class of problems called last-success-problems. Formally, the objective in these problems is to maximize the probability of identifying in a sequence of sequentially observed independent events the last event satisfying a specific criterion (a \\"specific event\\"). This identification must be done at the time of observation. No revisiting of preceding observations is permitted. Usually, a specific event is defined by the decision maker as an event that is of true interest in the view of \\"stopping\\" to take a well-defined action. Such problems are encountered in several situations. Examples Two different situations exemplify the interest in maximizing the probability to stop on a last specific event. # Suppose a car is advertised for sale to the highest bidder (best \\"offer\\"). Let n potential buyers respond and ask to see the car. Each insists upon an immediate decision from the seller to accept the bid, or not. Define a bid as interesting, and coded 1 if it is better than all preceding bids, and coded 0 otherwise. The bids will form a random sequence of 0s and 1s. Only 1s interest the seller, who may fear that each successive 1 might be the last. It follows from the definition that the very last 1 is the highest bid. Maximizing the probability of selling on the last 1 therefore means maximizing the probability of selling best. # A physician, using a special treatment, may use the code 1 for a successful treatment, 0 otherwise. The physician treats a sequence of n patients the same way, and wants to minimize any suffering, and to treat every responsive patient in the sequence. Stopping on the last 1 in such a random sequence of 0s and 1s would achieve this objective. Since the physician is no prophet, the objective is to maximize the probability of stopping on the last 1. (See Compassionate use.)  Definitions  Consider a sequence of n independent events. Associate with this sequence another sequence I_1,\\\\, I_2,\\\\, \\\\dots ,\\\\, I_n with values 1 or 0. Here \\\\,I_k =1, called a success, stands for the event that the kth observation is interesting (as defined by the decision maker), and \\\\, I_k=0 for non-interesting. We observe independent random variables I_1,\\\\, I_2,\\\\, \\\\dots ,\\\\, I_n sequentially and want to select the last success. Let \\\\,p_k = P( \\\\,I_k\\\\,=1) be the probability that the kth event is interesting. Further let \\\\,q_k = \\\\,1- p_k and \\\\,r_k = p_k/q_k.Note that \\\\,r_k represents the odds of the kth event turning out to be interesting, explaining the name of the odds- algorithm.  Algorithmic procedure The odds-algorithm sums up the odds in reverse order : r_n + r_{n-1} + r_{n-2}\\\\, +\\\\cdots, \\\\, until this sum reaches or exceeds the value 1 for the first time. If this happens at index s, it saves s and the corresponding sum : R_s = \\\\,r_n + r_{n-1} + r_{n-2} + \\\\cdots + r_s. \\\\, If the sum of the odds does not reach 1, it sets s = 1\\\\. At the same time it computes : Q_{s}=q_n q_{n-1}\\\\cdots q_s.\\\\, The output is # \\\\,s, the stopping threshold # \\\\,w = Q_s R_s, the win probability.  Odds-strategy The odds-strategy is the rule to observe the events one after the other and to stop on the first interesting event from index s onwards (if any), where s is the stopping threshold of output a. The importance of the odds-strategy, and hence of the odds-algorithm, lies in the following odds-theorem. Odds- theorem  The odds-theorem states that # The odds-strategy is optimal, that is, it maximizes the probability of stopping on the last 1. # The win probability of the odds-strategy equals \\\\,w= Q_s R_s # If \\\\, R_s \\\\ge \\\\,1 , the win probability \\\\, w is always at least \\\\,1/e = 0.368\\\\dots, and this lower bound is best possible. Features The odds-algorithm computes the optimal strategy and the optimal win probability at the same time. Also, the number of operations of the odds-algorithm is (sub)linear in n. Hence no quicker algorithm can possibly exist for all sequences, so that the odds- algorithm is, at the same time, optimal as an algorithm. Sources devised the odd-algorithm, and coined its name. It is also known as Bruss-algorithm (strategy). Free implementations can be found on the web. Applications Applications reach from medical questions in clinical trials over sales problems, secretary problems, portfolio selection, (one-way) search strategies, trajectory problems and the parking problem to problems in on-line maintenance and others. There exists, in the same spirit, an Odds-Theorem for continuous-time arrival processes with independent increments such as the Poisson process{}. In some cases, the odds are not necessarily known in advance (as in Example 2 above) so that the application of the odds-algorithm is not directly possible. In this case each step can use sequential estimates of the odds. This is meaningful, if the number of unknown parameters is not large compared with the number n of observations. The question of optimality is then more complicated, however, and requires additional studies. Generalizations of the odds-algorithm allow for different rewards for failing to stop and wrong stops as well as replacing independence assumptions by weaker ones (Ferguson (2008)).  Variations  discussed a problem of selecting the last k successes. proved a multiplicative odds theorem which deals with a problem of stopping at any of the last \\\\ell successes. A tight lower bound of win probability is obtained by . discussed a problem of selecting k out of the last \\\\ell successes and obtained a tight lower bound of win probability. When \\\\ell= k = 1, the problem is equivalent to Bruss' odds problem. If \\\\ell= k \\\\geq 1, the problem is equivalent to that in . A problem discussed by is obtained by setting \\\\ell \\\\geq k=1. multiple choice problem: A player is allowed r choices, and he wins if any choice is the last success. For classical secretary problem, discussed the cases r=2,3,4. The odds problem with r=2, 3 is discussed by . For further cases of odds problem, see . An optimal strategy belongs to the class of strategies defined by a set of threshold numbers (a_1, a_2, ... , a_r), where a_1. The first choice is to be used on the first candidates starting with a_1th applicant, and once the first choice is used, second choice is to be used on the first candidate starting with a_2th applicant, and so on. When r=2 , showed that the tight lower bound of win probability is equal to e^{-1}+ e^{-\\\\frac{3}{2}}. For general positive integer r, discussed the tight lower bound of win probability. When r=3,4,5 , tight lower bounds of win probabilities are equal to e^{-1}+ e^{-\\\\frac{3}{2}}+e^{-\\\\frac{47}{24}} , e^{-1}+e^{-\\\\frac{3}{2}}+e^{-\\\\frac{47}{24}}+e^{-\\\\frac{2761}{1152}} and e^{-1}+e^{-\\\\frac{3}{2}}+e^{-\\\\frac{47}{24}}+e^{-\\\\frac{2761}{1152}}+e^{-\\\\frac{4162637}{1474560}}, respectively.

When he decided to move to Houston, Texas, USA, in 2008, the State of Texas decided to give a major US $ 5.5 million research grant to the University of Houston, enabling the establishment of the Center of Nuclear Receptors and Cell Signaling under the leadership of Jan-Åke Gustafsson. The grant was announced at a February 5, 2009, press conference by Rick Perry, Governor of Texas and running for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2012 presidential election. Recruiting top international scientists, world-leaders in their respective field, and providing them with grants to enable them to establish top scientific institutions in Texas, is part of the government of the State of Texas' vision to establish top-tier research and educational institutions in the state, institutions that will be able to rival the top institutions on the American East and West Coasts. The importance of research and scientific progress to the senior levels of the Texas government was illustrated by personal interest that governor Rick Perry took in the recruitment of professor Gustafsson and the establishment of the center. Jan- Åke Gustafsson holds two parallel professorships: Robert A. Welch Professor of Biology and Biochemistry (80%) at the University of Houston's Department of Biology and Biochemistry, as well as Professor of Medical Nutrition (20%) at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden. Gustafsson is one of Europe's leading scientists in the fields of medicine and natural science.Svenska Dagbladet: Toppforskare går till USA Jan-Åke Gustafsson has received numerous international and national scientific awards, honorary doctor- and professorships, e.g. Honorary professor of the Beijing University in Beijing, People's Republic of China; Honorary doctor of the University of Chongqing, Chongqing, PRC; Honorary Doctor of the University of Milan, Milan, Italy; the Lorenzini Foundation's Gold Medal, Lorenzini Foundation, Milan, Italy and the Nordic Fernström Prize, often referred to as the \\"Little Nobel Prize\\", the Fernström Foundation, Copenhagen, Denmark. He is one of the scientists in Sweden that receives the largest annual research and science grants, i.e. government- and private funding, for his research projects. Gustafsson is most well known for his longstanding accomplishments in the field of nuclear receptors, including his discovery of the previously unknown estrogen receptor beta. His work at the University of Houston is focused on establishing academic and industry collaborations with the goal of finding new treatments for diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Jan-Åke Gustafsson received his PhD from the Karolinska institutet in 1968, followed by an MD from the same university in 1971. Founder of the Novum Research Park in Flemingsberg and listed company Karo Bio AB Jan-Åke Gustafsson and APJ Abdul Kalam at the University of Houston Center for Nuclear Receptors and Cell Signaling. Kalam served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He has an academic background as an Aerospace engineer, professor, and chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST) and was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor in 1997. He is the founder of the Novum Research Park, a research park geared towards biotechnology and medicine at the Karolinska institutet, campus Huddinge He was also one of the leading proponents behind locating the Södertörn University College, southern Stockholm's new university, to Huddinge.www.flemingsberg.se Flemingsbergsforskare mottar det Nordiska Fernströmpriset Institutions of higher learning and research have traditionally been located to the northern parts of the Stockholm county. Establishing a leading research park and a new university in Huddinge, with special reference to Flemingsberg, is part of a broader vision of achieving a regional balance: stimulating economic growth and enabling southern Stockholm to catch up with the wealthier northern parts of the county. Since the establishment of the research park and university was initiated, several other government and private organizations have followed suit, establishing a presence in the area. In 1997, Stockholm Syd-Flemingsberg, southern Stockholm's major national- and regional-train hub was established in the area, giving excellent communications with central Stockholm. It was Jan-Åke Gustafsson's strong track record of establishing a leading research center with close connections to biotech companies, in addition to his outstanding scientific achievements and world-wide scientific reputation, that convinced the State of Texas government of hiring him for the establishment of a new major research center in a similar guise, at the University of Houston. Jan- Åke Gustafsson is the founder of Karo Bio AB, a biotechnology company listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange and based in the Novum Research Park. He is also the coordinator for the European Union-financed research network CASCADE. Memberships Gustafsson is member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences since 1997 and the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences since 1998. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2002 and Foreign Honorary Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences since 2004. He is also a member of the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institutet, having served as its chairman 2002-2004. Jan-Åke Gustafsson is a member of the board of several leading international scientific journals, including Steroids, The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Molecular Endocrinology, Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, The Prostate, Anticancer Research, Japanese Journal of Cancer Research, Journal of Molecular Medicine, Molecular Pharmacology, Cell Metabolism, Experimental Biology and Medicine and the International Journal of Oncology.CV of Honorary professor of Peking University  Scientific discoveries  In the mid-1990s, Gustafsson's research group at the Karolinska Institutet discovered estrogen receptor-beta, which plays a pivotal role in the function of the brain, lungs, and immune system. Today, drugs are being developed to stimulate that receptor to battle a number of diseases, including breast, prostate and lung cancers. In some instances, the abnormal cell division that creates cancerous tumors can be slowed down or stopped by stimulating the receptor. Additional discoveries include early demonstration of the three-domain structure of nuclear receptors, specific binding of nuclear receptors to DNA, discovery of steroid response element, cloning of the first nuclear receptor fragment, first determination a 3-D structure of a nuclear receptor (the DNA binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor), discovery of the first physiological ligand of a nuclear receptor (fatty acids for the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha), discovery of liver X receptor beta (LXRβ), discovery of estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) and unravelling of some of their functions. Gustafsson also is credited with 12 patents, more than 1,400 peer-reviewed publications and more than 70,000 citations.

Description The Foundation was created to build on the Oppenheimers' Brenthurst Initiative of August 2003. The Initiative was designed to instigate a debate in South Africa around policy strategies to achieve higher rates of economic expansion. Today the Foundation now has a wider African focus and aims to find ways to draw the investment needed for \\"continental regeneration and prosperity\\". The organization intends to make a worthwhile contribution to economic growth in Africa by creating an environment conducive to positive economic change in order to strengthen the importance of Africa in the global market. It works to set up government policy platforms for economic development through organizing high-level governmental dialogues, supporting economic and political research on topical and important issues, and disseminating practical policy advice to relevant actors. The organization has been described as a frontier of knowledge for strengthening Africa’s economic performance. The Foundation has been active in a range of roles in various countries across the continent, such as their involvement in a Presidential Advisory Committee on the Economy set up by former President Joyce Banda of Malawi., their collaboration with the Tony Elumelu Foundation of Nigeria to investigate enterprise and private sector development, and other government secondments and/or engagements in Rwanda, Liberia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Mali, Zambia, Swaziland, Botswana, Somaliland, Sudan, Ghana, Morocco, Somaliland and Zimbabwe. The Foundation also organizes regular policy study-tours for its African partners to a number of countries. These aim to expose African opinion-formers to development 'best practice'. These trips have included participation by officials up to the prime- ministerial level, and incorporated meetings with current and former heads of state. Countries visited in the past include: Vietnam (2007, 2009, 2011), Singapore (2008 and 2009), Cambodia (2011), Panama (2009), Colombia (2009 and 2014), Costa Rica (2009), El Salvador (2009) and Morocco (2008). People Advisory Board The Brenthurst Foundation Advisory Board comprises a number of eminent and notable government officials, academics, and business leaders. It is chaired by Olusegun Obasanjo, the former President of Nigeria. Other members of the Board include Jonathan Oppenheimer, Deputy Chair to Commission to the African Union Erastus Mwencha, President of the American Jewish University, USA Jeffrey Herbst, former Prime Minister of Mozambique Luísa Diogo, Former Prime Minister of Ethiopia Hailemariam Desalegn, Former President of Liberia and Nobel Laureate Ellen Johnson Sirleaf .

It was named the Centuriate Assembly as it originally divided Roman citizens into groups of one hundred men by classes. The centuries initially reflected military status, but were later based on the wealth of their members. The centuries gathered into the Centuriate Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The majority of votes in any century decided how that century voted. Each century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Century held. Once a majority of centuries voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.Taylor, 40 Only the Centuriate Assembly could declare war or elect the highest-ranking Roman magistrates: consuls, praetors and censors.Abbott, 257 The Centuriate Assembly could also pass a law that granted constitutional command authority, or \\"Imperium\\", to Consuls and Praetors (the lex de imperio or \\"Law on Imperium\\"), and Censorial powers to Censors (the lex de potestate censoria or \\"Law on Censorial Powers\\").Abbott, 257 In addition, the Centuriate Assembly served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases (in particular, cases involving perduellio), and ratified the results of a Census.Taylor, 3, 4 Since the Romans used a form of direct democracy, citizens, and not elected representatives, voted before each assembly. As such, the citizen-electors had no power, other than the power to cast a vote. Each assembly was presided over by a single Roman Magistrate, and as such, it was the presiding magistrate who made all decisions on matters of procedure and legality. Ultimately, the presiding magistrate's power over the assembly was nearly absolute. The only check on that power came in the form of vetoes handed down by other magistrates. Any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a tribune of the plebs, or by a higher-ranked magistrate (for example, a consul could veto a praetor). Assembly procedure In the Roman system of direct democracy, two primary types of assembly were used to vote on legislative, electoral, and judicial matters. The first was the Committee (comitia, literally \\"going together\\" or \\"meeting place\\").Lintott, 42 The Centuriate Assembly was a Committee. Committees were assemblies of all citizens,Abbott, 251 and were used for official purposes, such as for the enactment of laws. Acts of a Committee applied to all of the members of that Committee. The second type of assembly was the Council (concilium), which was a forum where specific groups of citizens met for official purposes.Abbott, 251 In contrast, the Convention (conventio, literally \\"coming together\\") was an unofficial forum for communication. Conventions were simply forums where Romans met for specific unofficial purposes, such as, for example, to hear a political speech.Lintott, 42 Private citizens who did not hold political office could only speak before a Convention, and not before a Committee or a Council.Abbott, 252 Conventions were simply meetings, and no legal or legislative decisions could be made in one. Voters always assembled first into Conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting, and then into Committees or Councils to actually vote.Taylor, 2 A notice always had to be given several days before the assembly was to actually vote. For elections, at least three market-days (often more than seventeen actual days) had to pass between the announcement of the election, and the actual election. During this time period (the trinundinum), the candidates interacted with the electorate, and no legislation could be proposed or voted upon. In 98 BC, a law was passed (the lex Caecilia Didia) which required a similar three market-day interval to pass between the proposal of a law and the vote on that law.Lintott, 44 During criminal trials, the assembly's presiding magistrate had to give a notice (diem dicere) to the accused person on the first day of the investigation (anquisito). At the end of each day, the magistrate had to give another notice to the accused person (diem prodicere), which informed him of the status of the investigation. After the investigation was complete, a three market-day interval had to elapse before a final vote could be taken with respect to conviction or acquittal.Lintott, 44-45 Only one assembly could operate at any given point in time, and any session already underway could be dissolved if a magistrate \\"called away\\" (avocare) the electors.Lintott, 44 In addition to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. They were available to help resolve procedural disputes, and to provide a mechanism through which electors could appeal decisions of the presiding magistrate.Taylor, 63 There were also religious officials (known as Augurs) either in attendance or on-call, who would be available to help interpret any signs from the Gods (omens), since the Romans believed that their gods let their approval or disapproval with proposed actions be known.Taylor, 63 In addition, a preliminary search for omens (auspices) was conducted by the presiding magistrate the night before any meeting.Taylor, 7 On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. In 162, the presiding magistrate, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, even cancelled the elections of the consuls Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum and Gaius Marcius Figulus because he found he had not conducted the auspices correctly; the consuls were forced to abdicate and new elections were organised.Plutarch, Marcellus, 5.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 441, 442. On the day of the vote, the electors first assembled into their Conventions for debate and campaigning.Taylor, 2 In the Conventions, the electors were not sorted into their respective centuries. Speeches from private citizens were only heard if the issue to be voted upon was a legislative or judicial matter, and even then, only if the citizen received permission from the presiding magistrate.Lintott, 45 If the purpose of the ultimate vote was for an election, no speeches from private citizens were heard, and instead, the candidates for office used the Convention to campaign.Taylor, 16 During the Convention, the bill to be voted upon was read to the assembly by an officer known as a \\"Herald\\". A tribune of the plebs could use his veto against pending legislation up until this point, but not after.Lintott, 46 The electors were then told to break up the Convention (\\"depart to your separate groups\\", or discedite, quirites), and assemble into their formal century. The electors assembled behind a fenced off areaTaylor, 2 and voted by placing a pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar.Lintott, 46-47 The baskets (cistae) that held the votes were watched by specific officers (the custodes), who then counted the ballots, and reported the results to the presiding magistrate. The majority of votes in any century decided how that century voted.Taylor, 40 If the process was not complete by nightfall, the electors were dismissed without having reached a decision, and the process had to begin again the next day.Lintott, 48 Chart Showing the Checks and Balances of the Constitution of the Roman Republic Presiding magistrate and elections The presiding magistrate sat on a special chair (the \\"curule chair\\"), wore a purple-bordered toga, and was accompanied by bodyguards called lictors. Each lictor carried the symbol of state power, the fasces, which was a bundle of white birch rods, tied together with a red leather ribbon into a cylinder, and with a blade on the side, projecting from the bundle. While the voters in this assembly wore white undecorated togas and were unarmed, they were still soldiers, and as such they could not meet inside of the physical boundary of the city of Rome (the pomerium). Because of this, as well as the large size of the assembly (as many as 373 centuries), the assembly often met on the Field of Mars (Latin: Campus Martius), which was a large field located right outside of the city wall.Taylor, 85 The president of the Centuriate Assembly was usually a Consul (although sometimes a Praetor). Only Consuls (the highest-ranking of all Roman Magistrates) could preside over the Centuriate Assembly during elections because the higher-ranking Consuls were always elected together with the lower-ranking Praetors. Consuls and Praetors were usually elected in July, and took office in January. Two Consuls, and at least six Praetors, were elected each year for an annual term that began in January and ended in December. In contrast, two Censors were elected every five years on average. Once every five years, after the new Consuls for the year took office, they presided over the Centuriate Assembly as it elected the two Censors. Servian organization (509-241 BC) The Centuriate Assembly was supposedly founded by the legendary Roman King Servius Tullius, less than a century before the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 BC. As such, the original design of the Centuriate Assembly was known as the \\"Servian organization\\". Under this organization, the assembly was supposedly designed to mirror the Roman army during the time of the Roman Kingdom, with a division such that the citizen-soldiers had the responsibility of electing the consuls and praetors, and therefore, their leaders. The Roman army was based on units called centuries, which were comparable to Companies in a modern army. While Centuries in the Roman army always consisted of about one hundred soldiers, Centuries in the Centuriate Assembly usually did not. This was because the property qualifications for membership in a voting century did not change over time, as property qualifications for membership in a military century did. Soldiers in the Roman army were classified on the basis of the amount of property that they owned, and as such, soldiers with more property outranked soldiers with less property. Since the wealthy soldiers were divided into more centuries in the early Roman army, with a greater military burden, the wealthy soldiers were also divided into more centuries in the Centuriate Assembly. Thus, the wealthy soldiers, who were fewer in number and had more to lose, had a greater overall influence. The 193 centuries in the assembly under the Servian Organization were each divided into one of three different grades: the officer class (the cavalry or equites), the enlisted class (infantry or pedites) and the miscellaneous class (mostly unarmed adjuncts).Taylor, 85 The officer class was grouped into eighteen centuries, six of which (the sex suffragia) were composed exclusively of Patricians.Taylor, 85 The enlisted class was grouped into 170 centuries. Most enlisted individuals (those aged seventeen to forty- six) were grouped into eighty-five centuries of \\"junior soldiers\\" (iuniores or \\"young men\\"). The relatively limited number of enlisted soldiers who were aged forty-six to sixty were grouped into eighty-five centuries of \\"senior soldiers\\" (seniores or \\"old men\\").Taylor, 86 The result of this arrangement was that the votes of the older soldiers carried more weight than did the votes of the numerically greater younger soldiers. According to Cicero, the Consul of 63 BC, this design was intentional so that the decisions of the assembly were more in line with the will of the more experienced soldiers who arguably had more to lose. The 170 centuries of enlisted soldiers were divided into five classes, each with a separate property requirement: The first class consisted of soldiers with heavy armor, the lower classes had successively less armor, and the soldiers of the fifth class had nothing more than slings and stones. Each of the five property classes were divided equally between centuries of younger soldiers and centuries of older soldiers. The first class of enlisted soldiers consisted of eighty centuries, classes two through four consisted of twenty centuries each, and class five consisted of thirty centuries.Taylor, 87 The unarmed soldiers were divided into the final five centuries: four of these centuries were composed of artisans and musicians (such as trumpeters and horn blowers), while the fifth century (the proletarii) consisted of people with little or no property.Abbott, 21 During a vote, all of the centuries of one class had to vote before the centuries of the next lower class could vote. The seven classes voted by order of seniority: first the officer class, then the first enlisted class, then the second enlisted class, then the third enlisted class, then the fourth enlisted class, then the fifth enlisted class, and then finally the unarmed centuries. When a measure received a majority of the vote, the voting ended, and as such, many lower ranking centuries rarely if ever had a chance to actually vote. Reorganization (241 BC- 27 BC) Under the Servian Organization, the assembly was so aristocratic that the officer class and the first class of enlisted soldiers controlled enough centuries for an outright majority. In 241 BC, this assembly was reorganized by the Censors Marcus Fabius Buteo and Gaius Aurelius Cotta, in order to give more weight to the lower ranking centuries, and thus make the assembly less aristocratic.Abbott, 75 Under the old system, there were a total of 193 centuries, while under the new system, there were a total of 373 centuries. Under the new system, the thirty-five Tribes were each divided into ten centuries:Abbott, 74 five of older soldiers, and five of younger soldiers. Of each of these five centuries, one was assigned to one of the five property classes. Therefore, each Tribe had two centuries (one of older soldiers and one of younger soldiers) allocated to each of the five property classes. In addition, the property requirements for each of the five classes were probably raised. In total, this resulted in 350 centuries of enlisted soldiers. The same eighteen centuries of officers, and the same five centuries of unarmed soldiers, were also included in the redesign.Abbott, 75 Now, majorities usually could not be reached until the third class of enlisted centuries had begun voting. Sulla, who attempted to change the power of the Assemblies Since the lowest ranking century in the Centuriate Assembly, the fifth unarmed century (the proletarii), was always the last century to vote, it never had any real influence on elections, and as such, it was so poorly regarded that it was all but ignored during the Census. In 107 BC, in response to high unemployment and a severe manpower shortage in the army, the general and Consul Gaius Marius reformed the organization of the army, and allowed individuals with no property to enlist. As a consequence of these reforms, this fifth unarmed century came to encompass almost the entire Roman army.Taylor, 86 This mass disenfranchisement of most of the soldiers in the army played an important role in the chaos that led to the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC. During his dictatorship from 82 BC until 80 BC, Lucius Cornelius Sulla restored the old Servian organization to this assembly. This reform was one in a slate of constitutional reforms enacted by Sulla as a consequence of the recent Civil War between his supporters and those of the former Consul Gaius Marius. His reforms were intended to reassert aristocratic control over the constitution, and thus prevent the emergence of another Marius. Sulla died in 78 BC, and in 70 BC, the Consuls Pompey Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus repealed Sulla's constitutional reforms, including his restoration of the Servian organization to this assembly. They restored the less aristocratic organization (from 241 BC by the Censors Marcus Fabius Buteo and Gaius Aurelius Cotta). The organization of the Centuriate Assembly was not changed again until its powers were all transferred to the Roman Senate by the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, after the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC.

It was part of the 2nd New Zealand Division, which had already seen action in the Battle of Greece, the Battle of Crete and in the North African Campaign, having a leading part in the Second Battle of El Alamein. The brigade arrived in Italy in October 1943 and took part in a number of battles over the course of a sixteen-month campaign in Italy. They were equipped with Sherman and Stuart tanks, Lynx scout cars and a variety of other vehicles. The 4th Armoured Brigade was officially disbanded, after the war, in December 1945. It was reactivated briefly in the 1950s. History=Formation The 4th New Zealand Armoured Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Lindsay Inglis, came into being on 5 October 1942 after the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade was converted into an armoured brigade.See http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=6413 =Uhi. Upon formation the 4th New Zealand Armoured Brigade was initially composed only of one regiment, the 19th Armoured Regiment. By the time it deployed to Italy in October 1943, the brigade included the 18th and 20th armoured regiments, and the 22nd Motorised Battalion. The armoured regiments were organized along British lines, albeit with fewer tanks than their British counterparts. A New Zealand armoured regiment consisted of 52 Sherman tanks. These composed a Regimental HQ troop of four tanks and three squadrons of 16 tanks. In addition the regiment contained a Recce Troop equipped with Stuart V light tanks in both turreted and turret less configurations and an Intercommunication troop equipped with Lynx light scout cars. Each Squadron consisted of a Squadron Headquarters with four tanks and four troops each of three tanks.

The Sangro Front, 1943. In 1944 they were transferred to U.S. Fifth Army on the Italian western coast. The New Zealand Division was joined by the 4th Indian Division and the British 78th Division, and together with units of the U.S. 1st Armored Division formed the New Zealand Corps and was tasked with the capture of the town of Cassino, its skyline dominated by a 13th Century Monastery. During this period the 4th New Zealand Armoured Brigade was tasked with supporting the infantry. Individual squadrons were employed in a fire support role, often being used as makeshift artillery. The 20th Armoured Regiment participated in a flanking attack, approaching the Monastery on a specially constructed road from behind. Surprise was achieved, but insufficient infantry reserves to press the initiative saw the German defenders regain the upper hand and the tanks fell back. Soldiers of the 18th Armoured Regiment, with a Sherman ready to cross the Po River in Italy. In March tanks from the 19th Armoured Regiment entered the town proper to support members of the 28th Māori Battalion in the bitter house to house fighting, using their 75mm guns to dig the defenders out of strong points. The degree of rubble clogging the streets made progress slow and by the end of the month when relieved by the 20th Armoured Regiment the Shermans had reverted to the role of static fire support. This continued for the next two months, with the tanks able to provide little more than morale support to the infantry until the monastery finally fell to Polish forces on 19 May 1944. In August the 18th Armoured Regiment during an attack on Castelle, were employed as gun tows for 6pdr and 17pdr guns, the guns crews being carried as tank riders. The Brigade's next major engagement was to assist in the British Eighth Army’s attack on the Adriatic end of the Gothic Line in September 1944. The final campaign began on 9 April 1945 with some New Zealand armoured units again being used as artillery support. A number of rivers blocked the advance and these were progressively assaulted by infantry and then in turn the armour moved up to support as bridges were constructed. By this point the German troops had begun surrendering in large numbers. With the final rivers behind them the bulk of the New Zealand armoured brigade raced to the city of Trieste where they accepted the surrender of the German garrison. Members of Josip Broz Tito’s Yugoslav partisan army had also occupied the city and the presence of the New Zealanders in an area the Yugoslavs considered their spoils of war was not welcome. Tensions remained high, at one point escalating to a face off between 25 Yugoslav T-34s, which had entered the city, and the 19th Armoured Regiment. After the end of hostilities in Europe, the 4th New Zealand Armoured Brigade remained as a garrison force in Trieste for a month before surrendering most of their equipment to a British depot. Nevertheless, the Brigade retained approximately 100 vehicles to form the core of an armoured force for future deployment to the Pacific theatre to conduct operations against the Japanese. However, with the war in the Pacific also drawing to a close these tanks were later retired and on 2 December 1945 the 4th New Zealand Armoured Brigade was officially disbanded. Reactivation The brigade was reformed in April 1953 to supervise the four Territorial Force armoured regiments of the New Zealand Division, which was designated for a war role against a Soviet invasion of the Middle East. Headquarters was located at Linton Military Camp in what was then the Central Military District.Damien Marc Fenton, 'A False Sense of Security: The Force Structure of the New Zealand Army 1946-1978,' Centre for Strategic Studies:New Zealand, 1998, 46, 62. The 2nd and 3rd Armoured Regiments were placed in suspended animation, effectively disbanded, in 1956. However, in 1958 the 2nd Armoured Regiment was reactivated on 15 September 1958 as a Regular Force unit. It was then redesignated Queen Alexandra's Armoured Regiment and then The Queen Alexandra's Regiment RNZAC on 31 August 1959.Marc Fenton, 1998, p.70-71 In 1956, the Divisional Regiment, RNZAC, was redesignated 4th Armoured Regiment.

In these early years his career was basically based on making fun. It became clear that he was talented in sprinting as well as at the long jump even though his opponents at that age were quite a bit larger than him. When he was sixteen he started to become more serious in developing his career and he started training more frequently. As a second year B-junior in 2001 he won his first medals at the national championships: silver at the 60m indoor and bronze at the 100m outdoor. His next goal was to achieve a time under 11 seconds over 100 metres. He succeeded straight away with 10.99, but in his second attempt he already run 10.82 seconds. Nonetheless he was unable to achieve the limit for the World Junior Championships in Jamaica that was set at 10.74 seconds. Only five days after the deadline he improved his personal best to 10.70, but it was too late to start in Jamaica. In his last year as a junior Heisen did manage to qualify for the 2003 European Junior Championships in Tampere. He participated in the 100m (where he reached the semi final) and the 4 × 100 m relay (the team reached the final, but due to an exchanging error between Heisen and Michael Mathew they did not finish). The following year Heisen participated on senior level, but had a hard time adjusting to the higher level. He reached the finals at the national championships, however he was unable to come close to the podium. He was added to the Dutch Olympic Team selection and learned a lot from the more experienced athletes, specially those that qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2005 he suffered with an injury during the start of the year, but he managed to win his first senior medals. He won a silver medal at the 60m indoor and a bronze at the 100m outdoor. He missed out on qualification for the under-23 European Championships and decided to run some international races in Helsinki and Stockholm. His personal best time over 100 metres was improved to 10.52 at the end of 2005. In 2006 he won the bronze medal during the 60 metres at the Dutch Indoor Championships in Ghent, but apart from that no notable results were achieved. Also in 2007 he did not perform at his best, although he did manage to beat his personal best at the 100 metres to 10.49. Unexpectedly because of his results in the past two years his start in 2008 was very successful. Heisen qualified himself for the World Indoor Championships in Valencia due to a 6.66 at the 60 metres indoor during an international race in Luxembourg. In Valencia he achieved 6.77 to reach the semi final in which his 6.71 was not enough to qualify for the final and ended up in 16th position overall. Heisen made his way into the Dutch 4 x 100 metres relay team together with team mates Caimin Douglas, Patrick van Luijk, Guus Hoogmoed, Gregory Sedoc and Virgil Spier. Their aim was to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics and initially they finished in 17th position during the qualification process while only the first 16 teams would qualify. Due to the cancellation of the Australian team they were allowed to start in Beijing.Atleet Caimin Douglas toch naar Peking, antilliaans.caribiana.nl, ret: Aug 3, 2008 In their qualification heat Heisen, Hoogmoed, Van Luijk and Douglas placed third in behind Trinidad and Tobago and Japan, but in front of Brazil. Their time of 38.87 was the fifth fastest out of all sixteen participating nations in the first round and they qualified for the final. In the final, the second baton change between Hoogmoed and Van Luijk failed, resulting in a slow time. They still finished the race to place seventh, before the disqualified Chinese team.

It consists of a small tube no larger than a medical tablet bottle, made from plastic, glass or some other such material. At the bottom end of the tube, a certain volume of mercury is placed, while at the cap end are wired two live electrical contacts linked to a battery and bomb.Cutterbuck (1994) p. 52 This apparatus is then fixed lengthwise to the target vehicle; most usually, the tube is attached to the underside, below the driver or passenger's seat (depending on the desired target and the strength and quantity of the detonators) or within the mudguards. The function of the fuze is such that when it is tilted or moved, the mercury – a liquid metal – will slide down the tube and close the electrical circuit wired to the bomb. Once the circuit is closed, the electric current will then be able to bridge the previously open gap and activate the bomb presumably concealed in another part of the vehicle. Such a tilting of the tilt fuze will likely occur over the regular bumps and jerks of the vehicle driving, ascension up the slope of a hill, or the depression of the brake or acceleration pedals, depending on the placement of the tube. Due to the volatility in the conduction of the operation, bombers often take precautionary measures to prevent accidental tilting of the fuze while they are setting up. These often include a timer incorporated with the electric current; the bomber may set a certain time period before the contacts become live, therefore ensuring that the bomb cannot be activated until the bomber is well clear of the area. Tilt fuzes sometimes meet use with the anti-handling devices incorporated into munitions such as the VS-50 mine. The Luftwaffe in World War II are known to have made use of variants of the tilt fuze in their bomb fuzes. Tilt fuzes have been used extensively by the Irish Republican Army and Irish National Liberation Army since 1979.Clutterbuck (1990), p.181  Notes  References   Category:Improvised explosive devices Category:Car bombs ","title":"Tilt fuze"},{"id":"18712201","text":"Mother Lettice Mary Tredway, C.R.L., (1595 – October 1677), courtesy title Lady Tredway, was an English canoness regular and abbess who founded a monastery for the English members of her Order in 17th-century Europe. Life In July 1616, Tredway entered the novitiate of the Canonesses Regular of the Lateran at their Priory of Notre-Dame-de-Beaulieu in the village of Sin-le-Noble, near Douai, in the County of Flanders, which had been established in the 13th century as a hostel for travellers and the sick. She was probably educated there, and in October 1617, made her solemn profession of vows as a member of the community. In 1631 she and Miles Pinkney, better known as Father Carre, a priest of the English College at Douai, conceived the project of opening a monastery of canonesses for English subjects only at Douai. The idea was approved by the Catholic authorities at home and abroad, and in 1634 it was decided to open this English priory at Paris. Bishop Richard Smith, who was charged with the spiritual care of the Catholics of Great Britain, then in exile in Paris, helped them generously and may be counted a co-founder. He blessed Lady Tredway as abbess, and the Priory of Notre-Dame-de-Sion was permanently established on the Rue des Fosses in 1639. Carre and Tredway were also practically the founders of the Seminary of St. Gregory (now Downside Abbey) for training priests for the English mission. A pension for English ladies and a school were attached to the new monastery, of which Tredway held the office of abbess till 1675, when illness compelled her to resign. After her death the superiors of the priory held the title of prioress, as is customary for communities of Augustinian canonesses. The priory which Tredway established continued in operation, along with the school attached to it, until the French Revolution, when the English canonesses were finally forced to flee. They returned to their homeland, where they found that they were able to live out their life as a religious community. Eventually the community established itself as St Augustine's Priory, Ealing. Family Mother Mary was the daughter of Sir Walter Tredway, of Buckley Park in Northamptonshire; her mother was Elizabeth Weyman.

In the drier areas of Nicaragua, it can be found in gallery forests as well as forests that are seasonally dry, but then never far from sources of water. This species is hardly ever encountered outside of old growth forest. Taxonomy Campbell and Lamar (2004) also recognize Lachesis acrochorda (García, 1896), which McDiarmid et al. (1999) treat as a synonym of L. stenophrys. The Reptile Database follows the former position. ReferencesFurther reading * Cope, E.D. 1876. On the Batrachia and Reptilia of Costa Rica.

According to Chinese government sources, it was a terrorist attack perpetrated by two men with suspected ties to the Uyghur separatist movement. The men reportedly drove a truck into a group of approximately 70 jogging police officers, and proceeded to attack them with grenades and machetes, resulting in the death of sixteen officers. Foreign tourists who witnessed the scene provided a divergent account of events, saying that the attackers appeared to be machete- wielding paramilitary officers. Background The Uyghurs are the largest ethnic group in ethnically diverse Xinjiang, making up just over 45% of the population. The Uyghur movement's use of militant separatism has resulted in it being described as a potentially dangerous movement. In particular, the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) is a proscribed terrorist organisation according to classification by the United Nations. Among other incidents, East Turkestan independence movement organisations have claimed responsibility for the 2008 Kunming bus bombings; however, China denied that the group was responsible. The Uyghur Human Rights project alleges that China often exaggerates these threats to justify repression of the Uyghur people. Details Two attackers were involved in the incident near the western city of Kashgar. The Xinhua News Agency said the attack happened at about 08:00 (00:00 GMT). One of the men drove a dump truck into a group of border patrol police officers as they were jogging on a street. The attacker then got out of the truck and started attacking other officers with homemade explosives. The explosives went off prematurely and blew off one of his arms. The other attacker threw improvised explosive devices at a nearby police office. He then went into the building with a knife, but was subdued by police officers inside the complex. Both perpetrators were captured during the raid. Fourteen policemen died at the scene and two died on the way to hospital; another 16 policemen were hurt, Xinhua state news agency reported. The attackers were later identified as males, taxi driver Kurbanjan Hemit (28), and vegetable vendor Abdurahman Azat (33). They are members of the Uyghur ethnic group, and it was suspected that the attack was a terrorist action by Eastern Turkistan separatists. The news agency Xinhua claimed in their English-language version that the incident was a terrorist attack; on the other side, in their Chinese- language version, the incident was only labeled as a violent crime. Police investigators later claimed that they had found documents calling for a holy war, a homemade firearm, and nine explosives. Police also claimed the design of these explosives was very similar to the explosives made by the ETIM when Chinese police raided their training facility in January 2007. Xinjiang's regional public security department also claimed that it had received intelligence that the East Turkestan independence movement planned to carry out terrorist attacks during the week before the opening ceremonies of the Olympic games. This incident happened four days before the Beijing Olympics, after repeated warnings in recent months from the Chinese government that militants from the restive Xinjiang region were planning to stage attacks to disrupt the Games. In September 2008, the New York Times reported that three tourists who witnessed the events disputed central details of the official story. According to the eyewitnesses, no explosions were heard and the attackers appeared to be machete-wielding police officers attacking other uniformed men. Reactions The exiled Uyghur Muslims leader and human rights activist Rebiya Kadeer condemned the reported attack and stated that \\"China is using the 2008 Olympics as an opportunity to further demonise the Uighur people's legitimate and peaceful struggle and justify its heavy-handed repression in the region.\\" The Chinese government reacted with a clampdown in Kashgar and Xinjiang, increasing security checks and restricting independent news coverage. Detention of media On the night of 4 August, a Tokyo Shimbun cameraman and a Japanese TV reporter, along with two Hong Kong reporters making reports near the police post were detained by security. The two Hong Kong reporters were not harmed; however, the Japanese reporters were beaten and punched. All four were released after two hours of detention. The Japanese government protested the Chinese actions, although it has made no formal statement as there was no confirmation. Chinese officials and police in Kashgar have apologised for the incident, but accused the two men of breaking rules.

They are sometimes called as tube- forming spittle-bugs as the nymphs form a calcareous tube within which they live. These bugs are mainly found in the Old World tropics. The adults of many genera have a long, free and spine-like process originating at the scutellum and thus superficially similar to the tree-hoppers, Membracidae. Its tegmen or forewing, like typical bugs of the suborder Heteroptera, always has a distinct, membranous apical area. Like other cercopoids, these are xylem-sap feeders. The nymph extracts calcium from the xylem fluid and constructs a calcareous tube from Malphigian gland secretions on some woody dicotyledons and immerses itself in a rather clear fluid excretion inside the tube. The tube strongly resembles the shell of certain serpulid sea worms or helicoid land snails and contain no less than 75% calcium carbonate. This habit is quite uncommon in the class Insecta and markedly different from that of typical cercopoids or spittlebugs, which make and live in a froth mass either below or above ground. Machaerotids produce foam only when they emerge from the tube to moult. There are about 115 species in 31 genera placed in 4 tribes. The majority of species are found in Southeast Asia with a small number for Africa. They were traditionally separated into two subfamilies Machaerotinae which have the scutellar spine and Enderleiniinae which lack it. A third family, also lacking the spine, Apomachaerotinae, was introduced in 2014. The scutellum has a \\"tail\\" or appears raised towards the posterior end.

Some sources assert that she received a doctorate in canon law in Avignon in 1608. In 1941, Sylvanus Morley traced this to an 1859 misreading by of 17th-century Latin documents.Griswold (January 1941) pp. 140, 148–149 and cited others stating that, while her father wished for her to obtain a doctorate, she refused, regarding it as incompatible with her status as a nun.Griswold (July 1941) p.4 01 doc.5 and p.402 \\"Two facts are now very clear: Juliana Morell never taught in Paris, and she never received the doctor's degree in Avignon.\\" Biography Morella was born at Barcelona and was left motherless when very young; her first training was received from the Dominican nuns at Barcelona. At the age of four she began Latin, Greek, and Hebrew at home under competent teachers. When not yet seven years old, she wrote a Latin letter to her father who was away. Accused of taking part in a murder, the father fled to Lyon with his daughter, then eight years old. At Lyon Juliana continued her studies, devoting nine hours daily to rhetoric, dialectics, ethics, and music. At the age of 12 she defended in public her theses in ethics and dialectics summa cum laude. She then applied herself to physics, metaphysics and canon and civil law. Her father, who had meanwhile settled at Avignon, wanted his daughter to obtain a law doctorate. This was gained in 1608, when she publicly maintained her law theses at the papal palace of the vice-legate before a distinguished audience, among whom was the Princesse de Condé. It is not clear what body granted her the degree. According to some sources, Morell was the first woman to receive a university degree, but the circumstances are unclear. Juliana Morell \\"defended theses\\" in 1606 or 1607 in Lyon or maybe Avignon, although claims that she received a doctorate in canon law in 1608 have been discredited. The first woman to receive a doctorate degree in the modern era was Elena Cornaro Piscopia in 1678 at the University of Padua. Disregarding wealth and an advantageous offer of marriage, she entered during the same year the convent of Sainte-Praxède at Avignon. In 1609 she received the habit of the order, and on 20 June 1610 took the vows. On three occasions she was named prioress. For two years before her end she was in great bodily suffering and her death agony lasted five days; she died in 1653 at Avignon. In a laudatory poem Lope de Vega speaks of her \\"as the fourth of the Graces and the tenth Muse\\" and says \\"that she was an angel who publicly taught all the sciences from the professorial chairs and in schools\\". Works Morell left a number of religious writings: *A translation of the \\"Vita Spiritualis\\" of Vincent Ferrer, with comments and notes to the various chapters (Lyons, 1617; Paris, 1619); *Exercices spirituels sur l'éternité (1637); *French translation of the Rule of St. Augustine with addition of various explanations and observations for the purpose of instruction (Avigon, 1680); *History of the reform of the convent of St. Praxedis, with lives of some pious sisters, in manuscript; *Latin and French poems, some printed and some in manuscript.

Soloveitchik, first published in the summer 1965 issue of Tradition, and published in a newly revised edition in 2011 by Koren Publishers Jerusalem. In The Lonely Man of Faith Soloveitchik reads the first two chapters of Book of Genesis as offering two images of Adam which are, in many ways, at odds with one another. The first Adam, or \\"majestic man,\\" employs his creative faculties in order to master his environment as mandated by God; the second image of Adam is a distinctly different contractual man who surrenders himself to the will of God. Soloveitchik describes how the man of faith must integrate both of these ideas as he seeks to follow God's will. In the first chapter, Adam I is created together with Eve and they are given the mandate to subdue nature, master the cosmos, and transform the world \\"into a domain for their power and sovereignty.\\" Adam I is majestic man who approaches the world and relationships—even with the divine—in functional, pragmatic terms. Adam I, created in the image of God, fulfills this apparently \\"secular\\" mandate by conquering the universe, imposing his knowledge, technology, and cultural institutions upon the world. The human capacity for relationship, as depicted in Genesis 1, is utilitarian, following both God's mandate and our own worldly need to develop the world for ourselves and our continuing existence. Soloveitchik identifies the second image of Adam in chapter two of Genesis. Whereas Adam I was mandated to subdue the garden, Adam II is the contractual man,\\" the keeper of the garden who tills and preserves it. This image is introduced by the words, \\"It is not good for man to be alone\\" - and through God's intervention and Adam's sacrifice (of a metaphoric rib) he gains companionship and the relief of his existential loneliness - unlike Adam I, this covenantal community requires the participation of the Divine. In the second chapter of God's creation, it is not enough for man to simply be created in his image and given a fiefdom. Adam II is \\"the lonely man of faith,\\" the \\"redemptive Adam,\\" bringing a \\"redemptive interpretation to the meaning of existence\\". Soloveitchik does not declare one image of Adam to be the right one, but rather identifies the struggle we must undergo as human beings in this existence, given by God, that is both spiritual and material, mystical and scientific, redemptive yet empowered.

He was a court poet of Udaya Varma (1446-1475) and the author of Krishnagatha, a poem which is considered a landmark in the development of Malayalam literature. Cherusseri Namboothiri is believed to have lived between 1375 and 1475 CE. He was born in Kaanathoor village in Kolathunadu or Kolaththiri Desam (now Kannur district, Kerala). Several scholars like P. K. Narayana Pillai and P. Govinda Pillai hold the view that Cherusseri was the name of the Namboothiri's ancestral house (Illam). However, according to T. K. Balakrishnan Nair, there were 12 cheris in Kolathnadu and the smallest of them was called Cheru-Cheri (Cheru- small; Cheri-an extent of a place) which has finally taken the form of Cherusseri. There aren't many details recorded in history about the life of this poet. There is some dispute about the author's name and his identity. Some scholars are of opinion that he was the same as the Punam Namboothiri of the Champu literature. The difference between the style of Krishna Gatha and that of any of the Champus however refutes this argument. A few lines in the opening stanzas of Krishna Gatha clarify that he was a court poet in the palace of the king Udaya Varma, who then ruled Kolathunadu: \\"Paalaazhi maaruthan paalichchu porunna Kolathu Nathan Udayavarman Aajnaye cholliyaal ajnanaayullava njaan Praajnaayingane bhaavichchappol\\" (When the king who rules the Kolath dhesam commands, the ignorant me pretend to be a talented one). Cherusseri's living period has been decided based on the historical record of King Udayavarman's period of reign. His story about Akruran visiting Ambadi to meet kannan is very famous. His various thoughts Are Portrayed in this story. Krishna Gatha is a long poem of epical dimensions written at the behest of Udaya Varma. It is the first Maha Kavya in Malayalam. Udaya Varma rewarded him with the title Veerasrinkhala and other honors. Cherusseri is the originator of the Gatha style of poetry in Malayalam. Krishna Gatha is the detailed description of the boyhood pranks of Lord Krishna based on the 10th canto of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, an early Puranic text. Cherusseri's importance lies in his clear inclination towards native tongue, by which his poetry became popular among the people of Kerala. With the writing of Krishna Gatha, the validity of the use of spoken Malayalam for literary purposes received its ultimate justification. Unlike the language of Cheeraman's Ramacharitam and the works of the Niranam poets, the language of Krishna Gatha marks the culmination of a stage of evolution. This work has been respected by the people of Kerala similar to Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan's Adhyathmaramayanam (Ezhuthachan is known as the father of modern Malayalam literature). The legend is that Cherusseri was inspired by a lullaby and followed the same metrical pattern for the composition of Krishna Gatha. It is written in a melodious metre known as manjari. Krishna Gatha is used in India for daily recitation as an act of worship of Krishna during the Malayalam month Chingam (August - September) by devout Malayali Hindus. The sonorous poetry Krishna Gatha depicts the exploits of Lord Krishna. It is in Krishna Gatha that we see a diction which is similar to that of the present day. The theme deals with the story of Lord Krishna. The sweet and tender aspects of maternal love are wonderfully portrayed in this work. As there are lengthy beautiful descriptions with lavish use of adjectives throughout the poetical work, the composition is quite interesting and enjoyable. Feelings of passion, devotion, humor, and warmth are all discovered at a superior level, singly in a natural style and with equal measure. Other than Krishna Gaatha, Bhaaratha Gaatha is also considered to be Cherusseri's composition.

FE.6:1 to 4-1973 This carved lacquerware table in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London is from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). It is unique in shape and decoration and is one of the most important objects from the period. It is one of the few surviving examples in the world of a major piece of furniture produced in the 'Orchard Workshop', the Imperial lacquer workshop set up in the early Ming period and situated to the north-west of the 'Forbidden City' compound in Peking (now Beijing).Jackson; Clunas, 107 By at least the Ming dynasty carved lacquer was being used all over the visible surfaces of pieces of furniture, a dauntingly expensive proposition. One of the best known pieces is this table, with three drawers, whose top has a typical imperial Ming design with a central dragon and phoenix, symbolizing the emperor and empress respectively; the pair also appear on the drawer-fronts. The table-top measures 119.5 cm by 84.5 cm and the table is 79.2 cm high. It was produced between 1425–1436 in the \\"Orchard Factory\\", and is the only piece of its size to survive from their production, the best period of Ming workmanship. As with many other pieces, the ground of the table-top relief was originally a yellow that contrasted with the red of the upper layers, but has now faded to a dark colour.Clunas, 107; Watt and Ford, 86; \\"Summary\\" and \\"More information\\" on the V&A; page on the table (use the tabs) The legs and edges of the top are carved with the \\"Flowers of the Four Seasons\\". The insides of the drawers are in plain red lacquer, and the outsides and underside of the table in black lacquer.Clunas, 107 The table bears the mark of the reign of the Xuande Emperor (1426–1435) and was probably made to stand in an Imperial Palace. An Imperial provenance is also suggested by the five-clawed dragons carved on the surface,Jackson each of which has been mutilated by the removal of one claw on each foot, as was often done when pieces left imperial ownership. The five-clawed dragon was only allowed to be used by the emperor, with very severe penalties for abuse, but imperial pieces were sometimes given as gifts, or pilfered by the court eunuchs to be sold at a notorious market outside the northern gate of the Forbidden City. The table top In the Ming period the dragon became a key imperial symbol, very often appearing on lacquer from the imperial workshops for the use of the court, or made to be given by the emperor.Watt and Ford, 31-32 Initially the dragon's head was seen in the traditional profile, as here, but in the middle of the 15th century the \\"frontal\\" dragon, seen looking out full-face at the viewer, was introduced and soon became the norm in lacquer as in other media.Watt and Ford, 104 Detail of a drawer The table was lent to the British Museum's 2014 exhibition Ming, 50 years that changed China.Clunas, 107 NotesReferences * *Clunas, Craig and Harrison-Hall, Jessica, Ming: 50 years that changed China, 2014, British Museum Press, *Watt, James C.

The mill was working until 1911, in which year the sails and windshaft were removed. The mill was used as a scout hut in the 1930s and was little more than a shell in the 1950s. In 1957, a new cap was fitted and the mill converted to residential use. Description Debden Windmill is a four storey tower mill. When working it carried a conical cap with a gallery, winded by a fantail. The windshaft was cast iron and carried four double Patent sails which rotated clockwise. The Brake wheel was wood, driving a cast iron Wallower carried on a wooden Upright Shaft. The wooden Great Spur Wheel drove three pairs of millstones.

Anthony George \\"Andy\\" Sannella (March 11, 1900 – December 10, 1962) was an American musician and bandleader. Andy Sannella was born in Brooklyn, NY.\\"Flying Radio Star Travels by Airplane for Broadcasts.\\" Greensboro (NC) Daily News, July 24, 1930, p. 17. His father Anthony and mother Lucia\\"Mrs. Lucia Sannella.\\" Brooklyn (NY) Daily Eagle, November 24, 1938, p. 11. were both Italian immigrants. Sannella was a multi- instrumentalist; according to jazz historian John Chilton he played violin, piano, organ, clarinet, alto saxophone, guitar (preferably steel guitar), banjo and vibraphone. Occasionally he also appeared as a singer. Early career with Ray Miller and other bandleaders Sannella began his musical studies on guitar and violin at the age of ten. When he was fourteen, his father died; several years later, Andy decided to leave school and join the military.\\"Folks Behind the Microphone.\\" (Washington, DC) Evening Star, June 25, 1931, p. C 4. He was turned down at first because he was underage, but was finally able to join the Navy.\\"Flying Radio Star Travels by Airplane for Broadcasts.\\" Greensboro (NC) Daily News, July 24, 1930, p. 17. After serving in the US Navy during World War I, Sannella spent the years 1920–1922 in Panama City working on violin and alto saxophone with various orchestras. He then settled in New York City where he played with the bands of Dan Gregory, Mike Markel and – not least – Ray Miller. With the latter orchestra Sannella seems to have made his first recordings during the years 1923–1925. On these recordings (which also feature jazz notables such as Frank Trumbauer and Miff Mole) Sannella is mainly featured on clarinet and alto saxophone, but is also heard soloing on bass clarinet on I Can't Get The One I Want (Brunswick 2643). As a studio musician Van Dyke label. From the late 1920s onwards Sannella seems to have focused more and more on working as a studio musician rather than appearing with regular working bands. He was very much in demand and was hired by many conductors leading \\"house bands\\" for various record companies, including Nat Shilkret and Leonard Joy (both Victor Records), Ben Selvin (Columbia Records), Adrian Schubert (Banner Records and associated labels) and Bert Hirsch (Hit of the Week Records). Sannella also appears on several recordings directed by Sam Lanin, but it is not clear whether he also appeared with this orchestra on stage. In addition to working with larger orchestras Sannella also appeared with many smaller studio groups accompanying popular singers of the time such as Art Gillham, Cliff Edwards, Frank Crumit, Seger Ellis and Johnny Marvin. In many of the orchestras listed above Sannella was working with the same basic core of fellow musicians, among these not least trumpet player Mike Mosiello, from whom Sannella seems to have been virtually inseparable during these years, and of whom he still spoke very highly in an interview shortly before his death. Amongst many other things Mosiello and Sannella (together with accordionist Charles Magnante) formed the nucleus of the prolific house band of the Grey Gull Company of Boston during the years 1926–1930. In addition to performing the popular tunes of the day Mosiello and Sannella were allowed to wax several instrumental numbers of their own, often appearing as B-sides on the company's \\"pop\\" records. On these records Sannella is mainly featured playing alto saxophone, clarinet and steel guitar, often switching between all these instruments during the same number and thus giving them a very special noticeable sound. An article in the Milwaukee Journal from 1929 also lists: the accordion, violin, and ukulele among the twelve instruments he played. Journal Songs credited to Sannella himself issued by Grey Gull include Needin' You and Sleeping Birds. Recordings in his own name Hit of the Week record by Sannella's orchestra. The Grey Gull records were almost always issued anonymously or under pseudonym. However, for other labels Sannella was allowed to record with bands under his own name (ranging from trios to full dance orchestras) given proper credit. Labels for which Sannella recorded under his own name included Harmony, Columbia, Okeh, Victor and Hit of the Week. For Brunswick Sannella also recorded as a steel guitar soloist, his coupling of Sliding on the Frets and Blues of the Guitar from 1929 (Brunswick 4484) becoming a minor hit and being issued in Europe as well (Slidin' On The Frets has also been reissued on CD). Apparently these recordings made Sannella's name familiar enough to make The Selmer Company, a well known manufacturer of musical instruments, use Sannella's picture in their advertising. Sannella composed Valse Selmer to promote the company's saxophones. Later career: radio, theatre and television work Beginning with 1932 Sannella's appearances on records became increasingly rarer. Instead he was heard frequently on radio where, among other things, he directed four NBC radio programs and performed on shows including the Sylvester Hour, the General Motors Hour, the Stromber-Carlson Hour, the Halsey-Stuart Hour, with the Armstrong Quakers, and in the Lucky Strike Dance Orchestra.\\"Andy Sannella Has a Hard Time for His Paltry $1,100.\\" https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat;=19290331&id;=UqtQAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=KyIEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5403,2828457&hl;=en. The Milwaukee Journal. Milwaukee. March 31, 1929. Retrieved September 14, 2015 From the late 1940s he also appeared regularly on TV shows for CBS. By this date Sannella was mainly performing as a pianist and organ player. He also directed a couple of shows on Broadway. Now and then Sannella also returned to the recording studios well into the 1950s. Among his last records is an LP called The Girl Friends (Everest SDBR-1005, issued in 1958) where he plays standards and jazz numbers that have titles consisting of girls' names.

It is one of the more common methods by which a laminar bounded shear flow transitions to turbulence. The waves are initiated when some disturbance (sound, for example) interacts with leading edge roughness in a process known as receptivity. These waves are slowly amplified as they move downstream until they may eventually grow large enough that nonlinearities take over and the flow transitions to turbulence. These waves, originally discovered by Ludwig Prandtl, were further studied by two of his former students, Walter Tollmien and Hermann Schlichting after whom the phenomenon is named. Also, the T-S wave is defined as the most unstable eigen- mode of Orr–Sommerfeld equationsSchmid, Peter J., Henningson, Dan S., Stability and Transition in Shear Flows (https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387989853) (Page 64).  Physical mechanism  In order for a boundary layer to be absolutely unstable (have an inviscid instability), it must satisfy Rayleigh's criterion; namely D^{2}U = 0 where D represents the y-derivative and U is the free stream velocity profile. In other words, the velocity profile must have an inflection point to be unstable. It is clear that in a typical boundary layer with a zero pressure gradient, the flow will be unconditionally stable; however, we know from experience this is not the case and the flow does transition. It is clear, then, that viscosity must be an important factor in the instability. It can be shown using energy methods that \\\\frac{DE}{Dt} = -\\\\int_{V}u'v'\\\\left(\\\\frac{dU}{dy}\\\\right)-\\\\frac{1}{R}\\\\int_{V}\\\\left( abla \\\\vec{v}'\\\\right)^{2} The rightmost term is a viscous dissipation term and is stabilizing. The left term, however, is the Reynolds stress term and is the primary production method for instability growth. In an inviscid flow, the u' and v' terms are orthogonal, so the term is zero, as one would expect. However, with the addition of viscosity, the two components are no longer orthogonal and the term becomes nonzero. In this regard, viscosity is destabilizing and is the reason for the formation of T-S waves.  Transition phenomena = Initial disturbance  In a laminar boundary layer, if the initial disturbance spectrum is nearly infinitesimal and random (with no discrete frequency peaks), the initial instability will occur as two- dimensional Tollmien–Schlichting waves, travelling in the mean flow direction if compressibility is not important. However, three-dimensionality soon appears as the Tollmien–Schlichting waves rather quickly begin to show variations. There are known to be many paths from Tollmien–Schlichting waves to turbulence, and many of them are explained by the non-linear theories of flow instability.  Final transition  A shear layer develops viscous instability and forms Tollmien–Schlichting waves which grow, while still laminar, into finite amplitude (1 to 2 percent of the freestream velocity) three-dimensional fluctuations in velocity and pressure to develop three- dimensional unstable waves and hairpin eddies. From then on, the process is more a breakdown than a growth. The longitudinally stretched vortices begin a cascading breakdown into smaller units, until the relevant frequencies and wave numbers are approaching randomness. Then in this diffusively fluctuating state, intense local changes occur at random times and locations in the shear layer near the wall. At the locally intense fluctuations, turbulent 'spots' are formed that burst forth in the form of growing and spreading spots — the result of which is a fully turbulent state downstream. = The simple harmonic transverse sound of Tollmien–Schlichting (T-S) waves = Tollmien (1931)Walter Tollmien (1931): Grenzschichttheorie, in: Handbuch der Experimentalphysik IV,1, Leipzig, S. 239–287. and Schlichting (1929)Hermann Schlichting (1929) \\"Zur Enstehung der Turbulenz bei der Plattenströmung\\". Nachrichten der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften – enshaften zu Göttingen, Mathematisch – Physikalische zu Göttingen, Mathematisch – Physikalische Klasse, 21-44. theorized that viscosity-induced grabbing and releasing of laminae created long-crested simple harmonic (SH) oscillations (vibrations) along a smooth flat boundary, at a flow rate approaching the onset of turbulence. These T-S waves would gradually increase in amplitude until they broke up into the vortices, noise and high resistance that characterize turbulent flow. Contemporary wind tunnels failed to show T-S waves. In 1943, Schubauer and Skramstad (S and S)G.B. Schubauer, H.K. Skramstad (1943) Laminar-boundary-layer-oscillations and transition on a flat plate. Advance Confidential Report. National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, 1-70. created a wind tunnel that went to extremes to damp mechanical vibrations and sounds that might affect the airflow studies along a smooth flat plate. Using a vertical array of evenly spaced hot wire anemometers in the boundary layer (BL) airflow, they substantiated the existence of T-S oscillations by showing SH velocity fluctuations in the BL laminae. The T-S waves gradually increased in amplitude until a few random spikes of in-phase amplitude appeared, triggering focal vortices (turbulent spots), with noise. A further increase in flow rate resulted suddenly in many vortices, aerodynamic noise and a great increase in resistance to flow. An oscillation of a mass in a fluid creates a sound wave; SH oscillations of a mass of fluid, flowing in that same fluid along a boundary, must result in SH sound, reflected off the boundary, transversely into the fluid. S and S found foci of in-phase spiking amplitude in the T-S waves; these must create bursts of high amplitude sound, with high energy oscillation of fluid molecules transversely through the BL laminae. This has the potential to freeze laminar slip (laminar interlocking) in these spots, transferring the resistance to the boundary: this breaking at the boundary could rip out pieces of T-S long-crested waves which would tumble head-over-heels downstream in the boundary layer as the vortices of turbulent spots. With further increase in flow rate, there is an explosion into turbulence, with many random vortices and the noise of aerodynamic sound. Schubauer and Skramstad overlooked the significance of the co-generation of transverse SH sound by the T-S waves in transition and turbulence. However, John Tyndall (1867) in his transition-to-turbulence flow studies using flames,John Tyndall (1867) \\"On the action of sonorous vibrations on gaseous and liquid jets\\", Philosophical Magazine 33: 375-391. deduced that SH waves were created during transition by viscosity acting around the walls of a tube and these could be amplified by blending with similar SH sound waves (from a whistle), triggering turbulence at lower flow rates. Schubauer and Skramstad introduced SH sound into the boundary layer by creating SH fluttering vibrations of a BL ferromagnetic ribbon in their 1941 experiments, similarly triggering turbulence at lower flow rates. Tyndall’s contribution towards explaining the mystery of transition to turbulence 150 years ago is beginning to gain recognition.Hamilton (2015) Simple Harmonics, pp. 2-4, Aylmer Express, Aylmer, Ontario References Category:Waves Category:Fluid dynamics ","title":"Tollmien–Schlichting wave"},{"id":"18712615","text":"Lachesis acrochorda is a venomous pit viper species found in Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador.

Specifically, it measures contractile force of the bladder when voiding. The resulting chart generated from cystometric analysis is known as a cystometrogram (CMG), which plots volume of liquid emptied from bladder against intravesical pressure.  Use  Diagram of cystometry in a female patient. Cystometric analysis is used to evaluate the bladder's capacity to contract and expel urine. It helps determine the source of urinary problems. A normal CMG effectively rules out primary vesical dysfunction. It is used as a component for diagnosis of various disorders including urinary tract infections, multiple sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord injury, urethral obstruction, and overactive bladder, among others.  Procedure  The procedure is relatively short, ranging from fifteen minutes to an hour in duration. It involves the insertion of one or two catheters into an emptied bladder through the urethra. In the two catheter method, one catheter transfers liquid while the other is a manometer (pressure sensor). In the single catheter method, a specialized catheter performs both functions. An additional rectal catheter may also be placed for additional data. The bladder will then be filled with saline and the patient's awareness of the event will be queried. The patient will often be asked to note when presence of liquid is felt, when the bladder feels full, and when the urgency to void is felt. The patient is then asked to void, and both flow and pressure are recorded. These are plotted against each other to create the cystometrogram.  Results  Cystometrogram showing high frequency oscillations characteristic of expulsion of liquid in the rat. The primary results of cystometric analysis is the cystometrogram. The x-axis is the volume of liquid and the y-axis is the intraluminal pressure of the bladder. In normal patients, the plot is a series of spikes whose local minimums form a non-linear curve resembling an exponential growth curve. The spikes correspond to the bladder contractions associated with the micturition reflex. The curve formed by the bottom of the plot reflects the level of pressure necessary to void. In normal patients, the first couple hundred milliliters of urine flow with minimal applied pressure. Increasing pressure is necessary to void 200-300 milliliters of urine. Beyond that, the pressure necessary to void additional urine rises sharply.  Risks and contraindications  As with any catheterization, the primary risk is of urinary tract infection. As a result, the procedure is contraindicated in any patient with an active UTI because the results may be skewed and the infection may spread . There is also the potential for trauma to the bladder and urethra, which may result in hematuria (blood in the urine).

He continued his career at Xerxes and later, when his friends joined Sparta Rotterdam he was scouted by Feyenoord and he played in their youth squads for a few years. Because he did not feel at home at Feyenoord he played for RVVH Ridderkerk for a while before joining FC Dordrecht. Because his education was suffering from all the football commitments he decided to slow down on it and focus on his school again. He felt it was time for a change and fighting sports got his interest at first. For three years he practiced ninjutsu, but he did not know if he would feel like continuing in the sport. When his former girlfriend told him about sprinting he was unsure if another change in sports would be a smart thing. After asking several more times he finally decided to do an athletics trial with a friend in which they did all athletics disciplines from shot put to long jump and from high jump to javelin throw. The last and final event was the sprint and he was addicted straight away. As of October 2004 he started becoming active as a sprinter, training twice a week. It didn't take him a long time to become the fastest runner at the team and this encouraged him to become better. In local meetings with other teams however he was not able to win yet and because he always wanted to win he decided to join a better team named Rotterdam Atletiek. From February 2005 he is coached by Errol Esajas and since that time he is training six times a week instead of the two times before. This resulted in his participation at the European Championships of 2006 after only being active in the sport for two years. At the European Championships he reached the final with the 4 × 100 metres relay team together with Timothy Beck, Caimin Douglas and Guus Hoogmoed.

Van Luijk also participated at the 200 metres where he was eliminated in the second round. In 2007 Van Luijk won his first national title at the 60 metres indoor and a year later he tried to defend his title, but he came only 0.004 too short on Guus Hoogmoed to finish in second position that time. Later in 2008 he became the Dutch national champion over 100 and 200 metres outdoor, claiming his second and third title. The 4 × 100 metres relay team together with team mates Maarten Heisen, Caimin Douglas and Guus Hoogmoed (Gregory Sedoc and Virgil Spier as reserves) did qualify for the Olympics. Initially they finished in 17th position during the qualification process while only the first 16 teams would qualify, but due to the cancellation of the Australian team they were allowed to start in Beijing.Atleet Caimin Douglas toch naar Peking, antilliaans.caribiana.nl, ret: Aug 3, 2008 In their qualification heat Heisen, Hoogmoed, Van Luijk and Douglas placed third in behind Trinidad and Tobago and Japan, but in front of Brazil.

Life She was the youngest child of pious Catholic peasants. A troublesome child, proud, ambitious, and self-contained, she was the constant subject of her mother's prayers. According to her own narrative, written under obedience, she was a poor, lowly, country girl, knowing nothing but what her mother taught her. She received a strong impression of the Divine presence, aged 11, at her first Communion. About a year after, Marie saw at Mass during the Elevation of the Host, a bright light which seemed to inflame her love for the Eucharistic Lord and to increase as that love increased. Soon she was cast into severe interior trials and temptations. Her spiritual director allowed her to make a yearly vow of virginity, and the Blessed Sacrament became the central thought of her life. According to her own narrative, towards the end of 1839, when she was seventeen, she saw Christ on the altar. On the Epiphany, 1840, this was repeated, and for three whole years every time she assisted at Mass this grace was granted her. Almost daily she received from the lips of Jesus instructions forming a complete spiritual and doctrinal education. She never mentioned this except to her confessor. In 1840 M. l'Abbé Pierre Darbins succeeded M. Farbos as curé of Mimbaste. Marie revealed her soul to him. He asked the help of the director of the seminary of Dax, and they agreed to order her to put in writing everything supernatural she had heard and seen in the past, and all she might hear and see in the future. After many objections and delays, she obtained permission to join the Society of the Sacred Heart, recently founded, and left for Paris, 21 April 1844, alone. She was received at the Hôtel Biron by Madame de Boisbaudry, who had her examined by an experienced spiritual guide. She was admitted as a lay sister on May 15. Still a novice, she was sent to Rennes in the hope that a change of air would improve her health. Marie's vows had been postponed in the hope of an improvement in her health. But on Sunday, May 9, she became suddenly so very ill that the end seemed near. She was allowed to pronounce her vows, just before receiving the last sacraments. Her remains were later taken to Roehampton, near London. Works The true text has been so much interpolated by the editor that the Works of Marie Lataste are not considered authentic.

His marriage to Jeanie (Jane) Spencer, daughter of Savannah customs collector William Spencer, on 30 March 1765 gave him \\"instant respectibility\\". However, due to a lack of land on which to plant seeds, in the spring of 1765 Bowen asked Henry Yonge, the Surveyor-General of Georgia, to plant seed that he had brought from China. In a letter dated 23 December 1766, Yonge wrote: > This is to certify that the peas or vetches, lately introduced by Mr. Samuel > Bowen in this province from China, were planted by me the last year at Mr. > Bowen's request, and did yield three crops ; and had the frost kept of one > week longer, I should have had a fourth crop ; which is a very extraordinary > increase, and must, if attended to and encouraged, be of great utility and > advantage to this, and his majesty's other southern American provinces. Two weeks after his wedding, Bowen purchased of land at Thunderbolt, east of Savannah, where he built a ranch which he called \\"Greenwich\\". Funds for the purchase were possibly provided by James Flint, a long-time employee of the EIC in China whom Bowen had met on board the Success back in 1759. On his new estate, Bowen began to grow soya beans, then known as \\"Luk Taw\\" or \\"Chinese vetch\\", from which he made soy sauce and vermicelli noodles. He suspected that the sprouts of his plants had antiscorbutic properties that would be of use to the British Royal Navy in their fight against scurvy, research that led to his receiving a gold medal from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce in 1766 and a gift of £200 from King George III. The following year, Bowen received a patent from the British government for his \\"new invented method of preparing and making sago, vermicelli and soy from plants growing in America, to be equal in goodness to those made in the East Indies\\". According to the 1805 The American Universal Geography, Bowen also introduced tea from China to Georgia.  Death and legacy  Bowen died in London, England, on 30 December 1777. Two years later, his widow Jane became host to two officers from the fleet of Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing, at Greenwich during the Second Battle of Savannah. She supervised the burial of Polish General Casimir Pulaski, who was killed during the battle, \\"between her mansion and the river\\". Upon her death in 1782, she bequeathed her four children 26 slaves, 15 cows, and two oxen, along with a variety of machines for the processing of sago.

The Fatimid Caliphate was initially established in the Maghreb, with its roots in a ninth-century Shia Ismailist religious movement originating in Iraq and Iran. Many monuments survive in the Fatimid cities founded in North Africa, starting with Mahdia, on the Tunisian coast, the principal city prior to the conquest of Egypt in 969 and the building of al-Qahira, the \\"City Victorious\\", now part of modern-day Cairo. The period was marked by a prosperity amongst the upper echelons, manifested in the creation of opulent and finely wrought objects in the decorative arts, including carved rock crystal, lustreware and other ceramics, wood and ivory carving, gold jewelry and other metalware, textiles, books and coinage. These items not only reflected personal wealth, but were used as gifts to curry favour abroad. The most precious and valuable objects were amassed in the caliphal palaces in al- Qahira. In the 1060s, following several years of drought during which the armies received no payment, the palaces were systematically looted, the libraries largely destroyed, precious gold objects melted down, with a few of the treasures dispersed across the medieval Christian world. Afterwards Fatimid artifacts continued to be made in the same style, but were adapted to a larger populace using less precious materials. Rock crystal ewers Rock crystal ewers are pitchers carved from a single block of rock crystal. They were made by Islamic Fatimid artisans and are considered to be amongst the rarest objects in Islamic art.Fatimid Rock Crystal Ewers, Most Valuable Objects in Islamic Art There are a few that survived and are now in collections across Europe. They are often in cathedral treasuries, where they were rededicated after being captured from their original Islamic settings. Made in Egypt in the late 10th century, the ewer pictured is exquisitely decorated with fantastic birds, beasts and twisting tendrils. The Treasure of Caliph Mostansir-Billah at Cairo, which was destroyed in 1062, apparently contained 1800 rock crystal vessels. Great skill was required to hollow out the raw rock crystal without breaking it and to carve the delicate, often very shallow, decoration. Fatimid architecture In architecture, the Fatimids followed Tulunid techniques and used similar materials, but also developed those of their own. In Cairo, their first congregational mosque was al-Azhar mosque (\\"the splendid\\") founded along with the city (969–973), which, together with its adjacent institution of higher learning (al-Azhar University), became the spiritual center for Ismaili Shia. The Mosque of al-Hakim (r. 996–1013), an important example of Fatimid architecture and architectural decoration, played a critical role in Fatimid ceremonial and procession, which emphasized the religious and political role of the Fatimid caliph. Besides elaborate funerary monuments, other surviving Fatimid structures include the Aqmar Mosque (1125)Doris Behrens-Abouseif (1992), Islamic Architecture in Cairo: An Introduction, BRILL, p. 72 as well as the monumental gates for Cairo's city walls commissioned by the powerful Fatimid emir and vizier Badr al-Jamali (r. 1073–1094).

One of the initial objectives of the Coalition campaign in Iraq was to capture the Gas and Oil Platforms (\\"GOPLATs\\") in the Al-Faw Peninsula intact before it could be sabotaged or destroyed by the Iraqi military. This would prevent an ecological disaster similar to the 1991 Gulf War and enable a quicker take over of Iraqi oil production. The British Royal Marines' 3 Commando Brigade would also capture Umm Qasr at the same time so that its port, the only deep water port in Iraq, could be used to bring in heavy military supplies once the Khawr Abd Allah waterway was cleared by the Mine Counter Measures Task group. The United States Marine Corps placed 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit under the command of 3 Commando Brigade so that the Brigade had the necessary force to capture both targets.

During the Gulf War, the Iraqis had mined the waterway and the northern Gulf, coalition commanders suspected they would do the same again, so the coalition despatched minesweepers to clear the areas of mines. The eastern side of the waterway was part of the al-Faw peninsula and Iraqi-occupied, the mine- sweepers were not heavily armed or armoured and would be vulnerable to the Iraqi defenses on both the bank and from the rest of the al-Faw peninsula, the waterway was shallow and its canals were dry so large warships could not provide an effective defence for the mine-sweepers. So it became necessary to the coalition commanders that the eastern bank of the Khawr Abd Allah waterway and the al-Faw peninsula had to be secured; additionally, the docks at Umm Qasr could only be used safely if the al-Faw peninsula was secured.Rossiter, Mike, Target Basra , Corgi, 2009 ,p56-p57 Another important objective on the al-Faw peninsula was the Iraqi oil infrastructure, coalition analysis of the major Iraqi southern oilfields, the routes of the pipelines and locations of the pumping-stations revealed that they all culminated in the al-Faw peninsula where 90% of Iraq's oil was exported through the peninsula via two gas and oil platforms just a few miles off the al-faw coast.Rossiter, Mike, Target Basra , Corgi, 2009 ,p59 Plan The plan for the assault and eventual capture of the al-Faw peninsula was that US Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 3 would make the initial assault on the MMS (monitoring and metering station) and the pipelines that allowed Iraq to export its oil from the southern fields to the Gulf, landing via 8 MH-53 helicopters. After 30 minutes the Royal Marines would take over whilst the SEALs would depart. The main objective for 800 marines from 40 Commando as part of the brigades objective was to secure the MMS, B and C company and the MSG (Maneuver Support Group) would land by helicopters (that had previously taken in the SEALs), on the eastern bank of the Khawr Abd Allah waterway to secure it and then set up a defensive perimeter around the MMS. An hour later, A and D company would be flown in by Chinook and Sea King helicopters and the rest of 40 commando would then move out and capture the rest of the peninsula and the town of al-Faw. 3 ships from the Royal Navy and 1 from the Royal Australian Navy were assigned to provide fire support, as well as an AC-130.Rossiter, Mike, Target Basra , Corgi, 2009 p61-62,p91,p100,p104,p.138,p139,p140,p14 800+ commandos of 42 Commando, would land via 37 RAF CH-47, Royal Navy Sea King and US Marine Corps CH-46 helicopters, and north of 40 commando to create a blocking force against Iraqi forces to the north, they would be led in by USMC Cobra's teams of US troops were attached to the Commandos to liaise with US air support. A B-52 bomber would drop 16 JDAM's on Iraqi positions 17 minutes before the SEAL insertion, a flight of A-10s and an AC-130 gunship would also be in support, predator drones provided surveillance. The Royal Marines BRF (Brigade Reconnaissance Force) would also deploy to support 42 commando, a few minutes after 40 commando landed, Royal Marine artillery and British Army self-propelled guns would fire on Iraqi artillery positions on the peninsulaRossiter, Mike, Target Basra , Corgi, 2009 , p93,p99,p103,p112,p113,p147,p151 According to coalition intelligence, The Iraqi 6th Armoured Division equipped with 100 T-55 tanks were stationed to defend the approaches to Basra and could be sent to intervene, some of its units were based on the peninsula itself and were just a few hours away from the coalition objectives, at least 150 aircraft were ready to launch support operations against them.Rossiter, Mike, Target Basra , Corgi, 2009 , p66,p92,p116,p.140 The Assault Al-Faw Peninsula, Iraq 20 March Following days of bad weather, the assault on Al Faw was set for 2200 hours (local time) on 20 March 2003, US gunships and fighter-bombers attacked the known Iraqi positions on the peninsula in a short bombardment prior to the operation. The B-52 arrived on time and they released their bombs on various Iraqi bunkers, trenches and dugouts around the oil facilities on the al-Faw peninsula, 5 minutes later A-10s arrived to destroy any anti aircraft guns or missiles, however they couldn't see their targets due to the dust cloud created from the JDAMs, so they went into a holding pattern until it cleared. A and D company of SEALs and other special forces units would assault on the MSS and the pipelines was successful, after a brief firefight they killed 1 Iraqi soldier and captured 13 more.Rossiter, Mike, Target Basra , Corgi, 2009 , p149,p153, At the same time B and C company would commence air and sea landings, securing the gas and oil platforms out at sea. Special Boat Team 22 inserted SEAL Teams 8 and 10 to capture the Mina Al Bakr Oil Terminal and Polish GROM commandos captured the Khor Al-Amaya Oil Terminal. 32 Iraqi prisoners were also captured. Explosive Ordnance Disposal were then landed on the platforms to search for and remove explosive booby traps and demolition charges. An AC-130 guided in the RAF Chinook helicopters carrying the Commando's from 40 Commando, the helicopter insertion was successful and the Commandos secured the MSS and the pipelines, whilst assaulting buildings at the MSS, the Commandos killed 2 Iraqi soldiers. Resistance was light: D company came under sporadic fire from an Iraqi Bunker, two 1000 and 500-pound bombs released from an F-18 as well as 40mm and 105mm shells from an AC-130 destroyed the bunker. The Iraqi POW's captured by the SEALs were given over to the commandos. The MSG moved out to the town of al-Faw to take control of its access points, on the way, they attacked two Iraqi-occupied trenches and a gatehouse. The firefight lasted for an hour, eventually securing the position. With the support of the AC-130, the MSG killed 8 Iraqi soldiers and captured 25. There were still a further 200 Iraqi soldiers in other trenches and they began calling in mortars on the MSS, AC-130 gunfire silenced the mortars and demoralised the Iraqis; B company was locked in a sporadic firefight with an Iraqi bunker, which they eventually cleared, whilst A company assaulted an Iraqi-occupied trench, bunker and mortar position with AC-130 support, killing the occupants. D company neutralized another Iraqi bunker with naval gun fire; without taking any casualties, 40 Commando took over 200 Iraqi prisoners.Rossiter, Mike, Target Basra , Corgi, 2009 , p149,p153-155,p160,p162-164,p166-167,p173-174 A second assault by 42 Commando followed at 2225 hours. The second assault was preceded by artillery and naval bombardment, the artillery fire came from three British and one US artillery batteries positioned on Bubiyan Island, the naval component from HMS Richmond, HMS Marlborough, HMS Chatham and HMAS Anzac. The Marines were preceded by USMC AH-1 Cobra helicopters gunships and flown in by USMC helicopters to land just north of the town of Al Faw, destroying Iraqi artillery. The insertion began badly with appalling visibility, worsened by fires and sand. The Headquarters of the Brigade Reconnaissance Force crashed in a US CH-46 Sea Knight as the assault formation turned over the Brigade assembly area, killing the seven Royal Marines, one Royal Navy operator and four US marine Corps aviators aboard.Mark Ormrod, Man Down, Random House, 2009, p.145 The cloud base dropped even further and the commander of the US Marine Air Wing decided to call off any further landings.Rossiter, Mike, Target Basra , Corgi, 2009 ,p189 A new insertion was planned, using RAF Chinook and Puma helicopters, for dawn. The landings finally took place, six hours late and onto insecure landing zones, all the objectives were taken and secured. 42 Commando became the most forward unit in the al-Faw peninsula. They came under friendly fire from a USMC Cobra but no casualties occurred. 21 March NVG view of Royal Marines disembarking on HMS Ark Royal, for operations on the al Faw peninsula, 21 March 2003. A few hours after the Commandos landed, a group of Iraqi soldiers approached the commandos position, the commandos' machineguns and an AC-130 fired on them killing all but one, who was captured. A company moved out to the town of al-Faw and set up blocking positions to the south east, whilst D company cleared an Iraqi barracks and bunker, following intelligence received from Iraqi locals, the 105 members of A company moved into the town. Whilst in the waste ground in the eastern part of the town the commandos were ambushed, they returned fire killing 7 Iraqis, as they withdrew the commandos came under fire from Iranian border guards. A company halted in the centre of town and prepared to continue their attack when it got dark, they attacked a Ba'athist party headquarters killing 7 Fedayeen fighters, 3 commandos became casualties, in the night the rest of the Fedayeen and Iraqi troops surrendered.Rossiter, Mike, Target Basra , Corgi, 2009 , p156,p176,p180-182,p186 42 Commando, engaged and called in artillery on Fedayeen SUV vehicles entering their battle area, destroying 2, as they moved north, J company came under artillery fire they were attacked by a troop of Iraqis and a T-55 tank, Iranian border guards fired on them, the commandos called in British artillery which destroyed the Iraqi tank and troops.Rossiter, Mike, Target Basra , Corgi, 2009 , p205-207 Plans to land British armour by hovercraft were abandoned once Royal EngineersRossiter, Mike, Target Basra , Corgi, 2009 ,p175 discovered extensive mining of the beaches near Al Faw which posed too great a danger to heavy U.S. Navy hovercraft carrying UK Scimitars. The 12 Scimitars of C Squadron Queen's Dragoon Guards, which had been loaded onto Hovercraft aboard the USS Rushmore for the landing were instead landed back in Kuwait and finally crossed the waterway north of Umm Qasr twenty-four hours late. 22 March Fedayeen Saddam paramilitaries continued scattered fighting around Umm Qasr. Two Royal Navy Sea King helicopters collided, killing 7 people. 23 March 15 MEU (later relieved by 42 Commando) achieved their main objectives of securing Umm Qasr ahead of schedule, within 48 hours of crossing the Iraqi border. They then pushed north along the west bank of the Khawr Abd Allah waterway encountering stiff resistance from Fedayeen Saddam. 24 March 40 Commando were tasked to move up the al-Faw peninsula towards Basra; the operation was codenamed Operation Leah. The 12 Scimitars of C squadron Queen's Dragoon Guards linked up with 40 Commando and the BRF, with the majority of the force moving along Highway 6 whilst others set up observation posts; the highway from Umm Qasr to Basra was guarded by the Iraqi 6th Armoured Division, 18th Infantry Division and the 51st Mechanized Division with 220–250 tanks. The forward observation posts soon detected Iraqi troops and tanks setting up a defensive line north of highway 6. West of the highway, a Scimitar came under fire from an Iraqi T-55; the Scimitar destroyed it with a mounted anti-tank missile. An Iraqi armoured brigade attempted a counterattack on al Faw, the force was made up of 60 T-55 tanks, a troop of 4 tanks fired on the Scimitars so the crews called in A-10s and they destroyed the 4 Iraqi tanks. Throughout the day repeated troops of Iraqi tanks attacked C Squadron's Scimitars who called in F-18 and A-10 air support to destroy them, A company boarded 6 Sea King helicopters and flew to a forward position to protect 8 Battery, 29 Commando, Royal Artillery as it moved its 105mm guns to within firing range of the Iraqi armoured brigade's attack. 8th Battery artillery guns, the A-10s and the F-18s airstrikes, as well as by 40 Commando had destroyed over 20 T-55s, the rest retreated back to Basra. 42 Commando relieved the 15th MEU in Umm Qasr.Rossiter, Mike, Target Basra , Corgi, 2009 , p219,p245-251 With the route to Umm Qasr declared safe and the Al Faw Peninsula largely in Coalition hands, this allowed the British 7th Armoured Brigade to press on to Basrah and US forces to advance on Baghdad without the threat of Iraqi forces near Basrah flanking through Al Faq and attacking Coalition supply lines.

It typically includes programme schedules, announcement of the programme immediately following and trailers or descriptions of forthcoming programmes. Continuity can be spoken by an announcer or displayed in text over graphics. On television continuity generally coincides with a display of the broadcaster's logo or ident. Advertisements are generally not considered part of continuity because they are advertising another company. A continuity announcer is a broadcaster whose voice (and, in some cases, face) appears between radio or television programmes to give programme information. Continuity announcers tell viewers and listeners which channel they are watching or listening to at the moment (or which station they are tuned to), what they are about to see (or hear), and what they could be watching (or listening to) if they changed to a different channel operated by the broadcaster. At the end of programmes, they may read out information about the previous programme, for example who presented and produced it, relay information or merchandise relating to the show, or to provide details of organisations who may offer support in relation to a storyline or issue raised in the programme. Continuity announcers may also play music during intervals and give details of programmes later in the day. If there is a breakdown, they make any necessary announcements and often play music for its duration. Usage=Television Television continuity announcements typically take one of two forms: * Out-of-vision, where only the announcer's voice is heard, either over the end sequence of a programme or on- screen graphics. With appropriate training in sound and vision mixing, this can be achieved with a single person acting as both voice and controller. * In-vision, where the announcer is seen delivering the announcement on-screen. This typically requires a number of people in a small studio, including sound engineers, vision mixers, and occasionally camera operators. Modern installations with motorised cameras can reduce this to two -- the presenter, and a technical assistant to perform the \\"backstage\\" functions such as adjusting the camera and mixing. Typically, in-vision announcers are utilised today in smaller television markets, usually where private commercial channels were introduced late. Currently, the following European television channels use in-vision announcers: * Finland: YLE TV1 * Ireland: TG4 * Norway: NRK1 * United Kingdom: CBBC, CBeebies, and BBC Alba * Poland: TVP1, TVP2 * Czech Republic: ČT3 * Slovakia: Trojka Radio With most radio stations now broadcasting only music, few networks retain continuity announcers. Exceptions include talk stations such as National Public Radio in the United States, BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service in the UK and Swedish SR P1 : in the case of Radio 4 they have the extra tasks of reading the Shipping Forecasts and gale warnings. Many also serve as newsreaders. Continuity around the world=Canada In Canada, CBC Television used in-vision announcers to 'host' primetime programming from 2001 to 2006. As the credits rolled, the announcer would describe upcoming episodes of the series, then introduce the next program at the top of the hour. The evening's host changed daily. Usually, the host was appearing in a major upcoming program the same week, giving the appearance that the host is promoting not only the next program in the evening but his or her own upcoming show. Sometimes CBC Radio newscasters or program hosts would appear as the evening TV hosts. The initiative, sometimes known as \\"Hosted Prime\\", only covered the CBC's core evening block (8:00 to 10:00 p.m. local) as opposed to programs in the 7:00 hour, and would not normally appear during the summer. CBC Radio One has used continuity announcers in recent years. Originally, a number of staff announcers shared the duties, however, in 2004, the service began employing actress Shauna MacDonald as its primary continuity announcer. Her identity remained a secret for more than a year, leading her to be dubbed \\"Promo Girl\\". MacDonald has since been replaced by Jeremy Harris, serving in a similar capacity for both Radio One and Radio 2. Omni Television in Toronto has used in-vision continuity announcers for the past 10 years or so. These \\"interstitial\\" segments fill in the time left in programming due to the different break structure of American TV programming, that cannot be filled by commercials in Canada due to Canadian broadcast regulations regarding the number of minutes of commercials allowable per hour. The segments range from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, and in addition to announcing the station and the programs coming up, the announcers will talk about other programming, station contests, quirky news or celebrity gossip. Continuity announcements on Citytv have been voiced by actor Dan Aykroyd and journalist Mark Dailey. Other Canadian stations will fill this time in by a news update or a teaser about news stories. Flanders, Belgium Until July 2015, één, VRT's main television station in the Flanders region of Belgium, used a team of four staff announcers, who performed in-vision and out-of-vision continuity links. VRT's children's station, Ketnet, also utilised in-vision continuity with announcing staff known on-air as Ketnetwrappers. Vtm, the main commercial television channel in Flanders, uses live out-of-vision announcers. The station utilised in-vision continuity until January 2008. vtm's sister station, 2BE, only utilises pre-recorded voiceovers. Both of SBS Belgium's television stations, VIER and VIJF no longer use any continuity announcers following the rebranding of the networks from VT4 and VIJFtv. China CCTV had offered in-vision continuity. However, this kind of segment has been withdrawn in recent years.  Germany  In German television, in-vision continuity was used until the mid-1990s. In-vision continuity announcers are known in German as Ansager for a male announcer or Ansagerin for a female announcer. Some stations still use pre-recorded voiceovers, or use voiceovers for promos only. Ireland All domestic terrestrial channels in Ireland make use of continuity announcers, mainly to introduce programmes, promote forthcoming programmes, provide information relating to the programme just broadcast and, in the case of stations with sister channels, cross-promote programmes on the other channel (such as linking between RTÉ One and Two, or TV3 and 3e). RTÉ One used in-vision continuity announcers until at least 2000. and in-vision continuity was briefly reprised in the late 1990s for overnight programmes. RTÉ Two used in-vision continuity announcers from its launch in November 1978 to at least 1986. In-vision continuity links were reprised on the channel, then known as Network 2, during the evening schedule, from 1997 to 2001. From January 2008, the daytime schedule on TV3 launched with two new in-vision continuity announcers, Conor Clear and Andrea Hayes. TG4 makes regular use of in-vision continuity during its evening schedule. Currently, TG4 employ six continuity announcers: *Mairéad Ní Chuaig *Fedelma Ní Ráighne *Cormac Ó Loideáin *Dáithí Ó Sé *Sinéad Ní Loideáin *Aoife Ní Thuairisg The station's announcers also present weather forecasts in-vision, and often mention forthcoming programmes during the weather bulletins. Italy Continuity announcers still appear in-vision on the three main RAI channels, where female continuity announcers are known as signorine buonasera (or 'good evening ladies'), although their role is much more marginal than it used to be. Past continuity announcers such as Nicoletta Orsomando or Rosanna Vaudetti are regarded today as cultural icons of the 1960s, particularly because of their impeccable elegance and perfect pronunciation of Italian. From 2003 until 2012, all in-vision links on Rai 1, Rai 2 and Rai 3 had been pre- recorded by a smaller team of station announcers. Rai 1 *Claudia Andreatti *Elisa Silvestrin Rai 2 *Alessandra Canale Rai 3 *Alessia Patacconi *Sarita Agnes Rossi Other Italian channels such as Retequattro, Canale 5 and Italia 1 also used their own team of signorine buonasera in the 1980s and 1990s. Japan In Japan, continuity segments on most TV stations are done by airing a program specifically for program promotion which is called which airs for a few minutes or longer. They are produced by the stations themselves and air at certain periods of the day and act as program fillers. The station's announcers present the program and introduce its upcoming programs on the station by airing clips from the program or air a promo. Some of the bansen bangumi are NHK Premap on NHK. North Korea Korean Central Television still offers in-vision continuity. Sweden In Sweden, a continuity announcer (or programme presenter) is informally known as a hallåa, which roughly means \\"helloer\\". This comes from the early days of radio when the main station in Stockholm contacted the other stations around the country by calling \\"hallå, hallå\\". Continuity announcers have been present on Swedish public television since November 1957. Initially, Sveriges Radio employed a team of both male and female announcers, but in the 1960s, the announcers became almost solely female. Male announcers returned in the 1970s. Both Kanal 1 and TV2, as well as the educational television service UR, continued to use in-vision announcers from the 1970s through to the 1990s, except for a few years in the early nineties when Kanal 1 (now SVT1) switched to out-of-vision continuity. In a cost-cutting exercise, SVT decided to drop live in-vision announcing from SVT2 in January 2005 and introduced pre-recorded voice-overs by SVT's announcing staff. The educational broadcaster UR dropped in-vision announcers by the end of 2006. A further review of SVT presentation led to the end of in-vision continuity on SVT1 on Sunday 4 March 2012. All SVT stations now use out-of-vision announcers. The largest commercial channel, TV4 has utilised in-vision announcers since it began broadcasting in 1990. Most other commercial channels broadcast from London and use out-of-vision announcers. Private channels with out-of-vision announcers include TV3, Kanal 5, TV6, Kanal 9 and TV4 Plus.  Southeast Asia  Today, in-vision announcers are used in Southeast Asia, especially in Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam. This list is Southeast Asian channels still using in-vision announcers: *Cambodia: TV3 (program menu also used), TV5 (military announcer) *Indonesia: TVRI, RCTI, SCTV, Indosiar, and Trans 7 *Laos: Lao National Television (not used as usual) *Thailand: TV7, TV3 (Program menu also used, After 2011 Program menu appears at right of announcer.), TV5 *Vietnam: Binh Thuan Television  Taiwan  Pre-recorded continuity announcements are offered on the TV channels in Taiwan. United Kingdom Continuity is used all the time in the United Kingdom. In general, continuity announcers are broadcast live on terrestrial television channels (BBC One, etc.), whereas pre-recorded announcements are used most of the time on digital and satellite channels. United States Not all major networks use continuity, although ABC (on which from the late 1970s until the mid-1990s, Ernie Anderson was known as \\"The Voice of ABC-TV\\" and served as the promotional voice and continuity announcer for the network) uses pre-recorded continuity for prime time broadcasts, and most of the continuity announcements are usually those in the middle of programs. None of the major networks use in-vision continuity. Most of the continuity announcements are usually recorded for promos for upcoming programs while some are placed before an upcoming program. Since the mid 1990s, it has also been common for networks to place trailers promoting upcoming programs during the preceding program's credits (known in some circles as \\"generic credits\\", \\"split-screen credits\\", \\"squeezed credits\\" or \\"credit crunch\\"). In most cases, networks and TV stations do not give out any information about the next program and would go straight to it without any introduction. In addition to showing promotional content for upcoming programs and those about the program (such as showing a preview on the upcoming episode of a preceding program), most stations with a newscast also show a brief promotion of upcoming newscasts, some of which would be broadcast directly from the news studio itself. Some PBS member stations and networks, most notably WNET during the 1980s, also use continuity announcers although continuity in the present day is either pre-recorded or retired in favor of promotions for other programs in between programs.

It is native to eastern North America, but has been introduced to Europe. It feeds primarily on insect larvae and other small aquatic invertebrates.  Description  It is an elongated, stout- bodied fish, brown or yellow-green in color, with about 10 or more dark, narrow, lateral stripes separated by pale spaces, although there is no lateral line on the fish. The pelvic fin lies somewhat farther back on the body, such that it rests below the dorsal fin. The body is elongated, and the maximum size of the fish is .  Distribution and habitat  The native range of the eastern mudminnow is from New York to Florida, and found as west as Georgia. It has also been introduced to Europe, where it can be found in France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Poland. It is generally found in still or slow-moving waters, often in dense vegetation, often over heavily vegetated streams, swamps, and ponds. The eastern mudminnow has show great adaptability to poor habitats with low pH, temperature, and presence of oxygen. At least one incident has been documented where an eastern mudminnow has survived an entire night out of water. The fish can be found in waters with a pH ranging from 3.5 to 8.1 in natural environments. The optimal pH for growth is 4.5, which is often detrimental or even fatal for most fish.  Diet  The eastern mudminnow are bottom-feeders and feed on insect larvae, worms, molluscs, and crustaceans.  Behavior  The eastern mudminnows are known to leap from the water while feeding.  Reproduction  Eastern mudminnows have been known to exhibit more complex reproductive behaviors. Males participate in courtship and the fish build nests. Nests can be found in cavities of algae, under loose rocks, and in depressions in the sand. Females guard nests, and males may as well. During courtship, males will quiver their bodies and show their fins.  Conservation = North America  In North America, the eastern mudminnow is usually viewed upon with little concern.  Europe  The eastern mudminnow is viewed as a potentially invasive species in much of Europe. The spread of the fish to six European countries in the 20th century is mostly attribute to popularity in the aquaculture and aquarium trades. The presence of eastern mudminnows in Europe can undermine the conservation efforts of vulnerable species such as the european mudminnow. The spread of the eastern mudminnow in these parts of Europe seems to be slow and primarily human mediated (due to usage as live bait or for aquariums). References * Smith, L. C.

The drug pipeline is also sometimes restricted to a particular drug class or extended to mean the process of discovering drugs (the research and development pipeline). The R&D; pipeline involves various phases that can broadly be grouped in 4 stages: discovery, pre-clinical, clinical trials and marketing (or post-approval). Pharmaceutical companies usually have a number of compounds in their pipelines. The drug pipeline is an important indicator of the value and future prospects of a company. Usually the more compounds in the pipeline, and the more advanced stage that these are in the better. Other factors that are taken into account when assessing the value of a pipeline include the size of the target market of each drug, the market share that the drug is expected to capture and the risk that it will not be approved. The cost of developing a new drug is astronomical – typically a drug costs many hundreds of millions and can reach 1 billion dollars over 15–17 years. Assessing this risk and filtering out as early as possible compounds that may not eventually get approved is essential to the pharmaceutical industry and involves checking the effectiveness of drugs as well as the likelihood of toxic events (Adverse event prediction).

At this team he showed to be talented, but his performances were not at the top level yet. Due to this there are no notable results of him as a D, C and B-junior. As an A-junior however he qualified himself at the Dutch National Championships for seniors through a fifth position at the decathlon (7164 points) for the Junior World Championships in Santiago. In Santiago he started with 10.54 over 100 metres, which was the fourth Dutch junior time in history. However, due to a hamstring injury he was unable to continue his tournament. A year later, in 2001 he was able to represent the Netherlands at the decathlon at the European Under-23 Championships that were held in Amsterdam. Also in this tournament he was suffering from an injury, but still managed to achieve a ninth position overall. In 2002 he came in second at the 60 metres indoor held at the Dutch National Championships. At the same event he reached the fourth place at the 60 metres hurdles. With these performances he qualified himself for the European Indoor Championships in Vienna for both distances. He eventually was eliminated in the first round series in both occasions.

He was well known for his races, when he would run the 20-mile stretch alongside the steam pleasure boats beside the rivers Wensum and Yare.Biography retrieved August 4, 2008  Early life  Cullum was born in the slums of his home city of Norwich. He never received a formal education, but he did however teach himself to read. He worked briefly at Caley's chocolate factory and by 1907 he was already legendary for his racing and street selling activities.  Later life  Cullum never married and lived with his mother, until her death. They lived at several addresses in the city including Oak Street, Colegate and Pkyerell House at St Mary's Plain. After his mother's death around 1930 he was reported to have entered Woodlands, part of the West Norwich Hospital.

Five years after his death, writer R L Potter wrote this description of him:  Nickname  Many theories have been put forward to how he received his name. In 1907, a reference was made to the 'bluelight' of his eloquence; another suggestion was that of his blue nose in winter, or that he sold blue-tipped matches.

He earned international recognition for his paintings, sculptures, murals and engravings. Life and work Pérez was born in San Telmo on the South side of Buenos Aires, and grew up in Liniers, on the opposite end of town. Working as a newsboy during childhood, he learned the basics of drawing and painting via correspondence classes. He enrolled at the Belgrano School of Fine Arts in 1954, and first exhibited at age 17, at Galería La Fantasma. Following his entry into the professional arts world, he began using his name in a reversed form. At the start of his career he has been influenced by Hungarian artist Victor Vasarely during a 1957 restrospective of the latter's works at the National Fine Arts Museum. He married Sara Fernández in 1959 and relocated to Uruguay for less than a year invited by Carlos Páez Vilaró . Took part in the \\"Group of 8\\"proponents of abstract art among the normally conservative local audiences. He returned to Buenos Aires in 1960, and opened a downtown atelier with the support of Guido Di Tella, his first mecena. Pérez Celis explored geometric art, and builds his first mural, Fuerza América, in 1962. Indigenous patterns and colors would reappear in many of his productions during the 1960s and 1970s, and distinguished him from most other local artists, among whom pop art and figurative art was more influential. He was featured in more than 120 solo shows during his career, notably the Gallerie Bellechasse, Anita Shapolsky Gallery New York, Arteconsult , Boston & Panama, Witcomb, etc and his art was purchased for many private collections and first-rate museums, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He received commissions from the Argentine government, which placed his works in the Ministro Pistarini International Airport, from other governments, and from prominent individuals and businesses. Tragedy struck Pérez Celis' life in 1975, when an automobile accident killed his wife, and resulted in months of physical therapy for his injuries. He remarried, to Margarita Laconich, in 1977, and lived in Caracas, Paris, New York City, and Miami in subsequent years. He shared his time between Buenos Aires and New York in 1994, a retrospective of his work was hosted at Biblioteca Nacional visited by more than 300000 persons. He continued exhibiting in Latin America, in the Sanyo Gallery in Tokyo, the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in New York City, and at numerous universities. Among his numerous recognitions in later years was the Alba Award at the 61st Salón Nacional de Artes Plásticas Argentino, and he was proclaimed a Distinguished Citizen of the City of Buenos Aires in 2001. He also created several literary illustrations, notably those for Jorge Luis Borges' Spanish-language translation of Walt Whitman's poem Leaves of Grass. A fan of the Club Atlético Boca Juniors football team, he created two murals in 1997 for the team's La Bombonera Stadium in Buenos Aires: \\"Idolos\\" (Idols) and \\"Mito y Destino\\" (Myth and Destiny), both Venetian mosaics and bronze on cement. Later years His daughter, actress María José Gabín, published a biography of her father in 2007. Pérez Celis developed leukemia, and underwent a lengthy series of treatments. Ultimately, however, the noted artist lost his life in Buenos Aires in 2008, at age 69. Filmography Excerpt from ¨Pérez Celis¨ * Pérez Celis, (Spanish) USA 2005. Written and directed by Eduardo Montes-Bradley. The documentary, a portrait of Pérez Celis, captures the artist at work in his atelier in Little Haiti. Throughout a series of conversations with Celis, Montes-Bradley manages to capture rare moments showing the artist at work. The creative process, the brushes on canvas, the mixing of colors, and the drawing of sketches share time on the screen with the anecdotical, and traces of a political road map followed by Celis from the mid-1940s to the present.

The Act The Act amended the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, further reducing rights of citizens of the Commonwealth of Nations countries (as of 2010, comprising approximately 1.9 billion people, including Commonwealth realms and Commonwealth republics) to migrate to the UK. The Act barred the future right of entry previously enjoyed by Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, to those born there or who had at least one parent or grandparent born there. Impact It was introduced amid concerns that up to 200,000 Kenyan Asians, fleeing that country's \\"Africanization\\" policy, would take up their right to reside in the UK. The bill went through parliament in three days, supported by the leadership of both the governing Labour and main opposition Conservative parties, though opposed by Labour backbenchers, a few Conservatives such as Iain Macleod and Michael Heseltine, and the small parliamentary Liberal Party. The passage of the Act was among the most divisive and controversial decisions taken by a British government.Hansen, R. (1999).

His name means \\"Christmas\\" in French. The series Noël was created in 1957 by André Franquin and Jidéhem and published in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Spirou, while Franquin created the following work alone or together with Will. Synopsis Noël lives in the little village of Champignac. As Christmas Day approaches, he is more sad and unhappy than ever because he has no friends and his parents are poor and can't afford gifts for him. However, each year, Noël lives a good Christmas, either thanks to the Marsupilami or the Elaoin Sdrétu. The atmosphere of the series was sometimes melancholic, as in some other of Franquin's work. The same atmosphere is also present in the Gaston Lagaffe series at the times of Christmas: the \\"miraculous\\" and idealized period of Christmas and New year is a recurring theme in Franquin's series. Some of Noël's stories were more humorous: in one story he and the Marsupilami go to a sports stadium to watch a tennis match -- only for the creature to ruin a wonderful game by catching the ball in mid-air. Characters * Noël is a small, shy, introverted, quite unhappy and unlucky boy. His schoolmates make fun of him. * The Elaoin Sdrétu is an automaton, a resourceful machine able to guess and provide what a human needs to be happy. * Marsupilami is a friendly animal whose extremely long and agile tail provides many possibilities.

Mary Juliana Hardman (name in religion Sister Mary) (26 April 1813 - 24 March 1884) was an English nun. Life Mary Juliana was one of a large recusant family, the Hardmans. Her father was John Hardman, senior, of Birmingham, a rich manufacturer, her mother his second wife, Lydia Waring. She was educated in the Benedictine convent at Caverswall, in Staffordshire, and, when she was nineteen, her father founded the convent of Our Lady of Mercy at Handsworth, near Birmingham. In 1840 Miss Hardman and three friends offered themselves to Bishop Walsh, to form the nucleus of a new community, and by his advice they went to make their novitiate under Mother Catherine McAuley, founder of the Institute of the Sisters of Mercy, Baggot Street, Dublin. The novices made their profession on 19 August 1841, and a day or two later Mother McAuley accompanied them to the new convent at Handsworth, where they were solemnly received by Bishop Nicholas Wiseman. Shortly afterwards Sister Mary Juliana was appointed first prioress of the community, and held that office off and on for thirty-five years, her first appointment lasting for six. She was then elected for three years, and twice re-elected for the same period, and from 1870 she held the office of superioress till her death. In 1849 she opened another convent at St. Chad's, Birmingham, and also one at Wolverhampton. The next year she built an almonry for the relief of the poor, and opened poor-schools. In 1851 she placed the orphanage founded by her father at Maryvale under the care of Sisters of her community, making her own sister, Mary Hardman, in religion Sister Mary of the Holy Ghost, superioress. In 1858 she built a middle-class boarding-school; twelve years later she erected elementary schools for the working classes at Handsworth; and in 1874 she opened a middle-class day-school for both of boys and girls. She died at Handsworth, at the age of seventy. Her brother, John Hardman, founded in 1844 Hardman & Co., the ecclesiastical metal works and stained glass works at Birmingham.

Their elderly aunts almost seemed to encourage the whispers of witchery, with their darkened house, their love concoctions and their crowd of black cats. All Gillian and Sally wanted to do was escape. One would do so by marrying, the other by running away.

In the males the white band has a single very small eyelet on each hindwing, sometimes showing a white pupil, while in the females it shows one or two ocelli.Papillons du Poitou-Charentes The underside of the forewings is rather similar to the upperside: The hindwings are marbled of brown and white with a broad white band. The white band on the internal edge of the underside hindwings is curved, while the white band on the underside forewings is often without a significant indent.Euro Butterflies by Matt Rowlings The colouration and pattern of these butterflies are an excellent camouflage on the bark of the trunks where the butterfly usually rests, with the eyespots hidden by the closed wings. This species is similar but larger than Hipparchia hermione. It is also rather similar to Hipparchia syriaca and Hipparchia genava. The caterpillar has a pale brown head with four darker streaks.

History As an unrecognized Bedouin village, Arab al-Naim only received access to piped water for the first time in 1993, when the neighbouring Jewish village of Eshhar decided to help out by providing it. Eshhar also helped with some other projects including the construction of a kindergarten. By 1998 Eshhar started to work intensively with the village to help it achieve recognition. Arab al-Na’im’s Bedouin leader, Nimer Na’im, and Eshhar’s Jewish chairman, Yisrael Ne’eman, agreed a joint border between their lands that year, and a petition for the recognition of Arab al-Na’im as a permanent village was presented to the director general of the Ministry of Interior. Arab al-Na’im was recognised by the state in 2000, making it eligible for municipal services and bringing it under Misgav Regional Council. The two villages have continued to cooperate on planning and development. Since Arab al-Na’im has less land, their building permits allow houses of up to three stories as against Eshhar’s two. The two villages are quoted as considering they have established “good neighbour relations,” each retaining its identity and agreeing to disagree where necessary. Nelson, C. (2019). Israel Denial: Anti-Zionism, Anti-Semitism, & the Faculty Campaign Against the Jewish State. Indiana University Press. p. 176. By 2013, the village had a paved road system, along with other infrastructure worth some $20 million, with a new metaled access road constructed from a new roundabout at the entrance to the adjacent community of Eshhar finished by 2016. Following the institution of a master plan for the village, the first permanent masonry-built houses were constructed in the village in 2014, replacing wood and metal temporary shacks. By 2018 around forty new homes had been completed, transforming the village together with new sewers and roads.

It is needed at distribution level (wind parks, PV systems, distributed cogeneration, etc.) to prevent a short circuit at HV or EHV level from causing a widespread loss of generation. Similar requirements for critical loads such as computer systemshttp://www.powerqualityworld.com/2011/04/cbema-curve-power-quality- standard.html CBEMA Curve – The Power Acceptability Curve for Computer Business Equipment, 2011-04-03 and industrial processes are often handled through the use of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) or capacitor bank to supply make-up power during these events. General concept Many generator designs use electric current flowing through windings to produce the magnetic field on which the motor or generator operates. This is in contrast to designs that use permanent magnets to generate this field instead. Such devices may have a minimum working voltage, below which the device does not work correctly, or does so at greatly reduced efficiency. Some will disconnect themselves from the circuit when these conditions apply. The effect is more pronounced in doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG), which have two sets of powered magnetic windings, than in squirrel-cage induction generators which have only one. Synchronous generators may slip and become unstable, if the voltage of the stator winding goes below a certain threshold. Risk of chain reaction In a grid containing many distributed generators subject to disconnection at under voltage, it is possible to cause a chain reaction that takes other generators offline as well. This can occur in the event of a voltage dip that causes one of the generators to disconnect from the grid. As voltage dips are often caused by too little generation for the load in a distribution grid, removing generation can cause the voltage to drop further. This may bring the voltage down enough to cause another generator to trip, lower the voltage even further, and may cause a cascading failure. Ride through systems Modern large-scale wind turbines, typically 1 MW and larger, are normally required to include systems that allow them to operate through such an event, and thereby “ride through” the voltage dip. Similar requirements are now becoming common on large solar power installations that likewise might cause instability in the event of a widespread disconnection of generating units. Depending on the application the device may, during and after the dip, be required to: * disconnect and stay disconnected until manually ordered to reconnect * disconnect temporarily from the grid, but reconnect and continue operation after the dip * stay operational and not disconnect from the grid * stay connected and support the grid with reactive power (defined as the reactive current of the positive sequence of the fundamental) Standards A variety of standards exist and generally vary across jurisdictions. Examples of the such grid codes are the German BDEW grid codeBDEW Medium Voltage Guideline retrieved on 9 November 2008 and its supplements 2,BDEW MV Guideline 2nd Supplement retrieved in 07/2010 3,BDEW MV Guideline 3rd Supplement retrieved in 02/2011 and 4BDEW MV Guideline 4th Supplement retrieved in 12/2015 as well as the National Grid Code in UK.National Grid Code retrieved on 9 2008-11-9 Testing For wind turbines, the FRT testing is described in the standard IEC 61400-21 (2nd edition August 2008). More detailed testing procedures are stated in the German guideline FGW TR3 (Rev. 22). Testing of devices with less than 16 Amp rated current is described in the EMC standard IEC 61000-4-11IEC 61000-4-11 and for higher current devices in IEC 61000-4-34.

It stands on a prominent ridge above sea level, within the boundary of Pontypool Park, Torfaen in south Wales. It is considered to be the best surviving grotto in Wales. It is an important local landmark commanding views south towards the Severn Estuary. A little further along the same ridge can be found the Folly Tower. History The grotto was commissioned by John Hanbury as a hunting lodge/summerhouse in the late 18th century. The Hanbury family were local ironmasters who owned Pontypool Park. During the early 19th century, Capel Hanbury Leigh (6 Oct 1776 - 28 Sep 1861) undertook renovations of the family house and park's grounds and it is thought that his wife Molly Ann (married 14 Apr 1797, she was the widow of Sir Robert Humphrey Mackworth (died 1794)) was responsible for the interior shell decoration. Although there is no direct evidence that the shell interior was Molly’s invention, it is known that she was an avid collector of shells (and built another shell grotto near her home at Gnoll). The shell decoration within grottoes was common during the 19th century and it follows that Molly may have followed the trend and begun the work to place the shells in the grotto. The Hanbury family used the grotto for picnics during nearby shoots throughout the 19th century. During 1882 the then Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), is said to have picnicked at the grotto during a shoot. Construction The grotto is constructed of local red Pennant sandstone and conical stone tiled with a fan vaulted roof (with six fans rising from six pillars) and the supporting pillars and ceiling are covered with thousands of shells interspersed with minerals and real stalactites removed from caves in the local area. The interior walls are mostly bare stone, with some embedded calcite crystals. The floor incorporates animal bones and teeth forming arcs, circles, stars, hearts and diamonds. The two remaining windows contain coloured glass. Restoration During the 20th century the grotto began to fall into disrepair and by the early 1990s the building was beginning to suffer from the elements as well as vandals. The roof of the grotto had collapsed, and some of the outer walls were beginning to crumble. Public access to the grotto was stopped during the 1970s. Without renovation the grotto could have been lost totally. Initial reviews of the cost of renovating the property were very high and the local council sought external financial assistance. Although some minor restoration to the roof was undertaken in January 1992, the grotto continued to suffer and the external walls were quickly becoming a major issue. It was during 1992 and 1993 that the intervention of the Welsh Heritage Authority, Cadw, and the European Regional Development Fund, that enough donations were secured to cover complete restoration of the building. The exterior of the building was restored over eight months during 1993 and 1994 which included repairs to damaged stone work, renovation of the chimney, roof timber replacement, a new roof, a replacement door and new windows and shutters. The summer of 1994 saw completion of the exterior work, at a cost of £75,000. Although the exterior was now complete the magnificent shell interior was in complete disarray, due to the elements, the collapsed roof and vandals. In 1995 a campaign was begun to raise funds to match the local council’s resources to restore to former glories the interior of the grotto. Donations were secured once again from Cadw and from the Heritage Lottery Fund in Wales. Restoration of the shell interior commenced in 1996 and a specialist team of conservators - St Blaise Ltd. - did the restoration of the intricate plaster and shell work. Repairs to the ceiling, pillars, walls and floors took four months to complete. A photographic record had been taken of the shell interior some years earlier and this was invaluable in ensuring that the repairs were true to character. Many of the shells and minerals that had been dislodged had been stored away and these, together with replacement material, were used in the restoration process. British shells provide the majority of the shells used and include mussels, cockles, periwinkles and limpets, accompanied by a few examples of exotic species such as pearl oyster, conch and cowrie. The restoration of one of the finest shell grottoes in Wales was completed in December 1996, enabling residents and visitors to Pontypool to once again visit the grotto and enjoy the shell interior and panoramic views. The root work around walls and ceiling was riddled with worm. To stabilise these almost hollow structures a resin and solvent mixture was painstakingly injected into the holes with a hypodermic needle. When the solvent evaporated the resin hardened making the whole root solid. The rustic chairs were restored by piecing in new segments which were missing, repairing broken sections, and scraping back layers of modern paint. The chairs had originally been painted, the dull green colour being analysed under the microscope and dated to the middle 19th Century. With the new pieces of wood needing to be painted, it was decided to repaint all chairs in a specially mixed colour to match the original. Access and opening times Visiting the grotto involves a steep climb over uneven ground so access can be difficult. References * Pontypool Museum The Shell Grotto - Pontypool Park.

Her World War II career was short lived; however, after decommissioning, she was reactivated in 1962 for use as a research ship for the U.S. Bureau of Mines, where she served as Grass Valley.  Construction and career  Suncook was laid down at Portland, Oregon on 30 November 1944 by the Commercial Iron Works. The ship was launched on 16 February 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Laura B. Stephenson. Suncook was commissioned on 5 May 1945, Lt. Robert C. Ramey, USNR, in command.  World War II service  Suncook conducted shakedown and training off the California coast until 8 July, when she departed for Pearl Harbor. From there, she was routed on to Eniwetok Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean. She arrived at the anchorage on 1 August, just two weeks before the cessation of hostilities. There she tended nets for the next seven months, making one round-trip voyage to Ponape and back in December 1945.  Post-war service  In March 1946, she sailed to Guam in company with and after two weeks there, continued on to Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, where she arrived on 30 March. Suncook remained in the vicinity of Bikini and Kwajalein Atolls until September, supporting the atomic bomb tests known as Operation Crossroads. On 2 September, she cleared the area and sailed via Pearl Harbor to the U.S. West Coast. She reached Seattle, Washington, on 30 September and remained there until June of the following year, undergoing radiological clearance.  Post-USN service and disposition  In January 1947, she was placed in reserve, but remained in commission. On 10 June, she departed Seattle, and arrived, two days later, in Astoria, Oregon, where she was placed out of commission. She remained with the \\"mothball\\" fleet until August 1961, when custody was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration. In September 1962, she was again transferred, this time to the U.S. Bureau of Mines for use as a research ship at the Marine Mineral Technology Center at Tiburon, California.  Re-named Grass Valley  Her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1962 and she became the research vessel, Grass Valley. She served under that name until returned to the Navy for disposal on 18 June 1968. On 28 July 1971, her hulk was sold to the Waterman Supply Co., Wilmington, California.

Along with other prominent figures, including Hu Linyi and Guam Wing, Ma raised the Green Standard Army to fight against the Taiping Rebellion and restore the stability of Qing Dynasty. This set the scene for the era later known as the \\"Tongzhi Restoration\\"(). His assassination symbolized the serious conflict between the Xiang Army and Green Standard Army, both of which fought for the Qing Dynasty. Early life Born as a native of Heze, Shandong () in 1821, he had successfully passed the imperial examinations at the age of 26 (1847), a prestigious achievement in China. He had earned the Jinshi degree, the highest level in the civil service examinations, which led to his appointment to the Hanlin Academy, a body of outstanding Chinese literary scholars who performed literary tasks for the imperial court. Assassination Ma Xinyi was later appointed as the governor-general of Liangjiang, a region comprising the provinces of Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu in 1868. He proved to be an able administrator, distinguishing himself with his capability to manage tensions with foreigners. This was demonstrated when Ma Xinyi addressed the problem of kidnapping in his area, which effectively averted anti-foreign riots, particularly in the area of the Yangzi delta. Two years later, in 1870, Ma Xinyi was assassinated and his killer was immediately caught. The assassin was identified as Wan Qingxuan (Zhang Wenxiang), who was executed in the marketplace after a trial presided by Wan Qingxuan of Nanchang. Some sources state that he was the governor's former companion. Many historical rumours implicated the Empress Dowager Cixi in Ma Xinyi's death. This is aligned with the speculation that Ma Xinyi's assassination was due to the conflict between the imperial army and the Xiang militia, the group that played an important role in the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion.

Her aristocratic mother also joined it a few years afterwards, and made her novitiate under the guidance of her own daughter. In 1815, despite her relative youth and the drawback of a slight physical deformity, Mother de Gramont was placed in charge of the first school of the Sacred Heart, opened in Paris, Rue des Postes, afterwards transferred to the Rue de Varenne.

Glider automated and simplified actions by the user through the use of scripting to perform repetitive tasks while the user was away from the computer. This allowed the user to acquire in-game currency and level-ups of the character without being present to perform the required actions. As of 2008, it had sold approximately 100,000 copies. Glider was ultimately discontinued after a lawsuit was filed against MDY Industries by Blizzard Entertainment. Glider was featured in the 2018 documentary film Play Money and its creator Michael Donnelly was a speaker at DEF CON 19. MDY v. Blizzard While MDY Industries asserts that the software is meant to overcome design flaws in the World of Warcraft environment, Blizzard contended in a 2006 United States federal lawsuit that the program's use violated their terms of service. In July 2008, the court entered summary judgment holding MDY Industries liable for tortious interference and copyright infringement, based, in part, upon the legal premise that users of the World of Warcraft client software are licensees rather than owners of their copy of software. Public Knowledge, a public interest group which filed an amicus brief in the case,MDY Industries, LLC v. Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. et al., Amicus curiae brief of Public Knowledge in support of neither party on cross-motions for summary judgment (District of Arizona 2008). criticized the decision, saying it makes the loading into memory of legally obtained software an act of copyright infringement subject to high statutory penalties, if the user has violated the software's license agreement in any way. The court did not hold this view and found that Glider infringed upon Blizzard's intellectual property by making an illicit copy of the World of Warcraft client in order to avoid Blizzard's anti-cheating software, Warden, and ordered MDY Industries to pay Blizzard $6,000,000. In finding this, the court agreed with Blizzard that World of Warcraft is licensed, not sold. Following the judgment, Blizzard petitioned to enjoin MDY Industries from distributing Glider or releasing its source code. In March 2009, MDY Industries suspended Glider sales and operations pursuant to an injunction. On December 14, 2010, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling. They agreed that users were licensees rather than owners of the software. They changed the ruling on copyright, stating that users were in breach of contract concerning the end-user license agreement (EULA), but that this did not constitute a violation of copyright. Nevertheless, they ruled that the bot violated the DMCA. MDY requested that the case be sent back for review, but as of August 2011, the court had yet to hear or agree to any review. MDY's owner, Michael Donnely stated in a release on the official forums that given the manner of the ruling and the statements by the court, it was highly unlikely that MDY was going to be able to bring Glider back in any form. He stated that they were looking at their options, and that he would speak with the lawyers working the case, but due to the cost of the case it was not likely that there was much that they could do. By September 2011, mmoglider.com, the official \\"Glider\\" homepage, had vanished. As of February 23, 2012, Blizzard acquired the domain name mmoglider.com and it is currently redirecting to a Blizzard-owned website, worldofwarcraft.com. Blizzard Entertainment also acquired ownership of 4 MDY Industries trademarks, including the \\"Glider\\" word mark and the corresponding logo image marks. The trademarks were cancelled in 2015 by the United States Patent and Trademark Office due to Blizzard Entertainment not renewing them. The domain name and trademark transfers suggests that a settlement might have been reached between MDY Industries and Blizzard Entertainment.

She is managing director at SKDKnickerbocker, a strategic communications firm in Washington, D.C., and currently serves as a senior advisor to the presidential campaign of Joe Biden. Personal life and family Dunn was raised in Bethesda, Maryland, the daughter of Albert E. Babbitt and Carol Hutto Babbitt. Her father's brother was the modernist composer, Milton Babbitt. Dunn is married to Robert Bauer, former partner at Perkins Coie and former personal counsel to President Obama and the White House Counsel. Bauer was also the general counsel of Obama for America since January 2007. In 2008, Newsweek named Dunn and Bauer the new \\"power couple\\" in Washington, D.C. Career Dunn began her career in the Carter White House, first as an intern for White House Communications Director Gerald Rafshoon and then worked for chief of staff Hamilton Jordan. She worked on the campaign of U.S. Senator John Glenn (D-OH) in 1984, and on Capitol Hill before joining the firm founded by Bob Squier and William Knapp in 1993. She has been the adviser and communications director to Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ), and served as the chief strategist for his presidential campaign. Dunn also served as advisor to Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN), former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) and as communications director for Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000. In 2004, Anita produced the media for Congressman Lloyd Doggett (D-TX).Squier Knapp Dunn bio. Company Web site. Retrieved March 9, 2010. In 2006 she was hired by then-Senator Barack Obama to direct communications and strategy for his political action committee, The Hopefund. This move signaled to many that Obama was planning to run for the presidency. While advising Hopefund and Obama in 2006, she was instrumental in the preparations for the launch of Obama for America, and brought many key staffers to the Obama campaign with whom she had worked in Bayh's and Daschle's offices.  Obama campaign  In April 2008, it was announced that Dunn, who had joined the Obama campaign in February, would be the director of communications, policy and research operations for Obama for America, where she held the title Senior Adviser and was one of the major decision makers of the Obama campaign. She was featured as one of four top advisers (along with David Axelrod, David Plouffe, and Robert Gibbs) in a 60 Minutes interview held after then-President-elect Obama's November 4, 2008, victory speech at Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois. She was described, in the 60 Minutes interview, as, \\"a relative newcomer who handled communications, research and policy.\\"\\"Obama's Inner Circle Shares Inside Story\\". CBS. During the presidential transition of 2008-09, Dunn trained White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs.  White House Communications Director  Dunn served as interim White House Communications Director from April to November 2009. She took the lead in the Obama administration's criticism of the Fox News Channel.Horowitz, Jason. \\"Newly Out In Front for White House: An Ol' Pro: Interim Media Strategist Leads Salvo Against Fox\\", The Washington Post, October 14, 2009; accessed October 16, 2009 On Sunday, October 11, 2009, she appeared on CNN's Reliable Sources and was asked to discuss a statement she made to Time magazine regarding Fox News, \\"it's opinion journalism masquerading as news.\\" She responded by saying, \\"if you were a Fox News viewer in the fall election, what you would have seen would have been that the biggest stories and biggest threats facing America were a guy named Bill Ayers and something called ACORN. The reality of it is that Fox News often operates almost as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party.\\" She added, \\"And it's not ideological. Obviously, there are many commentators who have conservative, liberal, centrist, and everybody understands that. But I think what is fair to say about FOX and certainly the way we view it is that it really is more a wing of the Republican Party.\\" Dunn left her interim post at the end of November 2009 and was replaced by her deputy Dan Pfeiffer. After leaving the White House, Dunn rejoined SKDK. Although working for a lobbying firm, White House records show that Dunn maintained strong connections with the administration where visited over 100 times since her departure in 2009. At the same time the firm announced a “major expansion” emphasizing strategic communications and advocacy work for business. The firm added about a dozen Obama administration insiders as the firm's staff doubled in size. Among the major clients the firm took on were General Electric, AT&T;, Time Warner, and Pratt & Whitney. In particular, SKDKnickerbocker corporate clients have included such controversial companies as the for-profit Kaplan University and TransCanada Corp., the developer of the Keystone XL pipeline. At the same time that Kaplan Education hired SKDK to block Obama’s crackdown on predatory for- profit colleges, Dunn was known as “a close friend of President Obama.” The progressive social change organization CredoAction mounted a petition calling on Dunn to stop her work on behalf of TransCanada, calling it a \\"betrayal of the commitments that so many of us worked so hard for, and that Dunn herself played a huge role in shaping.\\" Another client, The Association of American Railroads (AAR), is also associated with oil pipeline infrastructure necessary to make ventures like the Keystone XL successful. SKD Knickerbocker helped AAR produce advertisements aimed at suppressing support for union workers. Other SKD Knickerbocker clients include a half-million subcontract from Paul Weiss Rifkind to lobby for Carlos Ghosn, the ousted Nissan CEO who was arrested in Japan and escaped in January 2020, New York City landlords and real estate associations resisting stronger rent protections for tenants, big food companies such as General Mills, Pepsi Co, Nestle, Kellogg, Viacom, and McDonalds in their fight to resist Obama-era nutritional standards for marketing foods to children, and Google and Pfizer in their campaign to cut taxes on foreign profits. Some of Dunn’s own clients at SKD Knickerbocker include pro-charter lobbying groups Students First and Families for Excellent schools. Knickerbocker produced ads urging citizens and legislators to support charter schools after Mayor Bill De Blasio blocked three charter schools from opening in buildings shared by existing public schools. Dunn also represented Amazon who sought PR help from SKD Knickerbocker as it developed plans to establish a second headquarters in New York City. Anita Dunn also personally partnered with Republican political advisor Greg Mueller to pitch PR strategies to hedge fund managers. This PR strategy aimed to give financiers a “home field advantage” by harnessing trusted local media sources and running a grassroots public affairs campaign aimed at increasing local confidence in the financial industry. As Dunn left her position as White House communications director, her husband Bob Bauer was named White House counsel. The White House granted Bauer a waiver to ethics rules intended to prohibit administration officials from working on issues affecting their former clients for two years. This exemption allowed Bauer to represent the White House, Obama's campaign, and Obama as an individual all at the same time. 2012 Obama campaign During the 2012 Obama campaign, Dunn helped Obama prepare for the debates. When Journalist Lee Fang asked Dunn if she felt it was “disingenuous” to advise Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign “while simultaneously being paid by a lot of corporations to lobby against his reforms” Dunn said in her response, “I work with some corporations because the fact of the matter is we’re in a democracy and there’s a dialogue and people have a right to be heard. And the fact of the matter is that most of the time when I work with people, they have a story to be told and we tell it.” Dunn’s logic echoes the theory of corporate personhood used to support judicial decisions like Citizens United in 2010. Harvey Weinstein Ahead of reporting in The New York Times about Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual abuse, Weinstein reached out to Dunn for public relations advice. Dunn told Weinstein \\"you should accept your fate graciously, and not seek to deny or discredit those who your behaviour has affected.\\" https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/nyregion/harvey- weinstein-bezos-bloomberg-aniston.html Dunn's firm stated that she was not paid for this, \\"was asked to speak with him by a friend\\" and that Weinstein was not a client of hers.https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stevenperlberg/former-obama-adviser- anita-dunn-helped-harvey-weinstein 2020 Biden campaign Dunn was hired as a senior advisor to Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign in 2019 to assist with communications strategy. After Biden's disappointing fourth place finish in the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses, Dunn was elevated to a more senior position managing overall campaign strategy, personnel, and finances. Dunn's prior association with Weinstein has reportedly created serious friction with former Bernie Sanders progressive staffers as the two teams look to defeat Donald Trump in the general election.https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/03/staffers-lash-out-in-bernie- world-meltdown-299545 Controversy Dunn said \\"The third lesson and tip actually comes from two of my favorite political philosophers: Mao Tse-tung and Mother Theresa\\".

She wants to know about her mother Angie Baker (Ally Sheedy), who abandoned her when she was a baby. She decides to go visit her mother in Tennessee despite her grandfather's insistence against it, leaving him a note. When she arrives at the trailer where her mother lives, she is greeted by her mother's partner Ray Wilcox (Don Diamont) who is attracted to her the minute he meets her. He keeps complimenting her using superficial charm until one night she goes out to dinner with him. He gives her too much champagne before taking her to an abandoned trailer on the same lot that her mother Angie and Ray live on and rapes her. After the rape, Emma returns home to her grandfather, who threatens to murder Ray, only barely being talked out of it by Emma. Emma soon finds out that she is pregnant and after some contemplation, she decides to keep the baby. However, Ray begins stalking her, which in turn causes her to go into labor and she gives birth to a son named Matthew Baker. Ray sues for sole custody of their son, easily winning the case due to his age and financial income, but Clayton kidnaps the baby. After becoming a fugitive, the police arrive at Emma's house along with Ray to get the baby. Emma tells them she doesn't have the baby and after persistent questioning and threats from Ray, they leave. Clayton is assisted by various friends while on the run, including a minister. Clayton is forced to come out of hiding and seek a hospital when the baby's health starts to decline causing him to stop breathing. He is eventually found and Emma wins the custody fight on appeal and Clayton is granted custody of the baby. Ray comes back and tries to talk to Angie, but Clayton sends him away.

Early life Born out of wedlock, Courlander was adopted by Lithuanian Jewish businessman Leonard Henry Courlander (1878–1970) and Edith Cater (1898-1970), who sent him to boarding school. When he was 19, his parents divorced and he was sent to live and work on a coconut plantation owned by his father in the New Hebrides in the South Pacific. His mother married Frederick Bohne in 1933 and eventually moved to New Zealand in the 1950s where she died in 1958. His father remarried Gwendoline Elmes and moved to Sydney, Australia. In November 1938, Courlander arrived in New Zealand and found work as a clerk with the Land and Income Tax Department in Wellington. On 10 April 1939 he was arrested and convicted and sentenced to 9 months imprisonment for breaking and entering a Napier house of Kathleen Reeston with John Matterson and Geoffrey Keen.\\"RATHER SERIOUS\\", Auckland Star, Volume LXX, Issue 85, 12 April 1939, Page 10Arrest of witness, New Zealand Herald, Volume LXXVI, Issue 23357, 27 May 1939, Page 15 Courlander and Keen's sentences were reduced on appeal to 18 months probation from 14 June 1939.Appeals succeed, Evening Post, Volume CXXVII, Issue 138, 14 June 1939, Page 9 Courlander held that his reason for going to the house was for a meal and that this was at Keen's invitation.Entering a house, Evening Post, Volume CXXVIII, Issue 17, 20 July 1939, Page 22 Courlander moved to Auckland on 30 September 1939 and married Joan Beryl Marchand there. Military life - Allies=New Zealand Army On the outbreak of war, Courlander was enlisted into the New Zealand Military Forces. Because of his knowledge of French and German he was placed in the Intelligence Corps. He sailed for Egypt on RMS Orion and served in Greece with the 18th Battalion. In December 1940 he was promoted to Lance-Corporal. At Kalamata, Greece on 29 April 1941 he was captured and interned in Stalag XVIII-D at Maribor in Yugoslavia. Prisoner-of-war As a prisoner of war, Courlander acted as an interpreter at the camp. He joined work parties in Austria and eventually in September 1943 was sent to Genshagen camp (Stalag III-D/517) in Berlin. Courlander posed as a “White Russian émigré” and claimed to have extreme anti-Soviet views. He participated in Nazi broadcasts to the United Kingdom. Military life - Germans=British Free Corps Subsequently, the Germans recruited Courlander in January 1944 for the British Free Corps. He was one of the original six members. Although the name 'Leonard Courlander' appears in some records in connection with the British Free Corps, the actual member appears to be Roy Courlander. Along with Thomas Cooper, he is said to have forcibly recruited British and Dominion POWs for the British Free Corps. By April 1944 he was promoted to Unterscharführer (sergeant). At his court martial, statements were made that Courlander was seeking to oust John Amery and take control of the Corps.Alleged Help To Germany, The Times (London, England), Tuesday, Oct 02, 1945; pg. 2; Issue 50262 Courlander and another man, Francis Maton, left the BFC by volunteering for service with the war correspondent unit SS-Standarte Kurt Eggers, which was operating on the Western Front. Their ultimate goal was to make for the Allied lines at the first chance. Courlander and Maton removed all of the BFC insignia from their uniforms, replacing them with the standard SS patches and rank. The two men boarded a train for Brussels in the company of a Flemish Waffen-SS unit. On 3 September 1944, the two men arrived in Brussels, where they linked up with the Belgian Resistance. They participated in street fighting against the Germans, with Courlander being wounded during action. The following day, they gave themselves up to a British officer, thus becoming the first two BFC men to be arrested. After capture Courlander was interviewed by British military intelligence, probably MI5. He told them that Adolf Hitler had told BFC members that if Britain was defeated, the former King Edward VIII would replace George VI on the throne and Oswald Mosley would become the Prime Minister. Courlander also provided background information on the formation of the BFC.MI5's Report on the British Free Corps (BFC) dated 27 March 1945. Court martial and imprisonment Lance Corporal Courlander was arrested and tried by court martial by the New Zealand military authorities in Westgate-on-Sea near Margate in Kent, England. On 3 October 1945, six years to the day after enlisting, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison on a charge of \\"voluntarily aiding the enemy\\". Prosecuting officer Lieutenant-Colonel R.A.L Hillard said that Courlander produced a series of propaganda talks designed to show how the British had failed to keep to pledges after the First World War and Trooper J.E. Wilson gave evidence that Courlander had told him he was trying to persuade the Germans to allow a corps of free British to fight the Russians. Courlander pleaded not guilty to the charge and stated that he had joined the BFC to facilitate escaping, but as that did not eventuate had sought to find a way to control and use the unit against the Germans.Aid To Enemy Denied, The Times (London, England), Wednesday, Oct 03, 1945; pg. 2; Issue 50263 In 1946, Courlander was transferred to Mount Eden Prison in Auckland. Because the court martial did not dismiss him from the Army Courlander was still entitled to wear his New Zealand Army uniform when out of prison for medical treatment, which he did in May 1946.Traitor still wearing uniform he disgraced, The Courier-Mail, Brisbane, 31 May 1946, page 4 His wife died while he was in prison. He appealed against his sentence, and in May 1950 it was reduced to 9 years. He was released on 2 October 1951 and married Margaret Spence the same day.Wants to meet his detractors, Townville Daily Bulletin, Townsville, Australia, 5 October 1951, page 6 Later life Courlander obtained a job working for a business directory company and during the late 1950s was involved in the New Zealand Social Credit Political League. He moved to Australia during the 1960s to start a new life, divorcing his wife in 1968. He ended up in a small industrial town of Lethbridge Park, near Sydney, which at the time was home to many serving and former soldiers. He died in Australia in 1979.

Biography Forbes grew up on the family farm in Berwickshire and is the sixth generation of Forbes to have lived and farmed there. He qualified as a livestock auctioneer and went from an employee at Wooler Auction Mart (in Northumberland) to the owner of the business and site, subsequently turning it into the biggest livestock auction mart in the United Kingdom. At the time the business encompassed various other livestock auction mart sites including Tyneside Auction Mart in Newcastle upon Tyne. Forbes eventually sold the livestock auction business to John Swan PLC, where he remained as a director until the business was acquired by H&H; Group PLC in 2015. In the 1980s, Forbes was invited to join the Newcastle United board of directors as it aimed to appease fan discontent by appointing a number of local businessmen. Forbes was a Newcastle United supporter from his early years and attended games throughout the country from his late teens. He moved from director to vice- chairman and finally chairman at Newcastle in 1990.Cassidy, Denis (2012) Newcastle United: The Day the Promises Had to Stop, Amberley Publishing, He chaired the club during an extremely difficult period for no salary and no financial gain and was chairman during the takeover by Sir John Hall in 1992. After the takeover and his resignation as chairman in 1992, Forbes declined the opportunity to become a shareholding member of the new board of directors as he believed that Hall's interests were financial and not those of a Newcastle United supporter. It is rumoured that Hall had not been to a Newcastle game before his interest in purchasing the football club. Forbes was appointed chairman of British Cereal Exports (BCE) in 2006, a post he held until 2013.\\"BCE Chairman George Forbes looks back at over 12 years in the export industry \\", fieldandrurallife.com, 12 November 2012.

The males are 19–21 mm. Description in Seitz P. hiera F. (45 d). Above very similar to the next species, maera, but always black- brown, of the colour of the darkest maera form , the forewing less pointed, with straighter distal margin; on the underside of the forewing the russet- yellow distal band does not extend without interruption to the anal angle, but stops at the lower median vein or is there interrupted. The apical ocellus, moreover, has less often a double pupil, being mostly quite circular and not always accompanied by a small accessory eye-dot (towards the apex), as is nearly always the case in maera. Besides, hiera is usually of lesser size than the smallest maera, and the black markings, which are very similar to those of maera, shine through on the completely darkened upperside. In the higher mountains of Southern Europe: the Black Forest, Alps, Carpathians, Apennines, and the Balcan; also in Asia Minor, the mountains of Central Asia, the Altai, and the Kentei Mts.

The company was the major theatrical enterprise of its era and featured some of the leading actors of their generation — Richard Burbage, John Lowin, and Joseph Taylor among other — and some leading clowns and comedians, like Will Kempe and Robert Armin. The company benefitted from the services of William Shakespeare, John Fletcher, and Philip Massinger as regular dramatists. The actors who performed the plays have left the most evidence of their lives and activities; but they were supported by musicians and other functionaries, and were enabled by managers and financial backers like Cuthbert Burbage. For more information on specific individuals, see individual entries: Robert Armin, Christopher Beeston, Robert Benfield, etc. Terms * \\"Sharer\\" -- an actor who was a partner in the company and so received a share of the profits, as opposed to a simple \\"hired man\\" who earned a wage. * A \\"householder\\" or \\"housekeeper\\" was an investor and sharer in one (or both) of the two theatres used by the troupe, the Globe and the Blackfriars. (The term \\"lessee\\" is also used, since the Globe was built on leased land and the Blackfriars facility was also leased. Partners in the theatres were partners in the leases.) The two theatres were organized separately from the acting company; actors could rise to be \\"sharers\\" in the company without being householders in the theatres, and some householders were not actors. * \\"Necessary attendant\\" refers to the hired men on Sir Henry Herbert's list (dated 27 December 1624) of 24 \\"musicians and other necessary attendants\\" of the King's Men who could not be arrested or \\"pressed for soldiers\\" without the consent of the Master of the Revels or the Lord Chamberlain. * \\"Principal actor\\" -- The First Folio provided a list of 26 \\"principal actors\\" in Shakespeare's plays, down to 1623. The list includes only sharers in the company, and omits hired men. * S.D.S. -- The Seven Deadly Sins, probably by Richard Tarlton. A production c. 1591 involved a group of players who would later go on to form the Lord Chamberlain's Men. After 1642 Twice in 1648, in January and December, different groups of former King's Men tried to re-activate the troupe, despite the formal prohibition on play-acting by the Commonwealth regime. The January endeavor involved Benfield, Bird, Clark, Hammerton, Lowin, Pollard, and Robinson (all of whom signed the dedication to the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio in 1647, along with Allen, Swanston, and Taylor). The December effort was by Baxter, Blagden, Burt, Clun, Cox, Hall, Kettleby, Loveday, and Charles and William Hart.The December effort was still producing litigation as late as 1661; Milhous and Hume, p. 487 and ff. Neither effort was successful, though groups of King's Men personnel were arrested at least twice in 1648 and 1649 for clandestine acting. When the King's Company was formed in 1660, the troupe included Loveday, Clun, Burt, Blagden, Bird, Baxter, and Charles Hart. Personnel * John Adson -- musician (cornet).

He is perhaps identical with Menmaatre-Setepenamun Gatisen known from Nubian sources. Titles *Horus name: Kanakht Merymaat (\\"Mighty Bull who loves Equity\\") *Nebty name: Wer-menu-em-per-itef-Amen-en-nepet (\\"Whose monuments are great in the house of his father Amun in Napata\\") *Golden horus name: Ir-sankhy-rekhyu (\\"Who vivifies the rekhit people\\") *Prenomen: Menmaatre Setepenamun (\\"Re is one whose equity endures, chosen one of Amun\\") *Nomen: Gatisen (Aktisanes) Gatisen had a Ramesside-style titulary. His throne name Menmaatre-Setepenamun is the same as the throne name of Ramesses II. Aktisanes' Horus name Kanakht-merymaat is the same as the Horus name of Ramesses II (and Osorkon II and Shoshenq III). This is a second reason why he is placed by some scholars around 300 BC.László Török, The kingdom of Kush: handbook of the Napatan-Meroitic Civilization It had been assumed that in the fourth century BC, there was a Ramesside revival in Nubia. Other researchers have pointed out that the reading of the name Gatisen is uncertain. They place the king before 700 BC and assume that there was no Ramesside revival.Robert G. Morkot: The Black Pharaohs, Egypt's Nubian Rulers, London 2000, S. 146-147, Monuments and inscriptions His longest text is a now lost building inscription copied by the Lepsius expedition in Nuri, but only published in 1977. The text was only partly preserved. It once most likely adorned a door at a temple in Napata. The names of the king are not preserved, most importantly the nomen Gatisen is missing.K.-H. Priese: Eine verschollene Bauinschrift des frühmeroitischen Königs Aktisanes(?), In: E. Endesfelde (edit.): Ägypten und Kusch, Berlin 1977, p. 343-67 The other inscription is to be found on two adjoining blocks, showing the king in front of Amun-Re- Horachte-Atum. The blocks were found at the Jebel Barkal. In this inscription the throne name and the nomen of the king are preserved, but the nomen Gatisen is difficult to read. The same holds true for a doorjamb from the same place providing the full titulary of the king, but with the nomen only partly preserved.Khartoum 5225 The name Gatisen has been identified with Aktisanes, known from the Greek historian Hecataeus of Abdera. This identification is not certain, especially because the reading of the name as Gatisen is uncertain. Hecataeus describes Aktisanes as an enemy of the Egyptian king Amasis. This seems unlikely as the earlier Nubian kings are well-known. Therefore and for other reasons it is in general assumed that Hecataeus chose the name of a contemporary Nubian king as he composed his more fictional story. Burial Aktisanes was buried at Jebel Barkal. He is thought to have been buried in either pyramid 11 or pyramid 14.László Török, The kingdom of Kush: handbook of the Napatan-Meroitic Civilization  References  Literature  * Laszlo Török, in: Fontes Historiae Nubiorum, Vol. II, Bergen 1996, 511-520, Category:4th-century BC monarchs of Kush Category:3rd-century BC monarchs of Kush Category:Kings of Kush ","title":"Aktisanes"},{"id":"18714025","text":"The 628th Tank Battalion was an armored battalion of the United States Army active during the Cold War, formed in 1946 and merged into the 103rd Armor Regiment in 1959.

It is found in the northern parts of both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans.  Distribution  The common sunstar is distributed from the Arctic down to the English Channel, in the North Sea, also on both East (from the Arctic to the Gulf of Maine) and Pacific coasts (from Alaska to Puget Sound) of North America. It is also circumboreal, found in Greenland, Iceland, the Barents Sea, Kola Bay, Okhotsk Sea and the White Sea.  Habitat  The common sunstar is commonly found on rocky bottoms, coarse sand and gravel in the bathyal, infralittoral and circalittoral zone (from low-tide line up to depths of 300 m). It seems to prefer areas of high water movement. Very small sunstars are sometimes found in rock pools.Ocean Eye  Description  It is reddish on top with concentric bands of white, pink, yellow, or dark red, and it is white on the underside. It is covered on top with brushlike spines, with the marginal spines somewhat larger. The thick, central disc is fairly large. This central disc has a netlike pattern of raised ridges. The mouth area is bare. It has relatively short arms which usually number eight to fourteen. Its radius can be up to 15 cm (6 inches). The madreporite plate stands out clearly.  Food  The common sunstar is an omnivore. It will eat almost anything including smaller starfish and sunstars, swallowing them whole. It is also a scavenger.

She was also a companion to Saint Teresa of Ávila and she led the establishment of new monasteries of in France and the Lowlands. Anne sometimes struggled with her superiors as she set about setting new convents and holding her position as a prioress while later settling in the Spanish Netherlands where she opened a house and remained there until she later died. She was a close friend and aide to Saint Teresa of Ávila and the saint died in her arms in 1582. Her heroic virtue received confirmation from Pope Clement XII on 29 June 1735 who titled her as Venerable while Pope Benedict XV beatified her on 6 May 1917. Life Ana García Manzanas was born in Almendral de la Cañada on 1 October 1550 as the seventh child to Ferdinand García and Maria Mancanas. That date of her birth she was also baptized in the parish church of His Holiness the Savior. Together with her three brothers and three sisters she was raised to be close to God which she learnt from her pious parents. The entire household - on a frequent basis - attended Mass and recited rosaries together. Her father had a priest teach the children the doctrine of the faith while her mother opened their home to the poor and adopted orphans to raise as her own. In her childhood she loved the paintings that depicted the Passion of the Lord, and she wanted to be associated with his suffering, so she gave her food to beggars and often walked barefoot along stone paths. In 1559 her mother died, and in 1560 her father died in that she described as being flung into her \\"deepest affliction\\". When she was of the proper age her older siblings wanted her to enter into marriage, though in her heart she desired to become a religious. Her older brothers tried to test her will through giving her the difficult task of sharing the work of the laborers at the fields in the hopes that she would renounce her calling. Once her brothers did this she started avoiding speaking to men and giving them the chance to speak to her so as to defend herself from marriage since she wanted to be married to God. The brothers felt that she was too tenderhearted to live in the austere mode of life in a monastic life, and they thought that she would join but would soon leave and thus burden the household with dishonor. Anne experienced visions and apparitions that made her unwilling to give up her dream, though on one occasion had a frightful apparition of a giant demon that scared her to the point of illness. Her relatives became quite concerned for her wellbeing and so took her to a hermitage dedicated to Saint Bartholomew to make a novena. Once Manzanas arrived outside the hermitage she was at once seized with paralysis and when her relatives carried her in - and not long after entering - she found herself cured of this sudden affliction. Anne later entered the convent on 2 November 1570 as a secular member of the Discalced Carmelites, the first secular that the foundress Teresa of Ávila accepted; she later made her religious vows on 15 August 1572. For the next decade she filled the post of an infirmarian. Once Teresa broke her left arm at Christmas in 1577 she became her almost inseparable companion and caregiver as well as an aid; it was she in whose arms Teresa died at Alba de Tormes on 4 October 1582. The nun made a short visit to Madrid after her friend's death. Following the death of the foundress, she returned to Ávila and took part in the foundation of a convent at Ocana (1595) while she was one of the seven nuns selected for the introduction of the order into the Kingdom of France on 15 October 1604. The French superiors - desirous of sending her as a prioress to Pontoise - obliged her to pass from the state of a secular religious to that of a choir nun. So unusual a step met with the disapproval of her companions but, as the foundress had once foretold, she offered no resistance. Anne had also been forewarned that the same step would cause her great sufferings. Her priorship at Pontoise was from January to September 1605, and she later acted in that role in Paris from October 1605 to April 1608. Her priorship also took her to Tours from May 1608 to 1611, all of which brought her great trials, not the least of which were differences with her superiors. The expiration of her last term of office saw her return to Paris, though she was warned in a vision and so proceeded to the Flanders in October 1611. There she founded and became prioress of a convent in Antwerp on 27 October 1612 which she governed to the end of her life. Another source attributes the leadership of the Antwerp convent to her follower Anne Worsley. Twice she was instrumental in delivering the town from the hands of Protestant forces. Anne died on 7 June 1626. Works Her writings include a number of letters that are still preserved as well as a biographical account now at Antwerp which Marie Dominique Bouix edited; there are also several treatises on spiritual matters which appeared at Paris in 1646. Beatification The beatification process culminated on 29 June 1735 after Pope Clement XII confirmed that Anne lived a life of heroic virtue and named her as Venerable. Two miracles attributed to her were investigated, and their approval would lead to her beatification: * The first miracle concerned the miraculous cure of Father Leopold of Saint John the Baptist from chronic cerebral abscess coupled with meningitis. * The second miracle concerned the 1633 cure of the Queen of France Maria de' Medici from a prolonged and severe bout of typhoid fever. The general committee for the Congregation for Rites - with the pope present to observe - took a vote on both miracles and approved them both in their session on 30 January 1917 while Pope Benedict XV later approved them both on 25 February 1917. Benedict XV beatified Anne in Saint Peter's Basilica on 6 May 1917. The current postulator for this cause is the Discalced Carmelite priest Romano Gambalunga.

This can be achieved by licensure, through barring entry to all except those who have passed certain entrance examinations and grades of training, or by allowing entry only to those who have gained membership of a specific professional body. What this means in practical terms, is that an architect or physician, for example, will firstly be a university graduate in their main subject, second, will have passed entrance examinations to join a recognised professional body and thirdly, will also be licensed to practise medicine or architecture, usually also obtained through sitting examinations. Therefore, such professions are open only to those who satisfy these requirements and are closed to everyone else. It is thus illegal for any other person to practice medicine or to pose as an architect. The origin of this process is said to have been with guilds during the Middle Ages, when 'professionals' fought for exclusive rights to practice their trades as journeymen, and to engage unpaid apprentices.

First established in 1962 as a fellowship of expatriate workers in the Emirate of Dubai, it now comprises more than 1,000 people from over 50 nationalities.  History = 1970–1990  In 1977, as more expatriate Christians came to Dubai, the small fellowship constituted itself as a church, called the International Evangelical Church of Dubai. A pastor was called, and a statement of doctrine was adopted. In the following year, the first constitution was accepted. The church was then meeting on Sundays in the Jumeirah American School (now the American School of Dubai), and Sunday School was held there in the afternoons. In 1980, due to international tensions, the church was asked, for security reasons, to leave the Jumierah American School. For a while the church met in hired hotel rooms and later in Our Own English School and The Cambridge High School, by arrangement with the school’s owner, Mrs. Varkey.  1990–2000  In 1990, the church leased a large Arabic style villa in Jumeirah (the “Jumeirah Villa”), which remained the church home until September 2003, and continued thereafter to be used for Sunday evening services and other churches’ meetings until the Dubai Municipality ordered the villa’s closure in June 2006. With the Villa as a permanent place of worship, the church grew significantly. Most notably, in 1990 a Friday morning service was started by 4 families, which grew to become the main gathering of the church. The Villa was also used by other Christian groups, including the Arabic Evangelical Church of Dubai (AECD). In 1994, an informal group composed of UCCD and AECD and others applied for a grant of land from the Ruler of Dubai on which to construct a church building. The Ruler of Dubai in 1998 granted a piece of land to these churches, and fundraising commenced for a building.  2000–present  In September, 2003, the Friday services commenced at the new Dubai Evangelical Church CentreDubai Evangelical Church Centre website (“DECC”) in Maranatha Hall. By 2009, six years after DECC was constructed, the total cost of construction had been covered (primarily by members of UCCD) and all loans repaid. DECC includes large prayer halls, smaller meeting rooms, a library and an outside pool for baptisms. It is located within a compound alongside church buildings of other denominations. In 2010 UCCD sent out a number of members and staff to establish a sister church, Redeemer Church of Dubai,Redeemer Church of Dubai website on the opposite side of Dubai. UCCD continued to support Redeemer Church of Dubai financially until 2012, by which time it had grown into a self-supporting church. Although licences to hold Christian worship or build churches in Dubai are restricted, UCCD's pastor joined other Christian leaders in 2011 to express their gratitude to the Government for their freedom to meet.

The Roman name for the fort was Fanum Cocidi (as recorded in the Ravenna Cosmography), and means 'The Shrine of Cocidius', a deity worshipped in northern Britain. The remains of the fort are situated at the village of Bewcastle, Cumbria, to the north of the Roman fort at Birdoswald, on Hadrian's Wall. The fort was identified as Fanum Cocidi on the basis that, of nine altars discovered on the site, six are dedicated to the god Cocidius. Description The fort was unusual for a Roman fort, being an irregular hexagon rather than oblong, and occupied the whole of the small plateau on which it stood. It occupied an area of almost . The fort was connected to Banna by a Roman road known as the Maiden Way. Two stone signalling towers have been discovered between the two forts (at Barron’s Pike and Robin Hood’s Butts), and it is believed that these were used to pass on signals from Bewcastle to Birdoswald. It is believed that the fort was built at about the same time as the forts on Hadrian's Wall, and that it was originally built with turf defences and timber buildings, but with gates and headquarters of stone. During the Antonine period, the turf ramparts were faced with stone. It was later completely rebuilt in stone. There were gateways to the north, south, east and west, the west gateway being the main one. The commandant’s house (praetorium) was in the approximate centre of the hexagon, with the headquarters (principia) to the immediate north of it. A Hadrianic-style bathhouse was situated in the south-east section of the fort. Building inscriptions found at the site indicate that detachments from at least three legions were involved in the building of the fort, the Second Legion (stationed at Caerleon in Wales), the Sixth Legion (based in York) and the Twentieth Legion (based in Chester). The fort was largely destroyed in A.D. 343, when Hadrian’s Wall was overrun. It was subsequently rebuilt but was finally destroyed after the barbarian invasion of A.D. 367 and was abandoned. Garrison The second-century garrison was the First Cohort of Dacians, a thousand-strong infantry unit. The third-century garrison is believed to be the first Cohors I Nerviorum (part-mounted). Excavations Limited excavations were carried out in 1937, 1954 and 1957. These established the positions of the internal buildings and uncovered several altars. Current site The embankments and ditches of the fort can still be seen. A church and churchyard occupy the southern part of the site, and the churchyard contains the famous Bewcastle Cross. To the north-east of the site are the remains of Bewcastle Castle, a Norman castle built in about 1092, using stones from the Roman fort. The castle was reputedly destroyed by Oliver Cromwell in 1641. NotesReferences * J.

Many consider it to be Tsukiyama's finest work, and an influential piece in Asian- American literature. The Samurai's Garden is often included in required reading lists for high school students, and is considered to be a prime example of using effective figurative language. Synopsis Twenty one year- old Stephen leaves his home in Hong Kong just as the Japanese are poised to further invade China, towards Hong Kong. He is sent to Tarumi, a small beach- side village in Japan, to recuperate from tuberculosis. There, he meets and develops friendships with three adults, Matsu, Kenzo, and Sachi, and a young girl, Keiko, who is his own age. Keiko becomes his first love, but it can't be because she is Japanese and he is Chinese. The Japanese and Chinese were fighting a war at that time, and Keiko's family had prejudiced opinions about Chinese people (especially Keiko's father). Yet Keiko still sees Stephen. Then Keiko's brother eventually dies fighting for Japan, and that causes Keiko to feel guilty for dating Stephen. She ends the relationship because of that. In addition, there is a bitter love triangle between Sachi, Kenzo, and Matsu. Sachi is now an old woman with leprosy. Lepers are forced into exile and are said to dishonor their family because of their disfigured bodies. Sachi says that society thinks of her as a monster, and these thoughts have obviously rubbed off on her self-concept. She always makes sure that no one can see the left side of her scarred face (the right side is unblemished and Stephen considers it the most beautiful face he has ever seen). Such beauty existing next to the scars shows that beauty is in everything. When Sachi was younger and \\"one of the most beautiful girls in Tarumi\\", she was engaged to Kenzo, a handsome boy who had promise for a great, successful future. But when Sachi got leprosy, Kenzo was too afraid to visit her in Yamaguchi because he didn't want to see what happened to her. He never realized it, but he had fallen in her love with her beauty, and not her soul. In order to keep in some contact in the later years with Sachi, Kenzo sent messages through his childhood friend, Matsu. Matsu is one of the main characters in this book and housed Stephen. Matsu was Stephen's grandfather's house keeper, and is a very understanding, quiet man. Matsu taught Stephen many lessons about honor, the cruelties of humanity, and what it is to love someone. Matsu was the only person who was truly there for Sachi, and over the years he and Sachi had started a simple, loving relationship. They attempted to have a child together, but it was stillborn. Also, Stephen's Baba (father) had an affair with a Japanese woman, and even gave money to his mistress. This tarnished Baba's reputation in Stephen's mind, and he felt betrayed by his father. Throughout the book there is an underlying sense of society being out place, what with their traditional ideas of honor and the fact that there was a war going on. The unwinding stories of his new friends, war, and family eventually bring him to the beginnings of wisdom, love, honor, and loss.  Themes  At the core, The Samurai's Garden is a novel emphasizing the intrinsic themes of loyalty and honor found in Japanese culture. The complex relationship between Tsukiyama's characters, and the physical adversities and conflicts they face, ultimately hold the significance for the title of the novel. The author also alludes to one's ability to build upon life rather than mere acceptance.

He played hurling with his local club O'Callaghan's Mills and with the Clare senior inter-county team from 1927 until 1936. Playing career=Club McInerney played his club hurling with his local club O'Callaghan's Mills and enjoyed some success. He won a senior county title with the club in 1937. He was the brother of Pa (Fowler) McInerney, also of O'Callahan's Mills, who won All-Ireland hurling championships with Clare and Dublin in the early 20th century. Inter- county McInerney first came to prominence for the Clare senior inter-county team in 1927 when Clare reached the Munster final. Cork provided the opposition on that occasion and went on to win the game by 5-3 to 3-4. 1928 saw Clare take on Cork for the second consecutive year in the Munster final. That year McInerney's side nearly pulled off a shock result, however, both sides finished level after recording 2-2. The replay was not a happy game for Clare as Cork trounced them by 6-4 to 2-2. Two years later in 1930 McInerney was back in the provincial decider. Tipperary were the opponents on that occasion, however, Clare failed to make the breakthrough once again. A score line of 6-4 to 2-8 gave victory to Tipp. In 1932 Clare reached the Munster final for the fourth time in six years. Once again, Cork, a team that had defeated McInerney's side on many occasions, provided the opposition. The game itself saw Clare triumph for the first time since 1914. A score line of 5-2 to 4-1 gave McInerney his first and only Munster medal. The subsequent All- Ireland semi-final was an exciting affair with Clare emerging victorious over Galway by 9-4 to 4-14. This victory allowed Clare to advance to the All- Ireland final where Kilkenny provided the opposition. In a low-scoring but tense game Clare’s Tull Considine scored two goals and was foiled for what would almost certainly have been a third. These goals were negated by Kilkenny’s three goal-scoring heroes Matty Power, Martin White and Lory Meagher. The final score of 3-3 to 2-3 gave victory to Kilkenny. Clare went into decline following this game as Limerick emerged as the dominant force in Munster. McInenrey retired from inter-county hurling in 1936.

He grew up in the town of Northwich in Cheshire and attended Charles Darwin Primary School, and later Hartford High School. He died in 2008, shortly after a racing accident when he fell and was struck by another motorcycle. Biography Born at Leighton Hospital Crewe, Cheshire, Jones grew up in nearby Northwich and remained there until later in his career he moved to Peterborough. Jones was a successful racer in the lower ranks of the British motorcycling ladder, winning the 1996 British Junior Mini-Moto Championship, the 1997 British Senior Mini-Moto Championship and the 2002 British Junior Superstock Championship before moving up to the British Supersport Championship. In 2003 and 2004, he rode a Daytona 600 in the British Supersport Championship, initially with teammate Jim Moodie in the Valmoto team run by experienced tuner/team manager Jack Valentine in conjunction with the Triumph factory, which returned to racing in 2003 after an absence of 30 years. Jones was retained by Valmoto as sole-rider for 2004, and finished the season with a win at the last round and in eighth position overall. In 2005 Jones has his best year in the British Supersport Championship riding for the Northpoint Honda team, achieving seven podium finishes and second overall in the title contest behind Leon Camier. Jones' riding that year earned him wildcard entry into the two British rounds of World Supersport, where he performed impressively. Jones qualified on the front row at Silverstone and was contesting the lead when he pulled out of the race with clutch problems, and he finished eighth at Brands Hatch. Jones was also called up as a stand-in rider for the prestigious Ten Kate Honda team at Brno, where he finished sixth. Jones moved up to the Superbike World Championship for the 2006 season on the uncompetitive Foggy Petronas FP1. A solitary thirteenth place at Imola was his only points finish in the championship. Jones in August 2008 In 2007, Jones returned to the Supersport World Championship category for his first season as a full-time supersport rider, riding with the Reve Ekerold Honda team. Jones suffered many technical problems early in the season, and crashed out of the lead at Brands Hatch, but a took podiums at Brno, and in the season's final two rounds Vallelunga and Magny-Cours. At Vallelunga he was leading when the red flag was thrown, but lost the race to Kenan Sofuoğlu as the Turkish rider was leading the last completed lap. The podium at Magny-Cours moved him up from 7th to 5th in the final standings. For 2008, Jones remained in Supersport, riding a factory supported Honda for the Portuguese-based Parkalgar Racing Team, with his team now managed by Simon Buckmaster, and added three more podiums including the season-opener at Losail and again at Valencia after an intense battle with Fabien Foret. Despite finishing off the podium at the Monza race, due to a severe hand injury caused in practice, and technical problems in the race at Brno (where he was at the front just two laps before the end), he was sixth in the championship before his ultimately tragic home round at Brands Hatch. Death Jones died as a result of head injuries sustained in a fall and subsequent collision during the Brands Hatch round of the 2008 Supersport World Championship season. The fall occurred at Clark Curve, a fast right-hand turn that leads into the home straight of the Brands Hatch circuit. At the time of the fall, Jones was in second position and challenging Jonathan Rea for the lead. As Jones accelerated out of the curve the rear wheel of his Honda CBR600RR lost traction and he was thrown across the track into the path of oncoming riders. The Australian rider Andrew Pitt attempted to take evasive action, but the front wheel and the footrest of his machine collided with Jones' helmet. The race was immediately stopped by officials so that medical personnel could attend to Jones, and he was taken to the Brands Hatch medical center where Clinica Mobile doctors resuscitated him on four occasions. He was air-lifted by the Kent Air Ambulance to the Royal London Hospital. Jones' condition was assessed as 'extremely critical' upon his arrival and he was induced into a pharmacological coma by doctors in an attempt to stabilise his condition. This intervention was unsuccessful and Jones was pronounced dead by doctors shortly after 00.30 local time on 4 August 2008. As Jones was running second in the race at the time of the race stoppage, he moved up to fifth in the championship. Fellow racers Tommy Hill and James Toseland were at his bedside as he died. Four-time world champion and former team boss of Jones, Carl Fogarty, said that \\"Craig was one of a crop of good young riders who were the future of British racing and I took a chance on him to ride for our team in 2006 because I thought he was the pick of the bunch.\\"Tribute to...Craig Jones Tributes The Autódromo Internacional do Algarve in Portimão, whose owners are also involved in Jones' Parkalgar Honda team, has named a corner on the track after Jones. British Superbike rider Cal Crutchlow raced in one of Jones' spare helmets at the BSB meeting at Knockhill a week later. On 14 March 2009, Eugene Laverty won for Parkalgar at Losail in World Supersport. His bike carried a small decal of Jones' #18, and in the post-race interview Laverty dedicated the win to Jones, crediting the work he had done in making the team competitive. On 17 August 2008, James Toseland rode the Czech Republic motorcycle Grand Prix with a black armband and carried Jones' number 18 on his fairing to express his sadness. On 7 September 2008 Tommy Hill rode Jones' bike around one lap of Donington Park in remembrance of his friend, while carrying the English flag. The marshalls also waved their flags. Craig Jones memorial at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve On 22 October 2009, a tribute ceremony occurred, with the exhibition of a provisional statue, created by the Portuguese sculptor Paula Hespanha, representing Craig Jones on his motorbike after passing the finishing line. This statue will be the main part of a monument, already partially built, which also includes the architectural arrangement of the main access roundabout to the racetrack, created by Paula Hespanha and Portuguese architect Manuel Pedro Ferreira Chaves. This monument is a landscape sculpture, representing the main straight of a racing circuit, which extends up to the car park of the main grandstand. This large-scale artistic intervention serves to frame the statue but will also be useful as an access that will allow pedestrian approach to the statue. The owner of Autódromo Internacional do Algarve and Parkalgar racing team, Paulo Pinheiro, declared: \\"it is a very special thanks to Craig Jones who will be forever immortalized in our memories. This tribute will keep alive the admiration and respect for the work of Craig in the motorcycling world \\". \\"This monument will ensure that Craig Jones will never be forgotten.\\" The inauguration of the marble and stainless steel statue was expected to occur in 2010. If completed in 2011, this will be the only stone statue in the world representing a motorbike.

It was introduced in 1964. History An early variant Neoplan Skyliner N122/3 Short wheel base version in Japan In 1964, the founder's second son, Konrad Auwärter, developed a double-deck design for a service bus as part of his dissertation. The 'Do-Bus' design had extremely low weight, and could carry over 100 passengers. It also featured a low-frame front axle with forward-mounted steering gear that permitted a low flat floor. The double-deck principle was applied to coach design, creating a revolutionary high-capacity comfortable vehicle for touring. This vehicle was known as the Skyliner, and created an image for the company that differentiated the Neoplan brand from its competitors, and created interest in its products across Europe. A second manufacturing facility opened in Pilsting in 1973, and a third opening in Kumasi, Ghana, in December 1974 to support a large order. The double-deck Skyliner concept was taken to its ultimate conclusion in 1975, with the introduction of the Jumbocruiser, a double-deck articulated coach long and high. The Spaceliner, introduced in 1979 took the Cityliner concept of passenger floor level above the driver, and extended the actual floor above the cab. This kept the height of the vehicle lower than a double-decker, at , but still allowed installation of toilets, kitchens or sleep cabins below the passenger compartment. Southern California Rapid Transit District of Los Angeles, operated Neoplan Skyliners during the 1980s and early 1990s. Antelope Valley Transit Authority operated Skyliners on their Lancaster-Los Angeles route during the late 1990s early 2000s. UK The Neoplan Skyliner also gained popularity in the United Kingdom. Stagecoach bought some Skyliners during the 1980s to facilitate its new coaching division developed during the company's early years. In 2004, it bought 25 more N122/3L Skyliners for its modern coaching divisions the Oxford Tube and Megabus. Trathens Travel Services of Plymouth also bought some Skyliners in 2005 for its National Express contracts. However, many of these were displaced following the accident with a National Express Skyliner (see below) - when some Plaxton Panthers were bought in 2007. Specifications (2009) The Neoplan Skyliner has undergone a process of evolution in specification since its 1964 introduction. , the double-deck Skyliner is available in two lengths: the Skyliner C and the Skyliner L. The shorter C version used to be long, but is now ; and the Skyliner L is long, and includes a correspondingly longer wheelbase. The Skyliner C is designed to seat 69 passengers plus two crew (driver and steward), whereas the Skyliner L seats 77 plus two. For the powertrain detail, current Skyliners use an MAN diesel engine sourced from Neoplan parent company MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG. This Euro4 rated diesel fueled internal combustion engine is the 12.5 litre MAN D2676 LOH 02 straight-six (R6) common rail turbodiesel with intercooler, which displaces , and utilises four valves per cylinder and cylinder-direct fuel injection. It uses a Bosch EDC7 electronic engine control unit, and also uses a 'PM-KAT' catalytic converter. It produces a DIN-rated motive power output of at 1,900 revolutions per minute (rpm), and generates a torque turning force of at 1,050-1,400 rpm. The engine is mounted upright in a longitudinal orientation at the rear of the coach, and transmits its output to the rear roadwheels via a twelve-speed TipMatic ZF AS Tronic automated manual transmission. An interesting design on the Skyliner is its 'tag' third axle. This is able to articulate, during steering movements - and this helps reduce tyre wear, which can afflict dual rear axle vehicles. It features disc brakes all round, and utilises independent suspension on the front and trailing third axles, whilst the driven axle is a solid version. Standard safety features include 'electronically regulated braking system' (EBS) with braking assistant (BA) and Electronic Stability Programme (ESP). It also features a speed-limiting device called 'maximum speed control' (MSC), and is fitted with an accident data recorder (ADR). An optional feature is the 'lane guard system' (LGS), which will vibrate the drivers seat should the coach drift out of its lane. Its maximum permissible weight is , and can have a total luggage volume of up to . {class=wikitable style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" !model!!internal combustion engine!!max. power @ rpm!!max. torque @ rpm!!transmission!!wheelbase!!length!!width!!height -valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"background:#E5E4E2;\\"Skyliner C (double-deck multi-axle)MAN D2676 LOH 02, R6 common rail turbodiesel @ 1,900 @ 1,050-1,40012-speed TipMatic ZF AS Tronic automated manual -valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"background:#E5E4E2;\\"Skyliner L (double-deck multi-axle)MAN D2676 LOH 02, R6 common rail turbodiesel @ 1,900 @ 1,050-1,40012-speed TipMatic ZF AS Tronic automated manual } Specifications (2017) The latest generation was introduced in 2011.

It has been the biggest bus accident in history of the Czech Republic. In May 2003 in France a Neoplan Skyliner overturned on a French highway, killing twenty-eight people. A report by French investigators recommended that drivers of double-deck coaches should receive special training because of the vehicle's relative instability. A separate study, presented to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in the same year reported that high-sided coaches were much more likely to overturn in crashes than standard single-deck coaches. The German manufacturer added a safety system, known as electronic stability control, which brakes each wheel separately to prevent overturning in 2006. In January 2007 a Neoplan Skyliner operated by National Express overturned and crashed on the M25 motorway near Heathrow Airport, killing two passengers; a third passenger died six-months later due to the injuries sustained in the crash. The company temporarily withdrew all twelve Skyliners from service pending investigations The crash was deemed to have been caused by travelling at excessive speed and the driver was charged with three counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He was subsequently jailed for five years and banned from driving for three years. No safety issues were found. The electronic stability control system which had been introduced on new vehicles in 2006 was not used on this vehicle.

The shooting took place in August and September 2007 in Allgaeu and in October 2007 in Tokyo. Short Synopsis The Japanese student Aki Onodera travels in her family’s tracks from Tokyo to Germany. In idyllic East Allgaeu she meets the Webers, who take her in as their guest. But soon, the situation of the family becomes turbulent by her appearance… Long Synopsis The young Japanese student Aki Onodera is haunted by dreams of long-lost memories from her early childhood. While she should really be concentrating on finding a job after her studies, instead she goes to her parents’ house and discovers an old package from a foreign land tucked away in a storage closet. An old camera containing film and a yellowed envelope with a letter and a map of a foreign country with a red spot marking a particular location seem to be the key to her dreams. Despite her parents’ and boyfriend’s apprehension, she travels alone to Germany to look for this place. On her search in the idyllic East Allgaeu area, she goes to the local police station looking for help, where the 18-year-old Elias Weber is being questioned. When Elias’ father comes to the police station to pick him up, the policeman asks him to take the Japanese girl with them, as the place she is looking for is near their house. Father and son drop Aki off near the edge of a forest and drive home. After dinner, Elias takes off with his sister to pick up his motorcycle from the police station and they run into the Japanese girl, who, drenched from the rain, is desperately looking for a place to stay for the night. They take her into town, and after not being able to find a hotel room, they take her back home with them and offer her their guest room. The next day, Elias helps Aki look for the location on the map where the red mark is. According to Aki, there is supposed to be a memorial stone there for Aki’s biological family, who died at that spot 18 years ago. Later on that evening, Elias gets into a hefty argument with his father which then turns physical. Elias runs out of the house, followed by his father who already has a guilty conscience about hitting his son. Although it is not her intention, Aki’s presence and the search for the past seem to intensify the tension among the Weber family and finally lead to light being shed on family secret. When Aki finally finds the spot she has been looking for, everyone involved must come to terms with the past in order to make way for a new beginning… Background Memorial stone for japanese family Tsuda near the site of the accident that inspired the script The script is based on real incident: Father, mother and daughter of the japanese family Tsuda were killed October 4, 1987 in a hit-and-run accident on Bundesstrasse 17, near the \\"Red Spot\\" shown on maps in the movie. Only the little son of the japanese family survived. The accident perpetrator fled the scene and was never found, the little boy grew up with japanese relatives. There is a memorial stone by the street where the accident once happened. The memorial stone shown in the film is a different stone, having the same text, but different dates and names on it.

It is adjacent to the Bedouin village of Arab al-Na'im, with which it shares an access road. History In 1979, a group of Jews in Chicago came up with a plan to establish a joint secular-religious community in Israel. Eshhar was established in 1986 by a gar'in comprising this group and other English- speaking and Israeli families. The community was named for the Rhamnus palaestinus (buckthorn), \\"eshhar\\" in Hebrew. Residents avoid driving within the village on Shabbat and public events are kosher. Beyond this, residents define their own lifestyles, without coercion. The local Tzofim scout group is open to both religious and secular youth.Youth Movement Village website Plans for a pluralistic Meguvan-affiliated elementary school failed due to legal issues and opposition from the Ministry of Education and the Regional Council.

Eshhar as a community, along with other Jewish organizations, have been involved in supporting Arab al-Na'im's leaders in obtaining state recognition and, subsequently, connection to municipal services and the institution of a master plan for the village, enabling the first permanent masonry-built houses to be constructed there in 2014.Nelson, C.

He is best known for the legend of his \\"lost treasure\\", allegedly located in the area of Solomonville, Arizona. Bill Walters was born in Fort Sill, in Oklahoma Territory. He worked most of his youth as a cowboy, then began working for the Santa Fe Railroad as a section hand. Shortly after becoming employed by the railroad, Walters became involved in train robberies and the robberies of stagecoaches. He began riding with the Black Jack Ketchum Gang around 1893, where he is believed to have committed at least two murders. He soon coaxed some of the gang members to leave with him, and form their own gang concentrating on the robbery of Wells Fargo shipments. It would be in this endeavor that he saw his greatest success. Between 1894 and 1897, Walters robbed an undetermined amount of cash from shipments, committing several murders in the process. The amounts he is believed to have stolen in legend are in all likelihood exaggerated. However, as the legend goes, Walters began hiding his loot in a secret location around Solomonville, near where he and his gang had their hideout. In July 1898, after a failed robbery attempt in Grants, New Mexico during which the gang was driven off by heavy gunfire by guards, lawman Jeff Milton, along with lawman George Scarborough, tracked down then shot and captured Walters, and scattered his gang from their hideout, killing another gang member in the process. George Scarborough is noted for having killed outlaw and former lawman John Selman, killer of John Wesley Hardin. Walters was convicted of his crimes, and sentenced to life in prison. Wells Fargo never recovered the stolen loot, which led to the legend. Walters was released from prison in 1917, and although it is not known for certain, he is believed to have never returned to Solomonville, possibly because there was, in reality, no \\"lost treasure\\" to recover. He settled in Hachita, New Mexico, a small ranching community, where he worked as a wrangler. He died on June 16, 1921 when he fell from a windmill while doing repairs.

This name evolved into \\"Joyliff's Hill\\" and then, on Henry Walter's Map of Windsor Forest, 1823, became \\"Jealous Hill\\". This changed again to \\"Jealot's Hill\\" on John Snare's 1846 map and by the 1920s the modern spelling was established. Syngenta research site Jealott's Hill House Hawthorndale House Jealott's Hill is home to Syngenta's largest research and development site which includes a large agricultural research greenhouse at and a farm. , Syngenta employed around 800 people there. The site was formed in 1927 by the amalgamation of three farms, Hawthorndale, Nuptown and Jealott's Hill itself. Jealott's Hill House was built in 1928 and officially opened on 28 June 1929 as the offices, laboratory and library of Imperial Chemical Industries's Agricultural Research Station; initially the research focused on nitrogen fertilizers in grassland management. In 1936, the Hawthorndale Biological Laboratories were opened in the converted mansion building of the former farm. Research there involved the biological evaluation of chemicals as potential pesticides. The site is now called Jealott's Hill International Research Centre. In 2007, the site was recognised by the Royal Society of Chemistry as a National Chemistry Landmark and awarded a blue plaque in recognition of 80 years of scientific research which led to global developments in agriculture.

He was also manager of the club with the Directors Committee from 1938–58 during three spells and at the helm when they won the FA Cup in 1951 and 1952. On behalf of his father's success, Seymour Jr. went on to the board of directors. By 1981 Newcastle United were heavily in debt, crowds were at an all-time low and the future looked very bleak. Arthur Cox had been brought in as manager but was having a tough time with the cash-strapped club, which was stuck in the second division under the unpopular chairmanship of Bob Rutherford, who was widely seen as being a puppet for the previous chairman, long-serving director Lord Westwood. Early in that year, the directors came up with a plan whereby they would donate £13,000 each to the club in order to get it out of debt. However, Westwood refused to go along with the plan and resigned from the board. This left Rutherford without any allies, and the remaining board members unanimously demanded that he resign, which he did. In March 1981, after a board reshuffle, Seymour Jr. emerged as the new chairman and immediately addressed United's shambolic finances. The first move was to slap an immediate spending freeze on manager Arthur Cox, at the same time shutting out a possible takeover bid by ambitious millionaire Ernie Clay. Then, in August 1982, Newcastle United announced a coup which astounded the footballing world, the first arrival of the player Kevin Keegan on Tyneside. Geordies went crazy when the then England skipper flew into Newcastle Airport. Keegan's £100,000 transfer fee from Southampton, which was found thanks to the help of Newcastle Breweries, transformed Arthur Cox's team into a winning formula, one that eventually took the club back to the First Division. In deals which eventually brought spending to £275,000 Keegan, Terry McDermott and David McCreery all arrived on Tyneside. With Peter Beardsley and Chris Waddle complementing Keegan as the Newcastle United spearhead, crowds in the ground reached an average of 30,000. United gained promotion in 1984 with Keegan retiring after the last match of the season and Arthur Cox resigning amid a contract row. Newcastle United now struggled on with a succession of managers, including Jack Charlton. Eventually the boardroom revolution steered by Sir John Hall removed Seymour Jr. from his position as chairman. He eventually became president of the club. He died in 1992 at Birmingham after attending a Newcastle United fixture, which they won.

In 1791 he returned to Buenos Aires where he became the secretary to the mayor of the Buenos Aires Cabildo. During the British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806 he fought as captain of the 1st Patricians' Infantry Regiment. After the reconquest of the city he joined the party of General Cornelio Saavedra.Fernández, p. 28 In 1810, he helped in the planning for the May Revolution as legal counsel to the Cabildo. He was part of the group of moderates which wanted the Cabildo to assume command of the government during the Napoleonic invasion of Spain, only to return it later to the Spanish Crown. Therefore, on May 22, 1810 he voted to depose the viceroy. The Primera Junta named him comptroller of the Auxiliary Army of Upper Peru with the rank of Colonel and in August 1810 he was named governor of Salta Province (which is now Jujuy Province). In November 1810 he received orders from Buenos Aires to leave his current post and assume a new post as the new governor of Potosí and in 1811 he returned to Buenos Aires and became a part of the First Triumvirate, along with Juan José Paso and Manuel de Sarratea. He was a triumvir until he was deposed on October 8, 1812. In November 1812 he was again named governor of Salta where he worked closely with Manuel Belgrano during the second Upper Peru campaign. He reported to the government of Buenos Aires since the people of Salta flew the modern flag of Argentina during the third commemoration of the May Revolution.Perazzo, p. 109 He remained governor of Salta until October 26, 1813 when he was succeeded by Francisco Fernández de la Cruz. Between 1814 and 1816 he was in charge of provisioning the Auxiliary Army of Upper Peru; In 1817 he was politically opposed by the Supreme director Juan Martín de Pueyrredón and was exiled to Baltimore in the United States of America. In 1818 he was allowed to return to Argentina, only to be exiled again, this time to Mendoza, but due to illness he was not able to make the trip. Finally, in 1819, retaining his rank of colonel, he was ordered on his last mission, to negotiate peace with the native tribe of the Ranquel. He managed to forge a peace treaty with the tribe. He retired from the army in 1822 and died in Buenos Aires in September 1826. He is interred in the La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

Early life Barney was born in 1808 at Henderson, New York, the son of John Barney (1775–1863) and Sarah (née Grow) Barney. His father was a farmer in Jefferson County, New York, when Danford and his younger brother Ashbel were born. He was a descendant of Jacob Barney of Bradenham, Buckinghamshire, England, who settled at Salem, Massachusetts, about 1630. Through his brother, he was uncle to Charles T. Barney, the president of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, the collapse of which shortly before Barney's death sparked the Panic of 1907.Robert F. Bruner and Sean D. Carr, The Panic of 1907. Lessons Learned from the Market's Perfect Storm, passim. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons, 2007. Career As a young man, Barney went to Sacketts Harbor, New York, where he was cashier in a bank. In 1842, Barney and his brother, Ashbel, went to Cleveland, Ohio, and engaged in business as forwarding and commission merchants as Danford N. Barney & Company. Barney resided in Cleveland at 24 Public Square and later 169 Euclid Street. In 1849, Barney moved to Buffalo, New York, where he was a commission merchant and proprietor of a bank. When Edwin Barber Morgan resigned as president of Wells Fargo & Company on November 26, 1853, Barney was elected to succeed him. He was also elected to the board of directors, of which he remained a member until 1870.Loomis, p. 42. In 1856, he moved to New York City. Besides serving as president and a director of Wells Fargo, Barney was also a director of John Butterfield's Overland Mail Company, organized in 1857 to provide government mail coach service from Tipton, Missouri, to San Francisco, California, by way of El Paso, Texas, and Yuma, Arizona.Loomis, p. 128.

Personal life On October 8, 1833, he married Cynthia Maria Cushman, daughter of Peter Newcomb Cushman and Sally (née Kellogg) Cushman. Before Cynthia died on August 5, 1843, the couple were the parents of three children: * Danford Newton Barney, Jr. (1835–1861), who married Sarah Elizabeth Brandegee and died at Irvington- on-Hudson, New York. * Sarah Maria Barney (1836–1910), who married the architect and art critic Russell Sturgis, who was one of the founders of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1870. * Newcomb Cushman Barney (1839–1916), who married Elizabeth Jackson Sturgis, sister of Thomas and Frank K. Sturgis. On January 26, 1847, Barney remarried to Azubah Latham (1817–1875), the daughter of William Harris Latham and Azubah (née Jenks) Latham. Azubah was a sister of Charles F. Latham, later treasurer of Wells Fargo & Company, and a first cousin of Milton Latham, a U.S. Senator from California. Barney and his second wife were the parents of three more children: * Arthur Latham Barney (1849–1922), who married Helen Louise Avery, a daughter of John Barber Avery. * Mary Isabelle \\"Belle\\" Barney (1850–1925), who married Walter Smith Gurnee (1846–1918) of New York City. * Lucy Latham Barney (d. 1940), who married John B.

Mallory (ID-1280) was a transport for the United States Navy during World War I. She was also sometimes referred to as USS H. R. Mallory or as USS Mallory. Before her Navy service she was USAT Henry R. Mallory as a United States Army transport ship. From her 1916 launch, and after her World War I military service, she was known as SS Henry R. Mallory for the Mallory Lines. Pressed into service as a troopship in World War II by the War Shipping Administration, she was torpedoed by the in the North Atlantic Ocean and sank with the loss of 272 men—over half of those on board.  World War I  SS Henry R. Mallory was built by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. of Newport News, Virginia (yard no. 193), and delivered to the Mallory Steamship Line on 21 October 1916. Named for Mallory Lines president Henry R. Mallory, she operated on a New Orleans – New York route, carrying passengers and freight.Crowell and Wilson, p. 315–16.  U.S. Army service  After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army, needing transports to get its men and materiel to France, had a select committee of shipping executives pore over registries of American shipping. The committee selected Henry R. Mallory and thirteen other American-flagged ships that were sufficiently fast, could carry enough fuel in their bunkers for transatlantic crossings, and, most importantly, were in port or not far at sea.Sharpe, p. 359.Crowell and Wilson, p. 313–14. After Henry R. Mallory discharged her last load of passengers and cargo, she was officially handed over to the Army on 24 May, one of the first three ships acquired. Before any troop transportation could be undertaken, all of the ships were hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, ten, including Henry R. Mallory, were designated to carry human passengers; the other four were designated as animal ships. The ten ships designated to carry troops had all of their second- and third-class accommodations ripped out and replaced with berths for troops. Cooking and toilet facilities were greatly expanded to handle the large numbers of men aboard. Gun platforms were installed on each ship before docking at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to have the guns themselves installed.Crowell and Wilson, p. 316.The only exception was for , an American Line steamer in transatlantic service to Liverpool. Finland had already been outfitted for guns in early 1917. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.Gleaves, p. 102 The American convoy carrying the first units of the American Expeditionary Forces were broken into four groups;The individual groups of the first convoy were typically counted as separate convoys in post-war sources.

In January 1918, Henry R. Mallory became the first transport to sail from the Newport News embarkation port, when—loaded with eight aero squadrons—she sailed on 17 January.Crowell and Wilson, p. 297.Crowell and Wilson show Henry R. Mallory sailing from Newport News on 24 January 1918 as part of the 18th convoy. See: Crowell and Wilson, p. 605. Departing again from Hoboken on 14 March in the 24th convoy, Henry R. Mallory began her last journey under Army charter. After arriving in France on 26 March and landing her troops, Henry R. Mallory began her return to the United States with Army transport and Navy transport . At 11:45 on 4 April, a German submarine fired torpedoes at the group. Through evasive maneuvers, none of the ships were hit, and with timely gunfire targeting the sub, no more was seen of the threat.Gleaves, p. 168.

This was accomplished soon after so as to avoid the need for what Gleaves called \\"ignorant and unreliable men\\" who were \\"the sweepings of the docks\\".Gleaves, p. 108–10. Accordingly, Henry R. Mallory was handed over to the Navy on 13 April 1918 and commissioned on 17 April. Other than the official change command of the vessel, little else change for Henry R. Mallory. She sailed in her first convoy under Navy command on 23 April, and continued carrying troops to France, making five additional trips before the Armistice in November 1918.First Navy convoy: Crowell and Wilson, p. 608. Number of Navy trips: Gleaves, p. 248. In all, Henry R. Mallory carried 9,756 troops to France.Gleaves, pp. 248–49. With the fighting at an end, the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately.Gleaves, p. 31. Henry R. Mallory did her part by carrying home 14,514 healthy and wounded men in seven roundtrips. Henry R. Mallory returned from her last Navy voyage on 29 August 1919, and was returned to the Mallory Lines the following day.  World War II  In the early stages of World War II for the United States, the War Shipping Administration requisitioned Henry R. Mallory for use as a civilian- manned troopship in July 1942. Remaining under the operation of her owners, Agwilines, Inc., she began operation on U.S. Army schedules in July 1942, when she sailed from New York to Belfast. After her return to New York in August, she made way to Boston from whence she sailed to Saint John, Wabana, Newfoundland; Sydney, Nova Scotia; and Halifax, before returning to New York in October.Charles, p. 193. After first sailing to Boston and Newport, Rhode Island, Henry R. Mallory departed New York as a part of Convoy SC-118 headed for Liverpool via Halifax on 24 January 1943. The crew on board Henry R. Mallory consisted of 9 officers, 68 crewmen, and 34 United States Navy Armed Guard (who manned the 11 guns on deck). Also on board were 383 passengers, consisting of 2 civilians, 136 from the U.S. Army, 72 from the U.S. Marine Corps, and 173 from the U.S. Navy. As the convoy, which consisted of 60 ships and 26 escorts, sailed near Iceland, a \\"wolfpack\\" of Kriegsmarine U-Boats attacked the convoy repeatedly over a four-day period.Helgason, \\"U-Boat Operations\\". Some 20 U-boats participated, ultimately sinking 12 Allied ships, including Henry R. Mallory; three U-boats were lost. It was at 06:59 on 7 February 1943 when, traveling in station 33 of the convoy, Henry R. Mallory was hit by one torpedo launched from around south-southwest of Iceland. Hit in the number three hold on the starboard side, the ship began settling by the stern and listing to port, and sank at about 07:30. Of Henry R. Mallory's ten lifeboats, only three were successfully launched, holding 175 men. Many other men jumped overboard for rafts in the water. None of the other ships in the convoy were aware of the Mallory's predicament. American destroyer —searching for survivors from the convoy's sunken rescue ship, SS Toward, sunk three hours earlier, also by U-402—saw lights but was denied permission to investigate.

He was a linguist familiar with both classical and modern Indian languages, described in his obituary as \\"unrivalled in this country and possibly anywhere in the world today\\". He is the author of two prominent works, The Religious Culture of India: Power, Love and Wisdom and Viraha-Bhakti: The Early History of Kṛṣṇa Devotion in South India. Early years Hardy was born in the Rhineland and according to his obituary \\"showed an early interest in languages and scripts.\\" He began studying Sanskrit in Cologne before moving on to his doctoral work at Oxford University in 1967. While at Oxford, he met Aruna Gokhale, a mathematician, whom he later married. Notable work Hardy went to Tamil Nadu to conduct research for his doctoral thesis, spending over a year examining the history of Krishnaism, specifically all pre-11th century sources starting with the stories of Krishna and the gopis, of Northern Literature, and including Mayon mysticism of the Vaishnava Tamil saints, Sangam Tamil literature and Alvars' Krishna-centered devotion in the rasa of the emotional union and the dating and history of the Bhagavata Purana. The resultant thesis was detailed to the point that it had to be abbreviated for its 1983 publication. His book Viraha-bhakti was considered to have contained some major discoveries. His first discovery concerned the emotion displayed towards Krishna as \\"bhakti\\", or object of devotion, in the Bhagavad Gita. Hardy demonstrated that this was more of an intellectual type, whereas emotional bhakti is different and expressed in the various connections between records and traditions there is evidence of early \\"southern Krishnaism\\", even there was a tendency to allocate this tradition to the Northern traditions. There is a narrative context in which the early writings in Dravidian culture such as Manimekalai and the Cilappatikaram present Krishna, his brother, and favourite female companions in the similar terms. He argued that the Sanskrit Bhagavata Purana is essentially a Sanskrit \\"translation\\" of the bhakti of the Tamil alvars.Norman Cutler (1987) Songs of Experience: The Poetics of Tamil Devotion, p. 13 Accordingly, South Indian texts illustrate close parallels to the Sanskrit traditions of Krishna and his gopi companions, so ubiquitous in later North Indian text and imagery.MONIUS, Anne E.: Dance Before Doom. Krishna in the Non-Hindu Literature of Early Medieval South India. In: Beck, Guy L., ed. Alternative Krishnas. Regional and Vernacular Variations on a Hindu Deity. Albany: State University of New York Press 2005; Ch. 8. pp. 139–149. Some consider his work fundamental to the study of how Hinduism developed. He had also theorised in his subsequent publications how Tamil bhakti gradually spread to the North India and laid the ground for the later bhakti of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Vallabhacharya. Notable theories and statements thumb ;*;Erotic images on Hindu Temples After long studies in India, Fred Hardy came up with a theory as to the meaning of erotic sculptures, such as for example visible on the temples of Khajuraho. The erotic sculptures are visible on may temple of the South India, the main area of expertise of Hardy. This theory was first expressed to him by people in a temple's environs. Fred Hardy theorised that the erotic sculptures on the outer walls of Hindu temples are intended to keep away demons from the pure sanctuary of the shrines. ;*;Modern Myth of Hinduism He has suggested: That the global title of \\"Hinduism\\" has been given to [such a variety of religions] must be regarded as an act of pure despair.Richard King Orientalism and Religion (1999) ;*;Pluralism in religion He had concluded: religious pluralism is demonstrable nonsense. Other works and projects His also was an editor of a general companion to Indic religions, The World's Religions: the Religions of Asia published in 1990. He was also notably invited to give the Wilde Lectures on Comparative Religion at Oxford University were later published in 1994 as The Religious Culture of India: Power, Love and Wisdom.

Geonets are often laminated with geotextiles on one or both surfaces and are then referred to as drainage geocomposites. They are competitive with other drainage geocomposites having different core configurations.  Manufacturing  Geonets are formed by a continuous extrusion process into a netlike configuration of parallel sets of homogeneously interconnected ribs. There are three categories of geonets. The following are illustrated: * Biplanar geonets: These are the original and most common types and consist of two sets of intersecting ribs at different angles and spacings. The ribs themselves are of different sizes and shapes for different styles. * Triplanar geonets: These have parallel central ribs with smaller sets of ribs above and beneath mainly for geometric stability. * Other geonets: These newer geonet structures have either box shaped channels or protruding columns from an underlying support network. Each of the above categories have variations within themselves (mainly thickness) and new product development by various manufacturers is quite active. All geonets that are currently available are made from polyethylene resin. The density varies from 0.94 to 0.96 mg/l, with the higher values forming the more rigid products. In this regard, the resin is true high-density polyethylene (HDPE) unlike the density used in HDPE geomembranes that is really medium density. The resin is formulated with 2.0 to 2.5% carbon black (usually in a concentrated form mixed with a polyethylene carrier resin), and 0.25 to 0.75% additives that serve as processing aids and anti- oxidants. While quite different in the manufacture or configuration than geonets are competitive geosynthetic products called \\"geospacers\\". Their drainage cores consists of nubs, columns, cuspations, or 3-D networks of stiff polymer strands. They are generally used for drainage behind retaining walls, plaza decks or green roofs. Various categories of geonets.  Properties  Since the primary function of a geonet is to convey liquid within the plane of its structure, the in-plane hydraulic flow rate, or transmissivity, is of paramount importance. However, other features, which may influence this value over the service lifetime of the geonet, are also of importance. Thus, a number of physical, mechanical, endurance, and environmental properties will also be mentioned.  Physical properties  The tests for physical properties are either covered in ASTM, ISO or GRI Standards. * density or specific gravity * mass per unit area (weight) * rib dimensions * planar angles * junction characteristics * aperture size and shape  Mechanical properties  * tensile strength and elongation * compression strength and deformation * shear strength  Hydraulic properties  * planar transmisivity  Endurance properties  * type of resin * creep behavior * intrusion of adjacent materials * extrusion of clay materials  Environmental properties  A series of environmental related issues can have impact on the flow-rate performance of geonets. * temperature effects * permeating liquid properties * biological growth within geonet structure * resistance to light and weather  Theoretical concepts  Design-by-function requires the formulation of a factor of safety as follows: FS=\\\\frac{\\\\text{allowable (test) value}}{\\\\text{required (design) value}} For geonets serving as a drainage medium, the targeted value is flow rate and the above concept becomes: FS=\\\\frac{q_{allow}}{q_{reqd}} where aallow = allowable flow rate, and qreqd = required flow rate As stated previously, if we desire an alternative to the flow rate, calculations can be based on Darcy's formula (assuming saturated conditions and laminar flow) obtaining the transmissivity, θ. This important concept is repeated. q=kiA q=ki(W\\\\times t) q=(kt)iW kt= \\\\mathit{\\\\Theta} = \\\\frac{q}{iW} where q = volumetric flow rate (m3/s), k = coefficient of permeability (m/s), i = hydraulic gradient (dimensionless), A = flow cross-section area (m2), θ = transmissivity (m2/s), W = width (m), and t = thickness (m). As seen in the equation, q/W and θ carry the same units and are directly related to one another by means of the hydraulic gradient i. At a hydraulic gradient of 1.0, they are numerically identical. At all other values of hydraulic gradient they are not equal. Also note that the system should be saturated and flow must be laminar in order to use transmissivity. When in doubt, it is usually best to use flow rate per unit width.  Construction methods  Geonets are supplied in rolls from 2.0 to 6.7 m wide. They should be placed and covered in a timely manner. While UV and heat effects are not as severe in geonets as they are in geotextile (because of thicker ribs in contrast to thin yarns and fibers), it is good practice not to leave the material exposed and subjected to accidental damage or contamination of any variety. Contamination can occur from soil, miscellaneous sediment, construction debris, ingrowing vegetation, and so on. The rolls are usually placed with their roll directions oriented up-and-down slope, rather than along (or parallel to) them. There are two reasons for this: First, the machine direction has the greatest strength and flow rate; second, such orientation eliminates seams along the flow direction. If triplanar or boxlike channel geonets are being used for their high flow in the machine direction, the proper orientation is critical during placement. For very long slopes or along the base of a facility, flow must continue unimpeded from one geonet to the next. When geotextiles are liminated to the geonet, the geotextiles must be stripped back from the overlapped area such the upgradient geonet is directly on the downgradient geonet in shingled manner. There can be no geotextile sandwiched within this overlap area. The seaming or joining of geonets is difficult. Assuming stress does not have to be transferred from one roll to the next, plastic electrical ties, threaded loops, and wires have all been used with a relatively small overlaps of 50 100 mm. Metal hog rings should never be used when geonets are used adjacent to geomembranes. There are questions as to what influence overlapping has on the geonet's flow rate. The connection of geonets to perforated drainage pipes is difficult and extremely important. The geonet's outlet must be free draining at all times even in winter under freezing conditions. Notwithstanding the above concerns, geonets are very impressive with respect to their flow-rate capability, ease of construction, savings in airspace, and overall economy in many facilities where drainage must be accommodated.

This former estate location is now Crown Land nearby Searchlight Gate). Woodend is in the Parish of Ascot and Sunninghill and today 2020, there are a few cottages called Woodend Cottages along the Windsor Rd towards Ascot. 2) Woodside (to the northern end up to the Mounts Hill roundabout better known as The Peanut Roundabout due to its shape).

A second edition was published in 1871 which included previously unpublished Jane Austen writings. A family project, the biography was written by James Edward Austen-Leigh but owed much to the recollections of Jane Austen's many relatives. However, it was the decisions of her sister, Cassandra Austen, to destroy many of Jane's letters after her death that shaped the material available for the biography. Austen- Leigh described his \\"dear Aunt Jane\\" domestically, as someone who was uninterested in fame and who only wrote in her spare time. However, the manuscripts appended to the second edition suggest that Jane Austen was intensely interested in revising her manuscripts and was perhaps less content than Austen-Leigh described her. The Memoir does not attempt to unreservedly tell the story of Jane Austen's life. Following the Victorian conventions of biography, it kept much private information from the public, but family members disagreed over just how much should be revealed, for example, regarding Austen's romantic relationships. The Memoir introduced the public to the works of Jane Austen, generating interest in novels which only the literary elite had read up until that point. It remained the primary biographical work on the author for over half a century.The British Library (2019). A Memoir of Jane Austen. [online] The British Library. Available at: https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/a-memoir-of-jane-austen [Accessed 30 Jan. 2019]. Composition James Edward Austen-Leigh (1860s) In the late 1860s, the Austen family decided to write a biography of Jane Austen. The death of Sir Francis Austen, her last surviving sibling, and the ageing of those who had any memory of her prompted the family to gather their papers and to begin recording their memories.\\"Introduction\\", xx–xxi. Public interest in Jane Austen was also developing and the family became concerned that an outsider or another branch of the family would produce a biography. James Edward Austen- Leigh, as the son of the eldest branch, \\"in a spirit of censorship as well as communication\\", thus began the project.\\"Introduction\\", xxi. With the help and support of his sisters and Jane Austen's nieces, he collected materials. The biography was largely the work of James Edward Austen-Leigh, his half-sister Jane Anna Elizabeth Austen Lefroy and, his younger sister Caroline Mary Craven Austen, and their cousin Cassy Esten.\\"Introduction\\", xxxi. As Austen scholar Kathryn Sutherland points out in her \\"Introduction\\" to the Oxford edition of the Memoir, however, Austen-Leigh's biography is specific to the Steventon or Hampshire Austens, for whom Jane Austen is \\"nature-loving, religious, domestic, [and] middle class\\". The Godmersham or Kentish Austens viewed Jane Austen as more \\"inward and passionate...gentrified, improved willy-nilly by contact with her fine relations\\".\\"Introduction\\", xxv. Moreover, as Caroline wrote, \\"the generation who knew her is passing away\\".\\"Introduction\\", xvi. Much of the biography is based on the memories of those who had only known Jane Austen when they were children and she was their older aunt; the rest is based on written records passed down through the family.\\"Introduction\\", xxi-xxiii. As Sutherland explains, \\"the major ingredients of the Memoir, as well as its reverent colouring, are owed, in one way or another, to Cassandra Austen.\\"\\"Introduction\\", xxviii. Cassandra was the executor of Jane's will and was responsible for the preservation and destruction of all remaining letters and manuscripts after Jane's death. According to Caroline Austen, one of Jane Austen's nieces, Cassandra \\"looked [the letters] over and burnt the greater part, (as she told me), 2 or 3 years before her own death—She left, or gave some as legacies to the Nieces—but of those that I have seen, several had portions cut out\\".Qtd. in \\"Introduction\\", xxix. Thus, while writing the Memoir, Austen-Leigh did not have access to large numbers of Jane Austen's letters. Furthermore, the rest had been scattered as bequests; a complete collection of Jane Austen's extant letters was only gathered in 1932.\\"Introduction\\", xxviii-xxix. There may have been disagreements between the descendants regarding how much information to keep private, particularly with regards to Jane Austen's romances. For example, the first edition of the Memoir states \\"I have no reason to think that she ever felt any attachment by which the happiness of her life was at all affected\\". This sentence was removed from the second edition and two romantic attachments are hinted at, with the conclusion \\"I am unable to say whether her feelings were of such a nature as to affect her happiness\\".Qtd. in \\"Introduction\\", xxxiv. This kind of reticence was not isolated to the Austen family, however—it was typical of mid-Victorian era biography.\\"Introduction\\", xxxv. Publication Original watercolor sketch by Cassandra Austen (c. 1810) James Andrews. This watercolour served as the source for later engravings. James Edward Austen- Leigh began writing the Memoir on 30 March 1869 and finished it five months later in September. It was published on 16 December 1869 (though dated 1870) in an edition of about 1,000 copies.\\"Introduction\\", xliv. In 1871, Austen- Leigh published a second edition, which contained additional letters, family papers, and biographical material. He also included fragments of unfinished and unpublished Jane Austen manuscripts, namely a chapter Austen deleted from Persuasion and extracts from Sanditon as well as Lady Susan and The Watsons.\\"Introduction\\", xlix. Used as a frontispiece for the Memoir was a portrait of Jane Austen drawn by James Andrews of Maidenhead. Based on a \\"slight watercolour sketch\\" made by Cassandra around 1810, Andrews produced a professional portrait that served as a model for a steel engraving. As Sutherland notes, \\"its difference from Cassandra's original is evident to the most cursory glance. Her crude pencil and watercolour likeness is sharp-faced, pursed-lipped, unsmiling, scornful even, and withdrawn; in its Victorian refashioning, the face is softer, its expression more pliant, and the eyes only pensively averted.\\"\\"Introduction\\", xlv. Andrews paid great attention to the details of Austen's dress and the chair. Cassy Esten, who owned the original sketch, wrote of the portrait: \\"I think the portrait is very much superior to any thing that could have been expected from the sketch it was taken from.—It is a very pleasing, sweet face,—tho’, I confess, to not thinking it much like the original;—but that, the public will not be able to detect.\\"Qtd. in “Introduction’, xlvi. * Austen Leigh, James Edward, A Memoir of Jane Austen, Reissued by Cambridge University Press 2009, Description Title page from the second edition of the Memoir (1871) The Memoir is a \\"rag- bag, not the shaped life of the historio- or psycho-biographies of the late twentieth century, but an undesigned and unprioritized assortment\\" of detail, such as descriptions of clothing, a \\"eulogy of spinning\\", and a digression on the Welsh ancestry of some Austen relations.\\"Introduction\\", xxxii. Nor does the biography aim to tell the unvarnished truth. For example, the family hid the existence of a second brother, the handicapped George Austen, and described Edward Austen as the second brother instead of the third. They also omitted the arrest and jailing of Mrs. Leigh Perrot, Jane Austen's aunt, for shoplifting in Bath. According to 19th-century biography standards, \\"neither piece of discretion is surprising\\".\\"Introduction\\", xxxiii. Jane Austen herself is described as \\"a comfortable figure, shunning fame and professional status, centred in home, writing only in the intervals permitted from the important domestic duties of a devoted daughter, sister, and aunt\\".\\"Introduction\\", xv. However, the manuscripts published alongside the biography suggest another portrait, one of a struggling author who endlessly revised and of a \\"restless and sardonic spirit\\". Reception and legacy The book had an \\"immediate\\" and \\"incalculable\\" effect on the public's perception of Jane Austen. It generated interest in the works of an author which, for half a century, had been read almost entirely by the literary elite, and Austen's popularity increased dramatically.Southam, \\"Introduction\\", Vol. 2, 1–2. The publication of the Memoir also spurred the reissue of Austen's novels. The first popular editions were released in 1883—a sixpenny series by Routledge. This was followed by fancy illustrated editions, collectors' sets, and scholarly editions.Southam, \\"Introduction\\", Vol. 2, 58–62. The image of \\"dear aunt Jane\\" presented in the biography was not seriously challenged until 1940, when psychologist D. W. Harding argued that there was a \\"regulated hatred\\" in Austen's works. With the exception of Harding's 1965 edition, there has been \\"no serious editorial engagement with the Memoir and little critical attention paid to it. However, as Sutherland writes, \\"James Austen-Leigh...assembled a major work of Austenian biography\\" which has been called the \\"prime source of all subsequent biographical writings\\".David Gilson qtd. in \\"Introduction\\", xv.

Overview It shows the splendour of Ranjit Singh's court and is decorated with richly worked sheets of gold. The distinctive cusped base of this throne is composed of two tiers of lotus petals. The lotus is a symbol of purity and creation and a Lotus throne has traditionally been used as a seat or throne for Hindu gods. It is thought that as the Maharaja was renowned for the simplicity of his appearance and dislike of ceremony he rarely sat on this throne, preferring to sit cross-legged on carpets. The throne was part of the State Property taken by the British in 1849 on the annexation of Punjab, after the Second Anglo-Sikh War. It was taken to London and displayed with other treasures of the British Empire at the Great Exhibition in 1851. It then went on display in the India Museum, also in London. Indian student Rakhal das Haldar visited it there and recorded that \\"it was painful to see the state chair of gold of the late Lion of Punjab [Ranjit Shah] with a mere picture upon it\\". The throne later passed to the Victoria & Albert Museum, where it is currently housed under inventory number 2518(IS).

As of 1889 she became bedridden. In February 1899, her spiritual director asked her to begin a diary of her spiritual experiences, which she continued until 1938. Her writing ran to thirty-six volumes. In 1926, Annibale Maria di Francia was in Trani to open branches of his newly established institutes; he asked her to write her autobiography.

Visual3D was founded by PowerAccess for Microsoft Access founder, Dan Moorehead, after its free and open-source software predecessor, RealmForge Game Engine, was featured as the cover story and namesake for Software Developer's Journal July 2015 issue titled 3D Games in .NET, for first proving that C#, .NET Framework, and managed languages were feasible for mainstream 3D game and simulation development. Visual3D (formerly known as Visual3D.NET) is built on the Microsoft XNA, as the first major XNA- based engine and game development tool. However, Visual3D predates XNA and XNA's successor, MonoGame, with it first being built upon managed wrappers for Direct3D and OpenGL. Visual3D is also notable for providing its game development tools as integrated or hosted within whatever game is being developed with it, for live, real-time world building, terrain editing, game development, scripting and mission/level/scenario editing, as well as allowing end-users to redistribute its development tools to End-Users as a Mission/Level/Scenario Editor and Modding Toolkit. History Visual3D Game Engine is the commercial successor to the open-source RealmForge Game Engine with roots going back to the OGRE 3D open-source engine. Visual3D is the flagship product of PowerAccess predecessor Realmware Corporation, based in Seattle, Washington. Visual3D was founded by Dan Moorehead, who, in addition to founding PowerAccess and RealmForge, had also lead development of the Axiom Engine (a C# port of OGRE) and CEGUI# (a C# port of CEGUI GUI library). Visual3D has 30,000 registered users, and, as of July 2008, Visual3D Game Engine has been employed for multiple private business projects and by the US Department of Defense for military simulation and training. Also in 2008, Visual3D Game Engine has begun to permeate education and Indie sectors as a part of the recent XNA trends. Visual3D license editions included Indie, Professional, Enterprise, Enterprise Source, as well as Free editions for Open-Source and Educational use. Migration of game development to managed languages with C#, Microsoft XNA and MonoGame Following Visual3D predecessor RealmForge Game Engine's success as the first 3D game engine and integrated development toolset for C# and .NET, and it features as the cover story for Software Developer's Journal July 2015 3D Games in .NET issue, Microsoft announced the first public release of its Microsoft XNA Framework and XNA Game Studio products in the August 2006 keynote speech at Microsoft Gamefest conference, confirming the viability of C# and .NET for game development and opening up Xbox 360 and PC for game development by Indies and students with C# and .NET. This announcement set into motion the rise of many new XNA-based game engines, such as Torque X, a rewrite of GarageGames's popular Torque Game Engine in C# using the XNA Framework. Microsoft's XNA initiative is a part of the larger trend for gaming technology migrating from traditional C++ to higher level managed languages, such as Java, C#, and VB.NET, which is a continuation of the historic trends for the migration of software development from lower level languages such as Assembly and C to higher level languages such as C++.

He wrote an influential analysis of voting systems in his doctoral thesis, later published as Theory of Voting. Farquharson diagnosed himself as suffering from bipolar disorder (manic depression), and episodes of mania made it difficult for him to obtain a permanent university position and also resulted in him losing commercial employment. In later years, he dropped out of mainstream society, and became a prominent counter-cultural figure in late-1960s London. Farquharson wrote an account of his unconventional life in his 1968 book, Drop Out!, in which he described a week of being homeless in London. In 1973 he died from burns associated with an arson, for which two persons were convicted of unlawful killing. Education Robin Farquharson was educated at Michaelhouse, Natal, South Africa, 1944–46. He earned a B.A. in South Africa from Rhodes University College, Grahamstown (1947–50). Subsequently studying at Brasenose and Nuffield Colleges, University of Oxford (1950–53), he obtained a second-class B.A. honours PPE degree. For his B.A. 1953–54 (?), his studies at this time were overseen by David Butler of Nuffield College, Oxford University. His D.Phil. was awarded in June 1958 from Nuffield College for his thesis entitled \\"An Approach to a Pure Theory of Voting Procedures\\". He was given a Research Fellowship at Churchill College, Cambridge in 1964. He also studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. While an undergraduate at Oxford, Farquharson was a contemporary of John Searle, Rupert Murdoch,Neil Chenoweth, Rupert Murdoch: The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Media Wizard, Diane Pub. Co., 2004, . and Sir Michael Dummett. Research on voting Farquharson wrote a monograph on the analysis of voting procedures and several papers, including a notable paper with Michael Dummett that conjectured the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem. Strategic voting Farquharson published influential articles on the theory of voting: in particular, in an article with Michael Dummett, he conjectured that deterministic voting rules with more than three issues faced endemic strategic voting. The Dummett–Farquharson conjecture was proved by Allan Gibbard, a philosopher and former student of Kenneth J. Arrow and John Rawls, and by Mark A. Satterthwaite, an economist. After the establishment of the Farquarson-Dummett conjecture by Gibbard and Sattherthwaite, Michael Dummett contributed three proofs of the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem in his monograph on voting.Michael Dummett, Voting Procedures (Oxford, 1984). Theory of Voting In the field of political game theory, Farquharson's main contribution was his exposition of the Condorcet paradox regarding the sincerity of voters. The problem was initially raised by Pliny the Younger and then picked up again in the political pamphlets of Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), who was a significant influence on Farquharson. Theory of Voting was originally Farquharson's doctoral thesis but was deemed to be of such a high quality it was later published as a book in its own right. Although written in 1958, when his doctorate was awarded, it was eventually published in 1969, by Yale University Press. The main reason given for the delay in publication is that Farquharson insisted that the logical choice diagrams be printed in colour, which they eventually were, in black, white and red. The book won the Monograph Prize in the field of Social Sciences, awarded by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Mental illness At some point, Farquharson came to diagnose himself as suffering from several mental illnesses including bipolar disorder (manic depression) and cyclothymia. His condition caused him to be absent frequently from his university studies, starting November 1955 to March 1957. He was further absent from his studies after the death of his father. Call to the Warden of All Souls College As Michael Dummett recalls, in 1955 Farquharson sat the Fellowship examination for All Souls College. On the evening before an election meeting was held to discuss Farquharson's admission as a Fellow, the Warden of the college received a telephone call, which started with the words: \\"Do you have a pen and paper?\\" Farquharson tried to dictate what Dummett describes (he was not present himself) as a \\"lengthy statement in quasi-technical language, expounding a discovery in which would have solve [sic] many problems in mathematics, mathematical logic, physics, economics and the theory of voting.\\" Dummett's clarifies the accuracy of his recollection: \\"I know very well what it was like: though I was away for the year in California, Farquharson also telephoned me there in just the same manner.\\" Farquharson was undergoing an attack of his mental illness, which it is believed caused him to contact the College Warden. Dummett believes that Farquharson was far and above the best candidate for the election to the college; however, the Warden chose to mention Farquharson's telephone call to the Fellows, and Dummett believes the Warden \\"...inferred that Farquharson had gone mad\\", which no doubt led to his not being elected to the senior position of Fellow at All Souls College. Farquharson briefly describes the incident in Drop Out!: \\"...when as a candidate for a Fellowship of All Souls, I had destroyed my chances by a telephone call to the Warden, calling him from his high table to tell him that I had a message from God for him.\\" Farquharson, Drop Out!, 1968, p. 38. Mental health activism After fully dropping out Farquharson did some work supporting the mental health patient reform groups of the late 1960s, working with organisations such as the Mental Patients' Union.Survivors History Group. He wrote, campaigned and argued with other members of the group for mental patients to have a greater say in their own treatment. He also helped to secure squatted sites and rent houses for groups to hold meetings and simply for a place to live. Farquharson was a mental health activist working both with Tommie Ritchie in the Scottish Union of Mental Patients (SUMP) during 1972 and then the Mental Patients Union in 1973, shortly before his death. He was the first member of SUMP from outside Hartwood Hospital. . Later life and work After being rejected from a prospective Fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, Farquharson worked for a brief time as an academic at Cambridge University. After losing this job he worked in various other administrative positions, including as a manager for a call centre. He also contributed to the counter-cultural Bitman magazine, which published a special obituary edition as a tribute to him after his death in 1973. His friend Guy Legge, who knew him from his time in Horton Hospital, thought Robin was an alcoholic and blames his wild mood swings on his dependency. Autobiographical Drop Out! Dropping out commonly refers to a person who has left an educational institution without completing the course. This does not apply in the same way to Robin Farquharson, who held several degrees. The title of his book more accurately refers to his dropping out from the comfort of academic life into the uncertainty of London street-life. The book begins with a quote from a poem by Matthew Arnold:Selected Poems of Matthew Arnold, Macmillan, 1890. > We cannot kindle when we will > The fire which in the heart resides, > The spirit bloweth and is still, > In mystery our soul abides: > But tasks in hours of insight willed > Can be through hours of gloom fulfilled. – Matthew Arnold, \\"Morality\\". Essentially the book is an account of Farquharson finding himself homeless and with little money and many debts to claim, both through circumstance and his own actions. In an experimental spirit he attempts to forsake money (several times and with varying success) as a kind of restrictive social evil. This leaves him with very little option but to sleep rough and stay with friends or acquaintances now and again. The book includes a chapter on the free help offered by Rhaune Laslett and the Notting Hill Neighbourhood Service. Many people see the book as a slightly forced and therefore somewhat un-genuine attempt to slum it with the lower classes in that Robin is so often bailed out by either good fortune, the kindness of strangers or old friends. It is much easier to step into a life of destitution like a puddle and to briskly leave it if the water becomes too cold knowing that there is money behind you and lots of people who are prepared to help you, for a short while at least. The book is similar in style and content to other works of psycho-geography written by the situationists. Many sections of the book simply list the areas of London Farquharson has walked through, including the names of streets and buildings he passes, interspersed with events and acquaintances he makes along the way. It is the flux of his mental state and the variety of situations he encounters that make the book an interesting and vibrant account of London in the late-1960s. He copies information on a notice board, and rates graffiti in a public toilet for spelling, grammar and general interest. Quotations Below are some quotes featured in Drop Out! (Farquharson attributes many of these quotes to John Anthony Berridge,Farquharson, Drop Out, 1968, p. 14. a Brasenose contemporary.) \\"After LSD, one is likely to be much less attracted by money and luxuries and material success.\\" \\"A rolling stone gathers speed.\\" \\"A stitch in time distorts eternity.\\" Political activity In 1965 Farqharson's South African passport was revoked as a result of his part in the lobbying, on behalf of SAN-ROC, for South Africa's exclusion from the Olympic Games held in Tokyo, Japan, in 1964. He was rumoured to have been a member of the political White Panther movement. He became a British subject in 1968. He is also said to have helped tear down the walls at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970.http://members.fortunecity.com/timetortoise/iow-70-r-farquharson.html The squat years Towards the end of his life Farquharson spent much of his time in \\"open-university\\" squat communities, a period during which he met artists and thinkers, including the poet Aidan Andrew Dun and the psychiatrist R. D. Laing. Death Farquharson died as the result of a fire at a house in Platt Street, Somers Town, London, in April 1973, down the road from St Pancras Old Church. After being exposed to the fire, Farquharson suffered third-degree burns. He was taken to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases near to St Pancras churchyard, where he died from his burns. Two workers also living in the house were tried for his death and found guilty of \\"unlawful killing\\".

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also recognised Halong as the fifth tropical depression, the fourth tropical storm as well as the third typhoon of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season. Meteorological history Late on May 13 a tropical disturbance formed in the South China Sea. Early the next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the disturbance as a tropical depression, with PAGASA assigning the local name of Cosme. However the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) did not issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert until later that day. The JTWC then designated the depression as 05W on May 15. On May 16 both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm with the JMA designating it as Tropical Storm Halong and assigning the international number of 0804. This was 12 hours after PAGASA had upgraded it to a tropical storm. During that day Halong kept intensifying and was designated as a severe tropical storm early the next day by the JMA as it reached its peak wind speeds of 60 knots (70 mph 115 km/h). The JTWC then upgraded Halong to a typhoon with peak wind speeds of 70 knots (80 mph 130 km/h)) which made Halong a Category one typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Later on May 17, Halong made landfall on the Philippine region of Pangasinan and travelled towards the northeast over Luzon. While over land Halong weakened into a tropical storm with both the JTWC and the JMA downgrading Halong early the next day. Later that day after reaching the Philippine Sea, Halong started to restrengthen and intensified into a severe tropical storm. However it did not intensify any further and on May 19 weakened into a tropical storm. Later that day, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Halong as it moved out of their area of responsibility. The JTWC then issued their last advisory on Halong as it had begun its extratropical transition. The JMA then reported that it had completed its extratropical transition and issued their final advisory on the remnant low of Halong. The remnants of Halong dissipated on May 24. Preparations Starting May 15, PAGASA issued Storm Warning Signals for various areas across the Philippines. At 1500 UTC that day Signal Number One was initially issued over northern Palawan, Occidental Mindoro and Lubang Island.WebCite query result At its maximum coverage (at 0930 UTC May 17), Storm Signal Number 3 was issued for Zambales, Pangasinan, La Union, Tarlac, Benguet and Ilocos Sur, Signal Number 2 was for Bataan, Bulacan, Pampanga, Nueva Vizcaya, Nueva Ecija, Quirino, Ifugao, Mt. Province, Kalinga, Abra, Apayao and Ilocos Norte and Signal Number 1 was raised for Lubang Island, Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, northern Quezon, Isabela, Aurora, Cagayan, Calayan Island, Babuyan Group of Islands, Batanes and Metro ManilaWebCite query result Further on as Cosme (Halong) razed through Northern Luzon, these storm signals were scaled back until the storm reached the Cagayan-Batanes area and the Pacific Ocean proper.WebCite query result Impact=Philippines In Luzon, the typhoon caused 58 deaths and $94 million (USD) in damage. The storm destroyed 43,365 houses and damaged 188,830 more. Most of the damages reported were in Northern Luzon. Meanwhile, Mindoro and Panay islands were also affected as the storm-induced southwest monsoon brought rains and floods to those areas. In particular, a ferry in Mindoro was stranded as Cosme (still a tropical depression at that time) passed close enough to Mindoro on the night of May 15.(Update) 'Cosme' batters parts of RP; 300 stranded ferry passengers safe 05/16/2008  08:45 PM The Subic-Olongapo area, one of the economic zones of the Philippines, experienced power outages as the storm got closer to Zambales on May 17. The province of Pangasinan, where the storm made its landfall, experienced waist- high floods and power outages as well. Even the city of Dagupan (in Pangasinan) suffered the same fate with even stranded persons all over the city due to flooding.(Update) ‘Cosme’ reaches Benguet; 14 areas under storm signal 3 05/17/2008  11:23 PM The town of Sta. Cruz in Zambales had about 7,000 people homeless due to Cosme. Overall, the hardest hit were Pangasinan and Zambales provinces. Because the damage caused by the storm in Zambales is extensive even in infrastructure, repair was forced to be done on schools there as that time, classes are to resume in the next few weeks. The storm also increased the prices of vegetables in Metro Manila, as the latter gets most of its vegetables from Northern Luzon. Many places were flooded like what happened from Typhoon Ketsana. According to the final report on Cosme (Halong) released by the National Disaster Coordinating Council, 61 were reported killed, 33 wounded and three were left missing. People affected by Cosme numbered 1,496,635 persons in 1,510 barangays in five provinces. Damages to property totaled to PHP 4.712 billion, of PHP 3.721 billion were agricultural losses and PHP 992 million were destroyed infrastructure.Final Report on the Aftermath of Tropical Storm “COSME” (Halong) and the Rehabilitation Efforts in Pangasinan GLENN J RABONZA, July 21, 2008, National Disaster Management Center, Camp Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, Quezon City, Philippines Pangasinan was the most damaged province as indicated by the report. Japan The extratropical remnants of Halong brought heavy rains to parts of Japan, injuring one person. Naming The name \\"Halong\\" was one of the 10 original names submitted by Vietnam to the WMO's Typhoon Committee for use from January 1, 2000. Halong was last used in the 2002 Pacific typhoon season and is named after Halong Bay, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site in Vietnam. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigned the name Cosme to the tropical storm. Cosme was last used in the 2004 Pacific typhoon season to name Typhoon Sudal. This was the seventh time that a tropical cyclone had been named Cosme. After Cosme/Halong caused a high amount of damage to the Philippines, the name Cosme was removed from PAGASA's naming lists. In June 2012 the name selected by PAGASA to replace Cosme was Carina, and was first used in the 2012 season.

It was built by the Works Progress Administration in 1935, and is located in Bluefield's city park that straddles the West Virginia–Virginia state line. The facility now serves as the home football field for the public high schools of Bluefield and its twin city of the same name in Virginia—Bluefield High School in West Virginia and Graham High School in Virginia. The stadium is in West Virginia, unlike the neighboring Bowen Field baseball park, which is in Virginia. This means that Graham High School High School is unique among American high schools in that its home football games are actually played in another state. The stadium is actually, however, closer to the Graham High School building than the Bluefield High School building. History City Manager Emory P. Mitchell would work to develop a recreation commission in Bluefield and set out to secure funds to build a city park, pool, auditorium, football field, baseball field and tennis courts. \\"Of all the projects completed during the years Mitchell served as manager of (Bluefield), none was closer to his heart than the stadium,\\" Betty Mitchell Nelson, retired dean of students of Purdue University quoted from the dedication of the stadium on Oct. 23, 1954, in a letter she sent to the Bluefield board of directors. A school classmate had provided her with articles concerning a proposal to change the name of Mitchell Stadium, and Nelson, who retired as dean of students at Purdue after 30 years of service, shared insights as to why the city leadership chose to name the stadium for him. The dedication took place on Oct. 23, 1954, more than three years after Mitchell's death on May 25, 1951. \\"The stadium is named for the late Emory P. Mitchell as a permanent and lasting memorial to a devoted public servant who, in his lifetime, sought no praise or commendation for his efforts except the realization that his community had benefited from his work,\\" according to the formal remarks presented at the dedication. Like her parents, Nelson dedicated her life to serving her community, West Lafayette, Ind. About 15 years ago, the Purdue University Chapter of Mortar Board created the Dean Betty Nelson Service Awards that are given annually to a student and a student organization for their excellence in community service in the Lafayette area. Nelson participated annually in the presentation which involves a certificate and a monetary award. Nelson said that her parents showed the way for her in terms of community service. Her mother helped with meals at the YWCA and knit socks and sewed surgical gowns for the American Red Cross. \\"My father counted the offering after church every Sunday for years and took me with him to deliver Whitman's Samplers and bags of fruit to families of city workers who obviously had few luxuries,\\" she said in response to an e-mail question concerning her father's commitment to community service. Returning to the narrative from the stadium dedication: \\"There was one occasion during the time when government agencies were allocating moneys to municipalities for such projects, with the provision that the municipalities themselves also match the funds, that Bluefield was about to lose a large federal grant because the city had no matching fund,\\" Nelson wrote. \\"Mitchell and members of his family signed a personal note that enabled the city to borrow the necessary funds to match the federal grant so that work could continue on the stadium.\\" Mitchell didn't start off in the city's top job. When he was 22 years old, the 1907 Bluefield City Directory listed E.P. Mitchell as serving as a bookkeeper for E.S. Pedigo. At the time, Pedigo operated a dry goods, clothing and millinery store on Princeton Avenue. Mitchell lived in a room at 806 Highland Avenue, according to information in the city directory. In her letter to the city board of directors, Mitchell's daughter said her father held administrative positions at other Bluefield businesses before he accepted the appointment as city treasurer on Aug. 1, 1933. Mitchell's appointment as controller of the city's purse strings came at a critical time in Bluefield's history. Bluefield, like many U.S. cities, experienced the surging economy of the so- called \\"Roaring '20s,\\" and suffered the horrible economic realities that followed the Stock Market Crash in 1929, and led to the nation's prolonged economic slide commonly called \\"The Great Depression.\\" In Bluefield, it took a while for the new economic reality to sink in, and Mitchell's appointment as treasurer in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal package was in its infancy. Although it wasn't a popular thing to do at the time, Mitchell told the city that its budget would be more that $25,000 in the red that year unless it took drastic measures. The city shaved some expenses by shutting off every other street light and by cutting its support for the public library — handing the reigns of the library over to the Bluefield Woman's Club. The city's elected city officials took heat for new austerity measures, but the community continued growing and needed to address ways to deal with an increasing population base. In 1935, the city took the steps necessary to address the problem related to sewage treatment and on Oct. 22, 1935, the city used federal funds available for construction of municipal sewage treatment facilities and created the Sanitary Board of Bluefield with treatment plants in the city's East end and in Bluefield, Va. The unique two-state sewage treatment system has had its share of challenges through the years, but continues to serve residents of both Bluefields. In the election of July 6, 1937, citizens voted for change. Popular Bluefield newsman William C. Snyder, of the Bluefield Daily Telegraph, led the ticket of a new city board. As soon as the board could reorganize, Snyder became mayor, and the board appointed Mitchell to serve as city manager. On Sept. 6, 1937, Mitchell was formally sworn in to serve as city manager. He didn't make any friends when he recommended the installation of a novelty of the time — parking meters — to address the city's traffic challenges, and he made even fewer friends when he recommended the creation of a Parks & Recreation Commission. In 1939, the commission recommended that the city pass an excess levy to fund improvements at the city park that would include the development of separate parks inside the city, each with their own swimming pools, to serve both the white and black citizens of Bluefield. Voters did not pass the excess levy in a special election on July 25, 1939, ultimately prompting Mitchell to personally insure the local match for the estimated $174,000 cost of the 10,000-seat stadium. The late H. Edward \\"Eddie\\" Steele said that the city had an inside contact with the federal Works Progress Administration who was able to steer WPA crews in the direction of Bluefield to build important municipal projects. Steele did not say who the connection was, but during Mitchell's 14 years as Bluefield city manager, the city was successful in completing a number of projects, including, but not limited to, the stadium that bears his name. During Mitchell's tenure, the city installed a police radio system; built Bowen Field and erected a grandstand; managed to bring WPA crews to the city to erect the stone retaining walls along Princeton Avenue in the East end of the city; acquired the land and built the East River Playground for $5,000, and acquired the land and built a playground on the city's North side for $17,000; and built the Scott Street Municipal Parking Garage at a cost of $500,000. Nelson added that her father felt it was important for the city to remember its history, and led efforts to acquire and remove the old Davidson cabin to make way for the construction of Park Central High School, and to restore it in the city park complex near the stadium. \\"My father wanted the stadium to serve all the schools of the Greater Bluefield area,\\" Nelson said during a telephone interview. She added that a program of all the games scheduled to be played at the stadium in 1954 included Bluefield, Graham and Park Central high school games as well as Bluefield State College games that season. \\" This was a stadium for all to use. I think that is something my father would have been most proud of,\\" Nelson said. In her letter to the city board, Nelson pointed out that history \\"gives richness and unique character to a city,\\" and urged the board to leave the stadium's name as it is. \\"It is not old fashioned to retain public recognition of a citizen who thought Bluefield was a very special place and who worked to make it even better,\\" she wrote. \\"Mitchell Stadium seems an appropriate recognition of a city manager with a vision of what the city could be.\\" Emory Mitchell died in office in 1951 and his widow died in 1975. The family lived in a home at 1003 Heatherwood. In 1953, West Virginia University and Virginia Tech played each other in Mitchell Stadium http://www.winsipedia.com/games/west-virginia/vs/virginia-tech. In 2007, the two schools returned to the venue with a soccer game. Bluefield State College in West Virginia played its home football games at Mitchell Stadium until discontinuing the program after the 1981 season. In the August 2007, new field turf was installed into the stadium by the June Shott Foundation. The same year they named the field after her. There have also been attempts to rename the stadium completely. In the summer of 2010, the Merrill Gainer Stadium Committee tried to get the stadiums name changed to Gainer Stadium in honor of legendary coach Merrill Gainer. Gainer coached at Bluefield High School from 1959–1967 and won 4 state championships. He later coached at Patrick Henry High School and won the 1973 Virginia AAA State Championship. The idea to change the name was eventually dropped because of a lack of interest from the public. In the fall of 2011, Bluefield College resumed playing football for the first time since 1941. The Rams began calling Mitchell Stadium home 2012. Bluefield College is a member of the NAIA in the Mid-South Conference along with being a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association. BC is steeped in a tradition like few others. University of Alabama All-American B.E. \\"Mullie\\" Lenoir leads Bluefield to prominence, recording an overall record of 79-18-2 over an 11-year span that included their first perfect season in 1933, 9-0, including wins over Concord (WV), Salem, and Appalachian State University while running back Pete Young led the nation in scoring with 128 points, prompting the popular singer/songwriter Rudy Vallée to write the song, \\"Mr. Touchdown USA\\". The Annual Beaver/Graham Game One of the biggest games of the year is the annual Beaver / Graham game. Around 12,000 people crowd the stadium from all over to watch the game. The Beavers have a winning record over the G-Men which is 62-23-2. The rivalry is so big that highlights of the game have been shown on \\"Scholastic Sports America\\" which used to air on ESPN. The Great American Rivalry Series has covered the game in recent years. In previous years, Bluefield fans would sit exclusively on the home side of the stadium. However, both teams call the stadium home, so recently the schools have sat on the home side in alternate years. _America's Best High School Football Stadium_ On November 4, 2019, Mitchell Stadium was selected as \\"America's Best High School Football Stadium\\" in a poll conducted by USA Today. Mitchell Stadium prevailed in a bracket-type poll which began with a field of sixteen stadiums located throughout the United States. Mitchell Stadium's opponents were: first round - Paul Brown Tiger Stadium, Massillon, Ohio; second round - Round Valley Ensphere, Eagar, Arizona; third round - Stadium Bowl, Tacoma, Washington; and final round - R.R. Jones Stadium, El Paso, Texas. In the final round, Mitchell earned nearly 60% of the final round vote, receiving a total of 2,149,143 votes to R.R. Jones’ 1,515,558 votes. Bluefield, West Virginia Mayor Ron Martin told the Bluefield Daily Telegraph that \\"This victory is a result of hillbilly voodoo.” Second Chance Rocks the Two Virginias In 2011, Mitchell Stadium hosted a music festival called \\"Second Chance Rocks the Two Virginias.\\" The festival was organized by partners of the Second Chance Learning Center, Erik Robinson and former MLB all-star pitcher Billy Wagner. Second Chance Learning Center gained most of the proceeds, in order to benefit area youth. The festival included country and country-rock acts, including Dierks Bentley, Montgomery Gentry, Craig Morgan, Justin Moore, Brantley Gilbert, Easton Corbin, and the local band Taylor Made. A group of teenagers also won a competition to be the opening act at the festival. Second Chance Rocks was a success, with almost 20,000 people in attendance, and was scheduled for a second year. The revised lineup for 2012 included Eric Church, Jake Owen, Lee Brice, and Folk Soul Revival. The Second Chance Learning Center held a YouTube competition for another opening act and it was won by Andy Crawford. A Nashville-based Bluefield native, Sarah Allison Turner, also opened the festival. June 29, 2012 recorded the hottest temperature in Bluefield history. A derecho hit the festival (the most costly storm in West Virginia history) shortly after Lee Brice's set, and the stadium was quickly evacuated. Jake Owen posted on his Twitter, \\"One of the very few nights in my career where we had to cancel due to weather. Sorry y'all. WV, we'll make it up to ya.\\" Owen kept his promise and came back on August 26 along with Eric Church. The concert took heat from people who had bought tickets because it was the day after the Bristol IRWIN Tools 500 and the night before the first day of school. The show went on and to the tune of a sell out and a concert was secured for 2013. The 2013 Second Chance concert was head lined by Justin Moore, the first act to return to the concert. Other acts were Craig Campbell, Shooter Jennings, JB and the Moonshine Band, Folk Soul Revival, and Clare Dunn. Bluefield College On Saturday, August 11, 2012, Bluefield College hosted its first media day for its football team. Bluefield Rams football was resurrected in 2011 after a 71-year-old hiatus. Bluefield Rams began play in 2012. Virginia Tech / WVU Football On November 7, 1953 Mitchell Stadium hosted the Virginia Tech Hokies and West Virginia Mountaineers. West Virginia Won this game 12-7. It was the only time West Virginia University and Virginia Tech played each other at Mitchell Stadium.

Biography  He was born on October 19, 1920 in near Peć, in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He finished elementary school in Peć in the Serbian language and due to his Catholic background attended the Catholic high school in Prizren, being one of few Albanians among mostly Croatians and Slovenes, finishing in 1941. After high school, he studied literature at the University of Padova, Italy and after World War II he studied geography and ethnography at the University of Belgrade. Krasniqi was a contributor to the Rilindja newspaper since 1945 in Prizren. After writing an article related to Marije Shllaku, he was accused of overpassing the nationalistic boundaries and his scholarship got cancelled. Despite that, he graduated in 1950. After his graduation, until the end of 1961, he worked in the Ethnographical Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, being one of few ethnic Albanians to receive a membership in that Academy. Since 1961 he lectured at the University of Pristina (now Universiteti i Prishtinës); he was also a member of Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo. Krasniqi earned his PhD in the University of Ljubljana in 1960. He published various studies and scientific books on ethnography and geography as well as textbooks. He was most widely known as a writer, especially for his poetry for children. Krasniqi was a member of the Assembly of Kosovo during the legislatures of 2001-2004, 2004-2007, and 2007-2010 representing Albanian Christian Democratic Party of Kosovo, part of respectively LDK, LDK, and LDD parliamentary groups.

In centralised systems, security is typically based on the authenticated identity of external parties. Rigid authentication mechanisms, such as Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) or Kerberos have allowed this model to be extended to distributed systems within a few closely collaborating domains or within a single administrative domain. During recent years, computer science has moved from centralised systems to distributed computing. This evolution has several implications for security models, policies and mechanisms needed to protect users’ information and resources in an increasingly interconnected computing infrastructure. Identity-based security mechanisms cannot authorise an operation without authenticating the claiming entity. This means that no interaction can occur unless both parties are known by their authentication frameworks. Spontaneous interactions would, therefore, require a single, or a few trusted certificate authorities (CAs). In the present context, PKI has not been considered since they have issues, thus it is unlikely that they will establish themselves as a reference standard in the near future. A user who wishes to collaborate with another party can choose between enabling security and thereby disabling spontaneous collaboration, or disabling security and enabling spontaneous collaboration. It is fundamental that mobile users and devices can authenticate in an autonomous way without relying on a common authentication infrastructure. In order to face this problem, we need to examine the challenges introduced by \\"global computing\\", a term coined by the EU for the future of the global information society, and to identify their impact on security. History Computational Trust applies the human notion of trust to the digital world, that is seen as malicious rather than cooperative. The expected benefits, according to Marsh et al., result in the use of others' ability through delegation, and in increased cooperation in an open and less protected environment. Research in the area of computational mechanisms for trust and reputation in virtual societies is directed towards increased reliability and performance of digital communities. A trust-based decision in a specific domain is a multi-stage process. The first step of this process consists in identifying and selecting the proper input data, that is, the trust evidence. In general, these are domain-specific and are derived from an analysis conducted over the application involved. In the next step, a trust computation is performed on the evidence to produce trust values, that means the estimation of the trustworthiness of entities in that particular domain. The selection of evidence and the subsequent trust computation are informed by a notion of trust defined in the trust model. Finally, the trust decision is taken by considering the computed values and exogenous factors, like disposition or risk assessments. Defining trust These concepts have heightened relevance in the last decade in computer science, particularly in the area of distributed artificial intelligence. The multi-agent system paradigm and the growth of e-commerce have increased interest in trust and reputation. In fact, trust and reputation systems have been recognized as the key factors for electronic commerce. These systems are used by intelligent software agents as an incentive in decision-making, when deciding whether or not to honor contracts, and as a mechanism to search trustworthy exchange partners. In particular, reputation is used in electronic markets as a trust- enforcing mechanism or as a method to avoid cheaters and frauds. Another area of application of these concepts in agent technology, is teamwork and cooperation. Several definitions of the human notion of trust have been proposed during the last years in different domains from sociology, psychology to political and business science. These definitions may even change in accordance with the application domain. For example, Romano's recent definition tries to encompass the previous work in all these domains: Trust and reputation both have a social value. When someone is trustworthy, that person may be expected to perform in a beneficial or at least not in a suspicious way that assure others, with high probability, good collaborations with him. On the contrary, when someone appears not to be trustworthy, others refrain from collaborating since there is a lower level of probability that these collaborations will be successful. Trust is strongly connected to confidence and it implies some degrees of uncertainty, hopefulness or optimism. Eventually, Marsh addressed the issue of formalizing trust as a computational concept in his PhD thesis. His trust model is based on social and psychological factors. Trust model classification A lot of proposals have appeared in the literature and here a selection of computational trust and reputation models, that represent a good sample of the current research, is presented. Trust and reputation can be analysed from different points of view and can be applied in many situations. The next classification is based considering the peculiar characteristics of these models and the environment where they evolve. =Conceptual model= Trust and reputation model can be characterized as: * Cognitive In models based on a cognitive approach, Trust and reputation are made up of underlying beliefs and are a function of the degree of these beliefs. The mental states, that lead to trust another agent or to assign a reputation, are an essential part of the model, as well as the mental consequences of the decision and the act of relying on another agent; * Neurological In neurological trust models based neurological theories on the interaction between affective and cognitive states are modeled on a neurological level as well by using theories on the embodiment of emotions. In these models the trust dynamics relate to experiences with (external) sources, both from a cognitive and affective perspective. More specifically for feeling the emotion associated to a mental state, converging recursive body loops are modeled. In addition, based on Hebbian learning (for the strength of the connections to the emotional responses) different adaptation processes are introduced, which are inspired by the Somatic Marker Hypothesis. * Game- theoretical Trust and reputation are considered subjective probabilities by which the individual A, expects the individual B to perform a given action on which its welfare depends. In this approach, trust and reputation are not the result of a mental state of the agent in a cognitive sense, but the result of a more pragmatic game with utility functions and numerical aggregation of past interactions. =Information sources= It is possible to sort out models by considering the information sources used to compute Trust and reputation values. The traditional information sources are direct experiences and witness information, but recent models have started to consider the connection between information and the sociological aspect of agent's behavior. When the model contains several information sources it can increase the reliability of the results, but conversely, it can increase the complexity of the model. Direct experiences Direct experience is the most relevant and reliable information source for a Trust/reputation model. Two types of direct experiences can be recognizable: * the experience based on the direct interaction with the interlocutor; * the experience based on the observed interaction of the other members of a community. Witness information Witness information, also called indirect information, is what comes from the experience of other members of community. It can be based on their own direct experience or on other data they gathered from others’ experience. Witness information is usually the most abundant but its use is complex for trust and reputation modelling. In fact, it introduces uncertainty and agents can manipulate or hide parts of the information for their own benefit. Sociological information People that belong to a community establish different types of relations. Each individual plays one or several roles in that society, influencing their behavior and the interaction with other people. In a multi-agent system, where there are plenty of interactions, the social relations among agents are a simplified reflection of the more complex relations of their human counterparts. Only a few trust and reputation models adopt this sociological information, using techniques like social network analysis. These methods study social relationships among individuals in a society that emerged as a set of methods for the analysis of social structures, methods that specifically allow an investigation of the relational aspects of these structures. Prejudice and bias Prejudice is another, though uncommon, mechanism that influences trust and reputation. According to this method, an individual is given properties of a particular group that make him recognisable as a member. These can be signs such as a uniform, a definite behavior, etc. As most people today use the word, prejudice refers to a negative or hostile attitude towards another social group, often racially defined. However, this negative connotation has to be revised when applied to agent communities. The set of signs used in computational trust and reputations models are usually out of the ethical discussion, differently from the signs used in human societies, like skin color or gender. Most of the literature in cognitive and social sciences claims that humans exhibit non-rational, biased behavior with respect to trust. Recently biased human trust models have been designed, analyzed and validated against empirical data. The results show that such biased trust models are able to predict human trust significantly better than unbiased trust models. Discussion on trust/reputation models The most relevant sources of information considered by the trust and reputation models presented before, are direct experiences and witness information. In e-markets, sociological information is almost non-existent and, in order to increase the efficiency of actual trust and reputation models, it should be considered. However, there is no reason to increase the complexity of models introducing trust evidence if, later, they have to be used in an environment where it is not possible to realise their capabilities. The aggregation of more trust and reputation evidence is useful in a computational model but it can increase its complexity making a general solution difficult. Several models are dependent on the characteristics of the environment and a possible solution could be the use of adaptive mechanisms that can modify how to combine different sources of information in a given environment. A lot of trust and reputation definitions have been presented and there are several works that give meaning to both concepts. There is a relation between both the concepts that should be considered in depth: reputation is a concept that helps to build trust on others. Nowadays, game theory is the predominant paradigm considered to design computational trust and reputation models. In all likelihood, this theory is taken into account because a significant number of economists and computer scientists, with a strong background in game theory and artificial intelligence techniques, are working in multi-agent and e-commerce contexts. Game theoretical models produce good results but may not be appropriate when the complexity of the agents, in terms of social relations and interaction increases, becomes too restrictive. The exploration of new possibilities should be considered and, for example, there should be a merging of cognitive approaches with game theoretical ones. Apart from that, more trust evidence should be considered, as well as time-sensitive trust metrics. represent the first step to encourage the improvement of computational trust. An important issue in modeling trust is represented by the transferability of trust judgements by different agents. Social scientists agree to consider unqualified trust values as not transferable, but a more pragmatic approach would conclude that qualified trust judgments are worth being transferred as far as decisions taken considering others’ opinion are better than the ones taken in isolation. In the authors investigated the problem of trust transferability in open distributed environments, proposing a translation mechanism able to make information exchanged from one agent to another more accurate and useful. Evaluation of trust models Currently, there is no commonly accepted evaluation framework or benchmark that would allow for a comparison of the models under a set of representative and common conditions. A game-theoretic approach in this direction has been proposed, where the configuration of a trust model is optimized assuming attackers with optimal attack strategies; this allows in a next step to compare the expected utility of different trust models. Similarly, a model-based analytical framework for predicting the effectiveness of reputation mechanisms against arbitrary attack models in arbitrary system models has been proposed for Peer-to-Peer systems.

He played first for Warwickshire, but later found much more success at Worcestershire, where (unlike at his original county) he became the usual wicket-keeper. He was the son of England Test player Willie Quaife. Quaife made his first-class debut for Warwickshire against Somerset at Bath in June 1920; he scored 11 and 20. He played off and on for the next couple of years, though made no significant scores. One remarkable incident occurred in 1922, when Warwickshire played Derbyshire: Billy Bestwick and his son Robert bowled for Derbyshire against Willie Quaife and his son Bernard. Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1985. He had a better year in 1923, playing regularly and almost making a maiden hundred against Northamptonshire: he was 99 not out in the first innings when he ran out of partners. He also took the first of his small haul of wickets when he dismissed Worcestershire's William Fox in late May. However, this season was to be a one-off: the 704 runs he made easily exceeded the aggregate from his other six summers at Edgbaston, and after 1926 he left Warwickshire. Quaife played not at all in 1927, making his Worcestershire debut the following June against Sussex and hitting 77 not out in the first innings. He ended the year with over 900 first-class runs at a little under 26, including his long-awaited first century: 136 not out versus Glamorgan at the start of August. Quaife captained Worcestershire for the first time in this game, as he was to do frequently later in his career. He was not at this point the regular wicket-keeper. That position did not fall to him until 1929, there then being no keeper already in the side, though he did stand in two other matches in 1928. From 1929 until the end of his career in 1937, Quaife was a regular in the Worcestershire side. His batting, said his Wisden obituarist, was \\"solid and consistent rather than brilliant\\", but he still managed to pass a thousand runs for the season on two occasions, in 1933 and 1935, and to score two further hundreds. He made 107 against Middlesex in 1931, sharing a fourth-wicket stand of 277 with Harold Gibbons (183); this remains the record Worcestershire partnership against Middlesex for any wicket. He also struck 109 versus Leicestershire in 1935. By 1937, Syd Buller had taken over behind the stumps for Worcestershire, and Quaife was coming under pressure from other, younger players. He retired at the end of the season, although he acted as captain for a large number of games in the absence through illness of usual captain Charles Lyttelton for most of the summer. Apart from his Test-playing father, Quaife had one other notable cricketing relative: his uncle, Walter Quaife, played over 200 first-class games, mainly for Sussex and Warwickshire, between 1884 and 1901.

Biography Laurien Hoos was born out of a total athletics family. Almost everybody from her mother's side of the family has been active in the sport as well.Over Laurien Hoos , laurienhoos.nl, ret: Aug 4, 2008 After she got her swimming degrees at the age of six she was allowed to start in athletics as well. She started training twice a week at Atletiekvereniging Hera, which is still her team nowadays. She has an older brother Jeroen (11 June 1979) and a younger sister Lisanne (2 July 1987). When Hoos reached the level of D-junior she added two speciality training opportunities to her schedule as she started to practice as a hurdler and to practice for the throwing disciplines in the sport. She did these extra training sessions once in two weeks. Through the years the training sessions became more intense and more professional, resulting in an invitation for the national heptathlon selection of the Netherlands in the end of 1997. After participating in several international junior nation challenges Hoos was invited for her first senior meeting in 2001 when she took part in the European Cup in Ried, Austria. During this event she reached the limits that were needed to participate in the European Junior Championships, but because there were two other Dutch athletes who did the same and who got higher scores she was still sidelined for the tournament. In 2002, she managed to qualify herself for the World Junior Championships in Kingston, Jamaica. After the first day she was on the 4th position in the rankings. Due to three errors at the long jump the following day she was set back in the rankings, resulting in disappointment. Also during the European Cup in 2002 as well as the Dutch National Championships in 2003 she managed to make three errors at the long jump. Her next mission was the European Cup 2003 in Tallinn, Estonia where she got rid of the negativity surrounding her performances. She qualified for the European Under-23 Championships with 5592 points, which was a new personal best with 180 points. During the European Championships she impressed with a 7th position overall. After the summer she started doing extra long jump training sessions and later she also got extra high jump and hurdle jump sessions. In 2004, she did not take part in any notable tournaments, but she did manage to become the best Dutch athlete at the European Cup meeting in Hengelo where she improved her personal best to 5631 points. At the en d of the year she broke up with coach Peter Winkel and found a new coach in the person of Joseph Sweeney. The training sessions became even more intense and the progression was visible straight away. At the 5 nations tournament in Clermont-Ferrand in February 2005 she improved her personal best at four out of five pentathlon disciplines and improved her pentathlon record with 300 points. Due to this result she was invited to take part in the European Indoor Championships in Madrid where she reached a 10th position. At the Dutch National Championships she won the gold medal at the 60m hurdles. The European Indoor Championship result gave her an invitation for the heptathlon meeting in Götzis where her personal best of 5631 was far beyond the other invited athletes. During the event Hoos impressed with a massive score of 6214 points, bringing her straight among the world class performers and even breaking Karin Ruckstuhl's national record. Ruckstuhl however also improved her personal best during the same event and gained even more points than the Hoos's final result. Still she could consider herself as the Dutch 2nd athlete at the heptathlon. At the end of 2004 she was 97th in the World rankings, but after her performances in Gotzis she was 9th in the World and was she the athlete to beat at the European Under-23 Championships in Erfurt. In Erfurt she was capable of performing to her standards and she won the gold medal with a new personal best score of 6291 points. Besides winning the gold she also broke the Championship record as well as the Dutch national under-23 record. During the event in Götzis she also reached the limits for the World Championships that were held in Helsinki. During the second event, the high jump, she suffered an injury and had to cancel the rest of the event. The injury she suffered in Helsinki was just a start for more physical disappointments. In January 2006 she damaged her quadriceps femoris muscle and in April 2006 she damaged her ankle at three different spots, which meant the end of her 2006 season. She made her comeback in Götzis in 2007, but due to bronchitis and sinusitis she only reached a total of 6061 points during that event. That result was however enough to qualify for the World Championships in Osaka, but in the last week before the deadline a third Dutch athlete, Yvonne Wisse improved Hoos's score and as there were only three tickets (the others went to Ruckstuhl and Jolanda Keizer) available she was unable to go to Japan. Instead of participating at the World Championships she competed at an international event in Woerden and she won the meeting with 6199 points, which was enough for an Olympic nomination. At the end of 2007 Hoos decided to move to France to live with her partner and fellow athlete Rudy Bourguignon in Amiens. She divided her time over both France and the Netherlands to a 50-50 scale, but had to say goodbye to coach Arno Mul as Bourguignon's coach Jean-Paul Bourdon would take over from him. To qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics Hoos only needed to score a total of 5800 points in 2008 due to her performance in Woerden. At the international meeting in Arles she scored 5961 points and finished second, which was enough to secure her Olympic debut in Beijing. To refine some of her disciplines on the road to China she focused a bit more on the shot put and on the hurdles, resulting in two bronze medals at the Dutch National Championships.

Biography Westwood lost one of his eyes in a car accident in 1956. As a result, he wore an eye patch for the rest of his life. Upon the death of his father in 1953, he inherited his father's title and estate. Lord Westwood followed his father, seven years after the death of his father, into the Newcastle United boardroom in 1960. Three years later he became chairman and was to hold the post for the next 18 years. The colourful chairman was at the helm the last time the club captured a meaningful trophy, the 1969 Inter- Cities Fairs Cup. In that time he was voted president of the Football League in 1974, vice-chairman of the Football Association and served on the UEFA professional committee. Lord Westwood was known as a man who dominated the boardroom with his razor sharp wit, a talent which made him an outstanding after dinner speaker and a captivating conversationalist. Despite his good record as chairman he resigned from the board under controversial circumstances in 1981. Newcastle United were in dire straits and each director had been asked to put a £16,000 guarantee into the club to help finances. Lord Westwood had just been hit with a big financial loss following the stock market collapse of DCM, Europe's leading toy company, of which he was also chairman, and he refused to dig any deeper in helping out Newcastle United. Hornby Railways released a model Hall Class Locomotive in 1973 and 1974 called Lord Westwood. The lowest point in his stint as chairman was in the crisis- torn year of 1977, when six leading first team players threatened to quit the club after contract talks broke down. Amid allegations of back-stabbing in the boardroom, when Lord Westwood, claimed himself and the then just sacked manager Richard Dinnis were being knifed in the back, he ordered a complete ban of every Newcastle United employee, especially the players, from talking to the press. After a string of defeats, Newcastle went down 2–1 to Arsenal at St James Park and hundreds of demonstrators called for the chairman's resignation with angry shouts of Westwood out. Many fans fought among themselves in the Leazes End and there were 10 arrests. Lord Westwood died on 8 November 1991.

Directly prior to The Beatles' first American visit, Brian Epstein wanted someone to manage the escalating volume of merchandising requests that NEMS found itself unable to cope with, and asked his lawyer, David Jacobs, to oversee this task. Jacobs knew Nicky Byrne and asked him if he would be interested in taking over the merchandising subdivision from NEMS altogether, paying NEMS a commission. Byrne accepted the offer subject to a 90% rate, leaving only 10% for the Beatles and NEMS combined. Completely unaware of the potential market that existed, particularly in America, Epstein agreed to the deal, and subsequently lost The Beatles an estimated $100,000,000 in possible income. In December 1963 Byrne took over the control of Stramsact in the UK, and then set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelt backwards) in the United States. Epstein was able to renegotiate a more favourable commission of 49% in August 1964, but then became embroiled in a three-year court battle with Byrne regarding payment of monies due, during which time potential sponsors lost interest. In August 1967 Epstein died, from what was ruled an accidental overdose of a prescribed drug. Jacobs was found hanged in his garage on 15 December 1968. Byrne later retired to the Bahamas. Merchandising Before the Beatles achieved nationwide success in Britain, Epstein had permitted a small company (run by his cousins, and which initially catered only to fan club members)Mojo Magazine (2002). Special Limited Edition # M-04951 , p. 100. to produce Beatles' sweaters for 30 shillings and badges for six pence, eventually selling 15,000 sweaters and 50,000 badges as the Beatles' popularity grew. When Beatlemania stormed the UK in 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies wanting to use The Beatles' name and images on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts and a huge variety of assorted merchandise. Epstein was adamant that the Beatles would not directly endorse any product, but through NEMS Enterprises he would grant discretionary licences to companies who were able to produce a quality product at a fair price, although many companies were already selling products without a licence. When NEMS was swamped with offers of endorsements from America following the success of \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\", Epstein, who was usually meticulous in matters involving the Beatles, decided to delegate this responsibility as he felt it was distracting him from his main task of managing his expanding roster of artists. He then asked Jacobs, his London- based, Hove-living celebrity lawyer (Jacobs's other clients included Marlene Dietrich, Diana Dors, Judy Garland, Liberace and Laurence Harvey) to appoint someone specifically to take over the assignment and gave Jacobs power of attorney in the matter. Jacobs at first handed the daily management of this to his chief clerk, Edward Marke, but it transpired that Marke knew almost nothing about the merchandising business, and so Jacobs was forced to look elsewhere. Jacobs knew of a Chelsea socialite, a 37-year-old divorcé called Nicky Byrne, and when encountering him at a friend's cocktail party offered him the project, saying that \\"Brian [Epstein] has made a terrible mess out of this [merchandising].\\" Byrne, who has said he had been \\"sitting around doing nothing for half of 1963\\" was an ex-Horse Guard trooper and amateur racing driver. He had also previously been involved in music publishing, clothes design, theatre production, managing the Condor club in London, and was also known as being a part of a group of people who called themselves \\"The King's Road Rats\\". He had not had any previous experience of merchandising or managing a large business. Byrne was at first reluctant but later agreed, and delivered the merchandising contract to Jacobs's office on 4 December 1963, leaving blank the percentages. Jacobs asked Byrne what percentage rate he should write down to which Byrne ambiguously replied: \\"Oh, look, just put in 10%.\\" A typical percentage would have been 75% or 80% for NEMS, and Byrne expected Epstein would begin to negotiate. However, the contract came back initialled (meaning Epstein had read it) and signed by Epstein and Jacobs. Jacobs's advice to Epstein was, \\"10% is better than nothing\\". This lapse of shrewdness set the scene for what would later become a legal battleground which deprived the Beatles and Brian Epstein of such large sums of money they would have easily overshadowed any royalties they would receive in the medium term from the sale of records. Byrne later said: \\"They couldn't wait to get somebody else to do this, because they were in a mess themselves.\\" Epstein would later realise that he had made a colossal error of judgment, as Byrne charged 10% commission to the merchandisers for a licence (receiving $10 out of every hundred) and then giving 10% of that to NEMS, which was $1. A Beatles' badge, licensed by the Seltaeb company Byrne controlled two companies: Stramsact in the UK and Europe, and Seltaeb in the USA. He invited five friends to become partners — four of whom were unknown to either Jacobs or Epstein — with each investing around $1,600. They were: Mark Warman, Simon Miller-Munday, John Fenton (a business acquaintance of Jacobs) Peregrine Eliot (heir to the ninth Earl of St Germans)The Times: \\"$1 Million lawsuit\\" (9 December 1964) and Malcolm Evans (not to be confused with Mal Evans, the Beatles' roadie). During the first Beatles' flight to America Epstein was offered numerous samples of products by merchandisers who required a licence to be allowed to sell them such as clocks, pens, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games. Epstein rejected all of them; directing the merchandisers to Byrne instead, who was already in New York ensconced in The Drake Hotel on Park Avenue at 56th Street. Byrne rented expensive offices on Fifth Avenue, hiring two limousines (on 24-hour standby) and a helicopter to fly clients to and from the airport, insisting that only the presidents of merchandising companies were allowed to talk directly with him, or with his partner, Lord Eliot, who helped to promote the company name with use of his title. Eliot would later recall going to the Seltaeb office once or twice a week to draw $1,000 from petty cash. The Wall Street Journal predicted that American teenagers would spend $50 million during 1964, on wigs, dolls, egg cups, T-shirts, sweatshirts and narrow-legged pants, and the New York Times wrote that the Reliance Manufacturing Company's factories were \\"smoking night and day ... to meet demand\\", and had already sold products valued at the retail value of $2.5 million. The Reliant Shirt Corporation paid $100,000 for a licence and sold over a million Beatle T-shirts in three days, Remco Toys had produced 100,000 Beatles' dolls and had orders for another 500,000, and the Lowell Toy Corporation were selling Beatle wigs faster than they could produce them, at more than 35,000 per day. Seltaeb licensed over 150 different items internationally: Beatle dolls, scarves, mugs, bath water, wigs, T-shirts, bubble gum, liquorice, empty cans of \\"Beatle Breath\\", badges, and many more. The badges had \\"Seltaeb 1964 Chicago Made in USA\\" on one side, and \\"Green Duck Co., Chicago Made in USA\\" on the other. (The Green Duck metal stamping company was based at 1520 West Montana, Chicago, operating from 1906 until the late 1960s, making election badges for politicians, as well as memorial spoons). American businessmen saw The Beatles' merchandising as the \\"biggest marketing opportunity since Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse\\". The Columbia Pictures Corporation offered to buy Byrne's share in the companies for $500,000, with the incentives that the money would be paid into a low-tax offshore bank account in the Bahamas, Byrne and his partners would retain 50% control of the companies, and Ferrari cars would be given free to every partner, but Byrne turned down the offer. Percentages and court cases Byrne passed on the first cheque for $9,700 to Epstein, who was impressed, but after innocently asking how much out of the amount Byrne was owed, was told, \\"Nothing Brian, that's your 10%\\". Byrne then went on to describe the massive amount of interest he was getting from companies across the USA. Epstein was horrified, realising he had made an appalling error by accepting such a small percentage, and decided he could never tell The Beatles. He immediately instructed Jacobs to re-negotiate the contract with Byrne, which was finally achieved seven months later, in August 1964, which raised the royalty to 49%. In The Times on 9 December 1964, it was reported that Eliot was suing Byrne for damages of $1 million. Eliot accused Byrne of spending $150,000 for his \\"personal comfort and benefit\\", over some months. The suit also accused Byrne of charging hotel bills to Seltaeb, which were as much as $19,000 every week for girlfriends, and also opening \\"charge accounts for them in Fifth Avenue shops\\". Eliot also alleged that Byrne had hired a chauffeur for $700 a week and had withheld $55,000 in royalties to NEMS, after which NEMS had said they would cancel the agreement between the two companies unless monies were forthcoming. Byrne denied all the charges, but admitted he had hired a chauffeur, as he was not familiar with the streets of New York. A supreme court judge reserved his decision. Epstein accused Seltaeb of not accounting properly, and cancelled its power to grant licences, which started a counter-lawsuit by Byrne against Epstein's New York accountant, Walter Hofer, asking for $5,168,000 in damages. Epstein then instructed NEMS employees to deal directly with American companies, so Byrne instigated court proceedings, which took three years to settle, as it entailed 39 individual claims against NEMS. Byrne won the case, and Epstein paid the court costs and legal bills himself, although the judgement was later vacated; meaning to cancel it, or render it null and void. Due to the legal battle, Woolworth's, J. C. Penney, and other companies refused to finalise any merchandising agreements, cancelling orders worth $78 million. The court case and its effect was estimated to have lost NEMS and The Beatles approximately $100,000,000. Maximus Enterprises Epstein, in 1967, launched Maximus Enterprises Ltd., to try to capitalise on the merchandising boom,Ballantyne, Maddy. Q Collectors Limited Edition, p61 but as so many companies had withdrawn their interest in the wake of the Seltaeb fiasco, and Lennon had angered America's bible belt with his remark suggesting that The Beatles were \\"more popular than Jesus\\", the opportunity had passed. Epstein feared that the Beatles would not renew their contracts with him—due to expire in the Autumn of 1967—if they discovered the truth about Seltaeb. Epstein's problems with Seltaeb would remain with him until his death on 27 August 1967, from what was ruled an accidental overdose of a prescribed drug. Many investors had also missed out on massive profits following the cancelling of contracts, and Byrne would later claim of having received two mysterious phone calls foretelling of Epstein's death. Jacobs was found hanged in his garage on 15 December 1968. Days before his death Jacobs had asked for police protection, telling a private detective, \\"I'm in terrible trouble, they're all after me,\\" and going on to list six well-known showbusiness people. Byrne retired to the Bahamas on his yacht, later moving to the Trowbridge area of Wiltshire. Aftermath At the time, very few managers of pop groups knew about the income music merchandising could generate, as very few artists survived long enough in the pop domain to be a viable investment. As far as Epstein was concerned it was merely good public relations, and any revenue that arose from the sale of Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as merely extra money that supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and record sales. Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone. Alistair Taylor (Epstein's assistant) later admitted that financial mistakes were made: \\"We did our best; some people have said it wasn't good enough. That's easy to say with 20/20 hindsight but remember that there were no rules. We were making it up as we went along.\\" In America, Epstein had met the well-known divorce lawyer, Nat Weiss, whom Epstein later asked to take over the merchandising affairs of the Beatles and NEMS. Weiss would later state, \\"The reality is that the Beatles never saw a penny out of the merchandising ... Tens of millions of dollars went down the drain because of the way the whole thing was mishandled. Even after the judgement was vacated, you could smell the smoke from the ashes, that's how badly they had been burned.\\" Beatles' memorabilia, licensed by Seltaeb, is still sold at Beatles' conventions and on the internet. Lennon said years later: \\"On the business end he [Epstein] ripped us off on the Seltaeb thing.\\" McCartney also said: \\"He [Epstein] looked to his dad for business advice, and his dad knew how to run a furniture store in Liverpool.\\" NotesReferences     External links *John Lennon's Secret (book) *The mistakes *When Big Money is Involved, Nobody Thinks Straight.

Life She was the daughter of Joseph Goetz of Strasburg and Marie Anne Wagner;her parents dying early, her education was left to the care of an aunt who sent her to school at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Besançon. At the age of seventeen she entered the novitiate of the Sacred Heart at Montet and took her first vows in 1837. In 1842 she was entrusted with the charge of the school at Besançon, which was going through a difficult phase, and showed judicious management. Immediately after profession in 1847 she was appointed mistress of novices at Conflans, Charenton-le-Pont. She continued in this charge, to which was afterwards added the government of the house as superior, until 1864, when she was named vicar-general. The failing strength of Sophie Barat, who founded the Society, made it necessary for her to have some one at hand, to whom she could communicate her views for the future. She found a full understanding of them in Mother Josephine Goetz, who was elected superior-general in 1865. Mother Goetz governed as superior-general for nine years. Her work was principally one of consolidation. She established a training school at Conflans to prepare the young religious for their duties as teachers, and entrusted to a small committee the revision and adaptation of the curriculum of studies to the growing needs of the order. During the Franco-Prussian war and the time of the siege and Commune in Paris, Reverend Mother Goetz was obliged to withdraw to Laval, that communications with her religious might not be cut off. She made visitations of the houses then existing in Europe, as far as time and health permitted - but her strength rapidly failed and she died from a stroke of paralysis, after a few days' illness.

The theorem was first obtained in a 1940 article of GrushkoI. A. Grushko, On the bases of a free product of groups, Matematicheskii Sbornik, vol 8 (1940), pp. 169-182. and then, independently, in a 1943 article of Neumann.B. H. Neumann. On the number of generators of a free product. Journal of the London Mathematical Society, vol 18, (1943), pp. 12-20. Statement of the theorem Let A and B be finitely generated groups and let A∗B be the free product of A and B. Then :rank(A∗B) = rank(A) + rank(B). It is obvious that rank(A∗B) ≤ rank(A) + rank(B) since if X is a finite generating set of A and Y is a finite generating set of B then X∪Y is a generating set for A∗B and that X∪Y≤X + Y. The opposite inequality, rank(A∗B) ≥ rank(A) + rank(B), requires proof. Grushko, but not Neumann, proved a more precise version of Grushko's theorem in terms of Nielsen equivalence. It states that if M = (g1, g2, ..., gn) is an n-tuple of elements of G = A∗B such that M generates G, 1, g2, ..., gn> = G, then M is Nielsen equivalent in G to an n-tuple of the form :M' = (a1, ..., ak, b1, ..., bn−k) where {a1, ..., ak}⊆A is a generating set for A and where {b1, ..., bn−k}⊆B is a generating set for B. In particular, rank(A) ≤ k, rank(B) ≤ n − k and rank(A) + rank(B) ≤ k + (n − k) = n. If one takes M to be the minimal generating tuple for G, that is, with n = rank(G), this implies that rank(A) + rank(B) ≤ rank(G). Since the opposite inequality, rank(G) ≤ rank(A) + rank(B), is obvious, it follows that rank(G)=rank(A) + rank(B), as required. History and generalizations After the original proofs of Grushko (1940) and Neumann(1943), there were many subsequent alternative proofs, simplifications and generalizations of Grushko's theorem.

The argument directly inspired the machinery of foldings for group actions on trees and for graphs of groups and Dicks' even more straightforward proof of Grushko's theorem (see, for example, Warren Dicks.

Grushko's theorem is, in a sense, a starting point in Dunwoody's theory of accessibility for finitely generated and finitely presented groups. Since the ranks of the free factors are smaller than the rank of a free product, Grushko's theorem implies that the process of iterated splitting of a finitely generated group G as a free product must terminate in a finite number of steps (more precisely, in at most rank(G) steps). There is a natural similar question for iterating splittings of finitely generated groups over finite subgroups. Dunwoody proved that such a process must always terminate if a group G is finitely presentedMartin J.

Grushko decomposition theorem A useful consequence of the original Grushko theorem is the so-called Grushko decomposition theorem. It asserts that any nontrivial finitely generated group G can be decomposed as a free product :G = A1∗A2∗...∗Ar∗Fs, where s ≥ 0, r ≥ 0, where each of the groups Ai is nontrivial, freely indecomposable (that is, it cannot be decomposed as a free product) and not infinite cyclic, and where Fs is a free group of rank s; moreover, for a given G, the groups A1, ..., Ar are unique up to a permutation of their conjugacy classes in G (and, in particular, the sequence of isomorphism types of these groups is unique up to a permutation) and the numbers s and r are unique as well. More precisely, if G = B1∗...∗Bk∗Ft is another such decomposition then k = r, s = t, and there exists a permutation σ∈Sr such that for each i=1,...,r the subgroups Ai and Bσ(i) are conjugate in G. The existence of the above decomposition, called the Grushko decomposition of G, is an immediate corollary of the original Grushko theorem, while the uniqueness statement requires additional arguments (see, for exampleJohn Stallings. Coherence of 3-manifold fundamental groups. Séminaire Bourbaki, 18 (1975-1976), Exposé No. 481.). Algorithmically computing the Grushko decomposition for specific classes of groups is a difficult problem which primarily requires being able to determine if a given group is freely decomposable. Positive results are available for some classes of groups such as torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups, certain classes of relatively hyperbolic groups,François Dahmani and Daniel Groves. \\"Detecting free splittings in relatively hyperbolic groups\\".

Grushko decomposition theorem is a group-theoretic analog of the Kneser prime decomposition theorem for 3-manifolds which says that a closed 3-manifold can be uniquely decomposed as a connected sum of irreducible 3-manifolds.H. Kneser, Geschlossene Flächen in dreidimensionalen Mannigfaltigkeiten. Jahresber. Deutsch. Math. Verein., vol. 38 (1929), pp. 248-260 Sketch of the proof using Bass–Serre theory The following is a sketch of the proof of Grushko's theorem based on the use of foldings techniques for groups acting on trees (see for complete proofs using this argument). Let S={g1,....,gn} be a finite generating set for G=A∗B of size S=n=rank(G). Realize G as the fundamental group of a graph of groups Y which is a single non-loop edge with vertex groups A and B and with the trivial edge group. Let \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf Y} be the Bass–Serre covering tree for Y. Let F=F(x1,....,xn) be the free group with free basis x1,....,xn and let φ0:F → G be the homomorphism such that φ0(xi)=gi for i=1,...,n. Realize F as the fundamental group of a graph Z0 which is the wedge of n circles that correspond to the elements x1,....,xn. We also think of Z0 as a graph of groups with the underlying graph Z0 and the trivial vertex and edge groups. Then the universal cover \\\\tilde Z_0 of Z0 and the Bass–Serre covering tree for Z0 coincide. Consider a φ0-equivariant map r_0:\\\\tilde Z_0\\\\to \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf Y} so that it sends vertices to vertices and edges to edge-paths. This map is non-injective and, since both the source and the target of the map are trees, this map \\"folds\\" some edge-pairs in the source. The graph of groups Z0 serves as an initial approximation for Y. We now start performing a sequence of \\"folding moves\\" on Z0 (and on its Bass- Serre covering tree) to construct a sequence of graphs of groups Z0, Z1, Z2, ...., that form better and better approximations for Y. Each of the graphs of groups Zj has trivial edge groups and comes with the following additional structure: for each nontrivial vertex group of it there assigned a finite generating set of that vertex group. The complexity c(Zj) of Zj is the sum of the sizes of the generating sets of its vertex groups and the rank of the free group π1(Zj). For the initial approximation graph we have c(Z0)=n. The folding moves that take Zj to Zj+1 can be of one of two types: *folds that identify two edges of the underlying graph with a common initial vertex but distinct end-vertices into a single edge; when such a fold is performed, the generating sets of the vertex groups and the terminal edges are \\"joined\\" together into a generating set of the new vertex group; the rank of the fundamental group of the underlying graph does not change under such a move. *folds that identify two edges, that already had common initial vertices and common terminal vertices, into a single edge; such a move decreases the rank of the fundamental group of the underlying graph by 1 and an element that corresponded to the loop in the graph that is being collapsed is \\"added\\" to the generating set of one of the vertex groups. One sees that the folding moves do not increase complexity but they do decrease the number of edges in Zj. Therefore, the folding process must terminate in a finite number of steps with a graph of groups Zk that cannot be folded any more. It follows from the basic Bass–Serre theory considerations that Zk must in fact be equal to the edge of groups Y and that Zk comes equipped with finite generating sets for the vertex groups A and B. The sum of the sizes of these generating sets is the complexity of Zk which is therefore less than or equal to c(Z0)=n. This implies that the sum of the ranks of the vertex groups A and B is at most n, that is rank(A)+rank(B)≤rank(G), as required. Sketch of Stalling's proof Stallings' proof of Grushko Theorem follows from the following lemma. Lemma Let F be finitely generated free group, with n generators. Let G1 and G2 be two finitely presented groups. Suppose there exists a surjective homomorphism \\\\phi:F\\\\rightarrow G_1\\\\ast G_2, then there exists two subgroups F1 and F2 of F with \\\\phi(F_1)=G_1 and \\\\phi(F_2)=G_2 such that F=F_1\\\\ast F_2. Proof: We give the proof assuming that F has no generator which is mapped to the identity of G_1\\\\ast G_2, for if there are such generators, they may be added to any of F_1 or F_2. The following general results are used in the proof. 1\\\\. There is a one or two dimensional CW complex, Z with fundamental group F. By Van Kampen theorem, the wedge of n circles is one such space. 2\\\\. There exists a two complex X=X_1\\\\cup X_2 where {p}=X_1\\\\cap X_2 is a point on a one cell of X such that X1 and X2 are two complexes with fundamental groups G1 and G2 respectively. Note that by the Van Kampen theorem, this implies that the fundamental group of X is G_1\\\\ast G_2. 3\\\\. There exists a map f:Z\\\\rightarrow X such that the induced map f_\\\\ast on the fundamental groups is same as \\\\phi For the sake of convenience, let us denote f^{-1}(X_1)=:Z_1 and f^{-1}(X_2)=:Z_2. Since no generator of F maps to identity, the set Z_1\\\\cap Z_2 has no loops, for if it does, these will correspond to circles of Z which map to p\\\\in X, which in turn correspond to generators of F which go to the identity. So, the components of Z_1\\\\cap Z_2 are contractible. In the case where Z_1\\\\cap Z_2 has only one component, by Van Kampen's theorem, we are done, as in that case, :F=\\\\Pi_1(Z_1)\\\\ast\\\\Pi_1(Z_2). The general proof follows by reducing Z to a space homotopically equivalent to it, but with fewer components in Z_1\\\\cap Z_2, and thus by induction on the components of Z_1\\\\cap Z_2. Such a reduction of Z is done by attaching discs along binding ties. We call a map \\\\gamma :[0,1]\\\\rightarrow Z a binding tie if it satisfies the following properties 1\\\\. It is monochromatic i.e. \\\\gamma([0,1])\\\\subseteq Z_1 or \\\\gamma([0,1])\\\\subseteq Z_2 2\\\\. It is a tie i.e. \\\\gamma(0) and \\\\gamma(1) lie in different components of Z_1\\\\cap Z_2. 3\\\\. It is null i.e. f \\\\circ \\\\gamma([0,1]) is null homotopic in X. Let us assume that such a binding tie exists. Let \\\\gamma be the binding tie. Consider the map g:[0,1]\\\\rightarrow D^2 given by g(t)= e^{it}. This map is a homeomorphism onto its image. Define the space Z^' as :Z'= Z \\\\coprod! D^2/! \\\\sim where :x!!\\\\sim y \\\\text{ iff} \\\\begin{cases} x=y, \\\\mbox{ or }\\\\ x=\\\\gamma (t) \\\\text{ and } y= g(t) \\\\text{ for some } t\\\\in [0,1]\\\\mbox{ or }\\\\ x=g (t) \\\\text{ and } y= \\\\gamma (t) \\\\text{ for some } t\\\\in [0,1] \\\\end{cases} Note that the space Z' deformation retracts to Z We first extend f to a function f^{}:Z\\\\coprod \\\\partial D^2/!\\\\sim as : f^{}(x) = \\\\begin{cases}f(x),\\\\ x\\\\in Z\\\\ p \\\\text{ otherwise.}\\\\end{cases} Since the f(\\\\gamma) is null homotopic, f further extends to the interior of the disc, and therefore, to Z^' . Let Z_i^' = f^{'-1}(X_i) i = 1,2. As \\\\gamma(0) and \\\\gamma(1) lay in different components of Z_1\\\\cap Z_2, Z_1^'\\\\cap Z_2^' has one less component than Z_1\\\\cap Z_2. Construction of binding tie The binding tie is constructed in two steps. Step 1: Constructing a null tie: Consider a map \\\\gamma' :[0,1]\\\\rightarrow Z with \\\\gamma' (0) and \\\\gamma' (1) in different components of Z_1\\\\cap Z_2. Since f_\\\\ast is surjective, there exits a loop !\\\\lambda based at γ'(1) such that ! f(\\\\gamma') and ! f(\\\\lambda) are homotopically equivalent in X. If we define a curve \\\\gamma :[0,1]\\\\rightarrow Z as \\\\gamma(t)= \\\\gamma'\\\\ast\\\\lambda(t) for all t\\\\in [0,1], then !\\\\gamma is a null tie. Step 2: Making the null tie monochromatic: The tie !\\\\gamma may be written as \\\\gamma_1\\\\ast \\\\gamma_2\\\\ast \\\\cdots \\\\ast\\\\gamma_m where each \\\\gamma_i is a curve in Z_1 or Z_2 such that if \\\\gamma_i is in Z_1, then \\\\gamma_{i+1} is in Z_2 and vice versa. This also implies that f(\\\\gamma_i) is a loop based at p in X. So, : [e]=[f(\\\\gamma)]=[f(\\\\gamma_1)]\\\\ast\\\\cdots\\\\ast [f(\\\\gamma_m)] Hence, [f(\\\\gamma_j)]=[e] for some j. If this !\\\\gamma_j is a tie, then we have a monochromatic, null tie. If !\\\\gamma_j is not a tie, then the end points of !\\\\gamma_j are in the same component of Z_1\\\\cap Z_2. In this case, we replace !\\\\gamma_j by a path in Z_1\\\\cap Z_2, say !\\\\gamma_j'. This path may be appended to !\\\\gamma_{j-1} and we get a new null tie \\\\gamma = \\\\gamma_1\\\\ast \\\\cdots \\\\ast \\\\gamma_{j-1}'\\\\ast\\\\gamma_{j+1} \\\\cdots \\\\gamma_m, where !\\\\gamma_{j-1}' = \\\\gamma_{j-1}\\\\ast\\\\gamma_j'. Thus, by induction on m, we prove the existence of a binding tie. Proof of Grushko theorem Suppose that G = A*B is generated by {g_1, g_2,\\\\ldots, g_n}. Let F be the free group with n-generators, viz. {f_1, f_2,\\\\ldots, f_n}. Consider the homomorphism h:F\\\\rightarrow G given by h(f_i) = g_i, where i=1,\\\\ldots, n. By the lemma, there exists free groups F_1 and F_2 with F=F_1\\\\ast F_2 such that h(F_1)=A and h(F_2)=B. Therefore, \\\\text{Rank }(A) \\\\leq \\\\text{Rank }(F_1) and \\\\text{Rank }(B) \\\\leq \\\\text{Rank }(F_2). Therefore, \\\\text{Rank }(A) + \\\\text{Rank }(B)\\\\leq\\\\text{Rank }(F_1) + \\\\text{Rank }(F_2) = \\\\text{Rank }(F) = \\\\text{Rank } (A\\\\ast B).

He is proud to have Antoine Le Grand Batard de Bourgogne (1421-1504) *, painted by Rogier van der Weyden as well as by Hans Memling, as a direct ancestor. Early life and education Listed in the Who is Who in the East 1986/7, he was born in 1933 on Java, then the Dutch East Indies, grandson of Prof. Guillaume Frédéric Rochat (1876–1965) and son of Dr. Guillaume Frédéric Rochat and attorney-at-law Bertha Rochat. Gui Rochat was educated at the Latin and Greek Gymnasium school in Zwolle, The Netherlands, from 1946 to 1953, after which he entered the Dutch navy in the training program for reserve lieutenant. Following a short unsuccessful spell of being a cadet in the Dutch Naval Academy he entered Groningen University in the Netherlands 1956 as a student in Medicine.

Haas estate, now in the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco *, which included the famous portrait of his wife in a blue hat by Matisse from 1905, Matisse's portraits of Leo and Sarah Stein and the sculpture \\"La Négresse Blanche\\" by Brâncuși. Rochat also catalogued the fine art in the estate of composer Edgard Varèse and Louise Varèse. Rochat discovered works by such artists as Giorgio de Chirico, Yves Tanguy, Pierre Soulages and Amedeo Modigliani, hidden theretofore in Western collections. In 2005/6 he became Fine Arts consultant at DoyleNewYork, where again he made discoveries such as a rare drawing by Egon Schiele, now in the Neue Galerie museum in New York and an important small panel by Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida, circa 1900 of the beach at San Sébastian, with the image of his wife in the foreground. Private career in the Fine Arts Gui Rochat has made some remarkable discoveries of disappeared and unrecognized Old Master paintings and drawings, i.e. European paintings created before circa 1800 during his activities as a private Old Master painting and drawing dealer. Examples of these are two canvases by the French/Italian master Michele DeSubleay (or Michele Desubleo) *, both now illustrated in color in the catalogue raisonné of his work, one of which was already recorded as lost, mentioned in his testament (cf Thieme Becker and Milantoni). And an important large oil on paper study for an unknown altar painting of the Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew by Antoine Rivalz :fr:Antoine Rivalz *, acquired by the Musée des Augustins in Toulouse, France, also fully illustrated and described in the catalogue raisonné on the artist. Rochat found a superb pair of red chalk drawings by François Boucher, after a painting by Francesco Solimena, that formed part of the collection of Cardinal Fesch, the uncle of Napoleon, now housed in the cardinal's museum palace in Ajaccio, Corsica *. They proved a fact which was not known till then that Boucher on his voyage to Italy had stopped in Venice probably around 1730, where the Solimena work was then still hanging in the Baglioni collection. These drawings are now both in Ajaccio. The National Gallery of Scotland * acquired a rediscovered strong oil sketch of a young woman in profile by the Flemish artist François-Joseph Navez, a pupil of Jacques-Louis David, and a significant and beautiful oil sketch of Achilles presenting the body of Hector to the deceased Patroclus by the French/Flemish artist Joseph-Benoît Suvée * , a later and changed version of his work in the Louvre is now in a European private collection and will be included in the forthcoming catalogue raisonne by Drs. Join-Lambert and Leclair. The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts * bought in 2008 a significant small oil on copper of the Virgin and Christ by the forerunner of Canadian art, the French monk Frère Luc, who entered a Quebec monastery in the late 17th century. A more recent discovery is that of a drawing preparatory for an engraving by Claudine Bouzonnet-Stella *, the niece of the more famous French artist Jacques Stella, who was a close friend of Nicolas Poussin when both worked in Italy. Stella had bought a beautiful painting by Poussin of Venus giving arms to Aeneas, which is now in the museum in Rouen and on his death it was inherited by Bouzonnet Stella, who was an excellent engraver. This drawing was done by her from the painting and squared for transfer, i.e. for being engraved. Aside from his interest in French Old Masters, Gui Rochat discovered in New York for a collector a very large and important work by the Dutch master Abraham Bloemaert fully signed and dated 1624, which was offered by Sotheby's New York in a very dirty condition as attributed to Bloemaert's son, a much lesser painter. The signature and date appeared after cleaning of the painting. In the Braith-Mali Museum at Biberach * in Germany is now a rediscovered small copper by the German master Johann Heinrich Schönfeld * of Alexander offering Campaspe to Apelles. And the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam acquired a very charming drawing in red chalk of a young woman looking at an engraving, recognized as by the 18th-century Dutch artist Gijsbertus van der Berg. Also among the most recent discoveries is a small but very fine oil on copper by the baroque French artist Jacques de Létin * of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, which is now in the Musee des Beaux- Arts in Troyes, France, and a very rare discovery of \\"The Calling of Saint James the Greater\\" by Claude-Guy Hallé (catalogue raisonné on the artist by Nicole Willk-Brocard, 1995, p. 286, number C 42 listed as lost). Recently was sold to a Paris collection a very fine 'Allegory of Venus with Eros and Anteros' by Charles Poerson (French, 1609-1667) *, a painting that remained for a long time without a correct attribution though it was sold in a Sotheby Monaco sale in 1994 and stayed till recently in a major Italian collection as by an unknown but major French seventeenth century painter. It was on loan to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2013. Gui Rochat is mentioned in the literature and on the internet (see references and notes).

Phillips) and stock broker Kenny (Jefferson Brown), are the popular guys who get all the girls. One night Dagen meets Samantha (Jordan Madley), who he begins to pursue, but as she rejects him time and time again, he begins to actually fall in love with her though she is the daughter of the dangerous and powerful mob boss Ventura Ritt (Carlo Rota). Despite the declining housing market as reported by trusted news anchor Veronica Wolf (Vivica Fox), Dagen is able to sell a million dollar home to none other than Ventura Ritt, who is purchasing it for his daughter, whom Dagen admires. Meanwhile, after losing his job as a day-trader, his best friend Kenny, an amazing poker player, is in need of a new opportunity to make some cash. The two friends scheme a way to get Ventura Ritt to play in a poker game to earn their trust. Their plans succeed, and making some risky bets with help of his old secretary, Jen (Sam Gutstadt), Kenny starts to make Ventura a lot of money – so Ventura then trusts him with a million dollars. However, Kennyʼs luck changes, and in an attempt to make Ventura even more money, he loses every penny. After much work Dagen convinces Samantha that he is not the club scumbag she thinks he is, and they begin successfully dating until a girl from Dagenʼs past shows up unexpectedly and kisses him as Samantha sees, confirming her past fears about him.

Soon after its launch, it became one of the most vocal critics of Paul Biya's regime. The station was notorious for showing live footage of political demonstration against constitutional change in Cameroon which favoured president Biya's stay in power after 2011 when he is constitutionally barred from running for office again. The station was suspended from broadcast in January 2008 provoking widespread protest in Douala where it is based. It is even believed that it suspension was one of the remote causes of the February general strike in Cameroon against rising food prices, the cost of fuel and constitutional amendment which left over one hundred people dead (40 in official estimates) and state and private property worth millions of dollars damaged. the station has a myriad of interesting political programmes one of which is the popular 'Droit De Reponse' aired every Sunday from 12:00 currently moderated by journalist Sandrine Yamga.

The commission is part of the Judicial Branch of the state government and reports directly to the state Supreme Court. Duties The commission is responsible for creating a list of three candidates to fill vacant positions on the state judiciary. The commission follows a set of guidelines in the state constitution to determine eligibility for the positions, and to ensure that they only nominate the best qualified candidates that are available. The Governor then chooses a candidate from the list to fill the vacant position. The commission has the authority to choose who, among the sitting supreme court associate justices, will serve as Chief Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court, and, whenever a lower state court has requested that a senior judge be appointed to it, to certify to the Supreme Court whether a person seeking appointment as the senior judge has met the requirements for appointment, as established by the Supreme Court. The commission is also responsible for determining the qualifications of candidates who apply for state judgeship. The commission is responsible for addressing complaints about the courts and investigating problems within the courts. The commission also audits the judges to ensure compliance with the Code of Judicial Conduct. Although the commission has no power to enforce its decisions, it does submit reports to the Supreme Court, which decides what portion of the commission's recommendations to follow. The commission is a constitutional body established by article seven of the Constitution of Indiana. In addition to its constitutional authority, the Indiana General Assembly has granted the commission additional statutory authority in the Indiana Code. Members The commission has a total of seven members and is chaired by the Chief Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court, unless the Chief Justice chooses a different justice to chair the commission instead. Three of the other members, who may not be lawyers, are citizens of Indiana appointed by the governor. The remaining three members must be among, and are elected by, those admitted to the practice of law in Indiana. The Commission was established in 1970 by a constitutional amendment to replace the previous system of electing judges and justices. History Under the original 1816 constitution of Indiana, judges were appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Indiana Senate, and would serve terms of six years. The system came to be criticized when Governor James B. Ray refused to reappoint two members of the Supreme Court for political reasons.Woollen, pp. 57 & 60 A similar situation occurred during the term of Governor James Whitcomb when he also refused to reappoint two members because he thought they were too slow to resolve cases.Woollen, p. 83 In 1851, Indiana adopted a new constitution and the positions on the courts were made publicly elected offices, but that method too quickly came under criticism as the position became even more politicized. The courts remained publicly elected until a series of amendments were passed in 1970 and 1971 that reorganized the state courts and established the Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission to replace the method of publicly electing judges. The new system was intended to make to judicial branch of the government more independent by giving it measure of control over selecting its own members, but limiting their power by making their choice subject, in part, to the approval of the governor.

Partly autobiographical,According to Roche, her book is 70 per cent autobiographical. See \\"Charlotte Roche im Hallenbad\\", Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung it was first published in German in 2008 by M. DuMont Schauberg and was the world's best-selling novel in March 2008.\\"Fiction in German Makes It to Pole Position\\", The Economist (April 3, 2008) For supporters it is a piece of erotic literature; for critics it is cleverly marketed pornography.Jason Burke: \\"Publishers Battle to Sign Up Europe's Sex Sensation\\", The Observer, (May 25, 2008). It was published in English as Wetlands by Grove Press in April 2009. The title, which might be translated as \\"wetlands\\" or \\"damp areas,\\" here refers to a woman's genitals. Plot Set in an anonymous German city, Wetlands is told by 18-year-old Helen Memel, a schoolgirl who spends some days in the proctological ward of a hospital to be treated for an anal fissure caused by the careless shaving of her anal hair. Deep at heart Helen is lonely and bored, and has been so since the breakup of her parents' marriage. Her secret plan is to reunite her father and mother by having them visit her at the same time. However, her parents seem to have little interest in their daughter's well-being and show up only occasionally, only for short periods of time, and at different hours. When she learns that her surgery, which included the removal of haemorrhoids, has been successful and she is going to be released soon, she desperately looks for means to prolong her hospital stay. She secretly rams the pedal of her hospital bed into her anus and immediate emergency surgery has to be carried out to prevent extreme blood loss. Thus having successfully extended her stay, she waits in vain for her miracle to happen: her parents have stopped visiting altogether, and when she tries to contact them by phone all she gets is their respective answering machines. During this time she falls in love with her favourite male nurse called Robin and tries to draw the young man into her world. At the end of the novel the doctor tells Helen she can go home and she asks Robin if she can go live with him. It becomes apparent that Helen is traumatized, following a childhood experience when her mother tried to commit suicide, although her narration may be unreliable. As the novel ends, Robin is escorting her through a door in the hospital. Major themes The major part of Wetlands is made up of Helen's thoughts, reminiscences and sexual fantasies while confined to her hospital bed. A sexually active woman since she was fifteen, she has had sex with many men and boys and describes herself as continuously randy. Shortly after her 18th birthday she had herself sterilised without telling her parents about it. Helen has an unusual relationship to her body. She abhors personal hygiene and enjoys many of the bodily fluids which are secreted or excreted from it, be it mucus, pus, earwax, smegma, blood (including menstrual blood), sweat, or tears, but also men's sperm, all of which she \\"recycles\\" by putting them into her mouth and swallowing them. She loves to attract potential sexual partners by parading, underneath her dress, her unwashed vulva and the smells emanating from it. In a series of interviews Roche explained that cleanliness and above all pedantic care for their own bodies, including the use of artificial scents such as perfume, have been inculcated upon women for ages; that this obstructs their—not just sexual—self-realisation; and that the fear of harmful \\"bacteria\\" has been vastly exaggerated.Jenni Zylka: \\"Schleimporno gegen Hygienezwang\\", taz (February 28, 2008).\\"Ich bin gar nicht so frech\\", Der Spiegel No.9 (February 25, 2008).\\"Der ungezähmte Körper\\", umagazine.de. Generally, Wetlands touches upon a number of taboo topics not only in the sexual arena but also those that can be found in the society at large, particularly in dysfunctional families. These include self-mutilation, amnesia triggered by recreational drug abuse, people's inability to deal with suicide attempts, and incest.

The design of the not too heavy camera was derived from the Voigtländer viewfinder cameras, with rounded sides and a shifter on the front side as shutter release. Its designer was Walter Swarofsky. A specialty of the camera was that shutter speed and aperture were controlled by rings around the bayonet. The lenses had only a distance control ring. The bayonet is a variant of the Deckel bayonet (DKL) offering mechanical control of both, aperture release and automatic aperture setting. The Septon 1:2/50mm was a well regarded lens, and like the Skopagon 2.0/40mm it was a quite fast lens for that type of SLR. The exposure delay was only 1/50 sec.

However, with the help of a group of Australian, New Zealand and Welsh expats, along with local Indonesians, Malaysians and Singaporeans, the game was revived in 2004. Although traditionally seen as the province of Commonwealth expatriates, the game has made strides amongst the native population.Bath, Richard (ed.) The Complete Book of Rugby (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 ) p68 As with many other minor rugby nations, the sport is mainly played in and around the capital Jakarta. It is often staged by various multisport clubs. Among the more prominent Jakarta-based clubs are the Jakarta Komodos Rugby Club and the Jakarta Banteng Rugby Club. Today there is an Indonesia national rugby union team and a somewhat successful sevens team, and the game is somewhat more developed, but remains minor. There is also an ongoing schools programme.

His story is related in the anonymous 6th-century Georgian hagiographic novel The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta. One of the earliest extant works of the Georgian literature, The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta (მარტჳლობაჲ და მოთმინებაჲ წმიდისა ევსტათი მცხეთელისაჲ) was written by an anonymous author later in the 6th century, within thirty years of Eustathius' reported death. The morphology of the work as well as some theological phrases also supports this dating, although the earliest surviving manuscript dates from c. 1000 (Georgian National Center of Manuscripts, MSS H-341). The text is also interesting for the first Georgian formulation of the Ten Commandments, an account of the life of Jesus which recalls Tatian's Diatessaron (a Gospel harmony of the 2nd century), and traces of influence of the 2nd century Apology of Aristides. The Passion was first published by Mikhail Sabinin in 1882.Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History, pp. 44-45. Routledge, . Eustathius is reported by the hagiographer to have been an Iranian cobbler originally called Gvirobandak, son of a high-ranking Zoroastrian priest (magi), from Ganzak. Having converted to Christianity, he flees persecution to Georgia (Iberia), then under the Iranian military authority, in 541. He settles at the Christian town of Mtskheta and marries a Christian woman. The local Iranian cobblers’ guild denounces Eustathius to the marzban Arvand Gushnasp with seven other converts to be judged. Arvand punishes the apostates by having their noses pierced and casts them in prison under sentence of death. Six months later, Arvand releases them, however, as a farewell gesture to the local people, when recalled from Georgia by the king Khosrau I. Four years later, under the new marzban Vezhan Buzmihr, Eustathius is rearrested, but reaffirms his faith before the court in a speech of some 3,000 words that makes up nearly half the Passion. Eventually, the marzban, albeit reluctant, has him beheaded in Tbilisi. The remains of Eustathius were taken to Mtskheta and buried at its principal church.Lang, David Marshall (1976), Lives and Legends of the Georgian Saints, pp. 95-99. Mowbrays: London and New York.

Death of Clement XIV Clement XIV suppressed the Society of Jesus Pope Clement XIV died suddenly on September 22, 1774 at the age of 68. His pontificate had been dominated by the problem of the Society of Jesus. The various courts under the House of Bourbon and the Kingdom of Portugal (under the House of Braganza) urged the general suppression of the order. The pope tried to defend Jesuits and to temporize, but finally had to capitulate, and in 1773 he issued the Brief Dominus ac Redemptor which suppressed the Society of Jesus. Father Lorenzo Ricci, general of the order, had been imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo. However, the Jesuits still had many adherents in the Roman Curia and in the Sacred College of Cardinals. The attitude toward Jesuits remained the main criterion of the appreciation of the candidates to the papal succession in the subsequent conclave.The Triple Crown The death of a pope frequently presented an opportunity for the citizens of Rome to vent their anti-clerical feelings, often in the context of satires, sometimes salacious, directed at either the late pope or the cardinals. In 1774, the Governor of Rome had occasion to ban a drama entitled the Conclave for offending the \\"dignity, decorum, and venerable representation of the Sacred College, as well as, other persons as subjects.\\" List of participants At the death of Clement XIV there were fifty-five cardinals in the Sacred College, but two of them died during sede vacante, while another nine remained entirely absent.

Cecilia; prefect of the S.C. of the Tridentine Council (died on February 4, 1775 at Rome) Divisions in the Sacred College The College of Cardinals was generally divided into two blocs: curial, pro-Jesuit (zelanti) and political, anti-Jesuit. The first one was formed by the Italian curial cardinals who opposed the secular influences on the Church. The second one included crown-cardinals of the Catholic courts. These two blocs were in no way homogenous. Zelanti were divided into moderate and radical factions. The anti-Jesuit bloc was divided into several national groups with different interests. The leader of Zelanti was Cardinal Marcantonio Colonna. The other representatives of this faction were Giovanni Battista Rezzonico, his relative Carlo Rezzonico, who occupied the important office of the camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, Gian Francesco Albani, dean of the College of Cardinals, and Alessandro Albani, archdeacon of the College. The Rezzonichi represented the radical wing of this faction, while the Albanis and Colonna represented the moderate wing. Among the anti-Jesuit cardinals the main leader was Cardinal de Bernis, ambassador of Louis XVI of France. The interests of Charles III of Spain were represented by Cardona, interests of Ferdinand III of Sicily/Ferdinand IV of Naples by Orsini, while those of Maria Theresa of Austria and her son Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor were under the care of Migazzi and Corsini. Also very influential was Cardinal Giraud, former nuncio in France. Several cardinals were not counted among the members of these factions.Bourgoing, p. 5-7 There was no main favourite of the conclave. About thirty cardinals were considered papabile. Conclave The conclave began on October 5, 1774. Initially there were only 28 participants. By the middle of December their number reached only 39, but by the end of the conclave five more cardinals arrived.Damian Hungs: Pius VI Cardinal Marcantonio Colonna, taking advantage of the small number of electors, mostly curial cardinals belonging to his zelanti faction, tried to release Father Ricci from prison. This initiative obtained support of camerlengo Carlo Rezzonico and of Cardinal of York, but the anti-Jesuit faction was strong enough to frustrate it. Every day at least one ballot took place, but no candidates with serious chances for the election were proposed at the beginning, because the number of electors was relatively small and they were obliged to await the arrival of the rest, particularly of those representatives of the courts who did not reside in Rome. Zelanti voted mainly for their leader Colonna, who received the greatest number of votes in these initial ballots, but certainly had no chances to secure the required majority of two thirds.Bourgoing, p. 14-15 Some other candidates were also put forward by the Zelanti, but they were all rejected by crown-cardinals as too pro- Jesuit. Against the candidature of Giovanni Carlo Boschi the Bourbon courts even pronounced the official papal veto.Pattenden, Miles. Electing the Pope in Early Modern Italy, 1450-1700, Oxford University Press, 2017, Although the court factions cooperated by blocking of Zelanti candidates, they were unable to agree upon one of their own. Spain supported Pallavicino, while Austria favoured Visconti, a former nuncio at Vienna. Towards the end of 1774, the name of young Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Braschi was raised for the first time. Braschi belonged to the moderate wing of the Zelanti faction. He was advanced by Cardinal Giraud, and obtained a significant number of votes. The crown- cardinals rejected Braschi as pro-Jesuit,Ott, Michael. \\"Pope Pius VI.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 30 May 2018 although Cardinal de Bernis in his report for the French court found him moderate man and did not exclude the support for him in the future, if no better candidate would be found. No consensus had been achieved before the end of 1774.Bourgoing, p. 17-18 In January 1775 cardinals Migazzi, Borromeo, Caracciolo, Pallavicino and Visconti were proposed by the political factions, but without any significant success, because Zelanti rejected all candidates recommended by the monarchs.Bourgoing, p. 19 Cardinal Zelada tried to mediate between factions, proposing to reduce the number of candidates to six, of whom each of the two blocs had to advance three, and to elect the one who would be the most acceptable for all. But this initiative had also failed.Bourgoing, p. 20; Damian Hungs: Pius VI thumb Gradually French Cardinals de Bernis and Luynes came to the conclusion that it was impossible to find any better candidate with chances for election than the initially rejected Cardinal Braschi. This was the turning point of the conclave. Braschi's candidacy gained important and influential allies. But Spain and Portugal still opposed him as too favorable toward the Jesuits. Braschi also had some opponents in the radical wing of his own party. To secure the required majority, Cardinal de Bernis aligned himself with Cardinal Zelada, who acted as mediator: de Bernis had to convince the political factions, while Zelada had to overcome the opposition among the radical Zelanti.Bourgoing, p. 23 Also Cardinal Albani was engaged in the promotion of Braschi. Cardinal Zelada secured the support of Zelanti without serious problems. Spain's candidate, Pallavicino, openly declared that he would not accept the tiara and supported Braschi.Bourgoing, p. 22 The other political factions agreed when Braschi promised the ratification of the suppression of the Jesuits, his friendship to the House of Bourbon and to the House of Habsburg, and agreed to be guided by the allies in the distribution of State offices. Election of Pius VI On February 15, 1775, after 134 days of deliberation, on the 265th ballot,K. Dopierała, p. 370 Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Braschi was elected to the papacy receiving all votes except his own, which, according to custom, he gave to Gian Francesco Albani, dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals. He took the name of Pius VI, in honour of St. Pius V. On February 22, 1775 the Pope-elect was consecrated bishop of Rome by Cardinal Dean Gian Francesco Albani, bishop of Porto e Santa Rufina, assisted by Sub-dean Henry Benedict Stuart, bishop of Frascati, and Camerlengo Carlo Rezzonico, bishop of Sabina. On the same day he was also solemnly crowned by Cardinal Alessandro Albani, protodeacon of S. Maria in Via Lata.S.

The school opened in 1967History page, Sandringham High School. and teaches grades 8 to 12. Sandringham opened as a White co-educational English-speaking school teaching under the Transvaal Education Department (TED) of the South African government, meaning that the language of instruction was English and only Whites (as classified under Apartheid-era legislation) attended the school before 1991. Education style The school is situated in middle-to-upper-class Johannesburg suburbia, and during the Apartheid years it reflected a traditional British style of education, with school uniforms and corporal punishment. Although progressive compared to other similar schools in South Africa (teaching modern film, carpentry, and culinary skills in addition to basic academic subjects), it was conservative and disciplined by western standards. Like similar schools, Sandringham had many extramural facilities, including tennis courts, a 25-meter swimming pool, rugby and cricket fields, computer training facilities, theatrical stage lighting in the main hall, modern audio-visual equipment, and a pupil-teacher ratio of about 30 to 1. Although Sandringham is not a boarding school, pupils are allocated to one of four \\"Houses\\", and made to compete against each other in a number of activities. Sports participation was strongly encouraged and the emphasis on sporting achievement was reflected in a large number of award ceremonies and prizes available to sporting participants. Corporal punishment As in many South African schools, discipline was enforced by corporal punishment. South Africa had inherited this British-style system during the pre-1948 colonial era.School corporal punishment in South Africa at World Corporal Punishment Research. Corporal punishment was however only inflicted upon male students, officially with a cane specially designed for the purpose, but sometimes unofficially with a cricket bat, hockey stick, blackboard compass, beach bat, or other suitable implement as may be available, or may suit the style and preference of the teacher. Offenses punished by official caning included talking in class, littering, hair longer than 5 cm in length, fighting, and failure to attend rugby practice. The punishment was administered to the seat of the offending boy's trousers. Initiation ceremony Sandringham never adopted the time- honored tradition of initiation typical of the South African school system. There was, however, widespread bullying characterised by physical and verbal abuse that is common to school environments across the globe. Initiation was banned by the South African Schools Act in 1996.\\"South African Schools Act of 1996\\" Post-apartheid During the early 1990s, political reforms allowed small numbers of non-white students to attend school. Because admission criteria included geographical proximity, the number of black students was initially small, but increased with time. Corporal punishment in schools was made illegal by legislation in 1997.\\"Assembly passes new schools bill\\", Cape Times, 30 October 1996.

Development Design on the aircraft began in 1930, to follow up from the other Dornier bomber prototype, the Dornier Do P. The first aircraft flew in March 1930. It was a shoulder-wing monoplane of all-metal construction with fixed tailwheel landing gear, similar to the Do P, however this model had three engines instead of four. A civil transport version was proposed as the Dornier Do U, but this was never produced. Operational history The Do P and Do Y were displayed in the early 1930s as freighter prototypes; they were in fact evolutionary steps towards creating the Luftwaffe's first operational bomber, the Dornier Do 11a. Two examples were produced for the Royal Yugoslav Air Force in 1931, followed by two more machines six years later. All four served with the 81st regiment at Mostar- Ortijes until replaced by the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 in 1939. The aircraft were then relegated to transport and liaison roles until all four were captured by German forces at Kraljevo in 1941. One of them was subsequently handed over to the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia. Fast passenger aircraft Do 15 In 1932, Dornier worked on two aircraft with the Wnr. 243 and 244. They were originally ordered by Yugoslavia, but then cancelled. These aircraft were part of the Do K and Do Y projects. There was a request for tender by Deutsche Luft Hansa and the Reich Air Ministry for a fast passenger aircraft - which in fact was to get a fast bomber. Dornier offered the design with the new naming Dornier Do 15. The same request lead to the superior designs, Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 86. This caused Dornier to develop a new design, the Dornier Do 17.

Its last assignment was with the 443d Airlift Wing, being inactivated at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma on 1 October 1992. History : For related history and lineage, see 443d Airlift Wing Formed during World War II, the 443d Troop Carrier Group deployed to the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations in 1944 and using C-47s and sometimes gliders to transport Allied troops, evacuate wounded personnel, and haul supplies and materiel, including gasoline, oil, signal and engineering equipment, medicine, rations, and ammunition. The group's missions were concerned primarily with support for Allied forces that were driving southward through Burma, but the 443d also made flights to China. It moved to China in August 1945 and received a Distinguished Unit Citation for transporting men from Chihkiang to Nanking in September 1945. World War II The 443d Troop Carrier Group was established on 25 May 1943 and activated on 1 October as a Troop Carrier unit, being equipped with the C-47/C-53 Skytrain at Sedalia AAF, Missouri. Once training was completed the group transferred to Tenth Air Force in India, in February 1944 in the China Burma India Theater. When the 443d arrived in India Combat Cargo Groups were being organized, and the group's personnel and aircraft were assigned to the 1st Combat Cargo Group. New squadrons were assigned, and, the group used C-47s and sometimes gliders to transport Allied troops, evacuate wounded personnel, and haul supplies and materiel, including gasoline, oil, signal and engineering equipment, medicine, rations, and ammunition. Douglas C-47 Skytrain in flight, 1940s The group's missions were concerned primarily with support for Allied forces that were driving southward through Burma but the 443rd also made many flights to China. When General Joseph Stilwell was ready to begin the retaking of Burma, his forces were to fight across the northern Burmese mountains to the village of Naga. From there they would head down the Hukawng Valley toward the Japanese stronghold at Mogaung, then they would head to Myitkyina. At the same time Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, would attack Burma from China's western mountainous border. British General Orde Wingate and his \\"Chindits\\" were ready to begin their push into Burma with a goal of establishing permanent areas of occupation behind Japanese lines. British General William Slim was to bring his troops from Arakan, India into Burma. The final objective of this three-pronged attack was the town Myitkyina. All these operations were to be largely supplied by air-support provided by the 443d and the 177th wing of the Royal Air Force. The unit was reassigned to Fourteenth Air Force in January and moved to China in August 1945, and received a Distinguished Unit Citation for transporting a Chinese army of more than 30,000 men from Chihkiang to Nanking in September 1945. Returned to the United States in December, and, inactivated on 26 December 1945 at Camp Anza, California. Cold War Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar in flight, 1952 The 443d trained as a Reserve troop-carrier unit under the supervision of the 2596th Air Force Reserve Training Center from June 1949 to April 1951. The 443d was brought to active duty at Donaldson Air Force Base, South Carolina on 9 August 1951 as a training wing by Tactical Air Command. For almost two years, the 443d participated in tactical exercises in operations, training troop-carrier aircrews using C-46 Commandos for assignment to the Far East and worked closely with other troop-carrier groups to test and evaluate new troop- carrier doctrine and procedures. With the nearing end of the Korean War, the 443d was inactivated on 1 February 1953. As part of the Air Force's Objective Wing reorganization, the 443d was redesignated the 443d Operations Group and activated on 1 October 1991, being assigned the operational squadrons of the 443d Airlift Wing. A year later, it was inactivated and its mission, personnel and equipment were reassigned to the 97th Operations Group.

Her early sprint robbed her of speed for the rest of the run and she was overtaken with some jostling and she lagged out of contention.

Family George Philip was born in Huntly, Aberdeenshire, to a staunchly Calvinist family. In 1819 George traveled to Liverpool where his brother Robert, who was a nonconformist minister, lived. Here George made his home and in 1819 George became assistant to the Liverpool bookseller, William Grapel. In 1834, Philip set up his own business as a bookseller and stationer in Paradise Street, Liverpool. He rapidly expanded the business by producing books, particularly educational works and maps.Graces Guide To British Industrial Britain: George Philip & Son Ltd.: https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/George_Philip_and_Son Within his first year of trading to keep up with demand he had to move his business into larger premises at the Atlas Buildings in South Castle Street. George and his wife Jane had a daughter Jane Jr. (born 1827) and one son, George Jr. (1823–1902). In 1848, George Jr. was admitted as a partner into the family publishing business now called George Philip & Son Ltd. George Philip & Son Ltd. During the early 1840s George Philip opened and ran a bookseller's and stationer's shop in South Castle Street, Liverpool, and it was during this period he laid the foundations for building and expanding his publishing empire from which he would eventually amass a substantial fortune.The Porcupine, Liverpool, 21 October 1882 - The Death of Mr. George Philip (report) (retrieved 19 January 2018): Liverpool Central Library, Liverpool Worthies, cabinet 6, EQ330, Volume 3, page 24 (microfilm) His son George Jr. (1823-1902), along with his nephew Thomas Dash Philip (1829-1913), and Philip's daughter Jane Jr. (who served behind the counter), assisted him in the shop at South Castle Street. Both George Jr. and Thomas would, in time, head the family-run business.

In 1859, the company took over the extensive pile known as Caxton Buildings in South John Street, Liverpool, which became the company's headquarters in the city. With the establishment of their printing works in Caxton Buildings, new power-driven machinery gave the company the capacity to increase production.Liverpool Daily Post, Wednesday 22 May 1963, page V (supplement)- How George Philip Made the World His Parish (article by Ian Stocks) Caxton Buildings, Liverpool, 1859. The printing works of George Philip & Son Ltd. were situated here. Philip used cartographers such as John Bartholomew the elder, August Petermann, and William Hughes to produce maps on copper plates. Philip then had these printed and hand-coloured by his women tinters. By the time he produced his county maps of 1862 he was using machine coloured maps produced on power-driven lithographic presses. 'His maps ranged from the expensive Imperial Library Atlas (1864) to an atlas costing as little as 3d. and, although the bulk of his production was for the commercial, and particularly the educational market, he also produced important scientific maps, notably of North America, especially the Arctic and Pacific Northwest, and of the West Indies. The firm supplied atlases, geographical and history books, school textbooks, and an array of educational books and equipment. The company also produced textbooks for overseas countries, starting with an atlas for Australian schools in 1865 and for New Zealand in 1869. The demand from board schools, established after 1870, enabled further expansion in the market for general textbooks, school stationery, atlases and wall maps, etc Philip also employed many noted writers including the geographer and historian John Francon Williams who wrote, compiled and edited many books for the company from 1881 over a 20-year period. George Philip & Son logo used in many books published by the company In 1867, a descriptive account of Philip Son & Nephew, based at Atlas and Victoria Buildings, 45-51 South Castle Street, Liverpool, was written up in the book Liverpool of Today, The Maritime Metropolis of the World, published by Historical Publishing Company. ‘This well-known emporium may be aptly designated the great Liverpool depot for all the aids to learning, mental instruction, and useful knowledge. It would be superfluous for us to say anything in praise of an establishment, which has been universally recognized as the leading house of its class in the provinces. In addition to the extensive premises in South Castle Street the firm have a wholesale warehouse, occupying the whole of Caxton Buildings in South John Street, which is carried on under the style of George Philip and Son, paper manufacturers, wholesale, export, and manufacturing stationers. This is a noble pile of buildings, five stories in height. An idea of the extent of the business done here may be gathered from the fact that over 300 hands are employed on the premises. The firm manufacture account books of every description and undertake to make them to order. Their general stock is very large and in great variety. Philip Son and Nephew have classified their business under nine distinct heads': * 1: Popular and Standard Books department, including one of the largest collections of prize books in the kingdom. * 2: Educational department, including school books, stationery, maps, diagrams, needlework materials, gymnastic apparatus, and school furniture. * 3: Kindergarten department, comprising all the latest and most improved articles for varied occupations, etc., also a variety of games, puzzles, picture blocks etc. * 4: Stationery department, comprising all kinds of commercial and family stationery. * 5: Artists’ department, containing every requisite for drawing and painting, and a large selection of studies for school use. * 6: Sunday-school department, including bibles, common prayer books, hymn books and church services. * 7: Fancy Goods department, including albums, desks, work-boxes etc. suitable for school prizes or for presentation. * 8: Photographic department, comprising upwards of 21,000 unmounted photographs. * 9: Nautical and Engineering department, including Admiralty charts, engineering, scientific, and nautical books.

The premises occupied by the firm in South Castle Street (on the site of Old Pool Lane) are of very considerable size, having been enlarged from time to time during the last twenty years, by taking in adjoining properties, so that now they cover a wide area. They are of attractive appearance externally, and internally they are very handsome, being fitted up in superior style throughout, and arranged with every regard for the comfort and convenience of visitors. The firm have opened a showroom on the ground floor of the premises for the sale of school books and school stationery, and another portion of the building is devoted to school furniture of every description, maps, diagrams, and wall prints, and the other sections of the establishment are judiciously sub-divided, so that there is a separate department for each class of goods. A large and intelligent staff of assistants (about forty in number) are employed. The firm have issued a series of tourist and travelling maps, and maps and road books for cyclists, and they keep in stock guide books to all parts of the world. The business in South Castle Street was established in 1835, and its growth has kept pace with the increase and prosperity of Liverpool.

At that point, the Apostolic Union, the Priests' Eucharistic League, and the Priests' Communion League, had become established widely in many countries. There were also such confraternities operating nationally. Description A confraternity is a society of persons associated for some pious object. The members are linked together by a bond of brotherhood for mutual co-operation in the pursuit of a specific object of religion or charity by means of prayer, example, and counsel. A confraternity of priests in the strict sense of the word seeks before all else the personal sanctification of its members. Sacerdotal confraternities have as their common object being to preserve priests from the dangers of spiritual and social isolation, and to afford them something of that mutual support which belongs to a religious community. The particular aims of priests' confraternities may be reduced to three: personal holiness, ecclesiastical learning, and mutual financial aid. Financial assistance embraces cases of sickness and old age, as well as loans, medical attendance, and legal advice. * The Confraternity of Catholic Clergy was founded in 1975. It is an association of Catholic Priests and Deacons in the United States who are pledged to the pursuit of personal holiness, loyalty to the Roman Pontiff, commitment to theological study and strict adherence to the authentic teachings of the Magisterium.Donovan, Colin B., \\"Confraternity of Catholic Clergy\\" * The Australian Confraternity of Catholic Clergy was founded in 1987. * The Irish Confraternity of Catholic Clergy was established in 2013.Irish Confraternity of Catholic Clergy References Category:Confraternities ","title":"Confraternity of priests"},{"id":"18716325","text":"An acceptable loss, also known as acceptable damage, is a military euphemism used to indicate casualties or destruction inflicted by the enemy that is considered minor or tolerable. In combat situations, leaders have to often choose between options where no one solution is perfect and all choices will lead to casualties or other costs to their own troops. A small scale practical example might be when the advancement of troops is halted by a minefield. In many military operations, the speed of advancement is more important than the safety of troops. Thus, the minefield must be \\"breached\\" even if this means some casualties. On a larger strategic level, there is a limit to how many casualties a nation's military or the public are willing to withstand when they go to war. For example, there is an ongoing debate on how the conceptions of acceptable losses affect how the United States conducts its military operations. The concept of acceptable losses has also been adopted to business use, meaning taking necessary risks and the general costs of doing business, also covered with terms such as waste or shrinkage. The euphemism is related to the concept of acceptable risk, which is used in many areas such as medicine and politics, to describe a situation where a course of action is taken because the expected benefits outweigh the potential hazards.

It is the largest native North American species of Dryopteris and along with ostrich fern it is one of the largest ferns in eastern North America. Specimens are known with fronds six feet (1.8 meters) tall. D. goldieana hybridizes with many other species of Dryopteris and the hybrids tend to be larger than the pure species. It was named by William Hooker in honor of its discoverer, John Goldie. The epithet was originally published as goldiana, but this is regarded as a misspelling to be corrected. Description Goldie's fern is common in moist rich woods, ravines, seeps, or at the edges of swamps and in areas with full or partial shade. It grows in a clumped form where all the leave emerge from the same point on the ground. The stipe, the division of stem which emerges from the roots and holds no leaflets, is very densely covered in dark brown to black scales (which may have a tan border) toward the base and decreases in scale density as it approaches the area containing the leaflets. The stipe itself is 1/3 the length of the total leaf, flat or slightly channeled on the upper side and dark brown to nearly black at the base and fades to green distally. The axis, or portion of the stem which actually supports the leaflets is green and also covered in pale scales. The leaf itself rather thick in texture but not evergreen. It may range from dark green to golden green color. The leaves may be 35–120 cm in length and 15–40 cm in width depending on the specimen. The base of the leaf is not strongly tapering and the bottom leaflets are only slightly smaller than the leaflets directly above them. The tip of the leaf is rather short or abruptly tapering which is a distinctive characteristic to help distinguish this fern from similar species. The tip of the leaf may also be white mottled in some specimens. The leaf is broken up into many pairs of leaflets which are mostly pinnate but some at the bottom of the leaf may be bipinnately divided. The leaflets are typically tapering at both the base and the tip and have a short stem connecting them to the main stem. The leaflets are themselves divided into many subleaflets which are oblong or elliptic in shape with a pointed tip and a toothed edge. They are generally curved such that the tip of the leaflets points toward the tip of the leaflet. Dryopteris goldieana showing unripe sori The shapes of fertile (bearing spores and sori) and sterile (lacking spores) leaflets are identical. The sori are typically placed near the midvein and are covered in a smooth, kidney shaped indusium. Each fertile leaflet contains 6–8 pairs of sori which are paired across the midvein. In midsummer the spores turn brown and ripen and are released into the wind. It is one of the parents of the polyploid hybrids Dryopteris celsa and Dryopteris clintoniana. Cultivation Goldie's fern requires medium sunlight or shade and high humidity conditions to thrive along with moist soil with an abundance of organic matter. It also requires protection from wind.

However Loingsech did not succeed to this title and neither did Murchad and they were only called king of the Cenél Conaill at their death notices in the annals. During Murchad's reign the rival Cenél nEógain had acquired the kingship in the person of Niall Frossach (died 778) in 763.

The structure has been used as a ropewalk, a dormitory for women at Georgetown Female Seminary, and a residential dwelling. During the past 180 years, Georgetown College has bought and sold the property three times. The property was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on April 2, 1973. History In 1784, Elijah Craig established the town of Lebanon, Virginia in an area of Kentucky now known as Scott County. As a tribute to the first President of the United States, George Washington, the name was changed to George Town in 1790, and later shortened to Georgetown. The town was centered around Royal Spring, a large spring that was a reliable source of water for the residents and industry in the area. Hemp was one of earliest successful industries in Georgetown. In 1789, Craig founded one of the earliest successful ropewalks in Kentucky. Ropewalk and bagging factory Early property records show that the land where the Hawkins House sits belonged to the Hawkins family and was referred to as \\"ropewalk alley\\". Taking full advantage of the plentiful hemp crops in Scott County, Thomas Hawkins established a ropewalk and bagging factory on the property. Land deeds show that the property continued to be used as a hemp establishment as late as the 1850s. Georgetown College Georgetown College bought and sold the building three times. First, in August 1830, after the decision was made to establish a Baptist college in Georgetown, the building was the first property bought by the new institution. After other land was secured for the new school, the property was sold to Joseph Lemon who returned the building to its prior use as a ropewalk and bagging factory. Georgetown College acquired the property for the second time in 1853 from E.N. Eliot. The school held the property until 1858 and used it first as the college president's house and then later as a men's dormitory called Judson Hall. The college bought the house for the last time in 1930 from W.E. Haynes and his wife Frances (Wood) and sold it the next year to Mary Garth Hawkins. Residential dwelling After being used for commercial purposes in the early years, during later years the Hawkins House was used as a residential dwelling for many well known Scott County families. In 1858, J.J. Rucker, a professor of mathematics, purchased the property for use as a home. Dr. J. Campbell Cantrill and his wife resided in the house. Georgetown Female Seminary When Georgetown Female Seminary building burned beyond use, J.J. Rucker used his home, the Hawkins House, to house the women. Sallie Rochester Ford, a graduate of the seminary, became a writer and newspaper editor. Architecture The sections of Hawkins House were built during three time periods. The area on the right is the oldest. The Hawkins House has a central section with two-bay wings attached on both sides to central area. The oldest section of the Hawkins House is the west wing of the structure, and includes six-panel doors and a simple fireplace mantel indicating a construction date as early as 1790. This part of the building has a freestanding chimney and staircase that are independent from the rest of the structure. The east wing of the house has reeded recesses, and reeding on the chair rail and mantels indicating a later construction date.

It consisted of sending selected microorganisms on a three-year interplanetary round-trip in a small capsule aboard the Russian Fobos-Grunt spacecraft in 2011, which was a failed sample-return mission to the Martian moon Phobos. The Fobos-Grunt mission failed to leave Earth orbit,Universe Today, \\"Russian Space Program Prepares for Phobos-Grunt Re-Entry\\", David Warmflash, 13 December 2011 and was destroyed. The goal was to test whether selected organisms can survive an as yet undetermined number of years in deep space by flying them through interplanetary space. The experiment would have tested one aspect of transpermia, the hypothesis that life could survive space travel, if protected inside rocks blasted by impact off one planet to land on another. Precursor Prior to the Phobos LIFE experiment, a precursor LIFE prototype was successfully flown in 2011 aboard the final flight of Space Shuttle Endeavour, STS-134. Known as the Shuttle-LIFE (also LIFEAstrobiology.com, \\"LIFE Launches Aboard Endeavour's Last Flight\\", The Planetary Society, 27 April 2011 (accessed 11-11-2011)) experiment.SPACE.com, \\"Salvaging Science from Stricken Mars Moon Probe: A Scientist's View\\", David Warmflash, 11 November 2011Astrobiology.com, \\"LIFE Ready to Launch on Endeavour's Last Flight\\", The Planetary Society, 16 May 2011 (accessed 11-11-11) The experiment The project includes representatives of all three domains of life: bacteria, eukaryota and archaea. The capsule was transporting 10 types of organisms in 30 self-contained samples, i.e., each in triplicate. In addition, one or more natural native soil samples were flown in their own self-contained capsule. The Phobos-Soil sample return mission was the only attempted biological science mission that would have returned to Earth from deep space, far beyond the protection of Earth's magnetic field; sending biological samples through deep space is therefore a much better test of interplanetary survivability than sending the samples on a typical Earth- orbiting flight. The project was being done in collaboration with the Russian Space Research Institute, the Institute for Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Moscow State University, the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and the Institute for Aerospace Medicine in Germany.  Specimens  Three fundamental guidelines governed the selection of the organisms: First, the organisms selected represent the three domains of life – eukaryote, bacteria and archaea. Second, the organisms are very well studied (e.g., having their genome sequenced and studied in many other experiments) to make it possible to accurately assess the effects of the long exposure to space. If they had already been studied in space conditions so much the better, since it would enable researchers to pinpoint precisely how organisms were affected by the years-long exposure to the interplanetary environment. Finally, a strong preference was given to organisms that appear to stand the best chance of surviving the journey. These are extremophiles, organisms that thrive in conditions that would kill the vast majority of Earthly creatures. The 10 'passenger' organisms selected are listed below: Bacteria *Bacillus safensis **Discovered in JPL's 'clean' room: Spacecraft Assembly Facility.The Planetary Report, Volume XXIX, number 2, March/April 2009, \\"We make it happen!

Capsule design The mass of the Bio-Module on board the Fobos- Grunt spacecraft was 100 grams or less. The design is a short cylinder. The bio-module provided 30 small tubes (3 millimeters in diameter) for individual microbe samples. It also accommodated a native sample of bacteria – derived from a permafrost region on Earth – within a cavity 26 mm in diameter. Mission failure The module passed stress tests including a shake test with vibrations at frequencies to 1,100 Hz and an impact test of 4,000 g, designed to simulate the potential impact of the capsule on Earth.

The film was released as 6 Souls in the United States on 1 March 2013, for video on demand, followed by a limited theatrical release on 5 April 2013.Julianne Moore-Starring Shelter Dusted Off for Release Under Title 6 Souls Shock Till You Drop. 8 February 2013 Plot Dr. Cara Harding (Julianne Moore), a psychologist, recently lost her husband as the two were walking home from church on Christmas Eve. In an attempt to get her more open to accepting unexplainable psychiatric theories, her father (Jeffrey DeMunn) introduces her to Adam (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a patient suspected to have multiple personality disorder, who unnaturally takes on some impossible physical characteristics of his other personalities. At first Cara's father only tells her of one of Adam's personalities, David Bernberg. Cara quickly discovers that David, a personality needing a wheelchair, was a real person who became a paraplegic and was murdered long ago. For more information Cara decides to visit David's mother. She tells Mrs. Bernburg of her patient Adam, and informs her that he has created a personality within himself mimicking her son. David's mother is a highly religious woman, and agrees to meet with Adam in Dr. Harding's attempt to cure him. Adam, as David, reveals to Mrs. Bernberg private details that only her son would know. She tells Adam that he is evil and leaves in distress. Adam over time becomes more aggressive to those around him including Cara and starts to reveal more of his personalities to her; Wes, a singer in a metal band and Satanist who was suspected of committing suicide, being one of them. As Cara tries to help Adam she decides to visit his home to reveal why he may have created these personalities as a form of escapism. Upon entering his home, a filthy degenerated place full of devil-worshiping insignia, Cara discovers a grotesque decomposing body in the bathtub. After calling it into the police Cara goes to collect her daughter Sammy from school. She finds Adam there with her daughter, in the personality of a family friend and questioning Sammy about her faith in God, while the latter tells him that she does not believe anymore because her dad was murdered. Adam is arrested by the police and questioned about the dead body in his house. Cara revisits Mrs. Bernburg and she directs Cara to a woman known as 'Granny' deep in the witch mountains for further answers. After a brief meeting with a witch doctor called Granny, the elderly woman rejects her and sends her away. Cara sneaks back when she hears screams. While spying on Granny and her companions, she witnesses Granny cutting open an old man. She delays the procedure as his screams get more intense and sucks his soul out, blowing it into a container with a strange symbol on it. She continues cutting him open, takes out a cancerous lump from his body and sews him back up before blowing the contained soul back into him. The old man awakes and appears fine. The witch doctor then turns and asks Cara if she still only believes in science. Cara begins to figure things out and realizes that Adam asks about the faith of people when he meets them. She listens to two voice messages on her phone, one from her brother who is looking after her daughter and has some information to help the investigation with Adam. Her brother informs her that there is an old man who may have answers for her relating to the case. Cara rushes to see the man, to talk about what has been happening with her patient. The man relates a story from his childhood, while showing Cara an old silent-film home video that his father had recorded. Long ago there was a priest who came to his town to teach about God, though he himself did not believe. The priest taught that witchcraft and pagan rituals were not needed, but that it was through faith that people could be healed. The town was stricken with an influenza outbreak, but they believed in the faithless priest and depended on the beliefs that he taught them. The town discovered that the priest was actually scamming the town and a nonbeliever, inoculated his two daughters, and allowed his people to die. The townspeople murder his daughters while the witch doctor Granny sucked out his soul and blew it into the air before stuffing his orifices with mud so that his soul could not return to his body. She whispers a curse on him, that his body will be a shelter to the faithless. Cara receives a call from the police that they have released 'Adam' to her father as they discovered that the body in his bathtub was the real Adam who had owned the home. As Cara questions if the police figured out the real identity of her patient, she looks up at the projector screen to see 'Adam' in the midst of the influenza epidemic, realizing that he is the faithless priest from decades ago. She calls her dad frantically as she realizes that 'Adam' is going to kill him. Amid the phone call she listens helplessly as the murder happens with nothing she can do to stop his death. She calls her brother to tell him what she has found out where he tells her that her daughter is getting sick, just as her family friend and father had been, and has a strange symbol burnt on her back. Cara urges her brother to take her daughter to Granny, as she believes this illness is not of temporal nature but spiritual and supernatural. 'Adam' shows up and attacks, incapacitating her brother. Cara tells her daughter to put the phone on speaker and demands that 'Adam' allow her to speak to David. As he transforms back into David he collapses on the floor, as David needs a wheelchair, giving her brother and daughter a chance to escape meeting up with Cara and Granny. After joining the pair of them Cara checks her daughter's back only to see that the symbol appearing thereon is the same one that the container the witch doctor had used to store souls. Granny says she cannot help, as the girl has already given up on God and abandoned him, but that Sammy will be sheltered and together with the other faithless souls. 'Adam' pursues and knocks out Cara's brother, as she runs for safety with her daughter. After overpowering Cara, 'Adam' takes Sammy sucking out her soul. His personality changes into her daughter, revealing that all along 'Adam' has not had DID, but has been the shelter for multiple spirits of people who had abandoned their faith in God. 'Adam' as Sammy gives Cara the opportunity to cradle him, which in so doing gives her the chance to strangle him taking away most of his energy before impaling him through his neck on a sharp root sticking up out of the ground. As the faithless priest 'Adam' dies, all the souls leave his body. Sammy's lifeless body receives her soul back and Cara runs to reunite with her daughter. As the two comfort each other Sammy begins to hum the tune that David wrote, implying that David's soul has found its way into her daughter's body as well.

Salman Abu Sitta (; born 1937) is a Palestinian researcher most known for his ground-breaking project mapping of Palestine in 21st, 20th and 19th centuries and developing a practical plan for implementing the Palestinian right of return of Palestinian refugees. Address to 4th International Convention, San Francisco. Biography Abu Sitta was born in 1937 into a Palestinian family with a long tradition of fierce resistance to occupiers of their land.[citation needed] Since 1922, the land had been under the jurisdiction of the British, under the provision of the British Mandate for Palestine. Prior to this, the Ottomans had ruled the region for four hundred years. Abu Sitta's family's land and the village bore their name, Ma'in Abu Sitta (the Abu Sitta springwell), in Beer Sheba District of Palestine. One morning in April 1948, he and other schoolboys were sent home for safety reasons, after being summoned by the headmaster and told that the Jews had occupied central Palestine.[citation needed] Civil war had broken out between Palestinian Arabs and Jewish colonists fresh from Europe following the United Nations Partition Plan of 29 November 1947, which had recommended the creation of two connected States, each ruled by the majority of population in each part Arab or Jew. The Plan was a mere recommendation, it was not legally binding. The Palestinian Arab refused to give away 55% of their country to new Jewish settlers who arrived from Europe in smugglers ship. But the settlers had an organized army far superior in numbers and arms more the Palestinian defenders. Fighting intensified in the centre of Mandatory Palestine in March, hence the decision of Abu Sitta's headmaster. Abu Sitta made the 40 km journey from Beer Sheba town back to his home on foot, and joined his family. Before the declaration of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, while the British were still in Palestine. the Haganah forces under Plan Dalet started a campaign to occupy large parts of Palestine. They depopulated 220 Palestinian cities and villages making up half the refugees today. Abu Sitta's Al Ma'in was attacked and houses were demolished and burnt. On the day Israel was declared, Abu Sitta became a refugee. In the following day, forces from the neighbouring Arab states, Egypt, Transjordan, Syria and Iraq tried to save the Palestinians from expulsion and massacres but failed. 247 villages in Southern Palestine including Al Ma'in were expelled and found refuge in the tiny Gaza Strip. The Egyptian force, the largest among the Arab armies, came to defend the Palestinians in southern Palestine south of a line from Isdud to Jerusalem where 300,000 Palestinians lived and where a dozen scattered Zionist colonies where planted after WWII. The Egyptians were defeated and the whole southern Palestine was depopulated. All villages and town whose home was southern Palestine (50%) were pushed to Gaza Strip (1.3%). Today Gaza Strip concentration camp has the highest density in the world. Abu Sitta are among them. With the Armistice Agreement of 24 February 1949, Abu Sitta's family remained refugees in Gaza Strip. Abu Sitta then moved to the prestigious al- Saidiya secondary school in Cairo, Egypt, where he graduated with \\"excellence\\", ranking first in Egypt..[citation needed] After graduating from Cairo University's Faculty of Engineering in 1958, Abu Sitta went to the United Kingdom to continue his post-graduate studies, receiving his PhD in Civil Engineering from one of the well-known colleges of the University of London, UCL. After graduating from Cairo University's Faculty of Engineering in 1958, Abu Sitta went to the United Kingdom to continue his post-graduate studies, receiving his PhD in Civil Engineering from one of the well known colleges of the University of London, UCL. He then took positions in London, Canada and Kuwait. His key activities include: * Member of Palestine National Council * Researcher on refugee affairs and author of over 400 papers on the subject * Director of international development and construction projects * Founder and President of the Palestine Land Society (PLS) * General coordinator of the Right of Return Congress. Abu Sitta has engaged in debates with Israelis who profess interest in peace without the return of the refugees, including Uri Avnery and Rabbi Michael Lerner. Documentation of the 1948 Palestinian exodus (al Nakba)[edit] Abu Sitta has spent 40 years digging for any detail of information about or related to Palestine before, during and after al Nakba. Abu Sitta's work has encompassed not only documenting the Nakba in which an estimated 6-800,000 Palestinians were displaced in 1948, but also ensuring that \\"the memories and identity of the occupied homeland are never lost\\". He is regarded by Uri Avnery as perhaps 'the world's foremost expert on the Nakba'. The documentation process began when he was 22 years old, when he was studying in England. \\"It sort of started from there, and it has never stopped,\\" Abu Sitta says. \\"I kept collecting all and any material on every inch of my homeland.\\" Abu Sitta's work was to show that the return of the refugees to their homes is not only sacred to Palestinians, legal under international law but also feasible and possible without major dislocation to the existing Jewish settlers in Palestine.[citation needed] His work also includes the compendium \\"Atlas of Palestine 1917- 1966\\", (Palestine Land Society, London 2010, ) and Arabi edition in 2012, also the Atlas of Palestine 1871-1877, London 2020 depicting Arab Palestine before Zionists colonization. Additionally the Return Journey Atlas (2006) which shows the depopulated Palestinian village lands the Zionist colonies which occupies them today.

Air is confined between the two spirals and is compressed as it is forced towards the centre. In automotive application, the spirals would have far fewer turns. The G-Lader is a scroll-type supercharger used in various Volkswagen Passenger Cars models. Its purpose is to increase the motive power output from the internal combustion engine attainable with a given engine displacement. Since it is not enough to simply inject more fuel, as this produces too rich an air-fuel mixture, more intake air has to be added at the same time. This can be achieved with an exhaust-driven turbocharger, or a crankshaft-driven positive displacement compressor. The G-Lader is in the compressor category, since it is crankshaft-driven and does not have the \\"lag\\" usually associated with turbocharged engines. History This type of air pump, notable for low noise and high efficiency, was patented on 3 October 1905 by Léon Creux of France (US Patent 801,182). Due to the very imprecise production methods of the period, however, it was not manufacturable for a long time, since the displacer (described below) inside the compressor comes within tenths of a millimetre of the housing wall without making contact. Only with the more advanced engineering methods of the 1980s, did it become possible to produce the G-Lader. Contrary to expectations, Volkswagen's designs turned out to need relatively frequent repair in normal operation, which was one of the reasons why that manufacturer eventually abandoned this technology at the time. The main cause of its relatively high failure rate was that Volkswagen misrepresented the G-Lader as maintenance-free. Depending on RPMs, load, and design details, various parts wear out, with results ranging from impaired performance, to destruction of the G-Lader. Yet it is frequently possible to extend the life of the G-Lader, sometimes to several hundred thousand kilometres, by periodically overhauling it with suitable replacement parts. Operation A G-Lader supercharger from a Volkswagen Corrado G60. The supercharger housing holds what is called the displacer plate (or just displacer), on both sides of which are spirals, with seals between the latter and the housing. The housing itself also has spirals on both sides that mesh with those on the displacer. Driven by the crankshaft, which is connected to the displacer shaft by a small belt, the displacer moves eccentrically with respect to the supercharger housing (like the rotor in a Wankel engine) and, through this motion, forces the intake air into a smaller and smaller space, ultimately producing a maximum gauge pressure of with standard delivered pulleys. Sizes and car models The German name G-Lader comes from the shape of the supercharger (), which looks like the letter G. The displacer's spirals are either deep or, in the larger version, deep, i.e. close to 60 mm. This is the reason we see the engine designations G40 and G60 in the names of Volkswagen models in which it was used: *Volkswagen Polo Mk2 GT G40 (Typ 86c - Limited to 500 vehicles first series (all black, fog head lamps) and a second of approx 1500, standards colors plus 500 all black for French market only) *Volkswagen Polo Mk2F GT G40 (Typ 86c) *Volkswagen Golf Mk2 GTI G60 (Typ 19E) *Volkswagen Golf Mk2 G60 Rallye (Typ 19E - limited to 5000 vehicles) *Volkswagen Golf Mk2 G60 Limited (Typ 19E - limited to a special Volkswagen- Motorsport series of 71 vehicles) *Volkswagen Corrado G60 (Corrado - Typ 53I) *Volkswagen Passat (B3) G60 Syncro (Passat - Typ 35I) See also *G60 - for detailed information on the complete G-Lader engines, and subsequent Volkswagen Group forced induction developments References  Category:Superchargers Category:Volkswagen Group engines ","title":"G-Lader"},{"id":"18716473","text":"The Best of Babes In Toyland and Kat Bjelland is a CD/DVD compilation featuring songs by Babes in Toyland and Kat Bjelland's other projects, including her work in Crunt, Katastrophy Wife, and Pagan Babies.

The Society was restored in 1814 by Pius VII. Background The Jesuits had been expelled from Brazil (1754), Portugal (1759), France (1764), Spain and its colonies (1767) and Parma (1768).\\"Dominus ac Redemptor (1773)\\", Institute for Advanced Jesuit Studies, Boston College Though he had to face strong pressure on the part of the ambassadors of the Bourbon courts, Pope Clement XIII always refused to yield to their demands to have the Society of Jesus suppressed. The issue had reached such a crisis point, however, that the question seems to have been the main issue determining the outcome of the conclave of 1769 that was called to elect a successor to Clement XIII. While in France, Spain, and Portugal the suppression had taken place de facto; the accession of a new pope was made the occasion for insisting on the abolition of the order root and branch, de facto and de jure, in Europe and all over the world. Giovanni Cardinal Ganganelli, a Conventual Franciscan friar, was one of five papabile. His position on the \\"Jesuit question\\" was somewhat ambiguous. When asked, he told the anti-Jesuit court cardinals that \\"he recognized in the sovereign pontiff the right to extinguish, with good conscience, the Society of Jesus, provided he observed the canon law; and that it was desirable that the pope should do everything in his power to satisfy the wishes of the Crowns\\".Wilhelm, Joseph. \\"Pope Clement XIV.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 5 Jan. 2015 At the same time, the pro-Jesuit Zelanti believed him to be indifferent or even favourable to the Jesuits. Ganganelli was elected and took the name of Clement XIV. Context For a few years Clement XIV tried to placate the enemies of the Jesuits by treating them harshly: he refused to meet the Superior General, Lorenzo Ricci, ordered them not to receive novices, etc. According to Thomas M. McCoog SJ, \\"the Jesuits themselves began to lose its international patrons: Austria, Prussia and Russia annexed sections of Poland at the first (of three) partitions in the summer of 1772; Victor Amadeus III, married to a sister of the king of Spain, ascended the throne of Sardinia in February of 1773. More significant was the loss of Austrian protection: in order to secure a marriage between her daughter Marie Antoinette to the French Dauphin Louis in 1770, Empress Maria Theresa promised not to impede Bourbon efforts at suppression although she herself had nothing against the Jesuits.McCoog SJ, Thomas M., \\"Jesuit Restoration - Part Two: The Society under Clement XIV\\", Thinking Faith, August 14, 2014 Cardinal François-Joachim de Pierre de Bernis, whose work for the dissolution won him the appointment of French Ambassador to the Holy See, worked with Clement in securing the delays for which the pope had asked. Samples of a papal statement circulated among Bourbon courts for over a year. The final draft was downgraded from a bull to a less important papal brief. But the pressure exercised by the Bourbons of Spain, Naples, and France, and the passive attitude and tacit consent of Austria brought the negotiations to an abrupt termination.Sollier, Joseph. \\"François-Joachim- Pierre de Bernis.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 7 January 2019 The pressure kept building up to the point that Catholic countries were threatening to break away from the Church. It was issued mainly at the instigation of Joseph Moniño, the Spanish ambassador. Clement XIV ultimately yielded \\"in the name of peace of the Church and to avoid of secession in Europe\\" and suppressed the Society of Jesus by the brief Dominus ac Redemptor on 21 July 1773. Content The opening page of Dominus ac Redemptor in French and Latin The document is forty-five paragraphs long. In the introductory paragraph Clement XIV gives the tone: Our Lord has come on earth as \\"Prince of peace\\". This mission of peace, transmitted to the apostles is a duty of the successors of Saint Peter, a responsibility the pope fulfils by encouraging institutions fostering peace and removing, if need be, others that impede peace. Not just if guilty, even on the broader ground of harmony and tranquillity in the Church, it may be justified to suppress a religious order. He mentions as precedence, Pius V's suppression of the Humiliati in 1571, Urban VIII's elimination of the Regular Order of Sts. Ambrose and Barnabas at the Grove, and Innocent X's suppression of the Order of St. Basil of Armenia. What follows is a long section in which Clement XIV reviews the reasons which, in his judgment, are calling for the extinction of the Society of Jesus. # A long list of charges against the Society is enumerated. # He recalls that, in its history, the Society encountered severe criticism. # The distress occasioned to earlier popes by clashes among Catholics with regard to Jesuit doctrine is evoked. In a final, more technical section Clement XIV pronounces the actual sentence of suppression of the Society of Jesus. Some provisions are dictated for the implementation of the brief. In effect, the brief suppresses the Society without condemning it. Execution A second brief Gravissimis ex causis (16 August) established a commission of five cardinals entrusted with the task of informing the Jesuits and handling the many practical problems caused by the suppression. Two days later, a letter of the Cardinal president of the commission ordered all bishops of the Church to proclaim and publish the brief in every Jesuit house, residence or school in the presence of the assembled community of Jesuits. That unusual approach created a good number of problems since there were 22,589 Jesuits, 49 Provinces, 669 Colleges and over 3000 missionaries.\\"Aug 16 1773 - Society of Jesus Suppressed\\", Jesuit Restoration 1814, August 16, 2014 Hundreds of schools were closed or transferred to other religious orders or the state. Non-Catholic countries such as Prussia and Russia forbade the bishops to promulgate the brief and ordered the Jesuits to carry on their academic activities as if nothing had happened.

In a July 2011 article for the People's Forum, Hu wrote that: \\"The CPC has always adhered to the mass line, rooting itself among the people in order to make democratic decisions. This is manifested in the superiority of the socialist policy- making system with Chinese characteristics. This policy-making system is based on the mass line of the Party, that is from the masses, to the masses and putting into practice what has been learned from practice.\\"http://english.qstheory.cn/abstracts/201204/t20120401_149171.htm Hu is also a proponent of China's SOE system, claiming that they are the \\"backbone\\" of national growth in China. In an op-ed for the People's Daily Hu wrote: \\"The Western corporate culture emphasizes individualism, while the State-owned enterprise culture focuses more on harmony and collectivism. A good business model not only creates material wealth, but also creates spiritual wealth. Chinese corporate culture reflects this spiritual wealth, which in turn is a form of internal and external soft power. China, being a huge economy, needs large, internationally competitive State-owned enterprises. This is the only way that China can ensure that its enterprises enjoy a strong position amid fierce international competition.\\"http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2013-07/12/content_16765782.htm This puts him at odds with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang who publicly favors reducing State intervention in the economy and has said that the Government should reduce its role in the economy even if doing so feels \\"like cutting one’s wrist.\\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/china- business/9936059/Chinas-new-premier-Li-Keqiang-to-cut-state-control-over- economy.html Hu is known in China for his strong support of socialism and the Chinese Communist Party. In July 2013 he wrote a controversial op-ed for the People's Daily stating: \\"Compared with the civil society in the West, the people's society is superior... it is a great made-in-China innovation in theory and practice.\\" He went on to say that \\"[t]he people's society is a socialist society under the leadership of the Communist Party.\\" http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1286519/leading-leftist-academic- mocked-over-maoist-op-ed This drew strong criticism within China from social media sites and Chinese academics such as Yu Jianrong. In August 2018 he was criticised in an open letter written by Tsinghua University alumni calling for the university to fire Hu. The letter accused him of using “self-serving criteria” in his research so as to exaggerate claims of China’s greatness. The letter states that Hu espoused an exaggerated sense of national superiority and overt nationalism that both harms China’s foreign relations whilst also misleading the public.

Biography Laforgue was born in Thann (then part of the German Empire) and died in Paris. He studied medicine in Berlin, and in 1919 wrote a thesis on \\"The Affects in Schizophrenia Patients from a Psychoanalytical Point of View\\".J. Damousie, Psychoanalysis and Politics (2012) p. 36 As his interest in psychoanalysis developed, he underwent a training analysis and began a correspondence with Sigmund Freud. In 1926, along with Marie Bonaparte and eight others, he founded the Paris Psychoanalytic Society,E Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (1999) p. 17 where he became one of the most prominent members. His (unsuccessful) attempt to collaborate with the Nazis over the Aryanisation of the society in Paris during the Occupation in World War Two cast something of a shadow over his later career, and in the year of his death, 1962, he was removed from the roster of training analysts by the International Psychoanalytical Association.E Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (1999) p. 154-5 and p. 258 Laforgue is the author of several books on psychoanalysis, albeit more popularising than original;Rene Laforgue (fr) as well as of a variety of articles on subjects ranging from the eroticization of fear in gambling,J. Halliday ed., The Psychology of Gambling (1974) p. 26 through the development of the sense of reality, to such defense mechanisms as psychological repression and isolation.O. Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 633-4 Intellectually however he remained as much indebted to the French tradition of Pierre Janet and Henri Claude as to Freud;E Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (1999) p. 20-22 and the tensions implicit in his competing allegiances contributed to his debate with Freud over the French introduction of the term scotomization. Initially welcomed as a description of the blocking of unpleasant perceptions in hysteria by Freud, the latter swiftly turned against it, arguing that Laforgue himself maintained \\"that 'scotomization' is a term that arises from descriptions of dementia praecox, which does not arise from a carrying over of psychoanalytic concepts\\".S. Freud, On Sexuality (PFL 7) p. 352 Despite their theoretical disagreement, the two men remained on friendly terms, Laforgue visiting the Freuds on occasion in the 1920s: he would in the 1950s write a memoir of them, which offers a rare glimpse of Martha Freud as \\"a practical woman, marvellously skillful in creating an atmosphere of peace and joie de vivre\\".Quoted in P.

He was one of the developers of the concepts of Innere Führung (officially translated as \\"leadership development and civic education\\") and Staatsbürger in Uniform (\\"citizens in uniform\\"), the two lead concepts of the modern German Bundeswehr. Early life Baudissin was born in Trier into the Baudissin family. He studied law, history and economics in Berlin. In World War II, Baudissin served as hauptmann im Generalstab (captain with the General Staff) at the personal request of General Erwin Rommel. He was captured by Australian troops in North Africa in 1941, and sent to Australia, where he was held in the Dhurringile prisoner-of- war camp in Victoria. While a POW, he was promoted to major. At Dhurringile, Baudissin developed the idea of the Kriegsgefangenenuniversität (\\"prisoner-of- war university\\"). He organized classes in which German prisoners with particular knowledge or expertise taught their comrades in various subjects and prepared them for a life after the war. Baudissin was released in 1947. Career in the Bundeswehr In October 1950, Baudissin worked on the secret Himmeroder Denkschrift (\\"Himmerod Memorandum\\"), a paper advocating German rearmament. In 1956 he helped to create the new German armed forces, the Bundeswehr, receiving the rank of colonel, and soon headed a tank brigade. In 1963, he was promoted to lieutenant general and was appointed Commandant of the NATO Defence College in Paris, serving until 1965. Baudissin then served as Deputy Chief of Staff at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), the headquarters of NATO. After the Bundeswehr Baudissin retired in 1967, and became an active member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany the following year. He actively supported Willy Brandt's bid for chancellorship in 1972. From 1971 to 1984, Baudissin served as founding director for the Institut für Friedensforschung und Sicherheitspolitik (\\"Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy\\") at the University of Hamburg. In 1979, he was made professor. From 1980 to 1986, he served as professor for social science at the University of the Bundeswehr in Hamburg.With the concepts of Innere Führung and citizen in uniform he advocated to assure that the norms and values of the German Basic Law were embedded in the new German armed forces following World War II.http://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/parameters/articles/2012summer/koltermann.pdf Baudissin died in Hamburg in 1993. Awards and honors Baudissin was a member of the peace movement group Generale für den Frieden (\\"Generals for Peace\\"). In 1967, he was awarded the Theodor Heuss Prize and the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Great Federal Cross of Merit), with stars and sash. On 19 April 1994, the hall of the Bundeswehr's Zentrum für Innere Führung (\\"Center for Civic Education\\") in Koblenz was renamed \\"Forum Wolf Graf von Baudissin\\".

They are under the jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management. Currently, approximately 88% of Federal employees are located outside the Washington, DC area. Across the nation, in 28 locations with a high concentration of Federal agencies and Federal employees, FEBs provide a forum for Federal leaders to connect to discuss management challenges and strategies. The FEBs enable collaboration on agency missions and goals, common issues,and special initiatives. FEBs are also a resource for agencies to share best practices among their peers. History \\"The first 10 Federal Executive Boards (FEB) were established by Presidential Directive in 1961 to \\"increase the effectiveness and economy of Federal agencies.\\" Currently, 28 FEBs are located nationwide in areas with a significant Federal population. The Boards are composed of local, senior-level Federal agency officials. Today, the Boards are more relevant than at any other time in history. In continuing times of personnel reductions, budget cutbacks and reorganization, interagency collaboration is critical to achieving results. As the local Federal ambassador, the FEB identifies opportunities for partnerships with intergovernmental and community organizations. Interagency collaboration is no longer just a wise choice; it is the platform for meeting agency mission goals. The FEBs are models for partnership-based government. The Boards serve as a vital link to intergovernmental coordination identifying common ground and building cooperative relationships. FEBs also have a long history of establishing and maintaining valuable communication links to prepare for and respond to local and national emergencies. While promoting issues related to Administration initiatives, they provide targeted training programs, employee development, shared resources, and local community outreach and participation.

In one study, roughly 25% of approximately 6300 adults received a musculoskeletal injury of some sort within 12 months—of which 83% were activity-related. Musculoskeletal injury spans into a large variety of medical specialties including orthopedic surgery (with diseases such as arthritis requiring surgery), sports medicine, emergency medicine (acute presentations of joint and muscular pain) and rheumatology (in rheumatological diseases that affect joints such as rheumatoid arthritis). Musculoskeletal injuries can affect any part of the human body including; bones, joints, cartilages, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and other soft tissues. Symptoms include mild to severe aches, low back pain, numbness, tingling, atrophy and weakness. These injuries are a result of repetitive motions and actions over a period of time. Tendons connect muscle to bone whereas ligaments connect bone to bone. Tendons and ligaments play an active role in maintain joint stability and controls the limits of joint movements, once injured tendons and ligaments detrimentally impact motor functions.Frievalds, A. (2011). Biomechanics of the Upper Limbs : Mechanics, Modeling and Musculoskeletal Injuries, Second Edition (2nd edition.). Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, an imprint of Taylor and Francis. Continuous exercise or movement of a musculoskeletal injury can result in chronic inflammation with progression to permanent damage or disability. In many cases, during the healing period after a musculoskeletal injury, a period in which the healing area will be completely immobile, a cast-induced muscle atrophy can occur. Routine sessions of physiotherapy after the cast is removed can help return strength in limp muscles or tendons. Alternately, there exist different methods of electrical stimulation of the immobile muscles which can be induced by a device placed underneath a cast, helping prevent atrophieshttp://www.israel21c.org/bin/en.jsp?enDispWho=Articles^l2262&enPage;=BlankPage&enDisplay;=view&enDispWhat;=object&enVersion;=0&enZone;=Health Preventative measures include correcting or modifying one’s postures and avoiding awkward and abrupt movements. It is beneficial to rest post injury to prevent aggravation of the injury. There are three stages of progressing from a musculoskeletal injury; Cause, Disability and Decision. The first stage arises from the injury itself whether it be overexertion, fatigue or muscle degradation. The second stage involves how the individual’s ability is detrimentally affected as disability affects both physical and cognitive functions of an individual. The final stage, decision, is the individual’s decision to return to work post recovery as Musculoskeletal injuries compromise movement and physical ability which ultimately degrades one’s professional career.  Repetitive use injuries  Injury can be described as a ‘mechanical disruption of tissues resulting in pain.' Despite the fact tissues can self-repair, muscle degradation occurs after repeated and prolonged use. Overuse and strain injuries can occur at work, physical activity and daily life. Repetitive motions strain our musculoskeletal systems, if continued in an improper form can result in chronic inflammation with progression to permanent damage. These injuries can compromise an individual’s posture or other physical abilities, including fine motor movements. Nerves play an important role in repetitive strain injuries as it is nerves that get pulled in injured soft tissues ultimately affecting motor functions. Pressure on the nerve will impair blood flow which can impair either distal or proximal points to the first injury and cause pain. Tendons connect muscle to bone whereas ligaments connect bone to bone. Tendons and ligaments play an active role in maintain joint stability and controls the limits of joint movements, once injured tendons and ligaments detrimentally impact motor functions. Injuries associated with repetitive-use activities include: tennis elbow, tendonitis, wrist injuries, myelopathy, low back injuries and lower leg and ankle injuries. Repetitive use injuries are a result of rapid and continuous movements, long duration postures without adequate support. Excessive muscle use results in fatigue which limits movement of limbs.  Forms of musculoskeletal injuries  An acute injury can be traced back to a specific incident, causing immediate pain and often swelling. On the other hand, a Chronic injury does not have a distinct origin, it develops slowly, is persistent and long lasting, and it is accompanied by dull pain, aches or soreness. Broken Metacarpals from a high impact fall.  Neck and shoulder injury  The shoulder is a joint which allows your arm to move Poor posture can lead to nerve damage. Repetitive shoulder movements, overhead, swinging, throwing or circling movement can cause musculoskeletal injury. Some cases can result in spinal cord damage at the C3-C5 levels, producing a myelopathy which can dramatically compromise overall movements in arm and legs as well as other fine motor functions. Injury to the rotator cuff Is a result of trauma and old age, complete and partial tears are more frequent in older patients caused by degeneration of the tendons.  Wrist and hand injury  Wrist mobility is often restricted due to inflammation of the forearm muscles as they contract and tighten due to injury. Most wrist dislocations occur between the capitate and the lunate.Donovan, A., & Schweitzer, M. (2012). Imaging musculoskeletal trauma : interpretation and reporting. New York: Wiley. Carpal fractures are caused by falling on an outstretched hand the wrist is hyper-extended in ulnar deviation with a component of rotation. Swelling of the Median nerve tissue leads to nerve entrapment ultimately resulting in restriction of movement, other symptoms include; pain, numbness and weakness. DeQuervain’s Tenosynovitis is a form of tendinitis of the muscles that move the thumb.A neck injury associated with high impact vehicle crashes  Leg and foot injury  Most leg pain is transferred pain from our backs or hips. Foot injuries including plantar fasciitis is another source of pain which is associated with-standing for long periods. There are three major tendons that maintain stability at the ankle joint; anterior extensors, medial flexors and lateral peroneal, these tendons facilitate movement around the ankle, foot and toes. Malleolar fractures are related to ankle twisting or shearing injury, these fractures are often associated with ligament injury. An ankle sprain can lead to a spectrum of soft tissue impingement reducing motion in the ankle.  Spinal and neck injury  The spinal column has five sections consisting of thirty three individual vertebrae separated by cushioning discs, the upper three sections are movable and the lower two are fixed. Nerve compression is a result of poor posture, prolonged computer use is an example of repetitive strain injury which affects the musculoskeletal system. Whiplash injury, whereby the force causes strain to the capsule and ligaments of the apophyseal joints of the cervical spine. Hyper-flexion is a common mechanism of injury in the cervical spine associated with an anterior compression vector and a posterior distraction vector. These injuries are associated with diving injuries, falls and car accidents. Anterior compression vector results in mild height loss, whereas hyper-extension often occurs with the posterior displacement of the head in car crashes. Severe hyper-extension injury leads to pinching of the spinal cord along the posterior margin of the body. A common form of strain on ligaments and tendons in the arm.  Elbow injury  The upper arm and the forearm meet to form the elbow joint. Examples of injuries affected on an elbow include; Carpal tunnel syndrome, Radial Tunnel Syndrome and tennis elbow, all of which are due to tendon and ligament damage from overuse or strain. Distal humeral fractures are related to high energy trauma from falling from a height or in a motor vehicle accident, this results in stiffness and restricted range of motion. Elbow dislocation and radial head or neck fractures are common when one falls on an outstretched hand. Elbow Dislocations are divided into two categories; Simple and complex. Simple dislocations are defined as soft tissue injury where ass complex involves a fracture.  Injury prevention  Preventing injuries to workers is essential to maintain an effective organisational management. Repetitive injuries can be prevented by early medical intervention as an effective way to prevent permanent injury. Correcting one’s postures, avoiding abrupt and awkward movements will avoid acute injury. Taking breaks to change your position and moving about instead of remaining static can also reduce risk of injury. Daily body stretches can help elevate pain from hamstrings, back and neck. Creating healthy awareness through social media and celebrities further allow individuals to create healthy practices which ultimately prevent injury.Traffic injury prevention (Online). (2002). Philadelphia, PA: Taylor & Francis.Mohan, D., & Tiwari, G. (2014). Injury Prevention and Control. Hoboken: CRC Press. It is essential for a work environment to comply with safety standards. Workplaces should have upper management implement safety precautions making health and safety the primary goal. Implementation of company policies and procedures in case of serious incident or fatality. Other strategies such as substances abuse programs are effective at reducing the potential for injuries. If musculoskeletal injuries are not prevented, they can develop and become debilitating. It is important to the area of pain. Heat and cold are used to facilitate the healing process, if applied immediately after an acute injury or overuse strain, it will reduce pain and swelling. A healthy workspace is also substantially important including; floor surfaces, ergonomic seating, working heights, working rates and task variability. Understanding the symptoms of repetitive strain injuries such as; Numbness of arms, hands or legs, aches and pains of joints, shoulder and back pain and tingling or burning of arms, legs and feet, allow an individual to self- diagnose and seek medical attention to prevent further aggravation. Pain is the body’s natural way to alert an individual to rest. It is important to rest, if ignored can lead to further problems. It is crucial not to further aggravate the injury and compromise one’s physical movement as it can detrimentally impact general health. Sustaining a secondary injury has a large risk whilst recovering from an initial injury.  Injury recovery  Injuries often limit physical activity and result in immobilisation which is a significant factor in recovery. Symptoms vary from, numbness, tingling, atrophy and weakness which can ultimately lead to permanent damage and disability. Neural injury recovery in acute strokes are compensated with the help of medical drugs. Stretching promotes blood circulation and decreases muscle tension. Repeating motions and actions whilst performing an activity increases an individual’s risk of accumulating acute musculoskeletal injuries. Factors that affect sustaining these injuries include; duration of activity, the force required to complete the activity, the environment of the workplace and work postures. Although, specially advised exercises with stretching promotes blood circulation and increase range of motion and ultimately help decrease muscle tension. Our immune system is our natural mechanism which manages injuries to the musculoskeletal system. Inflammation, redness, swollen tissue are all part of the healing process, during this process new cells are generated to form new tissue. Macro-nutrients are essential components for tissue regeneration. Proteins, carbohydrates and fats are crucial for new muscle tissues. Water allows all biochemical processes to take place including, elimination of waste and toxins via sweat and urination. On the other hand, Micro nutrients include; vitamins, minerals, enzymes, protect cells and DNA from oxidation damages which is evident in the inflammation response and recovery process.  Decision to return to work  Recovery is enhanced by doing activities that make an individual feel better.Hall, A., Wren, M., & Kirby, S. (2013). Care planning in mental health : promoting recovery. (2nd ed.). Hoboken: Wiley.x Recovery from an injury also consists of returning to work or physical exercise. Employers are legally required to provide suitable duties for the person returning to work. It is important to get medical advise on when to return to work. It is important to consider the physical demands of the job, the work environment when deciding to return to work. Once you are approved to return to work or physical exercise it is crucial to maintain both physical and psychological relapse.

A world champion in 2001, Stevenson won her country's first ever Olympic medal in taekwondo, a bronze, at the 2008 Games in Beijing, her third Olympic competition for Great Britain. Controversially eliminated before the medal rounds, she was reinstated following appeal and went on to win the bronze medal final. Stevenson again became world champion in 2011, despite the loss of both her parents to cancer in the preceding year. Stevenson was selected for her home games in London in 2012, where she took the Olympic oath at the opening ceremony on behalf of all the athletes. Her injury-truncated build up to the Games led to an early elimination; she had taken silver at the Olympic qualifiers despite suffering a broken hand. In 2013, Stevenson announced her retirement from competition, and her intention to take up a coaching role in the Great Britain team. Early life Stevenson was born in Doncaster and attended the Don Valley High School in Scawthorpe. She started training taekwondo at the age of 7. Career Stevenson started her career by becoming Junior World Champion in 1998. In 2000, she won the 3rd place in taekwondo at the 2000 Summer Olympics's World Qualification Tournament and qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Women's 67 kg. These achievements won her fame and drew the attention of martial arts superstar Jackie Chan who sponsored her while promoting his film Shanghai Noon in the United Kingdom. But in the 2000 Olympics she lost to Norway's Trude Gundersen in the semifinal and Japan's Yoriko Okamoto in the bronze match. The next year, she became a world champion in the 2001 World Taekwondo Championships's Women's Middleweight, defeating 2000 Summer Olympics gold medalist Chen Zhong in the final. She became the first British Taekwondo World champion. At the 2004 Olympics in the Women's +67 kg event she was eliminated by Venezuela's Adriana Carmona in the first round. She later trained at Sportcity in Manchester and is a member of the Allstars Taekwondo Academy in Doncaster. coached by Master Gary Sykes 2008 Olympics Due to an \\"error\\" in judging, Stevenson almost exited the 2008 Olympics in the quarterfinal stage following her match with China's Chen Zhong, the gold medal favourite. In the final round of the match, the judges failed to award Stevenson two points for a high-kick to the head, which would have put her one point in the lead with 10 seconds remaining. Following the match, the British team representative immediately made an official protest and, after studying video footage of the kick the judges reversed the result of the fight and Stevenson progressed to the semifinal. Stevensons's semifinal opponent was Maria del Rosario Espinoza of Mexico, and she lost 4–1, also sustaining a twisted ankle. She then went on to compete for bronze in the repechage, defeating Noha Abd Rabo of Egypt and winning Britain's first Olympic medal in the sport of taekwondo. On announcing the change of result in the quarter final, the tournament director said: > \\"The competition supervisory board has looked into this matter deeply, has > made video analysis which has been open to all the referees and judges. In > applying paragraph two of page 64 of the competition rules of the World > Taekwondo Federation we have to change this result and we have to declare > the British player as winner. We are very sorry to the spectators of China > but justice is first. Thank you for understanding.\\" As a result of this judging error in particular, emphasis may be switching to having electronic scoring equipment contained within the actual body protectors themselves, and many tournaments are now using these in trial phase. However, since this technology is far from refined, and due to tactical differences needed in gameplay and style, Stevenson, and athletes from other National Teams, currently do not favour this system and often boycott such tournaments. 2012 Olympics At the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, Sarah Stevenson was chosen to take the Competitors oath. She lost to American Paige McPherson in the preliminary round.

These can be created using various programs, including a simple word processing document that includes links to websites. Distinguishing characteristics A WebQuest is distinguished from other Internet-based research by four characteristics. First, it is classroom-based. Second, it emphasizes higher-order thinking (such as analysis, creativity, or criticism) rather than just acquiring information. And third, the teacher preselects the sources, emphasizing information use rather than information gathering. Finally, though solo WebQuests are not unknown, most WebQuests are group work with the task frequently being split into roles. Structure A WebQuest has 5 essential parts: introduction, task, process, resources, evaluation, and conclusion. The original paper on WebQuests had a component called guidance instead of evaluation. Task The task is the formal description of what the students will produce in the WebQuest. The task should be meaningful and fun. Creating the task is the most difficult and creative part of developing a WebQuest. Process The steps the students should take to accomplish the task. It is frequently profitable to reinforce the written process with some demonstrations. Resources The resources the students should use. Providing these helps focus the exercise on processing information rather than just locating it. Though the instructor may search for the online resources as a separate step, it is good to incorporate them as links within the process section where they will be needed rather than just including them as a long list elsewhere. Having off-line resources like visiting lecturers and sculptures can contribute greatly to the interest of the students. Evaluation The way in which the students' performance will be evaluated. The standards should be fair, clear, consistent, and specific to the tasks set. Conclusion Time set aside for reflection and discussion of possible extensions. Use in education Webquests can be a valuable addition to a collaborative classroom. One of the goals is to increase critical thinking by employing higher levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy and Webb’s Depth of Knowledge. This is a goal of the American educational system's Common Core and many new American state standards for public education. Since most webquests are done in small collaborative groups, they can foster cooperative learning and collaborative activities. Students will often be assigned roles, allowing them to roleplay in different positions, and learn how to deal with conflict within the group. Webquests can be a versatile tool for teaching students. They can be used to introduce new knowledge, to deepen knowledge, or to allow students to test hypotheses as part of a final interaction with knowledge. The integration of computers and the Internet also increase students’ competency with technology. By having specific task lists, students can stay on task. By having specific sources of information, students can focus on using resources to answer questions rather than vetting resources to use which is a different skill altogether. In inclusive classrooms (classrooms that have students of varying exceptionalities interacting such as learning disabled, language impaired, or giftedness) tasks can be differentiated to a skill level or collaborative groups for the same level of task. A skill level may have students with learning disabilities working on a basic task to meet the minimum standard of learning skills and gifted students pushing their task to the higher end of the learning skill. More commonly, groups are composed of learners of all skill levels and completing the same level of task. This is typically easier because the teacher is only creating one webquest, but can cause less student interaction from lower students and less learning from higher students. Limitations of WebQuests WebQuests are only one tool in a teacher's toolboxes. They are not appropriate to every learning goal. In particular, they are weak in teaching factual total recall, simple procedures, and definitions. WebQuests also usually require good reading skills, so are not appropriate to the youngest classrooms or to students with language and reading difficulties without accommodations. One might ask an adult to assist with the reading or use screen-reading technologies, such as VoiceOver or Jaws. How WebQuests are developed Learners typically complete WebQuests as cooperative groups. Each learner within a group can be given a \\"role,\\" or specific area to research. WebQuests may take the form of role-playing scenarios, where students take on the personas of professional researchers or historical figures. A teacher can search for WebQuests on a particular topic or they can develop their own using a web editor like Microsoft FrontPage or Adobe Dreamweaver. This tool allows learners to complete various tasks using other cognitive toolsboxes (e.g. Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Access, Excel, and Publisher). With the focus of education increasingly being turned to differentiated instruction, teachers are using WebQuests more frequently. WebQuests also help to address the different learning styles of each students. The number of activities associated with a WebQuest can reach almost any student. WebQuests may be created by anyone; typically they are developed by educators. The first part of a WebQuest is the introduction. This describes the WebQuest and gives the purpose of the activity. The next part describes what students will do. Then is a list of what to do and how to do it. There is usually a list of links to follow to complete the activity. Finally, WebQuests do not have to be developed as a true web site. They may be developed and implemented using lower threshold (less demanding) technologies, (e.g. they may be saved as a word document on a local computer). Many Webquests are being developed by college students across the United States as a requirement for their k-12 planning e-portfolio. Developments in WebQuest methodologies The WebQuest methodology has been transferred to language learning in the 3D virtual world Second Life to create a more immersive and interactive experience. Tools WebQuests are simple webpages, and they can be built with any software that allows you to create websites. Tech-savvy users can develop HTML in Notepad or Notepad++, while others will want to use the templates available in word processing suites like Microsoft Word and OpenOffice. More advanced web development software, like Dreamweaver and FrontPage, will give you the most control over the design of your webquest. Webquest templates allow educators to get a jump start on the development of WebQuest by providing a pre-designed format which generally can be easily edited. These templates are categorized as \\"Framed\\" or \\"Unframed,\\" and they can have a navigation bar at the top, bottom, left, or right of the content. There are several websites that are specifically geared towards creating webquests. Questgarden, Zunal, and Teacherweb all allow teachers to create accounts, and these websites walk them through the process of creating a webquest. OpenWebQuest is a similar service, although it is based in Greece and much of the website is in Greek. These websites offer little control over design, but they make the creation process very simple and straightforward. Alternatively, teachers can use one of a number of free website services to create their own website and structure it as a webquest. Wordpress and Edublogs both allow users to create free blogs, and navigation menus can be created to string a series of pages into a webquest. This option offers a greater deal of flexibility than pre-made webquests, but it requires a little more technical know-how. ReferencesFurther reading * Dodge, B.

He was widely known on both sides of the Atlantic. Known as serious commentator of parliamentary affairs, he was also an accomplished humorist, and a parliamentary sketch-writer; acknowledged as the first great lobby correspondent. To the British and men like Ernest Shackleton, who named a mountain after him in Antarctica, he was a hero. But New York journalists saw the Englishmen as a mild joke. The mixed perceptions of his real personality have been left to modern biographers to decipher in more depth.A Much Misunderstood Man: Selected Letters of Ambrose Bierce, Ambrose Bierce, S. T. Joshi, Tryambak Sunand Joshi, David E. Schultz  Life and career  Henry Lucy was born in Crosby, near Liverpool in 1842, the son of Robert Lucy, a rose-engine turner in the watch trade, and his wife, Margaret Ellen Kemp. He was baptised, William Henry on 23 April 1843 at St. Michael's Church, Crosby. While he was still an infant the family removed to Everton, Liverpool, where he attended the private Crescent School until August 1856; thereafter until 1864 he was junior clerk to Robert Smith, hide merchant, of Redcross Street, Liverpool. While working as a clerk he had poetry published in the Liverpool Mercury; taught himself shorthand. Worked for the Shrewsbury Chronicle as chief reporter from 1864, and for Shrewsbury's local Observer, and the Shropshire News. Before giving notice to the Chronicle he wrote leader articles for the other Shrewsbury papers which mostly replied to his own leaders in the Chronicle the week before, besides writing 'penny-a-liners' of Shropshire news for London newspapers. Lucy married on 29 October 1873 Emily Anne (1847–1937), daughter of his old schoolmaster at Liverpool, John White. There were no children of the marriage. He lived in Paris during 1869, and learned French. After returning to England he wrote for Pall Mall Gazette from 1870, and Parliamentary reporter for Daily News from 1873. He stayed with the Liberal newspaper for which he was promoted the editor: and Parliamentary sketch writer for Punch from 1881. Used the nom-de-plume \\"Toby, M.P.\\" from 1881 to 1916. Wrote the weekly column \\"The Essence of Parliament\\" in Punch magazine for 35 years. When not writing under one of his pseudonyms, he was usually styled Henry W. Lucy. In 1880, he began writing for The Observer the Cross bench column, which continued for twenty-nine years. His remarkable flair for politics and parliamentary affairs soon brought him to the front rank of his profession. photo of Sir Henry Lucy, signed 'Toby, M.P.', Punch Lucy's lasting memorial is in the volumes he compiled from his Punch parliamentary sketches: A Diary of Two Parliaments (2 vols., 1885–6); A Diary of the Salisbury Parliament, 1886–1892 (1892); A Diary of the Home Rule Parliament, 1892–1895 (1896); A Diary of the Unionist Parliament, 1895–1900 (1901); and The Balfourian Parliament, 1900–1905 (1906). They amount to a history of the Commons in its heyday and have been extensively mined by historians. Lucy was a long-running friend and fund-raiser for Shackleton's expeditions to the South Pole. His generosity exceeded Shackleton's expectations, guaranteeing its success. Knighted in 1909, he was the first lobby correspondent to be seen as the social equal of the politicians in the Commons whom he reported. He rose to national prominence during the constitutional crises of 1909-10 during which he revealed that the truth to the Commons about Navy estimates being as much as £60 million all along. His article was used as evidence by Hugh Foster MP to demand clarity from the government on the budgetary proposals being blocked in the Lords.FINANCE BUSINESS (PROCEDURE).HC Deb 21 March 1910 vol 15 cc777-839 His London home was at 42 Ashley Gardens, and he was a member of the National Liberal Club.

He is a three-time European champion having won the −80 kg title at the European Taekwondo Championships in 2010, 2012 representing Great Britain and 2014 representing the Isle of Man, and was the world junior champion in the −78 kg division in 2008. He represented Great Britain in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where he reached the semi-final and was narrowly defeated in the bronze medal match. He was controversially left out of the British team for the 2012 Olympic Games in London despite being the world no. 1-ranked competitor in the −80 kg division when the British Taekwondo Control Board selected Lutalo Muhammad (who was ranked world no. 59 in −80 kg and world no. 7 in −87 kg). Following this, Cook indicated he could no longer work with the governing authorities in Great Britain, and switched allegiance to the Isle of Man. This move to a non- Olympic nation ostensibly allowed Cook to achieve qualification for the 2016 Summer Olympics for Great Britain, the country for which Isle of Man athletes participate at the Olympics. He represented the Isle of Man in international tournaments from February 2013 until 2015 when following further discussions with the Great Britain authorities, Cook sought and obtained Moldovan citizenship and announced that he would compete for Moldova. At the 2015 World Taekwondo Championships, Cook represented his new country for the first time, losing to former Great Britain teammate Damon Samsum in the semi-final. Despite this, Cook won the bronze medal in his weight category, his first medal in a World Championship. Cook has not won a tournament gold medal since 2015, but took home the silver in the 2018 European Taekwondo Championships in Kazan in the 80 kg weight category. Early life He was born in Dorchester, Dorset. Career=International breakthrough Cook made his breakthrough into senior competition at the 2007 Dutch Open Championships, held in Eindhoven, at the age of 16. He took bronze in his debut senior competition, losing to French athlete Torann Mazeroi 12–10 in the semi-finals. The following week Cook appeared in the German Open Championships in Bonn and took his maiden senior open title. In the final he defeated his fellow British competitor Davoud Etminani 12–11. He then went to compete and secured his place on the British team for the 2007 World Taekwondo Championships at a closed-door round robin competition held at Loughborough University. At the 2007 World Taekwondo Championship he defeated Gauti Mar Gundason of Iceland in the first round. In the second round he faced the toughest opponent of his young career, Hadi Saei of Iran who had won gold medals at both the 2005 World Taekwondo Championships and the 2004 Olympic Games. Cook could not get past the experienced Iranian and lost with a score of 11–6. Later in his debut year, Cook qualified for a spot on the British team for the 2008 Olympic Games by competing at the 2007 World Qualification Tournament held at the MEN Arena in Manchester. In the first round he faced Ireland's Sean Joyce and won 9–2. He then won with the same score against Switzerland's Markus Jiskra. In the last 16, Cook faced Philippines' Alexander Briones and won with a score of 5–2. In the quarter-finals, Cook's tournament ended in a 5–3 defeat to the 6 ft 5in Italian Mauro Sarmiento. 2008 Olympic Games At the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Cook began by defeating Anju Jason of the Marshall Islands 7–0 in his first match. The second match was against a stronger competitor, but he defeated Carlos Vasquez of Venezuela 5–2. In the semi-finals Cook lost to Italy's Mauro Sarmiento. Cook and Sarmiento had been tied 5–5 with going into the last 10 seconds of the bout, but Sarmiento scored a crucial late strike to win 6–5. After defeat his semi-final defeat, Cook faced Zhu Guo of China in the bronze medal match. Cook lost the match 4–1. He was baffled that the British supporting team did not make an appeal during the first round of the bout when the judges missed a clear offensive kick which connected with the Chinese fighter's head which would have given Cook a 2–1 lead. Cook was later penalised a point for receiving two warnings. World Taekwondo Tour 2009 At the inaugural World Taekwondo Tour event in Mexico City, Cook came from behind to defeat the American former Olympic and world champion Steven López with a knockout victory in the −80 kg final. In the second round of the match, Cook sent López to the floor with a headshot. After winning £17,880 Cook said \\"To beat the world champion makes it the greatest win in my career so far. It is amazing to take gold.\\" 2012 Summer Olympics Cook became the world no. 1-ranked competitor in the −80 kg division for the first time in June 2010. Following a surprise defeat in his opening bout at the 2011 World Taekwondo Championships, Cook decided to leave British Taekwondo's training programme and focus on his own training programme using his own coaches, including ex Manchester United F.C Strength and Conditioning coach Mick Clegg and funded by his own sponsors. After leaving the British Taekwondo set-up, he won a number of tournaments including the Olympic test event in London in December 2011 as well as successfully defending his −80 kg title at the 2012 European Championships. He regained the world no. 1 ranking a few months before the 2012 Olympic Games in London. The British Taekwondo Control Board selected Lutalo Muhammad as their competitor in the −80 kg instead of Cook for the olympics. Muhammad was the European champion in the non-Olympic −87 kg category, and was ranked the world no. 7 in the −87 kg division and the world no. 59 in the −80 kg division. Cook had won two of the three competitive bouts between himself and Muhammad and had considerably more international competitive experience. His omission was controversial and he considered legal action to overturn the decision, his agent saying: \\"If the British world number one and reigning European Champion does not compete, it will be a national disgrace. This is an embarrassment not only for the sport of taekwondo internationally, but also for Great Britain's international reputation in hosting the London 2012 Games.\\" Many in the British sporting community and the press voiced concerns that Cook had been deliberately overlooked due to his decision to leave the British Taekwondo training programme as this had left the national association feeling slighted by Cook. However, Team GB Taekwondo performance director Gary Hall commented on the controversy by saying: \\"In some ways, Aaron has a bigger marketing machine than the whole of GB Taekwondo.\\" Women's world champion Sarah Stevenson defended the selection, saying that: \\"To be world number one on a rankings system is not what taekwondo is, it doesn't mean you're the best in the world. I don't even care or know what ranking I am, and people need to realise this. It's really unfair that GB Taekwondo are getting criticised for not picking a world number one.\\" The British Olympic Association (BOA) initially refused to ratify Muhammad's selection, but eventually endorsed the decision after a second selection committee meeting, held with a BOA observer present, led to a confirmation of Muhammad's selection. Competitor for Isle of Man Aaron Cook (blue) at the Euro 2014 in Baku. Final against Damon Sansum Following his omission from the British Olympic team, Cook decided to represent the Isle of Man (a British Crown dependency) instead of Great Britain in international competitions. Athletes from the Isle of Man are eligible to represent Great Britain in the Olympic Games. Cook represented the Isle of Man for the first time at the 2013 Swedish Open, going on to win the gold medal in the −80 kg category. Competing for the Isle of Man, Cook won the gold medal at the Pan American Open in Mexico in 2013 by beating Beat Mexico 15–3, Canada 16–4, USA 14–5 and Costa Rica in final 12–3. He was also awarded best fighter in the tournament. At the end of 2013, Cook again regained the world no. 1 ranking in the −80 kg division. In 2014, Cook won the −80 kg title at the European Championships for the third time, beating Britain's Damon Sansum in the final. Moldovan citizenship After 12 months of further discussion between Cook, British Taekwondo and the BOA, after an approach by Moldovan billionaire Igor Iuzefovici, who is also president of Moldova's taekwondo federation, sponsored by Iuzefovici, Cook gained Moldovan citizenship and a passport. He announced in April 2015 his intention to represent Moldova specifically at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. In April 2015 the British Olympic Association agreed to Cook's request to switch nations. Cook won a bronze medal for Moldova at the 2015 World Taekwondo Championships in Russia in May 2015 where he was beaten by Damon Sansum. 2016 Summer Olympics Representing Moldova, Cook was eliminated in the last sixteen by Liu Wei-ting of Chinese Taipei with a score of 14-2. 2018 Competing for Moldova at the 24th Zagreb Open in Croatia, Cook won Gold after beating Luka Horvat 24-7 in the Male -80kg Final. This result was closely followed by a dominant display at the 14th French Open in Paris in which Cook once again claimed Gold in the -80kg male final by beating Maxime Potvin of Canada 19-15.

McConnell (1922-1954) directed by Gordon Douglas. McConnell served as a navigator in World War II before becoming the top American ace during the Korean War and was killed on August 25, 1954, while serving as a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert, California. The Warner Brothers production, filmed in CinemaScope and Warner Color, stars Alan Ladd as McConnell and June Allyson as his wife. Longtime Warners staff composer Max Steiner wrote the musical score for the film. Plot In 1941, Joseph \\"Mac\\" McConnell, Jr. (Alan Ladd), a private in the Army medical corps near Fitchburg, Massachusetts, aspires to be a pilot, even going AWOL to take private lessons. While flying with his instructor, he realizes that military police are waiting for him at the airport and to avoid arrest, he parachutes out of the aircraft and hitches a ride with teenager Bob Brown (Robert Ellis). Bob takes Mac home with him where he meets Bob's mother (Sarah Selby), young brother Ronnie (Ray Ferrell) and sister Pearl (June Allyson), whom Mac nicknames \\"Butch\\". With the military police on his trail, Mac leaves by a back window and returns to the base, where his superior, Sgt. Sykes (Frank Faylen), sentences him to the stockade. Mac sneaks out and returns to the Brown home to see Butch, and later, after a brief courtship, proposes to her at a boxing match. Sykes reluctantly gives his permission and recommends Mac's promotion and transfer to a medical school in Texas, but the transfer comes through on the McConnells' wedding day, preempting their honeymoon. At the new base, Mac persuades his instructors that he belongs in flight school. When he is transferred to Washington state, a pregnant Butch returns home. During Christmas leave, Mac tries to hitchhike across country, but gives up when he realizes he will not arrive in time for the birth. Again in trouble, Mac is sentenced to sentry duty but learns about his daughter's birth from fellow student, Ty Whitman (James Whitmore). Despite wanting to become a pilot, Mac is assigned as a navigator on a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. While flying over France, his bomber is attacked by a new German jet aircraft and after crash landing, the aircrew is rescued. In peacetime, Mac is miserable at a desk job in Nebraska. When Ty tells him about the Air Force's recruitment of experienced fliers, he volunteers. Butch supports Mac's decision. Feeling he was \\"born to fly,\\" Mac makes his first solo flight on one of the new jet aircraft. Mac is transferred from base to base with his family, which eventually includes another daughter and son. Before he is sent to fight in the Korean War, Mac takes Butch on a picnic in Apple Valley, California, where he has bought property and plans to build a house. Aircraft passing overhead fly in the \\"missing man formation\\" which Mac explains that the pilots are honoring a colleague who was killed. In Korea, Mac helps to rescue men on a downed aircraft in the middle of enemy territory. During another mission, his North American F-86 Sabre is shot down over the sea and he must parachute to safety. Mac becomes the \\"top ace\\" in the conflict, downing 15 MiG-15 fighters. He is named the first triple jet ace in history, but after shooting down his 16th MiG, Ty and his superiors fear that he is getting tired and reckless and transfer him stateside to train new pilots. Back home, Mac is given a hero's welcome and meets the president. When the family settles down in Apple Valley, their neighbors present them with the keys to a house specially built for them. Ty, now a colonel, asks Mac to take a job testing new jets but Butch is afraid for his safety. Mac tests the F-86H Sabre, the newest version of the F-86, flying faster and faster, despite Ty's warning to slow down. Suddenly the controls are frozen and Ty radios Mac to bail out. Believing that he can regain control, Mac is killed in the subsequent crash. Butch sees aircraft overhead in the missing man formation, and realized what happened. Months later, Ty takes Butch to the base where she learns that modifications prompted by Mac's accident, will save lives.

Udvar-Hazy Center in Washington D.C. The National Space Council is a body within the Executive Office of the President of the United States created in 1989 during the George H.W. Bush administration, disbanded in 1993, and reestablished in June 2017 by the Donald Trump administration. It is a modified version of the earlier National Aeronautics and Space Council (1958–1973). The National Space Council operates as an office of policy development and handles a portfolio of civil, commercial, national security, and international space policy matters. Composed of cabinet-level members and supported by a Users Advisory Group, the council is chaired by the Vice President of the United States. National Aeronautics and Space Council (NASC)= 1958–1973 Established by the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, the NASC was chaired by the President of the United States (then Dwight Eisenhower). Other members included the Secretaries of State and Defense, the NASA Administrator, the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, plus up to four additional members (one from the federal government and up to three from private industry) chosen at the President's discretion. The Council was allowed to employ a staff to be headed by a civilian executive secretary. Eisenhower did not use the NASC extensively during the remainder of his term, and recommended at the end of his last year in office, that it be abolished. He did not fill the post of executive secretary but named an acting secretary on loan from NASA. Shortly before assuming office, President-elect John F. Kennedy announced that he wanted his Vice President, Lyndon Johnson, to become chairman of the NASC, requiring an amendment to the Space Act. Edward C. Welsh was the first executive secretary of the NASC, appointed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. Welsh, who as a legislative aide to Senator Stuart Symington (D-Missouri) helped draft the 1958 legislation that created NASA and the NASC, spent the 1960s as the principal advisor to the White House on space issues. He also assisted in the development of the legislation that created the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT). After his retirement in 1969, he remained active as an advisor to NASA. National Space Council =1989–1993  George H.W. Bush created the National Space Council by Executive Order 12675. The Council was chaired by Vice President Dan Quayle and included the following members: * The Secretary of State * The Secretary of the Treasury * The Secretary of Defense * The Secretary of Commerce * The Secretary of Transportation * The Director of the Office of Management and Budget * The Chief of Staff to the President * The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs * The Assistant to the President for Science and Technology * The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency * The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Disbanding On February 12, 1992, friction between the largely astronaut- based management at NASA and the National Space Council led to Richard Truly, then NASA Administrator and a former astronaut, being removed from the council. Truly was forced out after Vice President Quayle and the space council's executive director, Mark J. Albrecht, enlisted the aid of Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff, in urging Pres. Bush to remove Truly. Quayle and the council staff made the move because they felt Truly would impede a new plan to restructure and streamline many aspects of the space program, including the space agency administration. In 1993, the Space Council was disbanded and its functions absorbed by the National Science and Technology Council. In August 2008, when campaigning for president, Barack Obama promised to re-establish the National Aeronautics and Space Council. However, he completed two terms as president without having done so. 2017 revival Pence (center) speaks at the sixth meeting of the revived council in 2019 In October 2016, Robert Smith Walker and Peter Navarro, two senior policy advisers to GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, wrote in an op-ed in SpaceNews that if elected, Trump would reinstitute a national space policy council headed by the vice president. In the first year of the Trump administration, Vice President Mike Pence indicated that the space council would be re-established, and would have a significant involvement in the direction of America's activities in space. On June 30, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order for such a reestablishment. The revival of the National Space Council and the drafting of the Executive Order was led by Trump senior advisor Peter J. White. Following its re-institution, the council met for the first time on October 5, 2017 at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center and Space Museum in Chantilly, Virginia.

From there, an on-road bike route connects through Watervliet, Green Island and Cohoes to the Mohawk River section. The trail continues west from Cohoes along the Mohawk River with occasional on-road segments, connecting the communities of Colonie, Niskayuna, Schenectady, Pattersonville, Amsterdam, Fultonville, Canajoharie, and Fort Plain before ending in Little Falls. From here, the Erie Canalway Trail continues westward into Herkimer County, connecting to western New York and eventually ending in Buffalo. Much of the trail is a rail trail, created from portions of the Troy & Schenectady Railroad, which was taken out of service on January 15, 1965. Most of the portion from the Northway to Schenectady was still owned by the Penn Central railroad as of 1973. While the trail is nearing completion, there are still a few gaps in the trail where it follows local roads. One such section follows Island View Road under the Thaddeus Kosciusko Bridge, which carries Interstate 87 over the Mohawk River, and another follows local roads through the cities of Cohoes and Watervliet, as well the Village of Green Island. Other on-road sections include a section following local roads through the Stockade Historic District in Schenectady, and a section of Route 5S in Pattersonville. These gaps are expected to be filled by the end of 2020 as part of the Empire State Trail project. The Mohawk-Hudson Bike-Hike Trail is the backbone of the trail network of the Capital Region, with direct connections to the Albany County Rail Trail, the Black Bridge Trail, the Champlain Canalway Trail, the ALCO Heritage Trail, the Uncle Sam Trail, and soon the Albany Hudson-Electric Trail. It is generally regarded as the Capital Region's premier linear park, and is by far the most heavily used, based on a 2016 survey of trail users. An estimated 264,000 use the trail at Lions Park in Niskayuna, and an estimated 203,000 use the trail at the Corning Preserve in Albany - these are the trail's busiest access points. Bathrooms are available at Rotterdam Kiwanis Park, Jeff Blatnick Town Park (seasonal), Niskayuna Lions Park (seasonal), Colonie Town Park (seasonal), and the Corning Preserve.

The organization publishes a bi-monthly magazine called Poets & Writers Magazine, and is headquartered in New York City. History In 1970, the director of New York’s famed 92nd Street YM-YWHA Poetry Center, Galen Williams, leveraged seed money from the New York State Council on the Arts to launch a new organization for writers that would provide them with fees for giving readings and teaching workshops. The organization began in an apartment on the fringe of the Theater District. Since that time, Poets & Writers has grown into one of the largest nonprofit organizations in the country for writers of poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Poets & Writers cultivated new sources of revenue, enabling the organization to expand its programs and publications. Award-winning editorial and design changes elevated Poets & Writers Magazine to new subscription and advertising levels. The organization’s Readings/Workshops program was offered in new regions across the country, connecting writers and audiences in California, Chicago and Detroit, in addition to New York State, where the program began. And the Writers Exchange program, which would introduce writers to the New York literary community, was initiated. In 2006, Poets & Writers successfully completed its first capital campaign, raising $3 million and establishing an endowment to bring the Readings/Workshops program to six new cities: Atlanta, Houston, New Orleans, Seattle, Tucson, and Washington, D.C. Magazine Poets & Writers Magazine is a widely distributed bi-monthly magazine. The publication features literary-based news articles, critical reviews and interviews with prominent authors. Poets & Writers Magazine also serves as a resource for thousands of writers, with up-to-date information on literary grants and awards, literary magazines, presses, jobs, author directories and literary events. It's been called the \\"must-have journal for scribes.\\" Beginning with the May/June 2010 issue, the magazine has been available in digital format. Prizes sponsored=Jackson Poetry Prize The Jackson Poetry Prize, established in 2006, honors an American poet of exceptional talent who has published at least one book of recognized literary merit but has not yet received major national acclaim.

It was first instituted by the 1992 Rabbani regime, and adopted by the Taliban when they took power in 1996.  History  Established in 1996, the vice and virtue ministry received heavy subsidies and training from Saudi Arabia. When the Taliban took over Kabul, the committee announced a ban on sorcery and American-style haircuts. It was closed when the Talibans were ousted, but Shinwari, an outspoken advocate of orthodoxy and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Afghanistan reinstated it in 2003, and renamed it the Ministry for Haj and Religious Affairs. In 2006 the Karzai regime submitted draft legislation to create a new department, under the Ministry for Haj and Religious Affairs, devoted to the \\"Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice\\". According to Ghazi Suleiman Hamed, Deputy Minister for Haj and Religious Affairs, the new Department would operate more benignly than the Taliban version. The minister of Haj and religious affairs Nematullah Shahrani stated that the new department would focus on alcohol, drugs, crime and corruption, even though Afghanistan’s criminal laws already addressed these issues. According to Human Rights Watch, reinstating the virtue and vice department would have a negative impact on women rights, a major lever of development for the country. Shukria Barakzai, a member of Afghanistan's National Legislature, saw in this draft legislation a reminiscing legacy of the Taliban era. Felice D. Gaer, Chair of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, stated that the USA expressed a strong opposition to reinstatement of the ministry of virtue and vice, calling it a violation to religious freedom rights.  Description  In the book Taliban by Ahmed Rashid, the ministry is referred to as the Department of the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. Maulvi Qalamuddin, the head of the ministry during the Taliban era, preferred the English translation Department of Religious Observances.Rashid, Ahmed.

Life He became a Jesuit novice at the age of twenty-two and migrated in 1727 to Louisiana, with a group of Ursuline nuns. Soon after his arrival, he was sent to the Illinois mission. In 1728 he was recorded at Post Vincennes, \\"the fort on the Wabash\\" [River], which was established about that time. On 1 January 1730, Doutreleau set out for New Orleans on business connected with the mission. In the previous two months, the Natchez Indians had massacred all the inhabitants of the small French village of Natchez and the Yazoo, a neighboring Indian tribe, also attacked the French. Two Jesuit missionaries, fathers Paul Du Poisson (resident priest of Arkansas Post who had been visiting Natchez)Rev. Donald A. Hawkins, S.J., \\"Pioneer Jesuits in the South: 1566-1763\\", Jesuits of the New Orleans Province, accessed 3 May 2010 and Jean Rouel, were killed in these uprisings. Ignorant of the hostilities and accompanied by four or five French voyageurs, Father Doutreleau landed at the mouth of the Yazoo River to offer up the Mass. The Yazoo attacked the small party, killing one of the Frenchmen and wounding the missionary. Doutreleau escaped to his canoe with two of his companions; they fled down the Mississippi. When they reached the French camp at Tunica Bay, their wounds were dressed. After a night's rest, they continued and made it to New Orleans without attacks. They had accomplished a journey of four hundred leagues through a hostile country. Shortly after, Father Doutreleau became chaplain of the French colonial troops in Louisiana. He accompanied them on one expedition. At his own request, he was sent back to the Illinois Indians, but how long he remained in the Illinois Country is uncertain. At one time Doutreleau was chaplain of the hospital at New Orleans. In 1747 he returned to France, after twenty years as a missionary in the Mississippi Valley.

Along with Eino Leino in the early 20th century, he is considered as a pioneer of Finnish poetry. Manninen translated the works of Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Heine, Ibsen, Petőfi and Runeberg into Finnish. Life Manninen was born in Kangasniemi as a farmer's son. He was one of the ten children of Topias and Matilda Manninen. After passing the matriculation examination in 1892, he was admitted into the University of Helsinki, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1897. From 1898-99 he was an assistant editor of the periodical Valvoja. His early translations of Heinrich Heine were published in Koitar, the student magazine of the university, in 1897. Parts of Heine's Saksanmaa (Deutschland. Ein Wintermärchen) were published in Valvoja in 1900 while the complete translation was published in 1904. From 1907–1909 Manninen worked for the Finnish National Theatre. In 1913 he became a teacher of Finnish language at the University of Helsinki, where he remained until 1937. Manninen was a member of editorial staff of several non-fiction books, including an encyclopedia named Tietosanakirja (1909–21), and the chairperson of the National Council for Literature for nearly fifteen years. During the Civil War (1918), Manninen supported the legal government and was a member of the Civil Guards. On 10 February 1907, Manninen married Anni Swan, a noted author of fairy tales and children's books. They had three sons, Antero (1907–2000), Sulevi (1909–36), and Mauno (1915–1969). From the 1910s on, the Manninen family spent their summers on the island of Kotavuori in Puulavesi, where they built a house. In the serene environment of Kotavuori, Manninen spent most of his time writing poems and completing his translations. In 1939, he received the Hungarian PEN Club medal. Manninen died in Helsinki on 6 April 1950 after a short period of illness. In 1954, his statue by the sculptor Wäinö Aaltonen was installed in Mikkeli. Literary works Manninen's first anthology of poems Säkeitä I was published in 1905. A number of poems from this collection had already appeared in other anthologies. In this work, Manninen used his huge vocabulary of old written language, to archaisms and his own neologisms, which went unnoticed. The reviews considered it difficult due to its compressed expression. Manninen published his works at long intervals. In 1910, his second collection of poems, Säkeitä II was published. Again, it took another 15 years to finish his next work, Virrantyven (1925). Virrantyven mostly consists of the poems written on various anniversaries, translations, and patriotic poems written in the aftermath of the Civil War of 1918. Manninen's last collection of poems during his lifetime, Matkamies, was published in 1938. It included several poems, such as Nyt (now) and Kaukainen tie (distant road), which dealt with the loss of his son Sulevi. In these poems, Manninen described him as a guiding star, helping his father to accept his own fate. An anthology of his poems, Muistojen tie, was published posthumously from the poet's literary estate in 1951. Manninen translated a number of world classics into Finnish, including Sophocles's Oedipus Rex (1937), Euripides's Medeia (1949), Homer's Iliad (1919) and Odyssey (1924) and Goethe's Faust (second part 1934, first part 1936) and Hermann and Dorothea (1929). In his translations, Manninen tried to be faithful to the original. He translated a number of works of the Swedish-speaking national poet of Finland, Johan Ludvig Runeberg. He along with Juhani Aho, Paavo Cajander, Arvi Jännes, Eino Leino and Alpo Noponen translated Runeberg's Fänrik Ståls sägner (Vänrikki Stoolin tarinat in Finnish) in 1909. He translated also Runebarg's Hanna (1940), Kung Fjalar (1944) and Nadeschda (1948).

Transport to Magic Kingdom Magic Kingdom lies more than a mile away from its parking lot, on the opposite side of the man-made Seven Seas Lagoon. Upon arrival, guests are taken by the parking lot trams to the TTC, which sells tickets to the parks and provides transportation connections throughout the resort complex. It also has a small gift shop. To reach the park, guests use the Walt Disney World Monorail System, the Staten Island Ferry-style ferryboats, Disney Transport buses, or ridesharing company vehicles, depending on the location of their hotel or parking lot. All guests who are not staying at the resort's hotels must transfer from the parking lot trams to the monorail or the ferry system upon arrival at the TTC, while guests who park in the disability parking area can walk directly to the TTC from their car. However, guests who are staying at any of the resort's hotels have several options: * Guests staying at the three hotels closest to Magic Kingdom (Disney's Contemporary Resort, Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, and Disney's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa) can use either the ferry or the monorail system to travel to the Magic Kingdom. In addition, there is a walking path from the Contemporary Resort to the Magic Kingdom. * Guests staying at Disney's Wilderness Lodge and Disney's Fort Wilderness Campground can ride a dedicated ferry boat to the Magic Kingdom docks. * Guests staying at Shades of Green may take a walking path to the Polynesian Village Resort and use the aforementioned options, or take a bus to the TTC and transfer there. * Guests staying at the other hotels may take buses or rideshare vehicles to travel to the park; however, guests taking rideshare vehicles must transfer at the TTC or walk to the park from the Contemporary Resort, as rideshare vehicles cannot use the park's bus loops. The main monorail loop has two lanes. The outer lane is a direct nonstop loop between the TTC and Magic Kingdom (called the Express Line), while the inner loop has additional stops at Disney's Contemporary Resort, Disney's Polynesian Resort, and Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa (called the Resort Line).

While most urban lines in Lille were abandoned after 1950, the Mongy remained in service as the backbone of the public transport network of the TCC, the predecessor of Transpole. Whilst the expansion of the Metro initially threatened the trams, they were kept in service.Based on a translation of the article Transpole from the German Wikipedia. Retrieved on 2008-02-19. The lines originally terminated in the street outside the Opéra de Lille, but was diverted into a tunnel and underground terminus at the Gare de Lille Flandres, offering interchange with both lines of the Metro. The system was renovated between 1991 and 1994, and new low-floor trams were provided. The system is metre gauge electrified at 750 volts DC.

Originally a smaller natural water body, Shaw's Pond, it was dammed by New York City in 1870 and enlarged to for inclusion in its water supply system. It is classified as a controlled lake by the City system, and is part of its Croton Watershed. Geography The roughly heart-shaped lake is immediately to the southwest of downtown Carmel. It is surrounded by grassy parkland sloping down to the lake from the roads on the south and east, and woods on the other sides. NY 301 follows the north shore, ascending to its eastern terminus at NY 52 across from the Putnam County courthouse. Route 52 follows the eastern shore for a short distance to the south of this intersection before it, too, ends at US 6, which continues around the southern shore. There is no road along the western side, although a local street, Glenvue Drive, traverses the top of the -high ridge there. The lake fills a small depression in the middle of a hilly area. Its bottom continues its rapid drop from the shoreline, reaching a depth of slightly over in the middle of the lake, equivalent to the surface of a swampy depression to its east. Mean depth is . It typically contains , or of water. There are no inlet brooks. A dam and spillway are located on its northwest end, with outflow draining into the New York City water supply system's West Branch Reservoir, where it joins with waters from the Delaware Aqueduct. Water in excess of New York City's needs there goes over its spillway and into the West Branch Croton River, which is captured downstream by the Croton Falls Reservoir. History The hamlet of Carmel seen across Lake Glendeida from US Route 6 The lake was originally known as Shaw's Pond, after an early landowner. It had been a part of the Carmel landscape since the hamlet's designation as county seat upon Putnam's 1814 creation. It quickly became a popular spot for boating and fishing. The name started appearing on maps around 1840. Not long after, residents became dissatisfied with the name and proposed grander names for it. In 1852, a committee of local residents finally settled on Lake Gleneida. New York City bought rights to the lake around 1895 and tore down what houses were built near it. Recreation The New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) owns Lake Gleneida, considered one of three controlled lakes in the city's water system. That means it may withdraw water as a right of ownership.New York State Department of Health Regulations, Part 128-1.6(a)(20)Rules and Regulations for the Protection from Contamination, Degradation and Pollution of the New York City Water Supply and its Sources, Final Regulations, Chapter 18 - New York City, Subchapter A, Section 18-16 - Definitions (20) \\"Controlled lake means a lake from which the City may withdraw water pursuant to rights acquired by the City or as a right of ownership. The controlled lakes are: Kirk Lake, Lake Gleneida and Lake Gilead\\". Lake Gleneida in winter Recreational use of the lake falls under DEP regulations. Fishing, ice fishing and boating are allowed with a valid DEP permit and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation-issued fishing license. Swimming is not permitted. Boats used in the lake may not be used in any other body of water, to prevent the spread of zebra mussels. This raised some local concern in 2005, since many were left on shore during the offseason and the town found them unsightly as it prepared to spend $2.3 million to spruce up the hamlet. DEP was able to get most of the owners to relocate them to storage areas out of sight of downtown.

The building is located a short walk from the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, just north of Franklin Avenue and west of Highland. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 based on its architecture. Designed by local architect Frank Webster in 1929, the building's owner was Sidney Ullman, Rudolph Valentino's business manager and agent. Like many in the industry, Ullman used his profits to invest in real estate. This tremendous source of capital enabled Hollywood buildings to exercise their creativity without regard to cost, as each builder tried to outdo the others. Local architect Frank Webster designed this building, which was built at a cost of $75,000 in May 1929. Villa Bonita is a seven-story residential apartment building exhibiting character-defining features of the Spanish Colonial Revival style. Alterations include the addition of a penthouse and a metal roof sign in the early 1930s and addition of a sunroom in 1989. The quality of detailing throughout the structure is remarkable for a building of its size, making it a prime representative example of multi-unit housing in Hollywood during its prime period of significance. The seven-floor building was originally built for the cast and crew of director Cecil B. DeMille. Since then, it has housed the likes of Errol Flynn and Francis Ford Coppola.Liesl Bradner (August 18, 2016), Inside Villa Bonita, the Hollywood building that Errol Flynn, Francis Ford Coppola and others called home Los Angeles Times. Although Villa Bonita residents held a variety of jobs, tenants of the building, particularly in the 1930s and 1940s, tended to be employed in the local entertainment industry as artists, singers, musicians, film corporation executives, etc. For example, Ethelind Terry is recorded in the 1939 Los Angeles City Directory as residing in the Villa Bonita. She was an opera and musical comedy actress starring in several productions, including “Sons O’ Guns” at the Carthay Circle Theater in Los Angeles in 1932, and “Rio Rita” on Broadway in New York City.The proximity of Villa Bonita to Hollywood’s core commercial and entertainment district made 1817 Hillcrest Road a desirable address for those working in the local industry. Architect Frank Webster embraced the turn-of-the-20th century period revival style architecture trend with his design for Villa Bonita. Webster lived and worked in the Los Angeles area, completing designs for a variety of buildings in southern California, including a two-story multifamily residential building located at 2601-11 Beachwood Drive in Hollywood (c. 1926), a three-story hotel in Topanga Canyon (c. 1925), several buildings in Santa Monica, and a five- story hotel and apartment building in San Diego (c. 1925). Due to the lack of scholarship regarding his work, it is difficult both to assess the extent of Webster’s architectural impact on southern California and whether or not the buildings identified above are extant. The Villa Bonita, however, appears to be among his significant work The building has a small lobby with marble floor, ornate moldings and brackets, and original chandelier. Metal mailboxes occupy a portion of the north wall. An original panel1 ed elevator and a central stairway provide access to the upper floors. The building is bisected by an east-west hallway. Each of the twenty- four apartments contain dining area, kitchens with breakfast nooks, and baths. Interiors are largely intact, featuring casement windows, entry has , original cabinetry, and hardware. A low wall surmounted by an ornamental iron fence encloses a small landscaped courtyard at the front of the building. No other features are present within the boundaries .

The cross was subsequently moved to Cong Abbey at Cong, County Mayo, from which it takes its name. It was designed to be placed on top of a staff and is also a reliquary, designed to hold a purported piece of the True Cross. This gave it additional importance as an object of reverence and was undoubtedly the reason for the object's elaborate beauty. The cross is displayed at the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin, having previously been in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin. It is considered one of finest examples of metalwork and decorative art of its period in Western Europe. Description Detail from Notes on the Cross of Cong The Cross of Cong consists of an oak cross, covered in gold, silver, niello, copper, bronze, brass, enamel, coloured glass, and other ornamentation. In addition to traditional Irish design features from Insular art, the cross also displays some Viking and Romanesque influences, including 'strapwork' decoration in the Urnes style. It has been suggested that the older Insular stylistic elements may be deliberate revivalism. The decoration includes minute golden filigree work in an intertwined pattern called on front and back. From the base heads of beasts on each side grip the cross in their mouth, a feature also found in German crosses. The overall shape of the cross was thought to be Romanesque, but recent discoveries have shown very similar shapes in much earlier Irish pieces. Some of the original precious stones and glass pieces that studded the cross are now missing. There is a large polished piece of rock crystal in the centre of the cross. Under this was placed the relic (sent from Rome around the year A.D. 1123) of what at the time was believed to be the True Cross. The relic is since lost, and was a small fragment of wood only. The crystal is semi-transparent, once enabling the relic to be partially seen by the viewer. The cross is high and the arms are in breadth. As a processional cross, the cross was carried mounted on its staff at the head of a religious procession by one of the officiating clergy or altar-servers. Often such crosses were then removed from their staff and placed on the altar during the ceremony. The reincarnation of centuries-old Irish metalworking techniques, such as the juxtaposition of red and yellow enamel, is seen on the and Manchan shrine. History According to Irish annals, supported by the inscriptions on the cross itself (which refer to known historical personages), the cross was made in County Roscommon. In the annals, the cross is sometimes called in the Irish language \\"an Bacall Buidhe\\", which translates as \\"the yellow staff\\" — a reference to its golden colour. Ruins of Cong Abbey, County Mayo. The cross was commissioned by King Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair. In A.D. 1123, according to the Irish annals, a small piece of the purported True Cross arrived in Ireland and was enshrined at Roscommon.The Annals of Tigernach note the arrival of \\"Christ's Cross,\\" from which Toirdhealbhach Ó Conchobhair requested a piece. Historians, however, almost universally dismiss such claims that pieces of the True Cross were ever found. Most Medieval relics are considered not to be genuine, though many Medieval chroniclers doubtless considered them to be so. The cross then appears to have moved to Tuam. At an early date, probably in the mid-12th century, the cross was moved from Tuam to Cong Abbey, an abbey founded by the Augustinians on a much earlier Christian site. In later centuries, the exact location of the cross in the Cong area is uncertain but it appears to have been hidden by locals and ecclesiastics in their homes because of religious persecution against Catholics, which reached its peak in Ireland under the penal laws. In 1680, Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh, the historian from County Galway, saw the cross (which he referred to as the \\"Abbot of Cong's Cross\\") and copied inscriptions from it. Edward Lhuyd of Wales, mistakenly calls him Humphrey Lloyd and incorrectly gives the publication date as 1709. Petrie stated that he thought that the cross must have been seen by Lloyd (meaning Lhuyd) on a tour he made of Connacht at the beginning of the 18th century. However, it appears that it was Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh who supplied Lhuyd with the details for his book by sending him copies of his own notes that he had made in 1680. Ó Flaithbheartaigh's friend, recorded this fact in his \\"Archaeologia Britannica\\", published in 1707. James MacCullagh (1809–1847). In the 19th century, George Petrie, the Irish antiquarian, was aware that Lhuyd's book mentioned the cross, though he partly misinterpreted the details. In 1822, Petrie had seen the cross himself when he passed through Cong on a tour he made of Connacht. Petrie told his friend, Professor James MacCullagh (of Trinity College, Dublin), about the cross and of its historical value. MacCullagh, using his own money, though not a rich man, afterwards purchased the cross from the Parish Priest of Cong – Fr. Michael Waldron.He paid 100 guineas for it. Fr. Waldron had succeeded Fr. Patrick Prendergast as Parish Priest of Cong, when Fr. Prendergast died in 1829, and discovered the cross amongst his belongings. Fr. Patrick Prendergast, an Augustinian, was also considered to be the last Abbot of Cong Abbey. Fr. Prendergast had discovered the cross hidden in an old oak chest kept in a house in the village, where it was said to have been kept since about the mid-17th century (the time of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland). Fr. Prendergast then kept the cross in his house, named 'Abbotstown', located on a farm in the townland of Ballymagibbon (or Ballymacgibbon), which is close to Cong. William Wilde, who was from this part of Ireland, had seen the cross in his childhood in Fr. Prendergast's possession and stated that at that time (the early 19th century) the cross was used at Cong chapel at the festivals of Christmas and Easter, when it was placed on the altar during mass. MacCullagh presented the cross in 1839 to the Royal Irish Academy, where it was for a long period one of its most treasured artefacts. About 1890, the cross was transferred to the newly opened National Museum of Science and Art, Dublin, which was the predecessor of the National Museum of Ireland, and remained in the same building when the National Museum of Ireland was founded in 1925. Today, the cross remains in the National Museum of Ireland, although it was on display in the National Museum of Ireland – Country Life, Turlough Park, Castlebar, from 31 March 2010 for one year, while the Dublin museum was being renovated. This was the first time the cross had left Dublin since the 1830s. Inscriptions The cross has inscriptions on it, — all of which are in the Irish language, with the exception of one which is in Latin. Latin The Latin inscription occurs twice – once on each side of the shaft – in one case the letters of the sixth word are PAHUS, and in the other, PASUS; it should read PASSUS. A facsimile engraving (taken from a rubbing) of one of these inscriptions is shown below, 300px In modern Latin this is rendered as > \\"Hāc cruce crux tegitur quā pas[s]us conditor orbis\\", which has been translated as > \\"With this cross is covered the cross on which suffered the Maker of the > World.\\" or, with similar meaning, as > \\"In this cross is preserved [or conserved] the cross on which the Founder of > the world suffered.\\" Irish Replica in the Ulster Museum In addition, the translated Irish language inscriptions read as follows: > A prayer for Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair, for the King of Ireland, for whom > this shrine was made. > Pray for Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh, the Senior of Erin. > Pray for Domnall mac Flannacáin Ua Dubthaig, Bishop of Connacht and Comarb > [Successor] of [Saints] Comman and Ciaran, under whose superintendence the > shrine was made. > Pray for Mael Isu mac Bratdan O Echan, who made this shrine. Creation The technical and stylistic similarities to the \\"Cross of Cong group\\", confirms without doubt the Cross of Cong was crafted at the \\"well- defined\\" and \\"original\\" fine-metal workshop active in twelfth century county Roscommon. The cross was likely commissioned by Bishop \\"Domnall mac Flannacain Ui Dubthaig\\", of Elphin, one of the richest episcopal see's in Medieval Ireland, and created by the master gold-craftsman named (\\"Mailisa MacEgan\\"), whom O'Donovan says was Abbot of Cloncraff, in county Roscommon, though firm evidence for this identification is lacking. The founder and patron Saint of this workshop, might have been St. Assicus of Elphin. Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair was patron of the relic, though perhaps monasteries rather than dioceses commissioned metal reliquaries.
