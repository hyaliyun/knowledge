Phylogenetic analysis of their plesiomorphic morphology suggested that Williella species are members of a group of isolated and generalized moths from Australia, New Zealand and South America. The discovery of the genus in New Caledonia suggested that these plesiomorphic modern Tortricinae are isolated descendants of a group of very generalized Tortricinae that were distributed throughout the Gondwana supercontinent before it broke up into many of the main modern landmasses of the Southern Hemisphere.

He played for the University of Michigan from 1945 to 1947 under head coach Fritz Crisler. In ten years as the head football coach at Ann Arbor Pioneer High School (1949-1958), he compiled a record of 69-6-4\\\\. He subsequently served as an assistant football coach at the University of Michigan under head coach Bump Elliott from 1959-1968\\\\. Player Fonde was a native of Knoxville, Tennessee. He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1944 as part of the V-12 Navy College Training Program. He played for Fritz Crisler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1945 to 1947. In his first year playing for the Wolverines, Fonde scored Michigan's only touchdown in a 7-3 victory over Ohio State in 1945. In 1947, Fonde played for Crisler's undefeated 1947 team, considered by some the greatest Michigan football team of all time. After an undefeated, untied regular season, the 1947 Wolverines defeated the University of Southern California 49 to 0 in the 1948 Rose Bowl. The 1948 Rose Bowl was Fonde's final game as a player for the Wolverines, and he capped his collegiate career by throwing the only forward pass he ever threw in a game‚Äîresulting in a 45-yard touchdown completion to Gene Derricotte. Michigan coach Bennie Oosterbaan later said of Fonde, who was five feet, seven inches, and 155 pounds, that he was \\"the best back, pound for pound, I've ever had.\\" In August 1948, Fonde was drafted by coach Frank Leahy to play in the Chicago College All-Star Game. Coaching career Fonde began a coaching career in 1948 as the head football coach at University High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His 1948 team won six of eight games. In February 1949, Fonde was hired as the head football coach at Ann Arbor High School (renamed Ann Arbor Pioneer High School during his tenure as head coach). In his first eight seasons as the school's head coach, he compiled a record of 59‚Äì2‚Äì2 and developed a reputation as one of the best coaches in the state. He remained head coach at Pioneer through the 1958 season. During his tenure, Fonde's teams had seven undefeated seasons, had a 40-game winning streak, and compiled an overall record of 69‚Äì6‚Äì4. While coaching at Ann Arbor High, Fonde also received a master's degree in education from the University of Michigan in 1956. In January 1959, Fonde was hired as the backfield coach for the University of Michigan football team under head coach Bump Elliott. Fonde was an assistant coach at Michigan for 10 years from 1959 to 1968. In 1968, Elliott expanded Fonde's responsibility, giving him \\"command of the overall defense, while specializing with the defensive backs.\\" During his 10 years at Michigan, he was the position coach for Michigan's backs, including Bennie McRae, Dennis Fitzgerald, Dave Raimey, Mel Anthony, Carl Ward, Bob Timberlake, Jim Detwiler, and Tom Curtis. Fonde was not retained on the coaching staff when Bo Schembechler took over as head coach. In January 1969, Fonde was given a new position as director of academic counseling and recruiting coordinator. He resigned in June 1970 to accept a position with an Ann Arbor insurance firm. Family and later years Fonde was married in April 1948 to Edith Jensen at the First Presbyterian Church in Ann Arbor. Teammate Howard Yerges was his best man. Fonde later owned and operated the Stretch & Sew Fabric Store in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Fonde died in 2009 at age 85 of complications brought on by Alzheimer's disease.

It traced its history from the highly decorated 3rd Guards Rifle Division of World War II. 3rd Guards Rifle Division was formed from the 153rd Rifle Division. Division history=Combat history from June 22 to September 20, 1941 In August 1940, by an Order of the People's Commissar of Defense of the USSR, the 153rd Rifle Division was formed in the city of Sverdlovsk. The division was later renamed the 3rd Guard Rifle Volnovakha Red Banner Suvorov Division. From August 1940 through June 1941 the division was engaged in combat training in the Kamyshlovsky camps of the Ural Military District. In the first half of June 1941, by the order of the People's Commissar of Defense of the USSR, the division, as a part of the Second Strategic Echelon, was transferred to Vitebsk. By June 22, 1941‚Äîthe day of the German attack on the Soviet Union‚Äîthe first three echelons (troop trains?) had already arrived to Vitebsk. The full complement of the division arrived to Vitebsk only by June 27, 1941. Upon arriving to Vitebsk, the division was manned to peacetime standards (6,000 soldiers and officers). Due to the declaration of war, the division was urgently staffed with personnel and supplied with additional weapons and materiel over the period of June 22‚Äì27. The mobilized personnel arriving to the division's camps were often under- supplied, but over the course of the week the division became fairly battle- ready. While the staffing of the division was still in progress, on June 26, 1941, parts of it assumed a defensive position on a broad front along the Gnezdilovichi‚ÄìKholm‚Äìsovkhoz Khodtsy‚ÄìMoshkany‚ÄìBurdeli‚Äìstation of Krynki line. At the same time, the division's advance detachments reached the area of Ulla-2 (435th Rifle Regiment), Beshankovichy (Reconnaissance Battalion), Verkhovye (666th Rifle Regiment), and Syanno (505th Rifle Regiment). On July 5, 1941, the advance units along these lines clashed with large mechanized forces of the enemy which were breaking through to Vitebsk. On July 7, 1941, the battle reached the main division lines in the areas of Gnezdilovichi, Shchikotovshchina, Pavlovichi, and sovkhoz Khodtsy. Large German motorized and tank forces, expanding their offensive, attempted to break through to the city of Vitebsk along the Beshenkovichi-Vitebsk highway, and on July 7, 1941, reached the defense division line. After the day of fierce fighting, the division stopped the enemy's advance to the city along the highway and inflicted heavy losses. The German units, waging battles with the defending divisional forces, launched another offensive towards Vitebsk both along the Polotsk‚ÄìVitebsk and the Syanno‚ÄîBogushevsk highways, thus bypassing the division from north and south. On July 8, 1941, due to the emerging threat of the entrapment by the enemy, the division partially re-grouped its forces, and took up defensive positions at the Gnezdilovichi‚ÄìKholm‚Äìsovkhoz Khodtsy‚ÄìMoshkany‚ÄìShchemilovka line. The battles were extremely fierce. The Germans repeatedly tried to break through the division's defensive line, but after having achieved no success and sustaining heavy losses in men and materiel, ceased their attempts at the head-on attack. After breaking through the defenses on the right and left, a large force of infantry and tanks began to bypass the division from the north and south. Continuing the offensive north and south of the defending division, by the end of July 10, 1941, the German forces broke through the Gorodok‚ÄìVitebsk and Polotsk‚ÄìVitebsk highways and captured the western part of Vitebsk, thus reaching the western coast of the Zapadnaya Dvina River. The German mechanized troops pushed past the division's flanks and launched an offensive towards Smolensk. From July 11, 1941, the division was surrounded near the villages of Popovka, Karpovichi, and Krynki, located respectively 8, 14, and 22 km south-east of Vitebsk. By the morning of July 17, 1941, the division's main forces reached the area of Sleptsy, Loguny, and Karoli, located respectively 17, 14 and 18 km south-west of a major inhabited locality of Liozno (Vitebsk Oblast). Until the end of August 5, 1941, the 153rd Infantry Division was trying to break out of the encirclement. By August, of its original complement of 6,000 only about 1,000 soldiers and officers remained. From August 6 to 22, 1941, the division conducted combat operations on the east bank of the Dnieper River, as well as attempted to expand its foothold on the west coast in the area of Ratchino, Lyakhovo, and Golovino. From August 22 to September 6, 1941, the division conducted warfare in the area of Height 249.9 on the east bank of the Dnieper, and then on the west coast. From September 6 to 20, 1941, the division was in the 20th Army reserve and then in the Stavka Supreme Main Command reserve while it was staffed to standard in Kalinin. On September 18, 1941, by the Order #308 of the People's Commissar of Defense, the 153rd Rifle Division was renamed the 3rd Guards Rifle Division. Fighting divisions from 20 September 1941 to the summer of 1943 From September 20 to November 9, 1941, the division led military operations as a part of the 54th Army of the Leningrad Front in the area of Mga and Sinyavino. From November 10 to 14, 1941, the division relocated to the left flank of the army, south of the city of Volkhov. From November 15 to December 28, 1941, the division conducted combat operations near Volkhov and then pursued the enemy to the station of Pogostye. In summer 1942, the division added staff, and then was made a part of the Stavka reserve. At the end of August - September 1942, the division took part in the Sinyavino Offensive of the Volkhov Front. In early December 1942, the division was withdrawn from the Stavka reserve and transferred under the 2nd Guards Army of the Stalingrad Front. During winter 1942, the division completed a difficult forced march, passing 200 to 280 km from the discharge point to the assembly areas. From December 15 to 31, 1942, the division engaged in active combat operations near Stalingrad. During the Stalingrad strategic offensive, on the threshold of the Myshkova River, the division, as a part of the 2nd Guards Army, played a decisive role in repelling the enemy's Kotelnikovo group attack, and on December 24 it started the offensive itself and forced the enemy to withdraw to the south. Continuing the offensive toward Rostov, the troops of the 2nd Guards Army liberated Novocherkassk on February 13, 1943, and three days later reached the Mius River, where the enemy's resistance forced them to take defensive positions. Fighting from the summer of 1943 to May 1945 In August‚ÄìSeptember 1943, the 3rd Guards Division took part in the Donbass strategic offensive operation. The division liberated the inhabited localities of Bolshoy Tokmak (on September 20, 1943) and Volnovakha (on September 10, 1943). By the order of VGK, the 3rd Guards Rifle Division (as well as 11th Guards Cavalry Division, 5th Motor Rifle Division, and 12th Motor Rifle Division, 5th and 12th Guards Motorized Brigades, 5th and 6th Guards Motorized Brigades, and 65th Tank Brigade) was named \\"Volnovakha\\". In late September, during the Melitopol Offensive, the divisional forces reached the lower course of the Dnieper and liberated Kakhovka on the coast of the Black Sea (on 2 November 1943). In December, as a part of the 4th Ukrainian Front, the divisional forces eliminated the enemy's foothold on the left bank of the Dnieper (in the area of Kherson) after a stubborn battle. In February 1944, the army was transferred to the area of Perekop isthmus, and in April‚ÄìMay it took part in the Crimean strategic operation, resulting in the liberation of Yevpatoriya on April 13, 1944, and, together with other forces of the 4th Ukrainian Front and the Black Sea Fleet, Sevastopol on May 9. In May‚ÄìJune, the 2nd Guards Army was relocated to the area of cities of Dorogobuzh and Yelnya. From May 20, it was in the Stavka reserve, and on July 8 it was included in the 1st Baltic Front. In July, during the ≈†iauliai Offensive, the division countered the enemy's strikes to the west and northwest of ≈†iauliai. In October, it participated in the Memel Offensive. On December 20, it was reassigned to the 3rd Belorussian Front. In January‚ÄìApril 1945, during the East Prussian Offensive, it broke the long-term defenses and eliminated, in conjunction with other troops, encircled German forces southwest of Koenigsberg and the Sambia group. Postwar The 3rd Guards Rifle Division was in the Voronezh Military District with 11th Guards Rifle Corps in 1945-6, and later in 1955 and 1957. Feskov 2014/Holm say the division became 3rd Guards Motor Rifle Division on 25 June 1957 at Klaipƒóda.Feskov et al. 2013, p.150, and Michael Holm, 3rd Guards Motorised Rifle Division, 2015. In the 1980s, the division became the 3rd Guards Motor Rifle Division for Coastal Defence on 12 October 1989 and transferred to the Baltic Fleet. Prior to that time it had been subordinated to the Baltic Military District. On 1 September 1993 the division was disbanded.

Upon translation, the NatA binds to the ribosome and then \\"stretches\\" to the front end of the forming, or nascent, polypeptide, where it adds this acetyl group. This acetyl group is added to the front end, or N-terminus of the new protein. Forty percent of all proteins in the yeast proteome are thought to be N-terminally acetylated, with a corresponding figure of 90% in mammalian proteins.Caesar, Robert, Jonas Warringer, and Anders Blomberg. \\"Physiological Importance and Identification of Novel Targets for the N-Terminal Acetyltransferase NatB ‚Äì Caesar et al. 5 (2): 368 --.\\" Eukaryotic Cell. 16 December 2005.

Sup35p acetylation In Saccharomyces cerevisiae NatA acetyltransferase interacts with the Sup35p protein. It is involved in the reaction of the [PSI+], converting the [psi-] to its own conformation. Thus, [PSI+] strains deficient in NatA Acetyltransferase have been found to have an altered interaction between Sup35p[PSI+] and nascent Sup35p. This interaction at the post-translational level still produces a prion with classical beta sheets, but this version of the interaction does not take away the function of this third release factor. Thus, stop codons are translated reliably in [PSI+] strains lacking NatA Acetyltransferase.\\"The NatA Acetyltransferase Couples Sup35 Prion Complexes to the [PSI ] Phenotype ‚Äì Pezza et al. 20 (3): 1068‚Äì .\\" Molecular Biology of the Cell.

Morgan was mentioned as a potential successor to Secretary of State Jon Husted, once Husted vacated his seat in the Ohio Senate. However, the seat went to Peggy Lehner. Morgan went to the Ohio Supreme Court to get school- funding records from the administration of Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, who turned over thousands of pages of documents. Nothing of substance was done with these documents. On May 16, 2011, Ohio Governor John Kasich named Morgan as a member of the Ohio Retirement Study Council.

Carol Victor, Hereditary Prince of Albania (Karl Viktor Wilhelm Friedrich Ernst G√ºnther von Wied, 19 May 19138 December 1973) was the only son of William, Prince of Albania and briefly heir to the Principality of Albania. He held the title of Hereditary Prince of Albania. He was also styled Sk√´nder, in homage to Skanderbeg, the national hero. Early life Carol Victor was born on 19 May 1913 in Potsdam, Kingdom of Prussia as Prince Charles Victor of Wied (). He was the second child and only son of Prince William Frederick of Wied (1876‚Äì1945), son of William, Prince of Wied and Princess Marie of the Netherlands, and his wife, Princess Sophie of Sch√∂nburg-Waldenburg (1885‚Äì1936), daughter of Victor, Hereditary Prince of Sch√∂nburg-Waldenburg and his wife Princess Lucia of Sayn-Wittgenstein- Berleburg. Through his paternal grandmother he was related with the Dutch Royal Family. His great-grandparents were King William I of the Netherlands and King Frederick William III of Prussia. He had some remote Albanian ancestry through his mother, being a descendant of Ruxandra Ghica, daughter of Grigore I Ghica, Prince of Wallachia.http://www.ghika.net/Histoire/Question_Orient.pdf The Ghica family was a Greek Orthodox Phanariote dynasty of Albanian origin Carol Victor first attended the Wilhelmsgymnasium in Munich, after that studied law at T√ºbingen, Munich, K√∂nigsberg and W√ºrzburg universities. His doctoral thesis on criminal procedure was published in Stuttgart in 1936 (Die alternative Feststellung im Strafrecht; W√ºrzburger Abhandlungen zum deutschen und ausl√§ndischen Prozessrecht, Heft 30, Kohlhammer Verlag, 1936). He was a keen swordsman and enjoyed skiing. In 1937, Swire described him as a young man of great ability, with his father's good nature (Swire, Zog's Albania, page 202). Hereditary Prince of Albania On 7 March 1914, appointed by the Great Powers of Europe, his father William was created Prince of Albania. After his father became Prince, he held the title of Hereditary Prince of Albania. With Albania in a state of civil war since July 1914, Greece occupying the south of the country, the great powers at war with one another, the regime collapsed, and so all of his family left the country on 3 September 1914 originally heading to Venice. Despite leaving Albania his father insisted that he remained head of state. In the spring of 1924, the Albanian parliament debated the form of government and Milto Tutulani, a senator, appointed Prince William, his son Carol Victor or a Briton as a monarch (Milto Tutulani, Raporti i grupit monarkist t√´ komisionit t√´ statutit, Tiran√´, 1924 in Michael Schmidt-Neke, Entstehung und Ausbau der K√∂nigsdiktatur in Albanien: 1912 - 1939, page 140). During the Second World War, Carol Victor served as an officer in the German army in Romania, and in the autumn of 1941 there was speculation that the Germans, who had occupied Kingdom of Serbia, including the Kosovo with Albanian majority, would use him to rally Albanians to the German cause. This worried Mussolini's Foreign Minister, Count Ciano, to such extent that in November 1941, he accused the Germans of aiming to construct a new Albanian state led by Prince Carol Victor, which would be anti-Italian and whose militia would take oath directly to Hitler. There appeared to be little truth to Ciano's fears, and the Germans reassured him they had no such ambition for the prince (Fischer, Albania at War, 1939 - 1945, page 86). At the time of second/third Battle of Cassino he belonged to the 44th Infantry Division (Manfred Schick, Monte Cassino: Ein R√ºckblick nach 60 Jahren). On the death of his father, on 18 April 1945 at Predeal, near Sinaia, in Romania, he succeeded as Head of the Princely House of Albania (Wied) and Sovereign Grand Master of the Order of the Black Eagle although he made no public claim to the throne of Albania. Less than a year his father's death, both his uncles William Frederick (6. F√ºrst zu Wied) and Victor, former German ambassador to Sweden (1933 -1943) died. Also in 1945, his uncle G√ºnther (5. F√ºrst von Sch√∂nburg-Waldenburg), Sophie's brother, was expropriated without compensation and interned at R√ºgen island (S√§chsische Biografie). His sister, Princess Marie Eleonore of Albania (Princesha e Shqip√´ris√´) died in a communist internment camp at Miercurea Ciuc, Romania, on 29 September 1956, without issue. In 1952, Carol Victor wrote a bibliographical survey of his ancestor the German explorer, ethnologist and naturalist Maximilian of Wied (Proceedings of the 30th International Congress of Americanists, held at Cambridge, pages 193 - 194). Later he wrote \\"Maximilian Prinz zu Wied, sein Leben und seine Reisen\\" in Maximilian Prinz zu Wied, unver√∂ffentliche Bilder und Handschriften zur V√∂lkerkunde Brasiliens, Josef R√∂der and Hermann Trimborn (editors), Bonn, Ferdinand D√ºmmler, 1954), pages 13 ‚Äì 25. In 1960, Carol Victor left the Munich society \\"Freunde des Balletts\\", of which he was president since its foundation in 1956 (Der Spiegel 19/1960). The following year he published the book: \\"K√∂niginnen des Balletts: Zweihundert Jahre europ√§isches Ballett\\". Marriage On 8 September 1966, whilst living in New York City, Carol Victor married the English-born widow Eileen de Coppet (n√©e Johnston), whose first husband had been Captain Andr√© de Coppet (1892 - 1953). They had no children; de Coppet was in her forties when the marriage occurred. Carol Victor and Eileen lived later in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London. Carol Victor died seven years later without issue in Munich.Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, editor, Burke's Royal Families of the World, Volume 1: Europe & Latin America (London, U.K.: Burke's Peerage Ltd, 1977), page 6.

She was launched in 1804, during the Napoleonic Wars. She played a major role in the Battle of the Basque Roads. Beagle was laid up in ordinary in 1813 and sold in 1814. Career Beagle was commissioned in August 1804 under Commander John Burn, who sailed her to the Mediterranean. On 5 December Burn and Beagle captured the Spanish ship Fuenta Hermosa. Burn was temporarily relieved by Commander George Digby between June and August 1805, after which she joined Sir John Orde‚Äôs squadron off Cadiz. On 14 January 1805, Beagle captured the Spanish ship Pastora Hermosa, which was carrying bullion. Commander Francis Newcombe left the hired armed ship Lord Eldon to replace Burn in February 1806; Beagle remained in the Mediterranean until 1807. On 27 April 1806, Beagle and a number of other vessels were in company with Termagant when Termagant captured Anna Maria Carolina. Beagle then moved to the Downs where she operated between 1808 and 1809. While under Newcombe's command Beagle captured three privateers in the English Channel. She captured Hazard, of 14 guns and 49 men, on 2 October 1808, Vengeur, of 16 guns and 48 men, on 24 January 1809, and Fortune, of 14 guns and 58 men, on 18 February. *Hazard, which was under the command of Joseph Marie Lelong, had one man badly wounded before Beagle was able to capture her after a three-hour chase. Hazard had left Dieppe the day before and had captured two light colliers (the Trinity Yacht and Assistance), but Newcombe was unable to find and recapture them.The European Magazine, 1808, p.395. Hazard had been Matthew, of Sunderland, and was carrying a cargo of coals. *Vengeur was in company with Grand Napoleon, which escaped. Vengeur herself did not surrender until Beagle came alongside, though her captain, M. Bourgnie, was wounded. Vengeur had made no captures.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 21, p.164. *Fortune, under Captain Tucker, had one man badly wounded. She was out of Calais and had made no captures.'\\"The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 79, Part 1, p.263. Participation at the Battle of the Basque Roads Beagle arrived at Basque Roads on 10 April, having escorted from the Downs the convoy of fireships that were to attack the French anchorage the next day.Cordingly, pg. 184 Beagle was the second ship (after the bomb vessel ) to voluntarily arrive to aid Cochrane's Imperieuse after the successful fireship attack, her crew reportedly giving Cochrane three cheers upon arriving. The prize crew that took possession and later burnt the French ship-of-the-line , was under the command of a lieutenant from Beagle and a midshipman from Imperieuse. Beagle also took part in the bombardment of the French ships Aquilon and Ville de Varsovie, skilfully manoeuvring to fire, unlike other British ships that were anchoring to engage.Cordingly, pg. 197-200 Beagle was one of the few ships joining Cochrane in ignoring Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford's recall order. Cochrane tasked her with protecting Aetna during the move upriver. Newcombe therefore placed Beagle between Aetna and the grounded French battleships. As a result, Beagle took heavy damage to her rigging and expended nearly all of her powder. Beagle had one man wounded. Newcombe's achievements and valour resulted in his receiving promotion to post-captain after the battle.Cordingly, pg. 208 In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the then-surviving participants in the battle the Naval General Service Medal with the clasp \\"Basque Roads 1809\\". Two of Beagles sister ships, and were also present at the Basque Roads. Later years Later in 1809 Commander William Dolling took command of Beagle, following Newcombe's promotion. In July and August, Beagle took part in the Scheldt operations. On 4 November Beagle and recaptured Mount Royal, of Pool. On 8 February 1810 Beagle recaptured the brig Resource. Then on 10 October Dollin and Beagle captured the smuggling lugger Ox, for which they received a reward from the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs. Then on 13 June Beagle captured the smuggling boat Fly, of Bexhill. Three days later she captured several smuggling galleys. Apparently the officers and crew of Beagle purchased the cargo of two of the galleys and sold it. Commander John Smith took command of Beagle in August 1811. On 14 August 1813, Beagle, in company with , the gun-brig , and the schooner , captured Marmion. Beagle, Juniper, and participated in the Siege of San Sebasti√°n (7 July - 8 September 1813) as part of the fleet under Captain George Collier assigned to help Sir Arthur Wellesley's campaigns in Portugal and Spain. Beagle had one man dangerously wounded in the taking of the battery on Santa Clara Island. Later, the seamen from the squadron, under Smith's command, maneuvered 24-pounder guns from Surveillante up the steep scarp of Saint Clara Island to assemble their own battery facing San Sebastian, which allowed them to silence the guns there. Smith was slightly wounded while being in charge of the seamen on shore engaged in taking the French battery on Saint Clara Island and in the subsequent operations. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General service Medal with clasp \\"St. Sebastian\\" to surviving participants in the campaign. On 30 November Beagle was in company with when Rover captured the American brig Empress. Fate Beagle was laid up in ordinary at Plymouth in 1813.

He is known as the semiconductor industry founder of Taiwan. Biography Chang was born in Ningbo, Chekiang. When he was young, he wanted to become a novelist or journalist.Tekla S. Perry, Morris Chang: Foundry Father, IEEE Spectrum, https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/tech-careers/morris-chang-foundry- father However, his father, an official in the Yin county government, persuaded him otherwise. In 1948, as China was in the height of the Chinese Civil War, a year before People‚Äôs Republic of China established, Chang moved to Hong Kong. The very next year he moved yet again to the United States to attend Harvard University. He transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in sophomore year and received his bachelor's and master's degrees in mechanical engineering from MIT in 1952 and 1953, respectively. After leaving MIT without obtaining a PhD, he was hired by Sylvania Semiconductor, then just known as a small semiconductor division of Sylvania Electric Products, in 1955.Perry, supra n. 1 Three years later, he moved to Texas Instruments in 1958, which was then rapidly rising in its field. After three years at TI, he rose to manager of the engineering section of the company. It was then, in 1961, that TI decided to invest in him by giving him the opportunity to obtain his PhD degree, which he received in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1964. During his 25-year career (1958‚Äì1983) at Texas Instruments, he rose up in the ranks to become the group vice president responsible for TI's worldwide semiconductor business. He left TI and later become president and chief operating officer of General Instrument Corporation (1984‚Äì1985). Chang worked on a four-transistor project for TI where the manufacturing was done by IBM. This was one of the early semiconductor foundry relationships. Also at TI, Morris pioneered the then controversial idea of pricing semiconductors ahead of the cost curve, or sacrificing early profits to gain market share and achieve manufacturing yields that would result in greater long-term profits. After he left General Instrument Corporation, Sun Yun-suan recruited him to become chairman and president of the Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan. As head of a government-sponsored non-profit, he was in charge of promoting industrial and technological development in Taiwan. Chang founded TSMC in 1987, the beginning of the period where firms increasingly saw value in outsourcing their manufacturing capabilities to Asia. Soon, TSMC became one of the world's most profitable chip makers. Chang left ITRI in 1994 and became chairman of Vanguard International Semiconductor Corporation from 1994 to 2003 while continuing to serve as chairman of TSMC. In 2005, he handed TSMC's CEO position to Rick Tsai. In June 2009, Chang returned to the position of TSMC's CEO once again. On June 5, 2018, Chang announced his retirement, succeeded by C.C. Wei as CEO and Mark Liu as chairman. Chang was awarded the Order of Propitious Clouds, First Class in September 2018. In 2018, Chang was appointed as the Presidential Envoy of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to APEC. This is his second time serving, the first time being in 2006.

The poll was one of the first college-based public opinion polls in the United States. MIPO regularly measures public opinion, both in New York State and across the country. The Marist Poll is highly respected, and is often cited by journalists and pundits around the world. History MIPO was founded in 1978 by Dr. Lee Miringoff, former President of the National Council of Public Polls, as a poll on Dutchess County elections for a political science class he was teaching on voting behavior. MIPO was reportedly the first college-based survey center in the nation to involve undergraduates in the direct interaction and conducting of all its surveys. While most of the polls are political in nature, MIPO does frequently conduct polls deemed to be in other areas of public interest. Other subjects commonly polled by MIPO include sports, economics, society and technology. In November 2013, the Institute celebrated its 35th anniversary. Partnerships In 2012, the Marist Poll teamed with NBC News and The Wall Street Journal to conduct surveys in key presidential battleground states. Consequently, MIPO accurately predicted the results of the presidential contest and U.S. Senate and governor races in each of these states. During the summer of 2013, MIPO announced they have conducted a survey on Performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in Major League Baseball. Specifically, the poll asked whether or not players linked to clinics that provide PEDs, such as Biogenesis, should be suspended‚Äîeven if they did not fail a drug test. The second question asked if players who used PEDs should receive eligibility for the Hall of Fame. On the October 22, 2013 edition of Real Sports that HBO's longtime, sports-themed monthly newsmagazine and the Marist Poll have launched a new, indefinite joint-polling initiative. Towards the end of the program on October 22, host Bryant Gumbel announced the results of a HBO Real Sports/Marist Poll: a comprehensive national survey conducted by the Marist Poll in mid-July, 2013 with more than 1,200 Americans over the age of 17 on the topic of concussions and brain trauma in football. In 2015, Marist temporarily suspended polling of the candidates for nomination during the Democratic primaries and Republican primaries out of concern that polls were being inappropriately used to decide who was included and excluded from the primaries.

The release's main improvement over Firefox 3.5 is improved performance (due to further speed improvements in the TraceMonkey JavaScript engine). It uses the Gecko 1.9.2 engine (compared to 1.9.1 in Fx 3.5), which improves compliance with web standards. It was codenamed Namoroka. In this version, support for X BitMap images was dropped. This release marked the beginning of a new development cycle for Firefox. As well as receiving major updates, the browser also received minor updates with new features. This was to allow users to receive new features more quickly and the dawn of a new roadmap that reflected these changes. It was superseded by Firefox 4, released the next year, although Fx 3.6 had a prolonged period of use and version 4 had noted user interface changes. Firefox 3.6 is the last major version of an official Firefox release to run on PowerPC-based Macintoshes (see TenFourFox for a much-more-recent version of Firefox for PowerPC-based computers running Mac OS X). Soon after 4, much less weight was given to major version numbers, with 6 numbers used by September of that year (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) compared to 3 in nearly a decade of Firefox development (1, 2 and 3). Firefox versions 4 through 9 had all reached end-of-life status while Mozilla continued supporting Firefox 3.6 with security updates. Coinciding with a proposal to cater to Enterprise users with optional Extended Support Releases beginning in 2012 based upon Firefox 10, Mozilla discontinued support for Firefox 3.6 on April 24, 2012 Upcoming Firefox Support Changes, March 23rd, 2012 with automatic update to Firefox 12 pushed out to compatible devices by June 2012.  Development  Development for this version started on December 1, 2008. The first alpha of version 3.6 was released on August 7, 2009. The first beta version was released on October 30, followed by Beta 2 on November 10, Beta 3 on November 17, Beta 4 on November 26, and Beta 5 on December 17. Release Candidate 1 was released on January 8, 2010, followed by Release Candidate 2 on January 17. The final version was released on January 21, 2010.  Minor releases  Firefox 3.6.2 was released on March 23, 2010, followed by version 3.6.3 on April 1 which closed some bugs in the ASLR and DEP handling found at the Pwn2Own contest 2010. The Firefox developers created a new feature called Lorentz. It is named after the Lorentz National Park. A preview version of Lorentz, Firefox 3.6.3plugin1, was made available on April 8, 2010. Betas of Firefox 3.6.4 were made available starting on April 20, 2010. Firefox 3.6.4 was released on June 22, 2010. The Windows and Linux versions incorporate out- of-process plug-ins (OOPP), which isolates execution of plug-ins (Adobe Flash, Apple QuickTime and Microsoft Silverlight by default) into a separate process.Chrome gets updated, Firefox 'Lorentz' enters beta This significantly reduces the number of Firefox crashes experienced by users who are watching online videos or playing games; the user can simply refresh the page to continue. Mozilla states that 30% of browser crashes are caused by third-party plugins. Support for other plug-ins by default in OOPP and on the Mac OS X platform became available in Firefox 4. Firefox 3.6.6 lengthens the amount of time a plug-in is allowed to be unresponsive to the point before the plug-in quits. Firefox 3.6.7 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.8 was a security update that was released a mere three days after 3.6.7, to fix another security fault. Firefox 3.6.9, in addition to fixing security and stability issues, introduced support for the \`X-FRAME- OPTIONS\` HTTP response header to help prevent clickjacking. Firefox 3.6.10 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.11 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.12 was a security update that fixed a critical security issue. Firefox 3.6.13 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.14 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.15 was a stability update that fixed a Java applets issue. Firefox 3.6.16 was a security update that blacklisted a few invalid HTTPS certificates. Firefox 3.6.17 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.18 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.19 was a stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.20 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.21 was a security update that blacklisted a compromised HTTPS certificate. Firefox 3.6.22 was a security update that revoked the SSL certificates for \\"Staten der Nederlanden\\" due to fraudulent SSL certificate issuance, as well as fixing an error with .gov.uk domain names. Firefox 3.6.23 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.24 was a security and stability update that fixed several issues.

Firefox 3.6.27 was a security update that fixed several issues. Firefox 3.6.28 is a security and stability update that fixed several issues.  Features  New features for Firefox 3.6 include * Built-in support for Personas (browser Graphical user interface themes) * Check and notification of out-of-date pluginsThe check is performed not inside an add-ons window (as if similar to usual add-ons), but on the Mozilla site. * Full-screen playback of Theora video * Support for the WOFF open web font format * Plug-in directory lock down: Plugins may only to be installed using a .xpi file, not through mere copying to the Firefox plugin directory. This breaks older plugins such as the Java Runtime Environment before 6 Update 15,. net framework before 1.2. * Many performance improvements  End of life  Mozilla discontinued support for Firefox 3.6 on April 24, 2012, which at over 27 months of support made it the longest supported version of Firefox, even longer than Firefox 2 which had over 26 months of total support itself. The underlying Gecko 1.9.2 engine continued to be used, with updates, in Camino.

The grant encompasses present-day Solvang and Buellton.Dise√±o del Rancho San Carlos de JonataSanta Barbara County Rancho Map History Jos√© Joaquin Carrillo (1801-1868) was the son of Domingo Antonio Ygnacio Carrillo (1791-1837) and Maria Concepcion Nicanor Pico (1797-1871). Joaquin Carrillo married Manuela Carrillo and served as Santa Barbara County Judge from 1851-1853, a position later held by Jos√© Mar√≠a Covarrubias from 1861-1863\\\\. Joaqu√≠n Carrillo owned with his brother Rancho Lompoc and Rancho Mission Vieja de la Purisma. Jos√© Mar√≠a Covarrubias (c. 1809 - 1870), a Frenchman who became a Mexican citizen and came to California in 1834 with the Hijar-Padres Colony to be a schoolteacher. Covarrubias held several key government posts in Monterey and Santa Barbara. Covarrubias married Mar√≠a Carrillo, sister of Joaqu√≠n Carrillo. He served as alcalde at Santa Barbara. In 1843 Covarrubias received the Rancho Castac land grant. Covarrubias was a member of the 1849 California Constitutional Convention, and member of the California State Assembly for four terms 1849-1862\\\\. In 1850, Covarrubias bought the Island of Santa Catalina land grant from Thomas M. Robbins. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for the six square league Rancho San Carlos de Jonata was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1853,United States. District Court (California : Southern District) Land Case 156 SD and the grant was patented to Joaqu√≠n Carrillo and Jos√© M. Covarrubias in 1872. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 Rufus Thompson (R.T.) Buell (1827-1905) was born in Vermont. In 1853 Buell joined the California Gold Rush, but by 1857 was dairy farming in Marin County, and in 1865, Monterey County. In 1866, R.T. Buell and his brother, Alonzo Wilcox Buell, bought a quarter of Rancho San Carlos de Jonata from Joaqu√≠n Carrillo and Jos√© M. Covarrubias. By 1872 R.T had bought the entire Rancho, and dissolved the partnership with his brother Alonzo. A severe drought forced Buell to sell of the rancho in the 1870s. This property was sold in 1911 to the Danish American Company to establish a Danish colony called \\"Solvang\\". The remaining rancho was partitioned among his seven heirs upon his death in 1915.

Fitzgerald was the head coach at Gonzaga for 15 seasons between 1978 and 1997 (except for 1981 to 1985) with an overall record of 252‚Äì171 (). He led the Bulldogs to their first appearance in the NCAA Tournament in 1995, after leading them to their first post-season tournament, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in 1994, where they won at Stanford in the first round. They had narrowly missed an NIT selection the previous two seasons. Gonzaga returned to the NIT in 1996. Among his recruits was future Basketball Hall of Fame member John Stockton, out of Gonzaga Prep in 1980. Fitzgerald was also responsible for hiring coaches Mark Few, Dan Monson, and Bill Grier to Gonzaga. His win total was a school record until Few passed him in 2009. Prior to his hiring in April 1978, Fitzgerald was an assistant coach for three seasons at Santa Clara, with a previous two-year stint as an assistant at Gonzaga under Adrian Buoncristiani, a high school teammate whom Fitzgerald ultimately succeeded. In between, he worked in the private sector for a year. At Gonzaga, his first season as head coach was their final year in the Big Sky Conference. Shortly after his arrival in Spokane, \\"Fitz\\" stated he was a strong proponent of moving out of the Big Sky to the WCAC. After becoming part-owner of the Spokane Indians, athletic director (and former baseball coach) Larry Koentopp resigned in the fall of 1978 and Fitzgerald took on the AD position as well. Following his third year as head coach, Fitzgerald stepped down in 1981 to focus his efforts as athletic director and hired assistant and GU alumnus Jay Hillock as head coach. Hillock resigned after four seasons in April 1985 and Fitzgerald returned to coach the Bulldogs. After making it to the NCAA Tournament a decade later, he announced in 1995 that he planned to coach two more seasons and promote Monson, a GU assistant since 1988, to head coach. After 19 years as athletic director, Fitzgerald resigned in December 1997, and was succeeded by Mike Roth. Fitzgerald then worked in private business in the Spokane area. He died in Spokane at age 67 after an apparent heart attack on January 19, 2010. Fitzgerald was also responsible for Gonzaga being put on four years of probation for keeping an illegal slush fund for recruiting purposes, hiding almost $200,000 from the NCAA. The NCAA investigators agreed that Gonzaga did not gain a competitive advantage from use of the money, since the totals spent on recruiting fell within NCAA guidelines. http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/news/1998/07/30/gonzaga_probation/ Born in San Francisco, California, Fitzgerald went to high school at St. Ignatius and attended college at Santa Clara and San Francisco State, and graduated from Cal State, Los Angeles. Prior to coaching at the college level, Fitzgerald was a high school coach and English teacher in California at Daniel Murphy (St. John Vianney) in Los Angeles and Archbishop Mitty (1968-1971) in San Jose.

It has the largest database available of contact information on US residents. Whitepages was founded in 1997 as a hobby for then-Stanford student Alex Algard. It was incorporated in 2000 and received $45 million in funding in 2005. Investors were later bought-out by Algard in 2013. From 2008 to 2013, Whitepages released several mobile apps, a re-design in 2009, the ability for consumers to control their contact information, and other features. From 2010 to 2016, the company shifted away from advertising revenue and began focusing more on selling business services and subscription products. History The idea for Whitepages was conceived by Alex Algard, while studying at Stanford in 1996. Algard was searching for a friend's contact information and the phone company gave him the wrong number. He thought of an online email directory as an easier way to find people. Algard bought the Whitepages.com domain for $900, which he says was all of his savings at the time. He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. He expanded the database of contact information using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup). Eventually WhitePages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs. In 1998, Algard left his job to focus on the website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000. The site grew and attracted more advertisers. The company brokered deals with Yellowpages and Superpages, whereby Whitepages earned revenue for sending them referral traffic. By 2005, $15 million in annual revenues was coming from these contracts. In 2003, Algard stepped down as CEO to focus on CarDomain.com, which he had also founded and Max Bardon took his place as CEO temporarily. In 2005, Technology Crossover Ventures and Providence Equity Partners invested $45 million in the company. That same year, MSN adopted Whitepages' directory data for its \\"Look it up\\" feature. Algard returned to the company in 2007. By the end of that year, the Whitepages database had grown to 180 million records and the company was listed as one of Deloitte's 500 fastest growing technology companies in North America three times. By 2008 the company had $66 million in annual revenues. In 2008, Whitepages said it would start working on options for users to control their information on the site. That same year, it acquired VoIP developer Snapvine in order to add features where users could be called through the website without giving out their phone number. It also introduced an api, which gave third-party developers access to Whitepages' data. Whitepages released an iOS app that August, followed by the Whitepages Caller ID app for Android devices in February 2009 and for Blackberry that May. The app displays information on callers, such as their latest social media posts, local weather at the caller's location and the identity of the caller. It originally had the ability to display information on callers, such as their latest social media posts, local weather at the caller's location and the identity of the caller. The ability for consumers to add themselves to the directory was added in the summer of 2009 and being able to edit existing entries was added that October. Whitepages.com underwent a re-design in 2009. According to VentureBeat reporter Matt Marshall, the redesign made the advertising \\"cleaner\\" and made it more obvious when someone was going to a third-party website like US Search. Marshall had previously criticized Whitepages, because website users that clicked on US Search ads and purchased data from US Search were sent through perpetual advertisements for other services that made it difficult to access the information they paid for. A local business lookup feature called \\"Store Finder\\" was added in June 2010. The following month, Whitepages.com launched a deal site, Dealpop.com, which differed from Groupon by offering short-term deals on nationally available products. Dealpop was sold to Tippr the following year. In 2010, Superpages and Yellowpages cut back spending with Whitepages from $33 million to $7 million, causing a substantial decline in revenues and a tense relationship with investors. Algard spent $50 million in cash the company had on-hand and $30 million from a bank loan, to buyout the investors in 2013. He also used his personal house, savings account and personal belongings as collateral for the loan. Algard began shifting the company's business model to reduce its reliance on advertising and instead focus on business users and paid subscriptions. Whitepages released the Localicious app in July 2011. The app was released on Android first, because Whitepages was frustrated with Apple's approval process for iPhone apps. Whitepages PRO was also introduced that same year. An updated Android app called Current Caller ID was released in August 2012. Within a year of its release, 5 billion calls and texts had been transmitted using the app. It was updated in July 2013 with new features, such as the ability to customize the layout of caller information for each caller and the ability to \\"Like\\" Facebook posts from within the app. In June 2013, Whitepages acquired Mr. Number, an Android app for blocking unwanted callers. In August 2013 Whitepages purchased all the interests in the company owned by investors for $80 million. In 2015, WhitePages acquired San Francisco-based NumberCorp to improve the database of phone numbers used for scams in the Caller ID app. In April 2016, Whitepages spun-off its caller ID business into a separate company called Hiya with a staff of 40 in Seattle. In September 2016, Alex Algard stepped down as CEO of WhitePages, in order to focus on the mobile spam-blocking spin-off Hiya. He appointed Rob Eleveld as the new WhitePages CEO.  Privacy  As of August 2020, users can remove their information from Whitepages by following the steps on the help page.Whitepages.com Whitepages and similar services have been criticized because of the danger caused by listing the personal information and physical addresses of unwitting people openly online, and for profiting off the exploitation of personal data.  Lawsuits  On February 1, 2017, Kevin Klingler, identified only as a resident of Illinois, filed suit in Cook County Circuit Court, alleging the behaviour of Seattle-based Whitepages violates the Illinois Right of Publicity Law.  Management  * Executive chairman and founder: Alex Algard * CEO: Leigh McMillan Services Whitepages has the largest database of contact information on Americans. As of 2008, it had data on about 90 percent of the US adult population, including 200 million records on people and 15 million business listings. Whitepages' data is collected from property deeds, telecom companies, and public records. Privacy is a common concern regarding Whitepages' publishing of personal contact information. The Whitepages.com website has features that allow users to remove themselves from the directory or correct and update information. WhitePages.com has about 50 million unique visitors per month and performs two billion searches per month. WhitePages started developing features for business users around 2010. WhitePages Pro is used for things like verifying the identity of a sales lead, find fake form data in online forms and to check form data from consumers making a purchase against common indicators of fraud, like shipping to a mailbox at an unoccupied building. In 2016, advertising on WhitePages.com was turned off in favor of selling monthly subscriptions that give users unlimited background checks and other records. As of 2013 Whitepages provides its data and related services through seven web properties, ten mobile apps and through multiple web properties, including 411.com and Switchboard.com. The Hiya app (previously known as WhitePages Caller ID) checks incoming calls against a database of phone numbers known for spam or scam calls and helps users report scams to the Federal Trade Commission. Hiya mobile app replaces the Android user interface for making and receiving phone calls.

Ibn Abd al-Hakam reports his name as Ismail ibn Obeid Allah () was an Umayyad governor of Ifriqiya (North Africa) from 718 to 720. Ismail ibn Abd Allah ibn Abu al-Muhajir (or al-Muhajjar) was from a client tribe of the Quraysh and ostensibly a grandson of Abu al-Muhajir (a former governor of Ifriqiya). In 718, Ismail ibn Abd Allah was appointed by Caliph Umar ibn AbdulAziz or Umar II to replace his predecessor's appointee, the unpopular Muhammad ibn Yazid. Ismail was one of the new crop of Umar II's competent governors, with instructions to improve the Kairouan administration and pursue the integration of non-Arab Muslims into the empire, rather than treat them as conquered peoples. As such, Ismail encouraged conversions among the Berbers of North Africa and curbed the abuses of the Arab military caste. Ismail adhered to Islamic law and eliminated extraordinary taxes and slave-tributes on Berber populations. He is credited for completing the conversion of the Berber population to Islam.Ibn Khaldun, ibid. In a curious note, Ismail ibn Abd Allah was the first and only Umayyad governor of Ifriqiya who was not given supervisory authority over Iberia (al-Andalus). In an unusual step, Caliph Umar II decided to appoint Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani as the governor of al-Andalus directly, and made him directly answerable to Damascus, rather than going through Kairouan. Ismail ibn Abd Allah's tenure was competent but short. He was relieved of his post in 720 by Umar II's successor, Caliph Yazid II and replaced by the dubious Yazid ibn Abi Muslim as governor in Kairouan.

It covers an area of approximately 36,800 km2. and serves six local government bodies - Buloke Shire Council, Hindmarsh Shire Council, Horsham Rural City Council, Northern Grampians Shire Council, West Wimmera Shire Council and Yarriambiack Shire Council. The Shires have a combined population of approximately 52,000. As these figures indicate, its clientele is predominantly rural-based and often has considerable distances between centres. The Wimmera Regional Library operates 11 static branches and one Mobile library. The Mobile library visits 17 sites over a two-week roster period.  History  In the 1860s the first library was located in the Mechanics Institute in Horsham on the corner of Firebrace and Wilson streets, then in a building in Firebrace Street. In 1872 it moved to a timber building between Pynsent Street and Roberts Avenue, where it lost many books and records in a fire in 1908. When the library re-opened in 1909 it was in a new building in Pynsent street. In 1937 the name was changed from institute library to Horsham Public Library (the Horsham Mechanics Institute being the first in country Victoria to become a public library). It was called a ‚Äúfree library‚Äù although only subscribers could borrow, non-subscribers were allowed to read on the premises. Horsham Mechanics Institute World War II postponed plans to consign the library to the Council as a municipal project, but in April 1949 the Horsham City Council took over control of the Mechanics Institute. They financed the library, and conducted it as a municipal free library ‚Äì \\"City of Horsham Free Library\\" under a liberal subsidy from the State Government. The Institute building became Council property and was renovated and extended. In 1951 the Wimmera Shire joined the Horsham City Council in financing the Library. An approach was made to the State Government Library Board in 1955 and in 1957 the Horsham Public Library was established, and The Wimmera & Dunmunkle Shires joined ‚Äì the Library was then known as ‚ÄúThe Horsham & Dunmunkle Municipal Libraries‚Äù. (Wimmera Shire residents used the City resources until the introduction of the Bookmobile in 1967) In 1962 Lowan and Kaniva Shires joined. After many meetings and discussions between the Shires and the Library Board, the inaugural meeting of the Wimmera Regional Library Service was held in June 1966 and the WRLS formed. From October 1966 it included the Shires of Arapiles, Birchip, Donald, Dunmunkle, Kaniva, Karkarooc, Lowan, Wimmera & Warracknabeal and Horsham City Council. With the joining of Birchip, Donald, Karkarooc & Warracknabeal Shires, the Library Service now covered a total of 10 municipalities, with an area of 7,871 square miles (18,000sq km) and a population of 40,694 people. Branches were at Horsham, Kaniva, Minyip, Murtoa, Nhill & Rupanyup. The Bookmobile opened in June 1967 operating in Birchip, Donald & Karkarooc Shires, and sites were at Birchip town & schools, Watchupga, Donald town & schools, Watchem, Hopetoun town & schools, Beulah town & schools, Lascelles, Patchewollock, Speed, Tempy & Woomelang. At this time the Addressograph Libromatic Scheme replaced the Browne System, this involved new book & borrower cards and complete borrower re-registration. In March 1968 the bookmobile began service in Arapiles Shire. An offer of bookmobile service to Dunmunkle was rejected in 1969-70, however early in 1977 it was trialled, and this time the offer was accepted and the Minyip & Murtoa branches were closed in March 1981 and their stock transferred to Rupanyup. In January 1975 a Library Council report into the Stawell Library joining the Wimmera Regional Library Service was released, but no further action was taken. Further discussions in March 1976 also stalled due to a lack of financial support from the Library Council. Discussions began with the Shires of Kowree and Kara Kara and the Town of St Arnaud in June 1983 about the possibility of them joining the library service. Following their decision to join, service began on 1 October 1984 to St Arnaud Town and the Kara Kara Shire. The Kowree Shire Library amalgamated with the WRLS in March 1986. A Mobile service was provided to Goroke with branches in Edenhope, Harrow and a joint-use facility in Apsley (Apsley closed on 13 April 1987). Computerisation of the library's collection was first discussed in March 1972, and conversion of the card catalogue to microfiche had begun September 1980. In 1988 as part of the introduction of a computerised library management system renovations were made to disused toilets at the rear of the Mibus Centre building to create a computer room, and storage area for the Mobile Library. A committee chose Stowe Computing on 1 December 1988, and the first AS400 computer was installed on 2 February 1989. In April 1989 computerisation of stock began, the first branch to offer automated service was Horsham on 25 September 1989. Stawell Regional Library finally amalgamated with WRLS in October 1993, and the Mobile library began to visit Stawell Shire sites on 31 January 1994. Local government re-structure began in January 1995, this led to WRLS member council changing from 15 to 6 (Buloke, Hindmarsh, Horsham, Northern Grampians, West Wimmera & Yarriambiack), the size of the region increased to 36,800 km2. The new Library Corporation was gazetted in April 1996 as the Wimmera Regional Library Corporation. Local Government elections were held in March 1997, and councillors returned to office. The new Wimmera Regional Library Board first met 17 April 1997. On 12 January 1996 Horsham was the first branch of the WRLC to log onto the Internet via local service provider WimmeraNet. Other branches started offering Internet access from December 1996. Also in 1996 the Library provided its first ‚ÄúFood for thought‚Äù program on community 3HHH radio. WRLC joined the Murraylink consortia in 1998 - a group of public libraries initially based along the Murray River in Victoria. Murraylink programs included a joint materials tender and roving collections of materials. The Library Management System changed from Stowe's BookPlus to Geac's Libs+ in June‚ÄìJuly 1999. MacroPlan/PractiCo undertook a library review into different service delivery methods in 2000. This was followed in April 2001 by John Liddle of J.L. Management Services being employed by the State Government to assess the future direction of the library service & to develop a model which could be used for other library services. The Project extended from May 2001 to March 2002 and led to Service & Funding Agreements ‚Äì a ‚Äúfee for service‚Äù arrangement, rationalisation of service sites and opening hours. Satellite Internet access was provided at Horsham branch & Headquarters as part of a Rural Libraries Online project 2000/01, designed to help rural libraries move to faster Internet access. In July 2003 the first ADSL Internet connections were established at Horsham & Stawell. Birchip Library In 2005 discussion began about the purchase of a new Library Management System, and the decision was made to join the Swift Consortium, which was planning for a joint system purchase, in early 2006. The new Library Management System ‚Äì Sirsi-Dynix's Unicorn system went live on 3 April 2007.  Branches = Birchip  The Birchip library is a joint-use library with the local P-12 school. The joint- use proposal was first discussed in 1977, and finally agreed to in 1982, with the sign-off in April/May 1983. The joint-use facility began operating in February 1983, at the Birchip Community Education Complex and the three Birchip bookmobile stops ceased. Governance is between the Birchip P-12 School, the Buloke Shire and the Wimmera Regional Library Corporation. Renovations to the building at the end of 2009 created a new circulation desk and entrance area.  Dimboola  Dimboola Library The first library in Dimboola was the Mechanics Institute in 1878, although a service had operated in 1877 in a rented building. The first subscription library closed in October 1935 and re-opened to subscriptions in November 1935. A proposal to operate a public library was made by the Victorian State Government in 1974, and Carol Ely of the Public Libraries Division undertook a report in June-Aug 1981. Other investigations about suitable library services continued up to council restructure, with various proposals made in 1989, 1990 and 1991. Finally in June 1995 the WRLS secured a $38,000 Library Development Grant for the establishment of public library service to the former Dimboola Shire. Mobile service to Jeparit & Rainbow began on 7 November 1995, and the Dimboola Branch Library/Hindmarsh Shire Customer Service Centre opened in May 1996 (official opening 11 June 1996) as a joint venture between the Shire & the Library in the old Shire offices building.  Edenhope  The Kowree Shire had previously operated a stand-alone single municipality library service. An approach was made by the Shire in July 1968 for information and costs associated with entering the Library Service. The Library's proposal suggested a preference for a mobile service instead of deposit stations for the small towns. No action was taken and the options were investigated again in August 1983. Finally in 1985 after another report by the Library Council of Victoria, agreement was reached on amalgamation of the two library services. The Kowree stock was added into the Wimmera collection and the Kowree Shire joined the WRLS on 31 March 1986. The Library is located in the Shire Offices.  Goroke  The first library in the town was the Mechanics Institute in 1889. As part of the Kowree Free Library service, a small room in the Town Hall served as the Goroke Library. When the Kowree Shire joined the WRLS in 1986, a Mobile library service was initially provided to Goroke outside the Town Hall and outside the school. The Mobile ceased visiting in December 1987, and library services returned to the Town Hall until the Library moved across the road to a refurbished shop in July 2007. The official opening was on 14 July 2007 conducted by Minister Richard Wynne and West Wimmera mayor Darren Rayner.  Harrow  Library services are provided to the Harrow community from a room in the Harrow Hall. The entire collection and furniture was lost when the Hall burnt to the ground in 1976. When the new Hall was built on the same site, a room on the south side of the Hall was set aside as the Library. Following on the amalgamation of the Kowree Shire service with the WRLS, the Harrow branch, opens for 3 hours a week, with the majority of the book stock provided on a rotational basis from the Stawell library.  Horsham  Horsham LibraryThe Horsham Library began in the Mechanics Institute building in Pynsent Street, but in December 1968 it moved to a purpose-built area in the Mibus Memorial Cultural Centre in McLachlan St (site of the former Temperance Hall which the Council compulsorily acquired from its Trustees, with the neighbouring block owned by Mrs Elizabeth Nattrass). The Centre housed the Horsham Library, Library Headquarters, & Art Gallery. The Mibus Centre was a memorial for Mick Mibus, Member for Lowan & Minister for Water Supply who died in 1964. It was opened by Mibus‚Äô widow, and the Premier Sir Henry Bolte unveiled the plaque. At the end of 1970 an engineer's report found the building had buckled, distorted & sagged, with Horsham's constant problem of expansive clay soils. Council took the builders and designers to court and won the settlement. In May 1978 the Horsham Library moved to temporary premises in the rear of the Langlands building with a third of the stock, to allow repairs to the Mibus Centre to begin. Headquarters continued to operate from the Mibus Centre during this period. In January 1979 the Horsham Library re-opened in the Mibus Centre. Minor building works continued in the 1970s and 80s to accommodate the introduction of computerisation and changes to workflows and throughput. The Horsham Rural City Council secured a Living Libraries Grant to extend and renovate the Library branch in 2004 with building works beginning in February 2005. The Support Centre section was renovated in 2009 as a result of increased stock movements resulting from involvement in the Swift consortia.  Kaniva  The Mechanics Institute began in Kaniva in 1884. In 1922 the Mechanics Institute decided to build a Soldier's Memorial Hall and Club room at the dead-end of Dingey Street. Built of Mt Gambier stone it opened on 8 February 1923. The WRLS Kaniva Branch officially opened in July 1964, in a small shop in the main street. On 13 February 1969 the new Library building was officially opened by Vance O. Dickie MLC, State Minister of Health, as part of the Civic buildings (including the Infant Welfare and Pre-School Centres) in Baker St, on the site of the old Kaniva electricity supply power- house which had stood there between 1925-1964.  Nhill  Nhill's Mechanics Institute began in 1884, and in April 1910 the newly created Free Library Reading Room and circulating library was opened. In 1911 the institution comprised a reading room, newspaper room, billiard room and a smoking room. Lowan Shire Council agreed on 1 October 1963 to join the WRLS, with the Free Library Committee giving whole-hearted co-operation. The FLC sold its library in Clarence Street to the MUIOOF Lodge to obtain funds to construct an annexe to the new municipal building to house the new Nhill Library. FLC transferred its stock to the annexe and assisted in completing & fitting out the buildings interior. At its last meeting 7 October 1963 it agreed to hand over all its assets to the Lowan Shire. The Library Branch was officially opened on 20 December 1963 by President Cr Lindsay Hensley as part of the new Lowan Shire offices, with a bookstock of 2,400. The Nhill library was moved from the Shire offices to a shop in the main street in February 1995, and in November 1997 the library moved back to the MUIOOF Hall in Clarence Street after an interval of 35 years.  St. Arnaud  St. Arnaud LibraryA Library Council of Victoria report suggested that St Arnaud & Kara Kara Shires should consider joining the WRLS in Jan-March 1982. The municipalities had been receiving government subsidies for the previous 2 years. There was also a proposal from the then Stawell Regional Library for St Arnaud & Kara Kara to join them in June 1984. St Arnaud resolved to join the WRLS in July 1984. The branch began service in the Mechanics Institute in Inkerman Street on 1 October 1984 for 24 hours per week. It moved to part of the new Municipal Offices and the Town Hall complex in Napier Street in September 1985, and was officially opened on 22 November 1985. In 2001 Northern Grampians Shire secured a Living Libraries Grant to renovate and extend the existing building to provide more library space. This was the culmination of extended discussions about the library location which had started in July 1996.  Stawell  In 1975 a Library Council of Victoria report proposed that the Stawell Regional Library should join with WRLS, and an initial meeting between the WRLS and Stawell was held in March 1976. Another Library Council of Victoria report in 1977 also proposed amalgamation. Stawell Regional Library attempted amalgamation with Ararat in early 1970s and 1980s, but no agreement eventuated. The Shire of Stawell again reviewed library service in a report in July 1991. In July 1993 Stawell looked at a Co-operation Grant application for computerisation of Stawell Regional Library utilising WRLS's AS400 computer. Stawell Regional Library finally amalgamated with WRLS in October 1993.  Warracknabeal  The Warracknabeal Branch opened in a purpose built building in Lyle St in November 1968, which incorporated a set of three stained glass windows depicting the evolution of the district at three critical times - 1846, 1870 and 1940. These windows were incorporated into the newly renovated building when the Yarriambiack Shire secured a Living Libraries Grant in 2003. Library service was conducted next door in the Leisure Centre while building was underway. The renovated library building was officially opened in September 2006 by Minister Candy Broad.  Mobile Library  The first WRLC Mobile LibraryThe Mobile library was officially opened with a Bedford TK model truck with body made by Bodycraft of Geelong in June 1967, by the State Librarian Mr K. Horn, Initially operating in Birchip, Donald and Karkarooc Shires, it commenced service to Arapiles (Natimuk) in March 1968. The Service was extended to Yaapeet in February 1969, but an offer to Dunmunkle was rejected in 1969. In 1971‚Äì72 there were 27 towns visited ‚Äì Banyena, Beulah town and school, Birchip (plus 3 schools), Brim East, Cannum, Donald and 3 schools, Dooen, Hopetoun and 3 schools, Jung, Kalkee, Lascelles, Longerenong, McKenzie Creek, Natimuk, Netherby, Noradjuha, Nurrabiel, Patchewollock and school, Quantong, St Helen's Plains, Sheep Hills, Speed, Tempy, Toolondo, Vectis, Watchupga School, Watchem School, Woomelang School, Yaapeet and Yanac. In June 1980 a new semi-trailer was introduced, the WRLS was the second library region, after Swan Hill, to use a semi-trailer. The trailer was purchased from Carrum Downs Motor Bodies and the Louisville LN700 prime mover from Provincial Motors in Bendigo. The Minyip and Murtoa sites were added to the timetable in February 1981. When Kowree joined the WRLS in 1986, mobile service was provided to Goroke in March, but ceased in December. WRLC's Mobile LibraryA new Mitsubishi FP418 prime mover was purchased in July 1992 for $70,748. When Stawell Regional Library joined WRLS in 1993, the Mobile Library served the sites previously visited by the Stawell caravan. Operation began at Hindmarsh Shire sites ‚Äì Jeparit and Rainbow in November 1995. In October 1995 the service was extended to Dergholm and Poolaijelo in the West Wimmera Shire, formerly served by Glenelg Regional Library. A new Mobile Library trailer made by Brimarco Industries in Ballarat was introduced to service in January 1997, after going to tender in July 1996. The old trailer was 17 years old. The Mitsubishi prime mover was replaced by an Iveco from Maneys in Mt Gambier, in July 2004.

Liberal institutionalism The majority of scholarly literature in international relations approaches environmental problems from a liberal institutionalist perspective focusing on international environmental regimes. There is a relationship between Globalization and Environment which is among the forces behind the birth of green theory. However a unified theory is missed. Controversy of the human species as world managers where \\"conservation\\" is \\"right use\\" of nature and \\"preservation\\" is \\"right non-use\\" of nature and humanity as protecting nature against itself with little allowance for ecological dynamics is part of the cause for some \\"essentially contested concepts\\" where even \\"sustainable development\\" is sometimes contested. The \\"collective action problem\\" is central to cooperation. It is discussed by Michael Laver (1997) with examples of \\"The Prisoner's dilemma\\" and the \\"Tragedy of the commons.\\" The disconnect between individual goals and group goals suggests a role for leadership and more than simple management. Green theory has championed consensus decision making as best it can be done. Empowering the disempowered is also a strand in Green theory. Interactions are important to Green theory. Stephen W. Littlejohn (1983) discusses macronetworks with members and links. The five properties of links are: (1) symmetry (how much who relates to who or how equal the communication is); (2) strength (how often who relates to who); (3) reciprocity (agreement between members of links); (4) content (what the area or context of communication is); and, (5) mode (what the means or context of communication is). Network communication is a bridge to appreciating the interdependence of ecosystems. International Regimes is a classic IR work edited by Stephen D. Krasner (1983) which discusses emergent norms in complex (international) systems. International regimes are deemed to be a collective solution to problems of turbulence and unpredictability. On the micro level, Marshall Rosenberg suggests people must agree on the description of the situation, agree on the stakeholders' feelings, agree on the stakeholders' needs, and then agree on the stakeholders' requests in order for healthy negotiation to be possible. In veridical conflict, when it occurs, there may not be a mutually satisfactory resolution possible. Green IPE This field studies the impact of IPE (international political economy) and it has been widely accepted as an area within IR theory. The strongest protesters of such irregular emigration movements are the ecofeminists who tend to gather once a month to hold non- peaceful and noisy demonstrations. J. K. Galbraith says in The Age of Uncertainty that economics entails understanding the relationship of people with land. Green theory uses case studies of people living on land to better understand economy. Later, the idea of \\"ecological footprint\\" developed. Green leaders use suasion, persuasion, exemplification and all the techniques of public relations and propaganda to shift the publics' tastes towards green decisions both in markets and in other areas where decisions, goals, or choices are being made. As Fraser P. Seitel] (1989) says there are many \\"publics\\" and many choices. Places or contexts of choices matter too. Green theory rewrites the rules for consumers. David R. Boyd and David T. Suzuki (2008) is one example. The public as workers is critical to Green theory. The greening of the labour market, workplace, and industry is important. One wonders, as democracy is valued in Green theory, what the appropriate attitude towards \\"economic democracy\\" would be. Robert A. Dahl (1985) argues weakly in favour of workplace democracy. If the factors of production are land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship, it is unclear how these can be democratically related and what kind of property rights might survive. Joseph Heath (2009) describes \\"capitalism\\" as a \\"nexus of relationships\\" (as between suppliers, producers, consumers, marketers, regulators, for example). Green theory is complex in its management of policy networks. The New Age idea of \\"segmented, polycentric, integrated networks\\" (SPINs) suggests a possible complex replacement for capitalism. In public administration the idea of \\"governance\\" systems addresses some of the complexity. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's idea of \\"noosphere\\" as a connection and link thick environment where multilateral group, system, organization, and network interrelations can instantiate human wisdom is also possible for Green theory. \\"Globalization\\" is commonly understood to involve cross-border flows. This can be transportation of material or people, transmission of information or ideas, transfer of capital or ownership, transactions altering status, transmissions of disease and disease causing organisms, trade in goods and services, transfers of technology or industrial arts and products, and may be considered a stage of \\"modernization\\" and/or \\"development.\\" Global flows are to be monitored and controlled through many local actions. For this 'globalization' to work, local decisions must successfully restrict the perverse effects of global flows. A margin for error must be maintained. Free trade appears to be focused upon free markets. Yet, even Raymond Vernon (1977) suggests that a multinational corporation could serve as a non-tariff barrier to free trade. You could go further and suggest that concentrations of purchasing power and control over property rights might serve to restrict \\"free trade\\" even if we do not wish to have the total equality of no concentrations of wealth. Free markets are not free if those who have wealth can control flows and restrictions as well as the litigation over disputes. Control over energy and power, likewise, serves to replace the slave trade. \\"Nature\\" is never clearly enough defined. Natural resources and natural flows of energy and nutrients are neither entirely free nor entirely artificial. No one, apparently, wants total energy entropy (insofar as it can be delayed). It seems that a mixed economy may be best suited to the \\"natural\\" as complete rational planning and complete free markets are no friends to nature. This assumption is, of course, quite contestable. Normative and cosmopolitan One aspect of Green IR theory is normative theorising such as bioregionalism. The idea of a \\"land ethic\\" and the belief that people can \\"think globally and act locally\\" have given hope that norms can be directly or indirectly derived from nature. Futurology and counterfactual reasoning, such as that promoted by Philip E. Tetlock and Aaron Belkin (1996), may just as easily produce dystopias as utopias. Environmental security, while still questionable, is at least more basic than human security. Likewise, \\"ecology\\" (the study of households or habitats) has priority over \\"economics\\" (the applied laws of households or habitats). The fit between people and their environments brings up the topic of positive and negative eugenics which has been a background challenge in Green theory. Healthy and unhealthy have seemed to replace the theology of good and evil. Holistic health is a popular part of green theories combined with green living. Public health with prevention and health promotion are more consistent with Green theory too. The non-violent thread in Green theory has led to an anti-hierarchical standard which can seem to be anarchical in this theory. Eco-feminists may hold anti-hierarchical views. Living wages and more equality may be emphasized. Ernest Callenbach's \\"Ecotopia\\" seems to almost be a matriarchal totalitarianism. The choices and liberties can be shifted in Green theory. Turn taking among Green leaders means sometimes the responsibilities of power and sometimes being the follower. All this within groups attempting consensus with group skills added to communication skills which can be overpowering. A behavioural space with contingencies, classical and operant conditioning, plus systems of semiotic systems with underlying structures, even for individual cells, organisms, groups, and all conceivable units of analysis could certainly be overpowering. It would seem to be a case of Michel Foucault's \\"governmentality\\" where both individuals and populations are simultaneously controlled. And the governmentality would grow and evolve. Growth of any particular species can be in numbers, qualities, adaptations (fitting in), and adjustments (changes to environment) which makes for complex practical syllogisms. As Thomas Szasz said in \\"Ideology and Insanity\\": \\"stars move, machines function, animals behave, and people conduct themselves.\\" It is an idea of \\"ecopsychology\\" that contact with nature promotes mental health and wellness. According to Morris Berman (1996) there is a \\"Shadow Side of Systems\\". Just as democracy can make for a tyranny of the majority so can systems thinking provide for authoritarianism and/or paternalism. A case study of Green theorists' dealing with the issue of \\"abortion\\" can illustrate this matter. Life and choice are both important to Green theorists. Disconnecting the conception decision from the birth decision can have eugenic consequences. Perhaps females could take charge of reproductive technology but then they would be in charge of eugenics too. The compromises of living where you like and liking where you live; of doing what you like and liking what you do; and, of having the child you like and liking the child you have‚Äîthese do not make choices easier. Do we love the people we love and love the people we love‚Äîboth? Green theory does not always distinguish public space from private space. As for political ideologies and Green theory, Timothy O'Riordan (1990) indicates there to be \\"dry greens\\" (perhaps conservative and market centered), \\"shallow greens\\" (perhaps liberal and sustainable development centered), and \\"deep greens\\" (perhaps radical and ecosystem or earth centered). This, of course, may be an oversimplification. \\"Dry Greens\\" may be the least appreciated environmentalists and might not even be given that title. However, a very good economic treatment is given in \\"The Plundered Planet\\" by Paul Collier (2010). Collier may put the plight of the bottom billion (poorest and worst off people) on the planet above environmentalism. He believes protecting the viability of the planet and the bottom billion must both be done. Green theorists, of course, emphasize equality such that the bottom billion are equal to the top billion. How that works out is challenging. If the planet does need a billion fewer people, then there is no agreed upon way of choosing. Market solution would include rising food prices and only those with ability to pay survive. Each culture, religion, and academic discipline has developed and produced different solutions to the \\"Who survives?\\" conundrum. Security Studies Green IR approaches have challenged traditional approaches to security in international relations. This has included the concept of environmental security which has involved the 'securitization' of environmental threats. While Green theory embraces non-violence and condemns the toxicity of much military materials, civilian defence and protest have long been used as tactics. Appropriate technology, even for military use, is becoming more preferred. Green theorists may dispense with much strategic security planning as letting the laws of nature take their course. John H. Storer (1953, 1956, pp. 76 ‚Äì 77) mentions some of the laws of nature as: adaptation, succession, multiplication, and, control, such that a species occupies a niche with a carrying capacity and limiting factors. This is the long view of strategy. Strategy is assumed to be phylogenetic and tactics more ontogenetic (as may be morals and ethics respectively). Families and nations may be similar and different. John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt (1996) suggest that fractal thinking may highlight fractal warfare. Swords and spears, the tools of regular warfare, may be changed to plows and pruning-hooks, the tools of eugenic management. As for the short view, private security or acting locally may be of interest. Harvey Burstein (1994) gives five items that security staff must control: crime, waste, accidents, errors, and unethical practices. Such is the short view of tactics‚Äîalbeit from an environmental perspective. Even the best \\"securitization\\" cannot eliminate error. The items that security controls also have their carrying capacities and limiting factors. Control may interact with higher level controls and counter-controls like a flow chart. Agenda 21, that optimistic document for the beginning of the Twenty-first Century, seeks to control all accidents so that human beings can live in safety. It failed, but it can provide a guide for those who think globally and act locally. The move from human centered to ecosystem centered thinking and feeling may, ironically, be an improvement to humanity. An area of challenge to all IR theories is secrecy and surveillance along with control of information. Monitoring is necessary for protection and control (security) but sometimes secrecy is necessary too. Realism, capitalism, and socialism could not handle secrecy well and it remains to be seen whether Green theory's handling of secrecy could not create worse disasters. Transparency and democracy may not be appropriate political technologies for all decisions. Further discussion of power, secrecy vs. espionage, persuasion vs. evaluation, and information control is in \\"Policing Politics: Security Intelligence and the Liberal Democratic State\\" by Peter Gill (1994). Citizen policing of politics goes with empowering the disempowered and consensus. Perhaps \\"subsidiarity\\" may be needed with a secret \\"black box\\" at the appropriate level of decision making which is always the lowest possible. It would be a good exercise in Green Theory to consider Derrick Jensen's \\"Twenty Premises\\" from his books \\"Endgame: Volumes I & II\\" (2006) with \\"Agenda 21\\" and its efforts to control humanity and the environment to produce security. Is a graceful transition from the present world to a greener future world possible? How possible? A critical point in the history of Green Theory is 1992 when, of course, the Rio Conference happened. Also Biodiversity and Global Warming became more important. Emphasis may have moved from local ecosystems to the global ecosystem. One book published at this time in which the author seeks perhaps to rescue Greens from themselves and provide a revisionist Green policy is Green Political Theory by Robert E. Goodin (1992). It was a timely criticism. He compares a capitalist theory of value based upon consumer satisfaction; a socialist theory of value based upon labour; and, a Green theory of value based upon natural resources. He also discusses the weakness for international organization of a highly decentralized political system. Perhaps in answer, \\"Leaders lead; but none too much,\\" might provide a solution to Michel's 'iron law of oligarchy' where leaders can do job rotation with teaching environmental education, group decision-making, policy-making, as well as with other leaders, taking turns with administrative and diplomatic tasks. Much leaders make for much participation and many types of participation. Therefore, diversity is increased. Goodin (1992) also discusses norms or values by focusing on \\"goods\\" and \\"the good\\" as well as \\"agency\\" which is more in the direction of \\"the right.\\" Such a critical analysis of Green Theory at what is also a critical point in history is invaluable. An obvious modern point about environment and security is distribution of risk and even global flows of risk. If the rich are not to be protected too much, then it also might follow that the poor are not to be protected too much as well. Proper balance is not the mere matter of comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable. Ulrich Beck and others have written on the \\"risk society\\" which seems to enter into the discussions both of economy and security. Subsidiarity may include levels of government which share authority, for example, national government, religious or organizational government, family government, and individual government. There would not seem to be a monopoly over use of force. There may be a tendency for eco-anarchism here. Just as we may use computer software to determine such things as financial crime and corruption, we might also use actuarial tables to determine unjust distribution of risk. We would have to find ways to prevent \\"fait accompli\\" acts of the powerful to the less powerful. This goes far beyond environmental impact statements or even studies. It is a whole fabric with the socio- economic structures. Solving the problem of a gentle transition to a green future can be difficult. Between Derrick Jensen's \\"Endgame 1 & 2\\" and Donald R. Liddick's (2006) \\"Eco-Terrorism\\", it can seem like opposite sides must be taken. Liddick's book was published by Praeger Publishers Praeger Publishers may also have published \\"Crimes Against Nature\\" also by Donald R. Liddick (2011) and \\"The Rise of the Anti-Corporate Movement\\" by Evan Osborne (2007). If Green theorists are to take consensus decision-making quite seriously, then bringing the environmental skeptics on board to the gentle transition becomes very important to a Green future. The question of whether (national) government alone must have a monopoly over the legitimate use of force has been contested for some time. Should national government also have a monopoly of the use of fear, violence, and terror and would this ever be legitimate? Can dissent, protest, and civil disobedience and holding the viewpoint of subversion of the current system be justified? Is the \\"right to rebel\\" really a euphemism for the \\"right to revolt\\"? It seems one other book: Crime Wars: The Global Intersection of Crime, Political Violence, and International Law by Paul Battersby, Joseph M. Siracusa, and Sasho Ripiloski (2011) might be worth reading. But, books like Folks, This Ain't Normal by Joel Salatin (2011) and Green is the New Red by Will Potter (2011) may also be worth reading. Green theorists sometimes shift the meanings of \\"rights\\" and \\"freedoms\\" but a book to be published this year by Praeger Publishers about \\"Eco-psychology\\" (in two volumes) by Darlyne G. Nemeth, Robert B. Hamilton, and Judy Kuriansky, according to their catalogue would seem to shift some of the standard Green vocabulary. Even \\"eco-terrorism\\" is a use of a label with often pejorative connotations. It seems there is a battle going on over the future of Green discourse. We may have to rethink definitions for \\"genocide\\" and \\"ecocide\\" with both broad and narrow definitions for each and how much powers and authorities whether those of people and families, organizations (religious or otherwise), governments (at all levels), or businesses can be criminalized and especially where and how prevention can best be practiced. The Encyclopedia of Earth website is apparently neutral and non-controversial. Green theory has many essentially contested concepts. Encyclopedia of Earth may also be in the process of updating its ideas of biosecurity and bioterrorism. Antonio Gramsci's ideas of \\"war of manoeuvre\\" (real war in physical space) and \\"war of position\\" (war of words or what in Michel Foucault's terms could be a discussion and shaping of a discourse space) are pertinent to what is currently happening. John Stuart Mill's On Liberty applies to discourse rather well for a standard 'liberal' approach which, itself, is not neutral. It is supposed that Green thinkers clearly realize that much discussion need not lead to consensus and there can still remain veridical conflicts. Whether the 'soft energy path' and a 'steady-state economy' can actually be made to work require further theory and practice too. The making of a fait accompli by mass ecocide or mass genocide (whether these be sudden or gradual) can hopefully be avoided. When it comes to a 'war of position' and discourse, the subject of 'ecocriticism' becomes important. Timothy Clark has written two interesting books on this topic: The Cambridge Introduction to Literature and the Environment (2011) and The Value of Ecocriticism (2019). Plato made the observation that an expert on the literature of the \\"Iliad\\" might not be suitable to be a general. Experts at environmental literature are expected to have at least minimal competency in environmental science or some equivalent. Multitasking in areas of high complexity and many levels of analysis (scales) shall not be easy.

In profession, he was a master mason, building trades foreman, Nazi Party member and member of the Schutzstaffel with the rank of SS- Unterscharf√ºhrer (corporal). He supervised construction of the gas chambers for the Action T4 euthanasia program at Hartheim, Sonnenstein, Bernburg and Hadamar, and then at Sobib√≥r and Treblinka extermination camps during Operation Reinhard. He specialized in building larger gas chambers that killed more people than previous efforts in the extermination program. Biography Lambert was born on 7 December 1909 in Schildow, a small town in M√ºhlenbecker Land, in the Niederbarnim district. His father was killed in the First World War; his stepfather owned a construction firm in Schildow. After basic schooling, Lambert became an apprentice, first to a locksmith, and then to a mason. After passing his apprentice exam, he attended a school for the building trades in Berlin in the mid-1920s and passed his examination for master mason in the mid-1930s. He was always employed as a mason and, after becoming a master mason, as a foreman for various Berlin construction firms.Henry Friedlander (1995). The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 214-215. Lambert joined the Nazi Party in March 1933, after Hitler's assumption of national power, and first worked within the Party as a Blockleiter in Schildow.Klee, Ernst: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945?. Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2003 Lambert was not yet a member of any of the party's paramilitary organizations. Late in 1939, the Action T4 program tried to recruit Lambert, who had been recommended by the local office of the German Labour Front. He accepted the offer in January 1940. Lambert was hired to serve as a construction foreman who supervised the other workers; he was \\"the traveling construction boss of Action T4\\". Construction of gas chambers Gas chamber at Bernburg, designed by Erwin Lambert Lambert's primary task was to direct construction work at the T4 killing centres, particularly the construction of gas chambers and crematoria. In testimony Lambert claimed that he merely erected room dividers and installed doors, a claim largely discredited. Since Brandenburg and Grafeneck had already been completed before Lambert joined the T4 program, he worked at Hartheim, Sonnenstein, Bernburg, and Hadamar as the program's \\"expert for the construction of gas chambers\\". After T4's termination, Lambert was posted to Operation Reinhard in Lublin reservation for the purpose of bricklaying assignments which constructed the gas chambers in Sobib√≥r and Treblinka extermination camps. At Lublin Lambert joined the SS. During this time, however, his work was often interrupted for further construction jobs in Germany and Austria involving the still-ongoing Action 14f13. With the help of Ukrainian volunteers, and condemned Jewish prisoners, Lambert constructed solid gassing facilities at Sobibor and Treblinka: \\"Using his expert knowledge about gassing installations, Lambert was able rapidly to complete all work on the big gas house [in Treblinka]\\". During his testimony at the Sobib√≥r trial in Hagen, Germany (whose lead defendant was Kurt Bolender), lasting from 6 September 1965 until 20 December 1966, Lambert stated: In addition, Lambert directed construction at several nearby forced labour camps such as Dohorucza and the Poniatowa concentration camp. Reportedly, Lambert attempted to remain an uninvolved expert devoted solely to his work and not interested in the conditions which surrounded it. According to one survivor, Jankiel Wiernik, Lambert avoided looking at dead bodies and treated his Jewish workers in a professional manner. At the conclusion of Operation Reinhard, Lambert was posted to Trieste, where he continued installing cremation facilities at the concentration camp Risiera di San Sabba. After the war, Lambert was arrested on 28 March 1962. At the First Treblinka Trial in 1965, Lambert was tried for the first time and sentenced to four years' imprisonment for aiding and abetting the murder of at least 300,000 people.Treblinka Trial Having already served this time, he was allowed to live as a free man. At the Sobib√≥r Trial in 1966, Lambert was acquitted.Sobibor Trial at the Holocaust Research Project. At the trials Lambert denied involvement in the killing operation and claimed that he merely suspected that the buildings would be used for killing. Lambert died on 15 October 1976.

It follows the story of many settlers who have travelled across space to build a new future on the planet Deucalion. However the future is uncertain for the Elokoi or Icarus people who were settled on the planet first. Background Deucalion was first published in Australia on 1 September 1995 by the University of Queensland Press in trade paperback format. In 1996 it was published as an audiobook by Louis Braille Books and in 2002 it was released in the United Kingdom by Flyways. It has also been distributed to North America by International Specialized Book Services. Deucalion joint won along with Garth Nix's Sabriel the 1995 Aurealis Award for best young-adult novel and was a short-list nominee for the 1996 Children's Book Council of Australia: Book of the Year, Older Readers award. Setting The novel opens in the late 23rd century AD, by which time, humanity has explored light years out into space. However, only one habitable planet has been discovered, named Deucalion. Deucalion is 34 light-years away from Earth, with one large continent and an inland sea. Deucalion has a native sentient population, named the Elokoi, similar to H.G Wells' Eloi from The Time Machine. The Elokoi are at a level of civilisation similar to the Stone Age. Both Human and Elokoi settlements are only on the east coast of the continent, however, human settlers have forced the Elokoi to live on reservations. The human capital is called New Geneva.

Beauvoir held one of the highest titles of Voudou priesthood, \\"Supreme Servitur\\" (supreme servant), a title given to Houngans and Mambos (Voudou priests and priestesses) who have a great and very deep knowledge of the religion, and status within the religion. As Supreme Servitur, Max was seen as a high authority within Vodou. Biography Beauvoir was born on August 25, 1936, in Haiti. He left Haiti in the 1950s and graduated in 1958 from City College of New York with a degree in chemistry. He continued his studies at the Sorbonne from 1959 to 1962, when he graduated with a degree in biochemistry. In 1965, at Cornell Medical Center, he supervised a team in synthesizing metabolic steroids. This led him to a job at an engineering company in northern New Jersey, and later to a period as engineer at Digital Equipment Company in Massachusetts. His interest in steroids led him to experiment with hydrocortisone synthesized from plants; however, the death of his father led him to move back to Haiti in January 1973 and become a voodoo priest. In 1974, he founded Le P√©ristyle de Mariani,What is The Temple of Yehwe a Hounfour in his home (which also served as a village clinic) in the village of Mariani. He had a troubled relationship with the ruling Duvalier family. While he urged that they do more to meet the medical needs of the poor, his status as a houngan kept him from being subjected to much of the wanton violence exacted by the Tonton Macoutes against critics. During this period, he founded the Group for Studies and Research on the African Tradition (, GERT) with a group of scholars, and later founded the B√≤de Nasyonal in 1986 to counter the effects of the post-Duvalier dechoukaj violence which had targeted both Vodou practitioners and the Tonton Macoutes paramilitary, both of which had been used by the Duvalier regime to oppress the Haitian people. In 1996, Beauvoir founded The Temple of Yehwe, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit organization for the promotion of education concerning Afro-American religion. In 1997, he became involved with the creation of the KOSANBA group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In Port-au-Prince, Beauvoir died on Saturday, September 12, 2015, aged 79. Involvement with KNVA In 2005, he launched the , which he later renamed in 2008 as ; he serves as \\"chef Supreme\\" or \\"Ati Nasyonal\\" of the organization, which is an attempt to organize the defense of Vodou in the country against defamation.\\"Max Beauvoir, King, but of Grand Voodoo Priests, Ordinary Voodoo Priests\\" In media * Beauvoir was interviewed in 1982 by Canadian ethnobotanist Wade Davis for his 1985 book The Serpent and the Rainbow. * Beauvoir held a patent on the process of obtaining hecogenin from plant leaves until 1993..

Padmanabhan is despondent at the loss of his job. People in the village goad him to make life miserable for the new peon so that he would leave the job and go leaving the post vacant for Padmanabhan. Padmanabhan starts exhorting money from Sivasankaran. Sivasankaran, on the other hand, finds out that his job includes helping the Kavumpattu family in household chores. When he takes lunch for Kunju, she laughs at him and taunts him. In the meantime, Sivasankar stands up to Padmanabhan and refuses to give him any more of his money. Padmanabhan resorts to stealing coconuts from the Kavumpattu family estate to earn some money. Sivasankaran catches them and in the scuffle he is accused of being the thief.

The Pasha Centres are run by private entrepreneurs who have gone through the training program initiated by Kenya ICT Board. Prospective entrepreneurs who have undergone training are eligible to apply for a Pasha development loan from a revolving fund set up by the Kenya ICT Board. Pasha is a Swahili word meaning \\"to inform\\". The Pasha Project's key role is to provide Kenyans in rural areas with access to information across the country. Pasha Centre Logo Introduction Most of the ICT facilities in Kenya have been in urban areas, this has resulted in glaring disparities between urban and rural areas in the distribution of ICT facilities. To redress the disparities, the Kenya ICT Board has embarked on a Digital Villages project (DVP) under the Kenya Transparency Communications Infrastructure Project, which will see a creation of networks of information facilities across the country. Digital villages are centres that provide a suite of services to the public via computers connected to the internet, digital cameras, printers, fax machines and other communication infrastructure. The digital village project (DVP) is an integral part of an innovative public-private partnership (PPP) for taking ICTs to the rural communities in Kenya. DVP seeks to harness the vast untapped potential of the rural sector by making ICTs more accessible and affordable to the wider population through the development and utilisation of ICT facilities in the rural areas. The services to be provided by the Digital Villages will include government services; community-based services as well as a host of commercial services. Pasha is designed and facilitated by the Kenya ICT board in conjunction with key non-commercial partners. Eligibility criteria Eligible criteria to be a Pasha centre broadly will be: # The Centre should be an existing community centre # Should be providing services to the community currently, this service need not necessarily be in ICT related service. # The vision or strategies of the Centre should have synergy to the overall Pasha Project and Kenya ICT Board objectives and Vision. # Should have interest in becoming a Pasha Centre # Willingness to be a research centre for the Pasha project Selection criteria The Pasha centres are run by private entrepreneurs who obtain training in business and information technology from a certified training program. The training programs are run by the Kenya ICT Board. The provision of training programs in business and information technology from the certified programs will be supported by the DVP project. Prospective entrepreneurs who have obtained certification will be eligible to apply for a Pasha Development loan from a revolving fund set up by the Board. Role of Pasha Centres The Pasha Centres are designed to model a community- focused format that will be self-sufficient by using technology in the form of a Web 2.0 collaborative online platform for the Digital Village Pasha Program, led by the board. The role of the Pasha Centre is to provide Kenyans in rural areas with access to a world of information in a community-focused format that is self-sufficient: This will serve: * To enhance both their business skills and knowledge as well as expose them to world news and trends that may positively enhance their lives. * Provide employment for Kenyans both directly through economic activity that the centre will generate and secondarily through the opportunities that the information will provide. * Enhance provision of government services. Kenyans will be able to access government services such as NSSF statements, driving license application forms, police extracts among others, from the Pasha Centre. These services will all be online. Pasha Centres will ultimately open up cost-effective access to government and private services for remote farmers and entrepreneurs who would otherwise have to travel extensively to achieve this. About Kenya ICT Board The Kenya ICT Board was established by HE President Mwai Kibaki, as a state corporation under the State Corporations Act Cap. 446 on 19 February 2007. The achievement of an information-based society is one of the main priorities of the Government towards the realisation of national development goals and objectives for wealth and employment creation. ICT is one of the fastest growing sectors in the country. Harnessing of ICT will therefore help the Government to realise a number of its key public policy objectives. The objectives of the Kenya ICT Board include: To develop, launch and sustain a globally compelling brand marketing campaign for Kenya ICT, To develop and promote competitive ICT industries in Kenya, To develop world class Kenyan ICT institutions and To increase ICT access. Objectives of the Digital Villages Project The project has 3 main objectives: # Provide affordable access and use of ICT resources to rural communities in a sustainable way. # Increase connectivity of the rural areas to other parts of the country. # Create economic opportunities that will spur rural economic development. First Pasha Centre The first such centre was launched in July 2009 in Kangundo, Kenya. This being the first of six such planned launches all across the country by the Kenya ICT Board working in close partnership with Cisco Systems and The Copy Cat Limited. The other five locations are Malindi (Coast Province), South Imenti (Eastern Province), Garissa (North-Eastern Province), Siaya (Nyanza Province) and Mukuru Kiaba (Nairobi Province). Their purpose is to provide a four-month baseline study on community usage and their adaptation of the services offered. Such information is useful in determining the operational models for future Pasha Entrepreneurs and the portfolio of solutions to incorporate for each centre in the nationwide DVP roll-outs. Pasha models The pasha project has the following maturity models; Basic model # Basic office services # Internet surfing # Emailing Standard model # All of basic model # IT basic skills courses # IT face to face support # Access to government services Advanced model # All of standard model # Remote technical support # Wireless access to satellite \\"places\\" # Educational and vocational course training room # Health advice room Budgeting * Entrepreneur Training ‚Äì $2 million * Revolving Fund ‚Äì $4 million * IT Support ‚Äì $2 million * Bandwidth Support ‚Äì $2 million External links * Kenya ICT Board ‚Äì Home Page * Advanced Information Management (Dagoretti Digital Village) * newsroom.cisco.com ‚Äì Cisco News Brief * www.itweb.co.za ‚Äì Kenyan government opens first pilot Pasha Centre in Kangundo * www.pasha.co.ke ‚Äì Official Pasha Website Category:Communications in Kenya ","title":"Pasha Centre"},{"id":"25901447","text":"Jim Krenn (born 1959) is an American comedian and radio personality, best known for his work on The DVE Morning Show on WDVE in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 1988-December 6, 2011.

Known for most of its length as Raven Rock Road, the state highway runs from MD 64 in Smithsburg north to MD 550 in Fort Ritchie. The middle portion of MD 491 was constructed in the mid-1950s. The highway was extended south to Smithsburg along a partially new alignment in the early 1960s, replacing a road that had been designed MD 92 from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s. MD 491 was extended north toward Fort Ritchie in the late 1960s. Route description View south along MD 491 in Fort Ritchie MD 491 begins at an intersection with MD 64 (Smithsburg Pike) in Smithsburg. The state highway heads northeast as two-lane undivided Raven Rock Road, which flanks the western slope of South Mountain and parallels CSX's Hanover Subdivision. MD 491 veers east away from the railroad at Fruit Tree Drive and crosses Little Antietam Creek. The Appalachian Trail then crosses MD 491 approximately 1/2 mile further. The state highway follows the creek into Raven Rock Hollow, a gap in South Mountain between Buzzard Knob to the south and Raven Rock to the north. MD 491 follows the creek east and then northeast to an unnamed gap near Mt. Zion Road where the highway enters Frederick County. The state highway continues north to a four-way intersection next to the historic summer cottage Tipahato. From this intersection on the county line, Fort Ritchie heads east toward Sabillasville and Moyer Road heads north toward the communities of Highfield and Cascade. MD 491 turns west onto Macfee Hill Road into Washington County. The state highways descends to the site of the former U.S. Army installation Fort Ritchie within the community of Fort Ritchie, where the highway reaches its northern terminus at MD 550. MD 550 heads northeast as Military Road and northwest along Macfee Hill Road toward Pen Mar. History The predecessor state highway to MD 491 was MD 92, which was constructed in 1935. The state highway had its western terminus at the intersection of Water Street and Pennsylvania Avenue (originally MD 64, now MD 66) in Smithsburg. MD 92 ran east as Water Street and Fruit Tree Drive to near Fruit Tree Drive's modern intersection with MD 491 at the Western Maryland Railway crossing. MD 92 was rebuilt around 1944 as a military access project, as the state highway was part of the most direct route between Hagerstown and Fort Ritchie. MD 92 was transferred out of the state highway system in 1956. That same year, the original MD 491 in Charles County became part of an extended MD 425. Starting in a 1954, the portion of Raven Rock Road from Ritchie Road to the Frederick County line was reconstructed. This segment was designated MD 491 by 1957. The other sections of Raven Rock Road remained county highways. A new road was constructed east of the railroad between MD 64 (Smithsburg Bypass) and the present junction of MD 491 and Fruit Tree Drive in 1963. This new road and the portion of Raven Rock Road between Fruit Tree Drive and Ritchie Road became part of an extended MD 491. MD 491 was extended north from the Frederick County line north along Raven Rock Road and Royer Road to MD 550 in Highfield in 1968. The state highway achieved its present course when its northernmost segment was moved from Royer Road to Macfee Hill Road around 1981.

It refers to the areas around Sakae intersection, Sakae Station on the Nagoya Municipal Subway and Sakae Station on the Meitetsu Seto Line. Sakae is in the heart of Nagoya and is, along with Nagoya Station, one of Nagoya's main commercial districts.  Overview  Sakae district is formed around Sakae intersection Otsu-dori going north-south and Hirok≈çji-dori going east-west, It is the main shopping district of Nagoya, along with Nagoya Station and its immediate vicinity. Parallel to Otsu-dori is Hisaya-≈ådori; this road runs from Yaba-cho to Sakae except for Sotobori-dori, which is maintained as Hisaya ≈ådori Park. Popular events are held in this park on the weekend. Also, inside Hisaya-odori Park is the 180-meter Nagoya TV Tower, built in 1954, which is often mentioned as a symbol of Nagoya.\\"Sakae Nagoya\\" Asia rooms.com Accessed 14 May 2011.

Maruei Sakae, and Mitsukoshi are known as the 3M of Nagoya (or 4M if Meitetsu Department Store is included). Large shopping facilities such as Yaba-cho Parco, Nadya Park, and Lachic, among others, extend to the adjacent area known as Yaba-cho. In recent years, high- end luxury import brand stores as have been increasing along Otsu-dori, making it one of the country's foremost brand store areas. Along with those, the number of high-end furniture and home interior stores has been increasing. There is a Noritake branch here. At stations at each of these lines where they come together, the Higashiyama Line, under Hirokoji-dori running parallel to Nishiki-dori, and the Meij≈ç Line and Meitetsu Seto Line, under Hisaya-odori, have vast underground shopping areas, such as Sakae-Mori Underground Shopping Center (in Sakae Station), Sakae Chika (under Hirokoji-dori), and Central Park (under the northern section of Hisaya-Odori Park.) Under Hisaya-odori Park are huge, multistory parking areas such as Hisaya Municipal Parking Area and Angel Park.  Geography  Generally, what is known as Sakae was the area denoted before as Sakae Town, which had its center at Sakae Intersection. There are many places known as Sakae, such as Nishiki, Shin-sakae town, Higashi-ku Higashisakura, north of Sakae proper, and adjacent north of Nishiki, the south side of Marunouchi and one section of Higashi-ku Izumi. In this way, Sakae District has a wide range, encompassing many well-known places. There are areas also known by the names of streets like Hirokoji or Hisaya-odori. Sakae includes Nishiki 3-ch≈çme or \\"sankin,\\" a red light district. The area is divided into the North and South districts, in the same manner as Osaka. As for town names, in 1966 (year 41 of the Showa Era), the whole area encompassed by the Airport Line going east, Horikawa going west, Wakamiya-dori going south, Hirokoji going north was made to use the new address names Sakae 1-chome to Sakae 5-chome, destroying the old historical town names. For this reason, the Sakae 1-chome and Sakae 2-chome around Fushimi Station are Fushimi, Sakae 3-chome and Sakae 5-chome around Yaba-cho station are Yaba-cho, and are also known by these older names.

Houses were scattered around the area. At the Meiji Restoration, public offices (such as those of the prefectural government and the schools) as well as businesses (like traditional Japanese restaurants) were created. At the same time, a tram along Hirokoji-dori started running, expanding the town. In 1902 (year 35 of the Meiji Era), Hirokoji-dori road to Chikusa was made and greatly increased traffic to and from the eastern suburbs of Nagoya. In 1910 (year 43 of the Meiji Era) Ito Dry Goods (predecessor to the modern Matsuzakaya) transferred and started business. In 1915 (year 4 of the Taisho Era) Juichiya Department Store (predecessor to the modern Maruei) opened for business. Maruei traces its origins to 1615, but the store known as Maruei opened when Juichiya Department Store and another department store merged on August 27, 1943.(In Japanese) Accessed 14 May 2011. During the final period of World War II, for less than two years, the northern half of Naka Ward was established as Sakae Ward. After World War II, according to the postwar reconstruction plan, Hisaya-odori and Nishiki-dori, among others, were reconstructed. From the reconstruction of infrastructure such as parks, subways, and underground shopping areas, the Sakae area has developed greatly as Nagoya's central commercial area. In recent years, although places like Oasis 21 and Sakae Park continue to operate, development in the area of Nagoya Station has been remarkable, and Sakae is searching for a way to remain as the center of Nagoya. SKE48 and it's theater are based in this area.

Yazid ibn Abi Muslim was of the Arab tribe of Thaqif. He served in the administration of Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, the Umayyad governor of Wasit (Iraq). He rose in the ranks to become al-Hajjaj's secretary. During the illnesses that plagued al-Hajjaj's health before his death in 714, Yazid ibn Abi Muslim frequently stood in as his deputy. After al-Hajjaj's death, he was confirmed in that post by Caliph al- Walid I. When the Caliph Sulayman came to power in 715, Yazid ibn Abi Muslim was immediately dismissed (along with much of the rest of al-Hajjaj's appointees). It is said Yazid was imprisoned at that time, but subsequently released when no evidence of misconduct could be found to bring up charges. Another chronicle reports Yazid was only released c. 717 by the Caliph Omar II in an act of general clemency Ibn Khallikan, p.200 In 720, in the course of a new administrative sweep, Caliph Yazid II appointed Yazid ibn Abi Muslim as governor of Ifriqiya (North Africa), with supervisory authority over al- Andalus (Iberian Peninsula). Yazid ibn Abi Muslim's tenure in Ifriqiya was not a happy one. Perhaps recalling the brutish administration of his mentor al- Hajjaj in Wasit (Iraq), Yazid ibn Abi Muslim showed little respect for non- Arab Muslims under his jurisdiction. His predecessor in Kairouan, Ismail ibn Abd Allah ibn Abu al-Muhajjar had put much effort into integrating Muslim Berbers into the Caliphal mainstream. Yazid immediately went about undoing all that, relegating Berber officers and increasing fiscal exactions upon the Berber populace. Side-stepping the legal prohibitions, Yazid re-imposed the jizyah (non-Muslim poll taxes) on Muslim Berbers and expanded other extraordinary taxes and tributes. According to the chronicler Ibn Abd-el- Hakem, in 721, Yazid ibn Abi Muslim decided to humiliate the Berber guard of Kairouan by having their hands tattooed - - their personal names on their right hand, and the phrase \\"Guard of Yazid\\" on their left.Ibn Khaldun, p.357 The Berber guard decided that enough was enough, and killed Yazid ibn Abi Muslim. A previous governor, Muhammad ibn Yazid, was installed as temporary replacement, until a new governor was dispatched by Damascus. Ibn Khallikan (p. 202) asserts that the Berber guard was pardoned by Caliph Yazid II, upon receipt of the report of Yazid's abusive administration in Ifriqiya. Yazid II appointed Bishr ibn Safwan al-Kalbi as the new governor in late 721. However, Ibn Khaldun (p. 354), suggests that Abd-Allah ibn Musa, a son of former governor Musa ibn Nusair, might have been behind the plot of the Berber guard, and that the Caliph ordered Abd-Allah arrested and executed, which Bishr ibn Safwan reluctantly obeyed.

Wennberg is the R. Stanton Avery Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Environmental Science and Engineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He is the director of the Ronald and Maxine Linde Center for Global Environmental Science. He is chair of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network and a founding member of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory project, which created NASA's first spacecraft for analysis of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. He is also the principal investigator for the Mars Atmospheric Trace Molecule Occultation Spectrometer (MATMOS) to investigate trace gases in Mars's atmosphere. Wennberg's research focuses on the atmospheric chemistry of planets, including air quality, photochemistry, and the carbon cycle. He designs and builds remote-sensing and in-situ scientific instruments which are used in field investigations supported by the National Science Foundation and NASA. His scientific instruments have made it possible to measure radicals in the atmosphere at concentrations that could not previously be detected. He measures atmospheric trace gases, making it possible to accurately describe the exchange of carbon dioxide and other gases between the atmosphere and the land and ocean. His research has substantially advanced understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of the troposphere and the stratosphere. Education Paul Wennberg grew up in Waterbury Center, Vermont. He received a B.A. from Oberlin College in 1985, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1994. At Harvard, he worked with James G. Anderson, professor of atmospheric chemistry. His doctoral thesis was In Situ Measurements of Stratospheric Hydroxyl and Hydroperoxyl Radicals. Career Wennberg joined Caltech in 1998. He was an Associate Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Environmental Engineering Science from 1998 to 2001, becoming a full professor in 2001. In 2004, he was appointed as the R. Stanton Avery Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Environmental Science and Engineering. Wennberg has been associated with the Ronald and Maxine Linde Center for Global Environmental Science at Caltech since it was established in 2008. He served as the director from 2008 to 2011, acting director from 2012 to 2014 and director from 2014 onwards. Research While still at Harvard, Wennberg developed advanced airborne sensors to measure radicals in the atmosphere, in particular the odd-hydrogen radicals OH and HO2. The laser-induced fluorescence instrument that he developed was placed in the nose of a NASA ER-2 aircraft to measure radicals during flight. It has been used to measure radicals in both the troposphere and the stratosphere. Wennberg's sensor was used in several NASA missions, beginning with the SPADE mission in 1993. SPADE obtained the first simultaneous in situ measurements of OH, HO2, NO, NO2, ClO, and BrO from the lower stratosphere. The data were used to calculate ozone loss rates and showed that HOx dominated stratospheric ozone loss, a result that had not been previously observable. NASA's ASHOE/MAESA mission (1994) took measurements of HOx from latitudes of -70¬∞S to 70¬∞N, reaching nearly from the south pole to the north pole. The STRAT mission (1995-1996) was the first to record measurements of HOx in the upper troposphere, and demonstrated that the concentration of HOx considerably exceeded expected levels. The POLARIS mission in 1997 obtained measurements all the way to 90¬∞ N latitude, the North pole. As of 2004, Wennberg's instrument was modified for in situ measurements of water vapour and its Isotopologue HDO, and became the basis of the Harvard \\"Hoxotope\\". Since his move to Caltech, Wennberg has been deeply involved in two inter-related long-term instrumentation and data-collection projects: the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, and its ground-based counterpart, the Total Carbon Column Observing Network. Goals include better understanding of the carbon cycle, validation of data from space-based instruments, and establishing a standard for ground-based in situ networked data collection. In 2002, Wennberg was elected chair of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). In 2004, the first TCCON site was established. The Total Carbon Column Observing Network is a group of about 20 ground-based sites worldwide that host Fourier transform spectrometers. The spectrometers examine near- infrared (NIR) solar absorption spectra and measure atmospheric column abundances of CO2, CH4, CO, N2O and other molecules in terrestrial ecosystems. Data enables researchers to identify and study local carbon \\"sources\\" and \\"sinks\\", and by pooling data across the system, to better understand mechanisms of carbon exchange involving the atmosphere, the land, and the ocean. Data from the sites is used to understand carbon dynamics and to validate data from space-based measurements of atmospheric CO2 and CH4. Both terrestrial and atmospheric data are used to study carbon transfer within the atmosphere. Methane emissions from the Aliso Canyon gas leak were detected by TCCON within a day of the start of the leak. \\"TCCON has pioneered a key element of the ground segment measurements required to provide the evidence base for policy making for the next 100 years.\\" Wennberg is a founding member of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory and its successor, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2. The first satellite failed to separate from the Orbital Taurus XL rocket used as its launch vehicle on February 24, 2009 and was destroyed during reentry. The second satellite, a near duplicate, was launched successfully by NASA on July 2, 2014 using a ULA Delta II 7320-10C rocket. Spectrometers on the satellite can map the distribution of CO2 particles across the planet by measuring the average amount of CO2 above specific locations. Wennberg is the principal investigator for the development of the Mars Atmospheric Trace Molecule Occultation Spectrometer (MATMOS), a collaboration between Caltech and the Canadian Space Agency with NASA support. MATMOS will be flown on the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and take spectra of the sunlight through Mars' atmosphere as the spacecraft goes through its orbital sunrise and sunset. MATMOS will be able to measure trace gases in Mars's atmosphere at a concentrations of parts per trillion. Awards and honors Wennberg received a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) in 1999 from President Bill Clinton. He was named a MacArthur Foundation Fellow in 2002.

Nerri√®re's project differs from a controlled language of the same name devised by Madhukar Gogate six years earlier.  Usage  Jean-Paul Nerri√®re uses the term Globish for his subset of the English grammar and vocabulary. He claims that the language described in his books is naturally occurring. He has marked his codification of that language by taking out trademark protection on the term, as did I.A. Richards who trademarked Basic English in order to prevent dilution and misrepresentation of his work.Basic English and Its Uses, W.W. Norton, 1943 Instances of attested prior usage, it can be seen, were incidental or not intended for the same purpose. Jean-Paul Nerri√®re is a French computer engineer. Nerri√®re graduated with a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from √âcole Centrale de Paris in 1963. Then he entered the French Naval Academy, with further specialization in law, accounting and administration while serving as Supply Officer in the French Navy. He graduated from the French Advanced Defence College and advancing to the rank of commander. He joined IBM France in 1965 in the Data Processing Division. In IBM, he spent almost three decades with responsibilities in sales, marketing, and management in France as well as in international headquarters.Atlantico.fr: Jean-Paul Nerri√®re Biography of Jean-Paul Nerri√®re He became an Assistant to Corporate President John Opel, later on the Operations General Manager of IBM France, then a Vice President at IBM Europe, and eventually the IBM USA Vice President in charge of International Marketing. In 1992, Nerriere moved to Automobiles Peugeot as their Commercial Director and as Senior Vice President of sales, marketing, and services and a member of Peugeot's Council of Directors Council. Then he was appointed CEO of Digital Equipment France (DEC), and soon thereafter was promoted to Vice President of Digital Equipment Europe. Jean-Paul Nerri√®re was knighted in L√©gion d'honneur, the highest official award available in France. He is also an elected member of the French Maritime Society. He is also on the National Committee for the development of Grandes √âcoles.  Development  As an IBM executive and as a result of his vast travels, Jean-Paul Nerri√®re realized that a new global language was becoming more and more important. While serving as vice president of international marketing at IBM, Jean-Paul Nerriere first observed patterns of English that non-native English speakers used to communicate with each other in international conferences.McCrum, Robert: \\"So, what's this Globish revolution?\\" The Observer, December 3, 2006. In 1989, he proposed Globish as an international language focussing most of his efforts to its promotion. He developed rules and training in the form of various publications to help non-native English speakers better communicate with each other by using Globish as a lingua franca.\\"New lingua franca upsets French\\" BBC News, January 23, 2009. He conducted dozens of interviews and wrote or co-authored 6 books about Globish in four different languages.\\"Globish now the lingua franca of world travellers\\" The Australian, December 12, 2006. \\"Parlez vous Globish?

Promotion and publications  Nerri√®re formulated his ideas in two books he authored, Decouvrez le globish (meaning Discover the Globish) and Do Not Speak English, Parlez Globish.Oxford English Dictionary: The rise of global English Both books have been translated into a number of international languages. In French, he has published Parlez globish!: l'anglais plan√©taire du troisi√®me mill√©naire and co-authored with Philippe Dufresne and Jacques Bourgon, the instruction book D√©couvrez le globish: l'anglais all√©g√© en 26 √©tapes. Nerri√®re's 2004 codification work began to legitimize the language purpose to the extent it drew some press attention. Clearly, and with much subsequent reference, the term Globish has grown increasingly as a generic term since the date of his first publications. Nerri√®re trademarked Globish as a subset of the English language formalized by him.\\"Globish now the lingua franca of world travellers\\" The Australian, December 12, 2006. He also launched the website globish.com to promote his ideas. In 2009, intending to demonstrate that \\"Good Globish is correct English\\", Nerriere and David Hon published Globish the World Over, the first book written entirely in Globish- English. Robert McCrum, literary editor of The Observer, is quoted as supporting the efficacy of the language.http://www.globish.com By 2011, Globish the World Over had been translated into 12 languages including French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Polish, Hungarian, Slovakian, Uzbek etc.Globish official website It was a best seller in Japan. In 2011, the Globish Foundation was formed as a non-profit organization in Australia, for the purpose of maintaining and promulgating the standards of Globish. By 2013, the Globish Foundation had 8 national affiliates and an online Globish Communications Test available 24/7.http://www.globishfoundation.org Barbara Cassin claims that Globish is not a language of culture, but a language of service. Robert McCrum wrote the book Globish: How the English Language Became the World's Language (), describing Globish as an economic phenomenon, unlike \\"global English\\" whose uses are much more diverse than just business.  Related systems  Special English is also a controlled subset of the English language with about 1500 words, short sentences, and slower delivery than traditional English. Special English was first used on October 19, 1959, and is still presented daily by the United States broadcasting service Voice of America. Specialized English is a controlled subset of the English language derived from Special English by Feba Radio. It also has about 1500 words, with some differences in the word list from Special English.  Criticism  Critics of Globish either feel that its codifications are not sufficiently clearly rendered, or that an artificial language is preferable to any natural one. * Although Nerri√®re claims that the Globish described in his book is a natural language, he has never published any statistical evidence of his observations. Joachim Grzega, a German linguist, has even gone as far as to state \\"Obviously, it is not based on any empirical observations, neither on native‚Äìnon-native nor on non- native‚Äìnon-native discourse.\\"Globish and Basic Global English (BGE): Two Alternatives for a Rapid Acquisition of Communicative Competence in a Globalized World? by Dr Joaquin Grzega, a German linguist. * Globish is suspected of cultural imperialism, because it spreads only one language from which the subset of words is taken: this criticism is often by the speakers of other \\"neutral\\" languages, meant as languages not spoken in any nation. Clearly, derivative forms which have \\"English\\" in their titles are doubly suspect. According to CIA's The World Factbook, native English speakers represent only 4.68% of the world population,english version reported by the International Liaison Committee of Atheists and Freethinkers and the original French version of the same article, with sources including native and non- native speakers the total proportion of all English speakers is estimated to be 10‚Äì15%. * Globish is criticized for having an ulterior economic motive. It is a registered trademark and some marketing is done with it, since its owner did not renounce his rights to it (as for example L.L. Zamenhof did for Esperanto; on the other hand, I.A. Richards discussed why he trademarked Basic English, in order to prevent dilution and misrepresentation). *The Globish Text Scanner accepts some 2000 extra words.GLOBISH ? WHICH GLOBISH ?

He was tried at Carmarthen Assizes in 1920 and defended by Edward Marshall Hall; his case is a rare example of a legal professional being charged with murder. Facts Mabel Greenwood Harold Greenwood, a Yorkshire solicitor, moved to Wales in 1898 and he, his wife Mabel (n√©e Bowater), and their four children, lived comfortably, with domestic staff, in Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire. Mabel was not in good health and on 16 June 1919, complained of stomach pains after eating a gooseberry pie for lunch; \\"it always disagrees with me\\", she said. Greenwood gave her brandy, which caused her to vomit, and Dr Griffiths was summoned and dispensed medication. By the early hours of the 17th, however, she had died and the cause of death was certified by Griffiths as heart disease. Within a few months of her funeral, Greenwood married Gladys Jones, who was much younger than Mabel, causing much local gossip. Mabel had been an active and popular member of the local community and in October 1919 the gossip had reached such a level that the police proposed to exhume the body for forensic examination; when Greenwood was informed of this, he replied \\"Just the very thing ‚Äì I am quite agreeable\\". Mabel Greenwood's remains were examined and found to contain of arsenic, but no evidence of heart disease. Accordingly, an inquest was held in June 1920 at which the jury returned a unanimous verdict of \\"murder by arsenical poisoning ... administered by Harold Greenwood\\". The jury had been told that Greenwood had purchased weedkiller containing arsenic. Greenwood's comment on hearing the verdict was \\"Oh dear!\\", and he was arrested on 17 June 1920. Trial Greenwood's trial began on 2 November 1920 at Carmarthen Assizes before Mr Justice Shearman; he was prosecuted by Sir Edward Marlay Samson and defended by Sir Edward Marshall Hall. The case was Hall's third murder trial of the year, and he was already in poor health; however, he decided to accept the brief, despite doubts expressed by others, claiming \\"The man's innocent, and I'll get him off ‚Äì you'll see\\". Hall's defence of Greenwood hinged upon impugning the forensic evidence and that of a parlourmaid. In the former case, he showed that Dr Griffiths had himself given Mabel Greenwood medication (bismuth and morphine) at the time, which could be a cause of death independently of any arsenic, despite Griffiths' change of story from morphine to opium, then a much weaker drug; Hall seized upon this difference to maximum effect. In the case of Hannah Williams, the maid, Hall successfully showed that her evidence had been strongly influenced by a police officer who had interviewed her some time after the death, and that she had changed her story on several occasions. Hall opened his defence by quoting from Othello and alleging the whole case arose from local gossip. He called Greenwood as a witness in his own defence, who denied any involvement in his wife's death, and withstood lengthy cross-examination. His final witness was Irene Greenwood, the accused's 22-year-old daughter, who stated that she had also drunk, without ill effect, from the wine bottle alleged by the prosecution to have been the source of the poison that killed Mabel. The judge referred to this in his summing-up: \\"If she also drank from the bottle, there is an end of the case\\". Greenwood was acquitted and the jury added a rider (not published at the time) to their verdict, stating \\"We are satisfied ... that a dangerous dose of arsenic was administered to Mabel Greenwood ... but we are not satisfied that this was the immediate cause of death ... (nor) how or by whom the arsenic was administered\\". Greenwood, with his second wife, moved to Sellack, near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, changed his name to Pilkington, and lived an uneventful life until his death in 1929.

It was his debut novel and was published by Night Shade Books on September 1, 2009. The novel is set in a future Thailand and covers a number of contemporary issues such as global warming and biotechnology. The Windup Girl was named as the ninth best fiction book of 2009 by TIME magazine. It won the 2010 Nebula Award and the 2010 Hugo Award (tied with The City & the City by China Mi√©ville), both for best novel. The book also won the 2010 Campbell Memorial Award, the 2010 Compton Crook Award and the 2010 Locus Award for best first novel. Setting The Windup Girl is set in 23rd-century Thailand. Global warming has raised the levels of world's oceans, carbon fuel sources have become depleted, and manually wound springs are used as energy storage devices. Biotechnology is dominant and megacorporations (called calorie companies) like AgriGen, PurCal and RedStar control food production through 'genehacked' seeds, and use bioterrorism, private armies and economic hitmen to create markets for their products. Frequent catastrophes, such as deadly and widespread plagues and illness, caused by genetically modified crops and mutant pests, ravage entire populations. The natural genetic seed stock of the world's plants has been almost completely supplanted by those that are genetically engineered to be sterile, forcing farmers to buy new seeds from the calorie companies every season. Thailand is an exception. It maintains its own reserve of genetically viable seeds, fights off engineered plagues and other bioterrorism, and keeps its borders firmly closed against the calorie companies and other foreign biological imports. The capital city of Bangkok is below sea level and is protected from flooding by levees and pumps. The current monarch of Thailand is a child queen who is essentially a figurehead; the three most powerful people in Thailand are the Somdet Chaopraya (regent for the child queen), General Pracha (the chief of the Environment Ministry), and Minister Akkarat (the chief of the Trade Ministry). Pracha and Akkarat are longtime enemies, and represent the protectionist/independent/isolationist and internationalist/accommodationalist factions in the government, respectively. Plot summary Anderson Lake is an economic hitman for the AgriGen Corporation, working in Thailand. He owns a factory trying to mass-produce a revolutionary new model of kink-spring (the successor, in the absence of oil or petroleum, to the internal combustion engine) that will store gigajoules of energy. But the factory is a cover for his real mission: discovering the location of the Thai seedbank, with which Thailand has so far managed to resist the calorie companies' attempts at agro-economic subjugation. He has heavily delegated the running of the factory to his Chinese manager, Hock Seng, a refugee from the Malaysian purge of the ethnic Chinese. Hock Seng was a successful businessman in his former life and he plots steal the kink-spring designs kept in Anderson's safe. When Emiko, an illegal Japanese \\"windup\\" (genetically modified human) girl stuck in bonded servitude in a sex club, reveals Anderson information she has learned about the secret seedbank, he in return tells her about a refuge in the north of Thailand where people of Emiko's kind (the \\"New People\\") live together. From then on, she becomes determined to escape to this place by paying off Raleigh, the club's owner. Meanwhile, Jaidee Rojjanasukchai, a zealous and honest captain of the White shirts (the armed, enforcement wing of the Environment Ministry, which is charged with preventing illegal imports, unauthorized energy use, and the incursions of bio-engineered viruses), intercepts and destroys a dirigible containing a great amount of illegal contraband. Anderson and others in the foreign trading community (known as \\"farangs\\") pressure Akkarat to make Jaidee back off. To make him fall in line, they kidnap Jaidee's wife. When he learns of this, he submits and is sentenced to nine years in a monastery. Later, realizing that his wife will never be returned to him and has likely been murdered, he escapes and is caught and killed while trying to assassinate Akkarat. The other White shirts declare him a martyr and rise up against the Trade Ministry. At the same time, Hock Seng learns that factory workers are falling victim to a new plague originating from the kink-spring factory. He has the bodies disposed of surreptitiously. As the White shirts take control of Bangkok, he escapes from the factory into hiding. Anderson discovers Hock Seng's flight and also goes into hiding Jaidee's replacement (and former prot√©g√©), Kanya, discovers the new plague and sets about trying to contain it while dealing with guilt of being Akkarat's mole and betraying Jaidee. She reluctantly seeks help from Gibbons, the scientist at the heart of the Thai seedbank, who is revealed to be a renegade AgriGen scientist. He identifies the new plague and gives clues to Kanya that lead her to Anderson's factory. Anderson meets with Akkarat and the Somdet Chaopraya, who is the regent to the young Thai Queen and the most powerful person in all of Thailand. Anderson offers to supply a new strain of GM rice and a private army from AgriGen to repel the White shirts in exchange for access to the seedbank and lowering of the trade barriers. To seal the deal, knowing of the Somdet Chaopraya's addiction to sexual novelty, he takes him to Emiko's club. When the Somdet Chaopraya and his entourage later sexually humiliate and degrade her, Emiko snaps and kills them. She escapes and seeks refuge with Anderson. Akkarat accuses General Pracha of orchestrating the Somdet Chaopraya's assassination and uses this as a pretext for to fight Pracha and the White shirts. The capital is plunged into civil war. Having failed to steal the kink-spring designs, Hock Seng tries to capture Emiko for ransom. However, Anderson makes a deal with him: Hock Seng would be patronized by AgriGen and Emiko would remain with Anderson. In short order, Pracha and most of the top Environment Ministry men are killed. Akkarat, now all-powerful, appoints his spy Kanya as the new chief of the Environment Ministry. He also opens up Thailand to the calorie companies, and grants Anderson and AgriGen access to the seedbank. Kanya, accompanies the \\"calorie men\\" to the seedbank, where she reneges and executes the AgriGen team. She then directs the seedbank's monks to move the seeds to a pre-arranged secure location. With the hidden military arsenal in the seedbank, she orchestrates the destruction of the levees around Bangkok, flooding it. Bangkok's people and the capital relocate to the site of Ayutthaya. Akkarat is stripped of his powers and sentenced to servitude as a monk. Anderson dies of the plague originating from his factory while he is in hiding with Emiko. Emiko is found by Gibbons, who promises that he will use Emiko's DNA to engineer a new race of fertile New People, thus fulfilling her dream of living with her own kind. Awards and honors In September 2010, the novel won the 2010 Hugo Award for Best Novel category, tying with China Mi√©ville's The City & the City. In May 2010, the novel won the Nebula Award for Best Novel. In 2010, the novel won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.

Kri≈æaj was born in Kopriva on the Karst Plateau, then part of the Austro-Hungarian county of Gorizia and Gradisca. After World War I, the region became part of the Kingdom of Italy and Kri≈æaj became an Italian citizen. Already at a young age he showed a passion for flight, which led him to pursue a pilot's course at the royal officer school in Capua near Naples, Italy. Due to his Slovene ethnic origins, he was not allowed into the regular Italian Royal Air Force, but he was nevertheless granted a place in the reserves. Because of the physical hardships endured during the training and his pro-Slovenian and pro-Yugoslav national political stance, he flew a Fiat AS.1 airplane on 25 June 1932 from Udine to Ljubljana, crossing the border of Yugoslavia, which led to much media interest. In 1934, he became a Yugoslav citizen. Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he joined the Yugoslav volunteers that fought on the side of the Spanish Republic. He was a member of the Squadron Espa√±a, and was shot down once and captured during the war. After his return to Yugoslavia, he moved to Serbia, where he lived during World War II. After the war, he became a SFR Yugoslav Air Force military pilot. His life ended on 8 October 1948, when his aircraft, a Yakovlev Yak-3, crashed into Mount Sne≈ænik in southwestern Slovenia because of poor visibility in dense fog. Today, the Ajdov≈°ƒçina Flying Club is named after Josip Kri≈æaj, and there is a monument to him at Portoro≈æ Airport.

The village was created by Koon Pandiyan (Tamil: ‡Æï‡ØÇ‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æ©‡Øç), a Pandiya King, created the village as a military base on the banks of Gundar River, a distributary of River Vaigai. During an earlier period, the village was known as Sengol Padai (Tamil: ‡Æö‡ØÜ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Øã‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Æü‡Øà), (English: Military of Throne) which later became Sengapadai. Geography Sengapadai is located in Tamil Nadu on the banks of Gundar River, a distributary of river Vaigai. The average elevation of Sengapadai is . This village forms a panchayat and falls under the administrative control of the district of Madurai, the taluk of Thirumangalam, and the panchayat union of Kallikudi, with a postal code of 625704 and an STD code of 04549. History Koon Pandiyan established a military base on the banks of Gundar River, and this place was called Sengol Padai. Later, it came to be known as Sengappadai. This is the popular knowledge in the village. This village is not mentioned in Tamil literature, however, there are two old temples in the village which speak to its history. The temple in the west is Sennakesava Perumal Koil and the one in the east is Sidhi Vinayakar Koil which was constructed in the era of Pandiya kings. The earliest Vinayaka temple, at the centre of the village, was defaced by the Malik Kafur invasion; this temple is known as Mottai Pillaiyar Koil, due to its broken head. Demographics , Sengapadai had a population of 3,712: 1,859 males and 1.853 females. Sengapadai had an average literacy rate of 65%, higher than the national average of 63.5%. 10% of the population was under 6 years of age. According to the 2011 census, Sengapadai population increased to 3,924 with 1,977 males and 1,947 females. The literacy rate also increased, to 69%. Educational facilities This village has educational facilities up to Higher Secondary level. The schools that are available to village children are, * Panchayat Union PreKG school * Panchayat Union Primary school (Grade: 1 to 5) * CSI Primary School (Grade: 1 to 5) * Government Higher Secondary School (Grades 6 to 12) There has been a drastic increase in the literacy rate in recent years. Language Tamil is spoken predominantly in Sengapadai. Religion At the moment, all residents in this village are Hindus. However, in the past, there were Christian missionaries in the village. Many Hindu Temples are located throughout the village. Production=Agriculture Almost all the lands within Sengapadai's geographical limits are cultivatable. Nearly 60% of families are farmers. Cotton is the main product, but farmers also produce grains, nuts, cattle feed, sun flower seeds and many vegetables. Paddy is not produced as there is no storage pond available, which is necessary for flood irrigation of the paddy crop. Weaving Nearly 5% of families weave cloth, mainly cotton, on handlooms. Service The portion of the population that are not farmers, are engaged in government- or privately-owned services. In 2009‚Äì10, under the Anna Marumalarchi Thittam, a state-funded development project, a library was created in a new building and contains thousand of books on history, literature, fiction and other subjects. Two public bathing cubicles for men were constructed under a panchayat project in the year 2008‚Äì09. Bathing rooms for women have not yet been built. Poultry and dairy farms A few poultry farms produce eggs and chickens. Dairy farms supply barely-sufficient milk for local consumption. Industry There are no industries in Sengapadai. The Government of Tamil Nadu plans to establish a SIDCO (Small Industries) Complex. However, this development was heavily opposed by the local farmers in 2008 because it could result in the loss of many trees and agricultural activities. Solar Power Kamuthi Solar Power Project - A 648 MW solar power station was inaugurated in 2016https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Adani%E2%80%99s-648-MW- solar-plant-inaugurated/article14993341.ece Living standards Many villagers are in the middle income group; almost all are above the poverty level. Still there are concepts of Castism among the older generation. The village has excellent water distribution and a drainage network, but sanitation facilities are poor. Waste management has to be implemented by the Government. Items such as plastic, glass and metals are dumped along with biodegradable wastes in the farming lands. This severely affects the yields from these lands. The few private clinics are run by Paramedics. Postal, telegraphy, telephone and Internet services There is a village post office in Sengapadai, which also serves the nearby villages in collecting and distributing. Families have wired telephone and internet facilities provided by BSNL, and almost all young people own a cell phone. Transport=Road Sengapadai is connected by paved roads in the south (towards Villur), east (towards Karisalkalampatti, Sivarakottai and Kalligudi), west (towards T. Pudupatti) and north (towards Madurai). The primary traffic lies to Thirumangalam and Madurai. State government-operated buses are the main source of transportation for most people. Apart from city buses, three- wheeled, black and yellow auto-rickshaws, referred to as autos, are used to reach this village from Thirumangalam.

Furthermore, metamaterials are an advance in materials science. Hence, those metamaterials that are designed to be absorbers offer benefits over conventional absorbers such as further miniaturization, wider adaptability, and increased effectiveness. Intended applications for the metamaterial absorber include emitters, photodetectors, sensors, spatial light modulators, infrared camouflage, wireless communication, and use in solar photovoltaics and thermophotovoltaics. For practical applications, the metamaterial absorbers can be divided into two types: narrow band and broadband. For example, metamaterial absorbers can be used to improve the performance of photodetectors. Metamaterial absorbers can also be used for enhancing absorption in both solar photovoltaic and thermo- photovoltaic applications. Skin depth engineering can be used in metamaterial absorbers in photovoltaic applications as well as other optoelectronic devices, where optimizing the device performance demands minimizing resistive losses and power consumption, such as photodetectors, laser diodes, and light emitting diodes. In addition, the advent of metamaterial absorbers enable researchers to further understand the theory of metamaterials which is derived from classical electromagnetic wave theory. This leads to understanding the material's capabilities and reasons for current limitations. Unfortunately, achieving broadband absorption, especially in the THz region (and higher frequencies), still remains a challenging task because of the intrinsically narrow bandwidth of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) or localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) generated on metallic surfaces at the nanoscale, which are exploited as a mechanism to obtain perfect absorption. Metamaterials Metamaterials are artificial materials which exhibit unique properties which do not occur in nature. These are usually arrays of structures which are smaller than the wavelength they interact with. These structures have the capability to control electromagnetic radiation in unique ways that are not exhibited by conventional materials. It is the spacing and shape of a given metamaterial's components that define its use and the way it controls electromagnetic radiation. Unlike most conventional materials, researchers in this field can physically control electromagnetic radiation by altering the geometry of the material's components. Metamaterial structures are used in a wide range of applications and across a broad frequency range from radio frequencies, to microwave, terahertz, across the infrared spectrum and almost to visible wavelengths. Absorbers \\"An electromagnetic absorber neither reflects nor transmits the incident radiation. Therefore, the power of the impinging wave is mostly absorbed in the absorber materials. The performance of an absorber depends on its thickness and morphology, and also the materials used to fabricate it.\\" \\"A near unity absorber is a device in which all incident radiation is absorbed at the operating frequency‚Äìtransmissivity, reflectivity, scattering and all other light propagation channels are disabled. Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbers can be categorized into two types: resonant absorbers and broadband absorbers. Principal conceptions A metamaterial absorber utilizes the effective medium design of metamaterials and the loss components of permittivity and magnetic permeability to create a material that has a high ratio of electromagnetic radiation absorption. Loss is noted in applications of negative refractive index (photonic metamaterials, antenna systems metamaterials) or transformation optics (metamaterial cloaking, celestial mechanics), but is typically undesired in these applications. Complex permittivity and permeability are derived from metamaterials using the effective medium approach. As effective media, metamaterials can be characterized with complex Œµ(w) = Œµ1 \\\\+ iŒµ2 for effective permittivity and ¬µ(w) = ¬µ1 \\\\+ i ¬µ2 for effective permeability. Complex values of permittivity and permeability typically correspond to attenuation in a medium. Most of the work in metamaterials is focused on the real parts of these parameters, which relate to wave propagation rather than attenuation. The loss (imaginary) components are small in comparison to the real parts and are often neglected in such cases. However, the loss terms (Œµ2 and ¬µ2) can also be engineered to create high attenuation and correspondingly large absorption. By independently manipulating resonances in Œµ and ¬µ it is possible to absorb both the incident electric and magnetic field. Additionally, a metamaterial can be impedance- matched to free space by engineering its permittivity and permeability, minimizing reflectivity. Thus, it becomes a highly capable absorber. This approach can be used to create thin absorbers. Typical conventional absorbers are thick compared to wavelengths of interest, which is a problem in many applications. Since metamaterials are characterized based on their subwavelength nature, they can be used to create effective yet thin absorbers. This is not limited to electromagnetic absorption either. The effective absorber has to be wave-matched with the absorber medium when reflection is minimal and the energy flow inside of it is maximum. Simultaneously, a depth of absorbing layer inside of the absorber has to contain many wave-lengths when wave looses its energy gradually. To fulfill the requirements partly, special techniques are applied as the quarter-wave matching, optical coating, impedance matching and others. Found theoretical and experimental decisions give appropriate results for 20-th century. Only 155 years later after Fresnel's formulas deduction, Sergei P. Efimov from Bauman Moscow State Technical University found parameters of anisotropic medium i. e. of non- reflecting crystal, when absolute wave-matching is achieved for all frequencies and all incidence angles. Two concepts- negative-index metamaterial found by Victor G. Veselago from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and non-reflecting crystal were both pure theoretical achievements of electrodynamics and acoustics nearly 30 years unless the epoch of metamaterials came at last.

Efimov used fundamental property of Maxwell's equations. If to change scale of Z-axis: Z'=Z/K, i. e. to compress medium with Œµ=1 for half-space Z>0, then Maxwell's equations go to those for macroscopic medium. Permittivity Œµz of it along axis Z is equal to K when transverse that Œµtr is equal to 1/K. Magnetic permeability along axis Z Œºz is equal to K and transverse that is equal to 1/K. Straight calculation of reflection index gives zero at all angles and all frequencies naturally. It is good present from Maxwell's equations for the absorption metamaterial designers. At the same time, it is very important that the compression coefficient K can be negative and complex even. Analogous transformation can be applied for acoustics what gives the non-negative crystal as a theoretical concept. As a result, wave-length in the metamaterial is K times less than in empty space. Therefore, thickness of absorption layer can be K times less.

The extant written sources are limited and largely from a non-Spartan viewpoint. Anton Powell writes that to say that the written sources are \\"'not without problems'... as an understatement would be hard to beat\\". Sources Sparta is one of only three states in ancient Greece, along with Athens and Gortyn, for which any detailed information about the role of women survives. This evidence is mostly from the classical period and later, but many of the laws and customs we know of probably date back to the archaic period. The earliest evidence about the lives of Spartan women come from archaic Greek poetry, such as the (\\"maiden songs\\") of Alcman, a Lydian poet who lived and worked in Sparta in the seventh century BC. However, the literary sources which give us the most information about women's lives in Sparta are later and written exclusively by non- Spartans. Xenophon‚Äôs Constitution of the Lacedaemonians is another major source for Spartan history. Xenophon was born in Athens but worked as a mercenary in Sparta. His literary work discussed many details about Spartan customs and practices. Plutarch‚Äôs Life of Lycurgus is also a major source for information about Spartan history, particularly on Lycurgus. He described the marriage ritual of Spartans as well as the eugenic policies Lycurgus enacted in the Spartan Constitution. These policies were believed to result in the strongest possible children and thus they would strengthen the Spartan military. Non-literary sources, including archaeology and ancient art, are limited. Aristotle was an Athenian citizen who saw fall of Sparta within his lifetime. He wrote Politics, which is the main source on Sparta from Aristotle that survives today, and the Constitution of Sparta which has been lost. Aristotle criticized the Spartan state primarily for the power that their women owned more over property and men. Childhood left to die. This painting by Giuseppe Diotti shows a baby being judged. It is unclear whether girl children also suffered this treatment. According to Plutarch's testimony, Spartans practiced infanticide as a matter of course if children were thought to be unhealthy. It is unclear from this passage whether this applied to girls as well as boys, though evidence from elsewhere in Plutarch and Xenophon implies that it does not. It is likely that girls were simply given into the care of their mothers immediately after birth. There is not enough evidence, however, to say whether this was the case throughout Spartan history. Female Spartan babies were as well fed as their male counterparts ‚Äì in contrast to Athens, where boys were better fed than girls ‚Äì in order to have physically fit women to carry children and give birth. Education Information about the education of Spartan women is hard to find as there are more surviving sources about the education of Spartan boys. In Sparta, boys were educated in the agoge from the age of seven, at least for some periods of Spartan history. It is likely that whenever the state arranged for the education of boys, it also institutionalised for the education of girls. Unlike their male counterparts, Spartan girls would have been raised at home with their mothers while undergoing their education. They would learn about the duties and responsibilities of looking after the home, largely because the males of the household were often away. There is evidence for some form of official educational programme for girls as early as the archaic period, and this system seems to have been discontinued in the Hellenistic period. The extent to which education for girls was restored under the reforms of Cleomenes III is unclear, but it may have become voluntary rather than compulsory. State-supervised education for girls was, once again, abolished in 188 BC, and restored in the Roman period. Young Spartans Exercising by Edgar Degas, . Literacy was, in Sparta, a skill limited to the elite. However, there is evidence from the Classical period that some women could read. For instance, anecdotes about Sparta are preserved which feature mothers writing letters to their sons who were away. A reference by Aristophanes to a Spartan woman poet, Cleitagora, and the Spartan Pythagoreans listed by Iamblichos, suggest that some Spartan women may have been highly literate. As well as reading and writing, women studied mousike - which consisted of not just music, but also dance and poetry. Women seem to have learned to play musical instruments, as shown in surviving statuettes. Mousike was an important part of Spartan religious activity, particularly as part of the cults of Helen and Artemis. Spartan girls danced in choruses made up of girls of similar ages, and they were led by an older girl (chorƒìgos), and trained by a professional poet. Along with training in song and dance, these choruses educated girls in ritual and cultic activity. Dance also provided physical benefits: in Aristophanes' Lysistrata, the Spartan character Lampito attributes her fitness to the Laconian dance known as the bibasis, which involved buttock kicks and leaps. Finally, the songs to which the girls danced provided an opportunity to inculcate them with Spartan values and gender roles. Athletics Spartan bronze figure of a running girl, wearing a single-shouldered chiton (British Museum) Unlike elsewhere in Greece, in Sparta, unmarried girls regularly participated in sports. The Spartan exercise regimen for girls was designed to make them \\"every bit as fit as their brothers\\", though unlike their brothers they did not actually train for combat. In his Constitution of the Spartans, Xenophon reports that Lycurgus required that women should exercise just as much as men, and to this end instituted athletic competitions for women. Early sources report that Spartan girls practiced running and wrestling; later texts also mention throwing the javelin and discus, boxing, and pankration. They also learned to ride on horseback. There are votive offerings that have been discovered depicting Spartan women on horseback. It is possible that Spartan girls exercised naked, because Archaic Spartan art portrays naked girls, unlike the art of other areas of Greece. Girls might have competed in gymnopaedia, the Spartan festival of naked youths. They also competed in running races for various festivals, of which the most prestigious was the Heraean Games. Upon marrying, Spartan women likely ceased participating in athletics. Marriage Spartan women seem to have married relatively late in comparison to their counterparts elsewhere in Greece. While Athenian women might have expected to marry for the first time around the age of fourteen to men much older than them, Spartan women normally married between the ages of eighteen and twenty to men close to them in age. Spartan men under the age of thirty were not permitted to live with their wives, instead they were expected to live communally with other members of their syssitia. Due to the husband's absence, women were expected to run the household largely alone. Unlike in Athens, where state ideology held that men were in charge of the household, Sue Blundell argues that in Sparta it is likely that women's control of the domestic sphere was accepted, and possibly even encouraged, by the state. According to Spartan ideology, the primary role of adult women was to bear and raise healthy children. This focus on childbearing was likely responsible for the emphasis on physical fitness in Spartan women, as it was believed that physically stronger women would have healthier children. Before marriage, there was a trial period for the potential couple to ensure that they could have children; if they could not, divorce and remarriage was the customary solution. For Spartans, all activities involving marriage revolved around the single purpose of producing strong children and thus improving their military. Spartan marriages could also be arranged based on one's wealth and status. The evidence for the role of kyrioi (male guardians) in arranging Spartan women's marriages is not decisive, though Cartledge believes that, like their Athenian (and unlike their Gortynian) counterparts, it was the responsibility of the kyrios to arrange a Spartan woman's marriage. There is some evidence in ancient sources that the Spartans practiced polyandry. Herodotus says that the bigamy of Anaxandridas II, who married a second wife because his first had not been able to produce an heir, was un-Spartan,Herodotus, Histories, V.40.2 but Polybius wrote that it was common at his time, and a time-honoured practice.Polybius XII.6b.8 Andrew Scott suggests that polygyny would have been more common in ancient Sparta in the early 4th century BC, when the number of Spartan citizen men sharply decreased. Along with plural marriage, Xenophon states that older men with younger wives were encouraged to allow younger, more fit men impregnate their wives, in order to produce stronger children. Further, Polybius claims that when a man had enough children, it was a Spartan custom for him to give his wife to another man so that he too might have children. Marriage ritual On the night of the wedding, the bride would have her hair cut short and be dressed in a man's cloak and sandals. The bride appeared dressed like a man or a young boy to be perceived as less threatening to her husband. The bride was then left alone in a darkened room, where she would be visited and ritually captured by her new husband.Plutarch, Life of Lycurgus 15.3-4. Men were expected to visit their new wives at night and in secret. The purpose of this was to make it more difficult for new couples to consummate their marriage, which was thought to increase the desire between husband and wife, and lead to the creation of stronger children. Matriarchal duties Spartan women enforced the state ideology of militarism and bravery. Plutarch relates that one woman, upon handing her son his shield, instructed him to come home \\"either with this, or on it\\".Plutarch, Moralia, 241 Because Spartan men spent much of their time living in barracks or at war, Spartan women were expected to run the household themselves. Unlike in Athens, where state ideology held that men were in charge of the household, Sue Blundell argues that in Sparta it is likely that women's control of the domestic sphere was accepted by the state. Due to this Aristotle was critical of Sparta, and claimed that men were ruled by strong and independent women, unlike in the rest of Greece.Aristotle, Politics 1269b. Aristotle also criticised Spartan women for their wealth. He attributed the state's precipitous fall from being the master of Greece to a second-rate power in less than 50 years, to the fact that Sparta had become a gynocracy whose women were intemperate and loved luxury.Aristotle, Politics 1269b-1270a. All Spartan women, not just the richest, would have taken advantage of helot labour to perform the domestic tasks that elsewhere in Greece would have fallen to free women. Activities such as weaving, which were considered women's work elsewhere in Greece, were not considered fit for free women in Sparta. Therefore, women were more preoccupied with governance, agriculture, logistics and other sustenance tasks. Spartan law codified under Lycurgus expressed the importance of child-bearing to Sparta. Bearing and raising children was considered the most important role for women in Spartan society, equal to male warriors in the Spartan army. Spartan women were encouraged to produce many children, preferably male, to increase Sparta's military population. They took pride in having borne and raised brave warriors. Having sons who were cowards, however, was a cause for sorrow, and the ancient author Aelian claims that women whose sons died as cowards lamented this. By contrast, the female relatives of the Spartans who died heroically in the Battle of Leuctra were said to have walked around in public looking happy. Spartan women did not simply celebrate their sons who had shown bravery, and mourn when they had not, they were crucial in enforcing social consequences for cowardly men. When Pausanias, a traitor to Sparta, took refuge in a sanctuary to Athena, his mother Theano is said to have taken a brick and placed it in the doorway. Following this example, the Spartans bricked up the temple door with Pausanias inside. Similarly, Pomeroy cites three of Plutarch's Sayings of Spartan Women which tell of Spartan mothers killing their cowardly sons themselves. Female homoeroticism in Sparta Alcman‚Äôs Partheneia or ‚Äòmaiden song‚Äô was among the first documents discovered to express homoerotic sentiments between women. This was performed as choral hymns by young women in Sparta, and the piece was probably commissioned by the state to be performed publicly. Alcman‚Äôs poem has a verse where the younger choral girls admire their older choral leaders who invoke admiration and also inspires these erotic sentiments. The women describe the way that eros (sexual desire) for their choral leaders has taken over their bodies. Religion In ancient Sparta, cults for women reflected Spartan society's emphasis on the women's roles as child-bearers and raisers. Consequently, cults focused on fertility, women's health, and beauty. The cult of Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, was an important cult for Spartan women. Also important was the cult of Helen, with many objects used by women - mirrors, eye-liners, combs, and perfume bottles, for instance - dedicated at her cult sites. As well as two major cult sites, a shrine to Helen was located in the center of Sparta, and many steles featuring her were carved and displayed throughout the city. Cynisca, the first woman to win an Olympic victory, also had a cult in Sparta, the \\"only woman on record\\" to have been thus commemorated. Plutarch writes, in his Life of Lycurgus, that only men who died in battle and women who died while holding a religious office should have their name inscribed on their tombstone.Plutarch, Life of Lycurgus, 27.3 This would be consistent with the Spartan reputation for piety, though one translation (Latte) emended the manuscript to read instead that women who died in childbirth would have named memorials, a reading which has become popular among many scholars. This emendation however has lacked archaeological, literary, or epigraph evidence to support it, whereas the two surviving funerary inscriptions for Spartan women lend credence to Plutarch's original claim that these honors were only extended to those women who died while holding religious office. Spartan society was slavishly structured around the obligation of all citizens to contribute to the state, and the failure to do so garnered no acclaim; in the starkest terms, Spartan women who died in childbirth could be seen as having made no contribution to the state in their attempt, and therefore were not accorded any special status for their death. Sparta did, however, place particular emphasis on religion, arguably more than any other Greek city state, and therefore it was women who died in the service of the state, by worshiping Sparta's deities, who were honored with inscribed tombstones. Clothing The Dorian peplos, worn by Spartan women, was fastened at the shoulder with pins called fibulae. These examples date to the archaic period and were discovered at the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia, one of Sparta's most important religious sites. Spartan women's clothing was simple and notoriously short. They wore the Dorian peplos, with slit skirts which bared their thighs. The Dorian peplos was made of a heavier woolen material than was common in Ionia, and was fastened at the shoulder by pins called fibulae. When running races, Spartan girls wore a distinctive single- shouldered, knee-length chiton. Since women did not weave their own clothes and instead left the creation of goods to the perioikoi, the purchase of elaborate cloth, and of metal bracelets, was a sign of wealth. It is unknown whether women wore these silver and gold bracelets at all times or if only for religious ceremonies and festivals. Lycurgus was said to have forbidden women from using cosmetics. Young women grew their hair long and did not cover it, but married women were not allowed to wear their hair long, and covered their heads with veils. Other women in Sparta As in other places in ancient Greece, in Sparta far more is known about the elites than the lower classes, and ancient sources do not discuss gender in relation to the non-Spartans who lived in Sparta. Along with Spartan citizens, various groups of free non- Spartiates lived in Sparta, as did helots and, at least later in Spartan history, personal slaves. According to Xenophon, Spartan women were not required to do the domestic labour which women elsewhere in the Greek world were responsible for. He reports that in Sparta, doulai (slave women) did the weaving. In archaic Sparta, it would have been helot women who fulfilled this role, but later in Spartan history, especially after the emancipation of the Messenian helots, many of these women were likely personal slaves. Women in perioicic communities were presumably responsible for the domestic labour for their own household, just as women were elsewhere in the Greek world. Plutarch says in his Life of Lycurgus that due to the lack of money in ancient Sparta, and because of the strict moral regime instituted by Lycurgus, there was no prostitution in Sparta. Later on, when gold and silver was more available, prostitution seemed to have surfaced. By the Hellenistic period, the geographer Polemon of Athens reported that he had seen bronze statues in Sparta dedicated by the prostitute Cottina, and there was a brothel named for her near the temple of Dionysos. Spartan nurses were famous throughout Greece, and wealthy families from across Greece had their children nursed by Spartans. Plutarch reports that Alcibiades was nursed by a Spartan woman called Amycla.Plutarch, Alcibiades 1.2 The status of these nurses is not clear - they were probably not helots, who would not have been sold to foreigners, but could have been some other form of non-citizen women from Laconia. Unlike other slaves in ancient Greece, the helot population was maintained through reproduction, rather than the purchase of more slaves. Because of this, helots were able to freely choose partners, and live in family groups, whereas other Greek slaves were kept in single-sex dormitories. Along with relationships with helot men, some helot women seem to have had children with Spartan men. These children were called mothakes, and were apparently free and able to gain citizenship - according to Aelian, the admiral Lysander was a mothax. The main purpose of mothakes from a Spartan point of view was that they could fight in the Spartan army, and Sarah Pomeroy suggests that daughters of Spartan men and helot women would therefore have been killed at birth.

A similar path called the Greenway covers the Northern Outfall Sewer. History The Sewers were installed after an outbreak of cholera in 1853 and the \\"Great Stink\\" of 1858. Development The Greenwich end of the Ridgeway was refurbished in 2010 and the Bexley end of the Ridgeway was refurbished in 2017. The Plumstead entrance to the Ridgeway was also refurbished in 2018, with public art work installed by local artist Sam Skinner and Ninth Seal. The Ridgeway is incorporated in to the Thamesmead 5K and family 1 mile runs organised by the Thamesmead running club and Peabody. A petition was created by local users of the Ridgeway for litter bins to be installed along its entire length. The petition was rejected by Greenwich council in January 2018. There is a Facebook group and Twitter page for Ridgeway Users. Future proposals There is an option to extend the new steam railway planned for South London from Crossness car park to Plumstead railway station via the Ridgeway. At the western end of the Ridgeway, the housing association Peabody Trust have applied to build 930 homes adjacent to Plumstead bus garage. Improvements to existing public spaces around the development will include improvements to pathways that pass the Ridgeway. Proposals have been put forward by the Pharaoh Project to create a 'biodome' within the underpass at Pettman Crescent adjacent to the Plumstead entrance of the Ridgeway.

Hardy (May 14, 1918 ‚Äì February 19, 2003) was a United States surgeon who performed the world's first lung transplant with patient John Russell living for 18 days. The transplant was performed at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi on June 11, 1963. Hardy also performed the world's first modern heart transplant attempt when he transplanted the heart of a chimpanzee into comatose and dying Boyd Rush's chest during the early morning of January 24, 1964. This heart beat for approximately one hour, and then Rush died without ever regaining consciousness. The consent form did not include the possibility that a chimpanzee heart may be used, although Hardy stated that he had included this in discussions with Rush's stepsister. Before the transplant attempt, Hardy asked the four doctors who would be assisting him to please vote about whether to proceed. One said yes, one abstained, and the last two nodded yes. This operation was also performed at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi. This was also the world's first modern heart xenotransplant since Hardy used a chimp's heart. Early life Hardy grew up in Newala, Alabama, a small community in Shelby County. His father owned a lime plant in Newala. He studied at a high school in Montevallo before entering the University of Alabama for pre-medical curriculum. He received his MD in 1942 from University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia. He held the office of the president of Alpha Omega Alpha during his senior year and his first scientific publication was on wound healings. Career Hardy served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps in early 1944 during the Second World War. He first worked at Stark General Hospital, Charleston in South Carolina. Hardy began writing his first book, Surgery and the Endocrine System, in 1950 which was published two years later. He was awarded the Master of Medical Science in physiological chemistry by the University of Pennsylvania in 1951 for his research on using heavy water for measuring body fluids. He became the chair of surgery at the University of Mississippi School of Medicine, Jackson in 1955. He was also the first Professor of Surgery at the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. Hardy wrote 24 books, 139 book chapters, 466 papers, and produced over 200 films. Vishnevsky Institute, Moscow honored him in 1971 for his pioneering work in organ transplantation and awarded him two medals for lung transplant and heart, respectively. He has served as President of the Society of University Surgeons, the Society of Surgical Chairmen, the Southern Surgical Association, the American College of Surgeons, the American Surgical Association and the International Society of Surgery. Hardy also led the team responsible for performing a double-lung transplant that left the heart in place, in 1987. First lung transplant (1963) In April 1963, 58-year-old John Russell was admitted to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi, with recurrent pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics.Lung Homotransplantation in Man: Report of the Initial Case, JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association), James D. Hardy, MD; Watts R. Webb, MD; Martin L. Dalton Jr., MD; George R. Walker Jr., MD, 1963;186(12):1065-1074 Dec. 21, 1963. See also Lung Transplantation in same issue. He also had emphysema of both lungs, squamous cell carcinoma of his left lung, and kidney disease. To complicate matters, Russell was a prisoner at the Mississippi State Penitentiary serving a life sentence for murder. One source states Russell was in prison for accidentally shooting and killing a 14-year-old boy. James Hardy wrote in the article regarding this case, \\"Although the patient was serving a life sentence for a capital offense, there was no discussion with him regarding the possibility of a change in his prison sentence. However, authorities of the state government were contacted privately, and they indicated that a very favorable attitude might be adopted if the patient were to contribute to human progress in this way.\\"Lung Transplantation: Principles and Practice, edited by Wickii T. Vigneswaran, Edward R. Garrity, Jr., John A. Odell, \\"Ch. 3 Ethical considerations in transplantation,\\" Baddr A. Shaksheer, Sean C. Wightman, Savitri Fedson, Mark Siegler, CRC Press, 2015, page 23. Prior to the surgery, Russell would awake at night coughing up bloody sputum until he was blue in the face. Every movement left him extremely short of breath, and he was scared of suffocating. Tests showed he only had one-third of normal lung capacity. When Hardy approached him about the potential transplant, Russell talked with his wife and three children. His main concern was whether the transplant would help improve his shortness of breath. Hardy told him that he thought it would. Thoracic resident Martin Dalton sought and received permission from the family to use the left lung of a recently deceased heart attack patient. He used an endotracheal tube to keep the lungs ventilated and injected heparin into the heart to prevent clotting. When the time came, he removed the left lung and carried it to the adjourning operating room. On June 11, 1963, when Hardy and his team first opened up Russell's chest to begin the transplant, they saw that his cancer had spread beyond the left lung. The transplant would not save his life from the cancer. However, it might give him better breathing. The team continued with the planned transplant of the left lung. The cancerous left lung had shrunk, and so had the space around it. The team made space for the new lung and changed a few of the planned vascular connections. Watts Webb assisted Hardy with the transplant.Second Wind: Oral Histories of Lung Transplant Survivors, Mary Jo Festle, Palgrave MacMillan, 2012. \\" . . they also saw that the cancer had spread beyond the left lung. Now it was certain that neither removing nor replacing the lung would save Russell for an extended life. . \\" Initially, the transplanted lung did provide Russell with better breathing, and then kidney disease started to get the best of him. Hardy used azathioprine, prednisone, as well as radiation to suppress his immune system. John Russell lived for another 18 days and then died of kidney failure.Anesthesia for Transplant Surgery, Jayashree Sood, Vijay Vohra, New Delhi, London, Panama City, Philadelphia: Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishing, 2014, page 4, \\"Lung Transplant.\\"Dr. James D.

The book Second Wind: Oral Histories of Lung Transplant Survivors (2012) states that University of Mississippi Medical Center had unreliable blood banking, no intensive care unit, only limited 24-hour lab support, a weak anesthesia program, and most critically for Russell, no artificial kidney machine.

It's also known that Boyd was 'white' (European-American) and that he was living in the Laurel Trailer Park on the outskirts of Jackson, Mississippi. Rush's stepsister Mrs. J.H.

There was also a trauma victim in the hospital's ICU who was brain-dead and whose family had given permission for him to be a heart donor.

Around 11:00 pm on Thursday, Jan. 23, Rush went into shock with low blood pressure, and Hardy took him into the operating room. Rush's heart stopped just before they attached him to the heart-lung machine. Hardy polled the other four doctors who were assisting him in the surgery about regarding whether they should continue with the transplant knowing that they would now use the heart of one of the chimpanzees and would likely receive substantial public criticism.

This is a human interest piece about two nurses, Joyce Caracci and Ruby Winters, who were involved in the 1964 heart transplant into patient Boyd Rush. The hospital's director of public information put out a very guarded statement which included the vague statement \\"the dimensions of the only available donor heart\\" and did not disclose that the donor heart was that of a chimpanzee.Every Second Counts, McRae, page 126. See similar information in Xenotransplantation: Law and Ethics, McLean, Williamson, page 51. The Associated Press widely distributed a story which began with, \\"Surgeons took the heart from a dead man, revived it and transplanted it into the chest of a man dying of heart failure today.\\"\\"Substitute Heart Works for an Hour in Historic Surgery,\\" Utica Daily Press [New York], Dudley Lehew, Jackson, Miss. (AP), Saturday morning edition, Jan. 25, 1964, front page (bottom of page).Every Second Counts, McRae, page 126, top. At that point, the Mississippi Medical Center revealed details including that the donor heart had been that of a chimpanzee. On Jan. 25, the New York Times printed a more accurate headline: \\"Chimpanzee Heart Used in Transplant to Human.\\" Years later, Hardy stated, \\"The publicity, the outcry and the criticism were enormous. Public media reporters seemed to come out of the woodwork. We hunkered down and waited it out.\\"Every Second Counts, McRae, page 126, bottom. Several weeks later Hardy attended the Sixth International Transplantation Conference in New York City. Author Donald McRae of Every Second Counts (2006) wrote that the publicity surrounding the transplant had made Hardy's work \\"seem chaotic and even duplicitous\\" and that Hardy could feel the \\"icy disdain\\" from his fellow physicians. Hardy was introduced by Willem Kolff, the creator of the kidney machine, and toward the end of introduction Kolff turned to Hardy and quipped, \\"In Mississippi they keep the chimpanzees in one cage and the Negroes in another cage, don't they, Dr. Hardy?\\" Donald McRae wrote that the impact of this offhand remark on an already unsympathetic audience was profound, especially since the audience knew that Kolff had lived through the Nazi occupation of Holland. Kolff said later that he had merely been joking in an effort to lighten the mood. Hardy wrote, \\"For one of the few times in my professional career, I was taken aback and did poorly. The audience was palpably hostile. . . . . there was not a single hand of applause thereafter.\\"Every Second Counts, McRae, page 127 top.Strange But True, America: Weird Tales from All 50 States, John Hafnor, illustrated by Dale Crawford, Lone Pine Productions, 2009. page 64. Hardy later wrote, \\"I had noted that when one loses his academic post, for whatever reason, he is not likely to get another one of comparable significance. I decided to wait until [Norm] Shumway and his group transplanted a heart in man.\\" James Hardy thereby withdrew from the race to perform the first successful heart transplant.Every Second Counts, McRae, page 127. More than three and a half years later, the first heart transplantation with a human heart was performed by Christiaan Barnard of South Africa on Dec. 3, 1967, with patient Louis Washkansky surviving for eighteen days. Personal life Hardy married Louise Scott Sams of Decatur, Georgia in 1949; they met when he was working in Stark General Hospital in Charleston. She died from Alzheimer's disease in 2000. They had four daughters ‚Äì Dr. Louise Roeska-Hardy, professor of philosophy in Heidelberg and Frankfurt, Germany, Dr. Julia Ann Hardy, psychiatrist in Michigan, Dr. Bettie Winn Hardy, clinical psychologist and director of the eating disorders program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas and Dr. Katherine H.

Retirement Hardy retired from the Department of Surgery, University of Mississippi School of Medicine, Jackson, in 1987. He died at the age of 84 on February 19, 2003. Books Hardy wrote an autobiography, The World of Surgery 1945‚Äì1985: Memoirs of One Participant, which was published in 1986.

Background  During the last years of the Safavid dynasty in Iran, Ottomans were able to annex most of Caucasus and west Iran, due to hereditary strife, civil unrest and total chaos. Meanwhile, Afghans were able to annex a part of Khorasan. The shah had to appoint Nadir, an Iranian Afshar TurkomanEncyclop√¶dia Britannica warlord, as his commander in chief.

Nadir Shah was planning to found another great Persian empire, stretching from the Indus to the Bosphorus, like in ancient times. After reconquering former territories of Iran, he further tried to annex the eastern territories of the Ottoman Empire (East Anatolia and Iraq). He also proposed to reconcile the two sects (mazhab) of Islam. (Ottomans were of Sunni faith and most of Iranians were of Shia faith.)

It is located on the river Snov. A few buildings belonging to the Kamenka Assumption Monastery still stand in the village.  History  Initially the settlement was called Podmonastyrskaya Slobodka (, meaning free settlement close to a monastery). It was situated next to Kamenka Assumption Monastery. The monastery was founded in 1687 and initially was male. In 1764 it was abandoned, but in 1786 restored as a female monastery. Kamenka Assumption monastery was closed, by the decision of Bryansk Governorate Executive Committee from October 15, 1928. Eventually a start was made on disassembling the stone building and the fence of the monastery for building needs. After the war, the surviving buildings of the monastery housed an orphanage. In 1954 there was a fire in the orphanage.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –º–æ–Ω–∞—Å—Ç—ã—Ä—è, –ë—Ä—è–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –∫—Ä–∞–π.

Biography  Hern√°ndez del Portillo was born in Gibraltar during the Spanish period. He was a member of the Gibraltar City Council and held responsibilities over the supply of food to the city () during the late 16th and early 17th century. Between 1605 and 1610 he wrote his most notable work, Historia de la Muy Noble y M√°s Leal Ciudad de Gibraltar (), the first written history of Gibraltar. The work was later reviewed by himself between 1615 and 1622. The manuscript of the chronicle was kept in the archives of Algeciras and was one of the sources of the work History of Gibraltar by Spanish historian Ignacio L√≥pez de Ayala in 1792, one of the canonical works of the Spanish historiography about Gibraltar.  Work  Hern√°ndez del Portillo chronicles the history of his city from its origins, which he set to be in the times of the Libyan and Ancient Greek Heracles (as a symbol of the Phoenician and Ancient Greek colonisation of the Iberian Peninsula), to his days. It also includes many legendary stories and almost lacks any information about the Moor period. The main value of his work is in his account of the facts he witnessed at first hand, a period not well known in the history of Gibraltar. His accounts made the 16th century people, industry, port, commercial, fishing and agricultural activities of Gibraltar known. The Historia de la Muy Noble y M√°s Leal Ciudad de Gibraltar has been published in recent times by the Spanish historian Antonio Torremocha, a specialist in the history of the Campo de Gibraltar. The first edition, titled Historias de Gibraltar (), was published in 1994 ().Record of Historias de Gibraltar in the Ministry of Culture of Spain A second edition, revised and expanded, was published in 2008, under the title History of Gibraltar (). This second edition is the first issue of the collection Fuentes para la Historia del Campo de Gibraltar (). Torremocha defines Portillo as a Renaissance Man.

In 2009 GNI in EU-27 fell by ‚àí5.5% over the year 2008. In 2007, the highest per capita GNI measured in purchasing power standards (PPS) was recorded for Luxembourg (more than twice of the EU-27 average) and the lowest was recorded for Bulgaria (less than half of the EU-27 average). Estonia, Ireland, Latvia and Lithuania were the Member States that in 2009 suffered the most from the recession experiencing declines of more than 10% in GNI (measured in PPS) over 2008.Data extracted from Eurostat's database -> Data Navigation Tree -> Database -> Economy and Finance -> National Accounts (including GDP) (na) -> Annual national accounts (nama) -> Income, saving and net lending / net borrowing (nama_inc) on 8 February 2010 Definition of GNI GNI is defined in accordance with the European system of national and regional accounts. GNI represents total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (interest, dividends and reinvested earnings from foreign direct investment receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income.Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) 1287/2003 of 15 July 2003 on the harmonisation of gross national income at market prices, Article 1(3) It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus primary income payable by resident units to non-resident units, plus primary income receivable by resident units from the rest of the world.F. Lequiller, D. Blades: Understanding National Accounts, Paris: OECD 2006, p. 411 Technically speaking, the GNI is a balancing item of the allocation of primary income account in the sequence of accounts for the total economy.Eurostat: European system of accounts (ESA 1995), Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 1996, p. 306 Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as \\"holding gains and losses\\") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI). Net national income differs from gross national income by the amount of consumption of fixed capital deducted. GNI and the EU budget More than three quarters of the revenue of the budget of the European Union is based on the member states' contributions calculated as a uniform percentage rate applied to the sum of all the member states' GNIs.Council Decision (EC,Euratom) 2007/436 of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities‚Äô own resources, Article 2(1c)European Commission: EU budget 2010 ‚Äì Paving the way for economic recovery, Luxembourg: Publication Office of the European Union, 2009 The GNI-based own resource is governed by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) 1287/2003 of 15 July 2003 on the harmonisation of gross national income at market prices (the GNI regulation), which lays downs the definition and calculation of GNI. The GNI regulation also specifies the provisions for the notification of the data and related methodological information by the member states to the European Commission (Eurostat). Furthermore, the GNI regulation establishes the procedures to facilitate the verification of the GNI base for own resources, and, where necessary, the improvement of the comparability, reliability and exhaustiveness of the member states' GNI estimates. Eurostat validates the data calculated and transmitted by the member states.L.

A.) Johnson (June 11, 1947 ‚Äì January 21, 2010) was an American film and music producer, director, and editor best known for his long association with musician Neil Young. Early life Born in Ft. Benning, Georgia to a military family, this self-described \\"military brat\\" attended Peekskill Military Academy and Rutgers University. While at Peekskill Military Academy, his creative skills and \\"good ear\\" for music were well respected. He served as a band leader and drum major. Johnson became involved in filmmaking in the late 1960s and was originally one of the East Coast guerilla documentary filmmakers that emerged in that era. Part of a New York scene that also included Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, L.M. Kit Carson and others, they brought a street-wise sensibility and engaged political bent to their work that reflected the turbulent era of the late Sixties. Johnson's lengthy career includes stints as producer, director, editor, sound recordist, cinematographer, and production manager. Among fellow staff like Thelma Schoomaker, Jeanne Field, and Bob Meurice at Paradigm Films, Johnson worked as an assistant to Paradigm Films founders John Binder and Michael Wadleigh in 1969. Beginning his career as a sound recordist, he was nominated for an Academy Award in 1971 for Best Sound for his location recording, mixing and sound design on the feature documentary, Woodstock and also was involved as an assistant to director Michael Wadleigh. Of his role in the production of Woodstock, one source claims Johnson as having \\"embodied the soul of Woodstock more than any other of the film crew people.\\" In 1972, Marjoe, an expos√© of the evangelist-con man Marjoe Gortner, was released in which Johnson was the sound recordist. Frequently teamed with veteran cameraman David Myers, in the early 1970s Johnson was frequently associated with TVTV, a band of renegade documentarians who brought a fresh sensibility to the conventions of television documentaries and their work appeared on PBS and gained much critical respect. Working with Neil Young L.A. Johnson and Neil Young first crossed paths at Woodstock in 1969 where Young, who was performing as part of Crosby, Stills & Nash, refused to be filmed (although there is footage on Young's \\"Archives\\" of Young and Stills playing the slower, original arrangement of \\"Mr. Soul\\" on acoustic guitars). Johnson and cameraman David Meyers were recruited by CSNY to film their residence at the Fillmore East in 1970 for a never-completed concert film. 1971 saw Frederic Underhill and Johnson produce Neil Young's film Journey Through the Past, which incorporated some of the CSNY 1970 footage and was the beginning of his long association with Neil Young. He received producer credit for the soundtrack LP. In 1978, Johnson re-united with Young for Young's concert film, Rust Never Sleeps, and was also producer of Young's feature film, the eccentric \\"nuclear comedy\\", Human Highway featuring Young, Dennis Hopper, Dean Stockwell, Russ Tamblyn and Sally Kirkland, which was released in 1982. His continued association with Young also found him producing the 1984 Solo Trans LaserDisc/VHS directed by Hal Ashby and directing Young's 1986 Cow Palace concert \\"Live From a Rusted-Out Garage\\" for Pay Per View. This little-seen broadcast was a successor of sorts to Young's fabled Rust Never Sleeps but it is Johnson's majestic sweeping camera gliding over the audience combined with the ferocious performance of a pumped-up Young that makes this arguably the single greatest video document of Neil Young and Crazy Horse. As head of Young's film production company, Shakey Pictures, Johnson has produced Young's concert videos, Weld, Year of the Horse, Neil Young: Silver and Gold, and Neil Young: Red Rocks Live, directing the latter two as well. Johnson continued working with Young on his many projects including the long-awaited The Archives and was co-producer of Young's ambitious concept album Greendale (2003). Described by Young as a \\"musical novel,\\" it was a series of songs depicting a small-town California family caught up in the post-9/11 world, as they struggle to maintain their way of life during a time of social and political upheaval. Reminiscent of David Lynch's Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, with the Devil lurking in the shadows, Johnson helped Young craft the multi- layered backstories for the song's characters and the record and ensuing film remain one of the singer-songwriters greatest accomplishments. Johnson also produced the accompanying movie, directed by Young, and oversaw the two-year Greendale tour, a rock concert-cum-Broadway musical hybrid that was an astonishing realization of the concept. Recently, both a comic book and a play based on the concept album have been reputed to be in the works. Johnson also co-produced Young's 2006 protest album, Living with War and served as in-house video director on many of Young's tours, including the CSNY \\"Freedom of Speech\\" tour, which drew heavily from Young's anti-war album. While producing videos for the Living with War website, Young and Johnson became acquainted with \\"Nightline\\" correspondent Michael Cerre, who provided stories of his experiences as a correspondent in Iraq. Cerre and Young began to craft a narrative that would incorporate footage of soldiers in Iraq intercut with concert footage of the tour. Johnson produced the feature, which garnered Young his strongest reviews as a filmmaker. Writing for The Huffington Post website, Evan Handler opined, \\"I feel strange saying it, but \\"CSNY/D√©j√† Vu\\" might just be the most important film to come out of the 2008 Sundance festival. Not due to any great filmmaking innovation (though I do think it's a good movie), but due to the simple choice by director Neil Young (working under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey) to make the film's focus not so much his and his bandmates' outspokenness in opposition to the Bush administration and the war in Iraq, but the reactions that outspokenness provoked in their audiences and the press.\\" The film was also accepted at the Berlin Festival. It opened in American theatres in July 2008 and received further praise for its emotional power, with the Los Angeles Times saying, \\"Though it may be another in a long line of choir-preaching, anti-Iraq war documentaries, \\"CSNY/D√©j√† Vu,\\" Neil Young's effective hybrid of concert film and political snapshot, is one of the shrewdest and most entertaining of the bunch....Recent and archival interview, news, war and music footage, which often juxtapose the Vietnam and Iraq conflicts, round out this unflinching, well-constructed picture,\\" while Richard Roeper gave it a thumbs up on \\"At the Movies\\", calling it, \\"A good, strong documentary....(Young) is a brilliant artist;‚Äù and Steven Rea of \\"The Philadelphia Inquirer\\" wrote, \\"as Young ‚Äì er, Shakey ‚Äì shifts the focus from himself and his bandmates to several of these veterans, the film achieves a level of unexpected power and poignancy.\\" Johnson was heavily involved in both the video and physical production of the two decade gestation of Young's The Archives Vol. 1 1963-1972 and was credited as the producer when released in June 2009. lincvolt Johnson continued to work with Young on his latest film project, a documentary about converting older gas-guzzling automobiles into fuel-efficient, low emission, environment-friendly vehicles titled, \\"Linc-Volt\\". Other projects Returning to the rock scene in 1975, Johnson handled sound recording on Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Review fantasia, Renaldo & Clara, and was a line producer for the legendary The Last Waltz concert and film. In the 1980s, Johnson turned to directing concert videos for various musicians including Joni Mitchell's \\"Shadows and Light\\", Belinda Carlisle's \\"Live in Concert\\", New Edition's \\"Past & Present\\", and Bobby Brown's \\"My Prerogative\\". He also directed music videos, including the popular jingoist anthem, \\"God Bless the U.S.A.\\" by country singer Lee Greenwood. 1993 saw the release of a different kind of music video for Johnson, \\"Lean by Jarre,‚Äù a symphonic performance by the Oscar-winning film composer Maurice Jarre, whose long collaboration with director David Lean was the basis for the concert video. With clips from such Lean film classics as Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, the home video release was a testament to the unforgettable contribution of Jarre's scores to Lean's later films as well confirmation that Johnson was a master of the in-concert form, be it classical or popular and it remains a career highlight. In 1995 Johnson produced and directed the innovative Forrest Gump: Music and the Times CD-ROM featuring songs from the Academy Award-winning film's soundtrack and interviews with the recording artists including reunions of the members of The Byrds and Buffalo Springfield. He also worked outside of his involvement with Neil Young, often utilizing the talents of his son, Ben, an acclaimed director/cameraman in his own right. Though perhaps not well known to the public at large, L.A. Johnson was widely respected by his peers in both the film and music communities. Twice married and divorced to music contractor Leslie Morris, he was father to a son, Ben (b. 1982) and a daughter, Hannah (b. 1984). An avid fisherman, he named his production company Upstream Productions, and lived on a boat in the Bay Area.

His influence on New Zealand literature and identity grew in the years after his death. He is best known for his novel Man Alone (1939). Life Gifted both academically and athletically, his New Zealand secondary education was at Wellington College (1925‚Äì27) and Auckland Grammar School (1927-29). Mulgan studied at Auckland University College (1930‚Äì32), before attending Merton College, Oxford from November 1933. He was awarded a first in English in 1935, and in July 1935 took up a position at the Clarendon Press. Mulgan held leftish political views and was alarmed by the rise of fascism in Europe and the response of the British government to it. In 1936, he was an observer for the New Zealand government at the League of Nations in Geneva. During this time, he wrote a series of articles on foreign affairs, titled \\"Behind the Cables\\", for the Auckland Star newspaper. His view that war in Europe was inevitable led Mulgan to join the Territorial Army in 1938, and he was made second lieutenant in an infantry regiment. Posted to the Middle East in 1942, Mulgan was promoted to major and made second-in-command of his regiment. He saw action at El Alamein and fought alongside the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. He was impressed by the calibre of his compatriots and found meeting New Zealanders after being in England for so long to be a kind of \\"homecoming\\". He left the Royal West Kents Regiment after reporting his last Colonel as quite incompetent. In 1943, Mulgan joined the Special Operations Executive and was sent to Greece to coordinate guerilla action against the German forces. He was awarded the Military Cross for his actions. After the German withdrawal in 1944, Mulgan oversaw British compensation to Greek families who had helped the Allied forces. In the evening of Anzac Day 1945, Mulgan intentionally took an overdose of morphine. Speculation continues as to why he committed suicide. He is buried at Heliopolis military cemetery in Cairo. Mulgan was survived by his wife Gabrielle (married 1937) and son Richard (born 1940).

But he made himself especially valuable as a writer of comedies. His play poetry exists of: *Amarillis, play with a happy ending, Amsterdam, 1693. *Hardersspel.

The style in all these plays is natural, loose and flowing, but some of the expressions are a bit rude, which caused them to no longer being played. He also knew, when needed by the subject, to express himself forcefully. Furthermore, he has left us a work in manuscript form which was, together with the drawings for the illustrations, completely ready for publishing; it was found in the rich collection of books by Lower Dutch poets owned by C.P.E. Robid√© van der Aa, and is titled: A. Alewyns Simmebeelden, bestaande in 22 prenten, door den schrijver uitgevonden, wijders door denselven met vaarzen en zedekundige redeneeringen op yder prent toepasselijk verrijkt, en verders gestoffeerd met veele aanmerkelijke en gedenkwaardige aloude geschiedenissen en zinspreuken, uit aanzienlijke geloofwaardige schrijvers en zedeleeraars getrokken, zijnde de prenten in koper gesneden door Pieter van Bergen.

The last sentence seems to indicate that only the death of Alewijn prevented the publication, as he had even already hired an engraver. The prose in this work shows the writer's great knowledge of literature, fun and ingeniosity, while the verses beneath each illustration, each time figuring monkeys as the protagonists, are not unworthy witnesses of his poetic capabilities.

MET is the reverse process of epithelial‚Äìmesenchymal transition (EMT) and it has been shown to occur in normal development, induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming, cancer metastasis and wound healing. __TOC__  Introduction  Unlike epithelial cells ‚Äì which are stationary and characterized by an apico- basal polarity with binding by a basal lamina, tight junctions, gap junctions, adherent junctions and expression of cell-cell adhesion markers such as E-cadherin, mesenchymal cells do not make mature cell-cell contacts, can invade through the extracellular matrix, and express markers such as vimentin, fibronectin, N-cadherin, Twist, and Snail. MET plays also a critical role in metabolic switching and epigenetic modifications. In general epithelium- associated genes are upregulated and mesenchyme-associated genes are downregulated in the process of MET. In development 455x455px During embryogenesis and early development, cells switch back and forth between different cellular phenotypes via MET and its reverse process, epithelial‚Äìmesenchymal transition (EMT). Developmental METs have been studied most extensively in embryogenesis during somitogenesis and nephrogenesis and carcinogenesis during metastasis, but it also occurs in cardiogenesis or foregut development. MET is an essential process in embryogenesis to gather mesenchymal-like cells into cohesive structures. Although the mechanism of MET during various organs morphogenesis is quite similar, each process has a unique signaling pathway to induce changes in gene expression profiles. Nephrogenesis One example of this, the most well described of the developmental METs, is kidney ontogenesis. The mammalian kidney is primarily formed by two early structures: the ureteric bud and the nephrogenic mesenchyme, which form the collecting duct and nephrons respectively (see kidney development for more details). During kidney ontogenesis, a reciprocal induction of the ureteric bud epithelium and nephrogenic mesenchyme occurs. As the ureteric bud grows out of the Wolffian duct, the nephrogenic mesenchyme induces the ureteric bud to branch. Concurrently, the ureteric bud induces the nephrogenic mesenchyme to condense around the bud and undergo MET to form the renal epithelium, which ultimately forms the nephron. Growth factors, integrins, cell adhesion molecules, and protooncogenes, such as c-ret, c-ros, and c-met, mediate the reciprocal induction in metanephrons and consequent MET. Somitogenesis Another example of developmental MET occurs during somitogenesis. Vertebrate somites, the precursors of axial bones and trunk skeletal muscles, are formed by the maturation of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). The PSM, which is composed of mesenchymal cells, undergoes segmentation by delineating somite boundaries (see somitogenesis for more details). Each somite is encapsulated by an epithelium, formerly mesenchymal cells that had undergone MET. Two Rho family GTPases ‚Äì Cdc42 and Rac1 ‚Äì as well as the transcription factor Paraxis are required for chick somitic MET. Cardiogenesis  Development of heart is involved in several rounds of EMT and MET. While development splanchnopleure undergo EMT and produce endothelial progenitors, these then form the endocardium through MET. Pericardium is formed by sinus venosus mesenchymal cells that undergo MET. Quite similar processes occur also while regeneration in the injured heart. Injured pericardium undergoes EMT and is transformed into adipocytes or myofibroblasts which induce arrhythmia and scars. MET than leads to the formation of vascular and epithelial progenitors that can differentiate into vasculogenic cells which lead to regeneration of heart injury. Hepatogenesis=In cancer 384x384px While relatively little is known about the role MET plays in cancer when compared to the extensive studies of EMT in tumor metastasis, MET is believed to participate in the establishment and stabilization of distant metastases by allowing cancerous cells to regain epithelial properties and integrate into distant organs. Between these two states, cells occur in 'intermediate‚Äêstate', or so‚Äêcalled partial EMT. In recent years, researchers have begun to investigate MET as one of many potential therapeutic targets in the prevention of metastases. This approach to preventing metastasis is known as differentiation-based therapy or differentiation therapy and it can be used for development of new anti-cancer therapeutic strategies. In iPS cell reprogramming A number of different cellular processes must take place in order for somatic cells to undergo reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). iPS cell reprogramming, also known as somatic cell reprogramming, can be achieved by ectopic expression of Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc (OKSM). Upon induction, mouse fibroblasts must undergo MET to successfully begin the initiation phase of reprogramming. Epithelial- associated genes such as E-cadherin/Cdh1, Cldns ‚àí3, ‚àí4, ‚àí7, ‚àí11, Occludin (Ocln), Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Epcam), and Crumbs homolog 3 (Crb3), were all upregulated before Nanog, a key transcription factor in maintaining pluripotency, was turned on. Additionally, mesenchymal-associated genes such as Snail, Slug, Zeb ‚àí1, ‚àí2, and N-cadherin were downregulated within the first 5 days post-OKSM induction. Addition of exogenous TGF-Œ≤1, which blocks MET, decreased iPS reprogramming efficiency significantly. These findings are all consistent with previous observations that embryonic stem cells resemble epithelial cells and express E-cadherin. Recent studies have suggested that ectopic expression of Klf4 in iPS cell reprogramming may be specifically responsible for inducing E-cadherin expression by binding to promoter regions and the first intron of CDH1 (the gene encoding for E-cadherin).

Life and career Toye was born in London. She initially worked as a dancer and choreographer both on stage and on film, collaborating with the likes of directors Jean Cocteau and Carol Reed. She directed the original production of Bless the Bride in 1947. Toye's debut film short, The Stranger Left No Card (1952), won the Best Fictional Short Film prize at the 1953 Cannes Film Festival, while her Christmas-themed short On the Twelfth Day‚Ä¶ (1955) received an Oscar nomination in the Best Short Subject category. She directed films from the early 1950s until the early 1980s. Toye also was an advisor to the Arts Council and lectured in Australia. She was attacked and robbed in her maisonette in Westminster on 27 November 1956. Two men stole jewellery and money. On 6 January 1958, she appeared as Roy Plomley's guest on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs. Her choices were wide-ranging, including Bach, Mahler and Lena Horne. She was the head of the jury at the 13th Berlin International Film Festival in 1963. Among the many charities supported by Toye were the Theatrical Guild (formerly the Theatrical Ladies' Guild), where she helped backstage and front-of-house staff, and became president, and the Actors' Charitable Trust, to which she was recruited by No√´l Coward, and of which she was vice president. Toye married Edward Selwyn Sharp in 1940; they divorced in 1950. Wendy Toye collaborated with the cartoonist and illustrator Ronald Searle on the films On The Twelfth Day (1955) and The King‚Äôs Breakfast (1963). Searle designed the decor & costumes and painted the sets. They first worked together on a stage play Wild Thyme (1955). Douglas Webb was the stills photographer on The King‚Äôs Breakfast.

The film was screened in the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) 2007 in the Indian Panorama section. The film depicts the current scenario of militancy in Assam. Plot A British couple visits Assam looking for the graveyard of the man's grandfather who was once a tea planter. With a view to drawing international attention, an underground rebel group kidnaps the couple. But being unable to communicate with the foreign couple, the outfit picks up an educated but frustrated youth who is fluent in English. Eager to be a part of that so-called \\"movement\\" of the group, the boy readily jumps in. But inside the hideout, Manab, the protagonist, discovers that the idea he had of the militant group and its \\"struggle for independence\\" was entirely wrong. He decides to help the British couple escape. In the process he is killed in a crossfire with all the militants present in the scene. Title of the film Speaking about the significance of the film title, Sabhapadit informed that Jatinga is a small place in Assam where birds are said to commit suicide. But this is not the case - birds do not actually commit suicide, they are lured to death. At night, people hold bamboo torches to attract these birds and when they fly close, they are clubbed to death. Same way in the guise of a revolution the boys are lured into a death trap. Drawing a similarity between the birds and the youth, he chose that title for his movie.

An absolute scale differs from an arbitrary, or \\"relative\\", scale, which begins at some point selected by a person and can progress in both directions. An absolute scale begins at a natural minimum, leaving only one direction in which to progress. An absolute scale can only be applied to measurements in which a true minimum is known to exist. Time, for example, which does not have a clearly known beginning, is measured on a relative scale, with an arbitrary zero-point such as the conventional date of the birth of Jesus (see Anno Domini) or the accession of an emperor. Temperature, on the other hand, has a known minimum, absolute zero (where volume of an ideal gas becomes zero), and therefore, can be measured either in absolute terms (e.g. kelvin), or relative to a reference temperature (e.g. degree Celsius). Absolute scales are used when precise values are needed in comparison to a natural, unchanging zero point. Measurements of length, area and volume are inherently absolute, although measurements of distance are often based on an arbitrary starting point. Measurements of weight can be absolute, such as atomic weight, but more often they are measurements of the relationship between two masses, while measurements of speed are relative to an arbitrary reference frame. (Unlike many other measurements without a known, absolute minimum, speed has a known maximum and can be measured from a purely relative scale.) Absolute scales can be used for measuring a variety of things, from the flatness of an optical flat to neuroscientific tests.

History The Castle hill is made of drift accumulating during centuries. However, a legend about its origin says that when Attila the Hun (also called the Scourge of God) plundered Aquileia (one of the biggest cities of the Roman Empire at that time) in the year 452, he asked his soldiers to build a hill to see the Aquileia burning. This was made by filling the helmet of each soldier with ground. The first official statement of the existence of a building on the hill dates back to 983: the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II donated to Rodoaldo, Patriarch of Aquileia a \\"castrum\\", a military building. The present building has the form of a palace and it was built on the ruins of a fortress destroyed in the year 1511 Idrija earthquake. The construction had started in 1517 and the works had lasted for 50 years. The external decoration of the palace and the paintings in the Parliament Hall are due to Giovanni da Udine, one of the pupils of Raphael. The council of the Patria del Friuli was one of the first parliaments in the world, and it was suppressed after the French occupation in 1797.

Every year on the evening of 3 September 100 men called \\"Facchini di Santa Rosa\\" (porters of Saint Rose) hoist the Macchina - weighing about 11,000 pounds - and carry it through the very narrow streets and squares of the medieval town centre. The whole route is a little bit more than . The procession is an important event in Viterbo and attracts thousands of people. Today, the procession is included in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. \\"The Machine of Santa Rosa\\", il Portale del Turismo a Viterbo e Provincia History The celebration consists of two distinct parts. On the afternoon of 2 September, a reliquary containing the heart of Santa Rosa is carried in procession accompanied by people in period costumes of the 14th through the 19th centuries. The transport of Machine of Santa Rosa takes place the following evening. The term \\"machine\\" is borrowed from classical Greek theater.Sodalizio Dei Facchini The transport of the Macchina dates back to the transfer of the body of Saint Rose of Viterbo. In 1258, six years after her death, her body was moved at the wish of Pope Alexander IV, from the former church Santa Maria del Poggio to the church Santa Maria delle Rose (today the pilgrimage chapel of Saint Rose). It is possible that originally a statue of St. Rose lit on a canopy was carried in procession.\\"Trasporto della Macchina di Santa Rosa\\", City of Viterbo Guilds were very active in the processions in the 14th century. From 1654 through 1663 the procession was suspended due to the plague. The first \\"machine\\" was probably designed by Count Sebastian Gregory Fani in 1686. The Civic Museum of Viterbo has a collection of sketches of the machine dating to 1690. In the 18th century the noble families of Viterbo sponsored lavish machines of Saint Rose. In 1790 the machine fell during the move. In 1801 the cries of a spectator robbed of her jewels by some pickpockets in the Piazza Fontana Grande panicked some cavalry horses. Twenty-two people in the crowd died in the ensuing confusion and later that night the machine caught fire in Piazza delle Erbe. Because of these events, the transport was temporarily banned by Pope Pius VII, only to resume around 1810. In 1814 tilted backwards and a few porters died. In 1893 pouring rain prevented the transport, which proved fortunate when it was later discovered that some anarchists were planning to throw bombs at the machine. The transport was suspended with the outbreak of World War I, but resumed in 1918.Galeotti, Mauro. \\"La Machina di Santa Rosa\\" From 1924 to 1951 (except for the interruption caused by the Second World War) the Machine of Santa Rosa was designed and constructed by Virgilio Papini, whose family had a long history of building the machines. In 1967 a new design did not get farther than the end of Via Cavour due to either excessive weight, or height, or tired Facchini. On the occasion of the arrival of the pontifex John Paul II, on 27 May 1984 there was organized a special transport. On 6 September 2009, Pope Benedict XVI viewed the new Macchina of Santa Rosa Fiore del Cielo in front of the pilgrimage chapel. In April 2014 the \\"Flower of Heaven\\" was erected at the Milan Expo; the new tower for 2015 is called \\"Gloria\\".\\"The machinery of Santa Rosa comes to Milan Expo\\", Chronicle (Milan), 17 April 2015 Construction Until a few decades ago, the Machine of Santa Rosa was built with paper mache and mounted on a wooden frame. Today, that system has been abandoned and replaced with various materials, such as resin, plastic and glass fiber, supported by a framework of steel pipes. Every five years a design competition is launched for a new Macchina. The guidelines of the competition ask for a tower, which is measured from the shoulder of the porters. The construction's maximum weight is to be less than 5 tonnes and the maximum width 4.3 metres. This is to respect the narrow parts of the historical centre, where eaves and balconies could strike the Macchina during transportation. The appearance of the Macchina has changed throughout history. The altar-like constructions from the 18th century developed to constructions similar to church towers and in the 2nd half of the 20th century they developed to 30m high sculptural towers. While originally the towers were mainly made from papier m√¢ch√©, today materials like steel, aluminium and fibre glass are used to achieve a light and fireproof construction. The current model (since 2009) is called \\"Fiore del Cielo\\" (ital. Flower of Heaven). It was designed by the architecture office Architecture and Vision (architects: Arturo Vittori and Andreas Vogler). The design is characterized by the three golden helix surfaces which grow upwards. In contrast to the former Macchina many innovations were introduced. Some of these are the golden color scheme and more than 1200 computer-controlled LED lights, which are illuminating the handmade textile roses. A special scenography was developed, which also includes a rain of rose petals on the spectators at a certain stop. Facchini The Sodality Facchini of Santa Rosa was founded in 1978 to keep alive the age old tradition and ensure it is done in a safe and responsible manner. The Sodality also promotes cultural activities, tourism, and mutual aid for its members. The Sodality was one of the signatories to the UNESCO project application. It is based at the Museum of the Society Facchini of Santa Rosa which opened in 1994. The Facchini wear a white uniform with a red sash tied at the waist and a headdress covered in leather. To be selected as one of the Facchini is considered a particular honor, and one most pass a test of strength, carrying a 150-kilogram box on his shoulders for at least one hundred meters without stopping. Before setting out they receive a special blessing. At around 9 pm the Facchini lift the 5 ton Macchina and start the first leg of the passage to the cheers of onlookers. For most of the route, the Facchini walk without any visual aid, directed by the capofacchini and guides posted at the four corners of the machine. Transport Fiore del Cielo on 5 September 2009 The transport of the Macchina of Santa Rosa is the annual main event of the city of Viterbo. Already at the afternoon the streets of the historical centre are being filled with citizens and visitors. The transport begins at the Porta Romana, where the assembled Macchina stays in a scaffold, which is covered with curtains. At around 8 pm the 800 candles of the Macchina are lighted by the local fire brigade. The street lighting will be switched off completely. During the transport there are five breaks. During these breaks the Macchina is put on special frames. The stopping places are: * Piazza Fontana Grande * Piazza del Plebiscito (in front of the guildhall) * Piazza delle Erbe * Corso Italia (in front of the church Santa Maria del Suffragio) * Piazza del Teatro.\\"The Machine of Santa Rosa Viterbo\\", City of Viterbo The last stretch up to the church of Santa Rosa has a remarkable inclination. In order to overcome this slope, the Macchina is pulled by ropes and additional people and is eventually placed in front of the pilgrimage chapel. The Macchina is exposed there for some days after the event.

Being a capable official of L√Ω Anh T√¥ng who helped the emperor in civil and military matters, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh was chosen by L√Ω Anh T√¥ng for the regentship of his son L√Ω Long Tr√°t. He was granted the title Prince and thus became the only possessor of the title who did not come from the L√Ω royal family. The achievements and loyalty of T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh to the infant emperor L√Ω Cao T√¥ng made him a highly praised figure in the history of Vietnam. Today, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh is considered one of the most prominent mandarins in the dynastic time of Vietnam. History=During L√Ω Anh T√¥ng's reign According to T·ª´ ƒëi·ªÉn b√°ch khoa to√†n th∆∞ Vi·ªát Nam, the birthyear of T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh was unknown; he was born in the H·∫° M·ªó village (now ƒêan Ph∆∞·ª£ng, Hanoi). Since his family name was T√¥, there was a hypothesis that he might have a kinship with T√¥ th·ªã, the wife of ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© who was the most powerful figure in the royal court during the early reign of L√Ω Anh T√¥ng. T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh was mentioned for the first time in historical account for his role in pacifying the rebellion of Th√¢n L·ª£i. In 1140, Th√¢n L·ª£i called himself the son of L√Ω Nh√¢n T√¥ng and raised a revolt against L√Ω Anh T√¥ng in the northern region (now Th√°i Nguy√™n). Th√¢n L·ª£i's army was finally suppressed by L√Ω troops led by ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© while Th√¢n L·ª£i was captured by T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh and beheaded by the order of L√Ω Anh T√¥ng in the tenth month of 1141. It was T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh who advised the emperor to grant amnesty for members of the rebellion to demonstrate the kindness of the dynasty to its people. During the early rule of L√Ω Anh T√¥ng, the most powerful official was ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© who decided military and civil matters of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, but T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh, as a court minister, began to prove his ability in the royal court. The historian Tr·∫ßn Tr·ªçng Kim remarked that ƒê·ªó Anh V≈© did not take any further step in taking power only because of the appearance of such skilled officials like T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh, Ho√†ng Nghƒ©a Hi·ªÅn or L√Ω C√¥ng T√≠n. After the death of ƒê·ªó Anh V≈©, in 1158, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh became the most prominent figure in the royal court who helped the emperor successfully rule the country. In the fifth month of 1159, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh put down the revolt of Ng∆∞u H·ªëng and Ai Lao in the western border and was promoted to the position of commander-in-chief (Th√°i √∫y) of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát army. In this position, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh conducted several measures to improve the efficiency of the army such as reorganizing, recruiting strong and young people, choosing capable commanders and stepping up the exercise in army. In the seventh month of 1167, L√Ω Anh T√¥ng appointed T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh commander of the military campaign against the kingdom of Champa, a campaign which was ordered to abandon after the king of Champa, Jaya Indravarman IV, proposed a withdrawal of the L√Ω Dynasty by offering L√Ω Anh T√¥ng tribute.Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., Originally holding a military position in the royal court, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh helped the emperor improve the efficiency of the L√Ω army and paid attention to the development of Confucian learning in the country. After the advice of T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh, L√Ω Anh T√¥ng issued the establishment the first temple of Confucius in ThƒÉng Long in 1156. Formerly, Confucius was jointly worshiped in the Temple of Literature, Hanoi. During L√Ω Cao T√¥ng's reign In 1175, the emperor was seriously ill and decided to entrust the regentship of his son L√Ω Long Tr√°t to T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh. The regent was appointed to the position of chancellor of the L√Ω Dynasty (Th√°i ph√≥ b√¨nh ch∆∞∆°ng qu√¢n qu·ªëc tr·ªçng s·ª±) and granted the title Prince (V∆∞∆°ng) ‚Äî an unprecedented act of a L√Ω emperor for a title that was reserved exclusively for members of the royal family. During the L√Ω Dynasty, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh was the only possessor of the title Prince who did not come from the L√Ω royal family. From the fourth month of 1175, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh began his regency because the emperor was not able to rule the country as the crown prince was only two years old. The emperor died in the seventh month in 1175 and began the campaign of the Empress Mother in supporting another prince, L√Ω Long X∆∞·ªüng, to replace the infant emperor L√Ω Long Tr√°t, now L√Ω Cao T√¥ng. The Empress Mother tried to bribe T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh's wife and persuaded the regent many times. T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh refused by a simple answer that he had to follow the order of the late emperor and preferred being honest to being rich but disloyal. His firmness in refusing the proposal of the Empress Mother and controlling the army and order during the funeral time made other officials believe in L√Ω Cao T√¥ng. They therefore declined the campaign of replacing him by the prince L√Ω Long X∆∞·ªüng. During his regentship, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh proved to be a skilled official with deep knowledge in military and civil matters. The regent died in 1179. To mourn the death of T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh, the emperor stopped attending the royal court for six days and cut down his meals for three days. According to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞, when he was ill, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh was thoughtfully cared by the official V≈© T√°n ƒê∆∞·ªùng while the mandarin Tr·∫ßn Trung T√° did not visit the regent due to busy work. Nevertheless, when the Empress Mother personally visited and asked T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh in his dying moments about a successor for his position, the regent at once recommended Tr·∫ßn Trung T√°. Being asked by the Empress Mother why he did not mention the devoted V≈© T√°n ƒê∆∞·ªùng, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh responded: \\"Because Your Highness asked for a successor of my position, I choose Tr·∫ßn Trung T√°, in case Your Highness need a servant, I will recommend V≈© T√°n ƒê∆∞·ªùng.\\"In Vietnamese: \\"V√¨ b·ªá h·∫° h·ªèi ng∆∞·ªùi n√†o c√≥ th·ªÉ thay th·∫ßn n√™n th·∫ßn n√≥i ƒë·∫øn Tr·∫ßn Trung T√°, c√≤n nh∆∞ h·ªèi ng∆∞·ªùi h·∫ßu d∆∞·ª°ng th√¨ phi T√°n ƒê∆∞·ªùng c√≤n ai n·ªØa?\\" However, after T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh's death, the Empress Mother did not follow his advice and the L√Ω Dynasty began to fall into a turbulent time and finally collapsed in 1225. Legacy The talent and faithful character of T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh was highly appreciated in the History of Vietnam. In 1394, the Retired Emperor Tr·∫ßn Ngh·ªá T√¥ng of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty ordered his painter to draw an illustration about four exemplary regents, in which only T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh was from ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. The other three ‚Äî the Duke of Zhou, Huo Guang and Zhuge Liang ‚Äî all came from China. Because of his achievements and loyalty for the infant emperor, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh was often compared with Zhuge Liang who was the dedicated regent for Liu Shan. Today, a main street in Hanoi and many places in Vietnam are named in honour of T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh. Each year a traditional festival is held in Ph√∫ Xuy√™n in the first lunar month to commemorate his feats. In the L√Ω B√°t ƒê·∫ø Shrine, the traditional temple for worshiping the emperors of the L√Ω Dynasty, T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh is one of only two civil mandarins who are jointly worshiped, along with L√Ω ƒê·∫°o Th√†nh.

He was also the chairman of Nature Conservation Society of Japan () until 1970, when he was awarded the Prince Chichibu Memorial Science Prize for his contributions to botany. Through his research, he campaigned for greater protection of mountain plant species. Takeda, who is known as the \\"father of Oze\\", helped establish Oze National Park. The area covers part of Fukushima, Tochigi, Gunma and Niigata Prefectures in Japan. A memorial hall was built in his honor at Hinoemata, Fukushima Prefecture. Personal life Takeda was married and had two daughters. He died aged 89 on June 7, 1972.

He is the Director of Communications for his party in both Government and Opposition, acting as the Prime Minister's chief enforcer overseeing cabinet ministers. Tucker was originally a secondary character, with Chris Langham's Hugh Abbot as the protagonist being watched over by Tucker. However, after Langham was fired from the series the show directed more attention towards Tucker and his dealings with the fictional Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship (DoSaC) ‚Äì originally the Department of Social Affairs (DSA) in series 1 and 2 ‚Äì which is portrayed as inept and incompetent. He is one of two characters from the series to appear in the film In the Loop, the other being Malcolm's deputy, Jamie McDonald, Senior Press Officer at No. 10. Background and personal life Other than the fact that he is Scottish and the character traits he exhibits during the series, little is known about Tucker's background or personal life. The nature of his home life is ambiguous and is somewhat contradictory through the course of the series. In the special episode \\"Spinners and Losers\\" he is revealed to have a niece; during a rant in front of Ollie in series 4, and speaking of himself in the third person, he explicitly states that he has no children (nor friends for that matter), and in series 3 he is shown spending his 50th birthday alone in his office. However, at other times, there are hints that he has a family - he wears a wedding ring (however, this is more likely to be Peter Capaldi's wedding ring, which he refuses to take off), there are children's drawings on the walls of his office, and when being pursued by photographers after his forced resignation, a young boy is briefly seen looking out of the window of Tucker's home. The reasons for his deep personal animosity towards journalist Simon Hewitt, mostly left open to speculation in the final cut, are explained to Ollie by Terri in one of the deleted scenes: Hewitt's current girlfriend, BBC health correspondent Kelly Grogan, had been Tucker's girlfriend until about three months earlier. Before the start of the series he forced his predecessor Steve Fleming (David Haig) to resign by announcing to the press that Fleming was resigning before even informing him, thereby leaving him no choice. No mention is made of Tucker's professional background before taking the position as Director of Communications for Number 10. Personality Tucker's personality makes him infamous and feared along the halls of Westminster. The series is rife with scenes denoting a rather complex personality. His short temper means he is likely to verbally abuse anyone who has caused him or the government embarrassment, stress or irritancy with his hallmark of foul language. He acts as the Prime Minister's enforcer to ensure the cabinet ministers all follow the party line, and managing the government's crisis management PR - usually in the form of spin. He regularly uses rumours, smears, or threats of extreme violence to achieve his ends, which he terms \\"Violent Sexual Imagery\\", and couples these with snide sarcasm. His fierce reputation for verbally abusing people became what Deputy Minister of DoSaC Fergus Williams (Geoffrey Streatfeild) referred to as, \\"a rite of passage\\" for politicians, to be \\"Tuckered\\". Although he frequently engages in profanity-laden rants, in Season 4, Episode 6 his long monologues during The Goolding Inquiry are almost devoid of any foul language. On a wider scale, and in spite of this brash, impulsive and volatile persona, he is strongly implied to be more intelligent and adept at long-term thinking than all or most of the other characters. His constant scheming, although borderline \\"Malchiavellian\\" in the words of Hugh Abbot, is paradoxically aimed at a common good, namely the prevalence of the party line and the resolution of issues arising from ministerial incompetence, whereas apparently friendly characters such as Ollie come across as covertly self-serving and egotistical by comparison. He is also implied to be a self-made man of humble origins (Mannion calls him the Gorbals Goebbels, seemingly in reference to his hometown), a firm believer in meritocracy and a staunch opponent of classism and cronyism, e.g. comparing the intentions of an MP's daughter to capitalise on her family connections to the practices of the Russian Empire and \\"the fucking Dimblebys\\". This probably places him well within the left wing of his own party, which although unnamed is strongly implied to be Labour; at one point aide Jamie even accuses him of being a member of the \\"Nutters\\", loosely based on the Gordon Brown faction which heavily contested Blair's Third Way politics. Accordingly, his demeanour towards working-class characters or anyone deemed a social inferior is sincerely empathetic, gentlemanly and devoid of condescension, as opposed to the obnoxious and patronizing behaviour displayed by characters such as Mannion or Pearson towards hotel receptionists or campaigning youths. The only exception to this behaviour shown is Douglas Tickel, a nurse with mental health problems who becomes a pawn of Tucker's schemes to oust Nicola Murray. The best explanation for this is that the publicity Tickel generated to oppose policies made him fair game in Tucker's eyes. He does on only two occasions show remorse and regret for his actions, notably when he hits Glenn, he expresses what appears to be genuine remorse. He even feels sorry for Glenn when he has a mini mental breakdown and tries to brighten his mood. His film portrayal, on the other hand, is arguably less sympathetic, and his actions seem less fueled by ideological persuasion than by an interest to keep his job at all costs. His reputation precedes him in his own party, amongst the opposition and in the media as shown in newspaper quotes given during The Goolding Inquiry: \\"Malcolm Tucker has the physical demeanour and the political instincts of a velociraptor\\" (The Guardian); \\"Tucker's writ runs through the lifeblood of Westminster like raw alcohol, at once cleansing and corroding\\" (The Daily Telegraph); \\"If you make eye contact with Malcolm Tucker, you have spilled his pint\\" (The Times); and \\"Iago with a BlackBerry\\" (The Spectator). Character relationships Malcolm is one of four \\"Spin doctors\\" featured on the show, the others being Cal Richards (Tom Hollander), Steve Fleming (David Haig), and Stewart Pearson (Vincent Franklin), the former three of whom make up the three spin doctors that are universally feared by ministers and civil servants alike. Cal Richards, nicknamed \\"The Fucker\\", is arguably the one person in British politics who is even more aggressive and unpredictable, whose excessively cruel and borderline psychopathic persona gives him legendary status within his party; his one on-screen appearance showed him bullying Pearson by pretending to sack him, and indiscriminately shouting torrents of abuse at the Opposition staff. While no on-screen relationship between him and Tucker is ever shown, The Missing DoSAC Files shows them to be very cordial with one another, partaking in occasional games of tennis. In a deleted scene, Malcolm voices his approval of Cal Richard's appointment as the Opposition's media strategist for the upcoming General Election, in spite of the trouble posed by the Opposition having a Malcolm-esque spin doctor during such time. Steve Fleming, while not as feared as Malcolm (mostly due to the fact that, unlike Tucker, he seldom swears), is nonetheless infamous throughout the party for his obsequious, unctuous personality (which is once described by Ollie Reeder as \\"Obsessive Repulsive Disorder\\"). He is shown to frequently lose his temper and lash out when faced with any opposition from his co-workers, implying he is mentally unbalanced. Tucker and Fleming harbour a mutual hatred, going back to when the former forced the latter to resign in 2003 (Tucker's diaries from The Missing DoSAC Files implies this hatred goes back even before then). Fleming exacts revenge on Tucker by forcing him to resign by informing the press before telling Malcolm; ironically the same way Tucker had forced Fleming to resign previously. However, upon his re- instatement by key figures in the party (most notably Julius Nicholson), Tucker exacts revenge on Steve by forcing Nicholson to pass the full blame of a recent scandal to Fleming in his inquiry report, forcing him to resign from his position after less than a week. Stewart Pearson is equally, if not more unpleasant than his fellow spin doctors, but not nearly as feared by his party or his opponents. Devoid of morals or competence by comparison, he is a cool, calm man who doesn't usually raise his voice and hides his intellectual mediocrity behind a hip, pseudo-modern political jargon, filled with bizarre buzzwords that no one understands; Adam Kenyon complains that he \\"need[s] subtitles\\" in order to be understood. His petulant disposition, indifference for colleagues' and subordinates' opinions, his \\"touchy-feely\\" managing style and his entirely unjustified arrogance make his work-colleagues (and Whitehall as a whole) despise him. Malcolm does not shy away from demonstrating his hatred of Stewart, branding him as \\"utterly fucking contemptible\\". Despite their reciprocal hatred, they are on occasion able to come to agreements regarding the public appearance of their respective parties - in Season 3 Episode 5 they agree to hold off on political point scoring in the light of a story concerning donations from a prominent sweat-shop labour company to both their political parties being made public. Tucker has very little patience for the incompetence of ministers and other civil servants in Whitehall to the point where he describes himself in series four as having \\"no real friends\\". He considered Hugh Abbot to be bumbling, incompetent and out of touch with the public, and was constantly fed up with having to deal with his mistakes. His treatment of Hugh's successor, Nicola Murray (Rebecca Front), was considerably more sympathetic, with Tucker deeming her a \\"nice lady\\", and even helping to move forward her (rather fanciful) policy ideas. However, this professional respect quickly deteriorated following the General Election; Nicola's time as Leader of the Opposition was a complete disaster, until Malcolm staged a coup d'√©tat against her, declaring her \\"a waste of skin\\". Despite this, he attests at the Goolding Inquiry that he still retained great respect for her as a person, and even went so far as to applaud her tenure as Minister of DoSaC. Despite showing no care for Ollie Reader (Chris Addison), Tucker often uses him in his schemes as he does not doubt his basic skills. Like everyone else, he views Ollie as a \\"wannabe\\" Malcolm. He tends to threaten Ollie more than other members of DoSaC like Glenn or Terri, implying he finds Ollie more irritating, probably because Ollie is often responsible for the mistakes Malcolm has to manage. Glenn is possibly the only major character to whom Malcolm shows any (if occasional) warmth due to his misfortunes, unwavering loyalty to Hugh Abbot, and the fact he shows more common sense than any of his colleagues. However, Tucker loses all respect for Glenn when he defects, branding him a traitor when rebuffing his attempt to re-join Malcolm's party. The only other person he allows to criticise him without retaliation is fellow Scotsman, Press Officer, Jamie McDonald (Paul Higgins), one of the few people who is arguably more aggressive than Malcolm (being referred to as \\"the crossest man in Scotland\\" in In The Loop), who is \\"let off his leash\\" to do Malcolm's work for him when he needs to be in two places at once. Despite his capability as Malcolm's enforcer, Jamie is not as adept at strategic thinking as Malcolm, which the latter comes to recognise when Jamie, out to his hatred of prime minister-in-waiting, Tom Davis, leaks rumours about Tom's alleged use of antidepressants, despite the best chance of Jamie and Malcolm's careers surviving the transition lying in supporting Tom. He has a long-standing rivalry with party Life Peer Julius Nicholson (Alex MacQueen), who delights in his sacking at the end of series 3, but does help him return to power in the next episode. He also has a rivalry with \\"Fat Pat\\". He hates Cliff Lawton (Timothy Bentinck), Hugh's predecessor, who harbours a grudge against Malcolm for forcing him to resign. Cliff hoped to take revenge by becoming PM with the help of Jamie McDonald in the special \\"Spinners and Losers\\"; this fell apart as soon as Malcolm learnt the identity of Jamie's stalking horse. Perhaps his most important relationship is with his secretary, Sam (Samantha Harrington), toward whom he is very protective; he is seen speaking fondly of her to Hugh Abbot in Series 2. Even in the immediate aftermath of his own forced resignation at the end of series 3, he is shown trying to comfort her and protect her from the men removing him from his office. She is one of the few people who genuinely likes Tucker and is visibly upset when he is fired. Even though she is not a party hack, she moved with Malcolm after his party lost the General election to stay as his assistant. She was present every day at the Goolding Inquiry, her face evolves into visible concern towards the end of the inquiry as she witnesses an end to Malcolm's career. Fictional history=Series 1 In Series 1, Department of Social Affairs (DSA) minister Cliff Lawton is given the sack by Malcolm Tucker because of press pressure, though he drafts him a letter of resignation to give him \\"the chance to say you're jumping before you're pushed\\". He selects a new minister for DSA, Hugh Abbot. The new minister decides to make his mark by launching an anti-benefit fraud initiative on vague approval from the prime minister without going through the proper procedures. Malcolm makes him scrap the announcement at the last minute to avoid confusion between the prime minister and the treasury, forcing Hugh to announce nothing at his scheduled press conference. Later, when the prime minister suddenly approves the initiative, Malcolm successfully spins a story that Hugh did actually make the announcement at the press conference. He then intimidates Ollie Reeder's ex-girlfriend, Angela Heaney, who was the journalist originally assigned to cover the story, into not reporting on the farcical flip-flops that resulted from dysfunctional communication within government. Hugh exasperates Malcolm by being out of touch with the common man and popular culture, so he attempts to get him to watch zeitgeist tapes. At the same time, Hugh supports a bad policy on juvenile rehabilitation because of the unanimous approval it receives from focus groups, further worsening his public image. When Malcolm and Hugh mistakenly think Simon Hewitt, a sharp journalistic critic of Hugh, engineered the focus group gaffe because one of the prominent groupees was really an actress, they attempt to intimidate her and get Angela Heaney to publish a tamer version of the story. It however transpires that Hewitt has no relation to the groupee; and, ironically, they've leaked an embarrassing story unnecessarily. After a housing bill, spearheaded by Hugh and junior minister Dan Miller, that prohibits owning an empty second property, passes successfully through parliament, Hugh becomes in the position where he leaves his London flat empty for long stretches of time, so he tries to get around the contradiction by putting the flat on the market but not accepting any offers. When this is discovered by Angela Heaney, an incandescent Malcolm hurries to manage the situation: he gets the flat sold extremely quickly, below market price, but it is already too late. The scandal causes Malcolm to urge Hugh to resign to save the housing bill, explaining that such a resignation would be seen as honourable, but Hugh is very reluctant to do so. After Malcolm reads an upcoming inquiry report that incriminates Hugh badly, he decides to send the message that the government won't \\"throw a good man out to the wolves over one single little fuck-up.\\" Dan Miller ends up resigning to further boost his long-term image and political career, and Hugh stays. Series 2 In Series 2, Hugh Abbot is accosted by a member of the factory he is visiting and he begs Malcolm to bury the story for him. Malcolm has more pressing issues; an important story on a major IT project's overspending and possible corruption on the part of Geoff Holhurst, but he goes to ITN to help Hugh out anyway. He fabricates a story that the seemingly \\"real person\\" factory worker is actually standing for a far-right political party; the reporters agree to minimise the story. However, when the Holhurst story breaks at the same time, he decides to send Olly to re-shift the focus at ITN from Holhurst to the Hugh story. With a cabinet reshuffle imminent, Malcolm struggles with a new \\"blue-sky thinker\\" special advisor to the prime minister: Julius Nicholson, who's always floating ludicrous government projects and challenging Malcolm's authority. He finds allies in the Department of Social Affairs when Julius cuts them out of Malcolm's prestigious \\"8:30\\" meetings, and devises plans to significantly downsize them in the upcoming reshuffle. He uses Olly, Glenn Cullen, and Hugh to \\"leak\\" rumours that Julius will be named foreign secretary in the reshuffle, and then convinces the prime minister that Julius himself is responsible for the rumours as a gambit to guarantee a promotion. The prime minister decides to demote Julius, and Malcolm maintains his position unperturbed. He rewards his allies by getting them a promotion as \\"The all-new totally revamped Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship\\" (DoSaC). Hugh struggles with his conscience about being forced to support a bill on special educational needs (SEN) he previously objected to because he believes will harm special-needs pupils, Glenn's own son being one. Malcolm gets him an education expert friendly to the government position to ease his feelings and to give him something to say to explain his apparent U-turn to the Select Committee. When Hugh accidentally sends an expletive e-mail about Malcolm's expert to a young girl in Reigate instead of Glenn, Malcolm convinces Terri Coverley to take the blame for it, as it happened on her computer. Hugh gets himself in another pickle when he lies to the Select Committee by denying that he met any experts who opposed the bill. Malcolm makes Hugh apologise to the committee and convince them that he really is convinced the bill will help SEN children. \\"The Rise of the Nutters\\" 2007 Special In the special \\"The Rise of the Nutters,\\" Malcolm and his lieutenant Jamie are frustrated by the increasing influence of the \\"nutters,\\" elements in the government that have unofficially sworn allegiance to the anticipated next prime minister \\"Tom\\" after the current PM announces that he will resign within a year. Their attempt to properly prepare a \\"junior nutter,\\" Ben Swain, for an interview with Jeremy Paxman on the problems in the immigration system fails miserably and he embarrasses himself on TV. Malcolm is also enraged that Olly's girlfriend in the opposition stole an idea to have a politician visit an immigration centre to determine the exact problems in the system, originally Malcolm's own idea. These events, along with an ominous comment from Julius Nicholson, lead Malcolm to suspect that the prime minister will depart sooner than expected. Fearing that he will not survive the transition if he is not properly prepared, Tucker tries to leak the prime minister's legacy project to the opposition, thinking it will delay the resignation. In the ensuing confusion, the prime minister decides to scrap the project altogether. Malcolm breathes a sigh of relief, but is shocked when this leads to the prime minister actually resigning much earlier than expected: the very next day. \\"Spinners and Losers\\" 2007 Special In the second special, \\"Spinners and Losers,\\" Malcolm and others struggle to maintain their powers in the chaotic transition. \\"Nice Nutter Nick\\", a junior minister, appears to be a clear threat to Malcolm's position. Furious with Malcolm for his involvement in the PM's resignation, Jamie tries to take control himself by leaking a story about Tom's alleged use of antidepressants, causing the prime minister-in-waiting to lose support very rapidly. In the chaos, Malcolm sees an opportunity to regain his influence, and so orchestrates a back-up plan suggestion to support Clare Ballentine instead, knowing Nick will claim it as his own idea and that Ballentine will end up refusing the candidature. Malcolm then manipulates Nick into also suggesting Ben Swain, who is soon shot down as well. Finally, Dan Miller, now an extremely influential figure, surfaces and announces that he will back Tom, and that Tom has chosen Malcolm as his media liaison. Malcolm secures his place by convincing Tom of Nick's \\"betrayals\\". Series 3 In Series 3, Malcolm scrambles to assign the DoSaC position amidst a reshuffle; when most candidates refuse the job, he's forced to choose Nicola Murray, who is much less politically experienced than he had hoped. Malcolm's background checks discover an apparent conflict of interest with Nicola's husband, who works for a company that was awarded a government PFI contract; combined with Nicola intending to send her daughter to a private secondary school, this guarantees to destroy Nicola's reputation when she's only just started. At the same time, Malcolm has to contend with a by-election in Leamington Spa that might be compromised by the daughter of the previous MP standing as an independent, thus damaging the chances of the party's candidate, Liam Bentley. Malcolm decides to send as many party figures as possible, including Nicola, to support Bentley's election; and, to teach Nicola a lesson about how cruel the press can be to ministers, schemes an embarrassing photograph of her grinning with two thumbs up in front of a large poster that, due to a crop, appears to read \\"I AM BENT\\". Upon finding out that on top of Nicola's problems she also has claustrophobia, Malcolm freaks out and calls her an \\"omnishambles\\". He forces Nicola to reconcile the conflict of interest by choosing between \\"fucking up [her] daughter's life and fucking up [her] husband's life\\", but promises to help her implement her long-term policy ideas on social mobility. Malcolm tries to improve Nicola's image by taking her to a dinner at the Guardian; but this is compromised when a huge data loss occurs in the immigration database that DoSaC is responsible for. Malcolm is further infuriated when Nicola accidentally lets go of the data loss in the presence of a freelance journalist. He makes Nicola call the journalist in and remedy the situation by sacking a scapegoat. At a party conference in Eastbourne, Malcolm is tipped off by Angela Heaney's enquiries that health statistics that Tom is going to announce in his speech are actually fake numbers lifted from an online blog. Forced to change the speech at the last minute and desperate for any material; he convinces a civilian, Julie, with grievances about a construction negligence scandal originally brought in by Glenn for Nicola's speech to instead go with the prime minister. When Glenn tries to resist, Malcolm punches him in the nose in the ensuing struggle. After Malcolm apologises, he decides to help Nicola fill the hole he created in her speech. However, the punch story is leaked and shows up on internet blogs and Malcolm has to send Julie away from the conference to avoid her talking with the press and he suspects an inept party press officer, John Duggan, is responsible for the leak. He eventually discovers that it was Julie who tweeted about it. When she has had enough of their flip-flops, she insults the party and decides to leave. In retaliation, Malcolm swiftly tricks a blogger into spinning a story that it was actually them who decided to drop her because of her \\"extremist views\\"; actually just the fact that she supports allowing vendors the freedom to use any measuring system. During a visit from the shadow Social Affairs department, Malcolm tries to keep Murray's daughter's problems at her new school from leaking to the press. He verbally abuses Phil Smith, an Opposition advisor from whom the party obtained the story, into keeping his party from leaking the story, but his efforts are ultimately in vain. However, when the press finds the story too personal to run with, they decide to attack the principal of the school instead, for giving Nicola's daughter special treatment. A distraught and guilty Nicola snaps at Malcolm about the ruthlessly corrupt political bickering she's found herself in, but is eventually convinced by Malcolm to abandon her reservations and embrace the dirty fighting, allowing her to quietly move her daughter from the school in return. On Malcolm's fiftieth birthday, Nicola Murray and her opposite number, Peter Mannion, go head to head on BBC Radio 5 Live. He tries to get her to improve her performance by passing instructions to Ollie, but to little avail. Malcolm is forced to go to the studio himself when a caller accuses Mannion's party of receiving donations from a company notorious for unethical labour practices, which also donates a great deal to Malcolm's party. Malcolm is unable to prevent that fact from being broadcast, and when Stewart Pearson tries to capitalise on the leak, the two exchange threats about scandals related to their respective parties. They eventually come to a compromise, both agreeing to refrain from using the donations story for political capital, and decide to abandon Nicola and Peter at the radio station, deeming them too incompetent to warrant saving. When rumours of a leadership challenge from Nicola Murray surface, Malcolm has to drop everything and ensure that the rumours stop spreading, going so far as to put the entire DoSAC building on lockdown. After several of his plans to salvage the situation go awry, Terri calls him out on this in front of the main DoSaC staff, who look on in dread. Instead of unleashing his wrath on Terri, Malcolm confides in her about the immense stress he is currently under trying to keep the party functioning, as well as his political clout starting to ebb, potentially due to the resurfacing of his arch-enemy Steve Fleming. When DoSaC try to get Andy Murray to sponsor their new Healthy Eating campaign, Malcolm is nowhere to be found. Under the guise of being on holiday, Malcolm invites several of his journalist contacts to what is ostensibly a friendly lunch at his house, where he makes it clear that despite rumours to the contrary, he's still \\"at the heart of government\\". Due to an throwaway comment made by one of his journalist contacts, he compels the DoSAC staff to abandon the idea of using a celebrity as their policy sponsor, just as they have confirmed Andy Murray. The resulting kerfuffle is quickly overshadowed by the apparent doctoring of the crime figures, which DoSAC had published at the behest of Steve Fleming MP, Malcolm's arch-nemesis. Malcolm quickly descends onto the scene, and both he and Steve Fleming are forced to deal with the resulting scandal. However, Steve does to Malcolm what Malcolm did to him years before, forcing him to resign over the crime statistics by leaking it to the press before telling him, leaving Malcolm no choice but to do so. As he leaves Downing Street he vows to his comrades, \\"You will see me again!\\" In the Series 3 finale, ministers and civil servants alike have grown tired of Fleming after only a week and realise that Malcolm must return, as they all agree that despite everyone fearing him and enjoying not being abused or threatened by him, Malcolm's work as the party's protecting screen against the media is their only chance at surviving the impending general election. He receives help from long-standing rival Julius Nicholson, who agrees to pardon Malcolm from his alleged wrongdoings in his inquiry report concerning the crime statistics on the condition of Malcolm's return. However, Nicholson is forced to blame it all on Steve Fleming who, due to Malcolm's machinations, is made to look guilty in trying to influence the inquiry report. Malcolm swiftly descends back onto the scene to hand Fleming his resignation letter. He regains his position and gives a foul-mouthed battle speech to ministers and civil servants about the impending election. Series 4 In Series 4 he returns, bored of two years in opposition, working for the new Leader of the Opposition Nicola Murray MP, who became leader instead of the politically astute Dan Miller MP on the grounds of \\"a technicality\\". Realising that the party would never get back into power with Nicola at the helm, he plots with Ollie Reeder and Dan Miller to overthrow her, and instate Dan as the Leader of the Opposition. In episode 4 of Series 4, a front-page headline in which Steve Fleming deemed Nicola Murray \\"unelectable\\" prompts Malcolm to launch a concerted attack on Nicola's leadership. When Nicola takes a train to Bradford to spearhead a PR stunt in the hopes of improving her image, Malcolm encourages Ben Swain to resign from his position as Shadow Minister for DoSAC to precipitate the putsch, with the promise that he will re-enter Cabinet as Foreign Secretary. But Swain accepts Nicola's counter-offer for Shadow Chancellor and reneges on his deal with Malcolm, prompting Dan Miller to offer him the same to ensure that he still resigns. Meanwhile, under Malcolm's orders, Ollie convinces Glenn to leak an old email, in which both Nicola and Ben voiced their approval for the sell-off of PFI worker housing that resulted in the suicide of Public Sector worker, Nurse Douglas Tickel, who was made homeless due to the sell-off. In the ensuing chaos, Malcolm encourages Nicola to call for an inquiry into Mr Tickel's death, knowing that the fallout caused by the leaked email will spell the end of both her and Ben's political careers. This forces both Nicola and Ben to resign from their positions, allowing Dan Miller to take over as Leader of the Opposition. After Nicola's resignation, Malcolm makes clear to Nicola in no uncertain terms how little political standing she has, describing her tenure as party leader as a \\"flatlining non-leadership\\" and deeming the best thing to come out of it being the inquiry into the death of Mr Tickel, which would spell doom for both the government's image and Nicola's political career. However, each party tries to cover their tracks, resulting in the leaking of several humiliating emails in which the Opposition staff make clear their contempt for the deceased nurse Douglas Tickel. This prompts the Prime Minister to announce, to everyone's horror, an inquiry into the culture of leaking as well as the death of Mr Tickel. It is revealed in the inquiry that Malcolm was in possession of Mr Tickel's medical records and national insurance number after an accidental admission by drawing attention to a photograph that he helped organise to bring down Nicola Murray. Malcolm denies leaking the medical records under oath, making him susceptible to possible perjury charges (in addition to the illegal possession of Tickel's medical records). It is strongly hinted that Malcolm was responsible for the leaking of private details about inquiry member, Baroness Sureka, when she began to question his bullying tactics. She was missing from the panel for several days because of this. In his final appearance at the Goolding enquiry, he deems the purpose of the inquiry to be pointless, asserting that \\"the culture of leaking\\" is an essential part of modern political and public arena, and blasts the panel for laying blame for the entire predicament on him, which, in his words, \\"is the result of a political class, which has given up on morality and simply pursues popularity at all costs.\\" Upon hearing that the Goolding Inquiry intend to press charges of perjury, Malcolm makes preparations to quietly get arrested at a police station while he sends Dan Miller to attract publicity at another station, to make the Government look unresponsive at the police backlog crisis and to divert attention from himself. He gives a final foul-mouthed rant to Ollie, that Ollie calls, \\"the kind of video that you leave on Youtube after you've blown your brains out,\\" that reveals some personal thoughts and feelings from Malcolm. He insists that Ollie will never be him and that he will not survive the job of replacing him. He tells Ollie that he will witness the master of spin go out \\"with my head held fucking high.\\" Ollie, however. leaks that Malcolm is going to give himself up, and soon the media are waiting for Malcolm outside the station. He and his lawyer try to escape without being seen, but are spotted fleeing the station. He asks Ollie to find another station for him, begging that \\"I need my dignity\\". When he arrives at the new station the press have been informed that Malcolm will be there. Malcolm looks on as he realises that this is the end. Ollie leaked to the press the new location of Malcolm's arrest. As he prepares to leave the station, his lawyer reads a statement announcing his resignation as Director of Communications, while Malcolm looks on with sadness and bitterness in his eyes. When reporters shout whether he has anything to say, he says he wants to say something but, unable to think of anything to say that could potentially pave the way for a return to politics, simply says, \\"it doesn't matter\\". He then boards a waiting taxi and departs the station, and is last seen looking solemnly out of the taxi window, contemplating his future. Creation, basis and portrayals in different media The character was inspired by Tony Blair's spin doctor Alastair Campbell's reputation. The character is based on several figures, most notably real life Director of Communications for Prime Minister Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell, who admitted to his liberal use of profanities in the workplace. Capaldi later revealed that his personal preferable inspiration for the character was notorious Hollywood producers, most notably Harvey Weinstein.Radio Times 4‚Äì10 February 2012 p.18 In the spin off feature film, In the Loop, Tucker, Jamie, Sam and Angela Heaney are the only four characters to stay the same from the TV series. In it, Tucker has to deal with an incompetent minister who has told the press that war is unforeseeable, causing more strain to the hot and delicate topic. Tucker is sent to be a willing and very active pawn in the efforts of a warmongering United States Assistant Secretary of State towards an intervention in the Middle East, which the British Prime Minister and American President want. This he does by fabricating intelligence in what could be a fictionalised version of the so- called Dodgy Dossier issued by Alastair Campbell and used by the British government to justify its involvement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Campbell, who confessed to enjoying The Thick of It and even found it \\"hilarious\\", was vocal in expressing his dislike of the film version. Two months after the airing of the final episode of series four, Peter Capaldi appeared on GQ magazine's front cover as Malcolm Tucker and recorded a Christmas message to fans. This has so far been the last appearance of the character. Armando Iannucci stated in 2012 that series 4 would most likely be The Thick of It's last, but could return for a few specials or something in the future.http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/26/the-thick-of-it-writer-armando-iannucci- well-leave-you-wanting-more-607955/ Following Capaldi's casting as the Doctor in Doctor Who, Iannucci revealed that the show is definitely over for good. He joked that he has no plans for Tucker to appear in Veep as Tucker is either dead or in prison.https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/malcolm-tucker-dead- armando-iannucci-3844401 However, following Iannucci's exit from the show in 2015 and Capaldi revealing he was set to direct some episodes of the show, he revealed he would be open to appearing again.http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-09-11/peter-capaldi-casually- mentioned-hes-directing-episodes-of-veep-like-its-no-big-deal Tucker makes an appearance in Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's 2012 comic book The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century 2009, where he is seen being interviewed by the journalist Jon Snow on television. Iannucci, a friend of Moore's, authorised the use of the character. The October 2017 edition of The Big Issue, guest-edited by Iannucci, features a debate on Brexit conducted via email between Tucker and another of Iannucci's characters, Alan Partridge.https://www.bigissue.com/culture/alan-partridge-vs-malcolm-tucker- how-our-iannucci-exclusive-broke-internet/ Reception For his portrayal of Malcolm Tucker, Peter Capaldi has been lauded by critics and was nominated for the BAFTA award for Best Comedy Performance-Male at the 2006, 2008 and 2013 awards.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459159/awards He won the award for Best Comedy Performance-Male at the 2010 awards.

Hana Glasser of American magazine Slate said that, \\"The character of Tucker is reason enough to elevate The Thick of It over Veep...The brilliant Peter Capaldi, who delivers profanity of the highest imaginable caliber\\". Empire magazine placed one of Tucker's rants in In the Loop as the 6th greatest movie insults of all time. Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy said, \\"Malcolm Tucker remains one of the most incredible TV creations of all time\\". Hollywood actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are self-confessed fans of Malcolm Tucker and his foul mouthed rants according to Peter Capaldi, who co-starred with Pitt in the 2012 zombie-action film World War Z. Influence on culture In episode 1 of series 3, the word \\"Omnishambles\\" was coined by Tucker to describe Nicola Murray. The word was created by Thick of It writer Tony Roche. Following this many notable politicians used the phrase, e.g. Ed Miliband used it during Prime Minister's Questions on 18 April 2012 to criticise the Government's 2012 budget. The British media used the phrase to describe US presidential hopeful Mitt Romney upon his UK tour, when he said that he didn't believe Britain would be ready for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Due to its adoption by real life politicians, the word was entered into the Oxford English Dictionary on 13 November 2012. In the run-up to the 2010 general election, the column 'Malcolm Tucker's election briefing' appeared weekly in The Guardian, written by Jesse Armstrong. When Capaldi was cast as the Doctor in Doctor Who, his incarnation of the character shared certain personality traits with Tucker, specifically \\"a certain acid wit... the attitude, the wisecracks and the energy... he can be edgy, volatile and dangerous\\".

The dome of the Old Supreme Court Building is visible on the right. The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal was established in 1994 pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. Article 100 provides a mechanism for the President of Singapore, acting on the advice of the Singapore Cabinet, to refer to the Tribunal for its opinion any question as to the effect of any provision of the Constitution which has arisen or appears to likely to arise. Questions referred to the Tribunal may concern the validity of enacted laws or of bills that have not yet been passed by Parliament. Constitutional questions may also be referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President to refer to the Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval. The Tribunal consists of not less than three judges of the Supreme Court. Its opinions are binding on all other courts. Since the Tribunal was established in 1994, to date only one constitutional question has been referred to it. The Tribunal determined in 1995 that although Article 5(2A) was not in force, Article 22H(1) did not prevent Parliament from restricting the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. Since then, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to persuade Cabinet to invoke the Article 100 procedure. History Parliament (Parliament House, photographed in December 2008, is pictured) The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal is an ad hoc tribunal established by Article 100 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.Now the . Article 100 was introduced into the Constitution by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 2) Act 1994,. which was passed by Parliament on 25 August 1994 and assented to by President Ong Teng Cheong on 14 September 1994. It came into force on 1 October 1994. Prior to the enactment of Article 100, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted during the Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 2) Bill that the Singapore Constitution had no provisions for referring questions of constitutional interpretation to the courts for an advisory ruling, especially those relating to new and complex provisions of the Constitution. Article 100 was intended to address this perceived lacuna in the Constitution.. One question of constitutional interpretation that was highlighted during the parliamentary debates pertained to the former Article 22H which had been incorrectly inserted into the Constitution by the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1991No. 5 of 1991. in January 1991.Lee Hsien Loong (1994), Singapore Parliamentary Debates, col. 429. Article 22H(1) provided that the President might, acting in his discretion, withhold his assent to any bill passed by Parliament (other than a bill to which Article 5(2A) applied) if the bill provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. At that time, Article 5(2A), which entrenched certain core constitutional provisions (of which Article 22H(1) was one) by requiring the approval of the electorate at a national referendum for their amendment, had not been brought into force.Art. 5(2A) is not yet in force, as the Government is still fine-tuning the constitutional provisions relating to the discretionary powers of the President: see In August 1994, Parliament intended to amend Article 22H to restrict the President's powers thereunder to only non-constitutional bills which provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the President's discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. Because Article 5(2A) was not in force, a question arose as to whether the President had the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H. President Ong Teng Cheong stated that in the interest of testing out the system, he wished to have this question referred to the courts for a ruling, and that he would accept as correct whatever interpretation of Article 22H was given by the court. In response to his request, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution by Parliament for that purpose.Lee Hsien Loong (1994), Singapore Parliamentary Debates, cols. 431‚Äì432. Reference of constitutional questions=Grounds for bringing of reference President S.R. Nathan and his wife Urmila Nandey with young people in July 2005. The President refers constitutional questions to the Tribunal on the advice of Cabinet and not of his own accord. A constitutional question can be referred to the Tribunal on three grounds. First, under Article 100 itself, the President, acting on the advice of Cabinet, may refer to the Tribunal for its opinion any question as to the effect of any provision of the Constitution which has arisen or appears to the President likely to arise.Constitution, Art. 100(1). During the parliamentary debates preceding the introduction of Article 100, Nominated Member of Parliament Associate Professor Walter Woon posed the following question: The reply by the Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was threefold:Lee Hsien Loong (1994), Singapore Parliamentary Debates, cols. 454‚Äì455. *Article 100 was drafted by following the precedent in the Constitution of Malaysia. Since it had worked for Malaysia, the drafters thought it safe for Singapore to follow suit. *It was the intention of legislation concerning the elected President that the initiative to refer the question to the Tribunal should lie with the Government, and generally not with the President whose recourse was in vetoing the legislation. The Cabinet would advise the President and the matter would then be referred to the Tribunal. *In the event of Cabinet wishing to ride roughshod over the President's views and refusing to refer a particular matter, there would be considerable public pressure exerted on the Government to so refer. Questions referred to the Tribunal may concern the validity of enacted laws or of bills that have not yet been passed by Parliament.See Constitution, Art. 100(4), which states: \\"No court shall have jurisdiction to question the opinion of any tribunal or the validity of any law, or any provision therein, the Bill for which has been the subject of a reference to a tribunal by the President under this Article.\\" [Emphasis added.] The other two grounds relate to attempts by Parliament to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. Article 22H of the Constitution deals with attempts to alter the President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President to refer to the Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact has the effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. If the Tribunal determines that the bill does not have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court.Constitution, Arts. 22H(1), (2) and (3). When Article 5A is brought into force, the President will also be able to decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or indirect effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. In this case, the Cabinet may also advise the President to refer to the Tribunal the question of whether the bill indeed has this effect. If the Tribunal rules that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the Government Gazette.Constitution, Art. 5A. Procedure A reference must be made under the hand of (that is, signed by) the President, and must be served on the Attorney-General.Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5, 2006 Rev. Ed. ) (\\"RC\\"), Order 58 rules 2(2) and (3). The Attorney-General is required to assist the Tribunal in the hearing of the reference, and the President may be represented by such legal counsel as the Tribunal may appoint, after consulting the President.RC, O. 58 r. 6. The parties appearing before the Tribunal are not confined to the President and the Attorney-General. The Tribunal may direct that the hearing of a reference be notified to any interested person or, where there is an interested class of persons, to one or more representatives of the class.RC, O. 58 r. 5. If there is any interest that is affected which is not represented by counsel, the Tribunal may request that counsel argue the case for this interest.RC, O. 58 r. 7. The reference must state the questions on which the Tribunal's opinion is required in a form which allows, as far as possible, answers to be given in the affirmative or the negative. There must also be a concise statement of facts, and documents must be included, as are necessary to enable the Tribunal to decide the questions referred.RC, O. 58 rr. 3(1) and (2). During the hearing of a reference, the procedure in proceedings before the Court of Appeal applies. The President of Singapore is treated as the appellant and all other parties as respondents.RC, O. 58 r. 8(3). However, the Tribunal is not bound by strict rules of evidence.RC, O. 58 r. 9. The proceedings of the Tribunal, except for the hearing for directions, are held in open court.RC, O. 58 r. 10. No party to any proceedings is ordered to pay any costs, and no court fees are payable in respect of any proceedings.RC, O. 58 rr. 14 and 15. The Tribunal has to consider and answer a question referred to it not more than 60 days after the date of such reference. The Tribunal is mandated to certify to the President for his information its opinion on the question referred to it with reasons for its answer, and any Tribunal judge who differs from the opinion of the majority shall similarly certify his opinion and his reasons. The opinion of the majority of judges is the opinion of the Tribunal, and is required to be pronounced in open court.Constitution, Arts. 100(2) and (3). Composition The Constitution provides that the Tribunal must consist of not less than three judges of the Supreme Court, as Parliament intended that the Tribunal should have the same structure as the Court of Appeal.Lee Hsien Loong (1994), Singapore Parliamentary Debates, col. 428. The (\\"SCJA\\"), s. 30(1), states: \\"The civil and criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal shall be exercised by 3 or any greater uneven number of Judges of Appeal.\\" In practice, the Tribunal consists of the Chief Justice and not less than two other judges of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may determine. If for any reason the Chief Justice is unable to be a Tribunal member, the Tribunal must consist of not less than three Supreme Court judges. The Chief Justice is the President of the Tribunal and, in his absence, the presidency of the Tribunal is determined in accordance with the following order of precedence:RC, O. 58 r. 4 read with the SCJA, s. 4. *the vice- presidents of the Court of Appeal; *the Judges of Appeal (other than vice- presidents); and *the Judges of the High Court. Among themselves, the judges in each category rank according to the priority of their appointments to the Bench.SCJA, s. 4. Effect of opinions Opinions of the Tribunal cannot be questioned by any court. This includes the Tribunal's view of the validity of any law, the bill of which has been the subject of a reference to a Tribunal. This means that although the Tribunal lies outside the normal hierarchy of the courts since it does not hear appeals from any courts, its opinions are binding on all other courts. It is technically open for the President, on Cabinet's advice, to refer the same matter to the Tribunal for its re- consideration. Invocations of the constitutional reference process=Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995 Since the creation of the Tribunal in 1994, only one constitutional reference has been made to it. Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995Constitutional Reference No 1 of Singapore [1995] 1 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 803. arose from the issue of the application of Article 22H(1) of the Constitution in relation to Article 5(2A), which was and is still not yet in force. The matter was referred by President Ong Teng Cheong to clarify the scope of the application of both Articles. The Government was represented by Chan Sek Keong and Soh Tze Bian of the Attorney-General's Chambers, and the Presidency by Joseph Grimberg and Walter Woon. The Constitutional Tribunal, which consisted of the Chief Justice Yong Pung How and Judges of Appeal M. Karthigesu and L.P. Thean, held that although Article 5(2A) was in abeyance, it represented the will of Parliament and therefore had to be taken into consideration. The Tribunal concluded that the President had no power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A). Attempted invocationsRescue and assistance package for Indonesia= The first instance of a non-governmental attempt to put an issue before the Constitutional Tribunal came from Non- constituency Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam. He challenged the constitutionality of Singapore's US$5 billion loan offer to Indonesia in November 1997 on the basis of Article 144(1) of the Constitution which states: \\"No guarantee or loan shall be given or raised by the Government, except under the authority of any resolution of Parliament with which the President concurs.\\" Jeyaretnam interpreted this to mean that the giving of a loan required parliamentary and presidential approval.. The Finance Minister Dr. Richard Hu Tsu Tau did not agree with Jeyaretnam's interpretation of the provision, and stated that the Attorney-General had given advice that the granting of loans and the purchase of securities of this type had the prior approval of two Presidents.. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance stated that Article 144(1) applied only to the giving of guarantees or the raising of loans by the Government, and not the giving of loans. The Attorney-General Chan Sek Keong confirmed that this reading of the provision, which he characterized as reddendo singula singulis (Latin for \\"referring each to each\\"), was correct.. The Attorney-General also suggested that Jeyaretnam bring the matter to the Tribunal,. a procedure seemingly inconsistent with a rule which stipulates that a reference to the Tribunal shall be made under the hand of the President of Singapore.RC, O. 58 r. 2(2). This issue was finally abandoned when Jeyaretnam refused to pay for the costs for referring the matter to the Tribunal and the Ministry of Law found it ludicrous that it was asked by Jeyaretnam to bear the costs. =Public Entertainments Act= On 20 January 1999, Jeyaretnam wrote to President Ong Teng Cheong requesting the reference of another constitutional question to the Tribunal. This was made on behalf of his client, opposition politician Chee Soon Juan, who had been charged for giving a public talk on 20 December 1999 without a licence under the Public Entertainments Act.Public Entertainments Act (Cap. 257, 1985 Rev. Ed.), now the . The question involved the constitutionality of the Act. Jeyaretnam argued that the Act violated Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution, which enshrines freedom of speech and assembly. The President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, turned down the request. The reply to Jeyaretnam dated 29 January 1999 pronounced the request as \\"misconceived\\". The following reasons were given: *The jurisdiction of the Tribunal should only be invoked \\"when there is no other forum available to a person who claims that his constitutional rights have been infringed to have such claim tested\\". The Tribunal was not a court of law, but only advisory in nature. Chee would be able to raise the same constitutional question at trial or on appeal as he had been charged under the Act. *If the Tribunal were to come into the picture when the court had yet to resolve the matter, then this would \\"constitute an improper interference with the judicial power of the courts and the constitutional functions of the Public Prosecutor\\".. =Misuse of Drugs Act= A plea for a review by the Constitutional Tribunal was sought as a last-ditch attempt to stave off the execution of drug trafficker Shanmugam Murugesu. Shanmugam's lawyer contended that his client's right to equal protection under Article 12 of the Constitution had been infringed. Referring to cases of six recent offenders similarly convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act,, ss. 18 and 21. Shanmugam's lawyer drew attention to the fact that those offenders had imported more than 700 grammes of cannabis, an offence which attracted the death penalty, but were eventually charged with possessing less than 500 grammes of cannabis which resulted only in a jail sentence. In contrast, Shanmugam, who had imported 1,029.8 grammes of cannabis, did not have the amount reduced and was sentenced to death. The plea was rejected by the President on 12 May 2005, one day before the execution date.. =Legal status of the right to vote= Speaking in Parliament on 12 February 2009, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann posed the question of whether the right to vote is a constitutional one and suggested that the Law Minister obtain an advisory opinion to clarify the point. This issue was briefly dealt with by the Minister who simply answered it in the affirmative, rendering the need for a resolution by the constitutional tribunal nugatory. Thio subsequently expressed the view that it would be desirable to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to give its authoritative opinion as the courts are the final arbiter on questions of constitutionality in Singapore..

Article 9 of the Constitution guarantees the rights to life and personal liberty and other rights of arrested persons, but these rights are not absolute. Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, specifically Article 9(1), guarantees the right to life and the right to personal liberty. The Court of Appeal has called the right to life the most basic of human rights, but has yet to fully define the term in the Constitution. Contrary to the broad position taken in jurisdictions such as Malaysia and the United States, the High Court of Singapore has said that personal liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention. Article 9(1) states that persons may be deprived of life or personal liberty \\"in accordance with law\\". In Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980), an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from Singapore, it was held that the term law means more than just legislation validly enacted by Parliament, and includes fundamental rules of natural justice. Subsequently, in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal held that such fundamental rules of natural justice embodied in the Constitution are the same in nature and function as common law rules of natural justice in administrative law, except that they operate at different levels of the legal order. A related decision, Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010), apparently rejected the contention that Article 9(1) entitles courts to examine the substantive fairness of legislation, though it asserted a judicial discretion to reject bills of attainder and absurd or arbitrary legislation. In the same case, the Court of Appeal held that law in Article 9(1) does not include rules of customary international law. Other subsections of Article 9 enshrine rights accorded to persons who have been arrested, namely, the right to apply to the High Court to challenge the legality of their detention, the right to be informed of the grounds of arrest, the right to counsel, and the right to be produced before a magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. These rights do not apply to enemy aliens or to persons arrested for contempt of Parliament. The Constitution also specifically exempts the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (), the Internal Security Act (), and Part IV of the Misuse of Drugs Act () from having to comply with Article 9. Text of Article 9 Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. guarantees to all persons the right to life and right to personal liberty. It states: Article 9(1) embodies the concept of the rule of law, an early expression of which was the 39th article of the Magna Carta of 1215: \\"No freeman shall be taken captive or imprisoned, or deprived of his lands, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed, nor will we go with force against him nor send forces against him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.\\"The version in force in the UK is Article 29 of the Magna Carta reissued by Edward I of England in 1297, which reads: \\"No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.\\": Magna Carta 1297 (1297 c. 9). Article 9(1) is similar, but by no means identical, to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits any state from denying \\"any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\\", and to Article 21 of the Constitution of India which states: \\"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.\\" Article 5(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia and Singapore's Article 9(1) are worded the same way as the latter was adopted in 1965 from the former following Singapore's independence from Malaysia., s. 6(1). Rights to life and personal liberty=Meaning of life Article 9(1) in the 1999 Reprint of the Constitution of Singapore, which prohibits the deprivation of life or personal liberty save in accordance with law In Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010),Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor [2010] 3 S.L.R. [Singapore Law Reports] 489, Court of Appeal (Singapore). the Court of Appeal of Singapore called the right to life \\"the most basic of human rights\\".Yong Vui Kong, p. 528, para. 84. This case is elaborated upon in the \\"Meaning of save in accordance with law\\" section below. However, the courts have not yet had the opportunity to define the term life in Article 9(1). Jurisdictions such as India, Malaysia and the United States interpret the same term in their respective constitutions broadly. In the United States Supreme Court case Munn v. Illinois (1877),Munn v. Illinois , Supreme Court (United States). Justice Stephen Johnson Field stated that the term life means more than mere animal existence. Rather, the definition extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. His rationale was that the term should not be \\"construed in any narrow or restricted sense\\".Munn, p. 142. Indian courts have likewise adopted a broad interpretation of life in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution to mean more than mere existence ‚Äì instead, it includes the right to livelihoodOlga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corp. A.I.R. 1986 S.C. 180, Supreme Court (India); and Delhi Transport Corp. v. D.T.C. Mazdoor Congress A.I.R. 1991 S.C. 101, S.C. (India). and the right to a healthy environment. Subsequently, in Samatha v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1997),Samatha v. State of Andhra Pradesh A.I.R. 1997 S.C. 3297, S.C. (India). the meaning of life was expanded to include the right to live with human dignity; and to the provision of minimum sustenance, shelter, and those other rights and aspects of life that make life meaningful and worth living. Similarly, Justice Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati held in Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India (1984)Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India A.I.R. 1984 S.C. 802, S.C. (India). that the expression life included the right to be free from exploitation, and to the basic essentials of life included in the Directive Principles of State Policy that appear in the Indian Constitution.Bandhua Mukti Morcha, pp. 811‚Äì812. In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996),Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan [1996] 1 M.L.J. 261, Court of Appeal (Malaysia). the appellant had appealed against his wrongful dismissal from employment on the grounds of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life.Tan Tek Seng, p. 288. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment,The court in Tan Tek Seng cited Chief Justice Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud in Olga Tellis who stated at p. 193: \\"An equally important facet of that right is the right to livelihood because, no person can live without the means of living, that is, the means of livelihood. If the right to livelihood is not treated as a part of the constitutional right to life, the easiest way of depriving a person of his right to life would be to deprive him of his means of livelihood to the point of abrogation.\\" See Tan Tek Seng, p. 289. and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.Tan Tek Seng, p. 289. The Yong Vui Kong case suggests that Singapore courts may interpret the word life more narrowly than the Indian and Malaysian courts when called upon to do so. The Court of Appeal stated that the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution had been expanded by the Indian courts to include \\"numerous rights relating to life, such as the right to education, the right to health and medical care and the right to freedom from noise pollution\\", attributing this to the \\"pro-active approach of the Indian Supreme Court in matters relating to the social and economic conditions of the people of India\\".Yong Vui Kong (2010), p. 528, para. 83. The Court declined to apply Mithu v. State of Punjab,Mithu v. State of Punjab A.I.R. 1983 S.C. 473, S.C. (India). in which the mandatory death penalty had been found unconstitutional, stating it was \\"not possible\\" to interpret Singapore's Article 9(1) in the way that the Indian Supreme Court had interpreted Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. Meaning of personal liberty Lo Pui Sang v. Mamata Kapildev Dave (2008)Lo Pui Sang v. Mamata Kapildev Dave [2008] 4 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 754, High Court (Singapore). took a narrow approach to the reading of personal liberty in Article 9(1). The High Court of Singapore held that personal liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention, and does not include a liberty to contract. Although it was suggested this had always been the understanding of the term, no authority was cited.Lo Pui Sang, p. 760, para. 6. The approach taken in Lo Pui Sang can be compared to the more liberal interpretation of liberty in the United States and Malaysia. In the US Supreme Court case of Allgeyer v. Louisiana (1897),Allgeyer v. Louisiana , S.C. (United States). where a Louisiana statute was struck down on the ground that it violated an individual's right to contract, it was held that liberty in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution meant not only the right of the citizen to be free from any physical restraint of his person, but also the right to freely enjoy all his faculties ‚Äì that is, to be free to use them in all lawful ways; to live and work where he will; to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any livelihood or avocation; and for that purpose to enter into all contracts that may be proper, necessary, and essential to his carrying out those purposes.Allgeyer, p. 589. Liberty was accorded the same broad reading in the subsequent case Meyer v. Nebraska (1923),Meyer v. Nebraska , S.C. (United States). in which the Supreme Court held that a state statute mandating that English be the only language used in schools was unconstitutional as it infringed on the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court stated that liberty It was held in the Malaysian Court of Appeal case of Sugumar Balakrishnan v. Pengarah Imigresen Negeri Sabah (1998)Sugumar Balakrishnan v. Pengarah Imigresen Negeri Sabah [1998] 3 M.L.J. 289, C.A. (Malaysia). that the term life in Article 5(1) of the Constitution is not limited to mere existence, but is a wide concept that must receive a broad and liberal interpretation. Likewise, personal liberty should be similarly interpreted, as any other approach to construction will necessarily produce an incongruous and absurd result.Sugumar, p. 305. On the facts, personal liberty extended to the liberty of an aggrieved person to go to court and seek judicial review, and thus a statutory provision that sought to oust the power of judicial review was apparently inconsistent with this fundamental liberty. However, the apparent inconsistency could be resolved by permitting an ouster clause to immunize from judicial review only those administrative acts and decisions that are not infected by an error of law.Sugumar, p. 308. Although the Federal Court reversed the Court of Appeal on this point,In Pihak Berkuasa Negeri Sabah v. Sugumar Balakrishnan [2002] 3 M.L.J. 72, Federal Court, Malaysia. in the subsequent case Lee Kwan Woh v. Public Prosecutor (2009)Lee Kwan Woh v. Public Prosecutor [2009] 5 M.L.J. 301, F.C. (Malaysia). the Federal Court held that the provisions of the Constitution should be interpreted \\"generously and liberally\\", and that \\"on no account should a literal construction be placed on its language, particularly upon those provisions that guarantee to individuals the protection of fundamental rights\\".Lee Kwan Woh, p. 311, para. 8. In its view: The Federal Court went on to state that personal liberty \\"includes other rights\\" such as the right to \\"cross the frontiers in order to enter or leave the country when one so desires\\".Lee Kwan Woh, p. 314, para. 14, citing Government of Malaysia v. Loh Wai Kong [1978] 2 M.L.J. 175 at 178, H.C. (Malaysia). It has been suggested that since Article 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution is pitched at a high level of generality,. there is no limitation in the ordinary natural meaning of the phrase. Thus, there is no requirement in the Constitution for personal liberty to be construed narrowly to mean only freedom from physical restraint.Lee, p. 191. Lee notes at p. 190 that in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor [1980] UKPC 32, [1981] A.C. 648, [1979‚Äì1980] S.L.R.(R.) 710, Privy Council (on appeal from Singapore), Lord Diplock indicated that the Constitution should not be treated as ordinary legislation but as \\"sui generis, calling for principles of interpretation of its own, suitable to its character\\": Ong Ah Chuan [1979‚Äì1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 721, para. 23, citing Minister of Home Affairs v. Fisher [1979] UKPC 21, [1980] A.C. 319 at 329, P.C. (on appeal from Bermuda). Meaning of save in accordance with law The meaning of the word law in Article 9(1) has a direct bearing on the scope of the Article. If law is read broadly (for example, as incorporating customary international law principles), the scope of the fundamental liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, law is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted. =Fundamental rules of natural justice= Up to October 2009, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council met at Downing Street (pictured) in the Council Chamber. In a 1980 case on appeal from Singapore, the Privy Council held that the term law in provisions of the Singapore Constitution such as Article 9 included fundamental rules of natural justice. In the Malaysian case Arumugam Pillai v. Government of Malaysia (1976),Arumugam Pillai v. Government of Malaysia [1975] 2 M.L.J. 29, F.C. (Malaysia). the Federal Court construed the phrase save in accordance with law in Article 13(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia restrictively. This provision states: \\"No person shall be deprived of property save in accordance with law.\\" The Court held that all that was required for the legislation in question to be constitutional was for it to have been validly passed by Parliament. Hence, the validity of any duly enacted piece of legislation could not be questioned on grounds of reasonableness, no matter how arbitrary the law appeared to be.Arumugam Pillai, p. 30. However, in 1980 the Privy Council rejected this interpretation in the case of Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor, a decision on appeal from Singapore. This appeal questioned the constitutional validity of section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (\\"MDA\\"). and one of the issues that had to be decided was the interpretation of the word law in Article 9(1). The Public Prosecutor contended that law should be given a narrow meaning. He argued that However, the Public Prosecutor qualified the statement by providing a limitation, namely, that \\"the arbitrariness, the disregard of fundamental rules of natural justice for which the Act provides, must be of general application to all citizens of Singapore so as to avoid falling foul of the anti-discriminatory provisions of Art 12(1)\\". In a judgment delivered by Lord Diplock, the Privy Council rejected this interpretation, finding the Public Prosecutor's argument fallacious. Reading the definition of written law as stated in Article 2(1) together with Article 4, which provides that \\"any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void\\", their Lordships held that \\"the use of the expression 'law' in Art 9(1) ... does not, in the event of challenge, relieve the court of its duty to determine whether the provisions of an Act of Parliament passed after 16 September 1963 and relied upon to justify depriving a person of his life or liberty are inconsistent with the Constitution and consequently void\\".Ong Ah Chuan, [1981] 1 A.C. at p. 670, [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 722, para. 25. In line with their view that Part IV of the Constitution should be given \\"a generous interpretation ... suitable to give to individuals the full measure of the [fundamental liberties] referred to\\",Ong Ah Chuan, [1981] 1 A.C. at p. 670, [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 721, para. 23. their Lordships held that \\"references to 'law' in such contexts as 'in accordance with law', 'equality before the law', 'protection of the law' and the like ... refer to a system of law which incorporates those fundamental rules of natural justice that had formed part and parcel of the common law of England that was in operation in Singapore at the commencement of the Constitution\\".Ong Ah Chuan, [1981] 1 A.C. at p. 670, [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 722, para. 26. This conception of the meaning of law in Article 9(1) has been affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor (2005)Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor [2004] SGCA 47, [2005] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 103 at 125, para. 82, C.A. (Singapore), archived from the original on 15 November 2010. and Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010).Yong Vui Kong (2010), pp. 499‚Äì500, para. 14. It has been highlighted that this elevation of principles of natural justice to constitutional status, with the implication that they may override local statutes due to the supremacy of the Constitution over them, creates some tension with Article 38 which vests the law-making power of Singapore in the legislature.. Extent of natural justice In Ong Ah Chuan and the subsequent decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor (1981),Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor [1981] UKPC 23, [1982] A.C. 136, [1981‚Äì1982] S.L.R.(R.) 133, P.C. (on appeal from Singapore). the Privy Council declined to set out a comprehensive list of fundamental rules of natural justice and merely stated some principles to deal with the issues at hand. At a 2000 conference, the Attorney-General Chan Sek Keong, who became Chief Justice in 2006, remarked that this gives the Court of Appeal a free hand to determine the scope of the fundamental rules of natural justice unencumbered by precedent.. Guidance as to the scope of fundamental rules of natural justice was provided in Haw Tua Tau. First, the Privy Council said that rules of natural justice are not stagnant and may change with the times. Secondly, they should be considered in the local context, in light of the entire system as a whole and from the perspective of the people operating the system.Haw Tua Tau, [1982] A.C. at p. 154, [1981‚Äì1982] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 144, paras. 25‚Äì26. Further, in order to satisfy the rules of natural justice, the law in question should not be \\"obviously unfair\\".Haw Tua Tau, [1982] A.C. at p. 148, [1981‚Äì1982] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 137, para. 8. In its view, under a system of justice in which the court is invested with partly inquisitorial functions, compelling an accused to answer questions put to him by a judge cannot be regarded as contrary to natural justice.Haw Tua Tau, [1982] A.C. at p. 154, [1981‚Äì1982] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 144, para. 25. The Court of Appeal later ruled in Public Prosecutor v. Mazlan bin Maidun (1992)Public Prosecutor v. Mazlan bin Maidun [1992] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 968, C.A. (Singapore). that the privilege against self- incrimination was not a fundamental rule of natural justice, and thus not a constitutional right. In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011),. the Court of Appeal stated that fundamental rules of natural justice embodied in the concept of law in constitutional provisions such as Articles 9(1) and 12(1) are the same in nature and function as common law rules of natural justice in administrative law, except that they operate at different levels of the legal order. The former invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality and can only be altered by amending the Constitution, while the latter invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles and can be abrogated or disapplied by ordinary legislation.Yong Vui Kong (2011), pp. 1242‚Äì1243, paras. 104‚Äì105. A procedural or substantive concept? Traditionally, at common law, natural justice is taken to be a procedural concept that embodies the twin pillars of audi alteram partem (hear the other party) and nemo iudex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his or her own cause). In the United States, due process has both procedural and substantive components. Substantive due process involves the courts assessing the reasonableness of executive actions and legislation using rational basis review if a fundamental right is not implicated and strict scrutiny if it is. The question thus arises whether substantive fundamental rules of natural justice may be developed by local courts. However, a line of Malaysian cases has expressed the view that the concept of substantive due process is not applicable to Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1).See Public Prosecutor v. Datuk Harun bin Haji Idris [1976] 2 M.L.J. 116, High Court (Kuala Lumpur); Attorney-General, Malaysia v. Chiow Thiam Guan [1983] 1 M.L.J. 51, H.C. (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia); Public Prosecutor v. Lau Kee Hoo [1983] 1 M.L.J. 157, F.C. (Malaysia); Public Prosecutor v. Yee Kim Seng [1983] 1 M.L.J. 252, H.C. (Ipoh, Malaysia); and Che Ani bim Itam v. Public Prosecutor [1984] 1 M.L.J. 113, F.C. (Malaysia). There is also academic commentary that rejects the notion of \\"substantive natural justice\\", arguing that it is too vague and leads to problems in application.. Another argument against substantive natural justice is the fear that it may become an avenue for judges to invalidate laws on the basis of their own subjective opinions, leading to unbounded judicial activism. On the other hand, it has also been suggested that substantive natural justice would merely be a full exercise of the judiciary's proper role as conferred by the Constitution.. In addition, one scholar has asserted that there is no doubt that a judicial inquiry covers both substantive and procedural aspects. It is said that Article 9(1) connotes a judicial inquiry into the \\"fairness\\" of the law tested against certain principles regarded as fundamental to the legal system. Distinguishing between substantive and procedural fairness is a meaningless exercise, as it merely clouds the process of judicial inquiry. Judicial review is judicial review under whatever name, and as far as Article 9(1) is concerned, there is no room for making this distinction.. However, in Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010) the Court of Appeal appeared to reject such an approach by declining to require that procedural laws must be \\"fair, just and reasonable\\"The approach taken to Article 21 of the Indian Constitution in Mithu, para. 6. before they can be regarded as law for the purpose of Article 9(1). It noted that the provision neither contains such a qualification, nor can such a qualification be implied from its context or wording. The Court considered it \\"too vague a test of constitutionality\\" and said: \\"Such a test hinges on the court‚Äôs view of the reasonableness of the law in question, and requires the court to intrude into the legislative sphere of Parliament as well as engage in policy making.\\"Yong Vui Kong (2010), pp. 526‚Äì527, para. 80. On the other hand, the Court acknowledged that Article 9(1) does not justify all legislation whatever its nature.Citing Ong Ah Chuan, [1980] A.C. at 659. It held, obiter, that law might not encompass colourable legislation (that is, bills of attainder ‚Äì legislation purporting to be of general application but in fact directed at securing the conviction of particular individuals), or legislation \\"of so absurd or arbitrary a nature that it could not possibly have been contemplated by our constitutional framers as being 'law' when they crafted the constitutional provisions protecting fundamental liberties\\".Yong Vui Kong (2010), p. 500, para. 16; see also pp. 524‚Äì525, para. 75. =Customary international law= The United Nations General Assembly hall in New York. The Singapore Court of Appeal acknowledged in a 2004 case that Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the General Assembly in 1948, prohibits torture and cruel and inhumane treatment, and that this is considered customary international law. However, what constitutes \\"cruel and inhumane treatment\\" remains unclear. In Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor (2004), the Court of Appeal considered whether law in Article 9(1) includes principles of customary international law. In that case, the appellant argued that effecting a death sentence for drug trafficking by hanging is unconstitutional as a form of cruel and inhuman punishment not \\"in accordance with law\\". The Court agreed that there was a prohibition against torture and cruel and inhumane treatment in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that this is considered customary international law. However, a customary international law rule had to be \\"clearly and firmly established\\" before it was adopted by the courts,Nguyen Tuong Van, pp. 126‚Äì127, para. 88. and there was insufficient practice among states to hold that death by hanging was within the ambit of this prohibition. Also, even if there was a customary international law rule against death by hanging, domestic statutes would prevail in the event of conflict.Nguyen Tuong Van, p. 128, para. 94. The Court of Appeal clarified in Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010), that customary international law cannot be read into the Constitution for two reasons. First, in order for a customary international law rule to have legal effect in Singapore, it has to be incorporated into domestic law. The incorporation can occur either by enactment in a statuteIn which case the rule will be regarded as part of domestic legislation and no longer a customary international law rule: Yong Vui Kong (2010), p. 530, para. 89. or by a court declaration that the rule forms part of the common law. The Court felt it would be incorrect to incorporate customary international law rules into the meaning of law in Article 9(1) as this would cloak the common law with the constitutional status to nullify a statute, thus reversing the usual hierarchy of legal rules.Yong Vui Kong (2010), p. 530, para. 90. Secondly, the term law is defined in Article 2(1) to include the common law only \\"in so far as it is in operation in Singapore\\". However, a court cannot treat rules of customary international law as having been incorporated into Singapore common law if they are inconsistent with existing statutes. Furthermore, if there is a conflict between such a rule and a domestic statute, the latter prevails.Yong Vui Kong (2010), p. 531, para. 91; . The Court of Appeal also held that since a significant number of nations still retain the mandatory death penalty for drug-related offences and other serious crimes, it had not been established that customary international law prohibited the imposition of the mandatory death penalty: Yong Vui Kong (2010), p. 533, para. 96. Further, a customary international law rule prohibiting the mandatory death penalty cannot be regarded as part of law in Article 9(1) of the Constitution because the Government of Singapore rejected a recommendation to include a prohibition against inhuman punishment in the Constitution in 1966: p. 531, para. 92. The Constitution is silent as to the reception of international law in domestic law.. In Yong Vui Kong the Court of Appeal accepted that domestic law, including the Constitution, should \\"as far as possible\\" be consistently interpreted with Singapore's international obligations. Nonetheless, while international human rights law can increase the normative pool judges may resort to in interpreting the Constitution, there are \\"inherent limits\\" such as the express wording of the constitutional text and constitutional history that \\"[militates] against the incorporation of those international norms\\".Yong Vui Kong (2010), p. 519, para. 59; Thio, \\"Little Known Legal Fact\\", p. 569. It has also been argued that although where possible local statutes should be interpreted in light of international treaties, it is not the role of the judiciary to import international law standards into the Constitution that are inconsistent with legislation instead of deferring to the views of the executive. According to this view, which hinges on a strict adherence to the separation of powers doctrine, the judiciary should guard against unwarranted incursions into the executive sphere, as it is for the executive to determine Singapore's attitude and position in relation to foreign affairs. The judiciary must not undertake its task of interpreting the Constitution arbitrarily, but should accord with legal reasoning and sound principles.Lim, \\"The Constitution and the Reception of Customary International Law\\", p. 230. This necessarily raises the question of what the applicable legal principle during the interpretation process should be. It has been suggested that the executive and the judiciary should show solidarity by speaking with \\"one voice\\",. and that the courts should exercise deference in favour of what the executive deems to be the nation's attitude towards the particular international law norm that is sought to be applied.Lim, \\"The Constitution and the Reception of Customary International Law\\", p. 233. It may be submitted that such judicial deference to the executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, it is crucial that the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.Lim, \\"The Constitution and the Reception of Customary International Law\\", p. 231. A diagrammatic representation of legal developments in the meaning of the phrase save in accordance with law in Article 9(1) up to 2010 Application=Right to lifeAbortion= One of the most difficult questions involving the right to life is when exactly life begins and ends. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it should be accorded the right to life under the Constitution. Laws permitting abortion would thus be unconstitutional.For instance, see This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts. In Singapore, the Penal Code, ss. 313‚Äì316. lays out sanctions for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, (\\"TPA\\"). which limits abortion to women who have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks.TPA, s. 4(a). Compare the Malaysian Penal Code (Act 574, 2006 Rev. Ed.), s. 312, which states that abortion is permissible within 120 days of conception only if the pregnancy poses a threat to an expectant mother's physical or mental health: see . By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception.Constitution of the Philippines, Art. II, s. 12. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth.Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms 1992 (Czech Republic), Art. 6. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life. =Right to die= In Singapore, attempted suicide,Penal Code, s. 309. abetment of suicide, and abetment of attempted suicidePenal Code, s. 309 read with s. 107 (abetment); and s. 306 (abetment of suicide). are criminal acts. This applies to physicians who aid patients in ending their lives. Such physicians are unable to claim a defence under section 88 of the Penal Code since they intended to cause the patients' deaths.Penal Code, s. 88, reads: \\"Nothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent.\\" (Emphasis added.) However, physicians are absolved of liability if patients refuse treatment for terminal illnesses by issuing advance medical directives., s. 20(1). Nothing in the Act authorizes an act that causes or accelerates death as distinct from an act that permits the dying process to take its natural course; or condones, authorizes or approves abetment of suicide or euthanasia: s. 17. Whether the right to life guaranteed by Article 9(1) encompasses a right to die ‚Äì that is, a right to commit suicide or a right to assisted suicide, usually in the face of a terminal illness ‚Äì has not been the subject of any Singapore court case. In other jurisdictions, the right to life has generally not been interpreted in this way. In Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab (1996)Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab A.I.R. 1996 S.C. 1257, S.C. (India). the Indian Supreme Court held that the right to life is a natural right embodied in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, and since suicide is an unnatural termination or extinction of life it is incompatible and inconsistent with the concept of the right to life.Gian Kaur, para. 22. The US Supreme Court has also declined to recognize that choosing death is a right protected by the Constitution. In Washington v. Glucksberg (1997),Washington v. Glucksberg , S.C. (United States). a group of Washington residents asserted that a state law banning assisted suicideWash. Rev. Code Ann. ¬ß9A.36.060(1): \\"A person is guilty of promoting a suicide attempt when he knowingly causes or aids another person to attempt suicide.\\" was unconstitutional on its face. The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Several of the justices seemed persuaded that the availability of palliative care to \\"alleviate suffering, even to the point of causing unconsciousness and hastening death\\"Glucksberg, p. 737. outweighed recognizing a new unenumerated \\"right to commit suicide which itself includes a right to assistance in doing so\\".Glucksberg, p. 723. Right to personal libertyRights of arrested persons= Changi Prison Complex. Article 9 provides that arrested persons have a right to challenge the legality of their detention, to be informed of the grounds of their arrest, to consult counsel, and to be produced before a magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. Article 9(2) of the Constitution enshrines the right of persons who have been detained to apply to the High Court challenging the legality of their detention. The application is for an order for review of detention, which was formerly called a writ of habeas corpus.The application procedure is governed by Order 54 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5, 2006 Rev. Ed.). The Court is required to inquire into the complaint, and order the detainee to be produced before the Court and released unless it is satisfied that the detention is lawful.Constitution, Art. 9(2). Article 9(3) requires that an arrested person be informed \\"as soon as may be\\" of the grounds of his arrest. Article 9(4) goes on to provide that if the arrested person is not released he must, without unreasonable delay, and in any case within 48 hours (excluding the time of any necessary journey) be produced before a magistrate and cannot be further detained in custody without the authority of the magistrate. The person's attendance before the magistrate may be in person or by way of video-conferencing or other similar technology in accordance with law. Right to counsel Article 9(3) also states that an arrested person must be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. Restrictions on the rights to life and personal liberty As mentioned above, Parliament is entitled to restrict the rights to life and personal liberty as long as it acts \\"in accordance with law\\". More specific restrictions on Article 9 include Article 9(5), which provides that Articles 9(3) and (4) of the Constitution do not apply to enemy aliens or to persons arrested for contempt of Parliament pursuant to a warrant issued by the Speaker. Detention under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act Article 9(6) saves any law :(a) in force before the commencement of the Constitution authorizing the arrest and detention of any person in the interests of public safety, peace and good order; or :(b) relating to the misuse of drugs or intoxicating substances which authorizes the arrest and detention of any person for treatment and rehabilitation, from being invalid because of inconsistency with Articles 9(3) and (4). This provision took effect on 10 March 1978 but was expressed to apply to laws in force prior to that date. Introduced by the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1978,. the provision immunizes the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (\\"CLTPA\\"). and Part IV of the Misuse of Drugs Act from unconstitutionality. Preventive detention is the use of executive power to detain individuals on the basis that they are predicted to commit future crimes that will threaten national interest.. Among other things, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act empowers the Minister for Home Affairs, if satisfied that a person has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, to order that he or she be detained for a period not exceeding 12 months if the Minister is of the view that the detention is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.CLTPA, s. 30. Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau may order drug addicts to undergo drug treatment or rehabilitation at an approved institution for renewable six-month periods up to a maximum of three years.MDA, s. 34. Detention under the Internal Security Act Section 8(1) of Singapore's Internal Security Act (\\"ISA\\") (\\"ISA\\"). gives the Minister for Home Affairs the power to detain a person without trial for any period not exceeding two years on the precondition that the President is: \\"satisfied ... that ... it is necessary to do so ... with a view to preventing that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore ... or to the maintenance of public order or essential services therein\\". The period of detention may be renewed by the President indefinitely for periods not exceeding two years at a time as long as the grounds for detention continue to exist.ISA, s. 8(2). The ISA has its constitutional basis in Article 149 of the Constitution, which sanctions preventive detention and allows for laws passed by the legislature against subversion to override the Articles protecting the personal liberties of the individual.. Specifically, Article 149(1) declares such legislation to be valid notwithstanding any inconsistency with five of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution, including Article 9.The other provisions are Arts. 11, 12, 13 and 14. Thus, detentions under the ISA cannot be challenged on the basis of deprivation of these rights.. NotesReferences=Cases *Ong Ah Chuan v.

An act or statement that alleges bias, lack of impartiality, impropriety or any wrongdoing concerning a judge in the exercise of his judicial function falls within the offence. The High Court and the Court of Appeal are empowered by section 7(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act () to punish for contempt of court. This provision is statutory recognition of the superior courts' inherent jurisdiction to uphold the proper administration of justice. The Subordinate Courts are also empowered by statute to punish acts of contempt. Although Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore protects every citizen's right to freedom of speech and expression, the High Court has held that the offence of scandalizing the court falls within the category of exceptions from the right to free speech expressly stipulated in Article 14(2)(a). Some commentators have expressed the view that the courts have placed excessive value on protecting the independence of the judiciary, and have given insufficient weight to free speech. In Singapore, an \\"inherent tendency\\" test has been held to strike the right balance between the right to freedom of speech and the need to protect the dignity and integrity of the courts. To establish the offence, the claimant must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or words complained of have an inherent tendency to interfere with the administration of justice. The inherent tendency test has been held to be justified by the small geographical size of Singapore, the fact that there is no jury system and that judges have to decide both questions of law and fact, and that the test renders proof of damage to the administration of justice unnecessary. Although Singapore law does not set out the sanctions that may be imposed for contempt of court, it is accepted that the courts may impose reasonable fines and imprisonment. To decide what punishment is appropriate, the culpability of the offender and the likely interference with the administration of justice are considered. The only defence available to the offence of scandalizing the court is to prove that the allegedly contemptuous act or statement amounts to fair criticism, which involves showing that the criticism was made respectfully and in good faith. Nature \\"Contempt of court\\" is a generic term descriptive of conduct in relation to particular proceedings in a court of law which tends to undermine that system or to inhibit citizens from availing themselves of it for the settlement of their disputes.Attorney General v. Times Newspapers Ltd. [1974] A.C. [Appeal Cases] 273 at 307, House of Lords, per Lord Diplock, cited in You Xin v. Public Prosecutor [2007] 4 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 17 at 25, para. 15, High Court. Despite the many forms it may take, contempt of court can be divided into two broad categories, contempt by interference and contempt by disobedience., cited in You Xin at pp. 25‚Äì26, para. 16. Scandalizing the court is an example of the first category. It comprises matters such as disrupting the court process itself (contempt in facie curiae ‚Äì in the face of the court), publications or acts which risk prejudicing or interfering with particular legal proceedings, and publications or acts which interfere with the course of justice as a continuing process (for example, publications which \\"scandalize\\" the court). The second category comprises disobeying court orders and breaching undertakings given to the court.You Xin at pp. 25‚Äì26, para. 16. The criminal offence of scandalizing the court is committed by any act done or writing published calculated to bring a court or a judge of the court into contempt, or to lower his authority.R. v. Gray [1900] 2 Q.B. [Queen's Bench] 36 at 40, Queen's Bench Division, per Lord Russell of Killowen, cited in ; and in Attorney-General v. Tan Liang Joo John [2009] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 1132 at 1137‚Äì1138, para. 10, H.C. Any publication which alleges bias, lack of impartiality, impropriety or any wrongdoing concerning a judge in the exercise of his judicial function falls within the offence of scandalizing the court in Singapore.Chee Soon Juan at 661, para. 30. Source of power to punish contempt Fundamentally, the power to punish contempt is not derived from statute or from the common law per se but instead flows from the very raison d'√™tre for a court of law: to uphold the proper administration of justice.You Xin, pp. 30‚Äì31, para. 29. All courts have an inherent jurisdiction to punish contempt committed when the court is in session by invoking a \\"summary process\\", meaning that the judge in front of whom the contemptuous act is committed may speedily order the contemnor to be punished.You Xin, pp. 32‚Äì33, paras. 34‚Äì35. However, inherent jurisdiction to punish contempt committed outside court resides exclusively in the superior courts.R. v. Lefroy (1873) L.R. [Law Reports] 8 Q.B. 134, cited in Chee Soon Juan, p. 655, para. 9. The High Court and the Court of Appeal are empowered by section 7(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. to punish for contempt of court. In a 1991 case, the High Court held that this was statutory recognition of the common law misdemeanour of contempt of court.Attorney-General v. Wain [1991] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 85 at 97, para. 39, H.C. The Subordinate Courts' power to punish acts of contempt can be found principally in two statutes, section 8 of the Subordinate Courts Act,. and section 410 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010.. Constitutionality The 1999 Reprint of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. protects every citizen's right to freedom of speech and expression. This fundamental liberty was derived from the Federal Constitution of Malaysia when Singapore separated from Malaysia with effect from 9 August 1965.Republic of Singapore Independence Act (No. 9 of 1965, 1985 Rev. Ed. ), s. 6(1). The Reid Constitutional Commission of 1957, which recommended that this provision be included in Malaysia's independence constitution, thought that this freedom was an \\"essential condition for a free and democratic way of life\\"., para. 161. However, as such a freedom cannot be unfettered, Article 14(2)(a) of the Singapore Constitution states, inter alia, that Parliament may by law impose on the rights conferred by clause (1)(a) restrictions designed to provide against contempt of court. In 2006, the High Court held in Attorney-General v. Chee Soon Juan that the offence of scandalizing the court falls within the category of exceptions from the right to free speech expressly stipulated in Article 14(2)(a), and that the Article clearly confers on Parliament the power to restrict a person's right of free speech to punish acts of contempt.Chee Soon Juan, p. 660, para. 29. As a democratic society, Singapore has always recognized the need to ensure the independence of the judiciary. As the judiciary acts as a check and balance on the Cabinet and the Parliament, its integrity is of utmost concern in ensuring legitimacy of the Westminster model of governance. It is within this context that, in a 1991 decision, the Court expressed the view that freedom of speech \\"must be balanced against the needs of the administration of justice, one of which is to protect the integrity of the courts\\".Wain, p. 101, para. 56. The rationale for the law of contempt is rooted firmly in the public interest. It aims to protect the administration of justice as well as public confidence in it, which is crucial for the rule of law and the maintenance of law and order in any democratic society. It is not intended to protect the dignity of the courts or judges.Attorney-General v. Hertzberg [2009] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 1103 at 1118, para. 20. When such interference is suppressed, it is because the structure of ordered life is at risk if the judiciary are so flouted and their authority wanes and is supplanted.Times Newspapers, p. 302, cited in Hertzberg, p. 1119, para. 20. Though the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed under the Constitution, it does not mean that anyone is entitled under the guise of that freedom to make irresponsible accusations against the judiciary so as to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.Hertzberg, p. 1119, para. 21. Some commentators have expressed the view that excessive value has been placed by the courts on protecting the independence of the judiciary, and that insufficient weight has been given to the right to freedom of speech. One assumption said to be incorrect is that undermining public confidence in the administration of justice is in all circumstances harmful to the public interest. Arguably, if the scandalizing allegation is true or is an opinion honestly and reasonably held, then it is in the public interest that such speech be heard precisely because of the importance of the judiciary to society.. However, common law rules of contempt do not recognize the defence of either justification or fair comment which are available to the tort of defamation.Wain, p. 101, para. 56; Chee Soon Juan, pp. 664‚Äì665, para. 44‚Äì47. Secondly, the claim that scandalizing the court may undermine public confidence in the judiciary represents an unduly pessimistic view of the maturity and ability of the Singapore public to assess for itself whether or not the scandalizing speech is true, and is perhaps a sweeping statement as to general public awareness.Hor & Seah, p. 309. Lastly, it is also assumed that public confidence in the judiciary can be preserved by the suppression of scandalizing speech. However, it is unlikely that such speech can ever be completely suppressed. It would be impossible to monitor speech that goes on in homes, coffee shops and hawker centres. Through these informal channels, suspicions of the judiciary may fester and grow.Hor & Seah, p. 310. Test for the offence=\\"Real risk\\" test A \\"real risk\\" test applies in many common law countries, including Hong Kong,Wong Yeung Ng v. Secretary of State for Justice [1999] 2 H.K.C. [Hong Kong Cases] 24 at 59, Court of Appeal (Hong Kong). New Zealand,Solicitor-General v. Radio Avon Ltd. [1978] 1 N.Z.L.R. 225 at 229, Court of Appeal (New Zealand). and the United Kingdom.Times Newspapers, p. 299, H.L. See also Ahnee v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] 2 A.C. 294 at 306, P.C. (on appeal from Mauritius).Hertzberg, p. 1125, para. 32. The real risk test requires that a complainant prove that the act or words created a real risk of prejudicing the administration of justice.Tan Liang Joo John, p. 1138, para. 12. See also Ahnee, p. 306: \\"There must be a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice.\\" The main reason for the adoption of the more liberal real risk test in these jurisdictions is the need to protect the right to freedom of speech and expression, as the broader test of inherent tendency is seen to inhibit the right to an unjustifiable degree. \\"Inherent tendency\\" test In Singapore, an \\"inherent tendency\\" test has been held to strike the right balance between the right to freedom of speech and expression, and the need to protect the dignity and integrity of the courts. To establish the offence, it is sufficient if the claimant can prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or words complained of have an inherent tendency to interfere with the administration of justice.Wain, p. 101, para. 54; Chee Soon Juan, p. 661, para. 31; Hertzberg, pp. 1125‚Äì1126, para. 34. An act or statement has such an inherent tendency if it conveys to an average reasonable reader or viewer allegations of bias, lack of impartiality, impropriety or any wrongdoing concerning a judge (and a fortiori, a court) in the exercise of his judicial function.Hertzberg, pp. 1124‚Äì1125, para. 31. Thus, it is scandalizing the court to allege that it can be swayed by external pressures and made servile to others.Gallagher v. Durack (1983) 45 A.L.R. 53 at paras. 55‚Äì56, High Court (Australia), Attorney-General v. Zimmerman [1985‚Äì1986] S.L.R.(R.) 476 at 479, para. 9, H.C.; Attorney-General v. Lingle [1995] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 199 at 202‚Äì203, paras. 3‚Äì8, H.C., cite in Hertzberg, p. 1128, para. 43. The Singapore courts prefer the inherent tendency test to the real risk test on the ground that Singapore's unique conditions necessitate that attacks on the integrity and impartiality of the courts be dealt with more firmly. In the 2009 decision Attorney-General v. Hertzberg, the following justifications for the inherent tendency test were given:Hertzberg, pp. 1125‚Äì1126, para. 33‚Äì34. *Small geographical size. The small geographical size of Singapore renders its courts more susceptible to unjustified attacks.Ahnee, pp. 305‚Äì306, cited in Chee Soon Juan, p. 659, para. 25. *No jury system. Judges in Singapore decide both questions of law and fact, which renders the administration of justice \\"wholly in the hands of judges\\". Thus, any attacks on a judge's impartiality have to be \\"firmly dealt with\\".Wain, pp. 96‚Äì97, para. 38. *Proof of damage unnecessary. The inherent tendency test does not call for detailed proof of what in many instances will be unprovable, namely, that public confidence in the administration of justice was really impaired by the relevant publication. In addition, the test enables the court to step in before the damage ‚Äì the impairment of public confidence in the administration of justice ‚Äì actually occurs.Hertzberg, p. 1125, para. 33. It has been noted that the relevance of Singapore's small geographical size to the application of the inherent tendency test is not self-evident and requires further explanation., para. 1.174. The authority for this proposition was the Privy Council's judgment in an appeal from Mauritius, Ahnee v. Director of Public Prosecutions, where it was said: However, the test for scandalizing the court applied in Ahnee was the real risk and not the inherent tendency test. It has been pointed out that this shows the value of free speech in democratic societies is a factor appropriate to a small island.Thio, \\"Administrative and Constitutional Law\\", p. 53, para. 1.177. Further, the distinction between a legal system which utilizes judges as triers of both law and fact, as opposed to a system which incorporates jury trials, has been termed artificial. In a jurisdiction such as the United Kingdom, the same test applies to both jury and non-jury cases.Hor & Seah, p. 307. Arguably in a non-jury legal system, there is more public interest in ensuring that judges remain accountable to the people. Hence, there should be greater freedom to discuss the manner in which judges carry out their functions.. Finally, it has been said that the preference for the inherent tendency test because it allows the court to take action before the administration of justice is affected should be evaluated carefully, as it may have an undue chilling effect on speech.Thio, \\"Administrative and Constitutional Law\\", p. 53, para. 1.178. Characteristics The offence of scandalizing the court can be committed in various ways, including the following:Tan Liang Joo John, p. 1142, para. 27. *a publication in a print medium; *a television or radio broadcast; *pictures; *physical acts; *spoken words; or *words displayed on a poster. Allegations may scandalize the court by implication and association when contextually perceived by an average person.Tan Liang Joo John, p. 1142, para. 28. For printed publications, the failure to publish a fair or adequate summary of the reasons of the court and/or the omission of crucial facts may scandalize the court.R. v. Fletcher [1935] 52 C.L.R. 248 at 257‚Äì258, cited in Hertzberg, p. 1133, para. 54. The intention of the contemnor is irrelevant in establishing liability for contempt.Wain, p. 98, para. 44.Chee Soon Juan, p. 661, para. 31; Lee Hsien Loong v. Singapore Democratic Party [2009] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 642 at 730, para. 221. Intention only becomes relevant when the court determines the appropriate sentence after having found the contemnor guilty.Lingle, p. 205, para. 15. A publisher has a duty to ensure that his or her publication does not encompass matters that are in contempt of court, even if the contemptuous material in the publication represents the views of a third party and are not held or endorsed by the publisher.Hertzberg, p. 1130, para. 48. Sentencing Singapore law does not set out the sanctions that may be imposed for contempt of court. It is accepted that reasonable fines and imprisonment are permissible.Hertzberg, p. 1136, para. 62. To decide the severity of the punishment, the courts consider the culpability of the offender and the likely interference with the administration of justice. When determining the culpability of the contemnor, the courts may take the following factors into account:Attorney-General v. Zimmerman [1985‚Äì1986] S.L.R.(R.) 476 at 488, para. 50, cited in Hertzberg, pp. 1134‚Äì1135, para. 58. *the nature of the contempt (that is, the seriousness of the imputations); *who the contemnor is; *the degree of his culpability (for instance, whether he is a repeat offender); *how the contempt was published; and *the kind of publication and the extent of the publication (that is, the number of publications over a period of time). Other relevant considerations that may mitigate the severity of the sentence include the conduct of the respondent, for example, whether he argued against culpability, expressed regret over his conduct, and made an apology for his contempt of court. Although the real risk test has no bearing on liability, the likelihood that the respondent's acts or statements pose a real risk of harm to the administration of justice may be relevant for mitigation or aggravation of the punishment. These considerations are non-exhaustive and the importance and relevance of these factors is dependent on the facts of each case, although guidance may be drawn from previous cases.Hertzberg, pp. 1134‚Äì1135, para. 58. Imprisonment is warranted when a contemptuous insult strikes at the \\"foundation, the body and the spirit of the justice system in Singapore\\".Tan Liang Joo John, p. 1145, para. 38. The High Court has reasoned that the rule of law is destabilized when the cornerstones of the judiciary ‚Äì impartiality and independence ‚Äì are attacked.Hertzberg, p. 1135, para. 59. As such, imprisonment serves as a deterrent tool.Tan Liang Joo John, p. 1143, para. 31. Defence of fair criticism The only defence available to the offence of scandalizing the court is to prove that the allegedly contemptuous act or statement amounts to fair criticism. In order for criticism to be considered fair, it must be made in good faith and be respectful. Factors that a court will take into account to determine if the accused was acting in good faith include whether there are arguments and evidence backing up the act or statement, whether it is expressed in a temperate and dispassionate manner, the accused's attitude in court, and the number of instances of contemning conduct.Tan Liang Joo John, pp. 1139‚Äì1140, para. 15‚Äì20. The defences of justification and fair comment are not applicable to the offence of scandalizing the court. The High Court has stated that since a belief published in good faith and not for an ulterior motive can amount to fair comment even though it is not a reasonable belief,Slim v. Daily Telegraph Ltd. [1968] 2 Q.B. 157. permitting the defence of fair comment would \\"expose the integrity of the courts to unwarranted attacks\\", particularly since \\"Singapore judges do not have the habit of issuing public statements to defend themselves ... Our judges feel constrained by their position not to react to criticism and have no official forum in which they can respond\\".Chee Soon Juan, p. 664, para. 46, cited in Hertzberg, pp. 1120‚Äì1121, para. 23. As for justification, it has been said that permitting the defence to be run would \\"give malicious parties an added opportunity to subject the dignity of the courts to more bouts of attacks; that is unacceptable\\".Chee Soon Juan, pp. 664‚Äì665, para. 47, cited in Hertzberg, pp. 1120‚Äì1121, para. 23.

A governmental decision that is Wednesbury-unreasonable may be quashed by the High Court. This type of unreasonableness of public body decisions was laid down in the English case of Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation (1947), where it was said that a public authority acts unreasonably when a decision it makes is \\"so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority\\". Wednesbury unreasonableness was subsequently equated with irrationality by the House of Lords in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case, 1983). These cases have been applied numerous times in Singapore, though in some decisions it is not very clear whether the courts have applied such a stringent standard. In the UK, courts have applied varying standards of scrutiny when assessing whether a governmental decision is Wednesbury-unreasonable, depending on the subject matter and general context of the case. There do not appear to be any Singapore cases adopting an \\"anxious scrutiny\\" standard. On the other hand, a few cases can be said to have applied a \\"light touch\\" standard where questions of public order and security have arisen. There are suggestions in the UK that a doctrine of proportionality should supplant or be merged into the concept of Wednesbury unreasonableness; thus far, such an approach has not been taken up in Singapore. It is said that in holding that a decision is disproportionate, there is a higher danger that the court might be substituting its view for the decision-maker's. Development and application=At common law The High Street of the market town of Wednesbury in the West Midlands, England. A challenge to a decision of the local authority in Wednesbury to ban children under 15 years from going to the cinema on Sundays led to a 1947 case that introduced the concept of Wednesbury unreasonableness. WednesburyPronounced . unreasonableness is a \\"shorthand legal reference\\". to the classical common law judicial approach expounded in the English case of Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation (1947).. In that case, Lord Greene, the Master of the Rolls, described two forms of unreasonableness. First, unreasonableness can be a general description of a public authority doing things that must not be done, such as not directing itself properly in law by considering matters which it is not bound to consider and taking into consideration irrelevant matters. Another type of unreasonableness occurs when a public authority does something that is \\"so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority\\",Wednesbury, p. 229. as illustrated by the dismissal of a teacher because of her red hair. The latter has now come to be termed as Wednesbury unreasonableness. However, Lord Greene recognized that these aspects of unreasonableness are by no means clear, and \\"all these things run into one another\\". Wednesbury unreasonableness was subsequently reformulated by the House of Lords in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case, 1983).. Lord Diplock stated that it applies to a \\"decision which is so outrageous in the defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it\\".GCHQ case, p. 410. Evidently, this is a much higher standard than ordinary unreasonableness. A governmental decision that is Wednesbury-unreasonable may be quashed or invalidated by a court.Which is what the High Court of Singapore did in Mir Hassan bin Abdul Rahman v. Attorney- General [2009] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 134, H.C. (Singapore). In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind (1991),. Lord Ackner said that although the standard of Wednesbury unreasonableness had been criticized as too high:Ex parte Brind, pp. 757‚Äì758. In Singapore Lord Diplock's threefold classification of the grounds of judicial review in the GCHQ case ‚Äì illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety ‚Äì was adopted by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988).Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 525, Court of Appeal (Singapore). Lord Diplock in the GCHQ case preferred to use the term irrationality to describe Wednesbury unreasonableness, and there is some uncertainty as to whether both concepts refer to the same thing. However, Singapore courts have stated that the test for irrationality is that of Wednesbury unreasonableness.The court in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts [1996] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 294, C.A. (Singapore), clearly stated so at p. 306, para. 39. In cases such as Re Siah Mooi Guat (1988),Re Siah Mooi Guat [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 165, H.C. (Singapore). Kang Ngah Wei v. Commander of Traffic Police (2002),Kang Ngah Wei v. Commander of Traffic Police [2002] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 14, H.C. (Singapore). and Mir Hassan bin Abdul Rahman v. Attorney-General (2009), the courts applied the test of irrationality set out in the GCHQ case. The same test for Wednesbury unreasonableness was referred to in other cases like Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997),Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board [1997] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 52 at 79, para. 78, H.C. (Singapore). Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2006),Chee Siok Chin, p. 628, para. 125. and City Developments Ltd. v. Chief Assessor (2008).City Developments Ltd. v. Chief Assessor [2008] 4 S.L.R.(R.) 150 at 156, para. 10, C.A. (Singapore). However, the courts also considered whether the decision-makers had taken irrelevant factors into account in deciding whether the decision was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense.Lines International, pp. 82‚Äì83, para. 86; Chee Siok Chin, p. 628, para. 125; City Developments, p. 159, para. 17. This is not necessarily inconsistent with Wednesbury unreasonableness as Lord Greene said that taking extraneous factors into account could be seen an aspect of such unreasonableness. It has been said that the nuances of the term reasonable may have allowed the UK courts to deal with the merits of grievances rather than questions of legality,. and hence to engage in judicial policy-making.. However, it seems that Singapore courts have so far avoided substituting their opinion for that of decision-makers in applying the Wednesbury test. In Lines International, the High Court clearly noted that in considering Wednesbury unreasonableness courts are not entitled to substitute their views of how the discretion should be exercised, nor is unreasonableness established if the court is of the view that the policy or guideline may not work as effectively as another. This principle has been adopted and emphasized in subsequent cases. In City Developments the court declined to interfere with the Chief Assessor's assessment of the annual value of the applicant's real property for property tax purposes, finding his explanations logical and commonsensical. The courts came to similar conclusions in Chee Siok Chin and Kang Ngah Wei. Levels of scrutiny English cases dealing with Wednesbury unreasonableness demonstrate varying levels of scrutiny. The intensity of judicial review varies with the subject matter of the decision, ranging from \\"anxious scrutiny\\" to \\"light touch\\" review. \\"Anxious scrutiny\\" review \\"Anxious scrutiny\\" review refers to a more stringent level of scrutiny that is applied when the subject matter of a decision by a public authority relates to human rights.. The term originates from the judgment of Lord Bridge of Harwich in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bugdaycay (1986),. where his Lordship said: \\"The most fundamental of human rights is the individual's right to life and when an administrative decision under challenge is said to be one which may put the applicant's life at risk, the basis of the decision must surely call for the most anxious scrutiny\\".Ex parte Bugdaycay, p. 531. This approach can be seen to be in line with the UK judiciary's increasing focus on human rights protection, particularly after the entry into force of the Human Rights Act 1998Human Rights Act 1998 (1998 c. 42), in force on 2 October 2000. in 2000, which permits persons aggrieved by infringements of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) to seek a remedy in domestic law. Essentially, this standard of scrutiny is much easier to satisfy, as it lowers the threshold of what constitutes a decision so outrageous that it may be deemed unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense. Such a \\"rights-based\\" approach allows courts to scrutinize cases involving fundamental human rights more closely, thereby affording greater protection of fundamental liberties.. UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) in the Main Building at Whitehall, London. In 1995, the Court of Appeal held in a case challenging the MoD's policy of discharging homosexual persons that a lower standard of Wednesbury unreasonableness applies when a decision interferes with human rights. An instance of the application of the anxious scrutiny level of review is the 1995 case of R. v. Ministry of Defence, ex parte Smith,. which represents a distillation of principles embodied in decisions previously made by the House of Lords in ex parte Bugdaycay (1986) and ex parte Brind (1991). In ex parte Smith, Smith and three other individuals appealed a Ministry of Defence ruling that mandated the discharge of homosexuals from the service. The court accepted that \\"[t]he more substantial the interference with human rights, the more the court will require by way of justification before it is satisfied that the decision is reasonable\\". This is as long as the decision remains within the range of responses open to a reasonable decision-maker.Ex parte Smith, pp. 554 and 564, citing the submission of David Pannick Q.C., counsel for three of the applicants. The anxious scrutiny standard has not been applied thus far in Singapore. The prevailing judicial philosophy is that of deference to Parliament.. This is despite the courts' general adoption of Lord Diplock's arguably pro-rights stand taken in the case of Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980).Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor [1979‚Äì1980] S.L.R.(R.) 710, [1981] 1 A.C. 648, P.C. (on appeal from Singapore). This Privy Council case stated that judges should give constitutional provisions a generous interpretation to avoid the \\"austerity of tabulated legalism\\" and to provide individuals with their full measure of fundamental liberties.Ong Ah Chuan, [1979‚Äì1980] S.L.R.(R.) at 721, para. 23; [1981] 1 A.C. at 661, citing Minister of Home Affairs v. Fisher [1980] A.C. 319 at 328, P.C. (on appeal from Bermuda). The words \\"austerity of tabulated legalism\\", left unattributed by Lord Wilberforce in Fisher, appear to be those of Stanley Alexander de Smith: see , cited in . The generally deferential stance of the courts shows an inclination towards a strict separation of powers based upon the judiciary's belief that the Parliament is the only organ with the moral legitimacy to decide issues relating to social policy.See Rajeevan Edakalavan v. Public Prosecutor [1998] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 10 at 18‚Äì19, para. 21, H.C. (Singapore), wherein the Chief Justice opined that the judiciary does not have the moral legitimacy to interfere in the affairs of Parliament, considering the fact that the Parliament has been voted into power by the people of Singapore via legitimate voting processes. \\"Light touch\\" review \\"Light touch\\" review demands that only perversity or absurdity amounting to bad faith or misconduct of an extreme kind will satisfy the threshold of unreasonableness.Leyland & Anthony, p. 291. In Nottinghamshire County Council v. Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1985),. the House of Lords held that bad faith or an improper motive or the fact \\"that the consequences of [the decision-maker's] guidance were so absurd that he must have taken leave of his senses\\" must be proven before the court will interfere.Nottinghamshire County Council, p. 247. Such a strict level of scrutiny is commonly applied by courts where matters of public expenditure or government policy are involved, and evidently reflects a \\"high-water mark of judicial self-restraint\\". An apt example is the case of R. v. Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Cheblak (1991).R. v. Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Cheblak [1991] 1 W.L.R. 890, C.A. (England and Wales). This case involved the detention of a foreign citizen living in the UK on the ground of it \\"being conducive to the public good\\" under section 18(1)(b) of the Immigration Act 19711971 c. 77. as his presence would cause an unacceptable national security risk. The court rejected the application for judicial review on the ground that such matters were best left to the government. It would only intervene if the Secretary of State \\"in any way overstepped the limitations upon his authority which are imposed by the law\\" or acted in bad faith.Ex parte Cheblak, p. 907. ICA Building, the present headquarters of the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. In a 1988 case involving the determination by the Minister for Home Affairs that a foreign national was an undesirable immigrant, the High Court of Singapore appeared to apply a light-touch standard. In the Singapore context, there appears to be some implicit suggestion that the light touch test applies to certain cases. The 1988 case of Re Siah Mooi Guat concerning Singapore's immigration policy is illustrative. The applicant was an immigrant denied entry under section 8(3)(k) of the Immigration Act,. as the Minister for Home Affairs considered her an \\"undesirable immigrant\\" based on certain confidential information that had been supplied to the Ministry. The issue was whether there was a basis upon which the Minister could have properly rejected the applicant's appeal, otherwise it might amount to Wednesbury unreasonableness. The GCHQ test of irrationality was citedSiah Mooi Guat, p. 180, para. 37. but it seems that a higher level of scrutiny was exercised. The court declined to require the Minister to disclose the information he had relied on, holding that \\"any information received by the Minister about an alien from any government through official or diplomatic channels, would be information which would not be in the public interest to disclose\\" and that it was for the Minister and not the court to decide whether disclosure was in the public interest.Siah Mooi Guat, pp. 179‚Äì180, para. 36. Ultimately, the Minister \\"had given the applicant's case his personal consideration, and there was no evidence to show that he had acted unfairly\\".Siah Mooi Guat, pp. 181‚Äì182, para. 41. Thus, similar to Cheblak, as long as the Minister had given consideration to the applicant's appeal, the court was reluctant to question the decision as immigration matters are best left to the Government. In Re Wong Sin Yee (2007),Re Wong Sin Yee [2007] 4 S.L.R.(R.) 676, H.C. the applicant had been detained without trial under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. for involvement in criminal activities on the ground that the detention was in the interests of public safety, peace and good order. The High Court concluded that the judicial process was unsuitable for reaching decisions on questions of public safety, peace and good order, and that therefore it was \\"in no position to hold that it has been established that the Minister's exercise of discretion was irrational in the Wednesbury sense\\".Wong Sin Yee, p. 691, para. 46. Therefore, for sensitive issues pertaining to certain government policies in Singapore, it can be inferred that a high threshold is required to find a decision unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense. Where a non-justiciable issue is involved, even where it curtails fundamental liberties, courts will defer to the executive assessment of what the public order or interest demands.Thio, \\"Law and the Administrative State\\", p. 188. Relationship with proportionality A 19th-century balance scale in the Museum of Folk Culture in Waldenbuch, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. It has been suggested in the UK context that a doctrine of proportionality should be applied in place of or merged into Wednesbury unreasonableness. Singapore cases have thus far declined to take such an approach. In the UK, where human rights protected by the ECHR are prima facie infringed, the courts apply a doctrine of proportionality in place of the Wednesbury unreasonableness test. Additionally, proportionality is applied in respect of European Union law. Given these developments, the role of Wednesbury in ordinary administrative law cases has been questioned. It has been suggested that proportionality should supplant unreasonableness as a ground of review. The former has occasionally been regarded as superior to Wednesbury unreasonableness since its \\"emphasis on balance and justification is taken to offer 'a more structured methodology'\\".Leyland & Anthony, p. 308, citing (reprinted as ). Alternatively, it has been suggested that proportionality should merge with Wednesbury unreasonableness. It is said to share much in common with the reasonableness doctrine, as \\"proportionality in the sense of achieving a 'fair balance' has always been an aspect of unreasonableness\\".. As Lord Slynn of Hadley stated in R. (Alconbury Developments Ltd.) v. Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (2001),. \\"trying to keep the Wednesbury principle and proportionality in separate compartments seems ... to be unnecessary and confusing\\".Alconbury, p. 321. This may cause the \\"coherence and comprehensibility\\" of judicial review to suffer.Leyland & Anthony, p. 314. In any event, as Lord Justice of Appeal John Dyson observed in R. (Association of British Civilian Internees: Far East Region) v. Secretary of State for Defence (2003),. \\"the Wednesbury test is moving closer to proportionality and in some cases it is not possible to see any daylight between the two tests ... [T]he result that follows will often be the same whether the test that is applied is proportionality or Wednesbury unreasonableness\\".Association of British Civilian Internees: Far East Region, pp. 1412‚Äì1413, paras. 32 and 34. However, English courts have been cautious about applying proportionality as it is \\"often understood to bring courts much closer to reviewing the merits of a decision\\"Leyland & Anthony, p. 295. than is permitted by the Wednesbury test. In Singapore's context, Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin observed in the Court of Appeal case of Chng Suan Tze that proportionality should be subsumed under irrationality rather than exist as an independent ground of review, such that if a decision \\"on the evidence is so disproportionate as to breach this principle, then ... such a decision could be said to be irrational in that no reasonable authority could have come to such a decision\\".Chng Suan Tze, p. 564, para. 121. This view was subsequently adopted in Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia) Inc. v. Attorney-General (1989).Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia) Inc. v. Attorney-General [1989] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 637 at 669, para. 60, C.A. (Singapore). In the High Court case of Chee Siok Chin, Justice V.K. Rajah, though speaking in the context of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, noted that proportionality is a European jurisprudential concept imported into English law due to UK's treaty obligations, and it has \\"never been part of the common law in relation to the judicial review of the exercise of a legislative and/or an administrative power or discretion. Nor has it ever been part of Singapore law.\\"Chee Siok Chin, p. 616, para. 87. The reason for the judicial reticence in recognizing proportionality as a separate ground of review is due to the fact that the application of \\"any higher test than the Wednesbury test would necessarily involve the court in a decision on the merits\\", as observed by the court in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts (1996).Chan Hiang Leng Colin, p. 308, para. 44.

Article 15 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore guarantees freedom of religion in Singapore. Specifically, Article 15(1) states: \\"Every person has the right to profess and practise his religion and to propagate it.\\" The terms profess, practise and propagate are not defined in the Constitution, but cases from Singapore and other jurisdictions may shed light on their meaning. The word profess in relation to a religion was defined in a 1964 Singapore case not involving the Constitution as meaning \\"to affirm, or declare one's faith in or allegiance to\\". A 2001 Malaysian decision suggested that the profession of religion does not encompass the renunciation of a religion or the profession of an irreligious viewpoint. As regards the word propagate, in 1977 the Supreme Court of India held that it confers on an individual the right to transmit or spread his or her religion by an exposition of its tenets, but not the right to convert another person who holds a pre-existing religious belief to one's own religion. These issues have not yet come before the Singapore courts for determination. On the other hand, in 1999 the Court of Appeal attempted to draw a line between religious practices and secular facts, taking the view that singing the National Anthem and saying the National Pledge were the latter. Thus, rules that compelled a teacher to engage in these activities in an educational institution could not be regarded as having infringed his right to practise his religion. Freedom of religion under Article 15(1) is not absolute as it is qualified by Article 15(4) of the Constitution, which provides that the rights secured by Article 15 do not authorize any act contrary to any general law relating to public order, public health or morality. These limitations upon the freedom of religion are an important aspect of Singapore's secularism. The Singapore courts have interpreted the term public order to be equivalent to the concepts of \\"public peace, welfare and good order\\" referred to in section 24(1)(a) of the , rather than taking the narrower view that public order means freedom from unlawful physical violence. There has also been academic criticism of the fact that the courts have not applied any form of balancing test to determine whether freedom of religion has been reasonably restricted. On the contrary, where national security is said to be involved, the courts have deferred to the Government as to the necessity for the restrictive legislation. The terms public health and morality in Article 15(4) have yet to be judicially interpreted. Text of Article 15 Article 15 in a copy of the 1999 Reprint of the Constitution of Singapore Article 15 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. is entitled \\"Freedom of religion\\" and reads as follows: In Nappalli Peter Williams v. Institute of Technical Education (1999),Nappalli Peter Williams v. Institute of Technical Education [1999] 2 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 529, Court of Appeal (Singapore). the Court of Appeal affirmed that the Constitution generally adopts what is known as accommodative secularism by \\"removing restrictions to one's choice of religious belief\\".Nappalli, p. 537, para. 28. Article 15(1) is in pari materia with Article 11(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia, from which it was adopted following Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965., s. 6(1). The latter states: \\"Every person has the right to profess and practice his religion and, subject to clause (4), to propagate it.\\"Article 11(4) states: \\"State law and in respect of the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and Labuan, federal law may control or restrict the propagation of any religious doctrine or belief among persons professing the religion of Islam.\\" Article 15(1) also contains similarities to Article 25(1) of the Constitution of India: \\"Subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion.\\" Meaning of profess, practise and propagate=Profess The word profess in Article 15(1) is not defined in the Constitution, but the case Re Mohamed Said Nabi, deceased (1964)Re Mohamed Said Nabi, deceased [1965] M.L.J. [Malayan Law Journal] 121, High Court (Singapore). may provide guidance. The issue in the case was the meaning of the word Muslim in the Muslims Ordinance 1957Muslims Ordinance 1957 (No. 25 of 1957). which was defined as \\"a person who professes the religion of Islam\\".Mohamed Said Nabi, para. 8. The High Court held that to come within the definition, one must be shown to be an orthodox Muslim and must have outwardly manifested and practiced Islam; merely having been born into that religion was insufficient. More specifically, Justice F.A. Chua referred to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary and noted that the word profess means \\"to affirm, or declare one's faith in or allegiance to (a religion, principle, God or Saint etc.)\\".Mohamed Said Nabi, para. 9. However, to determine if one has in fact \\"professed\\" a religion, a proper scrutiny of the entire circumstances is necessary. On the facts, the deceased was brought up as a Muslim, married under Muslim rites, and had held Muslim religious ceremonies in his house which he had taken part in. This was strong evidence that he professed the religion of Islam,Mohamed Said Nabi, para. 10. despite the fact that he had also engaged in the heterodox practices of drinking alcohol and eating pork. The judge held that such practices did not amount to a renunciation of the religion,Mohamed Said Nabi, para. 13. and added that someone who had been born into the religion must be held to be a member of that religion unless it is proved he has adopted some other religion.Mohamed Said Nabi, para. 12. The Malaysian interpretation of the term profess in Article 11(1) of the Malaysian Constitution may be relevant as that provision is worded similarly to Article 15(1) of the Singapore Constitution. In Daud bin Mamat v. Majlis Agama Islam (2001),Daud bin Mamat v. Majlis Agama Islam [2001] 2 M.L.J. 390, High Court (Kota Bahru, Malaysia). it was held that the act of exiting one's religion does not fall under the meaning of professing and practising one's religion. In the judge's view, \\"to accept that professing no religion equated to 'a religion' or the 'right to profess and practice it' would stretch the definition in Article 11 too far\\".Daud bin Mamat, p. 402. On the other hand, it might be argued that the freedom to renounce one's religion or to profess not to have a religion is a corollary of the freedom to profess a religion. This issue has not yet come before the Singapore courts for determination. Practise The Constitution is also silent on what constitutes practising a religion for the purposes of Article 15(1). The local courts have defined the word practise by indicating what types of acts are not considered religious practices. In Nappalli, the Court of Appeal held that singing of the National Anthem and reciting the National Pledge were not religious practices but rather expressions of national patriotism, which were secular acts. The Canadian case Donald v. The Board of Education for the City of Hamilton (1945)Donald v. The Board of Education for the City of Hamilton [1945] O.R. 518. was distinguished; in that case, singing the national anthem was held to constitute a religious practice because the anthem contained a prayer hymn which \\"unquestionably reflected some religious character\\".Nappalli, p. 537, para. 25. In Nappalli, the appellant was dismissed from an educational institution for his refusal to participate in the aforementioned acts. Central to his claim was the submission that these acts were religious practices that went against his belief as a Jehovah's Witness and thus infringed his constitutional right to practice and profess his religion guaranteed by Article 15. However, the Court held that since \\"religion\\" in Singapore under the Constitution is restricted to \\"a citizen's faith in a personal God\\" and does not include \\"a system of belief in one's own country\\", the acts in question were not religious practices. Hence, the appellant's rights had not been contravened.Nappalli, p. 537, para. 26. The Court took the view that \\"the appellant's interpretation of the pledge and anthem ceremony as a religious ceremony was a distortion of secular fact into religious belief\\".Nappalli, p. 538, para. 28. If the appellant's interpretation was correct, this would result in Article 15(1) losing operative effect, for \\"[h]ow can the same Constitution guarantee religious freedom if, by asking citizens to pledge their allegiance to country, it is (as the appellant suggests) coercing participation in a religious ceremony? This excruciatingly absurd interpretation cannot have been what was envisaged by the authors of the Constitution.\\"Nappalli, p. 538, para. 29. The courts in Malaysia have taken a similar approach in defining the meaning of religious practice under Article 11 of the Malaysian Constitution. Furthermore, they have also consulted religious texts to determine what type of acts might constitute religious practices. In Halimatussaadiah v. Public Service Commission, Malaysia (1992),Halimatussaadiah v. Public Service Commission, Malaysia [1992] 1 M.L.J. 513, H.C. (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia). the appellant claimed she had been wrongfully dismissed from her employment due to her refusal to comply with employment conditions that prohibited any attire that covered a female public servant's face while on duty. According to the appellant, this contravened her right to religious practice on grounds that the wearing of the purdah was part of her religious practice as a Muslim. However, the court disagreed and held that the purdah was not considered a religious practice as it was not a requirement under Islam since there was no express mention of such a requirement in the Quran. However, in the Philippines, the courts have accorded the individual autonomy to decide what constitutes religious practice. It is up to the individual to decide what constitutes religious practice so long as such acts do not offend public interest. This was the view proffered in Ebralinag v. Superintendent of Schools of Cebu (1993),Ebralinag v. Superintendent of Schools of Cebu [1993] 219 S.C.R.A. 256, Supreme Court (Philippines), archived from the original on 27 May 2011. in which the issue was whether the petitioners, who were Jehovah's Witnesses, ought to be expelled from schools for refusing to salute the flag, sing the national anthem and recite the oath of allegiance as required by the Republic Act No. 1265 of 11 July 1955 and other legislation. Cruz J. held that the state could not interpret the Bible for the petitioners as \\"only they can read it as they see fit. Right or wrong, the meaning they derive from it cannot be revised or reversed except perhaps by their own acknowledged superiors. But certainly not the State. It has no competence in this matter.\\" Propagate Singapore courts have not yet interpreted the word propagate in Article 15(1) of the Constitution. Article 25(1) of the Indian Constitution, which is in the same terms as in Article 15(1) of the Singapore Constitution, guarantees to individuals the right to freely \\"profess, practise and propagate\\" their religions. The term propagate was considered by the Supreme Court of India in Stanislaus v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1977).Stanislaus v. State of Madhya Pradesh A.I.R. 1977 S.C. 908, Supreme Court (India). The Court adopted a dictionary definition of propagate, which was \\"to transmit or spread from person to person or from place to place\\". Accordingly, it held that the word as used in Article 25(1) confers on an individual the right to transmit or spread one's religion by an exposition of its tenets. In other words, an individual has the right to spread his or her religion by explaining to others the principles and beliefs underlying that particular religion. However, in the Court's opinion Article 25(1) does not confer the right to convert another person who holds a pre-existing religious belief to one's own religion as this would impinge on the \\"freedom of conscience\\" provided for in the Article, which accords each individual with the freedom to hold or consider a thought, fact or viewpoint independent from those of others. In short, the constitutional right to propagate one's own religion is protected insofar as an individual who exercises this right respects the freedom of persons following other religions. The Indian jurist Hormasji Maneckji Seervai has criticized Stanislaus and has said it should be overruled. He argued that when a person propagates his religion to another, that act does not violate the other person's free conscience but allows that person an opportunity to freely choose a religion:, cited in . Restrictions on the freedom of religion Under Article 15(4) of the Constitution, a person's freedom of religion can be restricted by a general law relating to public order, public health or morality. The term general law is not defined in the Constitution, but may refer to a law that applies to all persons or places belonging to a particular class. Malay Muslim girls wearing tudungs (Islamic headscarves). Due to the Government's insistence on secularism, tudungs may not be worn in Singapore's primary schools of a public character. The restrictions on freedom of religion are an important reflection of Singapore's secularism. Although the Constitution does not express the doctrine of secularism explicitly,. the report of the 1966 Constitutional Commission described Singapore as a \\"democratic secular state\\"., para. 38.. Singapore's secularism is similar to France's secularism in that both models seek to \\"protect the state from religion\\". However, unlike in Singapore, the principle of secularism in France is constitutionally expressed.See Article 2 of the Constitution of France, and Loi du 9 d√©cembre 1905 relative √† la s√©paration des √âglises et de l'√âtat (Law of 9 December 1905 in relation to the Separation of Churches and the State). In being secular, the Government of Singapore does not reject religion. Instead, it has been said to practise \\"accommodative secularism\\".. The Government's adherence to secularism has been criticized in that the unwritten principle of secularism has trumped the constitutional protection of freedom of religion.Thio, \\"The Secular Trumps the Sacred\\". For instance, in 2002 a controversy arose upon the suspension of four Muslim girls from school when their parents insisted that they wear the tudung (Islamic headscarf) to national schools. Section 61 of the Education Act. empowers the Minister for Education to regulate schools, including prohibiting students from wearing anything not forming part of an official school uniform.. The parents of the schoolgirls took the view that the Ministry of Education's school uniform policy was unconstitutional as it violated the girls' freedom of religion under Article 15(1). While the parents eventually did not pursue legal proceedings against the Ministry, the controversy showed the Singapore Government's steadfastness in insisting on secularism. and the difficulties in reconciling secularism and freedom of religion in Singapore. Meaning of public order, public health and moralityPublic order= The term public order is not defined in the Constitution but has been judicially deliberated in a series of important legal cases involving the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor (1994),. the Minister of Home Affairs had deregistered the Jehovah's Witnesses by Order No. 179/1972 made pursuant to section 24(1)(a) of the Societies Act.. This provision allows for the dissolution of registered organizations considered to be threats to public peace, welfare or good order. The Minister had also made Order No. 123/1972 and Order No. 405/1994 pursuant to section 3(1) of the Undesirable Publications Act,. prohibiting publications by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society relating to the Jehovah's Witnesses. The appellants were convicted in a district court for possession of prohibited publications. They appealed and sought to challenge the constitutionality of the Minister's prohibition order and the deregistration of the Jehovah's Witnesses, arguing that their right to freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 15(1) of the Constitution had been infringed. Old Supreme Court Building, where the Court of Appeal and High Court sat until moving to a new building in 2005. In a 1994 case, the High Court equated public order in Article 15(4) of the Constitution with \\"public peace, welfare and good order\\" in s 24(1)(a) of the Societies Act, rather than holding that public order is threatened by unlawful physical violence. Counsel for the appellants submitted that the Jehovah's Witnesses in Singapore were a small, non-violent group and that there was no evidence their activities were against public order in any manner.Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), p. 233, paras. 58‚Äì59. He relied on the Malaysian case Tan Boon Liat v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri, Malaysia (1976),Tan Boon Liat v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri, Malaysia [1976] 2 M.L.J. [Malayan Law Journal] 83, High Court (Ipoh, Malaysia). which considered the meaning of public order in the context of section 4(1) of the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance 1969 (Malaysia):Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance 1969 (No. 5 of 1969) (Malaysia). Section 4(1) empowers the Malaysian Minister of Home Affairs to order that a person be detained without trial if he is satisfied that it is necessary to do so with a view to preventing the person from acting in a manner prejudicial to public order, or for the suppression of violence or the prevention of crimes involving violence. Chief Justice Yong Pung How rejected this conception of public order. He noted that Singapore had a policy of compulsory military service known as National Service, and that the Minister had taken the view that the continued existence of the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, which held the belief that military service was forbidden, was contrary to public peace, welfare and good order. As such, since the Minister had formed the view that the Jehovah's Witnesses were a threat to national security, it was not open to the court to take a different view on the matter. Yong C.J. said in his judgment: \\"I could not see how the concept of public order as envisaged under Art 15(4) is dissimilar to the notion of public peace, welfare and good order within s 24(1)(a) of the Societies Act.\\"Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), p. 237, para. 68. He emphasized that the right to religious freedom was not an absolute right as it was subject to the inherent limitations set out in Article 15(4). The right of freedom of religion had to be reconciled with the \\"right of the state to employ the sovereign power to ensure peace, security and orderly living, without which the constitutional guarantee of civil liberty would be a mockery\\".Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), p. 235, paras. 63‚Äì64, citing Commissioner, H.R.E. v. L.T. Swamiar A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 282, S.C., India. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed. In 1995, the Minister for Information and the Arts made Order No. 405/1995 banning materials published by the International Bible Students Association, an organization associated with the Jehovah's Witnesses. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts (1995),Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts [1995] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 627, H.C. (Singapore). the plaintiffs sought leave to apply for an order of certiorari to quash the order, alleging that it was ultra vires as it contravened, among other things, Article 15(1) of the Constitution. Presiding over the case in the High Court, Justice Judith Prakash referred to Yong C.J.'s holding in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994) concerning the meaning of public order.Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. MITA (1995), p. 639, para. 28. In a 1995 commentary on Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), Professor Thio Li-ann noted that in other jurisdictions a lack of public order includes the notion of \\"endangerment to human life and safety as well as the disruption of public tranquillity\\", and argued that \\"[t]o establish that public order is threatened, it appears that some degree of violence or unlawful physical violence must be shown\\".Thio, \\"The Secular Trumps the Sacred\\", pp. 72‚Äì73. Using this as a point of reference, she criticized Yong C.J.'s equation of public order with \\"public peace, welfare or good order\\".Thio, \\"The Secular Trumps the Sacred\\", p. 76. =Public health and morality= The Singapore courts have not yet interpreted the meaning of the terms public health and morality in Article 15(4). The UK case of R. (Ghai) v. Newcastle City Council (2009). is therefore interesting for purposes of comparison. The claimant, an orthodox Hindu, applied to his local authority for land to be dedicated for traditional open air funeral pyres. The local authority refused the request, relying on subsidiary legislation that made it an offence to burn human remains other than in a crematorium. The claimant then applied for judicial review, submitting that the decision infringed his right to manifest his religion or belief which was protected by Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The High Court found that the statutory interference with the claimant's right was justified as it was necessary for the protection of public morals and of the rights and freedoms of others.Ghai, pp. 644‚Äì645, paras. 120‚Äì122. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment on grounds unrelated to Article 9, holding that open air pyres were permissible on a proper construction of the legislation.. Test for determining if restriction of right is appropriateSingapore= In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), counsel for the appellants argued that there had to be a \\"clear and immediate danger\\" to public order before the right of freedom of religion could be restricted, and in this case the restriction was unjustified since there had been no such threat at all.Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), pp. 233‚Äì234, para. 59. However, Yong C.J. said that attempt to apply the \\"clear and immediate danger\\" test was misplaced: However, Yong C.J. did not articulate any alternative test for determining if a restriction upon freedom of religion is appropriate. Quoting Malaysian Chief Justice Hashim Yeop Sani's judgment in the case Minister for Home Affairs, Malaysia v. Jamaluddin bin Othman (1989),Minister for Home Affairs, Malaysia v. Jamaluddin bin Othman [1989] 1 M.L.J. 418 he agreed that \\"[t]he freedom to profess and practise one's religion should not be turned into a licence to commit unlawful acts or acts tending to prejudice or threaten the security of the country\\".Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), p. 235, para. 63, citing Jamaluddin bin Othman at p. 419. Yong C.J. considered that since \\"the sovereignty, integrity and unity of Singapore are undoubtedly the paramount mandate of the Constitution\\", religious beliefs and practices which tended to run counter to these objectives had to be restrained.Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), p. 235, para. 64. In the appeal against Prakash J.'s judgment to the Court of Appeal, also called Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts (1996),Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts [1996] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 294, Court of Appeal (Singapore). counsel for the appellants argued that the restriction placed by the Minister on the importation, sale and distribution of the Jehovah's Witnesses publications was too wide and disproportionate. Applying an approach similar to that taken in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), the Court of Appeal noted that the appellants were essentially seeking to challenge the view taken by the Minister that Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to carry out National Service was a threat to national security. The Court regarded this as a non-justiciable issue and declined to allow the appellants to bring an application for judicial review of Order No. 405/1995.Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. MITA (1996), pp. 305‚Äì306, para. 36. The Court only discussed proportionality in the context of the administrative law doctrine of Wednesbury unreasonableness and not with respect to Art. 15(1): p. 306. para. 38. Professor Thio Li-ann has argued that since Article 15(1) is the general statement of principle that guarantees freedom of religion while Article 15(4) is an exception to the general principle, Yong C.J.'s assertion that \\"actions undertaken or flowing from [religious] beliefs must conform with the general law relating to public order and social protection\\" is incorrect.Thio, \\"The Secular Trumps the Sacred\\", p. 78. In making a case against judicial deference and for judicial balancing of interests, she says: In Thio's view, courts should adopt a three-step proportionality approach when interpreting constitutional fundamental liberties. A judge should first \\"identify the interests behind two competing rights eg the value of religious liberty as a source of private and public virtue as well as being an aspect of free conscience as against the value of having public order and a stable environment. Secondly, these factors are all to be placed on the Libra-like balancing scales of justice so that their merits and demerits can be assessed against each other. ... Thirdly, all things considered, the Judge is to deliver his judgment as to where the balance should lie.\\"Thio, \\"The Secular Trumps the Sacred\\", pp. 82‚Äì83. In the light of this approach, Yong C.J.'s acceptance of the Minister's view \\"as conclusive, refusing to question it on the basis of not wanting to transgress the legal/merits dichotomy\\" resulted in a failure to balance the interest of the appellants against that of the State.Thio, \\"The Secular Trumps the Sacred\\", p. 84. =Other jurisdictions= The situation in Singapore may be contrasted with the application of a proportionality analysis in other jurisdictions vis-√†-vis the constitutional protection of freedom of religion. Section 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that the freedom of conscience and religion is a fundamental freedom enjoyed by everybody. It is subject to section 1: \\"The rights and freedoms set out in the Canadian Charter are subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\\" In the important decision R. v. Oakes (1986),. the Supreme Court of Canada held that a two-part test must be satisfied before a limitation infringing a right can be \\"saved\\" by section 1. First, the limitation must have \\"an objective related to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society\\"; and, second, it must be shown \\"that the means chosen are reasonable and demonstrably justified\\". The second part is described as a \\"proportionality test\\" which requires the invoking party to show: In Multani v. Marguerite- Bourgeoys (Commission scolaire) (2006),. the issue was whether a ban in a public school on Sikh students carrying kirpans (ceremonial daggers) for religious purposes was justifiable. Justice Louise Charron, who delivered the Court's majority opinion, applied the Oakes test to section 2(a) of the Charter.Marguerite-Bourgeoys, para. 43. She held that the school could not discharge its burden of proving that prohibiting the kirpan was a reasonable limit on the student's constitutional freedom of religion. The UK Human Rights Act 19981998, c. 42. makes Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects freedom of religion, enforceable in UK domestic law. Article 9(2) states when the freedom of religion may be restricted: \\"Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\\" R. (Begum) v. Headteacher and Governors of Denbigh High School (2006). See also , a case involving a Rastafari who claimed that a substantial amount of cannabis that he was found in possession of was used by him for religious purposes. The Court of Appeal said that when considering under Article 9(2) whether limitations to freedom of religion are necessary, the necessity is shown by the existence of pressing social need and a reasonable relationship between the terms employed and the aims pursued. was a House of Lords case involving a female Muslim student who wished to wear a jilbab (a long, coat-like garment) to comply with her understanding of the requirements of her faith, but was disallowed from doing so. Lord Bingham of Cornhill said that under Article 9(2), for a restriction to be justified it must be \\"prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society for a permissible purpose, that is, it must be directed to a legitimate purpose and must be proportionate in scope and effect\\".Begum, p. 114, para. 26. In the end, a majority of the Law Lords hearing the appeal (including Lord Bingham) held that the appellant's rights had not been interfered with. However, the court held unanimously that even if they had been, there were justifiable grounds for such interference, one of which was the need to protect the rights of other female students at the school who would not wish to be pressured into adopting a more extreme form of Muslim dress. The Constitutional Court of South Africa. In a 2002 case, a majority of the Court applied a proportionality analysis to hold that although a complete ban on use and possession of cannabis infringed the right to freedom of religion of a Rastafari who wished to use the drug for sacramental purposes, the infringement was justifiable as it was proportionate to the State's \\"war on drugs\\" policy. In Prince v. President of the Law Society of the Cape of Good Hope (2002),. the appellant challenged, among other things, the constitutionality of the South African Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act 1992Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act 1992 (No. 140 of 1992) (South Africa). before the Constitutional Court of South Africa. He claimed that his religion ‚Äì the Rastafari movement ‚Äì required him to use cannabis and argued that the Act, which prohibited the possession of this drug, infringed his right to freedom of religion protected by section 15 of Chapter 2 of the Constitution of South Africa. Similar to section 1 of the Canadian Charter, section 36(1) of the South African Constitution provides: Justice Sandile Ngcobo, writing for the minority,Made up of Justices Sandile Ngcobo, Yvonne Mokgoro and Albie Sachs, and Acting Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga. said that \\"[t]he limitation analysis ... involves the weighing up of competing values and ultimately an assessment based on proportionality\\",Prince, para. 45. and that in weighing competing interests and evaluating proportionality it was \\"necessary to examine the relation between the complete ban on the sacramental use or possession of cannabis by the Rastafari and the purpose of the limitation as well as the existence of the less restrictive means to achieve this purpose\\".Prince, para. 77. Ultimately, though, a majority of the CourtChief Justice Arthur Chaskalson and Justices Lourens Ackermann, Johann Kriegler, Richard Goldstone and Zak Yacoob. held that although the appellant's freedom of religion had been infringed, the infringement was justifiable in that the restriction was proportionate to the \\"war on drugs\\" policy of the State ‚Äì a general exemption for religious purposes would be virtually impossible to police and would interfere materially with the government's ability to enforce its drug control legislation, and other proposed control schemes would be administratively unworkable.Prince, paras. 128‚Äì143. A key distinction between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution is that in the latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society. One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4). Burden of proof An applicant has the burden of proving that a legislative restriction on the freedom of speech has nothing to do with public order, public health or morality. There must be some substance in the applicant's complaint ‚Äì the Government does not have an immediate duty to justify making a decision that restricts the applicant's right to freedom of speech simply because the applicant complains of an alleged infringement of Article 15(1).Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. MITA (1995), p. 639, para. 27. Instances of restrictionsRight of propagation= Propagation of religion is not protected when it amounts to an act contrary to any general law relating to public order, public health, or morality under Article 15(4) of the Constitution. In Public Prosecutor v. Koh Song Huat Benjamin (2005),Public Prosecutor v. Koh Song Huat Benjamin [2005] SGDC 272, District Court (Singapore). a District Court held that the right to propagate an opinion is not an unfettered right:Koh Song Huat Benjamin, para. 8. In Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong (2009),Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong [2009] SGDC 163, D.C. (Singapore). the District Court said that the above statement, which referred to opinions on race, applied with equal force to insensitive and denigrating opinions about religious beliefs.Ong Kian Cheong, para. 81. The case involved two accused persons who were convicted under the Sedition Act. and the Undesirable Publications Act. for distributing religious literature that was considered seditious and objectionable to Muslims. Section 3(1)(e) of the Sedition Act defines a seditious tendency as including a tendency to \\"promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore\\". In the course of spreading their own faith, the accused persons had offended public order by distributing religious materials that were objectionable to Muslims, and the Court regarded this to be beyond the bounds of the constitutional right to propagate religion. The Court was of the view that although a person is free to choose his or her own religion and to practise it,Ong Kian Cheong, para. 79. religious fervour to spread faith must be constrained by considerations of sensitivity, tolerance and mutual respect for the faith and religious beliefs of another. Individuals cannot claim to be ignorant of the sensitivity of race and religion in Singapore's multi-racial and multi-religious society.Ong Kian Cheong, para. 82. Larissis v. Greece (1999). points to other grounds on which the right to propagate one's religion might reasonably be restricted in Singapore. In that case, the European Court of Human Rights accepted that the right to try to persuade another of one's own religious beliefs is included in the \\"right to manifest [one's] religion or belief\\" provided for by Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, this right is not void of limitations. Article 9(2) of the Convention prescribes limitations to the freedom to manifest one's religion \\"in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\\". The Court clarified that Article 9(1) does not protect improper proselytism, such as when one offers material or social advantages to entice another to adopt certain religious beliefs, or when one applies improper pressure with a view to gaining new members for a religious group.Larissis, para. 45. On the facts of the case, the Court found that Article 9 had not been infringed by the prosecution of three air force officers for proselytizing to their subordinates, since the hierarchical nature of military life meant it was difficult for a subordinate to rebuff the approaches of persons of superior rank. Thus, a conversation which might be regarded as a harmless exchange of ideas in a civilian context could be seen in a military setting as harassment or the imposition of undue pressure in abuse of power.Larissis, para. 51. Other constitutional provisions In addition to Article 15, there are other provisions in the Constitution that protect religious freedom. Article 12(2) prohibits discrimination against Singapore citizens on the ground of, among others,The other grounds are race, descent and place of birth: Constitution, Art. 12(2). religion in any law; in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority; or in the administration of any law relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of property, or the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.However, Art. 12 does not invalidate or prohibit any provision regulating personal law; or any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion, or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion, to persons professing that religion: Art. 12(3). Related to this is Article 16, subsection (1) of which prohibits discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of, among others, religion in the administration of public educational institutions (and, in particular, as regards the admission of students or the payment of fees), and in providing financial aid from public funds for the maintenance or education of students in any educational institution. The Constitution declares that religious groups have the right to establish and maintain institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions, but provides that people cannot be discriminated against on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws.Constitution, Art. 16(2). Furthermore, no person may be compelled to receive instruction in or take part in any ceremony or act of worship of a religion apart from his or her own.Constitution, Art. 16(3). For the purposes of this provision, the religion of a person under 18 years of age is decided by his or her parent or guardian: Art. 16(4). The Government has a constitutional responsibility \\"constantly to care for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore\\".Constitution, Art. 152(1). In particular, the Government must exercise its functions in such a way as to recognize the special position of the Malays, the indigenous people of Singapore. Accordingly, it has the responsibility to \\"protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language.\\"Constitution, Art. 152(2). The Constitution also requires the Legislature to enact legislation to regulate Muslim religious affairs and to establish a council to advise the President concerning matters relating to Islam.Constitution, Art. 153. The legislation in question is the Administration of Muslim Law Act..

There are three forms of bias, namely, actual, imputed and apparent bias. If actual bias on the part of an adjudicator can be proved, the High Court can quash the decision. Cases of actual bias are rare due to the difficulty of proving the existence of a prejudiced judicial mindset. Imputed bias arises when a decision-maker has a pecuniary (monetary) or proprietary (property related) interest in the decision he or she is charged to adjudicate. The courts have also extended the category of imputed bias to situations where adjudicators have personal, non- pecuniary interests in decisions. The existence of a situation leading to an imputation of bias warrants the decision-maker being automatically disqualified. Even if actual or imputed bias cannot be proved, an appearance of bias is sufficient for a judgment or decision to be set aside. The legal test for establishing apparent bias in Singapore has been the subject of some controversy. In the cases of Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew (1992) and Tang Liang Hong v. Lee Kuan Yew (1997), the Court of Appeal stated that the test should be \\"reasonable suspicion\\", that is, the court should ask itself whether \\"a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts [would] have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the applicant was not possible\\". However, after a number of cases which established that a \\"real likelihood\\" test should be applied in the UK, the High Court in Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2005) expressed the obiter view that there was in fact no material difference between the two tests. In Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), a different High Court judge disagreed with this view, holding that the reasonable suspicion test is less stringent as it requires a lower standard of proof than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities. He expressed preference for the reasonable suspicion test over the real likelihood test. As of January 2013, the Court of Appeal had not yet ruled on the matter. Doctrine of bias Bias is one of the grounds of judicial review in Singapore. It is an aspect of the principle nemo iudex in causa sua ‚Äì no one should be a judge in his or her own cause ‚Äì which is regarded as one of the twin pillars of natural justice.The other pillar being audi alteram partem, literally \\"hear the other party\\". As Lord Hodson put it in Ridge v. Baldwin (1963),. one of the features of natural justice is \\"the right to be heard by an unbiased tribunal\\".Ridge v. Baldwin, p. 132. Prior to Ridge v. Baldwin, UK law drew a distinction between situations where decision-makers were under a legal duty to act judicially or quasi-judicially, and situations where they were regarded as acting in a purely administrative manner. Decision-makers were only required to comply with the requirements of natural justice in the former situation.. The position in Singapore was the same. In an old Straits Settlements case originating from Singapore, Alkaff and Co. v. The Governor in Council (1937),Alkaff and Co. v. The Governor in Council [1937] M.L.J. [Malayan Law Journal] 211, [1937] M.L.J. Rep. 202, [1937] S.S.L.R. [Straits Settlements Law Reports] 201, Court of Appeal (Straits Settlements). the Straits Settlements Court of Appeal noted that in order for the law relating to bias to apply to the Commissioner of Lands, it was \\"first necessary for the Court to be satisfied that he was acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity\\".Alkaff [1937] M.L.J. at p. 213, [1937] M.L.J. Rep. at p. 204. However, in Ridge v. Baldwin the House of Lords found this distinction to be false. Thus, the legal position today is that all public authorities, whether judges or administrative officers, must comply with the rules of natural justice. What public authorities must do to avoid bias was expressed in the High Court of Singapore decision Re Singh Kalpanath (1992)Re Singh Kalpanath [1992] 1 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 595, High Court (Singapore). by Justice Chan Sek Keong as follows: \\"A judge is expected to maintain the highest standard of conduct in the exercise of his functions. He must bring an open and impartial mind to the determination of the dispute before him and must not act in any way which compromises the integrity of the judicial process.\\"Kalpanath, p. 628, para. 86. In Kalpanath, it was stated that there are three kinds of bias: actual, imputed and apparent bias.Kalpanath, p. 625, para. 76. Actual bias If actual bias on the part of a judge or tribunal can be proved by a party to a legal proceeding, or on the part of a public authority by a person aggrieved by its decision, the High Court can quash the judgment or decision. A decision-maker will be deemed actually biased if it is shown that he or she was influenced by partiality in reaching the decision or was actually prejudiced in reaching the decision.. In Chee Siok Chin v. Attorney-General (2006),. allegations of actual bias were made based on the actions of the judge, Justice Belinda Ang. Her failure to prevent the opposing counsel from interrupting the appellant was supposedly reflective of a biased state of mind.Chee Siok Chin, p. 546, para. 6. Justice Ang adopted the view in Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. (1999). that cases of actual bias are rare due to the difficulty of proving the existence of a prejudiced judicial mindset. Rather, the inclination of the law \\"is to protect litigants who can discharge the lesser burden of showing a real danger of bias without requiring them to show that such bias actually exists\\".Locabail, p. 472. The allegations of actual bias in Chee Sok Chin were deemed to be \\"entirely frivolous and ludicrous\\", in that \\"a fair-minded and reasonable observer would hardly on those flimsy grounds\\" conclude that Justice Ang \\"would not be able to make an objective and impartial decision of the matters\\" before her as another impartial judge would.Chee Siok Chin, p. 548, para. 10. Citing Tang Liang Hong v. Lee Kuan Yew (1997),. an apparent bias case, the judge said that claims of actual bias need to be based on facts which are \\"substantially true and accurate\\".Tang Liang Hong, p. 597, para. 51, cited in Chee Siok Chin, p. 548, para. 12. Chiam See Tong in May 2006. In a 1993 case arising from Chiam's challenge against his expulsion from the Singapore Democratic Party, the Court of Appeal held that the Party's disciplinary subcommittee had acted in a biased manner. In Hennedige Oliver v. Singapore Dental Council (2007),. the High Court held that members of the Disciplinary Committee (\\"DC\\") of the Council had not acted in a biased manner towards Hennedige even though they had interjected a number of times during Hennedige's testimony, and had treated the person who had lodged a complaint against Hennedige gently but had cross-examined Hennedige robustly and strongly challenged his evidence. This was because the members of the DC were entitled to seek clarifications from Hennedige. Furthermore, his evidence covered much wider ground than the complainant's, and part of Hennedige's oral evidence at the inquiry did not feature in his written explanation. The nature of the Hennedige's answers at the inquiry warranted the additional questions, and he must have expected his peers in the DC to question him thoroughly on his many assertions.Hennedige, p. 563, para. 24. There have been a number of cases in which allegations of actual bias have been made out. In Wong Kok Chin v. Singapore Society of Accountants (1989),Wong Kok Chin v. Singapore Society of Accountants [1989] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 633, H.C. (Singapore). the High Court held that people hearing disciplinary proceedings have to approach the issue with an open mind without prejudgment.Wong Kok Chin, p. 657, para. 54. In this instance, the members of the Society's Disciplinary Committee had gone beyond their authority to carry out a due inquiry and had caused the inquiry to become an inquisition aimed at securing evidence to justify a finding of guilt.Wong Kok Chin, p. 658, para. 55. Likewise in Singapore Amateur Athletic Association v. Haron bin Mundir (1993),Singapore Amateur Athletic Association v. Haron bin Mundir [1993] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 407, C.A. (Singapore). the Court of Appeal stated that the slanted questions and preconceived views of the Association's disciplinary subcommittee had breached natural justice. The hearing had been \\"more like an inquisition to vindicate the corporate views of the appellants\\" than a dispassionate attempt at finding the truth.Haron bin Mundir, p. 427, paras. 68, 71 and 73. In Chiam See Tong v. Singapore Democratic Party (1993),Chiam See Tong v. Singapore Democratic Party [1993] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 774, H.C. (Singapore). Chiam challenged his expulsion from the political party following a hearing before the disciplinary committee of the Party's Central Executive Committee (\\"CEC\\"). The High Court found that the members of the disciplinary committee had been biased, as was reflected in the confrontational and hostile tone taken by certain CEC members. In addition, some of them had acted as judges in their own cause as they had been the object of remarks made by Chiam, which had prompted the disciplinary proceedings.Chiam See Tong, pp. 787‚Äì788, paras. 49‚Äì52.. Imputed bias=Arising from a pecuniary or proprietary interest Lord Chief Justice Hewart, who, in R. v. Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy (1923), stated that \\"justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done\\". Bias may be imputed to a decision-maker when he or she has a pecuniary (monetary) or proprietary (property related) interest in the decision he or she is charged to adjudicate. This form of bias warrants the decision-maker being automatically disqualified from exercising its powers. The rule is vigorously enforced to protect the maxim enunciated by Lord Chief Justice Hewart in R. v. Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy (1923)R. v. Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy [1924] 1 K.B. 256, High Court (Divisional Court) (England and Wales). that \\"justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done\\".Ex parte McCarthy, p. 259, cited in , and . A pecuniary or proprietary interest can arise in two ways. First, the decision-maker may have an interest of this nature in one of the parties involved in a matter. Secondly, the decision-maker may have a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the outcome of the decision placed before him or her. The two situations are not mutually exclusive ‚Äì in a 1999 decision, the Court of Appeal of Victoria held that it is not a judge's mere shareholding in a party \\"but rather it is the potential interest, created by that shareholding, in the subject matter or outcome of the litigation which is the disqualifying factor\\".. A seminal case in this respect is Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852).Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852) 3 H.L. Cas 759, H.L. (UK). In that case the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, was found to have an interest as a shareholder in a company which was a party to a suit presented to him. As this fact was discovered after his Lordship had heard the suit, he was disqualified on the ground of his interest and the decree he issued was held to be voidable. The House of Lords said that it is \\"a settled principle of constitutional law that a man cannot be judge in his own cause\\".Dimes, p. 773. In Alkaff, the Straits Settlements Court of Appeal recognized that a financial interest may affect a person with bias.Alkaff [1937] M.L.J. at pp. 219‚Äì220, [1937] M.L.J. Rep. at p. 210. In considering whether a pecuniary or proprietary interest exists, it is irrelevant whether the decision-maker was actually biased or not when exercising his or her powers. Though it may be practically possible to exercise impartiality in such a situation, it is the appearance of justice that lies at the root of this principle of natural justice. In Dimes, certiorari was granted to quash Lord Cottenham's decree due to his pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case even though, as Lord Campbell stated, \\"[n]o one can suppose that Lord Cottenham could be, in the remotest degree, influenced by the interest that he had in this concern\\".Dimes, p. 793. Similarly, in the Alkaff case Acting Chief Justice Terrell noted that the rule against bias applied even though, quoting the trial judge, \\"[the Commissioner of Lands] was in fact completely unbiased. He conducted his inquiry in each case methodically and exhaustively and with the most fairness and impartiality\\". In answering the central question of what constitutes a pecuniary or proprietary interest, the trend over time has been towards a raising of the degree of the interest that will disqualify adjudicators. In the 19th century it was held that \\"any direct pecuniary interest, however small\\" would result in a disqualification for bias.R. v. Rand (1866) L.R. 1 Q.B. 230 at 232, H.C. (Queen's Bench) (England and Wales). By 1999, the courts had come to apply a de minimis exception to the degree of pecuniary interest required. Nonetheless, \\"any doubt should be resolved in favour of disqualification\\".Locabail, p. 473, para. 10. Arising from a non-pecuniary personal interest The courts have extended the category of imputed bias to situations where adjudicators have interests in decisions that are personal but neither pecuniary nor proprietary. A well-known example is the UK case R. v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2) (1999).. Amnesty International was a party to the case, and the House of Lords held that Lord Hoffmann, being a chairman of a subsidiary of Amnesty, ought to have been automatically disqualified from hearing the case. This was despite his Lordship having neither a pecuniary nor proprietary interest in the outcome of the case.Ex parte Pinochet, p. 143. It observed:Ex parte Pinochet, p. 135. The case of Locabail elaborated on the factors that may lead to such bias being imputed. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales noted that while it is \\"dangerous and futile to attempt to define or list the factors which may or may not give rise to a real danger of bias\\", such a danger may be found if, among other things, a judge is found to be:Locabail, p. 480, para. 25. A Singapore Improvement Trust building in Tiong Bahru Estate. In a 1937 case the Straits Settlements Court of Appeal held there was a possibility of bias when the Commissioner of Lands was appointed by the Governor-in-Council to look into the merits of certain proposals made by the Trust even though the Commissioner was a Trust member. In Alkaff, the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) had made three proposals for back lanes to be laid out. The Governor-in-Council appointed the Commissioner of Lands, who was an ex officio member of the SIT, to inquire into the merits of the proposals, and eventually made orders approving them. As regards the Commissioner's dual role, the members of the court agreed that, in the words of Federated Malay States Chief Justice Thomas, \\"there did exist a fear of prejudice and a possibility of being considered to be which would infringe the high criterion that not only must justice be done but also must appear to be done\\".Alkaff [1937] M.L.J. at p. 220, [1937] M.L.J. Rep. at p. 210. Imputed bias was also referred to in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011),. which involved the issue of whether the President exercises the power of clemency in his personal discretion or whether he is required to act upon the Cabinet's advice. The appellant argued that Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong, who was a member of the Court of Appeal hearing the matter, ought to be automatically disqualified. According to the appellant, this was because the Chief Justice had previously been the Attorney-General, and as such, must have advised the President on the scope of his discretion. The implication of the appellant's submission was that the Chief Justice would have to decide the case against the appellant to cover up any negligence in his advice to the President.Yong Vui Kong, p. 1257, para. 146. The Court endorsed the principle of judicial disqualification in the case of a personal interest, stating that \\"where a judge is personally interested in the outcome of the case before him, he will not be able to give an impartial and objective judgment on the case. If he were to be allowed to adjudicate on the case notwithstanding this risk, that would, without more, undermine public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice.\\"Yong Vui Kong, p. 1257, para. 147. It went on to reject the applicant's argument based on the principle laid down by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in Locabail that a judge \\"would be as wrong to yield to a tenuous or frivolous objection as he would to ignore an objection of substance\\".Locabail, p. 479, para. 21, cited in Yong Vui Kong, p. 1258, para. 149. In the Court's view, the disqualification application was frivolous and appeared to be motivated to diminish the judicial process such that a fresh hearing had to be convened. In addition, the central premise of the application ‚Äì that the President could have acted in his own discretion in exercising the clemency power ‚Äì was implausible.Yong Vui Kong, p. 1258, paras. 149‚Äì150. Where Singapore judicial officers are concerned, there is a statutory rule that such an officer cannot \\"investigate, try or commit for trial any proceedings to which he is a party or in which he is personally interested\\"., s. 64; , s. 76. Apparent bias Opposition politician Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam in November 2005. In a 1992 appeal arising from a suit brought against him by the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew for slander at a political rally during the 1988 general election, the Court of Appeal held that a \\"reasonable suspicion\\" test applied when determining if there was apparent bias by a judge. Regardless of whether judges or administrators are actually biased, the law requires them to recuse themselves from cases where there may be a perception that they are biased. This is based on the premise that \\"justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done\\". As the High Court in Chee Siok Chin noted, the UK courts do not require actual bias to be shown in order to remove a judge from the hearing of that case. Rather, its stance \\"is to protect litigants who can discharge the lesser burden of showing a real danger of bias without requiring them to show that such bias actually exists.\\"Chee Siok Chin p. 547, para. 9. In Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew (1992),Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew [1992] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 791, C.A. (Singapore). the Court of Appeal stated that when determining whether apparent bias exists, a \\"reasonable suspicion\\" test should be applied,Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin, pp. 825‚Äì826, paras. 80 and 83. that is, \\"would a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the applicant was not possible\\"?Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin, p. 825, para. 80, citing R. v. Liverpool City Justices, ex parte Topping [1983] 1 W.L.R. 119 at 123, H.C. (Q.B.) (England and Wales). The reasonable suspicion test originated in Australia, where it is known as the \\"reasonable apprehension\\" test. The current position in Australia may be best summed up thus: \\"[A] judge is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide\\".. This is essentially the same position in Singapore, as Tang Liang Hong v. Lee Kuan Yew (1997),Tang Liang Hong v. Lee Kuan Yew [1997] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 576 at 597‚Äì598, para. 51, C.A. (Singapore). which applied the Australian cases Bainton v. Rajski (1992)Bainton v. Rajski [1992] 29 N.S.W.L.R. 539 at 541, Court of Appeal (New South Wales, Australia). and Re JRL, ex parte CJL (1986),. indicates. In the Kalpanath case, the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society of Singapore had determined that there was a sufficiently serious case for disciplinary action to be taken against the applicant, a lawyer. The respondent, who was the chairman of the Disciplinary Committee, had engaged in private conversations with a material witness while the applicant's hearing before the Committee was going on. The applicant claimed that this showed the respondent could reasonably be thought to have displayed bias, and as a result the whole Committee was tainted by the bias.Re Singh Kalpanath, pp. 599‚Äì600, para. 4. The proceedings were eventually quashed upon a finding of apparent bias. UK developments In the UK case R. v. Gough (1993),. the House of Lords articulated a \\"real danger of bias\\" test. According to Lord Goff of Chieveley, when formulating the appropriate test for apparent bias, it was \\"unnecessary ... to require that the court should look at the matter through the eyes of the reasonable man, because the court in cases such as these personifies the reasonable man\\". He took the view that the test should be stated in terms of \\"real danger rather than real likelihood to ensure that the court is thinking in terms of possibility rather than probability of bias\\".Gough, p. 670. In Locabail, the Court of Appeal observed that Gough had not received universal approval in some jurisdictions.Locabail, p. 476, para. 17: see, for example, ; ; and Doherty v. McGlennan 1997 S.L.T. 444 (Scotland). The Court was presented with another opportunity to review the matter in Re Medicaments and Related Classes of Goods (No. 2) (2000).. It concluded that, in view of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on the right to a fair trial protected by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, a \\"modest adjustment\\" to the Gough test was required. A court should first determine what are all the circumstances relevant to the allegation that the judge was biased, then ask whether a \\"fair-minded and informed observer\\" would regard those circumstances to lead to \\"a real possibility, or a real danger, the two being the same\\", that the judge was biased.Medicaments, pp. 726‚Äì727, para. 85. Finally, in Porter v. Magill (2001),. the House of Lords reconsidered its earlier decision in Gough in the light of Locabail and Re Medicaments. It approved the two-stage test established in Locabail as modified by Re Medicaments, holding that there is apparent bias when \\"the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased\\". It omitted from the test the reference to \\"real danger\\" as it was not mentioned in European Court of Human Rights cases and \\"no longer serve[d] a useful purpose here\\".Porter, p. 494, para. 103. Subsequent cases have focused attention on the fact that the view of the informed observer has sometimes become dangerously close to becoming the court's view.; . In dealing with this, the court must adopt the public's view of the facts, not its own view. This distinction is not one of semantics, but bears great significance as it signifies the acceptance of public perception in the judicial process. Singapore developments acupuncturist that there had been apparent bias by three members of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board which had suspended him from practice led to a 2005 case in which the High Court expressed the view that there is no real difference between the \\"reasonable suspicion\\" and \\"real likelihood\\" tests. =Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2005)= Following the legal developments in the UK, the test for apparent bias in Singapore was extensively reconsidered by the High Court in the 2005 case Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board.. On the facts of the case, it was unnecessary for Judicial Commissioner Andrew Phang to have decided definitively whether the correct test was the reasonable suspicion or the real likelihood test.Tang Kin Hwa, p. 612, para. 20. Nonetheless, he expressed the obiter view that the \\"reasonable suspicion of bias\\" test established in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and Tang Liang Hong was not significantly different from the English \\"real likelihood of bias\\" test (also known as \\"real possibility of bias\\" test). According to him, \\"[t]he common substance of both tests appears, in a nutshell, to be this: The key question is whether or not there was a perception on the part of a reasonable person that there would be a real likelihood of bias\\".Tang Kin Hwa, pp. 617‚Äì618, para. 39. The concept of \\"likelihood\\" entails \\"possibility\\" and not \\"probability\\". Phang opined that this is simply another way of stating that there is a \\"reasonable suspicion\\" on the part of the person concerned, meaning that although the concept of \\"reasonable suspicion\\" is supposed to be of a less stringent standard, this standard is reflected in the concept of \\"possibility\\" and thus there is essentially no substantial difference in the two tests. In addition, the word real in the term real likelihood of bias cannot mean \\"actual\\", as the test after all pertains to apparent bias and not actual bias. Judicial Commissioner Phang also thought that \\"one ought not to draw a sharp distinction between the court's perspective ... and that of the public\\" as both are \\"integral parts of a holistic process\\". The practical reality in every case is that the court has to take into consideration the perspective of the public, and hence personifies the reasonable man.Tang Kin Hwa, pp. 618‚Äì619, para. 40. He cautioned that in deciding a case, a court has to focus on the substance and not be unduly distracted by the form of the terminology utilized.Tang Kin Hwa, p. 619, para. 43. In applying either test, justice can be done and seen to be done if the court, personifying the reasonable man, takes a broad commonsense approach without inappropriately relying on special knowledge, the minutiae of court procedure or other matters outside the ken of the ordinary, reasonably well informed member of the public.Tang Kin Hwa, pp. 618‚Äì619, para. 40, citing Locabail, p. 480, para. 25. =Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006)= The following year, a different judge of the High Court departed from the view taken in Tang Kin Hwa. In Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006),. Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon definitively answering the question left open by Phang as to whether the two tests for apparent bias were the same. He thought that there was a real difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests.Shankar Alan, p. 101, para. 56. In his opinion, \\"suspicion\\" suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. \\"Reasonable\\" suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, \\"likelihood\\" points towards something being likely, and \\"real\\" suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue is the degree to which a particular event is not likely or possible.Shankar Alan, p. 99, paras. 49‚Äì50. Menon disagreed with both Lord Goff in Gough and Judicial Commissioner Phang in Tang Kin Hwa in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was \\"a very significant point of departure\\"Shankar Alan, p. 103, para. 62. The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities, this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice.Shankar Alan, pp. 107‚Äì108, paras. 74‚Äì75. Ultimately, Judicial Commissioner Menon reiterated that the test applicable in Singapore is the reasonable suspicion test, as the Court of Appeal had stated in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and Tang Liang Hong. He also expressed preference for this test for the following reasons, among others:Shankar Alan, p. 110, para. 81, citing Webb, pp. 70‚Äì72. *If the court adopts the real likelihood test, it will in reality be requiring the complainant to show that the judge was actually biased, though with a lower standard of proof based on a sufficient degree of possibility. *There is a risk that if the real likelihood test is applied, the court appears to be determining that it is possible or likely that the judge was biased. Therefore, the test may lead to dissatisfaction in the administration of justice on the part of members of the public, which is exactly what the doctrine of apparent bias was intended to avoid. *Conscious of the negative consequences of the real likelihood test on the judge in question and the administration of justice referred to in the previous paragraph, the court may lose sight of the rationale behind the apparent bias doctrine ‚Äì that justice is not merely done but that the public must see without doubt that it is done. Furthermore, Menon argued that the real likelihood test requires there be a sufficient degree of bias, but this is \\"utterly imprecise\\" and \\"inherently, indeed impossibly, subjective\\". In contrast, the reasonable suspicion test avoids this problem as it directs the court's mind not towards the degree of possibility of bias but towards the suspicions the court thinks a fair-minded member of the public could reasonably entertain on the facts.Shankar Alan, p. 111, para. 84. Shankar Alan is not the final say on the matter. As Judicial Commissioner Phang put it in Tang Kin Hwa, \\"a definitive view ought to be expressed by the Singapore Court of Appeal itself. Principles of natural justice are so fundamental that any interpretation or elaboration of them must have no less than the imprimatur of the highest court of the land.\\"Tang Kin Hwa p. 620, para. 45. As of January 2013, the opportunity for the Court of Appeal to rule on the matter had not arisen. =Academic views= The view has been taken by scholars that there is no practical difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In a 2008 paper,. Lionel Leo and Chen Siyuan concede that there is a slight difference in the meaning of the terms real likelihood and reasonable suspicion, but are of the view that this difference is hardly material. The gap between the two tests is considerably narrow and, in practice, the two tests are unlikely to yield different results in most cases.Leo & Chen, p. 449. It was stated in Cook International Inc. v. B.V. Handelmaatschappij Jean Delvaux (1985)Cook International Inc. v. B.V. Handelmaatschappij Jean Delvaux [1985] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 225 at 231, H.C. (England and Wales). that the contrast between the tests was between reasonable suspicion of bias on the one hand, and the appearance of a real likelihood of bias on the other. Hence what must be established is the appearance of a real possibility of bias and this is not very different from establishing that a fair-minded member of the public could have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant was not possible.Leo & Chen, p. 452. The reasonable suspicion test has the intention of protecting public confidence, but Leo and Chen wonder how accurately this test actually reflects the public's view. The test as formulated in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin requires that the reasonable man be sitting in court and in the know of all the relevant facts. However, this is usually not the case. Most of the public only receives information in bits and pieces, and thus even if a case passes the reasonable suspicion test, the public may not be satisfied that there was no possibility of bias. Thus the concept that the reasonable suspicion test reflects the public's perspective is overstated.Leo & Chen, p. 451. The practical reality is that when the reasonable man is imbued with all the relevant facts, he will essentially be in the same position as the court. Therefore, the suggested approach is that the court, in personifying the reasonable man, should take into account all relevant circumstances and determine if there is the suspicion or possibility of the appearance of bias whilst being mindful to exclude considerations stemming from the individual judge's personal preferences, special knowledge and legal sophistication.Leo & Chen, p. 454. Dame Sian Elias, the Chief Justice of New Zealand, observed at a lecture to the Singapore Academy of Law in 2004 that while the appearance of impartiality matters, it is necessary to acknowledge that good judges cannot be \\"ideological virgins\\",. The text of the lecture is also available as . and that it is disadvantageous to require them to be cloistered from society.Elias, p. 13, para. 37. She noted that the public has to rely on judges \\"bring[ing] an open mind to judging\\", as it is their professional responsibility.Elias, p. 15, para. 45. Exceptions to the doctrine of bias=Necessity The doctrine of necessity is an exception to the rule against bias and operates to prevent a failure of justice.. According to Anwar Siraj v. Tang I Fang (1982),Anwar Siraj v. Tang I Fang [1981‚Äì1982] S.L.R.(R.) 391, H.C. (Singapore). necessity is the greatest single common law exception to the general rule that an adjudicator who appears to be biased or prejudiced must disqualify himself from participating in a proceeding. This rule is firmly established and is to the effect that disqualification of an adjudicator will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power to act. The rule applies regardless of whether the disqualification arguably arises from the combination of prosecutorial and judicial functions, pecuniary interest, personal hostility or bias.. However, there are limitations to the rule of necessity. One suggested limitation is that the rule is inapplicable if the disqualification of a member will still leave a quorum of an administrative agency capable of acting. Another is that the rule of necessity will not justify an adjudicator sitting where actual bias can be shown.Flick, pp. 140‚Äì141. Waiver Upon disclosure that the judge may be biased, the parties to the suit may choose to request that the judge recuse himself and have the proceedings started before another judge. If the parties choose to proceed on with the claim without any objections to the judge, it stands to reason that a court will infer a waiver to the accusation of bias if either party had not raised an objection to bias at the commencement of a suit or at any time during it, following the approach taken by Locabail which was applied by the Federal Court of Malaysia in M. G. G. Pillai v. Tan Sri Dato' Vincent Tan Chee Yioun (2002).M. G. G. Pillai v. Tan Sri Dato' Vincent Tan Chee Yioun [2002] 2 M.L.J. 673, Federal Court (Malaysia). In Locabail, Mrs. Emmanuel and her lawyers did nothing after the judge's disclosure of a conflict of interest and only sprung into action to complain about bias after learning she had failed in her claims. It was held that the law did not allow Mrs. Emmanuel to have the best of both worlds by waiting to see how her claims in litigation turned out before pursuing her complaint of bias.Locabail, p. 24, para. 69. Similarly, in Pillai, although the applicant had knowledge of all matters grounding his complaint of bias before judgment was delivered, he only decided to complain after he had lost the appeal. The court found that if he had not lost, it was quite certain that he would not have filed the motion. The doctrine of waiver therefore militated firmly against him.Pillai, p. 692.

Category:Bias Category:Conflict of interest Category:Singaporean administrative law ","title":"Doctrine of bias in Singapore law"},{"id":"25902563","text":"public-sector trade union UNISON on strike for better pay at The Forum in Norwich, UK, in July 2008. In both the UK and Singapore, where a public authority has made a clear representation to individuals regarding a certain policy position it has taken, such as their remuneration, these persons have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before the policy is changed, and possibly also a legitimate expectation that the original policy should apply to them. The doctrine of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when there has been a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The doctrine of legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law. The procedural dimension of the doctrine of legitimate expectation has been recognized by Singapore courts and, since 2013, the substantive form of the doctrine as well. However, whether the courts will adopt the UK approach with regard to measuring legitimate expectation with the ruler of proportionality remains an open question. Development of the doctrine in the English courts=Legitimate expectation of a procedural right A model of Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, UK, popularly known as \\"The Doughnut\\". A 1983 case decided by the House of Lords involving GCHQ employees established the principle that a clear representation by a public authority that it will hold a consultation before making a decision can give rise to a legitimate expectation that such a consultation, and that a decision can be quashed if the expectation is not fulfilled. The doctrine of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of fairness. English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers.. Generally, the courts will grant judicial review of an administrative decision based on an individual's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The individual has to show that the representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry. The key idea is that under certain circumstances where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). (\\"GCHQ case\\"). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can come in the form of a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds. Legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit The Royal Courts of Justice in London, where the Court of Appeal of England and Wales sits. In a 1999 case, the Court controversially held that individuals can have a legitimate expectation to receive a substantive benefit, not merely a procedural right. The English courts initially wavered in recognizing that an individual has a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit arising from a representation from the authorities. The notion of protecting a substantive legitimate expectation was espoused in the 1995 High Court decision in R. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, ex parte Hamble (Off-shore) Fisheries Ltd.R. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, ex parte Hamble (Off-shore) Fisheries Ltd. [1995] 2 All E.R. 714, High Court (Queen's Bench) (England & Wales). In that controversial case, Justice Stephen Sedley formulated the framework for legitimate expectations as the balance of the requirements of fairness against the decision-maker's reasons to change the policy.Hamble, p. 724 per Sedley J.: \\"[L]egitimacy is a relative concept, to be gauged proportionately to the legal and policy implications of the expectation\\". This was in step with the development of the doctrine of proportionality as prescribed in the Treaty on European Union,Treaty on European Union (7 February 1992), [1992] 1 C.M.L.R. [Common Market Law Reports] 573, Art. 5(3). and in European Court of Justice case law.See, e.g., . The decision wove proportionality back into the fabric of judicial review in the UK under the banner of an expanding doctrine of \\"fair administration\\" despite the clear rejection of proportionality as a self-standing ground of review by the House of Lords in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind (1991). In 1996, the Court of Appeal opined in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Hargreaves that \\"[o]n matters of substance (as contrasted with procedure) Wednesbury provides the correct test\\". In Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation (1947), the High Court had introduced the idea of Wednesbury unreasonableness, that is, a public authority's decision is unlawful if, although they have \\"kept within the four corners of the matters they ought to consider, they have nevertheless come to a conclusion so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it\\".Wednesbury, p. 234. The inference to be made from ex parte Hargreaves was that where an applicant claimed to have a substantive expectation, it was not for the court to judge if that expectation should be protected vis-√†-vis the broader public interest. The court should only intervene if the decision-maker's exercise of its discretion satisfied the Wednesbury threshold. However, the courts' role in protecting substantive legitimate expectations was clearly established by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan (1999). The case involved an applicant who was promised by her local authority that a new nursing home would be her \\"home for life\\". The Court granted the application for review on the ground that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to have the substantive benefit of staying in the nursing home as promised by the local authority. It also set out the approach to be taken in safeguarding procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. Where procedural legitimate expectations were concerned, courts would require an opportunity for consultation to be given unless there was an overriding reason to resile from it (such as the national security concern that arose in the GCHQ case). As regards substantive legitimate expectations, courts would decide whether cases lie \\"... in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field\\",. or are those \\"where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract\\".Coughlan, p. 242, para. 59. In the first situation, the public authority \\"is only required to bear in mind its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight it thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course\\", and the court may only review the authority's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness.Coughlan, pp. 241‚Äì242, para. 57. On the other hand, when assessing a case in the second situation, the court decides whether for an authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power. The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy. A slightly different approach has been adopted by Lord Justice of Appeal John Laws. In R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie (1999), he suggested that the Coughlan categories are not \\"hermetically sealed\\",Ex parte Begbie, p. 1130.Leyland & Anthony, pp. 322‚Äì323. and in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2005),. he expanded on this by taking a proportionality approach:Nadarajah, para. 68. In Coughlan the view was expressed that the court will assess whether it is unfair for an authority to frustrate a legitimate expectation when the expectation is \\"confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract\\". In R. (Bancoult) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2) (2007), it was accepted that members of a group of close to a thousand or even up to several thousand people. could have a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit following the government's announcement of its intentions.Bancoult (No. 2), pp. 407‚Äì408, paras. 73‚Äì76. Where a person convinces the court that his or her substantive legitimate expectation has been frustrated, the usual remedy is for the court to order that the public authority fulfil the expectation. However, in R. (Bibi) v. Newham London Borough Council (2001). it was held that when the decision in question is \\"informed by social and political value judgments as to priorities of expenditure\\" it is more appropriate for the authority to make the decision,Bibi, p. 252, para. 64. and the court may order that the authority should merely reconsider its decision, taking into account the person's substantive legitimate expectation.Bibi, p. 252, para. 67. See Leyland & Anthony, pp. 324‚Äì325. Coughlan has been criticized for allowing the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.Leyland & Anthony, pp. 323‚Äì325. Singapore=Legitimate expectation of a procedural right A night view of the Supreme Court of Singapore from the lane between the Old Supreme Court Building and City Hall. The existence of the legitimate expectation doctrine has been accepted by the Singapore courts. Singaporean courts have accepted the existence of both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. In Re Siah Mooi Guat (1988),Re Siah Mooi Guat [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 165, High Court (Singapore). the applicant was a Malaysian national who was declared a prohibited immigrant under section 8(3)(k) of the Immigration Act. and had her re-entry permit to Singapore and employment pass cancelled. As the applicant's appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs was rejected, the applicant took out an application to the High Court to quash the decision of the Minister. One ground of the application was that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to two procedural rights: the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered her case under the Immigration Act, and the duty of the Minister to give reasons for his decision.Siah Mooi Guat, p. 172, para. 16. In his judgment, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray considered Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1968),. decided by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. He found that the procedural principles that govern the administration of Singapore's immigration laws were similar to those in the UK. In Schmidt it was decided that an alien has no right to enter the country except by leave and the Home Secretary can refuse leave without giving any reason; that if an alien is given leave to enter the country for a limited period he has no right to stay, and no legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay, for a day longer than the permitted period; and that an alien's application for an extension of his stay can be refused without reasons and without a hearing as the rules of natural justice do not apply.Cited in Siah Mooi Guat, p. 178, para. 31. Furthermore, in Schmidt Lord Denning had espoused the obiter view that where an alien's permit to stay \\"is revoked before the time limit expires, he ought ... to be given the opportunity of making representations: for he would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for a permitted time\\".Schmidt, p. 171. This argument was advanced by Siah's counsel to persuade the court that \\"an alien who is in possession of an entry permit which has not yet expired is in the country lawfully until the date of expiry and, therefore, he has an interest during the unexpired portion that carries with it a public law right to a fair procedure, if and when the minister desires to terminate that leave to stay prematurely\\". The High Court judge considered this proposition and conceded that it was an \\"attractive\\" one. However, he ultimately dismissed the argument by saying that it had \\"not been supported by any English authority\\",Siah Mooi Guat, p. 178, paras. 32‚Äì33. and that the position in Singapore is \\"quite different\\". He stated that Parliament had already provided in the Immigration Act for appeals and the right to be heard has been given statutory recognition and protection in the Act,Immigration Act, s. 8(6). and the applicant had already availed herself of the right to appeal. The Minister was not required to give reasons for his rejection of the appeal under the common law or the Immigration Act.Siah Mooi Guat, pp. 178‚Äì179, para. 34. Legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit The existence of the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation in Singapore public law was accepted by the Court of Appeal in the case of Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor.Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor [1997] SGCA 38, [1997] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 842, Court of Appeal (Singapore), archived from the original on 24 December 2011. In his judgment written on behalf of the Court, Chief Justice Yong Pung How stated that the idea behind the doctrine is that certain \\"expectations could, in suitable circumstances, be deserving of protection, even though they did not acquire the force of a legal right\\".Abdul Nasir, p. 858, para. 55. Nonetheless, the Court stated: \\"[W]e were not concerned with judicial review, nor were we deciding whether any claim of a legitimate expectation could estop the Prisons Department in future from applying the interpretation which we gave to life imprisonment. That was a separate matter which was not under consideration here.\\"Abdul Nasir, p. 858, para. 54. The URA Centre, photographed in January 2006. A 2009 decision of the High Court involving the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) confirmed that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation applies in Singapore. Other decided cases also do not indicate whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation will be developed in the way it has been developed in the UK. In Siah Mooi Guat, another argument the applicant raised was that she had a legitimate expectation to continue to reside in Singapore until the expiry of her re-entry permit.Siah Mooi Guat, p. 172, para. 15. Sinnathuray J. distinguished Attorney-General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu (1983),. a Privy Council case on appeal from Hong Kong, from the case at hand. In the Privy Council case there had been an express promise made to Ng by the Government of Hong Kong which had created a substantive legitimate expectation. In the present case, no promise had been made to be applicant that her stay in Singapore was to be conditioned by any considerations other than those provided in the Immigration Act and related regulations. No substantive legitimate expectation arose in the applicant's favour, following the dictum of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton in the GCHQ case that legitimate expectation arises \\"either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue\\".GCHQ case, p. 401. Thus, the judge did not discuss the detailed legal rules to be applied to determine when an aggrieved person may be said to have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009),. the applicant and her husband owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi- detached houses. The URA rejected the applicant's redevelopment application on the basis of the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation.Borissik, p. 105, para. 46. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007). to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply.Borissik, p. 105, para. 49. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made.Borissik, p. 106, para. 52. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore. In UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. Jurong Town Corp. (2011),UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. Jurong Town Corp. [2011] 3 S.L.R. 94, H.C. (Singapore). the High Court \\"entertain[ed] some doubt\\" as to whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is part of Singapore law, but did not discuss the matter further as neither the respondent nor the Attorney-General had made submissions on the issue.UDL Marine, p. 115, para. 66. Subsequently, however, in Chiu Teng @ Kallang Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Land Authority (2013)Chiu Teng @ Kallang Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Land Authority (2013) [2014] 1 S.L.R. 1047, H.C. (Singapore). For commentary, see ; ; and . a differently constituted High Court held that substantive legitimate expectation should be recognized as a ground of judicial review if the following conditions are satisfied:Chiu Teng, pp. 1089‚Äì1090, para. 119. Assessment Academics have expressed scepticism as to whether the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights.. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with the manner in which the decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy.. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers.. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function. On the other hand, in Coughlan the Court of Appeal cited the following passage from R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte MFK Underwriting Agents Ltd. (1990):R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte MFK Underwriting Agents Ltd. [1990] 1 W.L.R. 1545, Divisional Court (England & Wales). The Court of Appeal emphasized that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness.Coughlan, p. 247, para. 73. Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, as it is for public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.Coughlan, p. 251, para. 82.

Minister for Home Affairs is a seminal case in administrative law decided by the Court of Appeal of Singapore in 1988. The Court decided the appeal in the appellants' favour on a technical ground, but considered obiter dicta the reviewability of government power in preventive detention cases under the Internal Security Act (\\"ISA\\"). The case approved the application by the court of an objective test in the review of government discretion under the ISA, stating that all power has legal limits and the rule of law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. This was a landmark shift from the position in the 1971 High Court decision Lee Mau Seng v. Minister of Home Affairs, which had been an authority for the application of a subjective test until it was overruled by Chng Suan Tze. Chng Suan Tze was followed by amendments by Parliament to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989 which purported to return the applicable law regarding judicial review of government discretion under the ISA to that in Lee Mau Seng. The legality of these changes was challenged in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990). In that decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that the subjective test of judicial review now applied to internal security matters. Facts and legal issues Between May and June 1987, the appellants Chng Suan Tze, Kevin Desmond de Souza, Teo Soh Lung and Wong Souk Yee were arrested by the Internal Security Department (ISD) during Operation Spectrum for alleged involvement in a Marxist conspiracy to subvert and destabilize the country. Detention orders were made against the appellants under section 8(1)(a) of the Internal Security Act (\\"ISA\\"). by the Minister for Home Affairs and Law, S. Jayakumar, directing that they be detained for one year. The provision empowers the Minister to make an order directing that a person be detained if the President is satisfied that detention is necessary to prevent the person from endangering, among other things, the security or public order of Singapore. Subsequently, the detention orders were suspended under section 10 of the ISA.ISA, s. 10, allows the Minister to suspend detention orders made under s. 8(1)(a) and to revoke any suspension direction if satisfied that the person failed to comply with any conditions imposed, or if it is necessary in the public interest. However, following the release of a press statement by the appellants in which they denied the Government's accusation that they were Marxist conspirators, the suspension directions were revoked and they were re-arrested. The revocation order stated that \\"in view of the statement, it is necessary in the public interest that the direction ... be revoked.\\"Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs [1988] SGCA 16, [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 525 at 535, para. 15, C.A. (Singapore), archived from the original on 24 December 2011. The Ministry of Home Affairs later stated that investigations had established that the press statement was a political ploy to discredit the Government and that the appellants had sworn statutory declarations reaffirming the truth of their original statements to the ISD.Chng Suan Tze, p. 536, para. 21. The appellants' one-year detentions were subsequently extended under section 8(2) of the ISA.Chng Suan Tze, p. 536, para. 23. The ISA, s. 8(2), provides that the President may direct that the period of any order made under s. 8(1) may be extended for a further period or periods not exceeding two years at a time. In May and June 1988, the appellants unsuccessfully applied to the High Court for leave to apply for writs of habeas corpus.See De Souza Kevin Desmond v. Minister for Home Affairs [1988] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 464, H.C.; and Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 30, H.C. The appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal. The lead counsels were Geoffrey Robertson Q.C. for Chng, de Souza and Wong; Anthony Lester Q.C. for Teo; and Sivakant Tiwari for the respondents. The following issues were raised in the appeals:Chng Suan Tze, pp. 536‚Äì537, paras. 25‚Äì28. *Whether the Minister for Home Affairs' discretionary power under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA to issue a detention order, suspend the order and revoke the suspension is reviewable by a court of law. *Whether the re-detention of the appellants was lawful under section 10 of the ISA. *Whether Teo's detention, even if originally lawful, had been rendered unlawful by the conditions of her detention. Ratio decidendi The ratio decidendi, or legal point in the case which determined the judgment, was a narrow one. The appeals were allowed on the ground that the Minister had not discharged the burden of proving the validity of the detention orders. Under section 8(1) of the ISA, the President's satisfaction that a person poses a national security risk is a condition precedent to the Minister's power to make a detention order. The Minister attempted to demonstrate that the President had been so satisfied before the detention order was made by pointing to the fact that the recitals in the detention orders stated that the President \\"is satisfied\\", and by filing an affidavit by the Permanent Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs which asserted that the \\"government\\" was satisfied that the appellants were a danger to national security. However, the Court of Appeal found that this was inadmissible evidence as it amounted to hearsay. Furthermore, as regards the affidavit, the satisfaction of the Government was not the same as the President's satisfaction.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 537‚Äì542, paras. 29‚Äì42. Obiter dicta The Chng Suan Tze decision is more notable for the issues that the Court of Appeal discussed obiter dicta, having already allowed the appeals on the ground that the respondents had not discharged their burden of proving the President's satisfaction. Reviewability of the exercise of discretion The Court held that the exercises of discretion by the President and the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA are reviewable by the courts because the subjective test that had been adopted in the 1969 Malaysian case Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister of Home Affairs), Malaysia,Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister of Home Affairs), Malaysia [1969] 2 M.L.J. [Malayan Law Journal] 129, Federal Court (Malaysia). which had been adopted locally in 1971 in Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs,Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs [1971] SGHC 10, [1971‚Äì1973] S.L.R.(R.) 135, H.C. (Singapore), archived from the original on 5 January 2012. could no longer be supported and should be replaced by an objective test. Furthermore, although a court would not question the executive's decision as to what national security required, the court could examine whether the executive's decision was indeed based on national security considerations. =Application of the objective test= Under the subjective test applied in Karam Singh and Lee Mau Seng, the exercise of discretion by the President and the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA is not open to review. The court cannot enquire about the grounds and the facts justifying the executive's decision. In contrast, under the objective test, the exercise of discretion is reviewable by a court of law and the executive has to satisfy the court that there are objective facts justifying the executive's decision. The Royal Courts of Justice in London, where the House of Lords used to sit until its judicial functions were taken over by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in 2009. In Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal declined to apply the House of Lords cases Liversidge v. Anderson and Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs. The Court of Appeal rejected the application of the subjective test in favour of the objective test on the following grounds. Firstly, the Court held that Karam Singh and other cases following it were no longer good law in so far as they applied Liversidge v. Anderson (1941). and Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941),Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs [1942] A.C. 284, H.L. (United Kingdom). which were World War II cases from the United Kingdom. The House of Lords and the Privy Council had since recognized that the majority judgments in Liversidge and Greene had been wrong, and preferred Lord Atkin's dissenting judgment in Liversidge which advocated the objective approach.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 545‚Äì549, paras. 56‚Äì69. Secondly, the Court concurred with judicial opinion expressed in other Commonwealth jurisdictions that courts can objectively review the executive's exercise of discretion in the context of preventive detention on national security grounds. Cases from Zimbabwe,Minister of Home Affairs v. Austin (1987) L.R.C. (Const.) 567, Supreme Court (Zimbabwe), which held that even though subjective language had been used in s. 17(1) of the Emergency Powers (Maintenance of Law and Order) Regulations 1983 (Zimbabwe), the minister had to consider objective facts and the court could determine whether he had acted reasonably in doing so. South-West Africa,Katofa v. Administrator-General for South Africa 1985 (4) S.A. 211. and St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla, in which the Privy Council was of the view that subjective words in a statute could not be construed to give absolute discretion. were referred to with approval.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 549‚Äì551, paras. 70‚Äì78. Thirdly, applying the subjective test in reviewing the exercise of discretion under the ISA would mean giving the executive arbitrary powers of detention, rendering such powers unconstitutional and void. The ISA was enacted pursuant to Article 149(1) of the Constitution (now the ). which, at the time Chng Suan Tze was decided, stated that any provision of a law designed to stop or prevent a number of specified actions threatening national security was valid notwithstanding that it was inconsistent with three of the fundamental liberties protected by the Constitution, or would, apart from Article 149(1) itself, be outside the legislative power of Parliament. However, the Article did not protect the validity of sections 8 and 10 of the ISA against any inconsistency with Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the law. In Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980),. the Privy Council held that the word law in Article 12, among other provisions, refers to a system of law which incorporates fundamental rules of natural justice that had formed part and parcel of the common law of England that was in operation in Singapore at the commencement of the Constitution. The Court of Appeal expressed the view that although sections 8 and 10 of the ISA were not arbitrary because they permitted detentions only for specific purposes which bore a reasonable relation to the object of the law, if a court could not review the exercise of the discretion, \\"that discretion would be in actual fact as arbitrary as if the provisions themselves do not restrict the discretion to any purpose and to suggest otherwise would in our view be naive\\".Chng Suan Tze, p. 552, para. 82. Therefore, if a subjective test was applied, that would allow for arbitrary detention which would result in inconsistency with Article 12(1).Chng Suan Tze, pp. 551‚Äì552, paras. 79‚Äì82. Fourthly, support for the applicability of the objective test was found in Teh Cheng Poh v. Public Prosecutor (1978), a Privy Council decision on appeal from Malaysia, in which it was held that \\"as with all discretions conferred upon the executive by Act of Parliament, [the Malaysian ISA] does not exclude the jurisdiction of the courts to inquire whether the purported exercise of the discretion was nevertheless ultra vires either because it was done in bad faith ... or because as a result of misconstruing the provision of the Act\\".. See Chng Suan Tze, pp. 552‚Äì553, paras. 83‚Äì85. Finally, the Court was also of the opinion that \\"the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law\\" because \\"all power has legal limits\\", and therefore the exercise of discretionary power warrants court examination.Chng Suan Tze, p. 553, para. 86. Furthermore, the ISA did not contain any ouster clause applicable to section 8 or 10. The Court also refuted the argument that accountability to Parliament was an alternative safeguard against the executive abusing its powers under the ISA,Chng Suan Tze, p. 554, para. 86. citing Inland Revenue Commissioners v. National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981):. =National security considerations= The Court of Appeal held further that as the discretion conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, the issue of whether detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion. However, the Court referred to two United Kingdom decisions.. which stood for the principle that courts are not precluded from determining whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Therefore, the court could still determine whether the matters relied on by the executive in the exercise of discretion were indeed within the scope of section 8.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 555‚Äì557, paras. 87‚Äì94. Scope of judicial review Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, UK, popularly known as \\"The Doughnut\\". A 1984 case decided by the House of Lords involving GCHQ employees established the principle that exercises of executive power can be reviewed by the courts on the grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. The Court of Appeal held that the scope of review of the discretion conferred by sections 8 and 10 of the ISA is limited to the traditional administrative law grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety as established in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984), also known as the GCHQ case. The Court noted that the scope of judicial review depends on whether a jurisdictional or precedent fact is involved. Where no jurisdictional fact is involved, the scope of review is limited to the GCHQ grounds. Where a jurisdictional fact issue arises, the scope of review extends to deciding whether the precedent fact has been established. Whether a particular discretionary power is subject to any jurisdictional fact depends on the construction of the legislation which creates that power..Chng Suan Tze, pp. 558‚Äì562 and 563, paras. 108‚Äì114 and 119. The appellants argued that the discretion conferred on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs by sections 8 and 10 of the ISA could only be exercised if the fact ‚Äì which was jurisdictional in nature ‚Äì that the appellants were likely to act or to continue acting in a manner prejudicial to Singapore's security could be objectively established. However, the Court concluded that the discretion conferred by the ISA on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs by those provisions, properly construed, did not involve a jurisdictional fact. Section 8(1) had expressly entrusted to the President the decision as to whether or not a detainee was likely to act or to continue acting in a manner prejudicial to national security, and section 10 had entrusted to the Minister the decision whether on available evidence a revocation order was necessary in the public interest. In any case, it could not have been Parliament's intent to leave the issue of whether a detainee was likely to act or continue acting in a manner prejudicial to Singapore's security to be objectively determined as a fact by a court of law. The Court said: \\"It hardly needs any emphasis that the judicial process is unsuitable for reaching decisions on national security.\\"Chng Suan Tze, pp. 562‚Äì563, paras. 115‚Äì118. The Court also rejected the proposition that the principle of proportionality be recognized as a separate ground for judicial review. Rather, it should be subsumed under irrationality, in the sense that if an executive decision is disproportionate it can be said to be irrational in that no reasonable authority could have come to such a decision.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 564, para. 121. Burden of proof According to the Court of Appeal, the burden of proof of justifying the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, in the first instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of proof could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the detention was necessary for national security purposes, and by the production of the detention order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 564‚Äì565, paras. 122‚Äì127. Other issuesPower of re-detention= Counsel for Chng, de Souza and Wong argued that although section 10 of the ISA conferred power on the Minister of Home Affairs to revoke a direction suspending a detention order, it did not empower him to subsequently re-arrest and re-detain his clients. Since section 10 should be strictly construed in favour of the detainees' liberty, the court could not imply a power of arrest and detention into section 10 when Parliament had not provided for it. The Court of Appeal took the view that once a suspension direction under section 10 is revoked, the original detention order becomes operative again. The power to arrest and detain is conferred by the detention order itself.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 566‚Äì567, paras 128-133. =Conditions of detention= Teo's counsel submitted that the nature and conditions of her detention rendered the detention unlawful. The Court of Appeal accepted that detention that was prima facie lawful can become unlawful if the nature or conditions of the detention fall below some minimum standard of treatment, but that extremely inhuman conditions must be shown to exist.Middleweek v. Chief Constable of Merseyside [1992] (1985) 1 A.C. 179, Court of Appeal (England and Wales), as explained in Re Al-Afifi's Application for Habeas Corpus (unreported, 28 August 1987) per Justice Richard Rougier. In general, where the manner in which the detention is conducted is alleged to be unlawful, the detainee's remedy is to challenge the validity of the conditions of the detention, not the lawfulness of the detention itself.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 567‚Äì568, paras. 134‚Äì138. Aftermath Parliament House in June 2006. Amendments to the Constitution and the ISA were passed by Parliament in 1989 to reverse the effect of the Court of Appeal's judgment in Chng Suan Tze. Following the Court of Appeal's decision in December 1988, the Singapore Government introduced bills into Parliament to amend the Constitution and the ISA to reverse the effect of the Chng Suan Tze judgment. The bills were enacted on 25 January 1989, with the constitutional amendments taking effect on 27 January, and the ISA amendments taking effect from 30 January 1989.; . See ; . The constitution amendment bill inserted a new Article 149(3) into the Constitution which provided that any question as to the validity of any exercise of executive discretion with respect to any law referred in Article 149 (which included ISA) was to be \\"determined in accordance with the provisions of any law as may be enacted by Parliament for this purpose\\", a reference to the 1989 amendments to the ISA. In addition, nothing in Article 93 ‚Äì which provides that \\"judicial power of Singapore\\" is \\"vested in a Supreme Court and in such subordinate courts as may be provided by any written law for the time being in force\\" ‚Äì invalidated such provisions. Article 149(1) itself was also amended to state that inconsistency with various fundamental liberties guaranteed by the Constitution did not affect the validity of a law designed to stop or prevent action threatening national security, or \\"any amendment to that law or any provision in any law enacted under the provision of clause (3) [that is, Article 149(3)]\\". The list of fundamental liberties referred to in Article 149(1) was extended to include Article 11, which prohibits retrospective criminal laws and repeated criminal trials, and Article 12, which protects equality before the law and equal protection of the law. Judicial review of preventive detention pursuant to the ISA was curtailed by the insertion of sections 8A to 8D. Section 8A defined judicial review in the Act to mean applications for the prerogative orders of mandamus, prohibition and certiorari; applications for a declaration or an injunction; writs of habeas corpus; and \\"any other suit or action relating to or arising out of any decision made or act done in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the Minister by any provision of this Act\\". The section was presumably intended to cover all possible court applications that might be brought against executive directions and orders made under the ISA. Section 8B(1) returned the law governing judicial review to that \\"applicable and declared in Singapore on the 13th day of July 1971\\", the day Lee Mau Seng was decided. In addition, the provision stated that no decision on or after the date from any other Commonwealth country would apply in Singapore. This was intended to overturn the dicta in Chng Suan Tze that an objective test was to be preferred, and to restrict the courts to applying the subjective test. Section 8B(2) further entrenched this by limiting judicial review only to questions of \\"compliance with any procedural requirement of [the ISA]\\". Further, section 8C abolished all appeals to the Privy Council relating to \\"any decision made or act done under\\" the ISA in respect of \\"any question of interpretation of the provisions of Part XII of the Constitution or any law made thereunder\\", which included Article 149. This prevented any appeals to the Privy Council that questioned the constitutionality of the amendments to the Constitution and the ISA. Section 8C was repealed after all appeals to the Privy Council from Singapore were abolished in 1994.By the Judicial Committee (Repeal) Act 1994 (No. 2 of 1994), which came into force on 8 April 1994. Finally, section 8D provided for the retrospective application of the amendments to the ISA to any proceedings for judicial review of any decision made or act done under the Act made before the 1989 amendments. The legality of the amendments to the Constitution and ISA was unsuccessfully challenged by Teo in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989‚Äì1990)Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs [1989] 1 S.L.R.(R) 461, H.C. (Singapore); [1990] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 347, C.A. (Singapore). and by another detainee, Vincent Cheng, in Cheng Vincent v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990).Cheng Vincent v. Minister for Home Affairs [1990] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 38, H.C. (Singapore). The principle that the correct test in judicial review proceedings is an objective one continues to apply in cases not involving the Internal Security Act. In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs (1992),Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs [1992] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 352, C.A. (Singapore). the Court of Appeal remarked that, following Chng Suan Tze, the power of the Minister for Home Affairs under section 30(a) of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. to order the preventive detention of a person was dependent on the Minister's objective, and not subjective, satisfaction that the person was associated with criminal activities.Kamal Jit Singh, p. 360, para. 22. Academic opinions The Court of Appeal's decision and the amendments to the Constitution and the ISA which followed have sparked much academic discourse. The following issues have been raised by commentators. Use of foreign case law in deciding ISA cases The reliance on Privy Council and Commonwealth case law by the Court has been noted by commentators as \\"an important precedent for a universalist approach to constitutional interpretation\\".. However, Parliament disapproved of the Court's use of foreign case law as a guide in ISA cases because the \\"conditions [in those jurisdictions] are totally different from ours\\".. This was relied on as a justification for the amendments which returned the law to that enunciated in Lee Mau Seng. Professor Thio Li-ann notes that this represented \\"an attempt to 'freeze' the common law, whose very nature is to evolve incrementally\\".. Furthermore, adopting the position of the majority in Liversidge v. Anderson, meant applying a test that had been formulated in World War II Britain in modern peace-time Singapore.Thio, p. 59. During the Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, the Minister for Home Affairs and Law S. Jayakumar said that the Singapore courts had no choice but to apply United Kingdom and other Commonwealth precedents because if they ignored them, the Privy Council would probably overrule the Court of Appeal.S. Jayakumar (25 January 1989), Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, col. 467. However, it has been noted that contrary to this suggestion, the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze came to its decision after \\"a well-reasoned, careful examination of Commonwealth precedents\\".Thio, p. 58. Judiciary's role in national security One of the Parliament's justifications for restricting judicial review in response to Chng Suan Tze was that national security is \\"not a judicial decision\\" and is not capable of \\"objective evaluation by the courts\\".S. Jayakumar (25 January 1989), Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, col. 527. Commentators have noted, though, that the role of the court as enunciated in Chng Suan Tze is merely to be convinced that there is a national security issue at hand, not to inquire into the executive action required to preserve it.. In fact, the court applied the doctrine of justiciability which recognizes that the limits of judicial review in politically sensitive issues is better left to the discretion of the executive. It has also been argued that by introducing an ouster clause into the ISA, an externally imposed restraint on the judiciary, Parliament has exhibited distrust towards the judiciary's ability to exercise self-restraint in dealing with ISA cases.; see also Thio, p. 60. Rule of law The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze has been lauded for its \\"desire to cultivate a robust conception of the rule of law that promoted government accountability\\".. The judgment has also been praised for its \\"high valuation of human rights as against the government\\".. In purporting to reverse the Court's decision, the 1989 amendments have been criticized for being contrary to the rule of law. Thus, it has been commented that by amending Article 149 to include a \\"notwithstanding\\" clause, the Government had in fact exempted anti-subversion laws enacted under Part XII of the Constitution from the operation of various constitutional provisions. Furthermore, by deeming that such laws were not outside legislative power, Parliament and not the Constitution is supreme where the making of such \\"special powers\\" laws is concerned. Also, this gives the executive \\"a draconian power without any substantial checks\\". In response to the potential for abuse of the wide powers conferred upon the executive, the Minister for Home Affairs and Law argued that the judiciary could not be an effective check as a bad government could abuse all discretionary powers and \\"pack the courts\\", rendering a judicial remedy \\"highly illusory\\". In his opinion, the best safeguard against abuse was for citizens \\"to ensure that the Government elected is composed of men of integrity, honesty and incorruptibility\\".S. Jayakumar (25 January 1989), Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, col. 524. However, this differed from the position he had taken 22 years earlier when he had recognized the possibility of an authoritarian, arbitrary government coming to power, and the need for a written constitution which would protect citizens against its oppressive measures. The subsequent affirmation of the constitutionality of the amendments in Teo Soh Lung has also been criticized as a commitment to \\"an anaemic version of the Rule of Law\\".Thio, p. 62. Alternative views Alternative views have been expressed that the amendments were not seeking to replace the common law of judicial review. Instead, they borrowed from the common law by turning the clock back,Tham, p. 83. and merely clarified the limits of judicial power in relation to the ISA.Yeong, p. 103. It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.Tham, p. 79; .

Prominent examples of such armour are lorica segmentata of Ancient RomeSir William Smith, A Concise dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, Publisher Murray, 1898, Original from Indiana University, Digitized Mar 17, 2009, pp.82-83 and certain versions of samurai armour. Less known examples were present in Asia from Iran to Mongolia, including Central Asia. Laminar armor from animal skins has also been traditionally made and worn in the Arctic areas of what are now Siberia, Alaska and Canada. In the 16th century laminar and lamellar armour was superseded by plated mail in the Middle East and Central Asia, remaining mainly in Mongolia. However, laminar armor did appear briefly in some form in Europe during the 16th to the 17th century with the main feature that distinguished it from other forms of laminar armor being the metal strips being fastened using sliding rivets. This was known as anima and was invented in Italy. Notable examples include the Earl of Pembroke's Armour and the armor worn by the Polish hussars. The technique was also used create segmented armor to protect the neck, upper limbs, and hips as seen in the Almain rivet, the zischagge, falling buffe, and faulds.  Ancient laminar armour  Medieval laminar armour = Japanese laminar armour  Laminar cuirasses were manufactured in Japan as early as the 4th century.Sacred texts and buried treasures: issues in the historical archaeology of ancient Japan, William Wayne Farris, University of Hawaii Press, 1998 P.75Tank≈ç (laminar), worn by foot soldiers and keik≈ç (lamellar), worn by horsemen were both pre-samurai types of early Japanese cuirass constructed from iron plates connected by leather thongs. Kiritsuke iyozane d≈ç (laminar cuirass), constructed with horizontal rows (bands) of armor plates laced together in a manner that simulates the scales (kozane) of lamellar armor. Okegawa d≈ç constructed with horizontal rows (bands) of iron plates riveted together with no lacing being used at all, this type of armour was the beginning of plate armour development in Japanese armour. At the beginning of the Sengoku period Japanese armour typically had two versions ‚Äì expensive and inexpensive. The difference was that expensive versions were made from hundreds or even thousands of individual leather and or iron scales laced together into armor strips (lamellar), this was a very time-consuming process.Samurai, warfare and the state in early medieval Japan, Karl F. Friday, Psychology Press, 2004 P.94 The two most common types of scales which made up the Japanese lamellar armors were hon kozane which were constructed from narrow or small scales, and hon iyozane which were constructed from wider scales. Laminar armor proved to be inexpensive and easier to construct, although was often made to look like simulated lamellar plates. This is known as Kiritsuke iyozane. Kiritsuke iyozane is a form of laminar armor constructed from long strips of leather and or iron which were perforated, laced, and notched and made to replicate the look of real lamellar plates. These strips of simulated lamellar plates were much more rigid than real lamellar and they were assembled into armor items in the same way that the rows of lamellar armour were. After about a century of the ceaseless civil war during the Sengoku period simulated lamellar plates and true lamellar plates become less popular as plate armor started to be used more frequently. The laminar cuirass evolved to become the okegawa d≈ç, constructed of horizontal strips of armour joined not by laces, but by rivets or staples (imitating laces).  Middle East and Central Asian laminar armour  Middle East and Central Asian laminar armour According to Bobrov, until the end of the 15th century the most popular armour in certain regions including Central Asia and Iran was lamellar armour, brigandines, and laminar armour. However, in Iran since the 15th century lamellar and laminar armour were typical only in the south, while during the 15th century the typical armour in the north was plated mail. Initially for centuries laminar armour was just a less expensive version of lamellar armor. Laminar was just made from horizontal strips of armour laced like strips of lamellar plates, but without extra-lacing and notches imitating strips of lamellar armour. And like in lamellar armour these laces could be occasionally cut during battle; the laces also frayed when an armour was worn for long periods without being mended. Later at the beginning of the 15th century construction of laminar armour had significantly changed; instead of lacing being used, strips of new laminar armour were riveted to broad straps (like in lorica segmentata). As a result, laminar armour became more reliable than lamellar armour: hidden straps couldn't be cut without the armour being penetrated, the brad straps did not require continuous mending, and the straps were stiffer and more durable than the thinner lacing that was used previously. Laminar armour eventually became more popular than lamellar armour, and almost fully replaced lamellar armour by the end of 15th century. Pure lamellar armour became very rare; however, different combinations of laminar and lamellar armour were very popular. This happened because even though laminar armour was much more reliable than lamellar, laminar armour was not flexible enough, while lamellar armours were very flexible. Laminar cuirasses could be worn with lamellar pauldrons and tassets (worn with separate bracers, greaves and helm). Less common was the opposite combination of lamellar cuirass worn with laminar pauldrons and tassets. Both could be optionally worn with lamellar or laminar cod-piece and loin-guard, or even with mirror plate reinforcement. At the end of 15th century, when laminar armour became much more popular than lamellar ones, both armour types began to be replaced by plated mails. Initially plated mail was made only as cuisses, but soon by the beginning of 16th century plated mail was utilized in both pauldrons and cuisses, as they could better envelop body and fully replaced laminar and lamellar pauldron and tassets. So a typical laminar armour of that period was just a laminar cuirass which could be worn over brigandine with sleeves supplemented by plated mail cuisses. (Helm, bracers and greaves are not mentioned here as they were conventional for that region). Sleeves of brigandine worked as pauldron, and if a brigandine was long enough its laps could work as tassets. Another option was wearing a laminar cuirass without any brigandine, but with plated mail pauldrons and cuisses. Both variations of laminar armour could be re-enforced by mirror plate (even though laminar armour would have been enough protection from steel weapons, a metal mirror was worn as protection from the \\"evil eye\\"). Finally by the end of the 16th century laminar and lamellar armour practically disappeared in the Middle East and Central Asia regions.  Mongolian laminar armour = Laminar armour of native peoples of Bering Strait region Laminar armour from hardened leather with pauldrons enforced by wood worn by Chukchi and Siberian Yupik people Armour of Chukchi and Siberian Yupik had very similar construction,\\"Tlingit, Eskimo and Aleut armors.\\" Kunstamera. Accessed 5 Feb 2014. According to different sources, Chukchi armour could have only one enormous pauldron extending to the waist, used as a shield, and looking rather like a wing or had both \\"wings\\". Both Chukchi and Yupik armour could have lamellar or laminar constructions unlike other regions were lamellar and laminar armour typically had different construction and were made from different materials. Similar lamellar armour with \\"wing\\" pauldrons was used by Koryak people. Classic lamellar armour was made from hard materials (initially from natural materials like bone, tusk, baleen, and even wood as arrow-heads initially were from bone or stone) and in the shape of a short cuirass or even consisted only of a breast-plate. While laminar armour was made from hardened seal leather and often knee long, or even longer. However late lamellar armour made from metal (iron or steel or even brass) and could be as long as laminar armour. Both lamellar and laminar armour usually were worn with a high collar (protecting neck and head) integral with one or two laminar pauldrons (used rather as shield than ordinary pauldron). This collar and its pauldrons usually were made from leather and wood. Usually at least one part of an armour (a pauldron) was laminar, but sometimes a pauldron was comparatively \\"short\\" and instead of being laminar constructed from a few wooden planks it instead used only one big plank, and the rest of the hand was protected by splinted or lamellar vambrace. Besides optional vambraces an armour could optionally have a lamellar helm, and splinted or lamellar greaves.

She became known for three books Letters from a Living Dead Man (1914), War Letters from the Living Dead Man (1915), and Last Letters From the Living Dead Man (1919), that she said were messages from a dead man produced through automatic writing. Biography Barker was born in 1869 in Leicester, Vermont. Her parents both died while Barker was still young. She worked as a shorthand writer, a teacher and wrote for newspapers. Her father had been interested in the occult and Barker shared this interest, becoming a member of the Theosophical Society. She was also initiated into the Rosicrucian Order of Alpha et Omega. Barker lived in Europe from 1910 to 1914, first in Paris and then in London. She was in London at the outbreak of World War I. In 1912, while in Paris, she felt compelled to write a passage, although she said she did not know where the words came from. She said she was \\"strongly impelled to take up a pencil and write.\\" She signed the passage \\"X\\", which at first meant nothing to her. She was told that \\"X\\" was the nickname of a Los Angeles judge called David P. Hatch and then discovered that Hatch had died before she \\"received\\" the message. In 1914 she published a book of these messages called Letters from a Living Dead Man. She said that the passages were genuine messages from the dead man and Hatch's son also believed that the communications were from his father. She published two more volumes of Hatch's messages ‚Äî War Letters from the Living Dead Man (1915), and Last Letters From the Living Dead Man (1919). Around the time of the publication of War Letters from the Living Dead Man in 1915, Barker developed an interest in psychoanalysis. By 1919 she was studying 14 hours a day.
