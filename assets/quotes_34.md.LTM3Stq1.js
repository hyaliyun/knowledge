The chief of staff of the Prussian Army for thirty years, he is regarded as the creator of a new, more modern method of directing armies in the field. He commanded troops in Europe and the Middle East, commanding during the Second Schleswig War, Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War. He is described as embodying \\"Prussian military organization and tactical genius.\\" He was fascinated with railways and pioneered their military usage. He is often referred to as Moltke the Elder to distinguish him from his nephew Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke, who commanded the German Army at the outbreak of World War I. Early life Moltke was born in Parchim, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, son of the German Generalleutnant in Danish service Friedrich Philipp Victor von Moltke (1768‚Äì1845). In 1805, his father settled in Holstein, but about the same time was left impoverished when the French burned his country house and plundered his townhouse in L√ºbeck, where his wife and children were during the War of the Fourth Coalition of 1806-1807. At nine he was sent as a boarder to Hohenfelde in Holstein, and at age twelve went to the cadet school at Copenhagen, being destined for the Danish army and court. In 1818 he became a page to the king of Denmark and a second lieutenant in a Danish infantry regiment. At twenty-one, Moltke resolved to enter the Prussian service, despite the loss of seniority. In 1822 he became a second lieutenant in the 8th Infantry Regiment stationed at Frankfurt an der Oder. At twenty-three he was allowed to enter the general war school (later called the Prussian Military Academy), where he studied the full three years, graduating in 1826. As a young officer For a year Moltke had charge of a cadet school at Frankfurt an der Oder, then he was for three years employed on the military survey in Silesia and Posen. In 1832 he was seconded for service on the general staff at Berlin, to which he was transferred in 1833 on promotion to first lieutenant. He was at this time regarded as a brilliant officer by his superiors, including Prince William, then a lieutenant-general. Moltke was well received at court and in the best society of Berlin. His tastes inclined him to literature, to historical study and to travel. In 1827 he had published a short romance, The Two Friends. In 1831 he wrote an essay entitled Holland and Belgium in their Mutual Relations, from their Separation under Philip II to their Reunion under William I. A year later he wrote An Account of the Internal Circumstances and Social Conditions of Poland, a study based both on reading and on personal observation of Polish life and character. He was fluent in English and a talented writer in German, so in 1832 he contracted to translate Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire into German, for which he was to receive 75 marks, his object being to earn the money to buy a horse. In eighteen months he had finished nine volumes out of twelve, but the publisher failed to produce the book and Moltke never received more than 25 marks. Service with the Ottoman Empire In 1835 on his promotion as captain, Moltke obtained six months leave to travel in south- eastern Europe. After a short stay in Constantinople he was requested by the Sultan Mahmud II to help modernize the Ottoman Empire army, and being duly authorized from Berlin he accepted the offer. He remained two years at Constantinople, learned Turkish and surveyed the city of Constantinople, the Bosphorus, and the Dardanelles. He travelled through Wallachia, Bulgaria, and Rumelia, and made many other journeys on both sides of the Strait. Moltke (left) advising Ottoman commander Hafiz Pasha at Nezib In 1838 Moltke was sent as an adviser to the Ottoman general commanding the troops in Anatolia, who was to carry on a campaign against Muhammad Ali of Egypt. During the summer Moltke made extensive reconnaissances and surveys, riding several thousand miles in the course of his journey. He navigated the rapids of the Euphrates and visited and mapped many parts of the Ottoman Empire. In 1839 the army moved south to fight the Egyptians, but upon the approach of the enemy, the general refused to listen to Moltke's advice. Moltke resigned his post of staff officer and took charge of the artillery. In the Battle of Nezib (modern-day Nisibis) on 24 June 1839, the Ottoman army was beaten. With great difficulty, Moltke made his way back to the Black Sea, and thence to Constantinople. His patron, Sultan Mahmud II, was dead, so he returned to Berlin where he arrived, broken in health, in December 1839. Once home Moltke published some of the letters he had written as Letters on Conditions and Events in Turkey in the Years 1835 to 1839. This book was well received at the time. Early the next year he married a young English woman, Maria Bertha Helena Burt, the daughter of John Heyliger Burt esq. of St. Croix in the Danish West Indies, who married his sister Augusta. It was a happy union, though there were no children. In 1840 Moltke had been appointed to the staff of the 4th Army Corps, stationed at Berlin and he published his maps of Constantinople, and, jointly with other German travellers, a new map of Asia Minor and a memoir on the geography of that region. He became fascinated by railroads and he was one of the first directors of the Hamburg-Berlin railway. In 1843 he published the article \\"What Considerations should determine the Choice of the Course of Railways?\\" Even before Germany began constructing its first railroad he had noticed their military potential and he urged the general staff to support railway construction for mobilisation and logistical reasons. He spent all of his savings on investments into Prussian railroad ventures which made him a considerable amount of wealth. During his later years in the great general staff he would add a Railways Department, which didn‚Äôt have the task of planning military campaign like many of the other departments, but managed the military use of railways. In 1845 Moltke published The Russo-Turkish Campaign in Europe, 1828‚Äì1829, which was well- received in military circles. In the same year, he served in Rome as personal adjutant to Prince Henry of Prussia, which allowed him to create another map of the Eternal City (published in 1852). In 1848, after a brief return to the General Staff in Berlin, he became Chief of the Staff of the 4th Army Corps, of which the headquarters was then at Magdeburg. There he remained for seven years, during which he rose to Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel. In 1855 Moltke served as personal aide to Prince Frederick (later Emperor Frederick III). He accompanied the prince to England for the prince's marriage, as well as to Paris and Saint Petersburg for the coronation of Alexander II of Russia. Chief of the Prussian General Staff and Great General Staff Statue of Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, near the Berlin Victory Column in the Tiergarten, Berlin, by Joseph Uphues In 1857 Moltke was given the position Chief of the Prussian General Staff, a position he held for the next 30 years (though after the establishment of the German Empire, the Prussian General Staff's title was changed to \\"Great General Staff\\", as it would have overall direction of the various German armies during warArden Bucholz, Moltke, Schlieffen, and Prussian War Planning). As soon as he gained the position he went to work making changes to the strategic and tactical methods of the Prussian army: changes in armament and means of communication; changes in the training of staff officers (such as instituting staff rides); and changes in the method for the mobilization of the army. He also instituted a formal study of European politics in connection with the plans for campaigns which might become necessary. In short, he rapidly put into place the features of a modern general staff. In 1859 the Austro-Sardinian War in Italy caused the mobilization of the Prussian army, though it did not fight. After the mobilization, the army was reorganized and its strength was nearly doubled. The reorganization was the work not of Moltke but of the Prince Regent, William, and the Minister of War, Albrecht von Roon. Moltke watched the Italian campaign closely and wrote a history of it in 1862. In an act that was yet another first in military affairs, this history was attributed on the title-page to the historical division of the Prussian staff. In December 1862 Moltke was asked for an opinion upon the military aspect of the quarrel with Denmark. He thought the difficulty would be to bring the war to an end, as the Danish army would, if possible, retire to the islands, where, as the Danes had the command of the sea, it could not be attacked. He sketched a plan for turning the flank of the Danish army before the attack upon its position in front of Schleswig. He suggested that by this means its retreat might be cut off. War with Denmark Sketch of Helmuth von Moltke When the Second Schleswig War began in February 1864, Moltke was not sent with the Prussian forces, but kept at Berlin. His war plan was mismanaged and the Danish army escaped to the fortresses of Dybb√∏l and Fredericia, each of which commanded a retreat across a strait to an island. Dybb√∏l and Fredericia were besieged, Dybb√∏l taken by storm, and Fredericia abandoned by the Danes without assault ‚Äì but the war showed no signs of ending. The Danish army was safe on the islands of Als and Funen. On April 30, 1864, Moltke was sent to be chief of the staff for the allied (German) forces. After a two-month armistice, the German army attacked the Danes in the island of Als (June 29). The Danes evacuated Als and shortly thereafter agreed to the German peace terms. Moltke's appearance on the scene had transformed the war, and his influence with the king had acquired a firm basis. Accordingly, when in 1866 the quarrel with Austria came to a head, Moltke's plans were adopted and executed. Moltke's theory of war Statue in Parchim, Moltke's birthplace Instructions for Large Unit Commanders, 1869 In contrast to Antoine-Henri Jomini, who expounded a system of rules, Moltke was a disciple of Carl von Clausewitz and regarded strategy as a practical art of adapting means to ends. He had developed the methods of Napoleon in accordance with altered conditions of his age, was the first to realize the great defensive power of modern firearms, and realized that an enveloping attack had become more formidable than an attempt to pierce an enemy's front. One of Moltke‚Äôs trademark strategies, seen in all his plans for war with Russia and France, was what has been called the offensive-defensive strategy, manoeuvring his army to cut the lines of communication of the enemy force and then dig in and defeat the enemy force trying to reestablish its lines of communication in a defensive action. Moltke had pondered the tactics of Napoleon at the Battle of Bautzen, when the emperor brought up Ney's corps, coming from a great distance, against the flank of the allies, rather than to unite it with his own force before the battle; he had also drawn this conclusion from the combined action of the allies at the Battle of Waterloo. Additionally, Moltke realized that the increase in firepower reduced the risk a defender ran in splitting his forces, while the increase in the size of armies made outflanking maneuvers more practical. At the same time Moltke had worked out the conditions of the march and supply of an army. Only one army corps could be moved along one road in the same day; to put two or three corps on the same road meant that the rear corps could not be made use of in a battle at the front. Several corps stationed close together in a small area could not be fed for more than a day or two. Accordingly, he believed that the essence of strategy in his day lay in arrangements for the separation of the corps for marching and their concentration in time for battle. In order to make a large army manageable, it must be broken up into separate armies or groups of corps, each group under a commander authorized to regulate its movements and action subject to the instructions of the commander-in-chief as regards the direction and purpose of its operations. Moltke also realized that the expansion in the size of armies since the 1820s made it essentially impossible to exercise detailed control over the entire force as Napoleon or Wellington had done in battle. Subordinates would have to use initiative and independent judgment for the forces to be effective in battle. Therefore, overall campaign and battle plans should encourage and take advantage of the decentralization that would be necessary in any case. In this new concept, commanders of distant detachments were required to exercise initiative in their decision making and von Moltke emphasized the benefits of developing officers who could do this within the limits of the senior commander's intent. He accomplished this by means of directives stating his intentions, rather than detailed orders, and he was willing to accept deviations from a directive provided that it was within the general framework of the mission. Von Moltke held this view firmly and it later became a fundamental of all German military theory, especially for the field manual Truppenf√ºhrung. Moltke's main thesis was that military strategy had to be understood as a system of options since it was only possible to plan the beginning of a military operation. As a result, he considered the main task of military leaders to consist in the extensive preparation of all possible outcomes. His thesis can be summed up by two statements, one famous and one less so, translated into English as \\"No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength\\" (or \\"no plan survives contact with the enemy\\")Originally in Moltke, Helmuth, Graf von, Militarische Werke. vol. 2, part 2., pp. 33‚Äì40. Found in Hughes, Daniel J. (ed.) Moltke on the Art of War: selected writings. (1993). Presidio Press: New York, New York. . pp. 45‚Äì47 and \\"Strategy is a system of expedients\\". Austro-Prussian War Bismarck, Roon, Moltke, three leaders of Prussia in the 1860s Moltke planned and led the successful military operations during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. In the strategy for the war the main points are as follows. First Moltke demonstrated a concentration of effort. There were two enemy groups opposing the Prussians, the Austro-Saxon armies, 270,000; and their allied North and South German armies, some 120,000 strong. The Prussian forces were smaller by some 60,000, but Moltke was determined to be superior at the decisive point. The army placed against Austria was 278,000 men, leaving just 48,000 men remaining to defend against Austria's German allies. Those 48,000 under Falckenstein managed to capture the Hanoverian army in less than two weeks, and then to attack and drive away the South German forces. In dealing with the Austrian and Saxon army, the difficulty was to have the Prussian army ready first. This was not easy, as the king would not mobilize until after the Austrians. Moltke's railway knowledge helped him to save time. Five railway lines led from the various Prussian provinces to a series of points on the southern frontier. By employing all these railways at once, Moltke had all his army corps moved simultaneously from their peace quarters to the frontier. After marching into Saxony, the Saxon army retreated into Bohemia. Moltke had two Prussian armies about 100 miles apart. The problem was how to bring them together so as to catch the Austrian army between them like the French at Waterloo between Wellington and Bl√ºcher. He determined to bring his own two armies together by directing each of them to advance towards Gitschin. He foresaw that the march of the Crown Prince would probably bring him into collision with a portion of the Austrian army; but the Crown Prince had 100,000 men, and it was not likely that the Austrians could have a stronger force. Wilhelm I on a black horse with his suite, Bismarck, Moltke, Roon, and others, watching the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz The Austrians, under Ludwig von Benedek, marched faster than Moltke expected, and might have opposed Prince Frederick Charles (the Red Prince) with four or five corps; but Benedek's attention was centered on Crown Prince Frederick, and his four corps, not under a common command, were beaten in detail. On July 1, Benedek collected his shaken forces into a defensive position in front of K√∂niggr√§tz. Moltke's two armies were now within a short march of one another and of the enemy. On July 3, they were brought into action, the first army against the Austrian forces and the second against the Austrian right flank. The Austrian army was completely defeated and the campaign and war were won. Moltke was not quite satisfied with the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz. He tried to have the Prussian Army of the Elbe brought up above K√∂niggr√§tz, so as to prevent the Austrian retreat, but its commanding officer failed to get there in time. He also tried to prevent the Prussian First Army from pushing its attack too hard, hoping in that way to keep the Austrians in their position until their retreat should be cut off by the Crown Prince's army, but this also did not happen. During the negotiations, Otto von Bismarck opposed the king's wish to annex the Kingdom of Saxony and other territory beyond what was actually taken; he feared the active intervention of France. Moltke, however, was confident of beating both French and Austrians if the French should intervene, and he submitted to Bismarck his plans in case a war against both France and Austria proved necessary. After the peace, the Prussian government voted Moltke the sum of 30,000 marks (equivalent to approximately 225,000 US$ in 2016), with which he bought the estate of Creisau (present-day Krzy≈ºowa), near Schweidnitz (present-day ≈öwidnica) in the Province of Silesia. In 1867 The Campaign of 1866 in Germany was published. This history was produced under Moltke's personal supervision and was regarded as quite accurate at the time. On December 24, 1868, Moltke's wife died at Berlin. Her remains were buried in a small chapel erected by Moltke as a mausoleum in the park at Creisau. Franco-Prussian War Statue (Leipzig 1888‚Äì1946). The statue was torn down after the communists took power. Moltke again planned and led the Prussian armies in the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì71), which paved the way for the creation of the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871. The aspects of such a war had occupied Moltke's attention almost continuously since 1857; documents published after his death show the many times he considered such a war and the best arrangement of the Prussian or German forces for such a campaign. The arrangements for the transport of the army by railway were revised annually in order to suit the changes in his plans brought about by political conditions and by the growth of the army, as well as by the improvement of the Prussian system of railways. The successes of 1866 had strengthened Moltke's position, so that when on July 5, 1870, the order for the mobilization of the Prussian and South German forces was issued, his plans were adopted without dispute. Five days later he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army for the duration of the war. This gave Moltke the right to issue orders which were equivalent to royal commands. Moltke's plan was to assemble the whole army south of Mainz, this being one district in which a single army could secure the defence of the whole frontier. If the French disregarded the neutrality of Belgium and Luxembourg, and advanced towards Cologne (or any other point on the Lower Rhine), the German army would be able to strike at their flank. At the same time the Rhine itself, with the fortresses of Koblenz, Cologne and Wesel, would be a serious obstacle in their path. If the French should attempt to invade south Germany, an advance by the Germans up the Rhine river would threaten their communications. Moltke expected that the French would be compelled by the direction of their railways to collect the greater part of their army near Metz, and a smaller portion near Strasbourg. The German forces were grouped into three armies: the first of 60,000 men under Steinmetz, on the Moselle below Trier; the second of 130,000 men, under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, around Homburg (with a reserve of 60,000 men behind them); the third under the Crown Prince Frederick of 130,000 men, at Landau. Three army corps were held back in north-Eastern Germany, in case Austria-Hungary should make common cause with France. Moltke's plan was that the three armies, while advancing, should make a right wheel, so that the first army on the right would reach the bank of the Moselle opposite Metz, while the second and third armies should push forward, the third army to defeat the French force near Strasbourg, and the second to strike the Moselle near Pont-√†-Mousson. If the French army should be found in front of the second army, it would be attacked in front by the second army and in flank by the first or the third (or both). If it should be found on or north of the line from Saarburg to Lun√©ville, it could still be attacked from two sides by the second and third armies in co-operation. The intention of the great right wheel was to attack the principal French army in such a direction as to drive it north and cut its communications with Paris. The fortress of Metz was to be only monitored, and the main German forces, after defeating the chief French army, would then march against Paris. This plan was carried out in its broad outlines. The Battle of W√∂rth was brought on prematurely, and therefore led, not to the capture of MacMahon's army, which was intended, but only to its defeat and hasty retreat as far as Ch√¢lons. The Battle of Spicheren was not intended by Moltke, who wished to keep Bazaine's army on the Saar until he could attack it with the second army in front and the first army on its left flank. But these unexpected victories did not disconcert Moltke, who carried out his intended advance to Pont-Mousson, crossed the Moselle with the first and second armies, then faced north and wheeled round, so that the effect of the battle of Gravelotte was to drive Bazaine into the fortress of Metz and cut him off from Paris. Nothing shows Moltke's insight and strength of purpose in a clearer light than his determination to attack on 18 August, at the Battle of Gravelotte, when other strategists would have thought that, the strategic victory having been gained, a tactical victory was unnecessary. He has been blamed for the last attack of Gravelotte, in which there was a fruitless heavy loss; but it is now known that this attack was ordered by the king, and Moltke blamed himself for not having used his influence to prevent it. During the night following the battle Moltke left one army to invest Bazaine at Metz, and set out with the two others to march towards Paris, the more southerly one leading, so that when MacMahon's army should be found the main blow might be delivered from the south and MacMahon driven to the north. On August 25 it was found that MacMahon was moving north-east for the relief of Bazaine. The moment Moltke was satisfied of the accuracy of his information, he ordered the German columns to turn their faces north instead of west. MacMahon's right wing was attacked at Beaumont while attempting to cross the Meuse, his advance necessarily abandoned, and his army with difficulty collected at Sedan. At the Battle of Sedan, the two German armies surrounded the French army, which on September 1 was attacked from multiple sides and compelled to surrender. Moltke then resumed the advance on Paris, which was also surrounded. From this time Moltke's strategy is remarkable for its judicious economy of force, for he was wise enough never to attempt more than was practicable with the means at his disposal. The surrender of Metz and of Paris was just a question of time, and the problem was, while maintaining the sieges, to be able to ward off the attacks of the new French armies levied for the purpose of raising the Siege of Paris. The Siege of Metz ended with its surrender on October 27. On January 28, 1871, an armistice was concluded at Versailles by which the garrison became virtually prisoners and the war was ended.

In October 1870, Moltke was made a Graf (Count) as a reward for his services during the Franco-Prussian War and victory at the Battle of Sedan. In June 1871, he was further rewarded by a promotion to the rank of field marshal and a large monetary grant. He served in the Diet of the North German Confederation from 1867‚Äì71, and from 1871‚Äì91 he was a member of the Reichstag (federal parliament). For \\"meritorious achievements for the unified, reborn German fatherland\\" (Verdienste um das zur Einheit wiedergeborene Deutsche Vaterland) he was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg. Moltke superintended the preparation of the official history of the Franco-Prussian War, which was published between 1874 and 1881 by the German General Staff. After the war, he became a national hero and celebrity. More than 50 monuments to Moltke were erected throughout Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; some were destroyed during or after World War II but many remain. When Moltke retired in 1888 as Chief of the General Staff, he was succeeded by Alfred von Waldersee. (His nephew, Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke, was chief from 1906 to 1914.) Moltke officially retired from active service on August 9, 1888. His 90th birthday on October 26, 1890 was declared a national holiday. Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke died at his home in Berlin on April 24, 1891 after a short illness. He received a state funeral where his body lay in state surrounded by military honors and thousands paid their respects, including Kaiser Wilhelm II; Bismarck did not attend. Thousands of troops, led by the Kaiser, escorted his casket to Berlin's Lehrter Railroad Station, from which it was transported to Silesia.Otto Friedrich, Blood & Iron: From Bismarck to Hitler the von Moltke Family‚Äôs Impact on German History (HarperPerennial, 1995), pp. 10‚Äì15. Moltke's remains were interred in the family mausoleum on the Kreisau estate, which however was plundered after the Second World War, when Kreisau (now Krzy≈ºowa) was lost to Poland. No trace of his remains is known to exist.Friedrich, Blood & Iron, pp. 411‚Äì12. Personal life Moltke was married to Mary von Burt (1825-1868), the stepdaughter of his sister Auguste (1809-1883). They were married in Itzehoe on April 20, 1842 and remained married until Mary's death on December 24, 1868. History of sound recording On October 21, 1889, Moltke made two audio recordings with Adelbert Theodor Wangemann, a German native who worked with Thomas Edison and had been sent to Europe with Edison's newly invented cylinder phonograph.Ron Cowen, \\"Restored Edison Records Revive Giants of 19th- Century Germany\\" The New York Times (January 30, 2012). Retrieved February 1, 2012 Moltke recorded a line from Shakespeare‚Äôs Hamlet, Act 1, Scene 3 (‚ÄúDein Ohr leih Jedem, Wen‚Äôgen deine Stimme\\" - Give every man thy ear but few thy voice) and a passage from Goethe‚Äôs \\"Faust\\" on two wax cylinders, recordings which were lost until 1957 and were unidentified for decades after. On January 30, 2012, they were among a number of recordings revealed by the Thomas Edison National Historical Park.

He was also the nephew of Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke who is commonly called \\"Moltke the Elder\\" to differentiate the two. Upon becoming the head of the General Staff, Moltke led the German Army from 1 January 1906 to 14 September 1914 during the opening months of World War I. His legacy remains a matter of controversy due to his involvement in Germany‚Äôs decision to go to war and the failure of the Schlieffen Plan. Early career Helmuth von Moltke was born in Biendorf, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and was named after his uncle, Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke, future Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) and hero of the Unification of Germany. During the Franco-Prussian War, Moltke served with the 7th Grenadier Regiment and was cited for bravery. He attended the War Academy between 1875 and 1878 and joined the General Staff in 1880. In 1882 he became personal adjutant to his uncle, who was then Chief of the General Staff. In 1891, on the death of his uncle, Moltke became aide-de-camp to Kaiser Wilhem II, thus becoming part of the Emperor's inner circle. In 1898 he became commander of the 1st Guards Infantry Brigade and in 1902, being promoted to Lieutenant General, received command of the 1st Guards Infantry Division. Rise to the General Staff In 1904 Moltke was made Quartermaster- General; in effect, Deputy Chief of the General Staff. In 1906, he became chief on the retirement of Alfred von Schlieffen. His appointment was controversial then and remains so today. The other likely candidates for the position were Hans Hartwig von Beseler, Karl von B√ºlow and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz. Critics charge that Moltke gained the position on the strength of his name and his friendship with the Kaiser, whom he was certainly far closer to than the other candidates. Historians argue that Beseler was too close to Schlieffen to have succeeded him, while B√ºlow and Goltz were too independent for Wilhelm to have accepted them. Moltke's friendship with the Kaiser permitted him a latitude that others could not have enjoyed. Goltz, at least, saw nothing wrong with Moltke's performance as Chief. Marne campaign Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914, Moltke was called to the Kaiser who had been told by Karl Max, Prince Lichnowsky, that the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, had offered French neutrality under guarantee of Great Britain.The Historical Journal, 37, 4 (1994), pp. 885‚Äì889, Cambridge University Press According to John Keegan however, the Kaiser believed that Britain would remain neutral if Germany did not attack France. Whichever is true, the Kaiser, seeing that a two-front war could be avoided, told Moltke to divert forces from the western to the eastern front against Russia. Moltke refused, arguing that such a drastic alteration of a long-planned major mobilization could not be done without throwing the forces into organizational chaos and the original plan now in motion must be followed through. Years later, General , head of the German railway division, would disagree in a book detailing a contingency plan that the German army had for such a situation. Grey's offer turned out to be a wishful misinterpretation by Lichnowsky and the Kaiser told Moltke to proceed as originally planned. Moltke's health, already stressed from this argument with his ruler, broke down as a consequence of German defeat at the first battle of the Marne, and on 14 September 1914, he was succeeded by Erich von Falkenhayn. It is a matter of debate whether the \\"failure\\" of the Marne Campaign can be placed at Moltke's feet. Some critics contend that Moltke's weakening of the Schlieffen Plan led to German defeat. The records show that Moltke, who was concerned about Russia, moved 180,000 men east before the war. Many thousands more men were transported from the crucial right wing to the left wing facing France in Alsace and Lorraine. Most controversially, on 28 August, Moltke sent two corps and a cavalry division to reinforce Ludendorff and Hindenburg, just before the epic victory at the Battle of Tannenberg. The series of moves has been viewed by some historians as responsible for much of the strategic failure of the Schlieffen Plan as enacted in 1914. A number of historians, notably Zuber and S. L. A. Marshall, contend that the failure of Alexander von Kluck's 1st Army to keep position with Karl von B√ºlow's 2nd Army, thus creating a gap near Paris that was exploited by the French, is a more direct cause than any planning foibles on Moltke's part. The Schlieffen School disagrees and argues that Moltke lost control of the invading armies during the month of August and thus was unable to react when the First Battle of the Marne developed in September. While Moltke had lost touch with his field commanders, German operational doctrine had always stressed (personal initiative) on the part of subordinate officers, more so than in other armies. Other historians argue that the multitude of strategic options Moltke faced and the danger of the Russian invasion of East Prussia clouded Moltke's judgement. Although earlier in the campaign, German generals and the press had been proclaiming the campaign as good as won, on 4 September, Moltke was found despondent that the lack of prisoners meant that the Germans had not yet really won a decisive victory. Moltke may well have been overly preoccupied with the unsuccessful German offensive in Lorraine, and he issued no orders to the First, Second and Third Armies between 2 and 5 September whilst the Battle of the Marne was in progress. Following the German retreat from the Marne, Moltke allegedly reported to the Kaiser, \\"Your Majesty, we have lost the war.\\"\\"Majest√§t, wir haben den Krieg verloren\\" in , Der Erste Weltkrieg, Bertelsmann Lexikon-Verlag (1977) p. 18.] jellepeters.com Later life Grave of Helmuth von Moltke in the Invalids' Cemetery (Invalidenfriedhof), Berlin (restitution stone from 2007) After being succeeded by Falkenhayn, Moltke was entrusted in Berlin with the office of chief of the home substitute for the general staff (Der stellvertretende Generalstab), which had the task of organising and forwarding the reserves and of controlling the territorial army corps, corresponding to those at the front. Moltke's health continued to deteriorate and he died in Berlin on 18 June 1916, during the Staatsakt (memorial state ceremony) for Marshal Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz. He left a pamphlet entitled Die 'Schuld' am Kriege (The Blame for the War), which his widow Eliza intended to publish in 1919. She was dissuaded from doing so because of the problems it might cause. The pamphlet was designed to show the \\"chaotic\\" nature of events leading up to the war, to counter Allied accusations of warmongering by Germany. Army chiefs and the German foreign ministry were disturbed by its contents. General Wilhelm von Dommes was sent to advise Eliza von Moltke against its publication. Having read the pamphlet he confided to his diary that it \\"contains nasty stuff\\". Instead, Eliza published the more bland Erinnerungen, Briefe, Dokumente, a collection of her husband's letters and documents. Other material was archived. Some was later destroyed in World War II and the original pamphlet has not been accessible since. Personal life At sixty-six, Moltke was one of the older commanders of 1914 and in poor health, having suffered a stroke shortly before the outbreak of the war. These factors negatively affected his determination when he was under stress. His personal interests included music, painting and literature. While often assertive in manner, his character was assessed by the historian Barbara W. Tuchman as being essentially that of a self-doubting introvert.Barbara W. Tuchman, page 99 \\"The Guns of August\\", Four Square Edition 1964 Moltke was a follower of theosophy, which taught that humanity was an endless, unchanging cycle of civilizations rising and falling. Historian Margaret MacMillan connected his personal beliefs with his resigned approach to the possibility of a general war in the lead-up to the First World War. Like many of his colleagues on the German General Staff, he was heavily influenced by Social Darwinism. His view of international relations as merely a struggle for survival led him to believe that the longer the start of the war was delayed the worse things would be for Germany.

Studies show that the sex flush occurs in approximately 50‚Äì75% of females and 25% of males, yet not consistently. The sex flush tends to occur more often under warmer conditions and may not appear at all under lower temperatures. During the female sex flush, pinkish spots develop under the breasts, then spread to the breasts, torso, face, hands, soles of the feet, and possibly over the entire body. Vasocongestion is also responsible for the darkening of the clitoris and the walls of the vagina during sexual arousal. During the male sex flush, the coloration of the skin develops less consistently than in the female, but typically starts with the epigastrium (upper abdomen), spreads across the chest, then continues to the neck, face, forehead, back, and sometimes, shoulders and forearms. The sex flush typically disappears soon after reaching orgasm, but in other cases, may take up to two hours or more, and sometimes intense sweating occurs simultaneously.

He was a founding member of the Kreisau Circle opposition group, whose members opposed the government of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany, and discussed prospects for a Germany based on moral and democratic principles after Hitler. The Nazi government executed him for treason for his participation in these discussions. Moltke was the grandnephew of Helmuth von Moltke the Younger and the great-grandnephew of Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, the victorious commander in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars, from whom he inherited the Kreisau estate in Prussian Silesia, now Krzy≈ºowa in Poland. Early life Moltke was born in Kreisau (now Krzy≈ºowa, ≈öwidnica County, Poland) in the Prussian Province of Silesia. His mother, Dorothy (n√©e Rose Innes), was a South African of British descent, the daughter of Sir James Rose Innes, Chief Justice of the Union of South Africa from 1914 to 1927.Innes, James Rose, James Rose Innes: Chief Justice of South Africa, 1914-27 : Autobiography Oxford University Press (1949).

Lead article in the Report to Members\\" (Spring/Summer 2009) Longyear Museum, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, United States For reasons of family tradition, Moltke decided to become confirmed in the Evangelical Church of Prussia when he was 14.von Moltke, Dorothy (1999), p. XII Education From 1927 to 1929, Moltke studied law and political sciences in Breslau, Vienna, Heidelberg, and Berlin. In 1928, Moltke became involved with college teachers and youth movement leaders in the organization of the L√∂wenberger Arbeitsgemeinschaften (L√∂wenberg working groups) in which unemployed young workers and young farmers were brought together with students so that they could learn from one another. They also discussed civics, obligations, and rights. In Kreisau, Moltke set aside an unused part of the estate for farming startups, which earned him harsh criticism from neighbouring landowners. In 1931, he married Freya Deichmann, whom he met in Austria. In 1934, Moltke took his junior law examination. In 1935, he declined the chance to become a judge to avoid having to join the Nazi Party. Instead, he opened a law practice in Berlin. As a lawyer dealing in international law, he helped victims of Hitler's r√©gime emigrate, and he traveled abroad to maintain contacts. Between 1935 and 1938, Moltke regularly visited Great Britain, where he completed English legal training in London and Oxford. International law division of the Abwehr In 1939, World War II began with the German invasion of Poland. Moltke was immediately drafted at the beginning of the Polish campaign by the Abwehr, the High Command of the Armed Forces (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht), Counter-Intelligence Service, Foreign Division, under Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, as an expert in martial law and international public law. Moltke's work for the Abwehr mainly involved gathering insights from abroad, from military attach√©s and foreign newspapers, and news of military-political importance, and relaying this information to the Wehrmacht. He maintained the connection between the OKW and the Foreign Office, but above all to provide appraisals of questions of the international laws of war. Unusually, he chose not to wear a uniform. In his travels through German- occupied Europe, he observed many human rights abuses, which he attempted to thwart by insisting for Germany to observe the Geneva Convention and by local actions in creating more benign outcomes for local inhabitants, citing legal principles. In October 1941, Moltke wrote, \\"Certainly more than a thousand people are murdered in this way every day, and another thousand German men are habituated to murder.... What shall I say when I am asked: And what did you do during that time?\\" In the same letter he said, \\"Since Saturday the Berlin Jews are being rounded up. Then they are sent off with what they can carry.... How can anyone know these things and walk around free?\\" Moltke hoped that his appraisals could have a humanitarian effect on military actions; he was supported by anti-Hitler officers such as Canaris and Major General Hans Oster, Chief of the Central Division. During Nazi Germany's war with the Soviet Union, Moltke wrote a memorandum urging the Wehrmacht to follow both the Geneva Convention and the Hague Convention, in order to comply with international law and to promote reciprocal good treatment for German prisoners of war, but the recommendation was rejected by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, who scribbled on the margin that \\"The objections arise from the military concept of chivalrous warfare\\". Moltke invoked international law and political reasoning to stop the shooting of hostages in Holland, and had a hand in warning Danes of the impending planned deportation of Danish Jews. Having access to information about deportations and the shootings of hostages reinforced Moltke's opposition to the war and the entire program of the Nazi party. Moltke was in contact with Aim√©e Sotto Maior, later called Aim√©e de Heeren. A Brazilian Secret Service Agent that had come to Paris in 1938 under the cover of a wealthy heiress and fashion shopper. In 1943, Moltke traveled to Istanbul on two occasions. The official reason was to retrieve some German merchant ships impounded by Turkey. The real reason, however, was his participation in an effort to end the war by a coalition of anti-Hitler elements of the German Army, German refugees living in Turkey, members of the OSS, the Abwehr (German military intelligence) and the German ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen. This group passed a report to the Allies, which reached President Franklin Roosevelt. However, Roosevelt's advisers, including Henry Morgenthau Jr., counseled against the credibility of the report. Nonviolent opposition to Nazi rule Moltke also surreptitiously spread the information to which he was privy, on the war and the Nazi concentration camps, to friends outside the Nazi party, including members of the Resistance in occupied Europe. Declassified British documents reveal that he twice attempted to contact British officials, including friends from Oxford, offering to \\"go to any length\\" to assist them, but the British refused the first time, confusing him with his uncle, the German ambassador to Spain, and replied to the second offer by asking for \\"deeds\\" rather than \\"talk\\". Moltke possessed strong religious convictions. In a 1942 letter smuggled to a British friend Lionel Curtis, Moltke wrote: \\"Today, not a numerous, but an active part of the German people are beginning to realize, not that they have been led astray, not that bad times await them, not that the war may end in defeat, but that what is happening is sin and that they are personally responsible for each terrible deed that has been committed - naturally, not in the earthly sense, but as Christians\\". In the same letter, Moltke wrote that before World War II, he had believed that it was possible to be totally opposed to National Socialism without believing in God, but he now declared his former ideas to be \\"wrong, completely wrong\\". In Moltke's opinion, only by believing in God could one be a total opponent of the Nazis. Kreisau Circle The von Moltke main house at Kreisau In Berlin Moltke had a circle of acquaintances who opposed Nazism and who met frequently there, but on three occasions met at Kreisau. These three incidental gatherings were the basis for the term \\"Kreisau Circle\\". The meetings at Kreisau had an agenda of well-organized discussion topics, starting with relatively innocuous ones as cover. The topics of the first meeting of May 1942 included the failure of German educational and religious institutions to fend off the rise of Nazism. The theme of the second meeting in the autumn of 1942 was on post-war reconstruction, assuming the likely defeat of Germany. This included both economic planning and self- government, developing a pan-European concept that pre-dated the European Union, summarized in documented resolutions. The third meeting, in June 1943, addressed how to handle the legacy of Nazi war crimes after the fall of the dictatorship. These and other meetings resulted in \\"Principles for the New [Post-Nazi] Order\\" and \\"Directions to Regional Commissioners\\", works, which Moltke asked his wife, Freya, to hide in a place that not even he knew. Moltke opposed the assassination of Hitler. He pointed out that if one succeeded, Hitler would become a martyr, and if it failed, that would expose those few individuals among the German leadership who could be counted on to build a democratic state after the collapse of the Third Reich. On 20 July 1944, there was an attempt on Hitler's life, which the Gestapo used as a pretext to eliminate perceived opponents to the Nazi regime. In the aftermath of the plot, some 5000 of Hitler's opponents were executed. Arrest, trial and execution Moltke at the Volksgerichtshof Moltke's mindset and his objections to orders that were at odds with international law both put him at risk of arrest. Indeed, the Gestapo arrested him in January 1944. A year later, in January 1945, he stood, along with several of his fellow r√©gime opponents, before the People's Court (Volksgerichtshof), presided over by Roland Freisler. Because no evidence could be found that Moltke had participated in any conspiracy to bring about a coup d'√©tat, Freisler had to invent a charge de novo. Since Moltke and his friends had discussed a Germany based on moral and democratic principles that could develop after Hitler, Freisler deemed this discussion as treason, a crime worthy of death. Hanns Lilje writes in his autobiography that as Moltke stood before the Volksgerichtshof, he had \\"possessed, in the face of clear recognition of the fact that the death penalty had already been decided, the moral courage for an attack on Freisler and the whole institution\\". In two letters written to his wife in January 1945 while imprisoned at Tegel, Moltke noted with considerable pride that he was to be executed for his ideas, not his actions, a point that had been underlined a number of times by Freisler. In one letter, Moltke noted \\"Thus it is documented, that not plans, not preparations, but the spirit as such shall be persecuted. Vivat Freisler!\\" In the second letter, Moltke claimed that he stood before the court \\"...not as a Protestant, not as a great landowner, not as an aristocrat, not as a Prussian, not as a German...but as a Christian and nothing else\\". He wrote: \\"But what the Third Reich is so terrified of ... is ultimately the following: a private individual, your husband, of whom it is established that he discussed with 2 clergymen of both denominations [Protestant and Catholic] ... questions of the practical, ethical demands of Christianity. Nothing else; for that alone we are condemned.... I just wept a little, not because I was sad or melancholy ... but because I am thankful and moved by this proof of God's presence.\\" Moltke was sentenced to death on 11 January 1945 and hanged twelve days later at Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin.Susanne Eckelmann, Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, Deutsches Historisches Museum, 14 September 2014. In a letter written while in custody, he revealed his motivation for resistance to his two sons: \\"Since National Socialism came to power, I have striven to make its consequences milder for its victims and to prepare the way for a change. In that, my conscience drove me - and in the end, that is a man's duty.\\"Original quotation: \\"Nationalsozialismus zur Macht gekommen ist, habe ich mich bem√ºht, seine Folgen f√ºr seine Opfer zu mildern und einer Wandlung den Weg zu bereiten. Dazu hat mich mein Gewissen getrieben‚Äîund schlie√ülich ist das eine Aufgabe f√ºr einen Mann.\\" Recognition Memorial stone to Moltke and his brother at Kreisau (now Krzy≈ºowa, Poland) In 1989, Moltke was posthumously awarded the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis for his work, Briefe an Freya 1939‚Äì1945. In 2001 the German Section of the International Society for Military Law and the Law of War established the Helmuth-James-von-Moltke-Preis for outstanding judicial works in the field of security policy. As Germany continues to shed light on the internal dynamics of the Nazi era, Moltke has become a prominent symbol of moral opposition to the Nazi regime. On 11 March 2007, Moltke's centenary was commemorated in the Franz√∂sischer Dom in Berlin, where he was described by German chancellor Angela Merkel as a symbol of \\"European courage\\". His life was the subject of a 1992 documentary film nominated for an Oscar, The Restless Conscience: Resistance to Hitler Within Germany 1933-1945. A biography by G√ºnter Brakelmann compiles Moltke's letters, diary, and other papers shared by his wife. Scott Horton, chair of the New York City bar committee on international law, cited parallels between the attitudes of the German general staff during World War II and those of the George W. Bush administration during the Iraq War, regarding adherence to the Geneva and Hague Conventions, both having referred to those treaties as ‚Äúquaint‚Äù and ‚Äúobsolete,‚Äù and not applicable to the mode of warfare practiced in either era. He reported that von Moltke \\"pleaded in forceful terms for respect of the Geneva Convention rights of enemy soldiers, civilians, and irregular combatants on the East Front, mustering a series of arguments that bear remarkable similarity to a memorandum sent by Colin Powell to President Bush 60 years later\\".

At the beginning of each new Parliament, each person who has established his or her right to attend Parliament is issued a writ of summons. Without the writ, s/he is unable to sit or vote in Parliament. History Writs of summons generally follow the same form, whose nature has changed but little over the centuries. The words \\"writ\\" and \\"summons\\" appear nowhere in the writ. Additional text may appear in the writ. For example, in the year 1264-5. At that time, Henry III of England was concerned for his first-born, The Lord Edward because he had been ransomed for the more equitable distribution of power, which in the event was obtained by the Parliament holden at London on 20 January 1265. By 1295 now under Edward I of England the form had changed. In fact, the writs of summons to that Parliament \\"are evidence about the nature and function of the developing body.\\" The forms of address are particularly curious as they number three in type: whether it was to a prelate, a baron or a representative of a shire or town. And the latter are informed that \\"Since we intend to have a consultation and meeting with the barons\\" now therefore \\"we strictly require you to cause... to be elected without delay\\" various delegates of the lieux. Charles I (pictured) attempted to withhold a writ of summons for John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol in 1626. It is established precedent that the sovereign may not deny writs of summons to qualified peers. In 1626, King Charles I ordered that the writ of summons of John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol not be issued. Lord Bristol had been charged with treason but was never tried. He complained to the House of Lords, which resolved that the denial of a writ to an eligible peer was without precedent and that the sovereign should immediately issue a writ of summons, which did occur. Modern forms=To Peers Modern summonses are without reference to royal hostages but in essence they flow in the same way. Firstly, they set out the titles of the Sovereign, and then those of the recipient. Next, they note the date for Parliament's calling and the reason for its calling. This portion of the writ differs based on whether Parliament is at the time sitting, or prorogued, or dissolved. Then, after commanding the recipient to attend, the writ indicates that the sovereign him or herself witnesses it. The form of writs issued to Peers while Parliament is dissolved is as follows: In the case of writs issued to Peers when Parliament is prorogued, the form of the first sentence of the second paragraph changes: In the case of writs issued during a session of Parliament, the form of the first sentence of the second paragraph changes: References Category:Westminster system Category:Parliamentary procedure Category:Politics of the United Kingdom Category:Government in Canada Category:Constitution of the United Kingdom Category:Constitution of Australia Category:Constitution of Canada Category:Constitution of New Zealand ","title":"Writ of summons"},{"id":"439385","text":"The game was allegedly invented in an underground poker club at Hammarbykajen, Stockholm in Sweden owned by the Russian mafia. The game is a variation of the Swedish card game, Fem-kort. The poker-related card game called Chicago is one of the most popular card games in Finland today. Relying on the keeping of score instead of the placing of bets, it is suitable even for environments such as schools, where gambling is often prohibited. The game exists in countless versions, so here a (somewhat arbitrarily chosen) basic game will be followed by a number of possible variations.  Hand scores  The backbone of the game is that each poker hand has its own point value, as given in this table: * One pair - 1 point. * Two pair - 2 points. * Three of a kind - 3 points. * Straight - 4 points. * Flush - 5 points. * Full house - 6 points. * Four of a kind - 7 points (but see Variations below). * Straight flush - 8 points (but see Variations below). *Royal Flush - 20 points (but see Variations below).  Basic rules  Chicago is played with a standard 52-card deck. Each player is dealt five cards. The objective is to reach 52 points.  Exchanges and hand scoring  The players are allowed to exchange any number of their cards. If a player chooses to exchange one card only, he may choose \\"one up\\", meaning that he is dealt one card faced up, which he can either accept, or instead take the next card unseen. After the exchanges, the player with the best hand (and only one player) gets points for his hand. Then follows another round of exchanges, but no hand scoring.  The game  Now, the first player begins by playing one card. Ordinary whist rules apply, but the players keep their cards collected by themselves. The player who wins the last trick gets 5 points. Also, the player with the best hand (whether it is the same player or not) gets points for his hand. After achieving 42 points a player is no longer permitted to trade cards as they normally would. Instead, they are dealt 6 cards at the beginning of the game and must discard one before the first scoring round. No further exchanges are permitted.  Chicago  After the second exchange, any player can choose to play Chicago. In this case, he pledges himself to win all the tricks of the game. If he does, he is awarded 15 points, but if he fails, the penalty is just as harsh: -15 points.  Blind Chicago  In addition to the conventional Chicago mentioned above, a player may also elect to pull a Blind Chicago. As with the standard Chicago, during a Blind Chicago a player also pledges to win all the tricks - however he announces his intention to do so before having ever seen his cards. In other words, a Blind Chicago can only be announced immediately after the last card leaves the dealer's hand. If he succeeds, a player is rewarded 30 points, with 20 deducted in the event of failure. If a Blind Chicago is announced, no players are awarded points for their poker hands in any of the phases. The player attempting the Blind Chicago may trade as he normally would. Also note that if a player succeeds in completing the Blind Chicago on a deuce, he is awarded 60 points - an automatic game win.  Variations  * Sometimes, a player given five cards below ten (either inclusive or exclusive - must be decided before game starts) is allowed to replace them before the exchanges begin. * Some play with 3 exchanges instead of 2. Then of course, scoring for hands will be made after both the first and the second exchange. * Some do not use the \\"one up\\" rule. * Often, a game will require that a player declare \\"Chicago\\" before they can win the game. The declaration is accepted regardless of whether one wins or loses the 5 tricks. *Often, one awards 8 for Four of a kind instead of 7, 11 for Straight flush instead of 7 and a win for a Royal flush instead of 20. * Often, one wants to give higher rewards than 7 or 8 points for four of a kind and straight flush respectively. There are several ways to achieve this, most notably by elevating the player immediately to 52 points, or lowering either all players or one player of the holder's choice to 0 points, or a combination of these. Some also separate the royal flush from the straight flush, awarding 9 points for a royal flush. Holding a royal flush usually means immediate victory. * The confusion is great as to what scores are appointed in the case of Chicago. Some will argue that no player will get any points at all besides the +15 or -15, whilst others will allow other points to be awarded. The +5 for the game, however, can never be stacked with the +15 for Chicago. Yet another variation is to award +13/-13 points for Chicago and the declaring player gets to go first. In that variation it is forbidden to declare Chicago unless the player has reached 13 points, ruling out the possibility of a negative score. * Some prescribe that any player with 45 points or more is not allowed to replace any cards. * Some require that after (and not in the same hand as) a player reaches 52 points, he must win the game once more before he actually wins. This handles the possibility that more than one player reach 52 points in the same hand. * Some award 10 points instead of 5 if the last trick is taken with a deuce. If this variant is employed, 30 points must also be awarded for a Chicago hand successfully ended with a deuce. External links * Glimne, Dan (2016).

Charles Herbert (Herbie) Little was born and raised in Mount Forest, Ontario. He won scholarships to Upper Canada College (graduating in 1926) and Trinity College, Toronto (class of 1930) where he majored in German and played ice hockey, football, and cricket. He was a member of the Beta Psi fraternity. He was offered a contract with the Montreal Maroons ice hockey team but decided to continue his studies instead. He was selected as a Rhodes Scholar and continued Germanic studies at Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating in 1932. While there he was captain of the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club that won the Spengler Cup two years in a row. On his return to Canada, he married Ruth B. Harrison of Rothesay, New Brunswick. He taught at Upper Canada College until he joined the Royal Canadian Navy at the outbreak of the war in 1939. Little presented himself at HMCS York in Toronto, but after he mentioned that he was a teacher of German and that he had just returned from a trip to Germany, he was immediately sent to Ottawa. Upon his arrival he was asked to go through some captured German documents, some of which seemed to describe a weapon. Those papers were sent to London and were found to be partial plans for the new magnetic mines being used by the German Navy. During the war he served as Director of Naval Intelligence on the Naval Staff. Because of his position he was one of the few Canadians to handle Ultra decrypts. After the defeat of Nazi Germany he was allowed to enter combat and was sent to join the British Pacific Fleet. He remained in the Navy until 1959, helping to develop the University Naval Training Division and the Regular Officer Training Plan. After leaving the Navy he became a federal civil servant. From 1964 to 1971 he was Chief Editor of the Royal Commission on Pilotage. He wrote ten historical books, a book of poetry and numerous articles. He was a lifelong contributor to the Royal Canadian Geographical Society Journal. He was made a fellow of the society in 1969 (FRCGS). He was given an award by the Spanish government for his history of Spanish exploration of the west coast of Canada. He was National President of the Canadian Authors' Association from 1972 to 1975 and was made Honorary President in 2001. He was president of the Canadian Writers' Foundation from 1978 to 2001 and was Honorary President thereafter. In 1977 he was awarded the Queen's Jubilee Medal. In 1991 he was awarded the Admirals' Medal. In 2000 at the age of 92, he dropped the puck at the start of the 100th annual Oxford vs Cambridge Ice Hockey game. He died in Ottawa at the age of 96.

As his parents were coconut farmers, Somporn experienced the traditional use of monkeys for the harvest of coconuts. The monkeys were often beaten by their owners when they didn't perform as expected (e.g. when they left ripe coconuts on the tree). This gave him the idea to teach monkeys in a better way. His Buddhist teacher, the famous monk Phra Buddhadasa from the nearby temple Wat Suan Mokkha in Chaiya, encouraged him to teach monkeys in a positive way, without the use of force. In 1957 he started to teach monkeys and developed his unique teaching style. As it is illegal to catch wild monkeys in Thailand, the students of the monkey school - pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) - were brought in by their owners for the education only. In the first step the monkey has to get used to humans, then it will be shown how to turn a coconut. Next the coconut is fixed on a pole, later even higher on a tree. After six months of training they are ready for picking the ripe coconuts from the trees. In time his school became locally famous, and the largest monkey school of all southern Thailand. In 1993 Somporn together with his favourite monkey Khai Nui carried the provincial flag in the opening ceremony of the National Games held in Surat Thani. At the same time his school became a tourist attraction as well, showing the teaching methods as well as the special performance of his best student. Somporn died in 2002 after a heart attack. His school is continued by relatives.

The men were two libertarian journalists of a similar political viewpoint as much of the Labour government, and a resigned GCHQ source seeking to heighten scrutiny of government-authorised wire-tapping and limit the work of the American agency, the CIA, in Britain. These aims were furthered in the following two decades achieved through detailed parliamentary scrutiny into and regular reports as to the work of security services, a Freedom of Information Committee and regulation of wire-tapping. Aside from very limited reportage from the Central Criminal Court, its early analysis comes in the account of one of its investigative-journalist defendants, Duncan Campbell, in the annual journal The Socialist Register. Background London magazine Time Out in 1976, through the writings of the first and third defendants, published a two-page account of GCHQ called \\"The Wiretappers\\", this was among other evidence collected and imparted by the defendants as to how GCHQ operates from year-to-year including gathered evidence, such as photographs of radio masts, of its physical apparatus. By statute, (Labour)'s Attorney General would need to condone the prosecution for it to proceed; he did so. The case took place from September to November 1978Aldrich, Richard J. 'Unmasking GCHQ: the ABC Trial' in GCHQ: The Uncensored Story of Britain's Most Secret Intelligence Agency, Harper Press 2010 - still in an era of vital surveillance to counter Cold War and Irish and Northern Irish dissident republicans ongoing threats. Conviction of some form was assured as all parties could not deny a small amount of classified information had been communicated and no tenable argument of the law as to freedom of information such as on the basis of freedom of expression was raised. However the case followed the importation from the USA of post- Watergate investigative journalism, which had been adopted by radical and left journalists at a considerable speed during 1975. Its popular legitimacy was outcry against the misused suppression of information on the false basis of \\"national security\\" as Congress and the Senate found was misused by Nixon and the Intelligence Agency to cover up misdeeds. What had come from the United States was a new legitimacy for the idea that the secret agencies should be capable of a certain amount of press reporting and face close democratic scrutiny. Summary The trial was held in Court 1 of the Central Criminal Court. It was against the defendants: Crispin Aubrey, John Berry and Duncan Campbell; the latter also being subject for cuttings and photographs gathered to a section 1 charge, dropped before the close of the trial, the judge stating they were \\"oppressive in the circumstances\\". Aubrey was a journalist for Time Out, John Berry was a former Corporal in signals intelligence (SIGINT), and Duncan Campbell was an investigative journalist. One of the prosecution witnesses was an anonymous SIGINT (that is, electronic communications) officer, referred to as Colonel B. Campbell's 1979 identified him as Colonel Johnstone. The trial found that the information came almost entirely from open publications, some of which from the USA. The jury confirmed guilt (convicted) as to the remaining (non-dropped) section 2 offence as to disclosure of those classified matters in no way in the public domain. The only penalty imposed was against Berry and was non-custodial; but criminal records of all three would hamper certain sensitive employment. In 1979 Campbell wrote an article, including the words \\"It ended in convictions under Section 2 for each of us, but with negligible penalty - in the case of myself and fellow journalist Aubrey, no penalty at all.\\".*Campbell, Duncan (1979). \\"Official Secrecy and British Libertarianism\\" in The Socialist Register This added \\"'Colonel B' rapidly achieved the position of a national figure of ridicule.\\". In Campbell's view many editorials mentioning the unnecessarily secretive governance of and occasionally counter-productive application of protected status to essentially all information at and concerning GCHQ largely fuelled the decision by the Liberal Party, successful in the random selection of private member's Bills via Clement Freud, to select a Freedom of Information Bill. The bill, a forerunner of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, lapsed with the end of the Callaghan ministry but achieved a wholly unopposed second Commons reading, reflecting a sea change among those dominant legislative members (British MPs). The section 1 charge \\"lacked the legitimation which could be provided by the existence of a subversive or hostile threat, the presentation of their evidence rapidly became ridiculous. The information [Campbell] had gathered, dealt with piecemeal, was of course readily available in pvblic. As witness after witness conceded this point, the prosecution rapidly lost any sense of purpose.\\". The prosecution dropped this charge. The contemporary drive of most of the security services with making themselves and their nature top secret, already widely suspected, was criticised in the centrist, libertarian 1979 article by Campbell, citing in support Tony Bunyan's 1976 book: The Political Police in Britain which opined that Official Secrets Acts, as then applied and interpreted in the courts, \\"represent the last resort in suppressing public knowledge of the workings of the state\\".Tony Bunyan, The Political Police in Britain, Julian Friedman, 1976 The quickly rubbished first jury, its foreman and others having been in service with the Government, leading to an unchallenged second jury who heard and decided the case, was directly responsible for exposing extreme jury vetting, and eliciting official disclosures on the nature and previous extent of the practice - generally in the case of political or terrorist trials, or cases of organized crime. Increasing attention by libertarians to the nature of the jury system, and its preservation and strengthening, proved to be a lasting bonus of the case.Anna Coote, 'The Loyal Jury and the Foreman with Firm Opinions', New Statesman, 1978 The case indirectly raised questions of or helped to shape principles of UK law.

Formerly known as Smith-Ennismore-Lakefield, the township passed a by-law changing its name to Selwyn in 2012.\\"Smith-Ennismore-Lakefield Township to be renamed Selwyn Township\\". Peterborough Examiner, December 12, 2012. The change became official on January 15, 2013. Geography The township comprises the communities of: Bridgenorth, Chemong Heights, Chemong Park, Connaught Shore, Deer Bay, Emerald Isle, Ennismore, Fife's Bay, Flood's Landing, Fowlers Corners, Gannon Beach, Gannon Village, Kawartha Park, Kimberley Park, Lakefield, Selwyn, Selwyn Shores, Stewart Heights, Tera View Heights, Tindle Bay, Victoria Springs, Village Meadows, Windward Sands, Woodland Acres, Young's Cove, Young's Point and Youngstown. The township is 67 percent rural including small villages and hamlets, along with the urban areas of Lakefield, Bridgenorth - Chemong Park, and Woodland Acres (part of the urban area of Peterborough). Farms have been established on most of the flat areas, which are intermixed between the rolling hills and lakes. The Trent-Severn Waterway passes through the township. History On January 1, 1998, Ennismore and Smith Townships were merged to form the Township of Smith-Ennismore. On January 1, 2001, a Minister's Order created the township in its current form by amalgamating the formerly independent Village of Lakefield with the Township of Smith-Ennismore and part of Douro‚ÄìDummer Township. On December 11, 2012 the township council voted to select a new name after Canada Post notified many residents that addresses would have to be changed to reflect the municipality due to a phasing out of its rural route system. By a vote of 3 to 2, the township council voted to adopt the new name of Selwyn. Economy The region is in the heart of Ontario's eastern cottage country, where urban residents (mostly from the Toronto region) have cottages on many of the small lakes. Many of the retail and services offered in the region cater to this seasonal market. Small scale farms are a large industry, and dairy and meat production are some of the notable goods.

LDPS took over the building formerly used for the now closed Lakefield District Secondary School. St. Paul's Catholic School, which is situated very close to the high school, is the area parochial school. In fiction In Paul Nicholas Mason's novel Battered Soles (2005), Lakefield is the site of a pilgrimage, begun in July 1997, which sees thousands of pilgrims from all over the world walk from Peterborough along the Rotary Greenway Trail to St. John's Anglican Church in the village. The focus of the pilgrimage is a life-sized statue of a blue-skinned Jesus in the basement of the church.

Like the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor four years later, Japan and the United States were not at war at the time. The Japanese claimed that they did not see the US flags painted on the deck of the gunboat, apologized, and paid an indemnity. Nevertheless, the attack and the subsequent Allison incident in Nanking caused U.S. opinion to turn against the Japanese. Background A flat-bottomed craft built in Shanghai specifically for river duty, Panay served as part of the US Navy's Yangtze Patrol in the Asiatic Fleet, which was responsible for patrolling the Yangtze River to protect American lives and property in China. After invading China in the summer of 1937, Japanese forces moved into Nanking (now known as Nanjing) in December, where they later committed the massacre in the city that resulted in the deaths of 300,000 civilians and prisoners of war. Panay evacuated the remaining Americans from the city on December 11, bringing the number of people aboard to five officers, 54 enlisted men, four US embassy staff, and 10 civilians, including Universal Newsreel cameraman Norman Alley, Movietone News‚Äô Eric Mayell, the New York Times's Norman Soong, Collier's Weekly correspondent Jim Marshall, La Stampa correspondent Sandro Sandri and Corriere della Sera correspondent Luigi Barzini Jr. Woosung, China, on 30 August 1928. Incident On the morning of the 12th, the Japanese air forces received information that fleeing Chinese forces were in the area in ten large steamers and a large number of junks and that they were between upstream from Nanking. While anchored upstream from Nanking, Panay and three Standard Oil tankers, Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, came under attack from Japanese naval aircraft. Panay was hit by two of the eighteen bombs dropped by three Yokosuka B4Y Type-96 bombers and strafed by nine Nakajima A4N Type-95 fighters. According to Lieutenant J.W. Geist, an officer aboard the Panay, \\"the day before we told the Japanese army in the area who we were,\\" and three U.S. flags were plainly visible on the ship. Planes also machine-gunned small boats taking the wounded ashore, and several additional survivors were wounded. The Times correspondent Colin MacDonald, who had also been aboard the Panay, saw a Japanese army small boat machine-gun the Panay as it was sinking in spite of the American flag painted on the side of the ship. Since Japanese planes continued to circle overhead, survivors cowered knee deep in mud in a swamp.The Oregonian, Saturday, December 18, 1937. page 24. As a result of the attack, Panay sank; Storekeeper First Class Charles Lee Ensminger, Standard Oil tanker captain Carl H. Carlson and Italian reporter Sandro Sandri were killed, Coxswain Edgar C. Hulsebus died later that night. 43 sailors and five civilians were wounded. The three Standard Oil tankers were also bombed and destroyed, and the captain of Mei An and many Chinese civilian passengers were killed. The vessels had been helping to evacuate the families of Standard Oil's employees and agents from Nanking during the Japanese attack on that city.Mender, P., Thirty Years a Mariner in the Far East 1907‚Äì1937, The Memoirs of Peter Mender, a Standard Oil ship captain on China's Yangtze River, . Two newsreel cameramen were aboard during the attack (Norman Alley of Universal News and Eric Mayell of Movietone News); they were able to film part of the attack and, after reaching shore, the sinking of the ship in the middle of the river. Survivors were later taken aboard the American vessel and the British gunboats and . Earlier the same day, a Japanese shore battery had fired on Ladybird. The survivors coped with near freezing nights in inadequate clothing and with no food. It took three days to move the sixteen wounded to the safety of several British and American ships.Yangtze Patrol: The U.S. Navy in China. Kemp Tolley. Naval Institute Press, Mar 22, 2013 Diplomacy The aftermath of the Panay sinking was a nervous time for the American ambassador to Japan, Joseph C. Grew. Grew, whose experience in the foreign service spanned over 30 years, \\"remembered the Maine,\\" the U.S. Navy ship that blew up in Havana Harbor in 1898. The sinking of Maine had propelled the U.S. into the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and Grew hoped the sinking of Panay would not be a similar catalyst for the severance of diplomatic ties and war with Japan. The Japanese government took full responsibility for sinking Panay but continued to maintain that the attack had been unintentional. Chief of Staff of Japanese naval forces in northern China, Vice Admiral Rokuzo Sugiyama, was assigned to make an apology.Prados, John., Combined Fleet Decoded: The Secret History of American Intelligence and the Japanese Navy in World War II, , page 50. The formal apology reached Washington, D.C. on Christmas Eve. Although Japanese officials maintained that their pilots never saw any American flags on Panay, a US Navy court of inquiry determined that several US flags were clearly visible on the vessel during the attacks.http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi- bin/FRUS/FRUS- idx?type=turn&id;=FRUS.FRUS193141v01&entity;=FRUS.FRUS193141v01.p0638&q1;=japan 1931‚Äì1941. At the meeting held at the American embassy in Tokyo on December 23, Japanese officials maintained that one navy airplane had attacked a boat by machine gun for a short period of time and that Japanese army motor boats or launches attack the Chinese steamers escaping upstream on the opposite bank. However, the Japanese navy insisted that the attack had been unintentional. The Japanese government paid an indemnity of $2,214,007.36 to the US on April 22, 1938, officially settling the Panay incident.Japanese Pay U.S. 'In Full' Panay Incident Officially Closed with $2,214.007 Indemnity Settlement. Tokyo, April 22, 1938 Associated Press. Miami Daily News Record April 22, 1938 page 1 However, the presence of U.S. flags, which would have been visible from the air,https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17110447 suggests the attack had not been a mistake, but rather a type of unauthorized action. On the other hand, in japanese testimony, Kaname Harada, a member of the attack team, wrote that Panay did not display U.S. flags anywhere. Universal Newsreel about the incident, 12 December 1937. Post-incident From the beginning, the State Department's position was that none of the families of those killed or the sailors or civilians wounded would receive any of the contributions. No office or department of the federal government would accept the money. The State Department also expressed the desire that any necessary arrangements be made promptly. Hull did not wish to keep the Japanese people waiting for a decision on what was to become of the money they donated. A prolonged delay could lead to misunderstanding, especially if a decision was reached months later to return the money to the donors. The State Department telegram of 18 December also set forth, at least for the time being, that only the American ambassador in Japan and the American ambassador in China could accept donations related to the Panay incident. Several American consulates were receiving money, including consulates at Nagoya, Kobe, Nagasaki and Osaka, in Japan; Taipei, Taiwan; Keijo (Seoul), Korea; Dairen, Manchuria; and S√£o Paulo, Brazil. These contributions were eventually forwarded to the ambassador in Tokyo. Grew kept all money received related to the Panay incident in the embassy safe until the State Department could find a solution. The American consulates in Nagasaki forwarded several contributions and translations of letters to the embassy in Tokyo, including ¬•50 from a Mr. Ichiro Murakami, identified as a former U.S. Navy pensioner, and another individual who wished to remain anonymous. The Navy Cross was presented subsequently to two British naval officers, Vice Admiral Lewis Eyre Crabbe and Lieut. Commander Harry Barlow, for their \\"voluntary and unstinted cooperation in assisting with the recovery of the survivors of the U.S.S. Panay.http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=17057 Other letters In a letter two days later, the consulate in Nagasaki also reported to Grew that on 21 December a small boy from the Shin Kozen Primary School brought in a letter and donation of ¬•2 to the consulate and was accompanied by his older brother. The consul enclosed the contribution and both the original and translation of the boy's letter. The letter reads, \\"The cold has come. Having heard from my elder brother that the American warship has sunk the other day I feel very sorry. Having been committed without intention beyond doubt, I apologize on behalf of the soldiers. Please forgive. Here is the money I saved. Please hand it to the American sailors injured.\\" The letter, addressed \\"To the American sailors,\\" was signed only, \\"One of the pupils of the Shin Kozen.\\" The boy did not provide his name in the letter and did not reveal it when visiting the consulate. A local newspaper, the Nagasaki Minyu Shimbun, published the story of Murakami's donation and that of the schoolboy and included an excerpt of the boy's letter. Arthur F. Tower, the American consul in Nagasaki, informed Ambassador Grew of the article, which had been published on 7 January. Tower also informed Grew that a reporter of another newspaper‚Äîthe Tokyo and Osaka Asahi Shimbun, had called on him on 23 December to discuss the Panay contributions. Towers reassured Grew that \\"this consulate has not sought to give publicity to the donations received or offered and has furnished information concerning them on two occasions only, when requested.\\" Pensioners Although the consul in Nagasaki was not trying to publicize the donations, the newspaper stories may have increased contributions at his consulate. On 8 January, a Japanese pensioner of the US Navy called in person to make a contribution of ¬•5 for the relief of those involved in the Panay incident. When his contribution was accepted, the former sailor informed the consul that a group of other US pensioners also wished to donate money. On 10 January, he visited the consulate again, this time with two representatives of Japanese pensioners of the US Navy who lived in the area. By this time, however, the Nagasaki consulate had received the consulate general's supervisory circular informing them that all Panay-related contributions were to be made either to the ambassador in China or the ambassador in Japan. The gentlemen attempted to donate money but were informed that the consul could no longer receive contributions, and the men were asked to communicate directly with the American embassy in Tokyo. Soon after the departure of the former US sailors, two Japanese men arrived at the consulate. These gentlemen, representing the Buddhist Association of Nagasaki, also had come to donate money for victims of Panay and were likewise turned away.Based on public domain material from Prologue Magazine Responsibility for the attack Modern historians believe that the attack may have been intentional. According to John Prados, Navy cryptographers had intercepted and decrypted traffic relating to the attacking planes which clearly indicated that they were under orders during the attack and that it had not been a mistake of any kind. This information was not released at the time for obvious secrecy reasons. Writer Nick Sparks believes that the chaos in Nanking created an opportunity for renegade factions within the Japanese army who wanted to force the U.S. into an active conflict so that the Japanese could once and for all drive the U.S. out of China.NPR: A Japanese Attack Before Pearl Harbor Legacy Fon Huffman, the last survivor of the incident, died in 2008. The last surviving Japanese pilot who participated in the attack was Kaname Harada,http://www.historicalconsulting.com/last_zero_fighter.html who died in 2016. The episode has been cited by Philip K. Dick in his novel The Man in the High Castle, depicted in a collectible picture-card of the 1940s, in the series Horrors of War with the title \\"The sinking of the Panay.\\" The incident features in the novel A Winter in China by the British writer Douglas Galbraith. It is also described in the historical fiction novel Pearl Harbor by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen. The Panay incident is an important part of the background in Own Sela's thriller \\"An Exchange of Eagles\\". In the book, the only son of Max Schroeder, a Military Intelligence Colonel, was killed on board the Panay. Shroeder nurses a deep grudge against President Roosevelt, whom he considers to have sent his son to die in vain. That makes Schroeder willing, in 1940, to contemplate assassinating Roosevelt in order to prevent American soldiers being sent to die in Europe. The 2009 film John Rabe portrays a fictionalized version of the incident. Matt Zullo's 2020 novel \\"The U.S Navy's On-the-Roof Gang, Vol. 1\\" carries the narrative of the Navy intercept operators in Hawaii who followed Japanese communications before and during the attack.

Rawkus started in 1995 with releases in hip-hop, drum and bass and fun-dustrial (Dystopia One). Label heads Brian Brater and Jarret Myer then signed some of the top underground talent from the New York area, notably Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Hi-Tek and Company Flow, who went on to define the label's sound. The string of 12\\" releases and full-length albums that followed helped initiate a resurgence in the New York/East Coast sound. Many of these are considered classics among hip-hop aficionados. During the mid to late 1990s, Rawkus became a dominant label in the underground hip-hop scene, producing a string of gold albums and a platinum album. History Rawkus Records was established in 1995 by Brian Brater and Jarret Myer, with financial backing from their High School buddy James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch. In 1996, Rupert Murdoch bought a majority of Rawkus. In 1999 the label entered into a distribution deal with Priority Records. Over the years, Rawkus recorded several notable independent hip hop artists, including Reflection Eternal, Company Flow, the High and Mighty, Mos Def and Talib Kweli (as Blackstar), Eminem, Common, Pharoahe Monch and Skillz. In 2002, Rawkus signed a joint venture deal with MCA. Soon after, MCA folded and Interscope/Geffen bought Rawkus. After the sale of its catalog in 2004, Rawkus split from Geffen. In 2006, Rawkus signed with RED, a Sony Music distribution company and reemerged with a new line up of notable independent hip hop artists. In early 2007, Rawkus Records accepted album submissions from Hip Hop artists, known or unknown, to be considered for their new campaign. The 50 artists chosen to wear the Rawkus 50 badge were signed to a digital distribution deal through IODA's (Independent Online Distribution Alliance) digital distribution network and had their albums released under the banner \\"Rawkus 50 presents\\". Among the 50 were artists including Custom Made, L.E.G.A.C.Y. and Pizon.

Hamelin is recognized worldwide for the originality and technical proficiency of his performances of the classic repertoire. He has received 11 Grammy Award nominations. Biography Born in Montreal, Quebec, Hamelin began his piano studies at the age of five. His father, a pharmacist by trade who was also an amateur pianist, introduced him to the works of Alkan, Godowsky, and Sorabji when he was still young. He studied at the √âcole de musique Vincent-d'Indy in Montreal with Yvonne Hubert 88 notes pour piano solo, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Neva Ed., 2015, p.54. and then at Temple University in Philadelphia. In 1989 he was awarded the Virginia Parker Prize.Canada Council. The Virginia Parker Prize Cumulative list of Winners Hamelin has given recitals in many cities.

He plays annually in the Herkulessaal in Munich and has given a series of recitals in Tokyo. Hamelin has made recordings of a wide variety of composers with the Hyperion label. His recording of Leopold Godowsky's complete Studies on Chopin's √âtudes won the 2000 Gramophone Magazine Instrumental Award. He is well known for his attention to lesser- known composers especially of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century (Max Reger, Leo Ornstein, Nikolai Roslavets, Georgy Catoire), and for performing works by the pianist-composers Sophie-Carmen Eckhardt-Gramatt√©, Leopold Godowsky, Charles-Valentin Alkan, Kaikhosru Sorabji, Nikolai Kapustin, Franz Liszt, Nikolai Medtner and Frederic Rzewski. Hamelin has also composed several works, including a set of piano √©tudes in all of the minor keys, which was completed in September 2009 and is published by C. F. Peters, with a recording released on the Hyperion label. A cycle of seven pieces, called Con Intimissimo Sentimento, was published (with a recording by Hamelin) by Ongaku No Tomo Sha; and a transcription of Zequinha de Abreu's Tico-Tico No Fub√° has been published by Schott Music. Although the majority of his compositions are for piano solo, he has also written three pieces for player piano (including the comical Circus Galop and Solfeggietto a cinque, which is based on a theme by C.P.E. Bach), and several works for other forces, including Fanfares for three trumpets, published by Presser. His other works are distributed by the Sorabji Archive.

Biography Born in Findlay, Ohio, Bennett attended Carnegie Institute of Technology from 1920 to 1922 and Ohio State University; the University of Wisconsin, Sc.M. in physical chemistry, 1926; and the University of Michigan, Ph.D. in physics, 1928. Bennett was elected to a National Research Fellowship in Physics and in 1928 and 1929 studied at the California Institute of Technology. In 1930 he joined the Physics faculty at Ohio State. During the World War II era, he served as an officer in the United States Army and developed aircraft equipment. Following military service, Bennett worked at the National Bureau of Standards, the University of Arkansas, and the United States Naval Research Laboratory. In 1961, he was appointed Burlington Professor of Physics at North Carolina State University (emeritus in 1976). Bennett held 67 patents. Bennett made scientific history in the 1930s pioneering studies in plasma physics, the study of gases ionized by high-voltage electricity. Bennett invented radio frequency mass spectrometry in (1955). Bennett's radio-frequency mass spectrometer measured the masses of atoms. It was the first such experiment in space. He also researched gases ionized by high-voltage electricity. This research was used in later thermonuclear fusion research. Invention impact These studies and later research have been used throughout the world in controlled thermonuclear fusion research. In the 1950s, Bennett's experimental tube called the Stormertron predicted and modeled the Van Allen radiation belts surrounding the earth six years before they were discovered by satellite. It also reproduced intricate impact patterns found on the Earth's surface which explained many features of the polar aurora. Sputnik 3 carried the first radio frequency mass spectrometer into space.

Portrait by √âdouard Dubufe Charles-Valentin Alkan (; 30 November 1813 ‚Äì 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eug√®ne Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions ‚Äì virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4‚Äì7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8‚Äì10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son √âlie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase), Alkan's music became neglected, supported by only a few musicians including Ferruccio Busoni, Egon Petri and Kaikhosru Sorabji. From the late 1960s onwards, led by Raymond Lewenthal and Ronald Smith, many pianists have recorded his music and brought it back into the repertoire. Life=Family Alkan's father, Alkan MorhangeAlkan was born Charles-Valentin Morhange on 30 November 1813 at 1, Rue de Braque in Paris to Alkan Morhange (1780‚Äì1855) and Julie Morhange, n√©e Abraham.Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 86. Alkan Morhange was descended from a long-established Jewish Ashkenazic community in the region of Metz;Blamont and Blamont (2005), 3‚Äì8. the village of Morhange is located about from the city of Metz. Charles-Valentin was the second of six children ‚Äì one elder sister and four younger brothers; his birth certificate indicates that he was named after a neighbour who witnessed the birth.Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 303‚Äì5. Alkan Morhange supported the family as a musician and later as the proprietor of a private music school in le Marais, the Jewish quarter of Paris.Conway (2012), 222‚Äì5. At an early age, Charles-Valentin and his siblings adopted their father's first name as their last (and were known by this during their studies at the Conservatoire de Paris and subsequent careers). His brother Napol√©on (1826‚Äì1906) became professor of solf√®ge at the Conservatoire, his brother Maxim (1818‚Äì1897) had a career writing light music for Parisian theatres, and his sister, C√©leste (1812‚Äì1897), was a singer.Smith (2000) I, 16. His brother Ernest (1816‚Äì1876) was a professional flautist,Starr (2003), 6. while the youngest brother Gustave (1827‚Äì1882) was to publish various dances for the piano.Francois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 88. Prodigy (1819‚Äì1831) Report on Alkan's 1819 solf√®ge audition at the Paris Conservatoire. (Archives Nationales, Paris) Report on Alkan's 1820 keyboard audition at the Paris Conservatoire. (Archives Nationales, Paris) Alkan was a child prodigy.Conway (2012), 224. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris at an unusually early age, and studied both piano and organ. The records of his auditions survive in the Archives Nationales in Paris. At his solf√®ge audition on 3 July 1819, when he was just over 5 years 7 months, the examiners noted Alkan (who is referred to even at this early date as \\"Alkan (Valentin)\\", and whose age is given incorrectly as six-and-a-half) as \\"having a pretty little voice\\". The profession of Alkan Morhange is given as \\"music-paper ruler\\". At Charles-Valentin's piano audition on 6 October 1820, when he was nearly seven (and where he is named as \\"Alkan (Morhange) Valentin\\"), the examiners comment \\"This child has amazing abilities.\\"Conway (2012), 222‚Äì223. Alkan became a favourite of his teacher at the Conservatoire, Joseph Zimmerman, who also taught Georges Bizet, C√©sar Franck, Charles Gounod, and Ambroise Thomas.Smith (2000) I, 17. At the age of seven, Alkan won a first prize for solf√®ge and in later years prizes in piano (1824), harmony (1827, as student of Victor Dourlen), and organ (1834).Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 14. At the age of seven- and-a-half he gave his first public performance, appearing as a violinist and playing an air and variations by Pierre Rode.Eddie (2007), 2. Alkan's Opus 1, a set of variations for piano based on a theme by Daniel Steibelt, dates from 1828, when he was 14 years old. At about this time he also undertook teaching duties at his father's school. Antoine Marmontel, one of Charles-Valentin's pupils there, who was later to become his b√™te noire, wrote of the school: > Young children, mostly Jewish, were given elementary musical instruction and > also learnt the first rudiments of French grammar ... [There] I received a > few lessons from the young Alkan, four years my senior ... I see once more > ... that really parochial environment where the talent of Valentin Alkan was > formed and where his hard-working youth blossomed ... It was like a > preparatory school, a juvenile annexe of the Conservatoire.Marmontel (1878), > 119‚Äì20 (in French); translation in Conway (2012), 224‚Äì5. From about 1826 Alkan began to appear as a piano soloist in leading Parisian salons, including those of the Princesse de la Moskova (widow of Marshal Ney), and the Duchesse de Montebello. He was probably introduced to these venues by his teacher Zimmerman.Francois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 88‚Äì9. At the same time, Alkan Morhange arranged concerts featuring Charles-Valentin at public venues in Paris, in association with leading musicians including the sopranos Giuditta Pasta and Henriette Sontag, the cellist Auguste Franchomme and the violinist Lambert Massart, with whom Alkan gave concerts in a rare visit out of France to Brussels in 1827.Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 91‚Äì2. In 1829, at the age of 15, Alkan was appointed joint professor of solf√®ge ‚Äì among his pupils in this class a few years later was his brother Napol√©on. In this manner Alkan's musical career was launched well before the July Revolution of 1830, which initiated a period in which \\"keyboard virtuosity ... completely dominated professional music making\\" in the capital,Rink (1997), 1. attracting from all over Europe pianists who, as Heinrich Heine wrote, invaded \\"like a plague of locusts swarming to pick Paris clean\\".Cited in Walker (1989), 163. Alkan nonetheless continued his studies and in 1831 enrolled in the organ classes of Fran√ßois Benoist, from whom he may have learnt to appreciate the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, of whom Benoist was then one of the few French advocates.Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 95. Early fame (1831‚Äì1837) George Sand at 34, by Auguste Charpentier (1838) The Square d'Orl√©ans Antoine MarmontelThroughout the early years of the July Monarchy, Alkan continued to teach and play at public concerts and in eminent social circles. He became a friend of many who were active in the world of the arts in Paris, including Franz Liszt (who had been based there since 1827), George Sand, and Victor Hugo. It is not clear exactly when he first met Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, who arrived in Paris in September 1831.Kennedy, Michael (ed.), \\"Fryderyk Chopin\\", The Oxford Dictionary of Music online, accessed 19 July 2013. In 1832 Alkan took the solo role in his first Concerto da camera for piano and strings at the Conservatoire. In the same year, aged 19, he was elected to the influential Soci√©t√© Acad√©mique des Enfants d'Apollon (Society of the Children of Apollo), whose members included Luigi Cherubini, Fromental Hal√©vy, the conductor Fran√ßois Habeneck, and Liszt, who had been elected in 1824 at the age of twelve. Between 1833 and 1836 Alkan participated at many of the Society's concerts.Eddie (2007), 6.Walker (1989), 96. Alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome, in 1832 and again in 1834; the cantatas which he wrote for the competition, Hermann et Ketty and L'Entr√©e en loge, have remained unpublished and unperformed.Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 97, 102. In 1834 Alkan began his friendship with the Spanish musician Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came to light in 2009.Conway (2010), 2‚Äì3. The correspondence is in the Spanish Historical Archives ‚Äì see 'Sources', below. Like virtually all of Alkan's correspondence, this exchange is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will,Luguenot (1997), 26. or became lost after his death.Smith (2000) I, 83‚Äì5 Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second Concerto da camera was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field;Smith (2000) I, 22. it was published in London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to MasarnauLetter to Masarnau of 18/19 August 1835. Sanjurjo collection, Spanish Historical Archives. and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, indicate that he returned to England in 1835. Later that year, Alkan, having found a place of retreat at Piscop outside Paris, completed his first truly original works for solo piano, the Twelve Caprices, published in 1837 as Opp. 12, 13, 15 and 16.Conway (2013b), 4‚Äì5. Op. 16, the Trois scherzi de bravoure, is dedicated to Masarnau. In January 1836, Liszt recommended Alkan for the post of Professor at the Geneva Conservatoire, which Alkan declined,Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 106. and in 1837 he wrote an enthusiastic review of Alkan's Op. 15 Caprices in the Revue et gazette musicale.Revue et gazette musicale, October 1837, 460‚Äì461 (in French). Reprinted as: Franz Liszt, \\"Revue critique: Trois morceaux dans le genre path√©tique par C.-V. Alkan: Oeuvre 15, 3. livre des 12 caprices\\", Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Alkan no. 8 (19 April 1988), 5‚Äì7, accessed 6 May 2013. At the Square d'Orl√©ans (1837‚Äì1848) From 1837, Alkan lived in the Square d'Orl√©ans in Paris, which was inhabited by numerous celebrities of the time including Marie Taglioni, Alexandre Dumas, George Sand, and Chopin.Fran√ßois- Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 110. Chopin and Alkan were personal friends and often discussed musical topics, including a work on musical theory that Chopin proposed to write.Conway (2012), 229‚Äì30. By 1838, at 25 years old, Alkan had reached a peak of his career.Conway (2012), 225-7. He frequently gave recitals, his more mature works had begun to be published, and he often appeared in concerts with Liszt and Chopin. On 23 April 1837 Alkan took part in Liszt's farewell concert in Paris, together with the 14-year-old C√©sar Franck and the virtuoso Johann Peter Pixis.Williams (1990), 91; Conway (2012), 226. On 3 March 1838, at a concert at the piano-maker Pape, Alkan played with Chopin, Zimmerman, and Chopin's pupil Adolphe Gutmann in a performance of Alkan's transcription, now lost, of two movements of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony for two pianos, eight hands.Conway (2012), 226 and n. 9 At this point, for a period which coincided with the birth and childhood of his natural son, √âlie-Miriam Delaborde (1839‚Äì1913), Alkan withdrew into private study and composition for six years, returning to the concert platform only in 1844.Smith (2000) I, 31‚Äì2. Alkan neither asserted nor denied his paternity of Delaborde, which, however, his contemporaries seemed to assume.Smith (2000) I, 27. Marmontel wrote cryptically in a biography of Delaborde that \\"[his] birth is a page from a novel in the life of a great artist\\".Marmontel (1882), 158. Alkan gave early piano lessons to Delaborde, who was to follow his natural father as a keyboard virtuoso.Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 52‚Äì3. Alkan's return to the concert platform in 1844 was greeted with enthusiasm by critics, who noted the \\"admirable perfection\\" of his technique, and lauded him as \\"a model of science and inspiration\\", a \\"sensation\\" and an \\"explosion\\".Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 31‚Äì3. They also commented on the attending celebrities including Liszt, Chopin, Sand and Dumas. In the same year he published his piano √©tude Le chemin de fer, which critics, following Ronald Smith, believe to be the first representation in music of a steam engine.Smith (2000) II, 157. Between 1844 and 1848 Alkan produced a series of virtuoso pieces, the 25 Pr√©ludes Op. 31 for piano or organ, and the sonata Op. 33 Les quatre √¢ges.Smith (2000) II, 261‚Äì2. Following an Alkan recital in 1848, the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer was so impressed that he invited the pianist, whom he considered \\"a most remarkable artist\\", to prepare the piano arrangement of the overture to his forthcoming opera, Le proph√®te. Meyerbeer heard and approved Alkan's arrangement of the overture for four hands (which Alkan played with his brother Napol√©on) in 1849; published in 1850, it is the only record of the overture, which was scrapped during rehearsals at the Op√©ra.Conway (2012), 229, which cites (n. 102) and translates relevant extracts from Meyerbeer (1960‚Äì2006). Retreat (1848‚Äì1872) In 1848 Alkan was bitterly disappointed when the head of the Conservatoire, Daniel Auber, replaced the retiring Zimmerman with the mediocre Marmontel as head of the Conservatoire piano department, a position which Alkan had eagerly anticipated, and for which he had strongly lobbied with the support of Sand, Dumas, and many other leading figures.Smith (2000) I, 42‚Äì45. A disgusted Alkan described the appointment in a letter to Sand as \\"the most incredible, the most shameful nomination\\";Letter of 14 August 1848; Luguenot and Saint-G√©rand (1992), 22 (translated from original French). and Delacroix noted in his journal: \\"By his confrontation with Auber, [Alkan] has been very put out and will doubtless continue to be so.\\"Entry of 7 April 1849, cited in Conway (2012), 229. The upset arising from this incident may account for Alkan's reluctance to perform in public in the ensuing period. His withdrawal was also influenced by the death of Chopin; in 1850 he wrote to Masarnau \\"I have lost the strength to be of any economic or political use\\", and lamented \\"the death of poor Chopin, another blow which I felt deeply.\\"Letter to Masarnau of 29 March 1850, Sanjurjo Collection, Spanish National Historical Archives (translated from original French). Chopin, on his deathbed in 1849, had indicated his respect for Alkan by bequeathing him his unfinished work on a piano method, intending him to complete it, and after Chopin's death a number of his students transferred to Alkan.Marmontel (1878), 122; Smith (2000) I, 48. After giving two concerts in 1853, Alkan withdrew, in spite of his fame and technical accomplishment, into virtual seclusion for some twenty years.Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 135‚Äì7. Little is known of this period of Alkan's life, other than that apart from composing he was immersed in the study of the Bible and the Talmud. Throughout this period Alkan continued his correspondence with Ferdinand Hiller,Now in the archives at Cologne; selection published in Hiller (1958‚Äì70). whom he had probably met in Paris in the 1830s,Espagne (1996), 97. and with Masarnau, from which some insights can be gained. It appears that Alkan completed a full translation into French, now lost, of both the Old Testament and the New Testament, from their original languages.Smith (2000) I, 54 In 1865, he wrote to Hiller: \\"Having translated a good deal of the Apocrypha, I'm now onto the second Gospel which I am translating from the Syriac ... In starting to translate the New Testament, I was suddenly struck by a singular idea ‚Äì that you have to be Jewish to be able to do it.\\"Letter of May 1865, cited in Conway (2012), 231. Despite his seclusion from society, this period saw the composition and publication of many of Alkan's major piano works, including the Douze √©tudes dans tous les tons mineurs, Op. 39 (1857), the Sonatine, Op. 61 (1861), the 49 Esquisses, Op. 63 (1861), and the five collections of Chants (1857‚Äì1872), as well as the Sonate de concert for cello and piano, Op. 47 (1856). These did not pass unremarked; Hans von B√ºlow, for example, gave a laudatory review of the Op. 35 √âtudes in the Neue Berliner Musikzeitung in 1857, the year in which they were published in Berlin, commenting that \\"Alkan is unquestionably the most eminent representative of the modern piano school at Paris. The virtuoso's disinclination to travel, and his firm reputation as a teacher, explain why, at present, so little attention has been given to his work in Germany.\\"von B√ºlow, Hans, \\"C. V. Alkan: Douze √©tudes pour le piano en deux suites op. 35\\", Neue Berliner Musikzeitung vol. 11 no. 35, 26 August 1857 (in German). Reprinted in French translation: \\"Le jugement d'un contemporain\\", Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Alkan no. 6, November 1987, 3‚Äì12, accessed 4 July 2013. From the early 1850s Alkan began to turn his attention seriously to the pedal piano (p√©dalier). Alkan gave his first public performances on the p√©dalier to great critical acclaim in 1852.Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013) 58‚Äì59. From 1859 onwards he began to publish pieces designated as \\"for organ or piano √† p√©dalier\\".Smith (2000) II, 221‚Äì3. Reappearance (1873‚Äì1888) Mus√©e de la Musique, Paris It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the √ârard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire.Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 133‚Äì4. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond.Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 137‚Äì8. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the p√©dalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, and Auguste Franchomme.Smith (2000) I, 66‚Äì7. Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an √ârard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ... I couldn't begin to describe ‚Äì above all in the Arioso and the Fugue, where the melody, penetrating the mystery of Death itself, climbs up to a blaze of light, affected me with an excess of enthusiasm such as I have never experienced since. This was not Liszt‚Äîperhaps less perfect, technically‚Äîbut it had greater intimacy and was more humanly moving...\\"Cited in Smith (2000) I, 101. The biographer of Chopin, Frederick Niecks, sought Alkan for his recollections in 1880 but was sternly denied access by Alkan's concierge ‚Äì \\"To my ... enquiry when he could be found at home, the reply was a ... decisive 'Never'.\\" However, a few days later he found Alkan at √ârard's, and Niecks writes of their meeting that \\"his reception of me was not merely polite but most friendly.\\"Smith (2000) I, 70‚Äì1. Death Tomb of Charles-Valentin Alkan, Montmartre Cemetery, Paris According to his death certificate, Alkan died in Paris on 29 March 1888 at the age of 74.Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 310. Alkan was buried on 1 April (Easter Sunday) in the Jewish section of Montmartre Cemetery, Paris,Smith (2000) I, 75. not far from the tomb of his contemporary Fromental Hal√©vy; his sister C√©leste was later buried in the same tomb.Conway (2012), 237. For many years it was believed that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him as he reached for a volume of the Talmud from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist Isidor Philipp,Smith (2000) I, 74. is dismissed by Hugh Macdonald, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that Alkan had been found prostrate in his kitchen, under a porte-parapluie (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his moaning. He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening.Macdonald (1988), 118‚Äì20. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan's family originated.Conway (2012), 230; Ellef, Zev, \\"The Wages of Criticism\\", Jewish Review of Books, no.8, accessed 23 May 2013. Personality One of only two known photographs of AlkanAlkan was described by Marmontel (who refers to \\"a regrettable misunderstanding at a moment of our careers in 1848\\"), as follows: > We will not give the portrait of Valentin Alkan from the rear, as in some > photographs we have seen. His intelligent and original physiognomy deserves > to be taken in profile or head-on. The head is strong; the deep forehead is > that of a thinker; the mouth large and smiling, the nose regular; the years > have whitened the beard and hair ... the gaze fine, a little mocking. His > stooped walk, his puritan comportment, give him the look of an Anglican > minister or a rabbi ‚Äì for which he has the abilities.Marmontel (1878), 125‚Äì6 > (in French), translated in Conway (2012), 231. Alkan was not always remote or aloof. Chopin describes, in a letter to friend, visiting the theatre with Alkan in 1847 to see the comedian Arnal: \\"[Arnal] tells the audience how he was desperate to pee in a train, but couldn't get to a toilet before they stopped at Orl√©ans. There wasn't a single vulgar word in what he said, but everyone understood and split their sides laughing.\\"Cited in Attwood (1999), 270. Hugh Macdonald notes that Alkan \\"particularly enjoyed the patronage of Russian aristocratic ladies, 'des dames tr√®s parfum√©es et froufroutantes [highly perfumed and frilled ladies]', as Isidore Philipp described them.\\"Macdonald, Hugh, \\"Alkan [Morhange], (Charles-)Valentin\\" ¬ß1, Oxford Music Online, accessed 26 July 2013. Alkan's aversion to socialising and publicity, especially following 1850, appeared to be self-willed. Liszt is reported to have commented to the Danish pianist Frits Hartvigson that \\"Alkan possessed the finest technique he had ever known, but preferred the life of a recluse.\\"Smith (2000) I, 95 Stephanie McCallum has suggested that Alkan may have suffered from Asperger syndrome, schizophrenia or obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder.McCallum, S. (2007), 2‚Äì10. Alkan's later correspondence contains many despairing comments. In a letter of about 1861 he wrote to Hiller: > I'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous ... nothing > worthwhile, good or useful to do ... no one to devote myself to. My > situation makes me horridly sad and wretched. Even musical production has > lost its attraction for me for I can't see the point or goal.\\"Sietz > (1958‚Äì70), v. 2, 15‚Äì16 (translated from original French). This spirit of anomie may have led him to reject requests in the 1860s to play in public, or to allow performances of his orchestral compositions.Smith (2000) I, 57. However, it should not be ignored that he was writing similarly frantic self-analyses in his letters of the early 1830s to Masarnau.\\"Alkan/Masarnau: d√©but de la correspondance\\", Alkan Society Bulletin no. 88, December 2012, 6-12, accessed 4 July 2013; Conway (2013b), 4-10. Hugh MacDonald writes that \\"Alkan's enigmatic character is reflected in his music ‚Äì he dressed in a severe, old-fashioned, somewhat clerical manner ‚Äì only in black ‚Äì discouraged visitors and went out rarely ‚Äì he had few friends ‚Äì was nervous in public and was pathologically worried about his health, even though it was good\\". Ronald Smith writes that \\"Alkan's characteristics, exacerbated no doubt by his isolation, are carried to the edge of fanaticism, and at the heart of Alkan's creativity there is also fierce obsessional control; his obsession with a specific idea can border on the pathological.\\"Burstein (2006) Jack Gibbons writes of Alkan's personality: \\"Alkan was an intelligent, lively, humorous and warm person (all characteristics which feature strongly in his music) whose only crime seems to have been having a vivid imagination, and whose occasional eccentricities (mild when compared with the behaviour of other 'highly-strung' artistes!) stemmed mainly from his hypersensitive nature.\\"Gibbons, Jack, The Myths of Alkan, Jack Gibbons Pianist and Composer, 2002, accessed 27 January 2012. Macdonald, however, suggests that \\"Alkan was a man of profoundly conservative ideas, whose lifestyle, manner of dress, and belief in the traditions of historic music, set him apart from other musicians and the world at large.\\"Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 129 (translated from the French). Judaism The Synagogue de Nazareth in Paris, where Alkan briefly held the post of organistAlkan grew up in a religiously observant Jewish household. His grandfather Marix Morhange had been a printer of the Talmud in Metz, and was probably a melamed (Hebrew teacher) in the Jewish congregation at Paris.Conway (2012), 207; Conway (2003a), 12; Conway (2003b), 2. Alkan's widespread reputation as a student of the Old Testament and religion, and the high quality of his Hebrew handwritingKessous Dreyfuss (2013), 70. testify to his knowledge of the religion, and many of his habits indicate that he practised at least some of its obligations, such as maintaining the laws of kashrut.See McCallum (2007), 8, and n. 11. Alkan was regarded by the Paris Consistory, the central Jewish organisation of the city, as an authority on Jewish music. In 1845 he assisted the Consistory in evaluating the musical ability of Samuel Naumbourg, who was subsequently appointed as hazzan (cantor) of the main Paris synagogue;Conway (2012), 219. and he later contributed choral pieces in each of Naumbourg's collections of synagogue music (1847 and 1856).Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 132‚Äì3. Alkan was appointed organist at the Synagogue de Nazareth in 1851, although he resigned the post almost immediately for \\"artistic reasons\\".Conway (2012), 234. Alkan's Op. 31 set of Pr√©ludes includes a number of pieces based on Jewish subjects, including some titled Pri√®re (Prayer), one preceded by a quote from the Song of Songs, and another titled Ancienne m√©lodie de la synagogue (Old synagogue melody).Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 286. The collection is believed to be \\"the first publication of art music specifically to deploy Jewish themes and ideas.\\"Conway (2012), 235‚Äì6. Alkan's three settings of synagogue melodies, prepared for his former pupil Zina de Mansouroff, are further examples of his interest in Jewish music; Kessous Dreyfuss provides a detailed analysis of these works and their origins.Kessous Dreyfuss (2013), 47‚Äì173. Other works evidencing this interest include no. 7 of his Op. 66\\\\. 11 Grands pr√©ludes et 1 Transcription (1866), entitled \\"Alla giudesca\\" and marked \\"con divozione\\", a parody of excessive hazzanic practice;Conway (2012), 235 and the slow movement of the cello sonata Op. 47 (1857), which is prefaced by a quotation from the Old Testament prophet Micah and uses melodic tropes derived from the cantillation of the haftarah in the synagogue. The inventory of Alkan's apartment made after his death indicates over 75 volumes in Hebrew or related to Judaism, left to his brother Napol√©on (as well as 36 volumes of music manuscript).Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 315. These are all lost.Smith (2000) I, 84‚Äì5. Bequests in his will to the Conservatoire to found prizes for composition of cantatas on Old Testament themes and for performance on the pedal-piano, and to a Jewish charity for the training of apprentices, were refused by the beneficiaries.Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 318‚Äì20. Music=Influences Hector Berlioz Brigitte Fran√ßois-Sappey points out the frequency with which Alkan has been compared to Berlioz, both by his contemporaries and later. She mentions that Hans von B√ºlow called him \\"the Berlioz of the piano\\", while Schumann, in criticising the Op. 15 Romances, claimed that Alkan merely \\"imitated Berlioz on the piano.\\" She further notes that Ferruccio Busoni repeated the comparison with Berlioz in a draft (but unpublished) monograph, while Kaikhosru Sorabji commented that Alkan's Op. 61 Sonatine was like \\"a Beethoven sonata written by Berlioz\\".Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 5. Berlioz was ten years older than Alkan, but did not attend the Conservatoire until 1826. The two were acquainted, and were perhaps both influenced by the unusual ideas and style of Anton Reicha who taught at the Conservatoire from 1818 to 1836, and by the sonorities of the composers of the period of the French Revolution.Conway (2012), 205. They both created individual, indeed, idiosyncratic sound-worlds in their music; there are, however, major differences between them. Alkan, unlike Berlioz, remained closely dedicated to the German musical tradition; his style and composition were heavily determined by his pianism, whereas Berlioz could hardly play at the keyboard and wrote nothing for piano solo. Alkan's works therefore also include miniatures and (among his early works) salon music, genres which Berlioz avoided.Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 8‚Äì9; Conway (2013a), 2. Alkan's attachment to the music of his predecessors is demonstrated throughout his career, from his arrangements for keyboard of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony (1838), and of the minuet of Mozart's 40th Symphony (1844), through the sets Souvenirs des concerts du Conservatoire (1847 and 1861) and the set Souvenirs de musique de chambre (1862), which include transcriptions of music by Mozart, Beethoven, J. S. Bach, Haydn, Gluck, and others.Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 293‚Äì4. In this context should be mentioned Alkan's extensive cadenza for Beethoven's 3rd Piano Concerto (1860), which includes quotes from the finale of Beethoven's 5th Symphony.Smith (2000) II, 178‚Äì181. Alkan's transcriptions, together with original music of Bach, Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Couperin and Rameau, were frequently played during the series of Petits Concerts given by Alkan at Erard.Smith (2000) I, 62‚Äì67. As regards the music of his own time, Alkan was unenthusiastic, or at any rate detached. He commented to Hiller that \\"Wagner is not a musician, he is a disease.\\"Letter to Hiller of 31 January 1860, cited in Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 198 (here translated from original French). While he admired Berlioz's talent, he did not enjoy his music.Smith (2000) I, 54‚Äì5. At the Petits Concerts, little more recent than Mendelssohn and Chopin (both of whom had died around 25 years before the series of concerts was initiated) was played, except for Alkan's own works and occasionally some by his favourites such as Saint-Sa√´ns.Smith (2000) I, 62, 66. Style Extract from the second movement of the sonata Les quatre √¢ges Op. 33, displaying one of Alkan's most complex musical textures \\"Like ... Chopin\\", writes pianist and academic Kenneth Hamilton, \\"Alkan's musical output was centred almost exclusively on the piano\\".Hamilton, Kenneth, \\"Alkan, (Charles-)Valentin[Valentin Morhange\\"], Oxford Companion to Music online, accessed 20 July 2013. Some of his music requires extreme technical virtuosity, clearly reflecting his own abilities, often calling for great velocity, enormous leaps at speed, long stretches of fast repeated notes, and the maintenance of widely spaced contrapuntal lines.Smith (2000) II, 17, 245. The illustration (right) from the Grande sonate is analysed by Smith as \\"six parts in invertible counterpoint, plus two extra voices and three doublings ‚Äì eleven parts in all.\\"Smith (2000) II,75. Some typical musical devices, such as a sudden explosive final chord following a quiet passage, were established at an early stage in Alkan's compositions.Smith (2000) II, 18. Macdonald suggests that > unlike Wagner, Alkan did not seek to refashion the world through opera; nor, > like Berlioz, to dazzle the crowds by putting orchestral music at the > service of literary expression; nor even, as with Chopin or Liszt, to extend > the field of harmonic idiom. Armed with his key instrument, the piano, he > sought incessantly to transcend its inherent technical limits, remaining > apparently insensible to the restrictions which had withheld more restrained > composers.Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 130 (translated from the original French). However, not all of Alkan's music is either lengthy or technically difficult; for example, many of the Op. 31 Pr√©ludes and of the set of Esquisses, Op. 63.Smith (2000) II, 38‚Äì9, 47. Moreover, in terms of structure, Alkan in his compositions sticks to traditional musical forms, although he often took them to extremes, as he did with piano technique. The study Op. 39, no. 8 (the first movement of the Concerto for solo piano) takes almost half an hour in performance. Describing this \\"gigantic\\" piece, Ronald Smith comments that it convinces for the same reasons as does the music of the classical masters; \\"the underlying unity of its principal themes, and a key structure that is basically simple and sound.\\"Smith (2000) II, 128, 134. Some of Alkan's music gives hints of the obsessiveness which some have detected in his personality.See McCallum, S. (2007), 2-10; Conway (2012), 234-5. The Chant Op. 38, no. 2, entitled Fa, repeats the note of its title incessantly (in total 414 times) against shifting harmonies which make it \\"cut ... into the texture with the ruthless precision of a laser beam.\\"Smith (2000) II, 57 In modelling his five sets of Chants on the first book of Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words, Alkan ensured that the pieces in each of his sets followed precisely the same key signatures, and even the moods, of the original.McCallum, P. (2013), 5. Alkan was rigorous in his enharmonic spelling, occasionally modulating to keys containing double-sharps or double-flats, so pianists are occasionally required to come to terms with unusual keys such as E major, the enharmonic equivalent to F major, and the occasional triple-sharp. WorksEarly works= From the 1838 Study for left hand alone Alkan's earliest works indicate, according to Smith, that in his early teens he \\"was a formidable musician but as yet ... industrious rather than ... creative\\".Smith (2000) II, 1. Only with his 12 Caprices (Opp.12‚Äì13 and 15‚Äì16, 1837) did his compositions begin to attract serious critical attention. The op. 15 set, Souvenirs: Trois morceaux dans le genre path√©tique, dedicated to Liszt, contains Le vent (The Wind), which was at one time the only piece by the composer to figure regularly in recitals. These works, however, did not meet with the approval of Robert Schumann, who wrote: \\"One is startled by such false, such unnatural art ... the last [piece, titled Morte (Death), is] a crabbed waste, overgrown with brush and weeds ... nothing is to be found but black on black\\".Schumann (1880), 317, cited in Conway (2012), 226. Ronald Smith, however, finds in this latter work, which cites the Dies Irae theme also used by Berlioz, Liszt and others, foreshadowings of Maurice Ravel, Modest Mussorgsky and Charles Ives.Smith (2000) II, 21‚Äì2. Schumann did, however, respond positively to the pieces of Les mois (originally part published as Op. 8 in 1838, later published as a complete set in 1840 as Op. 74): \\"[Here] we find such an excellent jest on operatic music in no. 6 [L'Op√©ra] that a better one could scarcely be imagined ... The composer ... well understands the rarer effects of his instrument.\\"Schumann (1880), 486, cited in Conway (2012), 227. Alkan's technical mastery of the keyboard was asserted by the publication in 1838 of the Trois grandes √©tudes (originally without opus number, later republished as Op. 76), the first for the left hand alone, the second for the right hand alone, the third for both hands; and all of great difficulty, described by Smith as \\"a peak of pianistic transcendentalism\\".Smith (2000) II, 90. This is perhaps the earliest example of writing for a single hand as \\"an entity in its own right, capable of covering all registers of the piano, of rendering itself as accompanied soloist or polyphonist.\\"Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 25 (translated from the original French). =Early maturity= Opening of the second movement (\\"Quasi-Faust\\") of the Sonate Op. 33, marked \\"Sataniquement\\" (satanically)Alkan's large scale Duo (in effect a sonata) Op. 21 for violin and piano (dedicated to Chr√©tien Urhan) and his Piano Trio Op. 30 appeared in 1841. Apart from these, Alkan published only a few minor works between 1840 and 1844, after which a series of virtuoso works was issued, many of which he had played at his successful recitals at √ârard and elsewhere;Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 29. these included the Marche fun√®bre (Op. 26), the Marche triomphale (Op. 27) and Le chemin de fer (also published, separately, as Op. 27). In 1847 appeared the Op. 31 Pr√©ludes (in all major and minor keys, with an extra closing piece returning to C major) and his first large-scale unified piano work, the Grande sonate Les quatre √¢ges (Op. 33). The sonata is structurally innovative in two ways; each movement is slower than its predecessor, and the work anticipates the practice of progressive tonality, beginning in D major and ending in G minor. Dedicated to Alkan Morhange, the sonata depicts in its successive movements its 'hero' at the ages of 20 (optimistic), 30 (\\"Quasi-Faust\\", impassioned and fatalistic), 40 (domesticated) and 50 (suffering: the movement is prefaced by a quotation from Aeschylus's Prometheus Unbound).Smith (2000) II, 67‚Äì80. In 1848 followed Alkan's set of 12 √©tudes dans tous les tons majeurs Op. 35, whose substantial pieces range in mood from the hectic Allegro barbaro (no. 5) and the intense Chant d'amour-Chant de mort (Song of Love ‚Äì Song of Death) (no. 10) to the descriptive and picturesque L'incendie au village voisin (The Fire in the Next Village) (no. 7).Smith (2000) II, 98‚Äì109. A number of Alkan's compositions from this period were never performed and have been lost. Among the missing works are some string sextets and a full-scale orchestral symphony in B minor, which was described in an article in 1846 by the critic L√©on Kreutzer, to whom Alkan had shown the score.Conway (2012), 208, 236 Kreutzer noted that the introductory adagio of the symphony was headed \\"by Hebrew characters in red ink ... This is no less than the verse from Genesis: And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\\" Kreutzer opined that, set beside Alkan's conception, Joseph Haydn's Creation was a \\"mere candle (lampion).\\"Kreutzer (1846), 13-4. Translation based on citation in Conway (2012), 237. A further missing work is a one-act opera, mentioned frequently in the French musical press of 1846-7 as being shortly to be produced at the Op√©ra-Comique, which however never materialized. Alkan also referred to this work in a letter of 1847 to the musicologist Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis, stating that it had been written \\"a few years ago.\\" Its subject, title and librettist remain unknown.Hammond (2017), pp. 7-9. =Internal exile= Theme of the variations op. 39 no. 12, Le festin d'√âsopeDuring his twenty-year absence from the public between 1853 and 1873 Alkan produced many of his most notable compositions, although there is a ten-year gap between publication of the Op. 35 studies and that of his next group of piano works in 1856 and 1857. Of these, undoubtedly the most significant was the enormous Opus 39 collection of twelve studies in all the minor keys, which contains the Symphony for Solo Piano (numbers four, five, six and seven), and the Concerto for Solo Piano (numbers eight, nine and ten). The Concerto takes nearly an hour in performance. Number twelve of Op. 39 is a set of variations, Le festin d'√âsope (Aesop's Feast). The other components of Op. 39 are of a similar stature. Smith describes Op. 39 as a whole as \\"a towering achievement, gathering ... the most complete manifestation of Alkan's many-sided genius: its dark passion, its vital rhythmic drive, its pungent harmony, its occasionally outrageous humour, and, above all, its uncompromising piano writing.\\"Smith (2000) II, 110 In the same year appeared the Sonate de Concert, Op. 47, for cello and piano, \\"among the most difficult and ambitious in the romantic repertoire ... anticipating Mahler in its juxtaposition of the sublime and the trivial\\". In the opinion of the musicologist Brigitte Fran√ßois-Sappey, its four movements again show an anticipation of progressive tonality, each ascending by a major third.Francois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 45 (quotation translated from the original French). Other anticipations of Mahler (who was born in 1860) can be found in the two \\"military\\" Op. 50 piano studies of 1859 Capriccio alla soldatesca and Le tambour bat aux champs (The drum beats the retreat),Francois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 50. as well as in certain of the miniatures of the 1861 Esquisses, Op. 63.Smith (2000) II, 47. The bizarre and unclassifiable Marcia funebre, sulla morte d'un Pappagallo (Funeral march on the death of a parrot, 1859), for three oboes, bassoon and voices, described by Kenneth Hamilton as \\"Monty-Pythonesque\\",Liang, Chang Tou, \\"Kenneth Hamilton on the Cult of Alkan (Part 1)\\", Pianomania, accessed 15 May 2013. is also of this period. Extract from Les diablotins Op. 63 no. 45 featuring tone clusters The Esquisses of 1861 are a set of highly varied miniatures, ranging from the tiny 18-bar no. 4, Les cloches (The Bells), to the strident tone clusters of no. 45, Les diablotins (The Imps), and closing with a further evocation of church bells in no. 49, Laus Deo (Praise God). Like the earlier Preludes and the two sets of Etudes, they span all the major and minor keys (in this case covering each key twice, with an extra piece in C major).Smith (2000) II, 46‚Äì50. They were preceded in publication by Alkan's deceptively titled Sonatine, Op. 61, in 'classical' format, but a work of \\"ruthless economy [which] although it plays for less than twenty minutes ... is in every way a major work.\\"Smith (2000) II, 81. Two of Alkan's substantial works from this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op. 45 (1856), follows a section of the poem La M√©lancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouv√©;Legouv√© (1828), 182-3. while Super flumina Babylonis, Op. 52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 (\\"By the waters of Babylon ...\\"). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation.Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 50. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn (Opp. 38, 65, 67, and 70), which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces, such as three Nocturnes, Opp. 57 and 60bis (1859). Alkan's publications for organ or p√©dalier commenced with his Benedictus, Op. 54 (1859). In the same year he published a set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes (1859, without opus number), which, in Smith's opinion, \\"seem to stand outside the barriers of time and space\\", and which he believes reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty.\\"Smith (2000) II, 223. These were followed by pieces such as the 13 Pri√®res (Prayers), Op. 64 (1865), and the Impromptu sur le Choral de Luther \\"Un fort rempart est notre Dieu\\" , Op. 69 (1866).Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013) 60‚Äì65. Alkan also issued a book of 12 studies for the pedalboard alone (no opus number, 1866) and the Bombardo-carillon for pedalboard duet (four feet) of 1872.Fran√ßois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 63, 69. Alkan's return to the concert platform at his Petits Concerts, however, marked the end of his publications; his final work to be issued was the Toccatina, Op. 75, in 1872.Smith (2000) II, 170. Reception and legacy Ferruccio BusoniAlkan had few followers; however, he had important admirers, including Liszt, Anton Rubinstein, Franck, and, in the early twentieth century, Busoni, Petri and Sorabji. Rubinstein dedicated his fifth piano concerto to him,Fran√ßois-Sappey (1991), 201, n.2. and Franck dedicated to Alkan his Grand pi√®ce symphonique op. 17 for organ.Smith (2000) II, 221. Busoni ranked Alkan with Liszt, Chopin, Schumann and Brahms as one of the five greatest composers for the piano since Beethoven.Smith (2000) I, 11. Isidor Philipp and Delaborde edited new printings of his works in the early 1900s.Smith (2000) I, 76‚Äì7. In the first half of the twentieth century, when Alkan's name was still obscure, Busoni and Petri included his works in their performances.Francois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013) 151. Sorabji published an article on Alkan in his 1932 book Around Music;Sorabji, Kaikhosru, \\"Charles Henri Valentin Morhange (Alkan)\\", reprinted in Alkan Society Bulletin 87, pp. 5‚Äì8, accessed 30 September 2017. he promoted Alkan's music in his reviews and criticism, and his Sixth Symphony for Piano (Symphonia claviensis) (1975‚Äì76), includes a section entitled Quasi Alkan.\\"Sorabji's Piano Symphony no. 6, Symphonia Clavinienses\\", ‚ÄìAlkan Society Bulletin 87 pp. 4‚Äì5, accessed 30 September 2017.Roberge, Marc-Andr√©, \\"Titles of Works Grouped by Categories \\", Sorabji Resource Site, accessed 18 May 2013. The English composer and writer Bernard van Dieren praised Alkan in an essay in his 1935 book, Down Among the Dead Men,Smith (2000), II, 103. and the composer Humphrey Searle also called for a revival of his music in a 1937 essay.Searle (1937), passim. The pianist and writer Charles Rosen however considered Alkan \\"a minor figure\\", whose only music of interest comes after 1850 as an extension of Liszt's techniques and of \\"the operatic techniques of Meyerbeer.\\"Rosen (1995), p. x. For much of the 20th century, Alkan's work remained in obscurity, but from the 1960s onwards it was steadily revived. Raymond Lewenthal gave a pioneering extended broadcast on Alkan on WBAI radio in New York in 1963,\\"Raymond Lewenthal Collection\\", University of Maryland, accessed 13 July 2013 and later included Alkan's music in recitals and recordings. The English pianist Ronald Smith championed Alkan's music through performances, recordings, a biography and the Alkan Society of which he was president for many years.Shaw, Richard, \\"Ronald Smith: Heroic pianist and champion of the music of Alkan\\", The Guardian, 8 July 2004, accessed 16 May 2013. Works by Alkan have also been recorded by Jack Gibbons, Marc-Andr√© Hamelin, Mark Latimer, John Ogdon, H√ºseyin Sermet and Mark Viner, among many others.\\"Recordings of Alkan's Works, Alkan Society website, accessed 30 September 2017.

It is dedicated to Averil Kovacs and Fran√ßois Luguenot, respectively activists in the English and French Alkan Societies. As Hamelin writes in his preface to this √©tude, the idea to combine these came from the composer Alistair Hinton, the finale of whose Piano Sonata No. 5 (1994‚Äì95) includes a substantial section entitled \\"Alkanique\\".Hamelin (2005), iii. Alkan's compositions for organ have been among the last of his works to be brought back to the repertoire.Toccata Classics has made a complete recording \\"CDs featuring Charles-Valentin Alkan\\" , featuring Kevin Bowyer. As to Alkan's pedal-piano works, due to a recent revival of the instrument, they are once again being performed as originally intended (rather than on an organ), such as by Italian pedal-pianist Roberto Prosseda, and recordings of Alkan on the pedal piano have been made by Jean Dub√©Disque Syrius, SYR141446: op. 64, no. 5 (2011). and Olivier Latry.Naive, V5278: Op. 66, nos. 5 and 10 (2011).

S2 source code is compiled into Perl, which the webserver can then execute directly for individual web page requests. The S2 system is, at its heart, completely general and can be used for almost any web application; however there exists no documentation for the implementation of S2 within other applications, which ties it relatively closely to LiveJournal. This article will make use of LiveJournal's implementation of S2 for examples. A link to detailed documentation about this implementation can be found at the bottom. Language features S2's structure closely resembles that of most imperative programming languages, and includes basic instructions such as variable assignments, arithmetic operations, conditional flow control and for loops over finite sets (however, it distinctly lacks while loops). Being object-oriented, S2 allows the declaration of classes with members and methods, but global (non-class- specific) functions can also be defined. Recursion is allowed, but nesting functions is not. Layers and properties A distinguishing feature of S2 is that source code is organised into individual layers, of which there are six different types (core, i18nc, layout, i18n, theme and user). These layers form a tree-like structure. At the root lies the core layer, a layer which specifies all the classes and their methods which are specific to the website on which S2 is being used. In the case of LiveJournal, these classes represent individual journal views (Recent Entries, Archive, etc.) and site-related objects (users, journal entries, etc.). It provides simple default implementations of all the methods, but also global functions that are of general use. Some of the functions are specified as being \\"built-in\\" functions and are implemented in Perl in the S2 subsystem; all other functions are implemented in S2 itself and are compiled into Perl code by the S2 compiler. The S2 language introduces a concept of properties -- these are variables that are not specific to a particular object or class, but to a layer. Such a property can be a textual string, an integer number, a hexadecimal colour code, etc. The core layer, for instance, defines textual string properties to hold user-visible text in the English language. Subordinate to the core layer are the i18nc (\\"core internationalisation\\") layers, which allow for the textual string properties in the core layer to be overridden with translations into other languages. Also subordinate to the core layer are the layout layers. A layout layer specifies a particular site layout (journal layout in the case of LiveJournal), and it may provide new properties that influence the look and behaviour of the layout in various ways. A layout layer normally overrides almost all of the methods defined in the core layer, and it may introduce new ones to perform certain layout-specific tasks. If a core-defined method is called which is not overridden in the layout layer, but the same method is overridden for a superordinate class, then this superordinate method is called, rather than the class-specific default implementation in the core layer. The remaining three types of layers -- i18n layers, theme layers and user layers -- are all subordinate to a specific layout layer. In general, all three of them can override both properties and functions/methods from the layout layer, but their intended purpose varies. i18n are provided to internationalise the layout; this is to allow the layout to be used by speakers of other languages, but not primarily to provide a way to customise the user-visible text. theme layers can be used to provide suggested sets of values for the properties of a layout. A common application of this is to create aesthetically consistent colour themes, but in principle non-colour properties (fonts, sizes, etc.) can also be overridden in a theme layer. user layers, finally, are meant to store a particular user's preferences with regard to the values of the properties. The user layer ultimately has the \\"final say\\" on the values of the properties. Internationalisation As mentioned in the previous section, i18nc layers are used to translate the core layer, while i18n layers are used to translate a layout. In its simplest form, such an internationalisation layer overrides textual string properties in order to replace English text with a translation into another language. However, often the intricacies of languages require more sophisticated mechanisms, which is why the internationalisation layers sometimes override entire functions. For example, a plural-mapping function is provided which specifies how many and which strings a language uses following an integer number. Documentation S2 incorporates the idea of providing documentation for a class, method, function or property directly within the source code, separate (machine-distinguishable) from conventional comments. Small strings of explanatory text can be added after the header of a class, method, function or property, and they can be used to generate documentation. At the time of this writing, however, none of these strings are actually used, except for those associated with properties, which appear in the customisation wizard; see below. An i18n layer can override these documentary strings for properties in order to allow for speakers of other languages to be presented with explanations of the available options in their language. The customization wizard The S2 web user interface allows users to change the values of the properties of a layout without requiring them to write actual S2 source code. This interface is termed the \\"customization wizard\\", and it creates a user layer which stores the user's preferred values of the properties. Unintended uses of S2 S2 was entirely designed to be a web layout programming language. It had not originally been anticipated that it would soon be used to create \\"geeky\\" applications. In particular, at the time of this writing, four games have been written in S2: Towers of Hanoi , two versions of Tic Tac Toe, and a game called \\"Pawns\\" . One of the Tic Tac Toe versions has been embedded into a journal style as a box in a side-bar.

She is known for working extensively with a family of psychoacoustic phenomena called auditory distortion products (also known as distortion product otoacoustic emissions and combination tones), in which the ears themselves produce audible sound. Biography Amacher was born in Kane, Pennsylvania, to an American nurse and a Swiss freight train worker. As the only child, she grew up playing the piano. Amacher left Kane to attend the University of Pennsylvania on a full scholarship where she received a B.F.A in 1964. While there she studied composition with George Rochberg and Karlheinz Stockhausen. She also studied composition in Salzburg, Austria, and Dartington, England. Subsequently, she did graduate work in acoustics and computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. While in residence at the University of Buffalo, in 1967, she created City Links: Buffalo, a 28-hour piece using 5 microphones in different parts of the city, broadcast live by radio station WBFO. There were 21 other pieces in the \\"City Links\\" series, and more information can be found in the brochure for an exhibition on the series by Ludlow 38 in NYC (available on their website). A common feature was the use of dedicated, FM radio quality telephone (0‚Äì15,000 Hz range) lines to connect the sound environments of different sites into the same space, a very early example of what is now called \\"telematic performance\\" which preceded much more famous examples by Max Neuhaus, amongst others. (Neuhaus himself was involved with the original 1967 work in Buffalo.) Her major pieces have almost exclusively been site specific, often using many loudspeakers to create what she called \\"structure borne sound\\", differentiating it from \\"airborne sound\\", the paradox intentional. By using many diffuse sound sources (either not in the space or speakers facing at the walls or floors) she would create the psychoacoustic illusions of sound shapes or \\"presence\\". Amacher's early work is best represented in three series of multimedia installations produced in the United States, Europe, and Japan: the sonic telepresence series, \\"City Links 1‚Äì22\\" (1967‚Äì ); the architecturally staged \\"Music for Sound-Joined Rooms\\" (1980‚Äì ); and the \\"Mini-Sound Series\\" (1985‚Äì ) a new multimedia form she created that is unique in its use of architecture and serialized narrative. She was invited while doing a fellowship at the Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by John Cage to work on several projects. The collaboration resulted with a storm soundtrack for Cage‚Äôs multimedia ‚ÄúLecture on the Weather‚Äù (1975) and a work on sound environment ‚Äú Close Up‚Äù for a 10-hour solo voice work for Cage ‚ÄúEmpty Words‚Äù(1978). She also produced alongside other works, ‚ÄúTorse‚Äù for Cunningham from 1974 to 1980. Amacher worked extensively with a set of psychoacoustic phenomena known as 'auditory distortion products';Gary Kendall, Christopher Haworth, and Rodrigo C√°diz, \\"Sound Synthesis with Auditory Distortion Products\\", Computer Music Journal 38 no. 4 (2014 Winter): 5‚Äì23 . put simply: sounds generated inside the ear that are clearly audible to the hearer. These tones have a long history in music theory and scientific research, and are still the object of disagreement and debate. In music, they are most commonly known by the name of 'combination tones','difference tones', and sometimes 'Tartini tones' (after the violinist Giuseppe Tartini, who is credited with discovering them). Amacher herself termed them 'ear tones' until 1992, when she discovered the work of David T. Kemp and Thomas Gold and began referring to them by the psychoacoustical terminology of 'otoacoustic emissions'. It has since become clear that some of the sounds Amacher, and indeed all musicians who have exploited this phenomenon, were generating can be attributed to a particular family of otoacoustic emissions known as 'distortion product otoacoustic emissions' (DPOAE).Christopher Haworth, \\"Composing with Absent Sound\\", in Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference 2011, University of Huddersfield, UK, 31 July ‚Äì 5 August 2011, edited by Monty Adkins and Ben Isaacs, 342‚Äì45 (San Francisco: International Computer Music Association; Huddersfield: Centre for Research in New Music, University of Huddersfield, 2011). . Occurring in response to two pure tones presented simultaneously to the ear, these tones appear to localise in or around the head, as though there were a 'tiny loudspeaker inside the ear'. Amacher was the first to systematically explore the musical use of these phenomena using electroacoustic sound technologies. The subtitle of her first Tzadik Records album Sound Characters (Making the Third Ear) is a reference to them. She describes the subjective experience of these phenomena in the following passage: Over the years she received several major commissions in the United States and Europe with occasional work in Asia and Central and South America. Amacher received a 1998 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. In 2005, she was awarded the Prix Ars Electronica (the Golden Nica) in the \\"Digital Musics\\" category for her project \\"TEO! A sonic sculpture\\". At the time of her death she had been working three years on a 40-channel piece commissioned by the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center in Troy, New York. Maryanne Amacher has been an important influence for composers such as Rhys Chatham and Thurston Moore. For the last decade of her life she taught at the Bard College MFA program.

He was also the author of numerous other contributions to optics. Life and career Wolf was born into a Jewish family in Prague, CzechoslovakiaOral History Project: Interview with Emil Wolf. He was forced to leave his native country when the Germans invaded. After brief periods in Italy and France (where he worked for the Czech government in exile), he moved to the United Kingdom in 1940. He received his B.Sc. in Mathematics and Physics (1945), and Ph.D. in Mathematics from Bristol University, England, in 1948. Between 1951 and 1954 he worked at the University of Edinburgh with Max Born, writing the famous textbook on Optics now usually known simply as Born and Wolf. After a period on the Faculty of the University of Manchester, he moved to the United States in 1959 to take a position at the University of Rochester. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen and was the Wilson Professor of Optical Physics at the University of Rochester. He was president of the Optical Society of America in 1978. Until his death Wolf resided in Cloverwood in Pittsford, New York, with his wife. Wolf predicted a new mechanism that produces redshift and blueshift, that is not due to moving sources (Doppler effect), that has subsequently been confirmed experimentally (called the Wolf effect). Technically, he found that two non-Lambertian sources that emit beamed energy, can interact in a way that causes a shift in the spectral lines. It is analogous to a pair of tuning forks with similar frequencies (pitches), connected together mechanically with a sounding board; there is a strong coupling that results in the resonant frequencies getting \\"dragged down\\" in pitch. The Wolf effect can produce either redshifts or blueshifts, depending on the observer's point of view, but is redshifted when the observer is head-on. A subsequent 1999 article by Sisir Roy et al. have suggested that the Wolf effect may explain discordant redshift in certain quasars. Wolf remained an active teacher, researcher and author well into his 80s. He died on June 2, 2018, aged 95. Works Wolf was a very well known book author in the field of optics. Along with Max Born, he co- wrote Principles of Optics one of the standard textbooks of optics commonly known as \\"Born and Wolf\\". In addition he co-authored, with Leonard Mandel, Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics. He also authored Introduction to the Theory of Coherence and Polarization of Light and Selected Works of Emil Wolf with Commentary (World Scientific Publishing, 2001, ). Furthermore, he edited the Progress in Optics series of books, for Elsevier, from its inception in 1962.

He is considered one of the greatest pianists of the twentieth century.\\"Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Reclusive Pianist, Is Dead at 75,\\" The New York Times, 13 June 1995 Biography Born in Brescia, Italy, he began music lessons at the age of three, initially with the violin, but quickly switched to the piano. At the age of eleven he entered the Milan Conservatory, graduating three years later at fourteen. In 1938, at the age of eighteen, he began his international career by entering the Ysa√øe International Festival in Brussels, Belgium, where he was placed seventh. A brief account of this competition, at which Emil Gilels took first prize and Moura Lympany second, is given by Arthur Rubinstein, who was one of the judges. According to Rubinstein, Benedetti Michelangeli gave \\"an unsatisfactory performance, but already showed his impeccable technique.\\" A year later he earned first prize in the Geneva International Music Competition, where he was acclaimed as \\"a new Liszt\\" by pianist Alfred Cortot, a member of the judging panel, which was presided over by Ignacy Jan Paderewski. The Romanian conductor Sergiu Celibidache always saw in Benedetti Michelangeli a colleague, and not merely another competent pianist: ‚ÄúMichelangeli makes colors; he is a conductor.\\" Celibidache also considered Michelangeli the \\"greatest living artist\\". The teacher and commentator David Dubal argued that he was best in the earlier works of Beethoven and seemed insecure in Chopin, but that he was \\"demonic\\" in such works as the Bach-Busoni Chaconne and the Brahms Paganini Variations. His concert repertoire was seemingly strikingly small for a concert pianist of such stature, while we know from colleagues and students that he dominated most of the piano repertoire.Interview to the violinist Salvatore Accardo Owing to his perfectionism, relatively few recordings were officially released during Benedetti Michelangeli's lifetime, but these are augmented by numerous unauthorized recordings of live performances. Discographical highlights include the (authorized) live performances in London of Ravel's Gaspard de la nuit, Chopin's Mazurkas and Sonata No. 2, Schumann's Carnaval, Op. 9 and Faschingsschwank aus Wien, Op. 26 as well as various recordings of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5, Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1 and Totentanz, and the piano concertos of Robert Schumann, and Edvard Grieg. As a composer, Benedetti Michelangeli arranged 19 Italian Folksongs a cappella for the Coro della Societ√† Alpinisti Tridentini, a men's chorus from Trento (Italy). A recording of these pieces can be found on the DIVOX music label. As a teacher, his pupils included world-class artists as Pietro Maranca, Maurizio Pollini, Martha Argerich, Ivan Moravec, Paul Stewart, and Garth Beckett. On 20 September 1943 Benedetti Michelangeli married pianist Giulia Linda Guidetti, who was a pupil of his father. She was a valued counselor and secretary to her husband. She lived quietly, sharing time with her husband at their villa in Bornato, near Brescia, or in Bolzano or Arezzo, and appeared so seldom in public with her husband that hardly anybody knew he was married. They separated in 1970. From 1970 on, his secretary, and later his agent and partner, Marie-Jos√© Gros-Dubois, was faithfully near his side. She organized concerts and dates for him, and also presided over his financial affairs. Benedetti Michelangeli reputedly did not enjoy giving concerts. In an interview, Gros-Dubois remembered that he could not believe that his concerts were worth so much money. After a concert, she reported that he gloomily said: \\"You see, so much applause, so much public. Then, in half an hour, you feel alone more than before.\\" He was noted for his appreciation of Ferrari motorcars, and was also regarded as a proficient driver, having competed in the Mille Miglia race on three occasions. Benedetti Michelangeli was a connoisseur of the mechanics of the piano and he insisted that his concert instruments be in perfect condition.\\"Michelangeli was mysterious to the end,\\" The Baltimore Sun, 13 June 1995 Whenever possible he took his own Steinway piano with him on tour. His last concert (all Debussy) took place on 7 May 1993 in Hamburg, Germany. After an extended illness he died in Lugano, Switzerland. He is buried in nearby Pura.

William Kapell (September 20, 1922October 29, 1953) was an American pianist and recording artist, killed at the age of 31 in the crash of a commercial airliner returning from a concert tour in Australia. Biography William Kapell was born in New York City on September 20, 1922, and grew up in the eastside neighborhood of Yorkville, Manhattan, where his parents owned a Lexington Avenue bookstore.Downes (2013), p. 15 His father was of Spanish-Russian Jewish ancestry and his mother of Polish descent.William Kapell at Naxos.comTim Page, \\"William Kapell's Piano Benchmark\\", Washington Post, September 27, 1998 (at williamkapell.com). Dorothea Anderson La Follette (the wife of Chester La Follette) met Kapell at the Third Street Music School and became his teacher, giving him lessons several times a week at her studio on West 64th Street.Downes (2013), p. 18 Kapell later studied with Olga Samaroff, former wife of conductor Leopold Stokowski, at the Juilliard School. Kapell won his first competition at the age of ten and received as a prize a turkey dinner with the pianist Jos√© Iturbi. In 1941, he won the Philadelphia Orchestra's youth competition as well as the prestigious Naumburg Award. The following year, the Walter W. Naumburg Foundation sponsored the 19-year-old pianist's New York d√©but, a recital which won him the Town Hall Award for the year's outstanding concert by a musician under 30. He was immediately signed to an exclusive recording contract with RCA Victor. Kapell achieved fame while in his early twenties, in part as a result of his performances of Aram Khachaturian's Piano Concerto in D-flat. His 1946 world premiere recording of the piece with Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra was a sell-out hit.William Kapell Edition Vol 4 ‚Äì Khachaturian, Prokofiev‚ÄîNotes & Reviews at ArkivMusic.com Eventually, he became so associated with the work that he was referred to in some circles as \\"Khachaturian Kapell.\\" Besides his exciting pianism and stupendous technical gifts, Kapell's attractive appearance and mop of black hair helped make him a favorite with the public. By the late 1940s, Kapell had toured the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia to immense acclaim and was widely considered the most brilliant and audacious of his generation of young American pianistsJean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, \\"Solo nec plus ultra\\", Neva Editions, 2015, p.51. .. On May 18, 1948, he married Rebecca Anna Lou Melson, with whom he had two children. She was a fine pianist herself, having been a student of Sergei Tarnowsky, the teacher of Vladimir Horowitz. Early on, there was a tendency to typecast Kapell as a performer of technically difficult repertoire. While his technique was exceptional, he was a deep and versatile musician, and was memorably impatient with what he considered shallow or sloppy music making. His own repertoire was very diverse, encompassing works from J. S. Bach to Aaron Copland, who so admired Kapell's performances of his Piano Sonata that he was writing a new work for him at the time of the pianist's death. Kapell practiced up to eight hours a day, keeping track of his sessions with a notebook and clock. He also set aside time from his busy concert schedule to work with the musicians he most admired, including Artur Schnabel, Pablo Casals, and Rudolf Serkin. Kapell also approached Arthur Rubinstein and Vladimir Horowitz (whose East 94th Street townhouse was diagonally across the street from the Kapells' apartment) for lessons, but they demurred. Horowitz later commented that there was nothing he could have taught Kapell. From August to October 1953, Kapell toured Australia, playing 37 concerts in 14 weeks, appearing in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Bendigo, Shepparton, Albury, Horsham and finally in Geelong. Death and aftermath Kapell played the final concert of his Australian tour in Geelong, Victoria, on October 22, 1953, a recital which included a performance of Chopin's \\"Funeral March\\" Sonata. Days after the concert, he set off on his return flight to the United States, telling reporters at Mascot Airport he would never return to Australia because of the harsh comments from some Australian critics.Downes (2013), p. 115 He was aboard BCPA Flight 304 when on the morning of October 29, 1953, the plane, descending to land in fog, struck the treetops and crashed on Kings Mountain, south of the San Francisco airport. Everyone on board died.\\"19 Killed In B.C.P.A. Crash in U.S.A.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald, October 31, 1953, p. 1, National Library of Australia.

Retrieved 2012-08-17 His friend, broadcaster Alistair Cooke, covered Kapell's death in his Letter from America on October 30, 1953. On November 2, Kapell‚Äôs funeral took place at the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in New York; interment followed at the Mount Ararat Cemetery near Farmingdale, New York.Downes (2013), p. 16 Famed musician Isaac Stern set up the William Kapell Memorial Fund to bring notable musicians to the United States for wider experience. The Australian violinist Ernest Llewellyn, a long-time friend of Stern's, was the inaugural recipient in 1955.W. L. Hoffmann, \\"Lest we forget Isaac Stern\\", Canberra Times, October 24, 2001. The fascination with Kapell's playing has continued in the decades since his death. Pianists including Eugene Istomin, Gary Graffman, Leon Fleisher and Van Cliburn, and many others have acknowledged Kapell's influence. Fleisher stated that Kapell was \\"the greatest pianistic talent that this country has ever produced\\".Dubal, David. Reflections from the Keyboard, Kapell's widow, Anna Lou Dehavenon (1926‚Äì2012), undertook a career as an expert on homelessness in New York in part as a result, she said, of her own experience of suddenly becoming a single mother with no income. For the rest of her life she worked to keep her late husband's recordings before the public. Kapell's estate sued BCPA, Qantas (which had taken over BCPA in 1954), and BOAC (which was alleged to have sold Kapell the ticket). In 1964, more than ten years after the crash, Kapell's widow and two children were awarded US$924,396 in damages. The award was overturned on appeal in 1965. Kapell International Piano Competition and Festival In 1986, the University of Maryland's piano competition was renamed the William Kapell International Piano Competition in Kapell's honor. It became quadrennial in 1998 and is currently held at the university's Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center.Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center at Maryland ‚Äì The William Kapell International Piano Competition and Festival ‚Äì About the Competition and Festival Recordings In 1944, Kapell signed an exclusive recording contract with RCA Victor. Many of his recordings were originally issued as 78RPM records. Some were issued on LP, but by 1960, all of Kapell's commercial recordings were out of print. RCA Victor reissued Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 2 and Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3 on LP in the early 1970s. For decades, bootlegged copies of the commercial recordings and unlicensed recordings of \\"live\\" performances circulated among collectors. In the 1980s, RCA Victor released two compact discs of Kapell's recordings, including the Khatchaturian and Prokofiev Third Piano Concertos, and an all-Chopin disc. A nine-CD survey released by RCA Victor in 1998 contains Kapell's complete authorized recordings, including renditions of Chopin's mazurkas and sonatas as well as concertos by Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, and Khatchaturian. It also has many lesser-known items, some of them first releases, including Shostakovich preludes, Scarlatti sonatas, and the Copland Piano Sonata. The set sold remarkably well throughout the world and brought Kapell's work to a new audience. VAI 1027 contains broadcast recordings of the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3 and the Khatchaturian Piano Concerto. Arbiter 108 features part of the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 3 and the Shostakovich Concerto No. 1, and it includes Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, which also appears in the RCA Victor set, as well as on VAI 1048, the last from an Australian recital of July 21, 1953. In 2004, a number of recordings made during William Kapell's last Australian tour were returned to his family. These were released by RCA Victor in 2008 as Kapell Rediscovered. They contain several previously unknown performances of \\"God Save the Queen\\", Debussy's Suite bergamasque, Chopin's Barcarole, Op. 60, and Scherzo No. 1 in B minor, Op. 20, and Prokofiev's Sonata No. 7, Op. 83.

Foundations of Cryptography: Volume 1, Basic Tools, (draft available from author's site). Cambridge University Press. . (see also http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/foc-book.html) Commitment schemes are designed so that a party cannot change the value or statement after they have committed to it: that is, commitment schemes are binding. Commitment schemes have important applications in a number of cryptographic protocols including secure coin flipping, zero-knowledge proofs, and secure computation. A way to visualize a commitment scheme is to think of a sender as putting a message in a locked box, and giving the box to a receiver. The message in the box is hidden from the receiver, who cannot open the lock themselves. Since the receiver has the box, the message inside cannot be changed--merely revealed if the sender chooses to give them the key at some later time. Interactions in a commitment scheme take place in two phases: # the commit phase during which a value is chosen and specified # the reveal phase during which the value is revealed and checked In simple protocols, the commit phase consists of a single message from the sender to the receiver. This message is called the commitment. It is essential that the specific value chosen cannot be known by the receiver at that time (this is called the hiding property). A simple reveal phase would consist of a single message, the opening, from the sender to the receiver, followed by a check performed by the receiver. The value chosen during the commit phase must be the only one that the sender can compute and that validates during the reveal phase (this is called the binding property). The concept of commitment schemes was perhaps first formalized by Gilles Brassard, David Chaum, and Claude Crepeau in 1988,Gilles Brassard, David Chaum, and Claude Crepeau, Minimum Disclosure Proofs of Knowledge, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, vol. 37, pp. 156‚Äì189, 1988. as part of various Zero-Knowledge protocols for NP, based on various types of commitment schemes (see also: Russell Impagliazzo, Moti Yung: Direct Minimum- Knowledge Computations. CRYPTO 1987: 40-51 ). But the concept was used without being treated formally prior to that.Claude Cr√©peau, Commitment, MCgill.ca, accessed April 11, 2008 The notion of commitments appeared earliest in works by Manuel Blum, Shimon Even,Shimon Even. Protocol for signing contracts. In Allen Gersho, ed., Advances in Cryptography (proceedings of CRYPTO '82), pp. 148‚Äì153, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, 1982. and Shamir et al.A. Shamir, R. L. Rivest, and L. Adleman, Mental Poker. In David A. Klarner, ed., The Mathematical Gardner, pp. 37‚Äì43. Wadsworth, Belmont, California, 1981. The terminology seems to have been originated by Blum, although commitment schemes can be interchangeably called bit commitment schemes‚Äîsometimes reserved for the special case where the committed value is a bit. Earlier to that, commitment via one-way hash functions was considered, e.g., as part of, say, Lamport signature, the original one-time one-bit signature scheme. Applications=Coin flipping Suppose Alice and Bob want to resolve some dispute via coin flipping. If they are physically in the same place, a typical procedure might be: # Alice \\"calls\\" the coin flip # Bob flips the coin # If Alice's call is correct, she wins, otherwise Bob wins If Alice and Bob are not in the same place a problem arises. Once Alice has \\"called\\" the coin flip, Bob can stipulate the flip \\"results\\" to be whatever is most desirable for him. Similarly, if Alice doesn't announce her \\"call\\" to Bob, after Bob flips the coin and announces the result, Alice can report that she called whatever result is most desirable for her. Alice and Bob can use commitments in a procedure that will allow both to trust the outcome: # Alice \\"calls\\" the coin flip but only tells Bob a commitment to her call, # Bob flips the coin and reports the result, # Alice reveals what she committed to, # Bob verifies that Alice's call matches her commitment, # If Alice's revelation matches the coin result Bob reported, Alice wins For Bob to be able to skew the results to his favor, he must be able to understand the call hidden in Alice's commitment. If the commitment scheme is a good one, Bob cannot skew the results. Similarly, Alice cannot affect the result if she cannot change the value she commits to.Moni Naor, Bit Commitment Using Pseudorandomness, Journal of Cryptology 4: 2 pp. 151‚Äì158, 1991.Manuel Blum, Coin Flipping by Telephone, Proceedings of CRYPTO 1981, pp. 11‚Äì15, 1981, reprinted in SIGACT News vol. 15, pp. 23‚Äì27, 1983. A real-life application of this problem exists, when people (often in media) commit to a decision or give an answer in a \\"sealed envelope\\", which is then opened later. \\"Let's find out if that's what the candidate answered\\", for example on a game show, can serve as a model of this system. Zero-knowledge proofs One particular motivating example is the use of commitment schemes in zero-knowledge proofs. Commitments are used in zero-knowledge proofs for two main purposes: first, to allow the prover to participate in \\"cut and choose\\" proofs where the verifier will be presented with a choice of what to learn, and the prover will reveal only what corresponds to the verifier's choice. Commitment schemes allow the prover to specify all the information in advance, and only reveal what should be revealed later in the proof.Oded Goldreich, Silvio Micali, and Avi Wigderson, Proofs that yield nothing but their validity, or all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proof systems, Journal of the ACM, 38: 3, pp. 690‚Äì728, 1991 Commitments are also used in zero-knowledge proofs by the verifier, who will often specify their choices ahead of time in a commitment. This allows zero- knowledge proofs to be composed in parallel without revealing additional information to the prover.Oded Goldreich and Hugo Krawczyk, On the Composition of Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems, SIAM Journal on Computing, 25: 1, pp. 169‚Äì192, 1996 Signature schemes The Lamport signature scheme is a digital signature system that relies on maintaining two sets of secret data packets, publishing verifiable hashes of the data packets, and then selectively revealing partial secret data packets in a manner that conforms specifically to the data to be signed. In this way, the prior public commitment to the secret values becomes a critical part of the functioning of the system. Because the Lamport signature system cannot be used more than once (see the relevant article for details), a system to combine many Lamport Key- sets under a single public value that can be tied to a person and verified by others was developed. This system uses trees of hashes to compress many published lamport-key-commitments sets into a single hash value that can be associated with the prospective author of later verified data. Verifiable secret sharing  Another important application of commitments is in verifiable secret sharing, a critical building block of secure multiparty computation. In a secret sharing scheme, each of several parties receive \\"shares\\" of a value that is meant to be hidden from everyone. If enough parties get together, their shares can be used to reconstruct the secret, but even a malicious cabal of insufficient size should learn nothing. Secret sharing is at the root of many protocols for secure computation: in order to securely compute a function of some shared input, the secret shares are manipulated instead. However, if shares are to be generated by malicious parties, it may be important that those shares can be checked for correctness. In a verifiable secret sharing scheme, the distribution of a secret is accompanied by commitments to the individual shares. The commitments reveal nothing that can help a dishonest cabal, but the shares allow each individual party to check to see if their shares are correct. Defining the security Formal definitions of commitment schemes vary strongly in notation and in flavour. The first such flavour is whether the commitment scheme provides perfect or computational security with respect to the hiding or binding properties. Another such flavour is whether the commitment is interactive, i.e. whether both the commit phase and the reveal phase can be seen as being executed by a cryptographic protocol or whether they are non-interactive, consisting of two algorithms Commit and CheckReveal. In the latter case CheckReveal can often be seen as a derandomised version of Commit, with the randomness used by Commit constituting the opening information. If the commitment C to a value x is computed as C:=Commit(x,open) with open the randomness used for computing the commitment, then CheckReveal (C,x,open) simply consists in verifying the equation C=Commit (x,open). Using this notation and some knowledge about mathematical functions and probability theory we formalise different versions of the binding and hiding properties of commitments. The two most important combinations of these properties are perfectly binding and computationally hiding commitment schemes and computationally binding and perfectly hiding commitment schemes. Note that no commitment scheme can be at the same time perfectly binding and perfectly hiding ‚Äì a computationally unbounded adversary can simply generate Commit(x,open) for every value of x and open until finding a pair that outputs C, and in a perfectly binding scheme this uniquely identifies x. Computational binding Let open be chosen from a set of size 2^k, i.e., it can be represented as a k bit string, and let \\\\text{Commit}_k be the corresponding commitment scheme. As the size of k determines the security of the commitment scheme it is called the security parameter. Then for all non- uniform probabilistic polynomial time algorithms that output x,x' and open, open' of increasing length k, the probability that x eq x' and \\\\text{Commit}_k(x,open)=\\\\text{Commit}_k(x',open') is a negligible function in k. This is a form of asymptotic analysis. It is also possible to state the same requirement using concrete security: A commitment scheme Commit is (t,\\\\epsilon) secure, if for all algorithms that run in time t and output x,x',open,open' the probability that x eq x' and \\\\text{Commit}(x,open)=\\\\text{Commit}(x',open') is at most \\\\epsilon. Perfect, statistical, and computational hiding Let U_k be the uniform distribution over the 2^k opening values for security parameter k. A commitment scheme is respectively perfect, statistical, or computational hiding, if for all x eq x' the probability ensembles {\\\\text{Commit}_k(x,U_k)}_{k\\\\in\\\\N} and {\\\\text{Commit}_k(x',U_k)}_{k\\\\in\\\\N} are equal, statistically close, or computationally indistinguishable. Impossibility of universally composable commitment schemes It is impossible to realize commitment schemes in the universal composability (UC) framework. The reason is that UC commitment has to be extractable, as shown by Canetti and FischlinR. Canetti and M. Fischlin. Universally Composable Commitments. and explained below. The ideal commitment functionality, denoted here by F, works roughly as follows. Committer C sends value m to F, which stores it and sends \\"receipt\\" to receiver R. Later, C sends \\"open\\" to F, which sends m to R. Now, assume we have a protocol œÄ that realizes this functionality. Suppose that the committer C is corrupted. In the UC framework, that essentially means that C is now controlled by the environment, which attempts to distinguish protocol execution from the ideal process. Consider an environment that chooses a message m and then tells C to act as prescribed by œÄ, as if it has committed to m. Note here that in order to realize F, the receiver must, after receiving a commitment, output a message \\"receipt\\". After the environment sees this message, it tells C to open the commitment. The protocol is only secure if this scenario is indistinguishable from the ideal case, where the functionality interacts with a simulator S. Here, S has control of C. In particular, whenever R outputs \\"receipt\\", F has to do likewise. The only way to do that is for S to tell C to send a value to F. However, note that by this point, m is not known to S. Hence, when the commitment is opened during protocol execution, it is unlikely that F will open to m, unless S can extract m from the messages it received from the environment before R outputs the receipt. However a protocol that is extractable in this sense cannot be statistically hiding. Suppose such a simulator S exists. Now consider an environment that, instead of corrupting C, corrupts R instead. Additionally it runs a copy of S. Messages received from C are fed into S, and replies from S are forwarded to C. The environment initially tells C to commit to a message m. At some point in the interaction, S will commit to a value m; this message is handed to R, who outputs m. Note that by assumption we have m' = m with high probability. Now in the ideal process the simulator has to come up with m. But this is impossible, because at this point the commitment has not been opened yet, so the only message R can have received in the ideal process is a \\"receipt\\" message. We thus have a contradiction. Construction A commitment scheme can either be perfectly binding (it is impossible for Alice to alter her commitment after she has made it, even if she has unbounded computational resources) or perfectly concealing (it is impossible for Bob to find out the commitment without Alice revealing it, even if he has unbounded computational resources) but not both. Bit- commitment in the random oracle model Bit-commitment schemes are trivial to construct in the random oracle model. Given a hash function H with a 3k bit output, to commit the k-bit message m, Alice generates a random k bit string R and sends Bob H(Rm). The probability that any R, m exist where m ‚â† m such that H(Rm) = H(Rm) is ‚âà 2‚àík, but to test any guess at the message m Bob will need to make 2k (for an incorrect guess) or 2k-1 (on average, for a correct guess) queries to the random oracle. We note that earlier schemes based on hash functions, essentially can be thought of schemes based on idealization of these hash functions as random oracle. Bit-commitment from any one-way permutation One can create a bit-commitment scheme from any one-way function that is injective. The scheme relies on the fact that every one-way function can be modified (via the Goldreich-Levin theorem) to possess a computationally hard-core predicate (while retaining the injective property). Let f be an injective one-way function, with h a hard-core predicate. Then to commit to a bit b Alice picks a random input x and sends the triple :(h,f(x),b \\\\oplus h(x)) to Bob, where \\\\oplus denotes XOR, i.e., bitwise addition modulo 2. To decommit, Alice simply sends x to Bob. Bob verifies by computing f(x) and comparing to the committed value. This scheme is concealing because for Bob to recover b he must recover h(x). Since h is a computationally hard-core predicate, recovering h(x) from f(x) with probability greater than one-half is as hard as inverting f. Perfect binding follows from the fact that f is injective and thus f(x) has exactly one preimage. Bit-commitment from a pseudo-random generator Note that since we do not know how to construct a one-way permutation from any one-way function, this section reduces the strength of the cryptographic assumption necessary to construct a bit-commitment protocol. In 1991 Moni Naor showed how to create a bit-commitment scheme from a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator. The construction is as follows. If G is pseudo-random generator such that G takes n bits to 3n bits, then if Alice wants to commit to a bit b: *Bob selects a random 3n-bit vector R and sends R to Alice. *Alice selects a random n-bit vector Y and computes the 3n-bit vector G(Y). *If b=1 Alice sends G(Y) to Bob, otherwise she sends the bitwise exclusive-or of G(Y) and R to Bob. To decommit Alice sends Y to Bob, who can then check whether he initially received G(Y) or G(Y) \\\\oplus R. This scheme is statistically binding, meaning that even if Alice is computationally unbounded she cannot cheat with probability greater than 2‚àín. For Alice to cheat, she would need to find a Y', such that G(Y') = G(Y) \\\\oplus R. If she could find such a value, she could decommit by sending the truth and Y, or send the opposite answer and Y'. However, G(Y) and G(Y') are only able to produce 2n possible values each (that's 22n) while R is picked out of 23n values. She does not pick R, so there is a 22n/23n = 2‚àín probability that a Y' satisfying the equation required to cheat will exist. The concealing property follows from a standard reduction, if Bob can tell whether Alice committed to a zero or one, he can also distinguish the output of the pseudo-random generator G from true-random, which contradicts the cryptographic security of G. A perfectly binding scheme based on the discrete log problem and beyond Alice chooses a ring of prime order p, with multiplicative generator g. Alice randomly picks a secret value x from 0 to p ‚àí 1 to commit to and calculates c = gx and publishes c. The discrete logarithm problem dictates that from c, it is computationally infeasible to compute x, so under this assumption, Bob cannot compute x. On the other hand, Alice cannot compute a x' <> x, such that gx' = c, so the scheme is binding. This scheme isn't perfectly concealing as someone could find the commitment if he manages to solve the discrete logarithm problem. In fact, this scheme isn't hiding at all with respect to the standard hiding game, where an adversary should be unable to guess which of two messages he chose were committed to - similar to the IND-CPA game. One consequence of this is that if the space of possible values of x is small, then an attacker could simply try them all and the commitment would not be hiding. A better example of a perfectly binding commitment scheme is one where the commitment is the encryption of x under a semantically secure, public-key encryption scheme with perfect completeness, and the decommitment is the string of random bits used to encrypt x. An example of an information-theoretically hiding commitment scheme is the Pedersen commitment scheme, which is binding under the discrete logarithm assumption. Additionally to the scheme above, it uses another generator h of the prime group and a random number r. The commitment is set c=g^x h^r. These constructions are tightly related to and based on the algebraic properties of the underlying groups, and the notion originally seemed to be very much related to the algebra. However, it was shown that basing statistically binding commitment schemes on general unstructured assumption is possible, via the notion of interactive hashing for commitments from general complexity assumptions (specifically and originally, based on any one way permutation) as in.Moni Naor, Rafail Ostrovsky, Ramarathnam Venkatesan, Moti Yung: Perfect Zero-Knowledge Arguments for NP Using Any One- Way Permutation. J. Cryptology 11(2): 87-108 (1998) Quantum bit commitment It is an interesting question in quantum cryptography if unconditionally secure bit commitment protocols exist on the quantum level, that is, protocols which are (at least asymptotically) binding and concealing even if there are no restrictions on the computational resources. One could hope that there might be a way to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanics, as in the protocols for unconditionally secure key distribution. However, this is impossible, as Dominic Mayers showed in 1996 (see Brassard, Cr√©peau, Mayers, Salvail: A brief review on the impossibility of quantum bit commitment for the original proof). Any such protocol can be reduced to a protocol where the system is in one of two pure states after the commitment phase, depending on the bit Alice wants to commit. If the protocol is unconditionally concealing, then Alice can unitarily transform these states into each other using the properties of the Schmidt decomposition, effectively defeating the binding property. One subtle assumption of the proof is that the commit phase must be finished at some point in time. This leaves room for protocols that require a continuing information flow until the bit is unveiled or the protocol is cancelled, in which case it is not binding anymore.A. Kent: Secure classical Bit Commitment using Fixed Capacity Communication Channels More generally, Mayers' proof applies only to protocols that exploit quantum physics but not special relativity. Kent has shown that there exist unconditionally secure protocols for bit commitment that exploit the principle of special relativity stating that information cannot travel faster than light. Commitments based on physical unclonable functions Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) rely on the use of a physical key with internal randomness, which is hard to clone or to emulate. Electronic, optical and other types of PUFs have been discussed extensively in the literature, in connection with their potential cryptographic applications including commitment schemes.

Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court on campaign finance. A majority of justices held that limits on election spending in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 ¬ß 608 are unconstitutional. In a per curiam (by the Court) opinion, they ruled that expenditure limits contravene the First Amendment provision on freedom of speech because a restriction on spending for political communication necessarily reduces the quantity of expression. It limited disclosure provisions and limited the Federal Election Commission's power. Justice Byron White dissented in part and wrote that Congress had legitimately recognized unlimited election spending \\"as a mortal danger against which effective preventive and curative steps must be taken\\". Buckley v. Valeo was extended by the U.S. Supreme Court in further cases, including in the five to four decision of First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti in 1978. and Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010. The latter held that corporations may spend from their general treasuries during elections. In 2014, McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission held that aggregate limits on political giving by an individual are unconstitutional.572 U.S. ___ (2014) By some measures, Buckley is the longest opinion ever issued by the Supreme Court. Facts Congress had made previous attempts to regulate campaign finance. It passed the Tillman Act of 1907, and then the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act in 1947. Neither was well enforced. Then, in 1974, Congress passed significant amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), creating the most comprehensive effort by the federal government to date to regulate federal campaign contributions and spending. President Gerald Ford signed the bill into law on October 15. The key parts of the amended law did the following: *limited contributions to candidates for federal office (2 USC ¬ß441a) *required the disclosure of political contributions (2 USC ¬ß434), *provided for the public financing of presidential elections (IRC Subtitle H), *limited expenditures by candidates and associated committees, *limited independent expenditures to $1,000 (formerly 18 U.S.C. ¬ß608e), *limited candidate expenditures from personal funds (formerly 18 U.S.C. ¬ß608a), *created and fixed the method of appointing members to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) (formerly 2 U.S.C. ¬ß437c(a) (1)(A‚ÄìC)). Eight members of the commission were to be chosen as follows: the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives were ex officio members of the Commission without a right to vote; two members would be appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate upon recommendations of the majority and minority leaders of the Senate; two would be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives upon recommendations of the majority and minority leaders of the House, and two would be appointed by the President. The six voting members would then need to be confirmed by the majority of both Houses of Congress. In addition, there was a requirement that each of the three appointing authorities was forbidden to choose both of their appointees from the same political party. The lawsuit was filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia, on January 2, 1975, by U.S. Senator James L. Buckley (a member of the Conservative Party of New York State), former U.S. Senator and 1968 presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy (a Democrat from Minnesota), the New York Civil Liberties Union,https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/aclu- amicus-brief-federal-election-commission-v-akins the American Conservative Union, the Peace & Freedom Party, the Libertarian Party, and numerous other plaintiffs. The named defendant in the caption was Francis R. Valeo, the Secretary of the Senate, an ex officio member of the FEC who represented the U.S. federal government. The trial court denied plaintiffs' request for declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs then appealed to the Court of Appeals and finally to the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs argued that the legislation violated the 1st and 5th Amendment rights to freedom of expression and due process, respectively. Judgment In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court held that several key provisions of the Campaign Finance Act, ¬ß 608(a), which limited expenditure by political campaigns, are unconstitutional and contrary to the First Amendment. The major holdings were as follows: * The Court upheld limits on contributions to candidates. * The Court upheld limitations on volunteers' incidental expenses. * The Court upheld the aggregate limit on an individual's total contributions to all candidates and committees in a calendar year. * The Court struck down limits on expenditures by candidates. * The Court struck down limits on independent expenditures (i.e., expenditures by other groups or individuals than candidates and political parties). * The Court upheld mandatory disclosure and reporting provisions, but it narrowed the types of speech to which they could apply. * The Court upheld a system of voluntary government funding of campaigns, including limits on spending by candidates who choose to accept government subsidies. * The Court struck down the system by which members of Congress directly appointed Federal Election Commission commissioners. The Court's opinion begins by stating certain \\"General Principles\\", and then dealing with individual parts of the law in turn. General principles * First, the Court cited the importance of the First Amendment issues at stake: \\"The Act's contribution and expenditure limitations operate in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities. Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution. The First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such political expression in order 'to assure (the) unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.'\\" The Court stated that these issues include \\"political association as well as political expression.\\" * The Court rejected the idea that limits on campaign contributions and spending merely limited conduct: \\"[T]his Court has never suggested that the dependence of a communication on the expenditure of money operates itself to ... reduce the exacting scrutiny required by the First Amendment.\\" The opinion cited New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, and it noted that sending a telegram to a public official‚Äîa clearly protected activity‚Äîcosts money. * Further, even if considered \\"conduct\\", the Court found that \\"it is beyond dispute that the interest in regulating the alleged 'conduct' of giving or spending money 'arises in some measure because the communication allegedly integral to the conduct is itself thought to be harmful.'\\" * The restrictions were not justified under the \\"times, places, and manner\\" clause giving the government the authority to regulate elections: The restrictions were \\"direct quantity restrictions on political communication and association by persons, groups, candidates, and political parties.\\" * The Court affirmed a First Amendment interest in spending money to facilitate campaign speech, writing, \\"A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\\" Further, the law's \\"$1,000 ceiling on spending 'relative to a clearly identified candidate,' would appear to exclude all citizens and groups except candidates, political parties, and the institutional press from any significant use of the most effective modes of communication.\\" (citations omitted). * However, \\"limitation[s] upon the amount that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributor's ability to engage in free communication\\", because such persons or groups are free to communicate directly with voters. Nevertheless, \\"[g]iven the important role of contributions in financing political campaigns, contribution restrictions could have a severe impact on political dialogue if the limitations prevented candidates and political committees from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.\\" * \\"The Act's contribution and expenditure limitations also impinge on protected associational freedoms. Making a contribution, like joining a political party, serves to affiliate a person with a candidate.\\" * Finally, the Court concluded this section by stating, \\"In sum, although the Act's contribution and expenditure limitations both implicate fundamental First Amendment interests, its expenditure ceilings impose significantly more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression and association than do its limitations on financial contributions.\\" Contribution limits * The Court held that restrictions on \\"large campaign contributions\\" are justified by the state's interest in \\"the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption spawned by the real or imagined coercive influence of large financial contributions on candidates' positions and on their actions if elected to office.\\" The Court further defined \\"corruption\\" to mean \\"large contributions ... given to secure a political quid pro quo from current and potential office holders.\\" * The Court rejected the plaintiffs' claim that all \\"contribution limitations must be invalidated because bribery laws and narrowly drawn disclosure requirements constitute a less restrictive means of dealing with 'proven and suspected quid pro quo arrangements.'\\" * Thus the Court upheld the limits on contributions to candidates and their campaign committees, and to parties and political action committees, in the Act. Expenditure limits * The Court first reiterated that \\"[t]he Act's expenditure ceilings impose direct and substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech.\\" It reviewed the sweeping scope of the law, noting, \\"The plain effect of [the Act] is to prohibit all individuals, who are neither candidates nor owners of institutional press facilities, and all groups, except political parties and campaign organizations, from voicing their views 'relative to a clearly identified candidate' through means that entail aggregate expenditures of more than $1,000 during a calendar year. The provision, for example, would make it a federal criminal offense for a person or association to place a single one- quarter page advertisement 'relative to a clearly identified candidate' in a major metropolitan newspaper.\\" * The Court held that the \\"key operative language of the provision ... [‚Äî]\\"any expenditure ... relative to a clearly identified candidate\\"‚Äîwas unconstitutionally vague, for it \\"fails to clearly mark the boundary between permissible and impermissible speech, unless other portions of [the Act] make sufficiently explicit the range of expenditures covered by the limitation. The section prohibits 'any expenditure ... relative to a clearly identified candidate during a calendar year which, when added to all other expenditures ... advocating the election or defeat of such candidate, exceeds, $1,000.' (Emphasis added.) This context clearly permits, if indeed it does not require, the phrase \\"relative to\\" a candidate to be read to mean 'advocating the election or defeat of' a candidate.\\" The Court elaborated in a footnote that \\"[t]his construction would restrict the application of [the law] to communications containing express words of advocacy of election or defeat, such as 'vote for,' 'elect,' 'support,' 'cast your ballot for,' 'Smith for Congress,' 'vote against,' 'defeat,' 'reject.'\\" * Even after narrowing the scope of the provision, however, the Court found that limits on expenditures are unconstitutional. \\"We find that the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption is inadequate to justify s 608(e)(1)'s ceiling on independent expenditures... First, assuming, arguendo, that large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements as do large contributions, Sec. 608(e)(1) does not provide an answer that sufficiently relates to the elimination of those dangers. Unlike the contribution limitations' total ban on the giving of large amounts of money to candidates, Sec. 608(e)(1) prevents only some large expenditures. So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his views. The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness thus undermines the limitation's effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or office-holder.\\" * \\"Second, quite apart from the shortcomings ... in preventing any abuses generated by large independent expenditures, the independent advocacy restricted by the provision does not presently appear to pose dangers of real or apparent corruption comparable to those identified with large campaign contributions ... The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate. Rather than preventing circumvention of the contribution limitations, Sec. 608(e)(1) severely restricts all independent advocacy despite its substantially diminished potential for abuse.\\" * The Court rejected the notion that a \\"governmental interest in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections serves to justify the limitation on express advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates imposed by Sec. 608(e)(1)'s expenditure ceiling ... [T]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed 'to secure \\"the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources,\\"' and '\\"to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.\\"'\\" * Thus, the Court struck down limits on both candidate and independent spending as unconstitutional. Reporting and disclosure requirements * The Court recognized that reporting and disclosure requirements infringe on First Amendment rights. \\"[W]e have repeatedly found that compelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment.\\" * However, the Court held that the government has a vital interest in \\"provid[ing] the electorate with information 'as to where political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate' in order to aid the voters in evaluating those who seek federal office\\", a vital interest in allowing \\"voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely than is often possible solely on the basis of party labels and campaign speeches.\\" These interests are a result of the fact that \\"the sources of a candidate's financial support also alert the voter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be responsive and thus facilitate predictions of future performance in office.\\" Further, \\"disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity.\\" Finally, \\"recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure requirements are an essential means of gathering the data necessary to detect violations of the contribution limitations described above.\\" * However, the Court again found the statute's reach, as written, to be unconstitutionally overbroad. It thus ruled that the Act's disclosure requirements apply to \\"individuals and groups that are not candidates or political committees only in the following circumstances: (1) when they make contributions earmarked for political purposes or authorized or requested by a candidate or his agent, to some person other than a candidate or political committee, and (2) when they make expenditures for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\\" Public funding of campaigns * The Court ruled that the government can directly subsidize political campaigns, but that it cannot require candidates to forego private fundraising if they choose the subsidy instead. * The Court held that the government can condition receipt of the campaign subsidy on a candidate's voluntary agreement to limit his or her total spending. Make-up of FEC * The Court held that the method for appointments to the Federal Election Commission was an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers.nb Associate Justice Harry Blackmun's papers indicate that Associate Justice William Rehnquist drafted the separation-of-powers portion of the per curiam opinion. The Court opined that these powers could properly be exercised by an \\"Officer of the United States\\" (validly appointed under Article II, Section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution) but held that the Commissioners could not exercise this significant authority because they were not \\"appointed\\". Id. at 137. Burger and Rehnquist agreed that limits on expenditure are unconstitutional, but dissented otherwise, stating that they would have held much larger parts of the Act to be unconstitutional. Dissents Only eight Justices heard the case. The opinion was a per curiam opinion, that is, not authored by a single justice, but an opinion for the Court. Several justices dissented from portions of the opinion. Justice White would have upheld all the restrictions on both contributions and expenditures, striking down only the FEC's appointment process. He said the following.424 US 1, 260-5 (1976) > Justice White (above) would have upheld the law's limits on expenditures and > contributions. Concededly, neither the limitations on contributions nor > those on expenditures directly or indirectly purport to control the content > of political speech by candidates or by their supporters or detractors.

Justice Marshall dissented on the point of limiting personal contributions and expenditures by a candidate to his or her own campaign ‚Äì he would have upheld that provision, which was stricken by the Court.424 US 1, 288 (1976) > One of the points on which all Members of the Court agree is that money is > essential for effective communication in a political campaign.

Justice Rehnquist dissented on the application of the public funding provisions to minor parties, believing that it was unconstitutional as applied to them. Justice Blackmun would have held that contribution limits are unconstitutional. Chief Justice Burger would have held that contribution limits are unconstitutional, that the government financing provisions are unconstitutional, and that disclosure of small contributions to campaigns is unconstitutional.

Valeo"},{"id":"439497","text":"The classical limit or correspondence limit is the ability of a physical theory to approximate or \\"recover\\" classical mechanics when considered over special values of its parameters. The classical limit is used with physical theories that predict non-classical behavior. Quantum theory A heuristic postulate called the correspondence principle was introduced to quantum theory by Niels Bohr: in effect it states that some kind of continuity argument should apply to the classical limit of quantum systems as the value of Planck's constant normalized by the action of these systems becomes very small. Often, this is approached through \\"quasi-classical\\" techniques (cf. WKB approximation). More rigorously, the mathematical operation involved in classical limits is a group contraction, approximating physical systems where the relevant action is much larger than Planck's constant , so the \\"deformation parameter\\" / can be effectively taken to be zero (cf. Weyl quantization.) Thus typically, quantum commutators (equivalently, Moyal brackets) reduce to Poisson brackets, in a group contraction. In quantum mechanics, due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, an electron can never be at rest; it must always have a non-zero kinetic energy, a result not found in classical mechanics. For example, if we consider something very large relative to an electron, like a baseball, the uncertainty principle predicts that it cannot really have zero kinetic energy, but the uncertainty in kinetic energy is so small that the baseball can effectively appear to be at rest, and hence it appears to obey classical mechanics. In general, if large energies and large objects (relative to the size and energy levels of an electron) are considered in quantum mechanics, the result will appear to obey classical mechanics. The typical occupation numbers involved are huge: a macroscopic harmonic oscillator with = 2 Hz, = 10 g, and maximum amplitude 0 = 10 cm, has = , so that ‚âÉ 1030. Further see coherent states. It is less clear, however, how the classical limit applies to chaotic systems, a field known as quantum chaos. Quantum mechanics and classical mechanics are usually treated with entirely different formalisms: quantum theory using Hilbert space, and classical mechanics using a representation in phase space. One can bring the two into a common mathematical framework in various ways. In the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, which is statistical in nature, logical connections between quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics are made, enabling natural comparisons between them, including the violations of Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian) upon quantization. Conversely, in the lesser-known approach presented in 1932 by Koopman and von Neumann, the dynamics of classical mechanics have been formulated in terms of an operational formalism in Hilbert space, a formalism used conventionally for quantum mechanics.  In a crucial paper (1933), Dirac explained how classical mechanics is an emergent phenomenon of quantum mechanics: destructive interference among paths with non-extremal macroscopic actions ¬ª obliterate amplitude contributions in the path integral he introduced, leaving the extremal action class, thus the classical action path as the dominant contribution, an observation further elaborated by Feynman in his 1942 PhD dissertation. :Reproduced in (Further see quantum decoherence.) Time- evolution of expectation values One simple way to compare classical to quantum mechanics is to consider the time-evolution of the expected position and expected momentum, which can then be compared to the time-evolution of the ordinary position and momentum in classical mechanics. The quantum expectation values satisfy the Ehrenfest theorem. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential V, the Ehrenfest theorem says Section 3.7.5 :m\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle x\\\\rangle = \\\\langle p\\\\rangle;\\\\quad \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle p\\\\rangle = -\\\\left\\\\langle V'(X)\\\\right\\\\rangle . Although the first of these equations is consistent with the classical mechanics, the second is not: If the pair (\\\\langle X\\\\rangle,\\\\langle P\\\\rangle) were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have read :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle p\\\\rangle =-V'\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\langle X\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right). But in most cases, :\\\\left\\\\langle V'(X)\\\\right\\\\rangle eq V'(\\\\left\\\\langle X\\\\right\\\\rangle). If for example, the potential V is cubic, then V' is quadratic, in which case, we are talking about the distinction between \\\\langle X^2\\\\rangle and \\\\langle X\\\\rangle^2, which differ by (\\\\Delta X)^2. An exception occurs in case when the classical equations of motion are linear, that is, when V is quadratic and V' is linear. In that special case, V'\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\langle X\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right) and \\\\left\\\\langle V'(X)\\\\right\\\\rangle do agree. In particular, for a free particle or a quantum harmonic oscillator, the expected position and expected momentum exactly follows solutions of Newton's equations. For general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will approximately follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point x_0, then V'\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\langle X\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right) and \\\\left\\\\langle V'(X)\\\\right\\\\rangle will be almost the same, since both will be approximately equal to V'(x_0). In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least for as long as the wave function remains highly localized in position. p. 78 Now, if the initial state is very localized in position, it will be very spread out in momentum, and thus we expect that the wave function will rapidly spread out, and the connection with the classical trajectories will be lost. When Planck's constant is small, however, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in both position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle remains well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories for a long time. Relativity and other deformations Other familiar deformations in physics involve: *The deformation of classical Newtonian into relativistic mechanics (special relativity), with deformation parameter v/c; the classical limit involves small speeds, so v/c‚Üí0, and the systems appear to obey Newtonian mechanics. *Similarly for the deformation of Newtonian gravity into general relativity, with deformation parameter Schwarzschild-radius/characteristic-dimension, we find that objects once again appear to obey classical mechanics (flat space), when the mass of an object times the square of the Planck length is much smaller than its size and the sizes of the problem addressed. See Newtonian limit. *Wave optics might also be regarded as a deformation of ray optics for deformation parameter Œª/a. *Likewise, thermodynamics deforms to statistical mechanics with deformation parameter 1/N.

He lives with his wife, Princess Sofia, and two sons, Prince Alexander and Prince Gabriel, in Villa Solbacken in central Stockholm.  Early life and education  Prince Carl Philip was born on 13 May 1979 at the Stockholm Palace, Sweden. He was baptised at the Royal Chapel on 31 August 1979. His mother is of half German and half Brazilian descent. Carl Philip was heir apparent to the throne of Sweden for seven months, until 1 January 1980 when a change in the constitution came into effect which made natural birth order the basis for succession to the throne, replacing the principle of agnatic primogeniture. His elder sister Victoria became heir apparent, with Carl Philip becoming second in line. During 1984‚Äì1986, Prince Carl Philip attended the V√§sterled parish preschool. In the autumn of 1986, he started school at Smedsl√§ttsskolan in Bromma which he attended at junior level. For the intermediate level, he attended √Ölstensskolan in Bromma, proceeding from there, in the autumn of 1992, to senior level at Enskilda Gymnasiet in Stockholm. In the autumn of 1994, Carl Philip enrolled at Kent School. He then continued his studies in a science programme at Lundsbergs upper secondary school. He graduated in the spring of 1999. In 2007‚Äì2008, he studied graphic design at the Rhode Island School of Design for one year. In 2011, Prince Carl Philip finished his studies in Agricultural and Rural Management at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Alnarp. Carl Philip has dyslexia, as do his father King Carl XVI Gustaf and his sister Crown Princess Victoria. Interests Porsche 911 GT3 Cup Prince Carl Philip has been a scout and is fond of outdoor life. He is keen on sport and athletics, especially football, swimming, sailing and skiing. In 2003, he completed the historic Swedish \\"Vasaloppet\\", the longest cross country ski race in the world. Carl Philip also enjoys car racing, a passion he inherited from his great-uncle and godfather, Prince Bertil, and has a licence to compete. Prince Carl Philip has taken part in the racing series Porsche Carrera Cup Scandinavia in a Porsche 911 GT3. Since 2013 he has raced in the Scandinavian Touring Car Championship. The prince completed his military service at the Amphibious Battalion at Vaxholm Coastal Artillery Regiment as a combat boat commander (Combat Boat 90) in the autumn of 2000. In December 2002, the Prince was promoted to f√§nrik (midshipman), and in 2004 to the rank of l√∂jtnant (sub-lieutenant) in the Swedish Navy. In 2007 and 2008 he went to the Swedish National Defense College. The course was divided in three weeks autumn 2007 and three weeks spring 2008. After that course he was appointed kapten in the Swedish Navy (lieutenant). On 1 October 2014, Prince Carl Philip achieved the rank of major. With a great interest for design and drawing, the prince began studying graphic design in Stockholm in 2003, studies which he continues still.  Activities and charity work  Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia's Foundation was established to mark the occasion of the couple's marriage in 2015. The foundation's purpose is to counteract bullying. In 2013, the Prince Carl Philip Racing Cup was founded. The racing cup aims to help young people with karting talents progress within the sport. The Prince with the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences conducts a range of visits to companies, with focus on the companies‚Äô creative work. Prince Carl Philip is a patron of several organizations such as The Swedish National Dyslexia Association, The Swedish Rural Economy and Agricultural Societies, The International Union for Conservation of Nature, The Royal Swedish Motorboat Club and others. Personal life and family Prince Carl Philip and his wife after their wedding ceremony on 13 June 2015 Prince Carl Philip dated Emma Pernald from 1999 to 2009. Pernald worked at a PR firm for several years. However, the prince and Pernald broke off their relationship in March 2009. She revealed in the Swedish newspaper Expressen that she and the prince mutually decided to go their separate ways. Pernald made no further comment as to the reason for the break-up. In April 2010, Carl Philip was linked in the press with former glamour model Sofia Hellqvist. In August 2010, Royal Court spokesperson Nina Eldh confirmed the relationship between Carl Philip and Hellqvist in a statement released by the palace. On 27 June 2014, it was announced that Carl Philip and Hellqvist were engaged. They married on 13 June 2015 in Stockholm's Royal Palace chapel, and thousands of people lined the streets for the occasion. In an interview he criticized the press for suggesting that Hellqvist was not welcome in the royal family. He told the press that the opposite was true and that his family easily accepted her into the family. He compared the \\"bullying\\" of her past to that of himself being bullied for having dyslexia. On 19 April 2016, Princess Sofia gave birth to a son, Prince Alexander, Duke of S√∂dermanland. Their second child, also a son, was born on 31 August 2017, titled Prince Gabriel, Duke of Dalarna. On 7 October 2019 Carl Philip's father the king issued a statement rescinding the royal status of Prince Alexander and Prince Gabriel in an effort to more strictly associate Swedish royalty to the office of the head of state; they are still to be styled as princes and dukes of their provinces, and they remain in the line of succession to the throne.Swedish communiqu√© of king's decree 2019-10-07 English communiqu√© Carl Philip and his wife commented that their sons now will have more freedom of choice for their future lives.Linda Johansson in Expressen 2019-10-08 p. 17 Titles, styles, and honours=Titles and styles *13 May 1979 ‚Äì 31 December 1979: His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Sweden, Duke of V√§rmland *1 January 1980 ‚Äì Present: His Royal Highness Prince Carl Philip of Sweden, Duke of V√§rmland HonoursNational honours= * : Knight of the Royal Order of the Seraphim (RoKavKMO) * : Commander Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Polar Star (KmstkNO) * : Knight of the Royal Order of Charles XIII (RCXIII:sO) * : Recipient of the Uppland Medal of Merit * : Recipient of the Armed Forces Service Medal * : Recipient of the Defence College Medal, Bronze * : Recipient of the Swedish Military Peace Medal * : Recipient of the 50th Birthday Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf * : Recipient of the Wedding Medal of Crown Princess Victoria to Daniel Westling * : Recipient of the Ruby Jubilee Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf * : Recipient of the 70th Birthday Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf =Foreign honours= * : 1st Class of the Order of Stara Planina * : Grand Cross of the Order of Rio BrancoDECRETO DE 5 DE SETEMBRO DE 2007 - website JusBrasil * : Grand Cross of the Order of Merit * : Member 1st Class of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana * : Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose * : Grand Cross 1st Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany * : Grand Cross of the Order of Honour *: Grand Cross of the Order of the Falcon *: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic * : Grand Cordon of the Order of the Star of Jordan * : Grand Officer of the Order of the Three Stars * : Grand Cross of the Order of Adolphe of Nassau * : Honorary Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia (2005) * : Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav * : Grand Cross of the Order of Faithful ServiceRecipients of Order of Faithful Service (excel file) * : Grand Officer of the Order of Merit Arms Prince Carl Philip's coat of arms is based on the greater coat of arms of Sweden.

Upon her birth, she was third in line of succession to the Swedish throne. She is currently seventh in the line of succession. Princess Madeleine is married to British-American financier Christopher O'Neill. They have three children, Princess Leonore, Prince Nicolas and Princess Adrienne. Early life Madeleine was born on 10 June 1982 at 19:05 CEST at Drottningholm Palace and is a member of the Swedish royal family from the House of Bernadotte. She was christened at The Royal Palace Church on 31 August 1982, her godparents being her father's maternal cousin the Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, her maternal uncle Walther L. Sommerlath, her father's paternal cousin Princess Benedikte of Denmark, and her paternal aunt Princess Christina, Mrs Magnuson. She was given the honorary title of Duchess of H√§lsingland and G√§strikland. It was the first time since the early 17th century (when such titles were still more than honorary) that a Swedish ducal title included more than one province. Education From 1985‚Äì1989, Madeleine began her education at V√§sterled Parish Pre-School. In the autumn of 1989, she entered Smedsl√§ttsskolan in Bromma, attending at the junior level. For the intermediate level, she proceeded to Carlssons School in Stockholm, and then went on to Enskilda Gymnasiet in Stockholm, which she attended at the senior level. She also completed upper secondary school at Enskilda, from which she graduated in 2001. During the autumn of 2001, she lived in London, where she studied English. In the spring of 2002, she took a basic module in Introduction to Swedish Law and studied for the European Computer Driving Licence. In January 2003, she enrolled at the Stockholm University where she began studies in art history. She took 60 Swedish academic units in this subject (two semesters). In the autumn of 2004, she began a course in ethnology at the same university. She speaks English, German and Swedish fluently, and also intermediate-level French. She graduated 23 January 2006 with a Bachelor of Arts in art history, ethnology and modern history. During 2007, she studied child psychology at University of Stockholm. Leisure pursuits Madeleine is an enthusiastic equestrian. She has owned horses (which were stabled at the Royal Stables) and competed in showjumping under the name \\"Anna Svensson\\". She also enjoys skiing, and is interested in theatre, dance and art. In recognition of her age of majority in 2001, a scholarship fund was created in her name by the G√§vleborg province, which comprises her duchies of H√§lsingland and G√§strikland. It encourages and supports young people involved in horse riding. In 2001, Madeleine first distributed such awards as 'Pony Rider of the Year with trainer in G√§vleborg' and 'Gold Rider'. Activities Madeleine handing the G√∂ran Gustafsson Prize to Johan Elf in 2010. Madeleine undertakes various engagements on behalf of her father and the people of Sweden. She participates in the celebrations of Sweden's National Day, the Nobel festivities, dinners and state visits with other members of the royal family. She represented Sweden at the opening of the New Sweden Gallery on 5 June 2011, at the American Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which features an animated map of the New Sweden settlement by Sean Moir. Charity work Madeleine is the patron of the organisation Min Stora Dag (the Swedish equivalent of Make-A-Wish Foundation), more commonly known as My Big Day (its translation into English). She is also affiliated with Europa Nostra, Carl Johan-League and the Royal Motorboat Club. In 2006, she interned for UNICEF for six months in New York City and worked for the division of Child Protective Services. In 2012, she co-founded the ThankYou by Childhood campaign which works to raise awareness of the issues surrounding the sexual abuse of children and the work the World Childhood Foundation does to prevent it. In 2015, the Princess initiated the #EyesWideOpen campaign. It aims to increase the awareness about the sexual abuse of children. In conjunction with a high level meeting in New York in the autumn of 2016, the Princess presented the continuation of the campaign ‚Äì an app that makes it easier for adults to prevent, recognise and react to sexual abuse and exploitation of children. The app is a collaboration between the World Childhood Foundation, Darkness to Light and Ericsson. In February 2017, Princess Madeleine announced she was writing a children's book during a visit to London's Southbank Centre. On 28 January 2019, the Princess shared the book's title and cover via Instagram. She wrote: \\"I'm very excited to finally share with you a book which will hopefully show children how important it is to stand up for themselves and to tell someone when something doesn't feel right.\\" The book titled Stella och hemligheten was published in support of the World Childhood Foundation and was released on 4 June 2019.https://theroyalnovelist.blogspot.com/2019/01/stella-och-hemligheten-by- princess.html Personal life=Broken-off engagement On 11 August 2009, Madeleine announced her engagement to lawyer Jonas Bergstr√∂m (b. 1979). Madeleine said in her engagement interview that they became engaged in Capri in early June 2009. An engagement dinner took place on the engagement day in Solliden Palace on √ñland. The engagement could only take place after Bergstr√∂m had been awarded the official approval of the Swedish Cabinet Regeringen and that had been communicated to her father, the King. The wedding was originally due to take place in the second half of 2010 but was postponed due to \\"many things happening in an intense period of time\\", mainly her sister Victoria's wedding in June. Queen Silvia denied the rumoured relationship issues. However, media reporting of the relationship issues escalated, and on 24 April 2010 it was announced that the wedding would not go ahead, and the engagement was broken off.  Marriage and children  Princess Madeleine and Christopher O'Neill following their wedding. After her relationship with Bergstr√∂m ended, Madeleine moved to New York City, where she worked for the World Childhood Foundation, the organisation that her mother co-founded. On 25 October 2012, the Swedish Royal Court announced her engagement with the British-born American financier Christopher O'Neill. On 23 December 2012, it was announced that the wedding would take place on 8 June 2013, at the Royal Palace chapel in Stockholm. O'Neill chose to remain untitled: a member of the Swedish royal family must hold Swedish citizenship which O'Neill declined. The couple's first child Princess Leonore was born in New York City on 20 February 2014. Prior to the birth, Madeleine had announced on her Facebook page that she would be unable to travel to Stockholm for the Nobel Prize ceremony due to her pregnancy and also mentioned that she was expecting a girl. Their second child, and their son, Prince Nicolas, was born in Stockholm on 15 June 2015. In February 2015, the Swedish Royal Court announced that the family had moved to Stockholm from New York. In May 2015, the Swedish Royal Court announced that O'Neill had moved to London in April. In Autumn 2015, several months after the birth of Prince Nicolas, the entire family moved to London, where O'Neill's business is located. On 9 March 2018, Princess Madeleine gave birth to their third child, Princess Adrienne, at Danderyd Hospital. In August 2018, the Swedish Royal Court announced that the princess and her family were to move to Florida. On 7 October 2019 Madeleine's father the king issued a statement rescinding the royal status of her three children in an effort to more strictly associate Swedish royalty to the office of the head of state; they are still to be styled as princesses and prince, as well as duchesses and duke of their provinces, and they remain in the line of succession to the throne.Swedish communiqu√© of king's decree 2019-10-07 English communiqu√© Madeleine commented that her children now will have greater possibilities to format their own lives as private persons.Linda Johansson in Expressen 2019-10-08 p. 17 Title, styles and honours=Title Madeleine is styled as: Her Royal Highness Princess Madeleine of Sweden, Duchess of H√§lsingland and G√§strikland.

Armstrong, when major doctrinal changes (causing turmoil and divisions) were occurring in the former Worldwide Church of God (WCG) during the 1990s. It was after its founder, the late Roderick C. Meredith, was fired by Board members of the Global Church of God (GCG), that he went on to found, for a second time, a new organisation in 1998. It is just one of many and varied Sabbatarian Churches of God groups that have sprung up from the former Worldwide Church of God, known today as Grace Communion International (GCI). The US membership of LCG is around 11,300 with about 5,000 international members. From the LCG organization, several additional split-off groups have resulted over the years, each one headed by a former LCG minister. Founder LCG's founder and Presiding Evangelist was, until his death, Dr. Roderick C. Meredith (June 21, 1930 ‚Äì May 18, 2017). Following Meredith's graduation from Ambassador College in Pasadena, California in June 1952, he was assigned by Herbert W. Armstrong (Pastor General of the Worldwide Church of God) to set up and pastor WCG congregations in Portland, Oregon; San Diego, California; and Seattle and Tacoma, Washington. On December 20, 1952, after summoning him back to the WCG's headquarters in Pasadena, California, from his pastorship in Oregon, Armstrong ordained him and four other men ‚Äî including his uncle Dr. C. Paul Meredith ‚Äî to the position of Evangelist. These men were the very first Evangelists of the WCG. Meredith was the youngest of the newly ordained men and the fifth to be ordained. In the subsequent years, Meredith would help start scores of WCG congregations throughout the United States. He would also conduct many baptizing and evangelizing tours in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Africa. From the early to mid-1950s, and again in 1960, he was assigned by Armstrong to live in Britain to form congregations for the Church there. For years he was one of the WCG's leading theologians and top executives, and an instructor at Ambassador College. However, when overseeing the ministry during the 1960s, he began to gain a reputation for being too strict in his application of Church rules and regulations. LCG's Presiding Evangelist Due to declining health, in 2016 (aged 86), Dr. Meredith appointed Evangelist Gerald E. Weston as his successor and as President of LCG. Mr. Weston has served congregations throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe. He has been a frequent writer for the Church's publications, and has trained many ministers over the years. He has been a long time member of the Church's Council of Elders. Upon Dr. Meredith's death in May 2017, Mr. Weston became LCG's Presiding Evangelist. Formation After Armstrong died, WCG began to change many of its core doctrines; a process that brought the organization into the mainstream of Evangelical Christianity. However, many members objected and hundreds of splinter groups arose as a result. Meredith initially founded the Global Church of God (GCG) in December 1992, but due to a board coup d'√©tat, was controversially fired from his positions as Chairman of the Board and Presiding Evangelist in 1998. He then formed LCG, incorporating the church in San Diego, California, in December 1998. His dismissal was unpopular with GCG members, with as much as 80 percent of the GCG membership following Meredith to the newly formed LCG. In 2004, the late Evangelist Raymond F. McNair (ordained by Herbert W. Armstrong in 1953, a year after Meredith's ordination) left LCG to start The Church of God 21st Century. (It disbanded after his death in 2008.) In 2005, ministers Don Haney and Ben Faulkner also left. Haney formed Church of God In Peace and Truth, and Faulkner formed Church of the Sovereign God. In 2006, Charles Bryce (whom Meredith had appointed head of Church administration) left and formed Enduring Church of God. In late 2012, member Bob Thiel left and formed the Continuing Church of God.Cartwright, D. The Journal: News of the Churches of God, January 31, 2013 In 2013, minister Rod Reynolds left and formed COG Messenger. In 2003, the church's corporate headquarters were moved from San Diego to Charlotte, North Carolina. The church reported in 2011 that it had 330 congregations in 45 countries, and that over 8,000 members attended its annual eight-day festival of the Feast of Tabernacles and Last Great Day, at 46 sites in 31 countries on every continent (except Antarctica). An independent auditor specializing in non-profits reported that the church's income for 2010 was over US$14.3 million. LCG's revenue comes from tithes, holy day offerings, and other contributions from both members and non-members. The tithe is 10% of a member's income and it is permitted to tithe on the net income. The members should not tithe on \\"unearned income\\" (such as Social Security, old-age assistance, unemployment benefits, pensions, gifts, disability, or similar types of income). Doctrines LCG believes that the Bible is God's inspired revelation to mankind, and as such is complete and inerrant in its original form. The Church has a three-fold mission: 1. To preach the true Gospel of the Kingdom of God (Mark 1:14; Matthew 24:14; Ezekiel 3 and 33), and the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 8:12) to all nations as a witness. 2. To feed the flock and to organize local Church congregations to provide for the spiritual and material needs of our members as God makes it possible (1 Peter 5:1-4; John 21:15-18). 3. To preach the end-time prophecies and to warn the English- speaking nations and all the world of the coming Great Tribulation (Matthew 24:21). Other beliefs include: *Binitarianism: The belief that there are two God Beings representing a God family rather than one God with multiple personalities (Godhead). These two separate personalities consist of God the Father and God the Son (also called The Word). The Holy Spirit is not a Being, and is considered the very essence, the mind, life, breath, and power of God. Much in the same way the physical world is made of matter, the spiritual world is made of Spirit. *Non-partisanism: Generally, members should not take part in politics, juries, voting, swearing oaths (members can only \\"affirm\\", not swear, in court), or military service. or *British Israelism: The belief that the Anglo-American people are descended from the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel, specifically Ephraim and Manasseh and are the possessors of the birthright promises and accompanying blessings of Abraham's descendants, through his grandson Jacob. Other countries believed to be Israelite are Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Belgium, France, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Denmark. *Many laws revealed in the Hebrew Scriptures should still be adhered to by Christians today, including the clean and unclean foods, mentioned in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14:3‚Äì21, delineating which animals may be eaten. This was also a practice of the first-century Church (see Acts 10:14). *Christians should observe the biblical seventh-day Sabbath. According to the biblical definition, a day is measured from sunset to sunset, and therefore the Sabbath begins at sunset on Friday, and ends at sunset on Saturday. No business is to be conducted or paid physical labor performed during this time period, nor any personal activities that take away from worship and family time. These include entertainment, such as participating in sporting events (for example, high school football), going to the movies, theater, dance hall, or bar, and watching non-religious movies or television, except news. Feeding livestock and cooking for family members are allowed. The Sabbath is viewed as holy, and set apart by God at creation (Genesis 2:2‚Äì3), and is a sign between God and his believers (Exodus 31:13). *Annual festivals listed in Leviticus 23 and Deuteronomy 16 should be observed by Christians today as they were kept by Jesus, the original apostles, and the first-century Church of God, headquartered at Jerusalem. Members do not celebrate Christmas, Easter, saints' days, Lent, or other traditional Catholic or Christian holy days that were adopted by the Catholic Church (and some Protestant denominations) later in history. Regarding birthday celebrations, while many members do not participate in large birthday parties, a family meal or a day out is often substituted to celebrate and give thanks for another year of life. Media projects Shortly after LCG's incorporation, it started producing a weekly, half-hour television program: Tomorrow's World. It is carried on 211 television stations throughout the world. In May 2006, LCG's media department reported that the show was accessible to nearly 78 million American households, or 71 percent of the American television market. According to reports in March 2007 by Nielsen Research, the program was estimated to reach an average of 50,000 new viewers each week.Living Church of God, Letter from Roderick C. Meredith, March 13, 2007 From 1999 to date, approximately 320 programs have been taped and televised. LCG also publishes a free, bi-monthly, subscription magazine titledTomorrow's World. Circulation figures (July 2017), were 282,000 issues. From the magazine's inception in 1999 through to May 2007, 8.3 million copies were produced.Greetings, Douglas Winnail, May 24, 2007 Additionally, the church operates a Tomorrow's World website.The Living Church News, v.4 No.9, July‚ÄìAugust 2007, p9 The church produces several foreign-language radio programs, which are broadcast on 15 stations. These include a Spanish program titled El Mundo de Ma√±ana (\\"Tomorrow's World\\"),Programas de El Mundio de Ma√±ana presented by Mario Hernandez, who also is the presenter of the Spanish telecast with the same title. Also, the French program Le Monde Demain (\\"Tomorrow's World\\") is broadcast throughout the Caribbean. Up until his death in 2010, it was presented by longtime evangelist and radio presenter Dibar K. Apartian. Former online college On February 27, 2007, LCG launched Living University, a nonprofit, online (distance-learning) institution. LCG explored accreditation for Living University's undergraduate degrees, diplomas, and certificates,Co-Worker Letter Library February 13, 2007 but Living University was never accredited by any agency recognized by the United States Department of Education. More and more states were blocking non-accredited colleges and universities from offering classes within their borders, so it was decided to close Living University. Living University closed on May 14, 2018, after final commencement exercises for 30 students present. In August 2018, LCG introduced a new program \\"Living Education\\". Mass shooting by Terry Ratzmann On March 12, 2005, the LCG was thrust into national and international spotlight when member Terry Ratzmann (aged 44) shot at his brethren congregated for church services at the Sheraton Hotel in Brookfield, Wisconsin. It was one of the worst mass shootings in the state's history. Ratzmann killed eight, including his pastor, his pastor's son, and himself. No conclusive motive for the mass murder was reached, though police investigated religious issues as potential motives for the shooting Suicide of minister Beyersdorfer \\"A popular elder and former pastor of the Living Church of God, Karl Beyersdorfer, 73, took his own life May 27, 2016, at his home in Joplin, Mo.\\" He committed suicide just days before his fiftieth wedding anniversary. Depression is thought to have been a factor. A 1966 graduate of Ambassador College, Karl had been an ordained minister for 49 years ministering in the Worldwide Church of God, and then joined Meredith in Global, and then followed him again to the LCG (1998).

The taxonomy of this species has been debated. At the higher level, some authors place the towhees in the family Fringillidae. Within the group, there has been debate about whether the distinction between this species and the similar canyon towhee (Melozone fuscus) should be at the specific or subspecific level. The two populations are quite isolated from each other, and molecular genetics seems to have settled the matter in favour of two distinct species for the present. On the other hand, there seems to be little distinction between the northern and Baja Californian populations within M. crissalis. Appearance The California towhee's coloring is dull brown overall with light rust undertail covert feathers and buff or rust-colored streaks at the throat. There is little sexual dimorphism.

However, its skulking habits combined with its nondescript appearance mean that it is not one of the better known garden birds even though it is regularly drawn to feeding stations. Nests are typically found in low branches or shrubs about above ground. The nest is a bulky cup made of twigs, stems, grasses, and hair. Behavior The California towhee feeds on the ground or in low scrub where it prefers a variety of seeds and some insects. It is most often seen traveling or feeding singly or in pairs. The call consists of a single-note sound that different people hear as ', ', ', ' or ' and the song consists of a long repeating series ended with a trill. The female incubates the nest of 2 to 4 eggs alone for 11 days. Eggs are laid from March through September with shells that are slightly glossy and pale bluish white with some brownish flecks concentrated mostly on the larger end. Young leave the nest after 8 days.

Epstein, was an American geneticist who in 1952, with Alfred Hershey, experimentally helped to confirm that DNA rather than protein is the genetic material of life. Early life and college education Chase was born in 1927 in Cleveland, Ohio,She received a bachelor's degree from the College of Wooster in 1950, then worked as a research assistant before returning to school in 1959 and receiving a PhD in Microbiology from the University of Southern California in 1964. Research and later life In 1950, Chase began working as a research assistant at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in the laboratory of bacteriologist and geneticist Alfred Hershey. In 1952, she and Hershey performed the Hershey‚ÄìChase experiment, which helped to confirm that genetic information is held and transmitted by DNA, not by protein. The experiment involved radioactively labeling either protein or nucleic acid of the bacteriophage T2 (a virus that infects bacteria) and seeing which component entered E coli upon infection. They found that nucleic acids but not protein were transferred, helping resolve controversy over the composition of hereditary information. Hershey won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery in 1969, but Chase was not included. Chase left Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1953 and worked with Gus Doermann at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, and later at the University of Rochester. Throughout the 1950s, she returned yearly to Cold Spring Harbor to take part in meetings of the Phage Group of biologists. In 1959, she began doctoral studies at University of Southern California in the laboratory of Giuseppe Bertani. Bertani moved to Sweden and Chase finished her thesis with Margaret Lieb in 1964. While in California, Chase met and married fellow scientist Richard Epstein in the late 1950s and changed her name to Martha C. Epstein. The marriage was brief and they divorced shortly after with no children. A series of personal setbacks through the 1960s ended her career in science. She moved back to Ohio to live with family and spent the last decades of her life suffering from a form of dementia that robbed her of short-term memory. She died of pneumonia on August 8, 2003, at the age of 75. Key paper *Hershey, A. D. and Martha Chase. \\"Independent Functions of Viral Protein and Nucleic Acid in Growth of Bacteriophage.\\" J.

A small change in the input (in the word \\"over\\") drastically changes the output (digest). This is the so-called avalanche effect. A cryptographic hash function (CHF) is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size (often called the \\"message\\") to a bit array of a fixed size (the \\"hash value\\", \\"hash\\", or \\"message digest\\"). It is a one-way function, that is, a function which is practically infeasible to invert. Ideally, the only way to find a message that produces a given hash is to attempt a brute-force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match, or use a rainbow table of matched hashes. Cryptographic hash functions are a basic tool of modern cryptography. The ideal cryptographic hash function has the following main properties: * it is deterministic, meaning that the same message always results in the same hash * it is quick to compute the hash value for any given message * it is infeasible to generate a message that yields a given hash value (i.e. to reverse the process that generated the given hash value) * it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value * a small change to a message should change the hash value so extensively that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value (avalanche effect) Cryptographic hash functions have many information-security applications, notably in digital signatures, message authentication codes (MACs), and other forms of authentication. They can also be used as ordinary hash functions, to index data in hash tables, for fingerprinting, to detect duplicate data or uniquely identify files, and as checksums to detect accidental data corruption. Indeed, in information-security contexts, cryptographic hash values are sometimes called (digital) fingerprints, checksums, or just hash values, even though all these terms stand for more general functions with rather different properties and purposes. Properties Most cryptographic hash functions are designed to take a string of any length as input and produce a fixed-length hash value. A cryptographic hash function must be able to withstand all known types of cryptanalytic attack. In theoretical cryptography, the security level of a cryptographic hash function has been defined using the following properties: * Pre-image resistance *: Given a hash value h it should be difficult to find any message m such that . This concept is related to that of a one-way function. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to preimage attacks. * Second pre-image resistance *: Given an input m1, it should be difficult to find a different input m2 such that . This property is sometimes referred to as weak collision resistance. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to second-preimage attacks. * Collision resistance *: It should be difficult to find two different messages m1 and m2 such that . Such a pair is called a cryptographic hash collision. This property is sometimes referred to as strong collision resistance. It requires a hash value at least twice as long as that required for pre-image resistance; otherwise collisions may be found by a birthday attack. Collision resistance implies second pre-image resistance, but does not imply pre-image resistance. The weaker assumption is always preferred in theoretical cryptography, but in practice, a hash-function which is only second pre-image resistant is considered insecure and is therefore not recommended for real applications. Informally, these properties mean that a malicious adversary cannot replace or modify the input data without changing its digest. Thus, if two strings have the same digest, one can be very confident that they are identical. Second pre-image resistance prevents an attacker from crafting a document with the same hash as a document the attacker cannot control. Collision resistance prevents an attacker from creating two distinct documents with the same hash. A function meeting these criteria may still have undesirable properties. Currently popular cryptographic hash functions are vulnerable to length-extension attacks: given and but not m, by choosing a suitable an attacker can calculate , where ‚à• denotes concatenation. This property can be used to break naive authentication schemes based on hash functions. The HMAC construction works around these problems. In practice, collision resistance is insufficient for many practical uses. In addition to collision resistance, it should be impossible for an adversary to find two messages with substantially similar digests; or to infer any useful information about the data, given only its digest. In particular, a hash function should behave as much as possible like a random function (often called a random oracle in proofs of security) while still being deterministic and efficiently computable. This rules out functions like the SWIFFT function, which can be rigorously proven to be collision resistant assuming that certain problems on ideal lattices are computationally difficult, but as a linear function, does not satisfy these additional properties. Checksum algorithms, such as CRC32 and other cyclic redundancy checks, are designed to meet much weaker requirements, and are generally unsuitable as cryptographic hash functions. For example, a CRC was used for message integrity in the WEP encryption standard, but an attack was readily discovered which exploited the linearity of the checksum. Degree of difficulty In cryptographic practice, \\"difficult\\" generally means \\"almost certainly beyond the reach of any adversary who must be prevented from breaking the system for as long as the security of the system is deemed important\\". The meaning of the term is therefore somewhat dependent on the application since the effort that a malicious agent may put into the task is usually proportional to his expected gain. However, since the needed effort usually multiplies with the digest length, even a thousand-fold advantage in processing power can be neutralized by adding a few dozen bits to the latter. For messages selected from a limited set of messages, for example passwords or other short messages, it can be feasible to invert a hash by trying all possible messages in the set. Because cryptographic hash functions are typically designed to be computed quickly, special key derivation functions that require greater computing resources have been developed that make such brute force attacks more difficult. In some theoretical analyses \\"difficult\\" has a specific mathematical meaning, such as \\"not solvable in asymptotic polynomial time\\". Such interpretations of difficulty are important in the study of provably secure cryptographic hash functions but do not usually have a strong connection to practical security. For example, an exponential time algorithm can sometimes still be fast enough to make a feasible attack. Conversely, a polynomial time algorithm (e.g., one that requires n20 steps for n-digit keys) may be too slow for any practical use. Illustration An illustration of the potential use of a cryptographic hash is as follows: Alice poses a tough math problem to Bob and claims that she has solved it. Bob would like to try it himself, but would yet like to be sure that Alice is not bluffing. Therefore, Alice writes down her solution, computes its hash and tells Bob the hash value (whilst keeping the solution secret). Then, when Bob comes up with the solution himself a few days later, Alice can prove that she had the solution earlier by revealing it and having Bob hash it and check that it matches the hash value given to him before. (This is an example of a simple commitment scheme; in actual practice, Alice and Bob will often be computer programs, and the secret would be something less easily spoofed than a claimed puzzle solution.) Applications=Verifying the integrity of messages and files An important application of secure hashes is verification of message integrity. Comparing message digests (hash digests over the message) calculated before, and after, transmission can determine whether any changes have been made to the message or file. MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-2 hash digests are sometimes published on websites or forums to allow verification of integrity for downloaded files, including files retrieved using file sharing such as mirroring. This practice establishes a chain of trust as long as the hashes are posted on a trusted site - usually the originating site - authenticated by HTTPS. Using a cryptographic hash and a chain of trust detects malicious changes to the file. Other error detecting codes such as cyclic redundancy checks only prevent against non-malicious alterations of the file. Signature generation and verification Almost all digital signature schemes require a cryptographic hash to be calculated over the message. This allows the signature calculation to be performed on the relatively small, statically sized hash digest. The message is considered authentic if the signature verification succeeds given the signature and recalculated hash digest over the message. So the message integrity property of the cryptographic hash is used to create secure and efficient digital signature schemes. Password verification Password verification commonly relies on cryptographic hashes. Storing all user passwords as cleartext can result in a massive security breach if the password file is compromised. One way to reduce this danger is to only store the hash digest of each password. To authenticate a user, the password presented by the user is hashed and compared with the stored hash. A password reset method is required when password hashing is performed; original passwords cannot be recalculated from the stored hash value. Standard cryptographic hash functions are designed to be computed quickly, and, as a result, it is possible to try guessed passwords at high rates. Common graphics processing units can try billions of possible passwords each second. Password hash functions that perform key stretching ‚Äì such as PBKDF2, scrypt or Argon2 ‚Äì commonly use repeated invocations of a cryptographic hash to increase the time (and in some cases computer memory) required to perform brute force attacks on stored password hash digests. A password hash requires the use of a large random, non-secret salt value which can be stored with the password hash. The salt randomizes the output of the password hash, making it impossible for an adversary to store tables of passwords and precomputed hash values to which the password hash digest can be compared. The output of a password hash function can also be used as a cryptographic key. Password hashes are therefore also known as password-based key derivation functions (PBKDFs). Proof-of-work A proof-of-work system (or protocol, or function) is an economic measure to deter denial-of-service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. A key feature of these schemes is their asymmetry: the work must be moderately hard (but feasible) on the requester side but easy to check for the service provider. One popular system ‚Äì used in Bitcoin mining and Hashcash ‚Äì uses partial hash inversions to prove that work was done, to unlock a mining reward in Bitcoin and as a good-will token to send an e-mail in Hashcash. The sender is required to find a message whose hash value begins with a number of zero bits. The average work that sender needs to perform in order to find a valid message is exponential in the number of zero bits required in the hash value, while the recipient can verify the validity of the message by executing a single hash function. For instance, in Hashcash, a sender is asked to generate a header whose 160 bit SHA-1 hash value has the first 20 bits as zeros. The sender will on average have to try 219 times to find a valid header. File or data identifier A message digest can also serve as a means of reliably identifying a file; several source code management systems, including Git, Mercurial and Monotone, use the sha1sum of various types of content (file content, directory trees, ancestry information, etc.) to uniquely identify them. Hashes are used to identify files on peer-to-peer filesharing networks. For example, in an ed2k link, an MD4-variant hash is combined with the file size, providing sufficient information for locating file sources, downloading the file and verifying its contents. Magnet links are another example. Such file hashes are often the top hash of a hash list or a hash tree which allows for additional benefits. One of the main applications of a hash function is to allow the fast look-up of a data in a hash table. Being hash functions of a particular kind, cryptographic hash functions lend themselves well to this application too. However, compared with standard hash functions, cryptographic hash functions tend to be much more expensive computationally. For this reason, they tend to be used in contexts where it is necessary for users to protect themselves against the possibility of forgery (the creation of data with the same digest as the expected data) by potentially malicious participants. Hash functions based on block ciphers There are several methods to use a block cipher to build a cryptographic hash function, specifically a one-way compression function. The methods resemble the block cipher modes of operation usually used for encryption. Many well-known hash functions, including MD4, MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-2 are built from block-cipher-like components designed for the purpose, with feedback to ensure that the resulting function is not invertible. SHA-3 finalists included functions with block-cipher-like components (e.g., Skein, BLAKE) though the function finally selected, Keccak, was built on a cryptographic sponge instead. A standard block cipher such as AES can be used in place of these custom block ciphers; that might be useful when an embedded system needs to implement both encryption and hashing with minimal code size or hardware area. However, that approach can have costs in efficiency and security. The ciphers in hash functions are built for hashing: they use large keys and blocks, can efficiently change keys every block, and have been designed and vetted for resistance to related-key attacks. General-purpose ciphers tend to have different design goals. In particular, AES has key and block sizes that make it nontrivial to use to generate long hash values; AES encryption becomes less efficient when the key changes each block; and related-key attacks make it potentially less secure for use in a hash function than for encryption.  Hash function design =Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction The Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd hash construction. A hash function must be able to process an arbitrary-length message into a fixed-length output. This can be achieved by breaking the input up into a series of equal-sized blocks, and operating on them in sequence using a one-way compression function. The compression function can either be specially designed for hashing or be built from a block cipher. A hash function built with the Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction is as resistant to collisions as is its compression function; any collision for the full hash function can be traced back to a collision in the compression function. The last block processed should also be unambiguously length padded; this is crucial to the security of this construction. This construction is called the Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction. Most common classical hash functions, including SHA-1 and MD5, take this form.  Wide pipe versus narrow pipe  A straightforward application of the Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction, where the size of hash output is equal to the internal state size (between each compression step), results in a narrow-pipe hash design. This design causes many inherent flaws, including length-extension, multicollisions, long message attacks, generate-and-paste attacks, and also cannot be parallelized. As a result, modern hash functions are built on wide- pipe constructions that have a larger internal state size ‚Äì which range from tweaks of the Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction to new constructions such as the sponge construction and HAIFA construction. None of the entrants in the NIST hash function competition use a classical Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction. Meanwhile, truncating the output of a longer hash, such as used in SHA-512/256, also defeats many of these attacks. Use in building other cryptographic primitives Hash functions can be used to build other cryptographic primitives. For these other primitives to be cryptographically secure, care must be taken to build them correctly. Message authentication codes (MACs) (also called keyed hash functions) are often built from hash functions. HMAC is such a MAC. Just as block ciphers can be used to build hash functions, hash functions can be used to build block ciphers. Luby-Rackoff constructions using hash functions can be provably secure if the underlying hash function is secure. Also, many hash functions (including SHA-1 and SHA-2) are built by using a special-purpose block cipher in a Davies‚ÄìMeyer or other construction. That cipher can also be used in a conventional mode of operation, without the same security guarantees. See SHACAL, BEAR and LION. Pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) can be built using hash functions. This is done by combining a (secret) random seed with a counter and hashing it. Some hash functions, such as Skein, Keccak, and RadioGat√∫n output an arbitrarily long stream and can be used as a stream cipher, and stream ciphers can also be built from fixed-length digest hash functions. Often this is done by first building a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator and then using its stream of random bytes as keystream. SEAL is a stream cipher that uses SHA-1 to generate internal tables, which are then used in a keystream generator more or less unrelated to the hash algorithm. SEAL is not guaranteed to be as strong (or weak) as SHA-1. Similarly, the key expansion of the HC-128 and HC-256 stream ciphers makes heavy use of the SHA-256 hash function. Concatenation Concatenating outputs from multiple hash functions provides collision resistance as good as the strongest of the algorithms included in the concatenated result. For example, older versions of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) used concatenated MD5 and SHA-1 sums. This ensures that a method to find collisions in one of the hash functions does not defeat data protected by both hash functions. For Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction hash functions, the concatenated function is as collision-resistant as its strongest component, but not more collision- resistant. Antoine Joux observed that 2-collisions lead to n-collisions: if it is feasible for an attacker to find two messages with the same MD5 hash, the attacker can find as many messages as the attacker desires with identical MD5 hashes with no greater difficulty. Among the n messages with the same MD5 hash, there is likely to be a collision in SHA-1. The additional work needed to find the SHA-1 collision (beyond the exponential birthday search) requires only polynomial time. Cryptographic hash algorithms There are many cryptographic hash algorithms; this section lists a few algorithms that are referenced relatively often. A more extensive list can be found on the page containing a comparison of cryptographic hash functions. MD5 MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4, and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321. Collisions against MD5 can be calculated within seconds which makes the algorithm unsuitable for most use cases where a cryptographic hash is required. MD5 produces a digest of 128 bits (16 bytes). SHA-1 SHA-1 was developed as part of the U.S. Government's Capstone project. The original specification ‚Äì now commonly called SHA-0 ‚Äì of the algorithm was published in 1993 under the title Secure Hash Standard, FIPS PUB 180, by U.S. government standards agency NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). It was withdrawn by the NSA shortly after publication and was superseded by the revised version, published in 1995 in FIPS PUB 180-1 and commonly designated SHA-1. Collisions against the full SHA-1 algorithm can be produced using the shattered attack and the hash function should be considered broken. SHA-1 produces a hash digest of 160 bits (20 bytes). Documents may refer to SHA-1 as just \\"SHA\\", even though this may conflict with the other Standard Hash Algorithms such as SHA-0, SHA-2 and SHA-3. RIPEMD-160 RIPEMD (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest) is a family of cryptographic hash functions developed in Leuven, Belgium, by Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers and Bart Preneel at the COSIC research group at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, and first published in 1996. RIPEMD was based upon the design principles used in MD4, and is similar in performance to the more popular SHA-1. RIPEMD-160 has however not been broken. As the name implies, RIPEMD-160 produces a hash digest of 160 bits (20 bytes). Whirlpool Whirlpool is a cryptographic hash function designed by Vincent Rijmen and Paulo S. L. M. Barreto, who first described it in 2000. Whirlpool is based on a substantially modified version of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Whirlpool produces a hash digest of 512 bits (64 bytes). SHA-2 SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA), first published in 2001. They are built using the Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd structure, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Davies‚ÄìMeyer structure from a (classified) specialized block cipher. SHA-2 basically consists of two hash algorithms: SHA-256 and SHA-512. SHA-224 is a variant of SHA-256 with different starting values and truncated output. SHA-384 and the lesser known SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are all variants of SHA-512. SHA-512 is more secure than SHA-256 and is commonly faster than SHA-256 on 64 bit machines such as AMD64. The output size in bits is given by the extension to the \\"SHA\\" name, so SHA-224 has an output size of 224 bits (28 bytes), SHA-256 produces 32 bytes, SHA-384 produces 48 bytes and finally SHA-512 produces 64 bytes. SHA-3 SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3) was released by NIST on August 5, 2015. SHA-3 is a subset of the broader cryptographic primitive family Keccak. The Keccak algorithm is the work of Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Michael Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche. Keccak is based on a sponge construction which can also be used to build other cryptographic primitives such as a stream cipher. SHA-3 provides the same output sizes as SHA-2: 224, 256, 384 and 512 bits. Configurable output sizes can also be obtained using the SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 functions. Here the -128 and -256 extensions to the name imply the security strength of the function rather than the output size in bits. BLAKE2 An improved version of BLAKE called BLAKE2 was announced on December 21, 2012. It was created by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, and Christian Winnerlein with the goal of replacing the widely used but broken MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms. When run on 64-bit x64 and ARM architectures, BLAKE2b is faster than SHA-3, SHA-2, SHA-1, and MD5. Although BLAKE and BLAKE2 have not been standardized as SHA-3 has, BLAKE2 has been used in many protocols including the Argon2 password hash, for the high efficiency that it offers on modern CPUs. As BLAKE was a candidate for SHA-3, BLAKE and BLAKE2 both offer the same output sizes as SHA-3 ‚Äì including a configurable output size. BLAKE3 BLAKE3, an improved version of BLAKE2, was announced on January 9, 2020. It was created by Jack O'Connor, Jean- Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, and Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn. BLAKE3 is a single algorithm, in contrast to BLAKE and BLAKE2, which are algorithm families with multiple variants. The BLAKE3 compression function is closely based on that of BLAKE2s, with the biggest difference being that the number of rounds is reduced from 10 to 7. Internally, BLAKE3 is a Merkle tree, and it supports higher degrees of parallelism than BLAKE2. Attacks on cryptographic hash algorithms There is a long list of cryptographic hash functions but many have been found to be vulnerable and should not be used. For instance, NIST selected 51 hash functionsAndrew Regenscheid, Ray Perlner, Shu-jen Chang, John Kelsey, Mridul Nandi, Souradyuti Paul, Status Report on the First Round of the SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition as candidates for round 1 of the SHA-3 hash competition, of which 10 were considered broken and 16 showed significant weaknesses and therefore didn't make it to the next round; more information can be found on the main article about the NIST hash function competitions. Even if a hash function has never been broken, a successful attack against a weakened variant may undermine the experts' confidence. For instance, in August 2004 collisions were found in several then-popular hash functions, including MD5.XiaoyunWang, Dengguo Feng, Xuejia Lai, Hongbo Yu, Collisions for Hash Functions MD4, MD5, HAVAL-128 and RIPEMD These weaknesses called into question the security of stronger algorithms derived from the weak hash functions‚Äîin particular, SHA-1 (a strengthened version of SHA-0), RIPEMD-128, and RIPEMD-160 (both strengthened versions of RIPEMD). On 12 August 2004, Joux, Carribault, Lemuet, and Jalby announced a collision for the full SHA-0 algorithm. Joux et al. accomplished this using a generalization of the Chabaud and Joux attack. They found that the collision had complexity 251 and took about 80,000 CPU hours on a supercomputer with 256 Itanium 2 processors‚Äîequivalent to 13 days of full-time use of the supercomputer. In February 2005, an attack on SHA-1 was reported that would find collision in about 269 hashing operations, rather than the 280 expected for a 160-bit hash function. In August 2005, another attack on SHA-1 was reported that would find collisions in 263 operations. Other theoretical weaknesses of SHA-1 have been known:Xiaoyun Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu, Finding Collisions in the Full SHA-1Bruce Schneier, Cryptanalysis of SHA-1 (summarizes Wang et al. results and their implications) and in February 2017 Google announced a collision in SHA-1. Security researchers recommend that new applications can avoid these problems by using later members of the SHA family, such as SHA-2, or using techniques such as randomized hashingShai Halevi, Hugo Krawczyk, Update on Randomized HashingShai Halevi and Hugo Krawczyk, Randomized Hashing and Digital Signatures that do not require collision resistance. A successful, practical attack broke MD5 used within certificates for Transport Layer Security in 2008.Alexander Sotirov, Marc Stevens, Jacob Appelbaum, Arjen Lenstra, David Molnar, Dag Arne Osvik, Benne de Weger, MD5 considered harmful today: Creating a rogue CA certificate, accessed March 29, 2009. Many cryptographic hashes are based on the Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction. All cryptographic hashes that directly use the full output of a Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction are vulnerable to length extension attacks. This makes the MD5, SHA-1, RIPEMD-160, Whirlpool and the SHA-256 / SHA-512 hash algorithms all vulnerable to this specific attack. SHA-3, BLAKE2, BLAKE3, and the truncated SHA-2 variants are not vulnerable to this type of attack.

Freundlich was a working associate of Albert Einstein and introduced experiments for which the general theory of relativity could be tested by astronomical observations based on the gravitational redshift. Life He was born in Biebrich, Germany the son of Friedrich Philipp Ernst Freundlich, a manufacturer, and his wife Elizabeth (Ellie) Finlayson. He was one of seven children, all of whom were raised Protestant, despite their father's Jewish heritage. His elder brother was Herbert Max Finlay Freundlich. He studied locally, leaving school in 1903. He spent 6 months working in the shipyards of Stettin which inspired him to begin studying shipbuilding at the Charlottenburg Polytechnic in Berlin. However he abandoned this in autumn 1905 to instead study Mathematics and Astronomy at G√∂ttingen. Here he studied under Felix Klein and Karl Schwarzschild.The Einstein Tower by Klaus Hentschel In 1913 he married Kate Hirschberg. After finishing his thesis under the direction of Paul Koebe at the University of G√∂ttingen in 1910 and gaining his doctorate (PhD), he became assistant at the Observatory in Berlin, where he became associated with Albert Einstein. During an expedition to verify general relativity during a solar eclipse in 1914, World War I broke out and he was interned in Russia, for a few days, before being freed in an exchanging of prisoners. The expedition failed. After the war, he was engaged in the construction of a solar observatory in Potsdam, the Einsteinturm, and he was director of the Einstein-Institut. In 1933 Hitler came to power and Freundlich was forced to leave Germany; he had a Jewish grandmother and his wife was Jewish. He was appointed professor at the University of Istanbul, which was reformed by Kemal Atat√ºrk with the help of many German scholars. In 1937 he left Istanbul to take up the post of professor of astronomy at the Charles University of Prague, but this appointment was terminated by the German occupation. On the recommendation of Arthur Stanley Eddington he went to St. Andrews University in Scotland, where he lectured in astronomy from 1939. In 1941 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were William Greaves, Alexander Aitken, Max Born and Robert Schlapp. In 1951 he was created John Napier Professor of Astronomy. On his retirement in 1959, he returned to his native town Wiesbaden and was appointed professor at the University of Mainz. Freundlich died in Wiesbaden, Germany on 24 July 1964. Achievements Freundlich researched the deflection of light rays passing close to the Sun. He proposed an experiment, during an eclipse, to verify the validity of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Freundlich's demonstration would have proven Newton's theories incorrect. He did conduct inconclusive tests on the prediction by Einstein's theory of gravitation- induced red shift of spectral lines in the Sun, using the solar observatories he had constructed in Potsdam and Istanbul. In 1953, he proposed with Max Born an alternative explanation of the red shifts observed in galaxies by a tired light model. Publications * Die Grundlagen der Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie.

They are often then pan-fried before serving. Pierogi are most often associated with the cuisine of Poland, though other similar dumplings are considered traditional dishes in several Central and Eastern European nations.Among them: Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine. The dish was classified as \\"–º–∞–ª–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π\\" (malorossiyskiy, Little Russian), with \\"–ú–∞–ª–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏—è\\" (Malorossiya, Little Russia) being at that time a common geographical term referring to the territory of modern-day Ukraine. () () Pierogi are also popular in modern-day American cuisine, where they are sometimes known under different local names. Typical fillings include potato, farmer cheese, sauerkraut, ground meat, mushrooms, or fruits. Savory pierogi are often served with a topping of sour cream, fried onions, or both.  Etymology  Traditional Christmas Eve pierogi, whose name is derived from a root meaning 'festival' The English word \\"pierogi\\" comes from Polish ' , which is the plural form of ' , a generic term for filled dumplings. It derives from Old East Slavic (') and further from Proto-Slavic *pir—ä, \\"feast\\".Food Culture in Russia and Central Asia, 2005, p 75, By Glenn Randall Mack, Asele Surina While dumplings as such are found throughout Eurasia, the specific name pierogi, with its Proto-Slavic root and its cognates in the West and East Slavic languages, including Russian (', \\"pie\\") and (', \\"baked pastries\\"), shows the name's common Slavic origins, antedating the modern nation states and their standardized languages. In most of these languages the word means \\"pie\\". Among Ukrainians and Ukrainian Canadians, they are known as varenyky. The word is the plural form of ('), which derives from Ukrainian (') \\"boiling liquid\\", indicating boiling as the primary cooking method for this kind of dumpling. The same term is used in the Mennonite community, sometimes spelled varenikie or wareniki. Bryndzov√© pirohy is the Slovak term for dumplings filled with sheep milk cheese. Col»õuna»ôi is the Romanian term for filled dumplings. It is derived from Greek , kalts√∫ni, itself a borrowing from Italian calzoni.  Origin legends  While the origin of the pierogi is often under debate, the exact origin of the dish is unknown and unverifiable. It likely originated somewhere in Central Europe or Eastern Europe, and has been consumed in these regions long before any of the present political nations existed. Today, it is a large part of many Central European and Eastern European cultures. One legend relates that in 1238, Hyacinth of Poland visited Ko≈õcielec, and on his visit, a storm destroyed all crops; Hyacinth told everyone to pray and by the next day, crops rose back up. As a sign of gratitude, people made pierogi from those crops for Saint Hyacinth. Another legend states that Saint Hyacinth fed the people with pierogi during a famine caused by an invasion by the Tatars in 1241. One source theorizes that in the 13th century, pierogi were brought to Polish territories by Hyacinth of Poland from the Far East (Asia) via eastern neighbors such as Kievan Rus'. None of these legends is supported by the etymological origin of the root pir≈≠-.  Ingredients and preparation =Fillings Pierogi may be stuffed (singularly or in combinations) with mashed potatoes, fried onions, quark or farmer cheese, cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, mushrooms, spinach, cheese, or other ingredients depending on the cook's preferences. Dessert versions of the dumpling can be stuffed with sweetened quark or with a fresh fruit filling such as cherry, strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, apple or plum; stoned prunes are sometimes used, as well as jam. For more flavor, sour cream can be added to the dough mixture, and this tends to lighten the dough. Preparation The dough, which is made by mixing flour and warm water, sometimes with an egg, is rolled flat and then cut into squares with a knife or circles using a cup or drinking glass. The dough can be made with some mashed potato, creating a smoother texture. Another variation popular among Czechs and Slovaks, uses dough made of flour and curd with eggs, salt, and water. The filling is placed in the middle and the dough folded over to form a half circle or rectangle or triangle if the dough is cut squarely. The seams are pressed together to seal the pierogi so that the filling will remain inside when it is cooked. The pierogi are simmered until they float, drained, and then sometimes fried or baked in butter before serving or fried as leftovers. They can be served with melted butter or sour cream, or garnished with small pieces of fried bacon, onions, and mushrooms.Bacon, cheese, onion and mushroom topping for fried pierogi from urbancookingguide.com Dessert varieties may be topped with apple sauce, jam, or varenye.

Some cookbooks from the 17th century describe how during that era, the pierogi were considered a staple of the Polish diet, and each holiday had its own special kind of pierogi created. Different shapes and fillings were made for holidays such as Christmas and Easter. Important events like weddings had their own special type of pierogi kurniki ‚Äì filled with chicken. Also, pierogi were made especially for mournings or wakes, and some for caroling season in January. Pierogi festival in Krak√≥w, Poland, that occurs on the Day of St. Hyacinth Pierogi are an important part of Polish culture and cuisine today. They are served in a variety of forms and tastes (ranging from sweet to salty to spicy) and are considered to be the national dish.Mark Salter, Gordon McLachlan, Jonathan Buckley. Poland: the rough guide, 1991 and Joey Porcelli, Clay Fong. The Gyros Journey: Affordable Ethnic Eateries Along the Front Range, 2006] They are served at many festivals, playing an important role as a cultural dish. At the 2007 Pierogi Festival in Krak√≥w, 30,000 pierogi were consumed daily. Polish pierogi are often filled with fresh quark, boiled and minced potatoes, and fried onions. This type is called in Polish pierogi ruskie, which literally means \\"Ruthenian pierogi\\" (sometimes being mistranslated as ‚ÄúRussian pierogi‚Äù). Ruskie pierogi are probably the most popular kind of pierogi in North America and Poland.. The other popular pierogi in Poland are filled with ground meat, mushrooms and cabbage, or for dessert an assortment of fruits (berries, with strawberries or blueberries the most common). Sweet pierogi are usually served with sour cream mixed with sugar, and savoury pierogi with bacon fat and bacon bits. Poles traditionally serve two types of pierogi for Christmas Eve supper. One kind is filled with sauerkraut and dried mushrooms, anothersmall uszka filled only with dried wild mushroomsis served in clear barszcz. Leniwe pierogi (\\"lazy pierogi\\") are a different type of food, similar to lazy vareniki (see below), kopytka, or halu≈°ky. Ukraine Varenyky in Ukraine are a popular national dish, served both as a common everyday meal and as a part of some traditional celebrations, such as Christmas Eve Supper, Ukrainian: –°–≤—è—Ç–∞ –≤–µ—á–µ—Ä—è (Sviata Vecheria, literally Holy Supper). [citation needed] In some regions in or bordering modern-day Western Ukraine, particularly in Carpathian Ruthenia and Galicia, the terms varenyky and pyrohy are used to denote the same dish. The name pyrohy is also common among Canadian Ukrainians. This can be attributed to the history of Ukrainian and Rusyn immigration to Canada, which came not from the Russian Empire, but predominantly from the former Austria-Hungary, where the local dialects had many common words with Polish, German, Romanian, and other Central European languages. Traditional Ukrainian , before cooking and with crimped edges In other regions of Ukraine, the names pyrohy and pyrizhky refer to baked pies and buns as opposed to the boiled dumplings. The name of a popular type of Polish pierogi, pierogi ruskie (\\"Ruthenian pierogi\\"), is related to Rus', the historical region and naming of Eastern Slavs and the ancient kingdom from which Ukrainians descend. Varenyky are considered by Ukrainians as one of their national dishes and plays a fundamental role in Ukrainian culture. Contrary to many other countries that share these dumplings, Ukrainians tended to use fermented milk products (Ukrainian: kysle moloko or Ryazhenka) to bind the dough together; however, today eggs tend to be used instead. Typical Ukrainian fillings for varenyky include cottage cheese, potato, boiled beans, mushy peas, sauerkraut, plum (and other fruits), potato and cheese, cabbage, meat, fish, and buckwheat. In Ukraine varenyky are traditionally eaten with sour cream (Ukrainian: —Å–º–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ (smetana)) and butter, as well as with fried onions and fried pieces of bacon and pork fat (Ukrainian: shkvarky). Whilst traditionally savoury, varenyky can also be served as a dessert by simply substituting the filling of the dumpling to a sweeter one. Dessert varenyky fillings include sour cherry, blueberries, sweet cottage cheese, billberies and other fruits. The central regions of Ukraine are known for their more unusual varenyky, Poltava being known for its flour varenyky filling, in which the dumplings are filled with a mixture of flour, lard and fried pieces of bacon. Ukrainian filled with sour cherries as a dessertVarenyky are so beloved in Ukraine that a yearly festival commemorating them is held at the Ukrainian ski resort town of Bukovel in the Carpathian Mountains. In 2013 a snow monument to varenyky was made in Bukovel, and was submitted to the Guinness Book of Records as the biggest snow varenyk in the world. In Ukraine varenyky are not just a national dish, but also played a symbolic and ritualistic role. Ukrainian ancestors equated varenyky with a young moon since they have a similar shape, and used the dumplings as part of pagan and sacrificial rituals. For example, cheese varenyky would be sacrificed near water springs, and years ago Ukrainian peasants also believed that varenyky helped bring a rich harvest, so they took homemade dumplings with them to the fields. Slovakia A traditional dish in Slovak cuisine is , dumplings filled with salty cheese mixed with mashed potatoes. are served with some more (mixed with milk or sour cream, so it has a liquid consistency and serves as a dip) and topped with bacon or fried onion. In Slovakia, are semicircular in shape. Along with , is one of Slovakia's national dishes. Slovenia Ajdovi krapi (literally buckwheat carps) are a dish popular in the northeastern and Alpine regions of Slovenia. Made with buckwheat rather than wheat flour and filled with a mixture of cottage cheese (skuta), millet, and fried onions, they are traditionally topped with pork fat crisps, fried bacon or fried onion, but today often with butter breadcrumbs.A sample recipe (in Slovenian) at the Delo newspaper site Along with ≈æganci and ≈°truklji, they form a trio of buckwheat- based dishes typical of Slovenian cuisine. Russia Pierogi are not to be confused with the Russian baked good pirozhki. Vareniki are widespread in the western and in the Asian regions of Russia. Mostly they are filled in Russia with cherries, quark, fruits, wild berries, blueberries, potatoes, cabbage or beef. Hungary In Hungarian cuisine, the derelye is similar to pierogi, consisting of pasta pockets filled with jam, cottage cheese, or sometimes meat.Derelye recipe from chew.hu Derelye is consumed primarily as a festive food for special occasions such as weddings; it is also eaten for regular meals, but this tradition has become rare. Romania and Moldova In Romania and Moldova, a similar recipe is called col»õuna»ôi, with regional varieties such as piro»ôti in Transylvania and Bukovina regions and chiro»ôte in Moldavia region.http://www.libbyzay.com/daytoday/2011/05/recipes-sunday-dinner- moldovan/Recipes from Abroad: Sunday Dinner in Moldova Col»õuna»ôi is often a dessert filled with jam (usually plum), fresh sour cherries or cottage cheese, or savoury, filled with dill seasoned cheese (telemea or urdƒÉ), mashed potatoes or chopped meat. The dough is made with wheat flour and the col»õuna»ôi are boiled in salted water, pan-fried in oil or baked in the oven. The word is a cognate with Slavic kalduny, a type of dumplings. In both Bukovina and Transylvania, the name piro»ôti is used in Romanian families of German or Slavic origin and the filling can also be a whole, fresh, seedless plum. The term col»õuna»ô is used by native Romanian families and are usually filled with cottage cheese or quark and served topped with sour cream sm√¢nt√¢nƒÉ, traditionally called col»õuna»ôi cu sm√¢nt√¢nƒÉ. German-speaking countries and regions Schlutzkrapfen with spinach and ricotta, South Tyrol The common term Pirogge (pl. Piroggen) describes all kinds of Eastern European filled dumplings and buns, including pierogi, pirozhki and pirogs. Certain types of piroggen, both boiled and baked, were common fare for Germans living in Eastern Europe and are still prepared by their descendants living there and in Germany. In particular, baked pƒ´rƒÅdzi≈Üi are known as Kurl√§nder Speckkuchen (\\"Courland bacon/speck pies\\") in the cuisine of Baltic Germans. Schlutzkrapfen closely resemble pierogi; they are common in Tirol and northern Italy's German-speaking region of South Tyrol, and are occasionally found in Bavaria. Fillings may include meat or potatoes, but the most widespread filling is a combination of spinach and quark (Topfen) or ricotta. Another similar Austrian dish, known as K√§rntner Nudel (Carinthian noodles), is made with a wide range of fillings, from meat, mushrooms, potato or quark to apples, pears or mint. These regional specialties differ significantly from the most common Swabian filled dumplings known as Maultaschen. The US and Canada Pierogi special at a fast-food stall in St. Lawrence Market, Toronto Pierogi were brought to the United States and Canada by Central and Eastern European immigrants. They are particularly common in areas with large Polish or Ukrainian populations, such as Pittsburgh, Chicago, and New York City along with its New Jersey suburbs. Pierogi were at first a family food among immigrants as well as being served in ethnic restaurants. In the post‚ÄìWorld War II era, freshly cooked pierogi became a staple of fundraisers by ethnic churches. By the 1960s, pierogi were a common supermarket item in the frozen food aisles in many parts of the United States and Canada. Pierogi have maintained their place in grocery stores to this day. While pierogi are often eaten as a main dish in Canada and European countries, Americans often consider them a side dish, frequently served with meat. Numerous towns with Central and Eastern European heritage celebrate the pierogi. The city of Whiting, Indiana, celebrates the food at its Pierogi Fest every July. Pierogis are also commonly associated with Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania especially, where there is a \\"pierogi race\\" at every home Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game. In the race, six runners wearing pierogi costumes race toward a finish line. In 1993, the village of Glendon in Alberta, Canada, erected a roadside tribute to this culinary creation: a 25-foot (7.6 m) fibreglass perogy (preferred local spelling), complete with fork.\\"World's Largest Pierogi\\" in Glendon, Alberta, from bigthings.ca The United States has a substantial pierogi market because of its large Central and Eastern European immigrant populations. Unlike other countries with newer populations of European settlers, the modern pierogi is found in a wide selection of flavors throughout grocery stores in the United States. Many of these grocery-brand pierogi contain non-traditional ingredients to appeal to American tastes, including spinach, jalape√±o and chicken. Pierogi enjoyed a brief popularity as a sports food when Paula Newby-Fraser adopted them as her food of choice for the biking portion of the 1989 Hawaii Ironman Triathlon. For more than a decade thereafter, Mrs. T's (the largest American pierogi manufacturer) sponsored triathlons,Mrs. T's Triathlon , Chicago (2000), from active.com some professional triathletes and \\"fun runs\\" around the country. For many triathletes, pierogi represented an alternative to pasta as a way to boost their carbohydrate intakes. According to pierogi manufacturer Mrs. T's, based in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, pierogi consumption in the United States is largely concentrated in a geographical region dubbed the \\"Pierogi Pocket\\", an area including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Chicago, Detroit, parts of the northern Midwest and southern New England which accounts for 68 percent of annual US pierogi consumption. Canada has a large Polish population, as well as Ukrainian and Rusyn populations, and pierogi are common throughout the country. The Canadian market for pierogi is second only to that of the U.S. market, the latter having been the destination of choice for the majority of Central and Eastern European immigrants before and during World War II. Packed frozen pierogi can be found wherever Central and Eastern European immigrant communities exist and are generally ubiquitous across Canada, even in big chain stores. Typically frozen flavours include analogs of ruskie pierogi filled with potato and either Cheddar cheese, onion, bacon, cottage cheese or mixed cheeses. Home-made versions are typically filled with either mashed potatoes (seasoned with salt and pepper and often mixed with dry curd cottage cheese or cheddar cheese), sauerkraut, or fruit. These are then boiled, and either served immediately, put in ovens and kept warm, or fried in oil or butter. Popular fruit varieties include strawberry, blueberry, and saskatoon berry. Potato and cheese or sauerkraut versions are usually served with some or all the following: butter or oil, sour cream (typical), fried onions, fried bacon or kielbasa (sausage), and a creamy mushroom sauce (less common). Some ethnic kitchens will deep-fry perogies; dessert and main course dishes can be served this way. A good method is to par-boil the dumplings, then after drying, they are pan fried or deep-fried. The frozen varieties are sometimes served casserole-style with a mixture of chopped ham, onions, peppers and cheddar cheese or with an Italian-style mixture of ground beef, onions and tomato sauce.Perfect Perogy Casserole from Cheemo Recipes Page www.cheemo.com National chain restaurants feature the dish or variations. Boston Pizza has a sandwich and a pizza flavoured to taste like perogies, while Smitty's serves theirs as an appetizer deep-fried with salsa. Although called varenyky in standard Ukrainian, speakers of the Canadian Ukrainian or Rusyn dialect refer to them as pyrohy, which can be misheard pedaheh or pudaheh by Anglophones unaccustomed to the rolled-r sound, or alveolar flap. This is due to the history of Ukrainian or Rusyn (Ruthenian) immigration to Canada, which came predominantly from the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. Lazy pierogi and lazy varenyky Lazy varenyky (, ) in Ukrainian and Russian cuisine or leniwe pyrohy in Rusyn are gnocchi-shaped dumplings made by mixing tvoroh (curd cheese) with egg and flour into quick dough. The cheese-based dough is formed into a long sausage about 2 cm thick, which is cut diagonally into gnocchi, called halushky in Ukrainian and Rusyn, galushki in Russian. The dumplings are then quickly boiled in salted water and served with sour cream or melted butter. The name \\"lazy varenyky\\" faithfully reflects the very quick preparation time of the dish: It usually takes 10 to 15 minutes from assembling the simple ingredients to serving the cooked dumplings.Lazy vareniki: recipe, preparation, and serving suggestion. Lazy varenyky differ from standard varenyky in the same way that Italian gnocchi differ from ravioli or tortellini: these are fluffy solid dumplings, not stuffed pockets of dough. The same dish in Polish cuisine is called lazy pierogi ().

Pirozhki are a popular street food and comfort food in Russia and a stereotypical part of Russian culture. Terminology The stress in pirozhki is on the last syllable: . PirozhokAlso transliterated as piroshok (, singular) is the diminutive form of Russian pirog, which means a full-sized pie.The full-sized pie can also be called by the diminutive name for purely stylistic reasons. Pirozhki are not to be confused with the Polish pierogi (a cognate term), which are called varenyky in Ukrainian and Russian. Variations A typical pirozhok is boat- or rarely crescent-shaped, made of yeast-leavened dough, with filling completely enclosed. Similar Russian pastries (pirogs) of other shapes include coulibiac, kalitka, rasstegai, and vatrushka. Pirozhki are either fried or baked. They come in sweet or savory varieties. Common savory fillings include ground meat, mashed potato, mushrooms, boiled egg with scallions, or cabbage. Typical sweet fillings are fruit (apple, cherry, apricot, lemon), jam, or quark. Baked pirozhki may be glazed with egg to produce golden color. Also they may be decorated with strips of dough. Pirozhki are usually hand-sized. A smaller version may be served with soups. Regional varieties Puff pastry pirozhki The Balkans The Greek variety piroski () is popular in parts of Greece, as brought by Pontic Greeks, and in most big cities, where they are sold as a type of fast food. The Greek piroskia come deep-fried with many different stuffings.Greek piroski In Serbia the local variety are cylindrical pastries called –ø–∏—Ä–æ—à–∫–∞/piro≈°ka (piroshka). They are stuffed with fillings such as ground spiced meat mix of pork and veal or cottage cheese, and with kulen, tomato sauce and herbs. Alternatively they are made from breaded crepes with variety of fillings. The Baltic region In Latvia crescent-shaped buns of leavened dough called speƒ∑rau≈°i (literally, \\"fatback tarts\\") or speƒ∑a pƒ´rƒÅgi (often referred to in diminutive speƒ∑a pƒ´rƒÅdzi≈Üi or colloquially simply pƒ´rƒÅgi or pƒ´rƒÅdzi≈Üi) are traditionally filled with smoked fatback and onion. Other fillings are also possible.Latvian pƒ´rƒÅgi However the name pƒ´rƒÅgi is not exclusive to these buns, but can refer to variety of other pastries, such as pies and turnovers. Pƒ´rƒÅgi were often eaten as lunch by farmers and shepherds working the fields. Estonians (and Finns) too have this tradition. The pirukad or \\"saiakesed\\" are fairly small in size and have regional variations in respect to fillings. They are usually made with puff pastry. Open pies covering the scale of whole baking tray are also popular, more similar to American pies. Many recipes exist, with meat, cabbage, carrots, rice, egg and other fillings and filling mixtures also being used. Sweet fillings are as popular as savory pirukad with fillings like apple, various berries, marzipan, various spices and jam. Caucasus The Russian variant of pirozhki is a common fast food in Armenia and Azerbaijan. In Armenia it often contains a potato or seasoned meat filling. In Azerbaijan it is often eaten as a dessert, and is commonly filled with cream. Central Asia Pirozhki are common as fast food on the streets of the Central Asian countries in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, where they were introduced by the Russians. They are also made by many Russians and non- Russians at home. East Asia Pirozhki is also very common as fast food in Mongolia, and it is made throughout the country by families at home. Finland The Finnish version is the similar lihapiirakka, a popular street food made with donut dough, minced meat and rice. Iran Iranian homemade pirashki and fries The Iranian version, pirashki ( ), is often consumed as a dessert or as a street food. It is commonly filled with pastry cream, but potato and meat fillings are also available. The Iranian sweet shops in Los Angeles have invented other versions such as chocolate and blueberries. Japan A Japanese version, called „Éî„É≠„Ç∑„Ç≠ (piroshiki), are predominantly fried, use fillings such as ground meat, boiled egg, bean noodles, and spring onion, and are commonly breaded with panko before frying, in the manner of Japanese menchi-katsu. Another popular variation is filled with Japanese curry and is quite similar to karƒì-pan, which is itself said to be inspired by pirozhki. The Americas Varieties of pirozhki were brought to the Americas by Volga Germans. Known today as bierock, pirok or runza, they belong to several regional cuisines in the United States, Canada and Argentina. The populous Russian diaspora which came to the Americas as a consequence of the Russian Revolution and Civil War brought with them the more classic Russian versions of piroshki.

It was most commonly seen in workers in the matchstick industry in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was caused by white phosphorus vapour, which destroys the bones of the jaw. Modern occupational hygiene practices have since eliminated the working conditions that caused this disease. Symptoms Those with phossy jaw would usually begin suffering painful toothaches and swelling of the gums. The pain was characterized as \\"persistent yet progressive ... spreading to neighboring teeth and jawbone\\". Over time, pus formation developed penetrating the oral mucosa with the formation of fistula, teeth loss, and recurrent abscesses. Further progression led to the formation of sequestrum (dead bone that has separated from living bone) after three months and necrosis of the jaw within six months. The distinguishing feature of this disease was the eventual separation of the sequestrum which was described as porous and light in weight. The lower jaw was more commonly affected than the upper jaw. Affected bones glowed a greenish-white colour in the dark. The condition also affected the brain, provoking seizures in some chronic cases . Treatment Treatments included topical antimicrobials, conservative debridement of sequestra and surgery. Surgical removal of the afflicted jaw bones could save the patient; otherwise, death from organ failure would follow. The disease was extremely painful and disfiguring to the patient, with dying bone tissue rotting away accompanied by a foul-smelling discharge. However, removal of the jaw bone had serious effects on patients' ability to eat, leading to further health concerns including malnutrition. Diagnostic imaging The clinical features appear first, pain in the teeth and jaw, abscesses, etc. as described above. Once the clinical changes occur, and the problem is made known, a doctor or dentist could see changes in the jaw bones through radiographs or x-rays. The sequestra, the part or parts of the bone that dies and breaks off are light in terms of weight and yellow to brown in color. The phossy jaw can be clearly demarcated from similar entities by radiographs. In radiographs, the sequestra present as a typical worm-eaten appearance similar to a pumice stone. Sequestra appear osteoporotic and decalcified. Separation of the dead bone from the surrounding bone appears clearly demarcated in the radiographs. History=Discovery The first case of phossy jaw was diagnosed by physician Lorinser of Vienna in 1839. The patient was a female Viennese matchstick maker who had been exposed to the phosphorus vapors over a five- year period. He named the disease \\"Phosphorimus chronicus\\". In 1844, Lorinser reported 22 cases of phossy jaw, and established the toxic effects of white phosphorus in matchsticks. International and national legislation and public organisationsEurope= Finland, in 1872, was the first country to place an absolute ban on the manufacture, use, and sale of white phosphorus in matches, followed by Denmark in 1874 and France in 1897. In Great Britain, a ban on white phosphorus matches became effective on January 1, 1910. The international association for labor legislation, an international conference, met at Berne, Switzerland in 1906 and pledged to prohibit the manufacture, importation, and sale of white phosphorus matches. This treaty was signed by Finland, Denmark, France, Switzerland, Luxemburg, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany, in what is considered as the first international attempt to ban an industrial product. =United States= Phossy jaw was publicized by the American Association for Labor Legislation, whose secretary, John B. Andrews, began investigating the disease in 1909 and found more than 100 cases. This report was published in the Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor. The White Phosphorus Match Act of 1912, signed by President William Howard Taft on April 9, 1912, required manufacturers who used white phosphorus to register with district collectors of internal revenue and to file periodic notices and returns; levied a tax of two cents per hundred matches; and required makers of white-phosphorus matches to affix revenue stamps to the matchboxes. =Asia= Russia placed a heavy tax on white phosphorus matches in 1892 which was doubled in 1905. By 1906 the production of white phosphorus matches had been reduced to one match in every fifty. India and Japan banned the use of white phosphorus in 1919 after the United States, followed by China's ban on white phosphorus usage in match production in 1925. Match industry White phosphorus was the active ingredient of most matches from the 1840s to the 1910s. Concern over phossy jaw contributed to the London matchgirls strike of 1888, and although this strike did not end the use of white phosphorus, William Booth and The Salvation Army opened a match-making factory in 1891 which used the much safer, though more expensive, red phosphorus.Fact and fiction about Salvation Army history. salvationarmy.org.au The Salvation Army also campaigned with local retailers to get them to sell only red phosphorus matches. However, it was not until the use of white phosphorus was prohibited by the international Berne Convention in 1906, and these provisions were implemented in national laws over the next few years, that industrial use ceased.Phossy jaw. Rootsweb.com. Retrieved on 2018-04-12. Mechanism of action of white phosphorus In phossy jaw patients, the forensic evidence suggested the conversion of yellow phosphorus to potent amino bisphosphonates by natural chemical reactions in the human body. Yellow phosphorus has a simple chemistry; when combined with H2O and molecules from respiration and some amino acids such as lysine, bisphosphonates result. Links to bisphosphonates A related condition, bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BON), has been described as a side-effect of amino- bisphosphonates, a class of phosphorus-based drugs that inhibit bone resorption and are used widely for treating osteoporosis, bone disease in cancer and some other conditions. BON, sometimes called \\"bis-phossy jaw\\", is primarily associated with the use of intravenous bisphosphonates in the treatment of cancer. The percentage incidence of BON from this use is approximately 1000 times higher than the incidence of BON caused by the use of oral bisphosphonates.

He devoted much of his papacy to improving churches and fighting Monothelism. Rise Born in Rome, Adeodatus was the son of a man named Jovinianus. became a Benedictine monk of the Roman cloister of St Erasmus on the Caelian Hill. He became pope on 11 April 672 in succession to Vitalian. His election was ratified by the exarch of Ravenna within weeks, as required during the period of Byzantine papacy. At the time, he was already an old man. Pontificate Adeodatus II's pontificate is extremely obscure. It coincided with a surge of passionate interest in Pope Martin I and Maximus the Confessor, who were known for resisting the support of the Eastern Roman emperors for Monothelism. In light of this, Pope Adeodatus rejected the synodical letters sent to him by Patriarch Constantine I of Constantinople. Because of this, his name was excluded from the diptychs in Constantinople. Adeodatus was active in improving monastic discipline and in the repression of Monothelitism and gave Venice the right to choose its doge. During his pontificate the basilica of St. Pietro at the eight milestone of Via Portuense. St Erasmus was also reconstructed. Elected as Pope on 11 April 672, Adeodatus II did not get involved in political events and disengaged himself from the events at the time surrounding Monothelitism. Pope Adeodatus II devoted his reign to the restoration of churches in disrepair. He protected the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul (known as St. Augustine's Abbey), exempted Marmoutier Abbey, Tours (Abbey of St. Martin of Tours) from the authority of the Holy See, and led improvements to St. Erasmus' monastery. He is sometimes called saint and 26 June is given as his feast day, but this is disputed. Adeodatus II's papacy did not contribute by a large amount to society. He died on 17 June 676 and was succeeded by Donus.

Few details survive about him or his achievements beyond what is recorded in the Liber Pontificalis. Election Donus was the son of a Roman named Maurice. He became pope on 2 November 676, having been selected to succeed Adeodatus II. By that time, Donus was already elderly. Pontificate Donus expanded the clergy of Rome with twelve new priests and five deacons. He also consecrated six bishops for various sees.Duchesne, p. 348. One of these may have been Vitalianus of Arezzo. He had the atrium of Old St. Peter's Basilica paved with large blocks of white marble, and restored other churches of Rome, notably the church of St. Euphemia on the Appian Way and the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls.Duchesne, Liber Pontificalis I, p. 348, who conjectures in note 2 that the church in question was not the Basilica, but instead a small church commemorating the parting of Peter and Paul on their way to execution. Mann, pp. 20-21. Donus was shocked to discover a colony of Nestorian monks in Boetianum, a Syrian monastery in Rome. He gave their monastery to Roman monks and dispersed them through the various religious houses of the city in the hope that they would accept Chalcedonian Christianity. The Nestorians were possibly refugees fleeing the Muslim conquest of the Levant. During the pontificate of Donus, Archbishop Reparatus of Ravenna returned to the obedience of the Holy See, thus ending the schism created by Archbishop Maurus, who had aimed at making Ravenna autocephalous.Oestereich, Thomas. \\"Pope Donus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 12 September 2017] Donus' relations with Constantinople tended towards the conciliatory. On 10 August 678 Emperor Constantine IV addressed him as \\"the most holy and blessed archbishop of our ancient Rome and the universal pope,\\" hoping to attract him to engage in negotiations with the patriarch of Constantinople and the Monothelites.Delogu, p. 61 note 14: Dono sanctissimo ac beatissimo archiepiscopo antiquae nostrae Romae et universali papae....\\" He ordered that Pope Vitalianus' name be put back in the diptychs of those bishops in communion with Constantinople, an act which caused him a great deal of trouble from the Monothelites and Patriarch Theodore I of Constantinople.Baronius (ed.Theiner), p. 600 (year 677, no. 2). The restoration was ordered by the VI Ecumenical Council. Donus died on 11 April 678 and was buried the same day in Old St. Peter's Basilica. He was succeeded by Agatho.Duchesne, p. 348.

They discovered the Buneman‚ÄìHartree criterion for the voltage threshold of a magnetron operation. After the war, Buneman developed theories and simulations of collision-less dissipation of currents called the Buneman instability. This is an example of anomalous resistivity or absorption. It is anomalous because the phenomenon does not depend on collisions. Buneman advanced elliptic equation solver methods and their associated applications (as well as for the fast Fourier transforms).

Hate mail often contains exceptionally abusive, foul or otherwise hurtful language. The recipient may receive disparaging remarks concerning their ethnicity, sexuality, gender, religion, intelligence, political ideology, sense of ethics, or sense of aesthetics. The text of hate mail often contains profanity, or it may simply contain a negative, disappropriating message. Senders of hate mail normally send anonymous letters or pose as someone else (either a different or fictitious individual) in order to avoid being identified and tracked down, as the nature of some hate mail would inevitably result in criminal charges if the sender was identified. Notable examples of hate mail Hate mail has frequently been issued to footballers and managers by fans of rival football teams, and also by their own fans who are dissatisfied with the performance of an individual player, manager or the team. Neil Lennon, the former Celtic F.C. manager, received hate mail including a package containing nail bomb from Rangers fans. Two men were jailed for five years in April 2012 for sending a nail bomb to Lennon. The parents of 10-year-old Holly Wells, a Cambridgeshire girl who was murdered along with her friend Jessica Chapman in the highly- publicised Soham murders in August 2002, received several letters shortly after their daughter's body was found, accusing them both of being involved in the murder of the two girls. They also received several letters with content including that they \\"got what they deserved\\" for allowing their daughter to play out on the Sabbath. Other letters with sexual content referring to the possible circumstances of her death were also written. The parents of Sarah Payne, who was murdered in West Sussex in July 2000, received an anonymous letter while she was still missing, accusing her father and grandfather of having murdered her. After Sarah's body was found, her parents also received letters berating them for allowing Sarah and her three siblings to play unsupervised on a beach.Her mother, Sara Payne, now a child protection campaigner, closed her Twitter social networking account in November 2014 following a long campaign of abuse by trolls, which included allegations that she had made a vast amount of money from her media work and was \\"glorying in a lavish lifestyle\\" as a result, suggestions that Roy Whiting (convicted of Sarah's murder) was innocent, threatening messages from Twitter users claiming to be paedophiles, and remarks about the death of her former husband Michael from an alcoholism related illness the previous month.

Name Compared with the main part of the Downs to the east of it, it is a narrow elongated ridge, hence its name. Jane Austen, in a letter to her sister Cassandra dated Thursday 20 May 1813 from her brother's house in Sloane Street, wrote of her journey to London in a curricle via \\"the Hog's-back\\" :\\"Upon the whole it was an excellent journey & very thoroughly enjoyed by me; the weather was delightful the greatest part of the day. ... I never saw the country from the Hogsback so advantageously.\\" This shows that it was known as the Hog's Back by Jane Austen's time. However, the medieval name for the ridge was Guildown (recorded first in 1035 where it was the site of the abduction of Prince Alfred of Wessex by Earl Godwin and then in the Pipe Rolls for 1190 and onwards) but this name is no longer in use. However, the name Guildown is evoked by Guildown Road, a residential road which climbs the southern side of the ridge on the southwestern fringes of Guildford. The Guild- element of Guildown is the same as that found in Guildford, meaning \\"gold\\". Various explanations have been suggested for the relationship between the names of Guildown and Guildford. Guildown may be an abbreviation of Guildford Down (\\"the Down by Guildford\\"). The Hog's Back ends at Guildford, which is the point where the River Wey cuts through the North Downs. Alternatively, both Guildown and Guildford may derive independently from a gold-coloured feature; either the yellow flowers of the marsh marigold or the gold-coloured (sandy) soil of the hillside. Position The Hog's Back has a minimum prominence (drop) of , reaching above sea level, the 24th highest hill in Surrey.Database of British and Irish Hills Retrieved 2015-03-06 Along its course are half panoramas north and south separated by less than viewable from paths alongside the road which runs along the Hog's Back (the A31). The view north includes many towns and villages, including Ash and Aldershot which on a clear day reaches to London, as far as Canary Wharf, Tower 42, The Gherkin, Wembley Arch and Heathrow Airport. The view to the south is unspoilt and has been designated an area of outstanding natural beauty as well as a site of special scientific interest. These views extend to Hindhead and the Devil's Punchbowl. Road The road along the Hog's Back is ancient, since its raised position offered travellers a vantage point and also kept them above the thick ancient woodland of the valleys on either side. It was part of the ancient ridgeway which runs from Wiltshire down to the east coast of Kent. It was also part of the road from London to Winchester (as it still is). Although there is very little archaeological evidence in support, it has been suggested that a Roman road ran from London to Winchester and that, at this point, it passed, either over the Hog's Back or perhaps a little to the north (e.g. Roman Surrey, David Bird, 2004). Research on this is continuing. According to the Victoria County History of Surrey (volume 3, published 1911, p 374, s.v. Wanborough), the road over the Hog's Back was \\"the Via Regia of early deeds and Hundred Rolls\\". What is now designated the A31 along the Hog's Back originally formed part of a road leading directly from Winchester into Guildford High Street and from there into London. However, the modern A31 adopts a slightly less direct and less steep approach to the High Street, and reorganisation of central Guildford into a roundabout road system centred on the Friary Centre (named after the medieval Dominican Friary there) has also broken up this direct stretch of road at the point that it reaches Guildford. When the idea of the Pilgrims' Way to Canterbury was popularised in the nineteenth century, a route over the southern slopes of the Hog's back, parallel with the ridgeway and running through Seale and Puttenham, was incorporated in its course. In order to avoid the A31, however, the Pilgrims' Way does not run along the top of the Hog's Back. The Hog's Back stretch of the A31 is now a dual carriageway, but the two directions of the road are separated by a central area of trees, some of them very old. The original road ran along the stretch now occupied by the lanes running from Guildford to Farnham, i.e. from east to west. The other two lanes, running from west to east, which are a little below the high point occupied by the original carriageways, were added in the early 1970s. Archaeology and Seven Ditches Roughly midway along the ridge of the Hog‚Äôs Back between Farnham and Guildford (OS grid reference SU911483), the human remains of at least six skeletons were discovered in 1935 when ground was being dug for a new water pipe. They were buried less than a yard from the then-northern edge of the road (now part of the central grass verge between the two carriageways). One of them was buried prone and another showed signs of having originally been bound or trussed, and scholars now believe that they were criminals buried here after execution at different times over an extended period (Reynolds in 2005; Briggs in 2010). Their burial place was at the meeting point of the parishes of Wanborough, Seale (originally Farnham) and Puttenham, which were each in the different hundreds of Woking, Farnham and Godalming respectively. It is suggested by Rob Briggs that an elevated site at the junction of different hundreds and parishes was probably a site of general assembly and he identifies it with the place name Seven Ditches, found in the charter of King Caedwalla of Wessex confirming Farnham to the Bishop of Winchester (following the original grant by King Edward the Elder in 909 AD) (Latin '); and also in a feoffment defining the Shoelands estate in about 1210 (Latin ‚ÄúSeuedic‚Äù); and also in the plea rolls of the 1263 Surrey Eyre, noting the hanging of one Robert de la Felde of Send at (Latin) ‚ÄúSeinedik‚Äù, translated Sendike or Seven Ditches. Notable buildings On the north side of the Hog's Back near the turn off to the village of Seale formerly stood a mansion known as Poyle Hill Lodge. This was once one of the Admiralty semaphore stations because of its high vantage point. In 1935 it became the Hog's Back Hotel, initially owned by the Guildford Friary Brewery, and it remains a hotel, now officially known as the Hog's Back Hotel and Spa, Farnham. On the south side of the Hog's Back, a little to the east of Poyle Hill, another large mansion was built in 1873 called Great Down, attributed to Robert Kerr. This was demolished in about 1950, but the parkland and other associated buildings, such as a lodge and stables, remain. Also on the south side is Greyfriars House, a Grade II* listed Arts and Crafts style mansion built in 1896 by the renowned architect Charles Voysey. It is now a boutique wedding venue. The Hogs Back Brewery is an independent real ale brewery based in Tongham, which is a village just below the Hog's Back. The Hog's Back Cafe is in a layby on the Guildford to Farnham (westbound) carriageway of the A31 along the Hog's Back, between the turn offs to Puttenham and Seale. It is popular with lorry drivers, who use the cafe and toilets during the day. The hillside adjacent to the A31 layby was a popular site for dogging (viewing or participating in sexual relations in a public place), but recently (2012‚Äì13) Guildford police and local residents are curbing these practices. Towards Guildford, on the north-east side of the Hog‚Äôs Back, lie Down Place and Blackwell Farm. The manor of Down Place was demolished in 1963, all that remains today of the estate are the stables where is established Hogs Back Books, the children‚Äôs book publisher. Once associated with the manor as one of the first model farm in Surrey, Blackwell Farm is now a place of controversies since the University of Surrey, its owner, announced its plan to build a \\"Garden Neighbourhood\\" as part of Guildford Borough Council's local plan consultation.  Geology  The Hog's Back is formed of chalk of Cretaceous age, laid down in shallow seas from the deposition of the calcium carbonate skeletons of micro-organisms. The Hog's Back is the surface representation of a monoclinal fold, where once horizontal chalk beds have been folded into steeply sloping layers. Across much of the North Downs, the angle of the chalk as it disappears below the surface is relatively shallow (c. 18¬∞ near Dorking), however at the Hog's Back, local faulting has produced a much steeper angle (up to 55¬∞). To the north of the ridge lies the London Clay, and to the south the clays of the Wealden Group. The chalk is more resistant to weathering than the flanking clays, leading to the ridge's prominence over the surrounding terrain. The Hog's Back gives its name to the geomorphological landform known as a Hogback, which is a long narrow ridge or series of hills with a narrow crest and steep slopes of nearly equal inclination on both flanks.Huggett, JR (2011) Fundamentals of Geomorphology, 3rd ed., Routledge, New York. 516 pp. In popular culture The Hog's Back is mentioned in: * Richard Thompson's song MGB-GT. * The Freeman Wills Crofts detective novel The Hog's Back Mystery (1933) * Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. * The Adventure of Johnnie Waverly, an episode in season one of the TV Series, Agatha Christie's Poirot. * The Paul Temple radio detective story, Paul Temple and the Gilbert Case. * Bulldog Drummond, novel by \\"Sapper\\" References Category:Hills of Surrey Category:Ridges of England ","title":"Hog's Back"},{"id":"439597","text":"USS Tennessee (SSBN-734) is a United States Navy ballistic missile submarine that has been in commission since 1988.

While the term natural justice is often retained as a general concept, it has largely been replaced and extended by the general \\"duty to act fairly\\". The basis for the rule against bias is the need to maintain public confidence in the legal system. Bias can take the form of actual bias, imputed bias or apparent bias. Actual bias is very difficult to prove in practice while imputed bias, once shown, will result in a decision being void without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias. Cases from different jurisdictions currently apply two tests for apparent bias: the \\"reasonable suspicion of bias\\" test and the \\"real likelihood of bias\\" test. One view that has been taken is that the differences between these two tests are largely semantic and that they operate similarly. The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals should not be penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the case, a fair opportunity to answer it, and the opportunity to present their own case. The mere fact that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the right to a fair hearing is guaranteed by Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is said to complement the common law rather than replace it. Background The courtroom of the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario. In 1999, the Court ruled in Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) that the requirements of natural justice vary according to the context of the matter arising. Natural justice is a term of art that denotes specific procedural rights in the English legal system. and the systems of other nations based on it. It is similar to the American concepts of fair procedure and procedural due process, the latter having roots that to some degree parallel the origins of natural justice.See generally , cited in Shauer, \\"English Natural Justice and American Due Process\\", p. 51, n. 24. Although natural justice has an impressive ancestry. and is said to express the close relationship between the common law and moral principles,, cited in De Smith's Judicial Review, p. 321 the use of the term today is not to be confused with the \\"natural law\\" of the Canonists, the mediaeval philosophers' visions of an \\"ideal pattern of society\\" or the \\"natural rights\\" philosophy of the 18th century.. Whilst the term natural justice is often retained as a general concept, in jurisdictions such as Australia, and the United Kingdom, it has largely been replaced and extended by the more general \\"duty to act fairly\\". Natural justice is identified with the two constituents of a fair hearing, which are the rule against bias (nemo iudex in causa sua, or \\"no man a judge in his own cause\\"), and the right to a fair hearing (audi alteram partem, or \\"hear the other side\\").. The requirements of natural justice or a duty to act fairly depend on the context. In Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1999),. the Supreme Court of Canada set out a list of non-exhaustive factors that would influence the content of the duty of fairness, including the nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it, the statutory scheme under which the decision-maker operates, the importance of the decision to the person challenging it, the person's legitimate expectations, and the choice of procedure made by the decision-maker.Baker, paras. 23‚Äì28. Earlier, in Knight v Indian Head School Division No 19 (1990),. the Supreme Court held that public authorities which make decisions of a legislative and general nature do not have a duty to act fairly, while those that carry out acts of a more administrative and specific nature do. Furthermore, preliminary decisions will generally not trigger the duty to act fairly, but decisions of a more final nature may have such an effect. In addition, whether a duty to act fairly applies depends on the relationship between the public authority and the individual. No duty exists where the relationship is one of master and servant, or where the individual holds office at the pleasure of the authority. On the other hand, a duty to act fairly exists where the individual cannot be removed from office except for cause. Finally, a right to procedural fairness only exists when an authority's decision is significant and has an important impact on the individual. Rule against bias=In general A person is barred from deciding any case in which he or she may be, or may fairly be suspected to be, biased. This principle embodies the basic concept of impartiality,. and applies to courts of law, tribunals, arbitrators and all those having the duty to act judicially.. A public authority has a duty to act judicially whenever it makes decisions that affect people's rights or interests, and not only when it applies some judicial-type procedure in arriving at decisions.See the \\"Right to a fair hearing\\" section below. The basis on which impartiality operates is the need to maintain public confidence in the legal system. The erosion of public confidence undermines the nobility of the legal system and leads to ensuing chaos.. The essence of the need for impartiality was observed by Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, in Metropolitan Properties Co (FGC) Ltd v Lannon (1968):. \\"Justice must be rooted in confidence and confidence is destroyed when right-minded people go away thinking: 'The judge was biased.'\\" Public confidence as the basis for the rule against bias is also embodied in the often-quoted words of Lord Hewart, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, that \\"[i]t is not merely of some importance, but of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly be seen to be done\\". R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy [1924] 1 KB 256 at 259, High Court (King's Bench) (England & Wales). Forms of biasActual and imputed bias= A portrait of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham (Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham, 1781‚Äì1851), by Charles Robert Leslie. In Dimes v Grand Junction Canal (1852), his Lordship was disqualified from hearing a case as he had a pecuniary interest in the outcome. Bias may be actual, imputed or apparent. Actual bias is established where it is actually established that a decision-maker was prejudiced in favour of or against a party. However, in practice, the making of such an allegation is rare as it is very hard to prove.. One form of imputed bias is based on the decision-maker being a party to a suit, or having a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the outcome of the decision. Once this fact has been established, the bias is irrebuttable and disqualification is automatic‚Äîthe decision-maker will be barred from adjudicating the matter without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias.. A classic case is Dimes v Grand Junction Canal (1852), which involved an action between Dimes, a local landowner, and the proprietors of the Grand Junction Canal, in which the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, had affirmed decrees made to the proprietors. However, it was discovered by Dimes that Lord Cottenham, in fact, owned several pounds' worth of shares in the Grand Junction Canal. This eventually led to the judge being disqualified from deciding the case. There was no inquiry as to whether a reasonable person would consider Lord Cottenham to be biased, or as to the circumstances which led Lord Cottenham to hear the case. In certain limited situations, bias can also be imputed when the decision-maker's interest in the decision is not pecuniary but personal. This was established in the unprecedented case of R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No.2) (1999).. In an appeal to the House of Lords, the Crown Prosecution Service sought to overturn a quashing order made by the Divisional Court regarding extradition warrants made against the ex-Chilean dictator, Senator Augusto Pinochet. Amnesty International (AI) was given leave to intervene in the proceedings. However, one of the judges of the case, Lord Hoffmann, was a director and chairperson of Amnesty International Charity Ltd. (AICL), a company under the control of AI. He was eventually disqualified from the case and the outcome of the proceedings set aside. The House of Lords held that the close connection between AICL and AI presented Lord Hoffmann with an interest in the outcome of the litigation. Even though it was non-pecuniary, the Law Lords took the view that the interest was sufficient to warrant Lord Hoffmann's automatic disqualification from hearing the case. In Locabail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd (1999),. the Court of Appeal warned against any further extension of the automatic disqualification rule, \\"unless plainly required to give effect to the important underlying principles upon which the rule is based\\". =Apparent bias= Apparent bias is present where a judge or other decision-maker is not a party to a matter and does not have an interest in its outcome, but through his or her conduct or behaviour gives rise to a suspicion that he or she is not impartial.Ex parte Pinochet, pp. 132‚Äì133. An issue that has arisen is the degree of suspicion which would provide the grounds on which a decision should be set aside for apparent bias. Currently, cases from various jurisdictions apply two different tests: \\"real likelihood of bias\\" and \\"reasonable suspicion of bias\\". The real likelihood test centres on whether the facts, as assessed by the court, give rise to a real likelihood of bias.R v Rand (1866) LR 1 QB 230 at 233, High Court (Queen's Bench) (England & Wales). In R v Gough (1993),. the House of Lords chose to state the test in terms of a \\"real danger of bias\\", and emphasized that the test was concerned with the possibility, not probability, of bias. Lord Goff of Chievely also stated that \\"the court should look at the matter through the eyes of a reasonable man, because the court in cases such as these personifies the reasonable man\\". However, the test in Gough has been disapproved of in some Commonwealth jurisdictions. One criticism is that the emphasis on the court's view of the facts gives insufficient emphasis to the perception of the public.. These criticisms were addressed by the House of Lords in Porter v Magill (2001).. The Court adjusted the Gough test by stating it to be \\"whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased\\". This case therefore established the current test in the UK to be one of a \\"real possibility of bias\\". On the other hand, the reasonable suspicion test asks whether a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant is not possible.R v Liverpool City Justices, ex parte Topping [1983] 1 W.L.R. 119 at 123, High Court (Queen's Bench) (England & Wales). Although not currently adopted in the UK, this test has been endorsed by the Singapore courts.Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew [1992] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 791 at 825‚Äì826, paras. 80‚Äì83, C.A.; Tang Liang Hong v. Lee Kuan Yew [1997] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 576 at 595‚Äì596, para. 46, C.A. It has been suggested that the differences between the two tests are largely semantic and that the two tests operate similarly. In Locabail, the judges stated that in a large proportion of the cases, application of the two tests would lead to the same outcome. It was also held that \\"[p]rovided that the court, personifying the reasonable man, takes an approach which is based on broad common sense, and without inappropriate reliance on special knowledge, the minutiae of court procedure or other matters outside the ken of the ordinary, reasonably well-informed members of the public, there should be no risk that the courts will not ensure both that justice is done and that it is perceived by the public to be done\\". In the Singapore High Court decision Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2005), Judicial Commissioner Andrew Phang observed that the real likelihood test is in reality similar to that of reasonable suspicion. First, likelihood is in fact \\"possibility\\", as opposed to the higher standard of proof centring on \\"probability\\". Secondly, he suggested that real in real likelihood cannot be taken to mean \\"actual\\", as this test relates to apparent and not actual bias. He also observed that both the court's and the public's perspectives are \\"integral parts of a holistic process\\" with no need to draw a sharp distinction between them. In contrast, in Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006),. Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon thought that there was a real difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, suspicion suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. Reasonable suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, likelihood points towards something being likely, and real suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue is the degree to which a particular event is not likely or possible Menon J.C. also disagreed with both Lord Goff in Gough and Phang J.C. in Tang Kin Hwa in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was \\"a very significant point of departure\\". The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities, this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice. As of September 2011, the Court of Appeal of Singapore had not yet expressed a view as to whether the position taken in Tang Kin Hwa or Shankar Alan is preferable. Exceptions to the rule against biasNecessity= There are cases in which a disqualified adjudicator cannot be replaced, as no one else is authorized to act. It has been observed that \\"disqualification of an adjudicator will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power to act\\".. In such cases, natural justice has to give way to necessity in order to maintain the integrity of judicial and administrative systems.. This issue regarding necessity was raised in Dimes. The Lord Chancellor had to sign an order for enrolment in order to allow the appeal to proceed from the Vice-Chancellor to the House of Lords. It was held that his shareholding in the canal company which barred him from sitting in the appeal did not affect his power to enroll, as no one but him had the authority to do so. It was mentioned this was allowed \\"for this [was] a case of necessity, and where that occurs the objection of interest cannot prevail\\". =Waiver= The court normally requests that an objection be taken as soon as the prejudiced party has knowledge of the bias.Wakefield Local Board of Health v West Riding and Grimsby Rly. Co. (1865) L.R. 1 QB 84, High Court (Queen's Bench) (England & Wales). If an objection is not raised and proceedings are allowed to continue without disapproval, it will be held that the party has waived its right to do so.R v Byles, ex parte Hollidge (1912) 77 J.P. 40. Effect of a finding of bias In Dimes, the judges advised the House of Lords that Lord Cottenham's pecuniary interest made his judgment not void, but voidable. This advice is not wrong in the context of a judicial act under review, where the judgment will be held valid unless reversed on appeal.. However, in the cases of administrative acts or decisions under judicial review, the court can only intervene on the grounds of ultra vires, hence making the judgment void. Lord Esher said in Allison v General Council of Medical Education and Registration (1894)Allison v General Council of Medical Education and Registration [1894] 1 QB 750, Court of Appeal (England & Wales). that the participation of a disqualified person \\"certainly rendered the decision wholly void\\". Right to a fair hearing=In general A hearing of the International Court of Justice in 2006 presided over by its president, Her Excellency Dame Rosalyn Higgins. A fundamental aspect of natural justice is that before a decision is made, all parties should be heard on the matter. It has been suggested that the rule requiring a fair hearing is broad enough to include the rule against bias since a fair hearing must be an unbiased hearing. However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard. The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a fair opportunity to answer them, and the opportunity to present their own cases.. Besides promoting an individual's liberties, the right to a fair hearing has also been used by courts as a base on which to build up fair administrative procedures. It is now well established that it is not the character of the public authority that matters but the character of the power exercised. However, in the United Kingdom prior to Ridge v Baldwin (1963),. the scope of the right to a fair hearing was severely restricted by case law following Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works (1863).. This was seen in cases such as Local Government Board v Arlidge [1915] AC 120, House of Lords (UK); and R v Leman Street Police Station Inspector, ex parte Venicoff [1920] 3 KB 72, High Court (Kings Bench) (England & Wales). In R v Electricity Commissioners, ex parte London Electricity Joint Committee Co. (1920), Ltd. (1923),R v Electricity Commissioners, ex parte London Electricity Joint Committee Co. (1920), Ltd. [1924] 1 KB 171, High Court (Kings Bench) (England & Wales). Lord Atkin observed that the right only applied where decision-makers had \\"the duty to act judicially\\". In natural justice cases this dictum was generally understood to mean that a duty to act judicially was not to be inferred merely from the impact of a decision on the rights of subjects; such a duty would arise only if there was a \\"superadded\\" express obligation to follow a judicial-type procedure in arriving at the decision. In Ridge v Baldwin, Lord Reid reviewed the authorities extensively and attacked the problem at its root by demonstrating how the term judicial had been misinterpreted as requiring some additional characteristic over and above the characteristic that the power affected some person's rights. In his view, the mere fact that the power affects rights or interests is what makes it \\"judicial\\" and so subject to the procedures required by natural justice.See also . This removal of the earlier misconception as to the meaning of judicial is thought to have given the judiciary the flexibility it needed to intervene in cases of judicial review. (1977) 5(3) University of Tasmania Law Review 268 at 269. The mere fact that a decision-maker is conferred wide discretion by law is not reason enough for a weakening of the requirements of natural justice. In the United Kingdom context, this is demonstrated by Ahmed v H.M. Treasury (No. 1) (2010).. The Treasury had exercised powers to freeze the appellants' financial assets and economic resources on the ground that it reasonably suspected the appellants were or might be persons who had committed, attempted to commit, participated in or facilitated the commission of terrorism, pursuant to the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006 No. 2657). and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006 No. 2952). made under the United Nations Act 1946.United Nations Act 1946 (1946 c. 45), s. 12. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that since the Al-Qaida Order made no provision for basic procedural fairness, it effectively deprived people designated under the order the fundamental right of access to a judicial remedy and hence was ultra vires the power conferred by the United Nations Act 1946 for the making of the Order.See, for instance, Ahmed, p. 685, para 246, per Lord Mance J.S.C. Article 6 of the European Convention The right to a fair hearing is also referred to in Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which states:Art. 6(3) sets out some of the requirements of the right to a fair hearing, but only in the context of criminal proceedings. Article 6 does not, however, replace the common law duty to ensure a fair hearing. It has been suggested that Article 6 alone is not enough to protect procedural due process, and only with the development of a more sophisticated common law will the protection of procedural due process extend further into the administrative machine. Nonetheless, Article 6 supplements the common law. For example, the common law does not impose a general duty to give reasons for a decision, but under Article 6(1) a decision-maker must give a reasoned judgment so as to enable an affected individual to decide whether to appeal.. Aspects of a fair hearingPrior notice of hearing= Natural justice allows a person to claim the right to adequate notification of the date, time, place of the hearing as well as detailed notification of the case to be met. This information allows the person adequate time to effectively prepare his or her own case and to answer the case against him or her. In Cooper v Wandsworth, Chief Justice William Erle went so far as to state that the lack of notice and hearing afforded to Cooper could be said to be a form of abuse, as he had been treated as if he did not matter.. As Lord Mustill famously held in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p Doody (1993): \\"Since the person affected usually cannot make worthwhile representations without knowing what factors may weigh against his interests fairness will very often require that he is informed of the gist of the case which he has to answer.\\". It has been suggested that the requirement of prior notice serves three important purposes: *The interest in good outcomes ‚Äì giving prior notice increases the value of the proceedings as it is only when the interested person knows the issues and the relevant information that he or she can make a useful contribution. *The duty of respect ‚Äì the affected person has the right to know what is at stake, and it is not enough to simply inform him or her that there will be a hearing. *The rule of law ‚Äì notice of issues and disclosure of information opens up the operations of the public authority to public scrutiny. The British courts have held it is not enough for an affected person to merely be informed of a hearing. He or she must also be told what is at stake; in other words, the gist of the case. =Opportunity to be heard= Every person has the right to have a hearing and be allowed to present his or her own case. Should a person not attend the hearing, even with adequate notice given, the adjudicator has the discretion to decide if the hearing should proceed. In Ridge v Baldwin, a chief constable succeeded in having his dismissal from service declared void as he had not been given the opportunity to make a defence. In another case, Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v Evans (1982),. a chief constable required a police probationer to resign on account of allegations about his private life which he was given no fair opportunity to rebut. The House of Lords found the dismissal to be unlawful. Likewise in Surinder Singh Kanda v Federation of Malaya (1962), a public servant facing disciplinary proceedings was not supplied with a copy of a prejudicial report by a board of inquiry which the adjudicating officer had access to before the hearing. The Privy Council held that the proceedings had failed to provide him a reasonable opportunity of being heard. However, this requirement does not necessarily mean the decision-maker has to meet the complainant face to face‚Äî\\"Natural justice does not generally demand orality\\".. It has been suggested that an oral hearing will almost be as good as useless if the affected person has no prior knowledge of the case. In Lloyd v McMahon (1987),Lloyd v McMahon [1987] 1 AC 625, House of Lords (UK). an oral hearing did not make a difference to the facts on which the case was based. Giving judgment in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, Lord Justice Harry Woolf held that an oral hearing may not always be the \\"very pith of the administration of natural justice\\". It has also been suggested that an oral hearing is only required if issues concerning deprivations of legal rights or legally protected interests arise. =Conduct of the hearing= When deciding how the hearing should be conducted, the adjudicator has to ask whether the person charged has a proper opportunity to consider, challenge or contradict any evidence, and whether the person is also fully aware of the nature of the allegations against him or her so as to have a proper opportunity to present his or her own case.Kay Swee Pin v. Singapore Island Country Club [2008] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 802 at 806, para. 7. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF (2009),. Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers said: However, when a hearing requires the balancing of multiple polycentric issues such as natural justice and the protection of confidential information for national security reasons, both the concerns of public security and the right to a fair trial must be adequately met. It was held by the House of Lords in AF, applying the decision of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights A v United Kingdom (2009), that a person accused of terrorism against whom a control order has been issued must be given sufficient information about the allegations against him to enable him to give effective instructions to his special advocate. If this requirement is satisfied, a fair hearing can be conducted without detailed disclosure of confidential information that might compromise national security. On the facts of the case, a special advocate was not permitted further contact with an applicant or his ordinary legal representatives except with permission of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) after viewing confidential (or \\"closed\\") materials. The House of Lords recognized that although a special advocate's usefulness is stymied somewhat from having no further instructions after viewing such materials, if the SIAC decides to issue a control order predominantly on the basis of non-confidential (or \\"open\\") materials, an applicant cannot be regarded as having been denied an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of the government's beliefs and suspicions about him. If the evidence against the applicant is largely closed but allegations contained in open material are sufficiently specific, an applicant should be able to provide his legal representatives and special advocate with information to refute it (such as an alibi, if the open material alleges he was at a certain place during a certain period) without having to know the detail or sources of the closed evidence. However, if the evidence revealed to the person consists only of general assertions and the case against him is based solely or to a substantive extent on undisclosed adverse evidence, the fair hearing rule under natural justice will not be satisfied. In such cases, there are strong policy considerations supporting the principle that a trial procedure can never be considered fair if a person is kept in ignorance of the case against him or her. First, since the grounds for a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity can span from incontrovertible evidence to an innocent misinterpretation of facts which can be explained away by the person, in many cases it is impossible for courts to be sure that the disclosure of the evidence will make no difference to the applicant. Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non- disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself. As Lord Phillips put it, \\"if the wider public are to have confidence in the justice system, they need to be able to see that justice is done rather than being asked to take it on trust\\". The right to be heard in answer to charges before an unbiased tribunal is illustrated in the Singapore case Tan Boon Chee David v. Medical Council of Singapore (1980).Tan Boon Chee David v. Medical Council of Singapore [1979‚Äì1980] S.L.R.(R.) 523, H.C. (Singapore). During a disciplinary hearing, council members were either not conscientious about their attendance or did not attend the whole course of proceedings. This meant they did not hear all the oral evidence and submissions. The High Court held that this had substantially prejudiced the appellant and constituted a fundamental breach of natural justice. On the other hand, mere absence from a hearing does not necessarily lead to undue prejudice. It was held in Re Teo Choo Hong (1995)Re Teo Choo Hong [1995] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 441, H.C. (Singapore). that the function of a lay member of a lawyers' disciplinary committee was to observe and not cast a vote or make a judgment. Thus, the appellant had not suffered undue prejudice. On the basis of reciprocity, if one side is allowed to cross-examine his legal opponent at a hearing, the other party must also be given the same opportunity.Howe Yoon Chong v Chief Assessor [1977‚Äì1978] S.L.R.(R.) 386, H.C. (Singapore). In addition, when a tribunal decides a case on a basis not raised or contemplated by the parties, or decides it without regarding the submissions and arguments made by the parties on the issues, this will amount to a breach of natural justice.Front Row Investment Holdings (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. Daimler South East Asia Pte. Ltd. [2010] SGHC 80 at para. 31, H.C. (Singapore); see also R v Industrial Injuries Commissioner, ex parte Howarth (1968) 4 K.I.R. 621; Kay Swee Pin, p. 806, para. 7: \\"[I]f a tribunal, after the close of the hearing, comes into possession of further evidence, the party affected should be invited to comment upon it\\". However, a genuine bona fide mistake by an adjudicator in omitting to state reasons for not considering a submission is not enough to be a breach of natural justice.SEF Construction Pte. Ltd. v. Skoy Connected Pte. Ltd. [2010] 1 S.L.R. 733 at 757, para. 58. This may occur when the submissions were accidentally omitted, or were so unconvincing that it was not necessary to explicitly state the adjudicator's findings. =Right to legal representation= There is no inherent common law right to legal representation before a domestic tribunal. A tribunal has the discretion to admit either a legally qualified or unqualified counsel to assist the person appearing before it, based on the facts of the case.Kok Seng Chong v. Bukit Turf Club [1992] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 772, H.C. (Singapore). When assessing whether a party should be offered legal assistance, the adjudicator should first ask whether the right to be heard applies, and, secondly, whether counsel's assistance is needed for an effective hearing given the subject matter, bearing in mind the consequences of such a denial. In R v Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Tarrant (1983),R v Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Tarrant [1985] 1 QB 251, Divisional Court (England & Wales). Webster J. set out six factors to be considered when deciding whether to allow representation by counsel, namely: *the seriousness of the charge and the potential penalty; *whether any points of law are likely to arise.; *whether the prisoner is capable of presenting his own case; *whether there are any procedural difficulties faced by prisoners in conducting their own defence; *whether there is reasonable speed in making the adjudication; and *whether there is a need for fairness between prisoners or between prisoners and prison officers. It has also been suggested that where a tribunal hearing concerns the individual's reputation or right to livelihood, there is a greater need for allowing legal representation as this vindicates the idea of equality before the law.Doresamy v. Public Services Commission [1971] 2 Malayan Law Journal 127, High Court (Malaysia). When one refuses legal representation, one cannot expect to receive a higher \\"standard\\" of natural justice. This was enunciated in Singapore in Ho Paul v. Singapore Medical Council (2008).Ho Paul v. Singapore Medical Council [2008] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 780, H.C. (Singapore). Dr. Ho, who had been charged with professional misconduct, chose to appear before the council in person and declined to cross-examine the council's key witness. Subsequently, he argued that he should have been warned of the legal implications of not being legally represented. The High Court rejected this argument and held he had suffered no prejudice. Dr. Ho had been given a fair opportunity of presenting his own case and, most importantly, had not been deprived of his right to cross-examine the witnesses. It is also not a court's obligation to provide assistance when a party presents his or her case without legal representation. In Rajeevan Edakalavan v. Public Prosecutor (1998),Rajeevan Edakalavan v. Public Prosecutor [1998] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 10, H.C. (Singapore). the accused had appeared in person before a magistrate and had entered a plea of guilt. He later petitioned the High Court for criminal revision, arguing that as the magistrate had not informed him of the defences available to him, his plea had been equivocal. The Court held: In Singapore, the right to legal representation is contingent on the nature of the inquiry. However, since Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore guarantees equal protection under the law, it has been suggested that greater weightage should be accorded to this procedural right when balancing it against the competing demand of efficiency. =The decision and reasons for it= Currently, the principles of natural justice in the United Kingdom and certain other jurisdictions do not include a general rule that reasons should be given for decisions.Re Siah Mooi Guat [1988] 2. S.L.R.(R.) 165 at 178‚Äì179, para. 34, H.C. (Singapore). In R v Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Shaw (1951),R v Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Shaw [1952] 1 KB 338, Court of Appeal (England & Wales). Denning L.J. stated: \\"I think the record must contain at least the document which initiates the proceedings; the pleadings, if any; and the adjudication; but not the evidence, nor the reasons, unless the tribunal chooses to incorporate them. If the tribunal does state its reasons, and those reasons are wrong in law, certiorari lies to quash the decision.\\" It has been stated that \\"no single factor has inhibited the development of English administrative law as seriously as the absence of any general obligation upon public authorities to give reasons for their decisions\\".. Historically, uncontrolled public decisions have led to poor outcomes and disrespect for the decision-makers. Such decisions also lacked the regularity and transparency that distinguish them from the mere say-so of public authorities. On such grounds, there are obvious benefits for the disclosure of reasons for decisions. First, procedural participation by people affected by a decision promotes the rule of law by making it more difficult for the public authority to act arbitrarily. Requiring the giving of reasons helps ensure that decisions are carefully thought through, which in turn aids in the control of administrative discretion. Secondly, accountability makes it necessary for the public authority to face up to the people affected by a decision. When a public authority acts on all the relevant considerations, this increases the probability of better decision outcomes and, as such, is beneficial to public interests. Another important benefit is that respect for decision-makers is fostered, which increases their integrity in the public's eyes.

He was the third son of King Gustaf VI Adolf and his first wife, Princess Margaret of Connaught, as well as the uncle of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece. From 1973 to 1979 he was heir presumptive to his nephew King Carl XVI Gustaf and the Swedish throne. Early life Bertil was born 28 February 1912 at Stockholm, as the fourth of five children born to Princess Margaret of Connaught and Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden. His siblings included: Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Vasterbotten, Prince Sigvard, Duke of Uppland, Princess Ingrid and Prince Carl Johan, Duke of Dalarna. The family lived in apartments at Stockholm Palace in Stockholm, at Ulriksdal Palace near the capital in Ulriksdal and at the summer residence: Sofiero Castle in Helsingborg in the southernmost province of Sweden, Scania. Royal role Prince Bertil was granted a very old dukedom, one that was bestowed in the Middle Ages on various Danish and Swedish royal relatives, such as Benedict, Duke of Halland. After his eldest brother, Prince Gustaf Adolf, died in 1947, leaving an infant son, Prince Carl Gustaf, in the line of succession, and because his elder brother Sigvard had already given up his place in the succession (owing to a constitutionally unacceptable marriage), it seemed likely that Bertil could one day become regent. After Carl Gustaf became king, Bertil remained the next in line to the throne (until the birth of Prince Carl Philip in 1979), and continued to act as the King's deputy. When the Act of Succession was changed in 1980, rights to the throne was restricted to Carl XVI Gustaf and his descendants; however, a special addendum was made for Bertil's case, so that he became third (and, after the birth of Princess Madeleine in 1982, fourth) in line to the throne. Personal life Bertil became a naval officer; and, during the Second World War, he served as Swedish naval attach√© at the embassy in London. In 1943, Bertil had met his long-term partner, Welsh commoner Lilian Craig. However, in order to preserve his place in the royal succession, Bertil and Lilian did not marry for decades. They lived together discreetly, as a fully private arrangement, from the 1940s until their marriage was announced and took place in 1976. Their common base was a home in Sainte-Maxime, in the south of France. Since his life with Craig was not official, Prince Bertil's single status meant he was suggested as a match for, among others, Princess Margaret of the United Kingdom. After the death of Gustaf VI Adolf in 1973, the new king, Carl XVI Gustaf, married a non-royal woman and approved the marriage of Bertil and Lilian, which took place at Drottningholm Palace on 7 December 1976. Bertil was fond of cars, owning a rare Aston Martin DB2 and a Chevrolet Corvette. Volvo asked him to open the Volvo Halifax Assembly plant in 1963 in Nova Scotia, Canada. A parking garage in Sainte-Maxime is named after him. Prince Bertil was a keen supporter and practitioner of various sports, notably tennis and boules. In 1947, he was elected Chairman of both the Swedish Sports Confederation and Sweden's Olympic Committee. He was also a member of the fine-dining society La Chaine des Rotisseurs. He died at his home the Villa Solbacken in Stockholm in 1997, with Princess Lilian at his side. His remains were buried at the Royal Cemetery in Haga Park.

The newsletter is the most common form of serial publication. About two thirds of newsletters are internal publications, aimed towards employees and volunteers, while about one third are external publications, aimed towards advocacy or special interest groups. History In ancient Rome, newsletters was exchanged between officials or friends. By the Middle Ages, they were exchanged between merchant families. Trader's newsletters covered various topics such as the availability and pricing of goods, political news, and other events that would influence trade. These commercial newsletters were in effect, the first \\"serious\\" outlet for news publishing, from which evolved newspapers. The first full \\"newspaper\\" was Relation of Strasbourg, printed in 1609 by Johann Carolus. Many rivals soon followed, such as the German Avisa Relation oder Zeitung and the Dutch Nieuwe Tijdingen. By the end of the 17th century, several newspapers were established all across Europe, and were often translated into other languages. By the late 17th century, several governments were censoring newspapers, which harmed their development. Wars, like the Thirty Years' War, also imposed restrictions on trade, which could lead to shortage of paper in addition to censorship. Government censorship remains in effect in several countries to this day, although several countries now have laws guaranteeing freedom of the press.

It is located immediately east of the Canadian Rockies, west of Lethbridge and south of Calgary.  History  For centuries before European settlers reached this area and inhabited it, Aboriginal clans of the Blackfoot, Peigan and Kootenai passed through, lived in or frequented the region. The town received its name in 1868 when a group of prospectors lost a pincer in the small creek at this location. These pincers would have been used as a device for trimming the feet of the horses and thus had some value to the group. In 1874, the North-West Mounted Police came to southern Alberta. One of them discovered the rusting tools in the creek, and they named the area Pincher Creek. Pincher Creek was officially listed as a place name in the Geological Survey Report, 1880. In 1876, the NWMP established a horse farm in the area. It closed in 1881, but many of the troops stayed to help the town. James Schofield opened Pincher Creek's first store in 1884. By 1885 Pincher Creek had a store known as Schofield & Hyde General Store. Harry Hyde succeeded Schofield as Pincher Creek's first postmaster. In 1898, Pincher Creek was incorporated a village. In 1906, the community was officially incorporated as a town and named Pincher Creek. Many residents are descendants of the pioneer families who settled there over 100 years ago.  Geography = Cityscapes  Climate  Strong Chinook winds often blow off the mountains and Pincher Creek can be extremely windy. The Oldman River and Castle River valleys seem to act as a kind of funnel for air masses, arguably making the area around Pincher Creek the windiest in Alberta. Any typical day may see wind speeds of 50‚Äì90 km/h, the most violent recorded wind being 177 km/h. The strong winds have given rise to a significant amount of wind farm development in the area, with the towers and blades of wind turbines being a characteristic of the scenery. Another consequence of the breezy conditions is that the weather is mostly sunny and very dry as the wind tends to dissipate cloud cover. The town was severely affected by a flood that hit the area in 1995 as the peak stream flow discharge of the creek that gave the town its name was 271 cubic meters per second. On January 10, 1962, a dramatic weather change happened in the area. The temperature in the area rose by 41¬∞C (74¬∞F) from -19¬∞C to 22¬∞C (-2¬∞F to 72¬∞F) in only a few hours.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Pincher Creek recorded a population of 3,642 living in 1,490 of its 1,589 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 3,685. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. The population of the Town of Pincher Creek according to its 2013 municipal census is 3,619, a 2.5% decrease from its 2008 municipal census population of 3,712. In the 2011 Census, the Town of Pincher Creek had a population of 3,685 living in 1,500 of its 1,581 total dwellings, a 1.7% change from its 2006 population of 3,625. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.  Attractions  The Kootenai Brown Pioneer Village is a popular tourist stop open year-round. It was named after Kootenay Brown, who was the founder of Waterton Park. The six acre site is home to over twenty-three historical buildings, all on open exhibit.

Created by Stan Lee, Ernie Hart, and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales to Astonish #44 (June 1963). She is usually depicted as having the ability to shrink to a height of several centimeters, fly by means of insectoid wings, and fire bioelectric energy blasts. She is a founding member of the Avengers as well as a longtime leader of the team. In May 2011, the Wasp placed 99th on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time list, and 26th in their list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\" in 2012.

She was a founding member of the Avengers, appearing in the first issue and giving the team its name. It is with the Avengers that Janet became most well known. At first she was the weak link of the team, but later on became one of the smartest and craftiest of its members.

She then appeared as a member of the Avengers Unity Squad in Uncanny Avengers. Design In his 1970s run on The Avengers, artist George P√©rez revamped the character's costume a number of times, having a significant impact on the character's development: > It became a joke. In the case of the Wasp, I noticed that she has so many > costumes that eventually I said \\"Why not?\\" I think I was on the book long > enough what was once just a little bit of idiosyncrasy about the character > became fully part of the character's persona. Fictional character biography=1960s The \\"Winsome Wasp\\" depicted by John Buscema as a 1960s glamor girl Janet van Dyne was born in Cresskill, New Jersey, the socialite daughter of wealthy scientist Vernon van Dyne.

In order to avenge her father's death, she undergoes a biochemical procedure that grants her the ability to grow wings upon shrinking under four feet tall and uses a supply of \\"Pym particles\\" by which to change her size. Together, she and Ant-Man defeat the alien and avenge her father. Janet decides to remain as Wasp and be Hank's partner as she has fallen in love with him, though Hank initially rejects her feelings due to the similarities between her and his murdered first wife.Tales to Astonish #44 During her time as Hank's partner, she took part in numerous conflicts with villains who included the Porcupine, Egghead, and Whirlwind (then known as the Human Top).

Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Making use of the cellular implantation of sub-atomic Pym particles, the Wasp possesses the power to alter her physical size, causing her body's mass to be shunted to or gained from an alternate dimension known as Kosmos. She is able to shrink to a minimum of several centimeters or grow to a maximum of several hundred feet. Smaller or larger sizes are possible but the exertion puts a strain on her body. Initially, these abilities stem from use of a Pym particle gas released from special capsules, and later biochemical augmentation by Henry Pym. Over time, however, her body absorbs enough particles to cause cellular mutation due to repeated exposure to Pym particles, allowing her to alter her size at will. At miniature size, her strength level increases as her body's mass is compacted. At giant size, her strength and endurance increase geometrically with her height, reaching superhuman levels. Despite the advantages of giant size, Janet usually prefers to remain the diminutive Wasp, calling on her growth power only in times of extreme emergency. At miniature size, the Wasp grows a pair of translucent insect wings from her back, a result of genetic modifications provided by Hank Pym. These grant her the power of flight, at speeds up to . The Wasp is able to harness and augment her body's natural bio-electric energy, releasing it from her hands in powerful electrical force bursts, which she calls her \\"stinger blasts\\", \\"stingers\\", or \\"wasp's stings\\". Originally, she requires special wrist devices to produce these, but again, Pym particle absorption allows her to create the ability unaided. The Wasp's genetic modifications also grant her the ability to sprout small prehensile antennae from her temples which allowed her to telepathically communicate with and control insects. However, this is an ability she rarely uses. Van Dyne displays several non-superhuman abilities that garner her special fame and attention, foremost of which is her fashion sense; in nearly all of her early appearances, she sports a new costume, presumably designed and manufactured on her own as she is a gifted fashion designer. She is also a skilled amateur screenwriter. The Wasp is trained in unarmed combat by Captain America and in combat utilizing her special powers by Henry Pym. In addition, the Wasp is one of the most intuitive, if not deductive, members of the Avengers, and is an experienced leader and strategist. She effectively determines that a chemical accident has created a schizophrenic break in HenryThe Avengers #59‚Äì60 and that the relationship between the Scarlet Witch and the Vision is the result of the infused personality of Wonder Man, and guesses Iron Man's identity of Tony Stark. Other characters named Wasp=Hank Pym After the apparent death of Janet van Dyne, her ex-husband Hank Pym became the second Wasp and joined the Mighty Avengers as their leader. After founding the Avengers Academy, Pym returned to wear his Giant-Man suit, and helped the Avengers to rescue Janet from the Microverse. Nadia van Dyne It was revealed that Hank Pym had a daughter named Nadia through Maria Trovaya who was abducted and supposedly killed by foreign agents. This caused Nadia to be raised in the Red Room until the day she obtained a Pym Particle sample that enabled her to escape.All-New, All-Different Avengers #9 Upon heading to where her father lived, Nadia learned about what happened to Hank and used some parts of her father's costume and some materials laying around where she created a new version of the Wasp suit.Free Comic Book Day Avengers 2016 Upon becoming the third Wasp, Nadia plans to obtain the admiration of her father's allies. After earning the trusts of the Avengers after stabilizing Vision, Edwin Jarvis took Nadia on a road trip to meet her extended family. Nadia meets Janet and spends the day with her. They save the president and then have a moment together.All-New, All-Different Avengers #12 It soon becomes apparent that Nadia was out of touch with reality, believing that everything could be fixed by her science skills because \\"she was good\\". However, despite learning the harsh truth of reality, Janet comforted her and felt she had the potential to become a true hero.All-New, All-Different Avengers #14 Nadia soon joins the Avengers and gains U.S. citizenship. Upon realizing that the most intelligent women on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s index don't list any women above the 27th place, she jump starts the program G.I.R.L. ( _G_ enius _I_ n Action _R_ esearch _L_ abs) to look for women with genius intellects.The Unstoppable Wasp #1-2 When deciding her legal name, Nadia realizes that she can't take the name 'Pym' as she never knew much about her biological mother and father. She decides to take the surname 'Van Dyne' as Janet was the only person there for her and believed in her success.The Unstoppable Wasp #8 Other versions=MC2 In the alternate future of the \\"MC2\\" universe, Henry Pym and Janet Pym are parents of two children (Hope Pym and Henry Pym, Jr.). Giant-Man later perishes on the last mission of the original Avengers, and the Wasp dies of a broken heart. Their parents' deaths motivate Hope to be the Red Queen to form the Revengers while Henry, Jr. turns into the Big Man and joins a government reform team. Marvel Adventures Janet van Dyne as Giant-Girl. From Marvel Adventures: The Avengers #13 (July 2007). Art by Leonard Kirk The Marvel Adventures: The Avengers series (set in its own continuity) features Janet van Dyne as Giant-Girl, showcasing her ability to grow rather than shrink, which she uses in combat. She is younger than her main universe counterpart and she cracks jokes along with her teammate Spider-Man. Issue 13 of the series reveals her origin as a wealthy socialite given access to size-changing Pym particles by scientist Henry Pym (here an employee of Janet's father rather than a superhero). Her maximum size is unknown, but she grows tall enough to catch a school. Instead of having her powers naturally, Janet requires a suit powered by Pym particles to change her size. Like her Earth-616 counterpart, Janet seems to change her costume regularly. The first costume is purple and black with a mask adorned with antennae that looks remarkably similar to the Giant-Man costume worn by Hank Pym in the mainstream universe. This costume allows her to grow while having the added effect of letting her control insects (though she never uses this power). This costume is later destroyed, and Janet wears a second costume that does not include a mask, as her secret identity had been revealed. Finally, Janet gains a third suit that allows her to both grow and shrink, with the suit changing in appearance depending on her size. While using this suit to shrink, she calls herself Wasp and has powers similar to her mainstream counterpart, such as flight, proportionally superhuman strength, and the ability to project bio-electrical stings. A recent preview of Marvel Adventures: the Avengers #19 has shown her wearing a costume which is primarily blue but has gold-yellow accents. Whether this costume increases her maximum size is yet to be seen. She also mentions that she has at least two brothers, although they have never been seen or given any names (see Marvel Adventures: The Avengers #3). Marvel Zombies The Marvel Zombies series features an alternate Wasp as one of the main characters. She is now a zombie, another victim of the virus that has infected nearly all her world's superhumans. After Earth's human population is almost entirely devoured, Wasp is one of the zombies who finally kills (and consumes) Magneto. The Wasp then discovers that Hank Pym has kept a secret food supply‚Äîa sedated and maimed Black Panther, held prisoner in Hank's lab. She confronts Hank, but he decapitates her by increasing in size and biting her head off in the struggle that follows. When the Black Panther later escapes the lab, he also takes the Wasp's still sentient head, which continues begging for food. He eventually reaches safety after encountering Magneto's surviving Acolytes. The Acolytes announce that they will study the Wasp, seeking a cure for the virus.Marvel Zombies 2 #3 (March 2008) An epilogue, five years later, shows the Wasp exploring the deserted Earth alongside the Acolytes. Her severed head is now sealed within a liquid-filled helmet, controlling a robotic body. Forty years later in \\"Marvel Zombies 2\\", her head is fixed on a more advanced machine with her head exposed to the air. She also develops romantic feelings toward one of the Acolyte survivors, a scientist named Reynolds. As she indicates, forty years with the Acolytes is far longer than the time she has spent with Hank. At one point, the two share a kiss. A long period without feeding seems to have cured her completely of the hunger. Now Black Panther's adviser and friend, she is forced to infect him when an Acolyte assassin attempts to kill him. This incident is orchestrated by Malcolm Cortez, the son of Fabian Cortez, wanting to take leadership from Black Panther. When the hunger resurfaces, she nearly eats Panther's wife before being stopped by him. Instead, they eat the assassin and they state they will go into isolation in order to control their hunger. This is a success. Multiple powered zombies soon threaten the colony. Wasp fights alongside Panther, Hawkeye (who had also been decapitated and inhabits Janet's own former cybernetic body), Forge, and a reformed Luke Cage and Spider-Man to save the people of New Wakanda from Firelord, Giant-Man, Wolverine, Gladiator, Hulk, Jean Grey and Iron Man seeking to finish off humanity and retain the inter-dimensional portal so they can enter a new universe. Eventually the zombies discover, as Janet has, that the hunger fades with time, and they stop their rampage only to have their numbers halved by the Hulk. Janet, along with the other remaining zombies (the new Colonel America, Spider-Man, Cage, Giant-Man, Wolverine and Black Panther), end up teleported to another universe by Malcolm Cortez.Marvel Zombies 2 #5 (May 2008) The Wasp ends in the dimension of 'Earth Z'. She leads an alien invasion of the zombie-infected Earth in an effort to quash the flesh-eating threat. She fails at this and is destroyed.Marvel Zombies Return #3 (2009) Deathlok Wasp During the period when she is presumed dead, a cyborg version of the Wasp appears in the Core, an underground city populated by robots.Secret Avengers #22 During a battle between the Descendants (the residents of the Core) and the Secret Avengers, Hawkeye encounters the cyborg Wasp. He muses that the cyborg must have been the reanimated corpse of Janet, and finds himself unable to harm her.Secret Avengers #24 This Wasp is later revealed to be from an alternate future where most of Earth's superheroes had been killed and rebuilt using Deathlok technology. After the death of her timeline's version of Hank Pym, the Deathlok Wasp attempts to kidnap and assimilate his Earth-616 counterpart.Secret Avengers #34 Marvel Mangaverse Janet Van Dyne is a Stark International employee who wears a suit which grants her plasma wings. Janet has a rivalry with Iron Girl. Wasp helps defend the energy well from Hydra and Namor. During Rings of Fate she is presumably killed by the Hand. Ultimate Marvel The Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Wasp is Janet Pym, a 26-year-old mutant and a member of the Ultimates. She holds two Ph.D.s (one known to be in molecular biologyThe Ultimates #5) and is portrayed as being of Asian descent. She is moderately fluent in German. Her mutant status remains hidden from the public but is known by Henry \\"Hank\\" Pym and S.H.I.E.L.D.. She can generate a glittering wasp-like sting which she discharges through her hands. Her bio-electric blast, when applied from within the ear to the brain, reverts the Hulk to Bruce Banner during the New York massacre. Side-effects of her insectoid genetics include the occasional consumption of bugs, forming her own larval nests, and laying egg-like constructs. During her college years, she shares a room with Betty Ross and starts seeing Henry. Henry is abusive to her early in their relationship and during college is known to have hit her at least twice, putting her head through a door on one occasion and splitting the roof of her mouth on another. Betty can also recall instances where Janet is missing chunks of hair. Janet also suffers from severe bulimia prior to joining the Ultimates. Hank's attempts at change through medication and enlistment in the Ultimates does not improve his behavior. As a result of Hank's humiliating loss against Hulk and simmering jealousy of Janet's friendship with Captain America (Steve Rogers), Hank and Janet fight viciously until Janet resorts to stinging and Hank commands an army of ants against her. Janet is found in a state of anaphylactic shock, caused by receiving multiple ant stings she has received while at wasp-size. Captain America, upon learning of Hank's violence, tracks down and beats Hank unconscious for Janet. Captain America's visits Janet after the fight left her exasperated and angry, stemming from embarrassment of her personal life now being public.The Ultimates #7‚Äì9 After stopping the Chitauri invasion, Captain America and Wasp reconcile as friends and slowly start dating, despite Hank's attempts at making amends. On one of their secret meetings, Janet later confesses to Hank, now classified as a security risk by S.H.I.E.L.D., that the generation gap between Captain America and herself, along with the elderly status of Steve's friends, put a large strain on their relationship. She walks out on Rogers and meets up with Hank in a bar.Ultimates 2 #6 During their invasion of America, the Liberators fail to take Wasp into account, discounting her as being no threat due to her abilities being those to make herself \\"smaller and weaker\\". Janet is able to make her way to the cells in the Triskelion where Captain America is being held under suspicion of the murder of Hawkeye's entire family. Though she is discovered and apparently subdued, she has already liberated her boyfriend. Though Captain America easily beats the Schizoid Man, he stops fighting when several super soldiers threaten to tear Wasp apart; she then surprises them all by using her stinging powers at her normal size for the first time, killing or incapacitating all the super soldiers at once.Ultimates 2 #9 At some point, Hank gives Janet a dose of the Giant-Man serum, which allows her to grow to gigantic proportions. At a larger size, Janet helps turn the tide in favor of American forces and crushes the Insect Queen with one stomp of her foot. It is unknown whether she can grow at will or whether this is a one-off experience.Ultimates 2 #12 During The Ultimates 3 miniseries, Janet becomes co-leader of the team, along with Captain America, and now sports a crimson- and-gold outfit and a mask. She begins to reconcile with her estranged husband, and later works with the Ultimates and Wolverine to stop the plans of Ultron.Ultimates 3 #1‚Äì5 She and Hawkeye frequently clash thanks to her teammate's almost suicidal nature.Ultimates 2 #4 Having gone missing during the flood in Ultimatum Wave, Hank Pym and Hawkeye search for her, only for Hawkeye to discover her body being eaten by the Blob.Ultimatum #2 Hank tells Hawkeye and Iron Man (Tony Stark) to take Wasp's body to activate \\"the Jocasta project\\".Ultimatum #3 There are several references to Wasp following her death. She is seen dining in Valhalla with other deceased superheroes during Thor's eulogy for Spider-Man (Peter Parker).Ultimate Comics: Ultimate Fallout #2 Her Wasp mantle is succeeded by the aggressive Red-Wasp,Ultimate Avengers #2 and by a series of \\"WASPS\\" robots which were eventually acquired by Mr. Morez (Modi).Ultimate Comics: Ultimates #15‚Äì16 Wasp was later revived alongside her fellow Ultimates when the Superflow that separated the different universes was destroyed by Maker and High Evolutionary.Ultimates 2 Vol. 2 #9 In other media=Television * Wasp appeared in The Marvel Super Heroes, voiced by Peg Dixon. * Wasp made a cameo appearance in the Fantastic Four episode \\"To Battle the Living Planet\\". * Wasp appeared in The Avengers: United They Stand, voiced by Linda Ballantyne. * Wasp is featured in The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Jennifer Morrison.

Counties highlighted in red are always included, while counties highlighted in pink are sometimes included. The Inland Northwest, historically and alternatively known as the Inland Empire, is a region of the American Northwest centered on the Greater Spokane Area, that includes all of Eastern Washington and North Idaho. Northeastern Oregon and Western Montana are also sometimes considered part of the Inland Northwest, but Western Montana generally is not considered part of the Inland Empire. Under some definitions, the Inland Empire also excludes Central Washington or Idaho County, Idaho. , the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the combined population of eastern Washington and north Idaho alone to be 2,240,645, comparable to that of New Mexico. Its Canadian counterpart, north of the border, is the British Columbia Interior. Significant urban centers include the Spokane‚ÄìCoeur d'Alene area and the Tri-Cities. There have been several proposals to politically unite the Inland Northwest. In the mid and late 1860s, there was a proposal centered on Lewiston in northern Idaho for a Columbia Territory to be formed in the region from parts of what is now eastern Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana.Merle W. Wells. \\"Territorial Government in the Inland Empire: The Movement to Create Columbia Territory, 1864-69.\\" The Pacific Northwest Quarterly. Vol. 44, No. 2 (April 1953), pp. 80-87. In 1901, another proposal was made, this time to combine the Idaho Panhandle with Eastern Washington to create the State of Lincoln. A third proposal was popularized in the late 1920s to consist of eastern Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana to the Continental Divide.  Counties  ;Washington: Adams, Asotin, Benton, Chelan, Columbia, Douglas, Ferry, Franklin, Garfield, Grant, Kittitas, Klickitat, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane, Stevens, Walla Walla, Whitman, and Yakima ;Idaho: Benewah, Bonner, Boundary, Clearwater, Idaho, Kootenai, Latah, Lewis, Nez Perce, and Shoshone Oregon (often included) : Morrow, Umatilla, Union, and Wallowa Montana (sometimes included; never included as part of the Inland Empire) : Flathead, Lake, Lincoln, Mineral, Missoula, Ravalli, and Sanders  Geography  The region is bounded by the Cascade Mountains on the west and the Rocky Mountains (following the spine of the remote and rugged Cabinet Mountains) on the east, the Blue Mountains of Oregon and foothills of the Wallowa Mountains to the south, southeast, and encompasses the Columbia river basin (or Columbia Plateau). Between the three mountain ranges are large, sweeping areas of semi- arid steppe, part of which has been irrigated due to the Columbia Basin Project, resulting in expansive farmland in central Washington. The Palouse, original home of the Appaloosa, is another major agricultural region located in the gently rolling hills of southeastern Washington and extending into Idaho. In northern Idaho, the Silver Valley is a mineral-rich region of the Coeur d'Alene Mountains noted for its mining heritage, dating back to the 1880s. Spokane, the region's largest city, is located near where the arid, and largely unforested Columbia plateau meets the lush forests of the Selkirk Mountains. The urban area stretches east into Idaho along the I-90 corridor through the Spokane River valley across the border of Idaho into the cities of Post Falls and Coeur d'Alene on the north bank of Lake Coeur d'Alene. The Northeastern Washington and Northern Idaho portion of the Inland Empire are mountainous and forested, and the crest of the Bitterroot Range of the Rocky Mountains forms part of the eastern boundary of the Inland Empire region, while the Columbia River forms a significant part of its southern boundary.

He is most famous for his passionate speeches, especially the \\"put your bodies upon the gears\\" address given at Sproul Hall, University of California, Berkeley on December 2, 1964. Savio remains historically relevant as an icon of the earliest phase of the 1960s counterculture movement. Early life Savio was born in New York City to a Sicilian-born Italian-American father who designed and manufactured restaurant equipment. Mario's mother was also of Italian ancestry (from Veneto), though born in the US, and worked as a retail salesperson. Both his parents were devout Catholics and, as an altar boy, Savio planned to become a priest. He graduated from Martin Van Buren High School in Queens at the top of his class in 1960 and then went to Manhattan College on a full scholarship as well as Queens College. When he finished in 1963, he spent the summer working with a Catholic relief organization in Taxco, Mexico helping to improve the sanitary problems by building facilities in the slums. His parents had moved to Los Angeles and that autumn he enrolled at University of California, Berkeley.Rorabaugh, pp. 21‚Äì22. In March the following year he was arrested while demonstrating against the San Francisco Hotel Association for excluding blacks from non-menial jobs. He was charged with trespassing, along with 167 other protesters. While in jail, a cellmate asked if he was heading for Mississippi that summer to help with the Civil Rights project. Activism During the summer of 1964, he joined the Freedom Summer projects in Mississippi and was involved in helping African Americans register to vote. He also taught at a freedom school for black children in McComb, Mississippi. In July, Savio, another white civil-rights activist and a black acquaintance were walking down a road in Jackson and were attacked by two men. They filed a police report where the FBI became involved. However, the case stalled until President Lyndon Johnson, who had recently signed the Civil Rights Act, allowed the FBI to look into it as a civil-rights violation. Eventually one of the attackers was found, charged with misdemeanor assault and fined $50. After Savio participated in the protests during Freedom Summer of the Civil rights movement, he was inspired to fight further against the violence he had witnessed. The violence and racism he came across in the South made him more rebellious to the unfair nature of the American Society and its treatment of minorities; it made him want change which in turn influenced him to be part of that change. When Savio returned to Berkeley after his time in Mississippi, he intended to raise money for SNCC, but found that the university had banned all political activity and fundraising. He told Karlyn Barker in 1964 that it was a question as to whose side one was on. \\"Are we on the side of the civil rights movement? Or have we gotten back to the comfort and security of Berkeley, California, and can we forget the sharecroppers whom we worked with just a few weeks back? Well, we couldn't forget.\\" Savio's part in the protest on the Berkeley campus started on October 1, 1964, when former graduate student Jack Weinberg was manning a table for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). He was arrested when he refused to provide identification. The University police had just put him into a police car when someone from the surrounding crowd yelled, \\"We can all see better if we sit down.\\" Soon those in front of and behind the police car starting sitting as the call \\"sit down\\" echoed through the crowd, trapping the car in the plaza. Savio, along with others during the 32-hour sit-in, took off his shoes and climbed on top of the car and spoke with words that roused the crowd into a frenzy. The last time he climbed on the police car was to tell the crowd of a short-term understanding that had been met with UC President Clark Kerr. Savio said to the crowd, \\"I ask you to rise quietly and with dignity and go home,\\" and the crowd did exactly what he said. After this Savio became the prominent leader of the newly formed Free Speech Movement. Negotiations failed to change the situation; therefore direct action began in Sproul Hall on December 2. There, Savio gave his most famous speech, on the \\"operation of the machine\\", in front of 4,000 people. He and 800 others were arrested that day. In 1967, he was sentenced to 120 days at Santa Rita Jail. He told reporters that \\"[he] would do it again\\". In April 1965, he quit the FSM because \\"he was disappointed with the growing gap between the leadership of the FSM ... and the students themselves.\\" \\"Bodies upon the gears\\" speech Also known as \\"Operation of the Machine\\", this speech is possibly Savio's most known work. Speaking on the steps of Sproul Hall, on December 2, 1964: FBI surveillance In 1999, the media revealed that Savio had been tailed by the FBI from the moment that he had climbed onto the police car in which Jack Weinberg was detained. He was followed for more than a decade \\"because he had emerged as the nation's most prominent student leader\\". There was no evidence that he was a threat or that he had any connection with the Communist Party, but the FBI decided he merited their attention because they thought he could inspire students to rebel. Even after he had left the FSM, the FBI called him to their Berkeley office. They told Savio that they had received letters of a threatening nature towards him, but they would not speak with Savio's attorney present. However, Savio would not agree, and instead criticized the FBI \\"for failure to make arrests and take action in the South where human rights are being violated every day\\". At this point the meeting ended. According to hundreds of pages of FBI files, the bureau: *Collected, without court order, personal information about Savio from schools, telephone companies, utility firms and banks and compiled information about his marriage and divorce. *Monitored his day-to-day activities by using informants planted in political groups, covertly contacting his neighbors, landlords and employers, and having agents pose as professors, journalists and activists to interview him and his wife. *Obtained his tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service in violation of federal rules, mischaracterized him as a threat to the president and arranged for the CIA and foreign intelligence agencies to investigate him when he and his family traveled in Europe. *Put him on an unauthorized list of people to be detained without judicial warrant in the event of a national emergency, and designated him as a \\"Key Activist\\" whose political activities should be \\"disrupted\\" and \\"neutralized\\" under the bureau's illegal counterintelligence program known as COINTELPRO. The investigation finally ended at the beginning of 1975 and at that point an investigation into the FBI's abuse of power began. Savio's ex-wife, Suzanne Goldberg, said that the \\"FBI's investigation of her and Savio [was] a waste of money and an invasion of privacy\\". Later life and death Between 1965 and his death, Savio held a variety of jobs, including as a sales clerk in Berkeley and instructor at Sonoma State University. In 1965, he married Suzanne Goldberg, whom he had met in the Free Speech Movement. Two months after their wedding, they moved to England because Savio was awarded a scholarship to the University of Oxford. While there, they had their first child, Stefan. Savio did not complete his degree at Oxford, and they moved back to California in February 1966. In 1968, he ran for state senator from Alameda County on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket, but lost to Nicholas C. Petris, a liberal Democrat. In 1980, he married a second time, to Lynne Hollander, an old acquaintance from the Free Speech Movement.Taylor, San Francisco Chronicle. He returned to study at San Francisco State University soon after. In 1984, he received a summa cum laude bachelor's degree in physics and earned a master's degree in 1989. In 1990, Savio and Hollander moved with their ten-year-old son to Sonoma County, California, where Savio taught mathematics, philosophy and logic at Sonoma State University. Savio had a history of heart problems and was admitted to Columbia-Palm Drive Hospital in Sebastopol, California, on November 2, 1996. He slipped into a coma on November 5 and died the following day, shortly after being removed from life support. Legacy A Memorial Lecture Fund was set up to honor Mario Savio upon his death. The MSMLF hosts an annual fall lecture on the University of California, Berkeley campus. Past lecturers include Howard Zinn, Winona LaDuke, Lani Guinier, Barbara Ehrenreich, Arlie Russell Hochschild, Cornel West, Christopher Hitchens, Adam Hochschild, Amy Goodman, Molly Ivins, Jeff Chang, Tom Hayden, Angela Davis, Seymour Hersh, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Naomi Klein, Elizabeth Warren, Robert Reich, and Van Jones. The Memorial Fund also set up the Mario Savio Young Activist Award to honor an outstanding young activist with a deep commitment to human rights and social justice and the qualities of leadership ability, creativity, and integrity. Recipients of the award since it was first bestowed in 1998 include Michael Leon Guerrero, Niki Fortunato Bas, Jia Ching Chen, Jim Keady, Harmony Goldberg, Genevieve Gonzales, Rocio Nieves, Jason West, Erin Durban (now Erin Durban-Albrecht), Noemi Ramos, Christopher Goodman, Patrisse Cullors, Julissa Bisono, Chelsea Chee, Timothy Den-Herder, Reyna Wences, Rigoberto Padilla-Perez, Ellen Choy, Josh Healey, Christsna Sot, Molly Katchpole, Howard Watts III, Melvin Willis, Zoe Wilmott, Ilecara Velez, Eli Garcia, Quentin Savage and Johnnie Turnage. In 1997, the steps of Sproul Plaza, from which he had given his most famous speech, were officially renamed the \\"Mario Savio Steps\\". Savio's famous speech is sampled in many songs including \\"We Are The New Ones\\" by Dope Stars Inc., \\"It's Up To You\\" by electro turntablist Steinski (& Mass Media); \\"No More Nervous Breakdown\\" from the album Shiva Space Machine by the Montreal band Me Mom and Morgentaler; \\"An Ounce Of Prevention\\" from the album On Little Known Frequencies by the band From Monument to Masses; \\"Timelessness\\" by the band Fear Factory; \\"The Movie's Over\\" by the Australian band Cog; \\"Article IV\\" by the Santa Cruz band Good Riddance; \\"Here Come The Pigs\\" by Deadsoul Tribe; \\"means of existence\\" by Phobia; \\"Telegraph Avenue\\" by punk band Rancid; and \\"Wretches and Kings\\" from the album A Thousand Suns by Linkin Park. It is also paraphrased in an episode of Battlestar Galactica (Lay Down Your Burdens, Part II), given by Chief Galen Tyrol, the head of a union. It is also used in the intro to the podcast of the Dean Blundell Show on 102.1 the Edge, Toronto's largest radio station. On March 12, 2011, at the end of an announcement by hacktivist group Anonymous of an attack, called the Empire State Rebellion, on the Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund, the Bank of International Settlements and the World Bank, an excerpt of Savio's speech was included. Since the onset of the Occupy movement in the United States in Fall 2011, Savio's speech and his activism have been cited many times. His speech has also been cited and referenced by Stephen Pastis's comic, Pearls Before Swine, by the main character, Rat. On October 16, 2012, the Sebastopol City Council rededicated the Downtown Plaza as the \\"Mario Savio Free Speech Plaza\\". On November 15, 2012 the \\"Mario Savio Speakers' Corner\\" was dedicated on the campus of Sonoma State University. At the ceremony, Lynne Hollander Savio told the audience, \\"I hope you will use this free speech corner often, to advocate and organize with dignity and responsibility for the causes you believe in.\\" Footage of him is prominently featured in the 1990 documentary film Berkeley in the Sixties. An actor playing Mario Savio appears in the 2017 movie The Post, where he speaks a few lines of Savio's most famous speech. Savio's \\"Bodies upon the gears\\" speech is repeatedly used in the 2017 film The Pirates of Somalia.

The family is cosmopolitan, with some 5,000 species in six subfamilies. Nearly all species are solitary (with the exception of some group-nesting Ageniellini), and most capture and paralyze prey, though members of the subfamily Ceropalinae are kleptoparasites of other pompilids, or ectoparasitoids of living spiders. In South America, species may be referred to colloquially as or , though these names can be generally applied to any very large stinging wasps. Furthermore, in some parts of Venezuela and Colombia, it is called , or \\"horse killers\\", while in Brazil some particular bigger and brighter species of the general kind might be called /, or \\"throat locker\\".  Morphology  Like other strong fliers, pompilids have a thorax modified for efficient flight. The metathorax is solidly fused to the pronotum and mesothorax; moreover, the prothorax is best developed in Pompilidae and Scoliidae because wasps in these families use their forelegs to dig. Anoplius nigerrimus Pompilids typically have long, spiny legs; the hind femur is often long enough to reach past the tip of the abdomen. The tibiae of the rear legs usually have a conspicuous spine at their distal end. The first two segments of the abdomen are narrow, giving the body a slender look. The pompilid body is typically dark (black or blue, sometimes with metallic reflections), but many brightly colored species exist. From a lateral view, its pronotum looks rectangular and it extends back to the tegulae, near the base of the wings. Most species are macropterous (having long wings), but a few brachypterous (short-winged) and apterous (no wings) species are known. Spider wasps are best distinguished from other vespoid wasps in having (in most species) a transverse groove bisecting the mesopleuron (the mesepisternal sclerite, a region on the side of middle segment of the thorax above the point where the legs join). Like other Vespoidea, they have antennae with 10 flagellomeres in the female and 11 in the male. Most Pompilidae have straight inner eye margins. The hind wings do not have a distinct claval lobe, but they have a distinctive jugal lobe. The hind leg has a tibial spur with a tuft or row of fine hairs. The legs are long and slender with the tips of the tibia (metatibia) long enough to extend beyond the tip of the abdomen (metasoma). Sexual dimorphism is not pronounced, although females are often larger than the males. Coloration and wing appearance vary greatly among the many species. General coloration is aposematic (warning off predators), generally based on black, often with markings of orange, red, yellow, or white. Larvae can also be identified by physical examination.  Distribution  Currently, the Pompilidae are split unequally into six subfamilies throughout most of the world. Ceropalinae and Notocyphinae contain two genera each and occur in Central and South America and Asia. The Epipompilinae contain a single genus and occurs in the Neotropics, the Australasian region, and the Afrotropical region. The Ctenocerinae contain two genera in the Neotropics, four in Australia and 11 in Africa. Pepsinae and Pompilinae are the most diverse, and the remaining genera are split between them.  Evolution  The oldest fossil currently known is an indeterminate fossil from the Early Eocene (Ypresian) Klondike Mountain Formation of Washington State, USA. Other fossil species are known from Dominican and Baltic ambers, the Florissant Formation and various other localities in Germany, France and Spain. Bryopompilus described from the mid Cretaceous Burmese amber was initially thought to belong to this family, however it was subsequently placed in its own family, the Bryopompilidae.  Ecology and behavior  Unlike many other families in the Aculeata, essentially all wasps in this family are solitary (nests made by a single female).CSIRO Fact Sheet Adult pompilids are nectar-feeding insects and feed on a variety of plants. Depending on genus and species, pompilids capture a variety of spiders for their larvae to feed on, covering nearly all free- living spider families, including tarantulas, wolf spiders (Lycosidae), huntsman spiders (Sparassidae), jumping spiders (Salticidae) (and baboon spiders (Harpactirinae), though any given pompilid tends to attack only a limited diversity of spiders. A female wasp searches the ground and/or vegetation for a spider, and upon finding one, stings it, paralyzing the spider. The targeted spider typically isn't able to kill the wasp, because the wasp can just fly out of reach, so at best the spider fights fiercely to escape.https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/death-match-tarantula-vs- wasp/ Tarantula hawks (Pepsini) do not attack when adult tarantulas are close to or in their burrows. Instead, the wasps seek out adult males who have left their burrows in search of females to mate with. In the open the wasp first uses its wings to beat air over the tarantula, deceiving the tarantula into thinking that it being targeted by a large bird so the tarantula reacts by curling up to appear smaller and less noticeable, which in turn makes the tarantula defenseless against the wasp's attack. However, Brazilian Wandering spiders (Phoneutria) and their predators have a different interaction dynamic, and the spiders often manage to defeat the hunting wasp. Once the spider is paralyzed, a female pompilid makes a burrow or flies or drags the spider to a previously made burrow.Spider Wasps Australian Museum Online Because of the large body size of their prey, tarantula hawks usually will either construct burrows near the site of attack or use the host's own burrow or tunnel. Pompilids typically provide each of their larvae with a single prey/host, which must be large enough to serve as its food source throughout its development. Typically, a single egg is laid on the abdomen of the spider, and the nest or burrow is closed so the larva can develop without disruption by other parasites or scavengers. The female wasp may then engage in spreading soil or other changes to the area, leaving the nest site inconspicuous. One species of spider wasp protects its nests by putting dead ants into the outermost chamber, where the ants' chemicals deter predators. Wasp dragging a spider to its nest The egg hatches and the larva feeds on the spider, breaking through the integument with its mandibles. As the larva feeds on its host, it saves the vital organs, such as the heart and central nervous system, for last. By waiting until the final larval instar, it ensures the spider will not decompose before the larva has fully developed. The larva has five instar stages before it pupates; no major morphological differences are noted between the first four instars, with the exception of size. At the conclusion of the final instar, the larva spins a durable silk cocoon, and emerges as an adult either later in the same season or overwinters, depending on the species and the time of year the larva pupates. Some ceropalines lay their egg on a still- active spider, only temporarily paralyzing it, and the wasp larva feeds externally by extracting hemolymph after the egg hatches. In time, the spider will die, and the mature wasp larva will then pupate. The size of the host can influence whether the wasp's egg will develop as a male or a female; larger prey often yield the (larger) females. Pepsis thisbe of the southwestern United States exhibits a direct correlation between adult wasp body length and the weight of its host spider, Aphonopelma echina. Because the size of a P. thisbe adult is determined by the size of the host provided for it by its mother, the seasonal frequency of host sizes implicitly will determine the size variation in adult wasps. In another study on Pepsis thisbe, chemosensory cues were shown to be used to detect specific hosts. Specific chemosensory cues attract the wasp to its prey, Aphonopelma echina, despite other host spiders of the same size and frequency being present. In studies on Pepsis grossa (formerly P. formosa), a pompilid of the southwestern United States, the wasps were found to have behavioral plasticity. Their hunting behavior concerning their host Rhechostica echina improved with experience. The time required to complete all behavioral components decreased with each spider killed. Concerning mating behavior, males acquire perch territories to scan for incoming receptive females. In studies on the tarantula wasp Hemipepsis ustulata, larger males are more likely to acquire perch territories and territorial males appear to increase their chances of mating because receptive females fly to perch sites held by said males. Spider-hunting wasp Anoplius dragging a spider larger than herself backwards across a sandy heath (four stages are shown in the composite image)  Sting = Toxins  The Pompilidae produce a venom, delivered when they sting, containing a variety of powerful neurotoxins named pompilidotoxin (PMTX). These inhibit the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, causing too much sodium to flow through neuron cell membranes, causing long bursts of nerve impulses (action potentials, and thus overstimulating these nerves. Alpha- and beta-PMTX are both small peptide chains of just 13 amino acids; alpha-PMTX has been studied in Anoplius samariensis, while beta-PMTX has been studied in Batozonellus maculifrons.  Schmidt pain index  In 1984, Justin O. Schmidt developed a hymenopteran sting pain scale, now known as the Schmidt sting pain index. In this index, a 0 is given to a sting from an insect that cannot break through human skin, a 2 is given for intermediate pain, and a 4 is given for intense pain. The scale rates stings from 78 different species in 42 different genera. Spider wasps of the genus Pepsis, also known as tarantula hawks, have a sting rating of 4. The sting is described as \\"blinding, fierce, and shockingly electric. A running hair dryer has been dropped into your bubble bath.\\" Only the sting of the bullet ant, Paraponera clavata, is ranked higher, with a 4+ rating.

Although he was listed as a legitimate pope in most modern lists of popes until the first half of the 20th century, the apparently uncanonical method by which he obtained the papacy led to his being removed from the quasi-official roster of popes, the Annuario Pontificio. As such, he is now considered an antipope by the Catholic Church. Life and reign Little is known about the life of Christopher; the lack of reliable, consistent sources makes it difficult to establish a concise biography. It is believed that he was a Roman, and that his father's name was Leo. He was cardinal-priest of the title of St. Damasus when he became pope. His predecessor, Leo V, was deposed and imprisoned, most likely around October 903. As it is believed that Leo died in prison, Christopher may be regarded as pope after his death. However, the account of Auxilius of Naples says that Sergius III murdered both Leo V and Christopher. An eleventh-century Greek documentMon. Gr√¶ca ad Photium pertinent., p. 160, ed. Joseph Hergenr√∂ther, Ratisbon, 1869. says that Christopher was the first pope to state that the Holy Ghost proceeded \\"from the Father and from the Son\\". However, the document claims that Christopher made this profession to Sergius, Patriarch of Constantinople. At that time, however, Nicholas Mystikos was Patriarch of Constantinople, making the account historically suspect. (Sergius I was Patriarch in 610‚Äì638, and Sergius II in 1001‚Äì1019.) Dethroning Christopher was driven from the antipapacy by Pope Sergius III (904‚Äì911). Hermannus Contractus contends that Christopher was compelled to end his days living as a monk.Chronicle of Hermannus Contractus, ad an. 904. However, the historian Eugenius Vulgarius says he was strangled in prison.Ernst D√ºmmler, Auxilius und Vulgarius (Leipzig, 1866), 160, 135. Legitimacy Some hold that Christopher was a legitimate pope, regardless of the illegitimate means by which he appears to have acquired the title. His name is included in all major catalogues of the popes through the early twentieth century.Liber Pontificalis, II, ed. Duchesne; Watterich, Pontificum Romanorum Vitae, I; and Origines de l'√âglise romaine, I, par les membres de la communaut√© de Solesmes, Paris, 1836. His portrait figures among the other likenesses of the popes in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome, and among the frescoes of tenth-century popes painted in the thirteenth century on the walls of the ancient church of San Pietro a Grado, outside Pisa. He was, moreover, acknowledged as pope by his successors. For example, in confirming the privileges of the Abbey of Corbie in France, Leo IX mentioned the preceding grants of Benedict and Christopher.Philipp Jaff√©, Regesta RR. Pont., I, n. 4212. This privilege is the only one of Christopher's acts that is extant.Philipp Jaff√©, Regesta RR. Pont., 3532, 2d ed. However, he has not been considered a legitimate pope since the first half of the 20th century and has been erased from the Annuario pontificios list of popes.

Its name means \\"rich well/pond\\". It is often thought that the name came to be because it was a place known for its abundance of oil. In reality, before oil was discovered, there existed a pond rich in fish, which gave origin to the city‚Äôs name. In the last century oil was discovered in the area. It has since been almost completely extracted. This has resulted in the decline of oil well exploration and drilling activities, though there are still many oil facilities. The city shares borders with the municipalities of Papantla, Tihuatl√°n, and Coatzintla, and stands on Federal Highway 180. The archaeological zone of El Taj√≠n is located approximately from Poza Rica. The area is tropical, with two beaches within one hour, Tuxpan, and Tecolutla, and one within 40 minutes east, Cazones. Mexico City is about from Poza Rica.Unlike most Mexican cities, it does not have old buildings because it is a new city founded officially on November 20, 1951. For that reason it has contemporary architecture with well- lined and designed streets with a modern look. While the petroleum industry features heavily amongst the industrial landscape in Poza Rica, the city also has a wide variety of other industries with a large middle class. As one of the largest and most populous cities in Veracruz, Poza Rica is an important industrial and commercial center, and a central hub for several road transportation lines. The city has recently seen much growth, with several shopping malls opening around the city. The city had an official population of 174,512 inhabitants and the municipality had 181,438 at the census of 2005. However, the Poza Rica metropolitan area, which includes the municipalities of Papantla, Tihuatl√°n, and Coatzintla, showed a total population of 458,330. Main Attractions Poza Rica is close to the Costa Esmeralda, the northern beaches of Veracruz, such as Tecolutla, Tuxpan, Cazones and Playa Esmeralda. The UNESCO World Heritage Site of El Tajin is away. The downtown area presents shopping opportunities. It has a high viewing point called \\"El cerro del abuelo\\" where it's possible to see the whole city and its \\"quemadores\\", big petroleum burners which were used to light the city in the early years. A few of them remain. The annual \\"Desfile del 18 de marzo\\" (March 18 Parade, \\"Petroleum Day\\") commemorates Mexican oil expropriation and has two parades, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The city's populace is predominantly young. Though there are few expatriates, a few English-language schools employ teachers for locals and PEMEX employees. Petroleum Day dancers  Economy  Recently the city has experienced a revival in economic activity, driven by investments in oil production by the parastatal PEMEX company. The economy is driven by trade, the petroleum industry, fashion, and tourism. This has brought a boom in trade, which together with its strategic location and concentration of services, causes a daily flow of residents from other towns, municipalities and nearby cities like Papantla, Guti√©rrez Zamora, Tecolutla, Mart√≠nez de la Torre and Tihuatl√°n in the state of Veracruz. This extends its area of influence of the neighboring towns and villages State of Puebla that converge to it for various reasons, among which are health, employment, education or shopping, as it is located in the major centers of supply, trade and services. The city of Poza Rica has three malls: Plaza Gran Patio Poza Rica, which contains the stores Suburbia, Walmart, VIPs, MM cinemas, Cinemex, Burger King, Solo Tennis, Playground, Casino, The Home Depot, Office Depot, Peter Piper Pizza, Church's Chicken, and Pizza Hut, among others; Crystal Square contains Chedraui and Liverpool; Poza Rica Square contains Soria supermarket, MM cinemas, Cinemex, Toy, KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), exa fm radio, and Burger King. Neighborhoods The city consists of five neighborhoods (The 5 Barrios de Poza Rica). *Poza Rica Center is the commercial center of the city. *52 is an area which is northeast of the city which also has markets and busy shopping centers and the GREAT PATIO Commercial Square. *Totolapa is the third area of the city located across the bridge of Poza Rica. *Petromex is one of the colonies where most of the pozarricenses, citizens of Poza Rica, reside. *Arroyo del Maiz is the area which houses the Tecnol√≥gico de Poza Rica, also Conalep School. Ruiz Cortinez Boulevard walkway Parks The city of Poza Rica has 36 parks. The most important are: *Parque Plaza March 18. It is the city's central park is located between Avenues Lazaro Cardenas and Calle 8 Norte. It has an auditorium for musical events. It also attracts young people who practice hobbies such as rollerblading and biking. *Juarez Park. It is the second- largest park in the city, located on 16th Avenue West. *Parque de las Americas. The park features all the flags of America, and is located on the hillside. Juarez Park Sights The city has 18 monuments.

Located in the Parque Ju√°rez. *Founders Library. Located in Chapultepec street corner in Colonia Francisco Sarabia Manuel Avila Camacho. Transport Public transport is the main means of transport of pozarricenses. Transport in the city are buses that take you to different areas of the city, as well as shared taxis. Poza Rica taxis are the tsuru model that move around the city. Central Bus Terminal: For land transport with the rest of the country, Poza Rica has three bus terminals: *The North Central, where more than 30 lines come from across the country (Estrella Blanca, ADO, Axis Gulf, First Plus, Chihuahuan, AU, PLATINUM ADO, ADO GL, Premium Green, Futura, Omnibus de Mexico) *the second terminal has access only to passengers going to the neighboring city of Tuxpan. (ADO Bus) *The third terminal is in the Petromex (Alternate Petroleum), which exits south of the country (Xalapa, Veracruz, Coatzacoalcos, Villahermosa, Ciudad del Carmen, Chiapas, etc.) El Taj√≠n National Airport in Tihuatl√°n serves Poza Rica.\\"DIRECTORIO DE OFICINAS DE VENTAS .\\" Aeromar. 4/7. Retrieved on December 18, 2010. Religion Most pozarricenses profess the Catholic faith, but there are groups of Pentecostals, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, evangelical Christians, and Baptists, among others. Urban culture In the city are various youth groups like emos, skaters, Punk, Rappers, Cholos, reggaeton, Rastafarians, metalheads, Goths, Darcketos, Popular, Zoot, and Hippies. Tourism Tourism is a major economic activities of the city as each year thousands of national and international tourists comes into the city, though most are from Mexico City, Guadalajara, Puebla, Pachuca, Monterrey, Tulancingo, Reynosa, Matamoros, McAllen, Dallas, and Houston. The main destinations are the beach which is just 45 kilometers from the city center as well as the archaeological site of El Tajin, where every year a summit is held. Another attraction is the Tajin Teayo Castle. Food As for the local cuisine, this is distinguished by typical regional dishes Totonac and Huastec, of which the best known is the Zacahuil, plus a variety of typical Mexican snacks, among which are sopes, bocoles, molotes, tlacoyos, enchiladas, and blanditas. Sports Football, baseball, and basketball are sports that are practiced in Poza Rica. The city has a third-rank football team. A professional division called Poza Rica Oil has a team in the second. Another division is called Los Lobos. During the oil splendor the city had a professional baseball team. The Ranger Soccer is considered high quality football. It excels in the football tournament of the Barrios, an event that is organized by the newspaper La Opini√≥n and of which the founder was Jos√© Hern√°ndez Soto, a character linked to major sporting events in the city. The city has a football stadium located at Heriberto Jara Corona in the northern part of the city, which is home to the Oilers in Poza Rica.  Geography  Map of Metropolitan Zone of the City. The administrative boundaries of the municipality are determined by the municipality northeast of Papantla, south to the town of Coatzintla and to the northwest by the municipality of Tihuatl√°n, separated from the latter by the course of the river Cazones.  Geology and relief  The center of the city sits in a small valley on the basin river Cazones, in the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico, with an average altitude of 60 m, although most of the land sits on uneven ground and mostly hills northeast of the city, among which is the Cerro del Meson, with a maximum height of 242 meters. The predominant soils are of the vertisol type, with a high content of clay forming expansive cracks in dry seasons. Since its inception, the rapid urban growth in extension exceeded the capacity of available flat land in the city, expanding the urban area to the northeast of the city, using increasingly uneven ground and hills bordering the town of Papantla, inhabiting the slopes of the hills that surround the city center.  Hydrography  Cazones River Sunrise on the banks of the city of Poza Rica The town of Poza Rica is located in the watershed of the river Cazones, this River 100 km long born in the mountainous region of Hidalgo and flows into the Gulf of Mexico, has a higher average annual runoff of 40 m¬≥/s in its mouth. The city is also surrounded by several Cazones River tributary streams such as the Mollej√≥n, Hueleque, Salsipuedes and Arroyo Corn, which is regularly affected by flooding the annual rainy season. Mexico's only nuclear power plant, Laguna Verde nuclear power plant, is about away, near the state's capital city of Xalapa, Veracruz.

Produced by Westland Helicopters, it came from the same P.531 programme as the British Army Westland Scout, and was based on the earlier piston-engined Saunders-Roe Skeeter. It fulfilled the requirement of the Royal Navy for a helicopter small enough to land on the deck of a frigate and carry a useful load of two homing torpedoes. The Wasp sunk one ship in combat, seriously damaging the ARA Santa Fe submarine in 1982 during the Falklands war. Design and development The increasing speed and attack range of the submarine threat, and the increased range at which this threat could be detected led to a Royal Navy requirement for a \\"Manned Torpedo- Carrying Helicopter\\" (MATCH). Contemporary shipboard weapons did not have the necessary range, therefore MATCH was in essence a stand-off weapon with the helicopter carrying the torpedo or other weapon to the target and being instructed when and where to drop it.Friedman 2006, pp. 245‚Äì246. Unlike the larger Wessex, the Wasp carried no sonar of its own, and was limited strictly to working in partnership with its parent ship, other ships or other ASW units.James 1991, pp. 347, 372. First Wasp at the SBAC show 1962, a month before the first flight The first prototype Saro P.531 flew on 20 July 1958,James 1991, p.365. with the prototypes being subject to detailed testing by the Royal Navy, including the evaluation of several different undercarriage layouts, before settling on the definitive arrangement. An order for a pre- production batch of two \\"Sea Scouts\\" was placed in September 1961. The first flight of the two pre-production Wasp took place on 28 October 1962.James 1991, pp.371‚Äì372. Full production soon commenced, 98 in total being procured for the RN. The Wasp successfully exported to Brazil, the Netherlands, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand and South Africa. 133 aircraft were built in total.Donald and Lake 1996, p.439. Wasp was essentially a navalised Scout, indeed it was originally to be called the Sea Scout, and differed mainly in design details. It had a unique 4-wheeled castering undercarriage that allowed the aircraft to be manoeuvred on small, pitching flightdecks. The Wasp had the ability of \\"negative pitch\\" from the rotor-blades which enabled the aircraft to \\"adhere\\" to the deck until the lashings were attached. Additional fuel tankage was installed in the cabin floor and both the tail boom and main rotor blades were foldable to allow stowage in the small hangars fitted to the first generation helicopter-carrying escorts. It was fitted with a winch above the starboard rear door, and also had the capacity to carry underslung loads from the semi automatic cargo release unit mounted under the fuselage. With a crew of 2 (Pilot and Missile Aimer/Aircrewman) and the capacity to seat 3 passengers Wasp was useful for short-range transport missions, and for casualty evacuation with room for one stretcher fitted across the rear cabin area. Later modifications included the ability to carry the Nord SS.11 wire- guided missile, with the fitting of the Aimers sight in the left cockpit roof and the installation of large inflatable emergency floats in sponsons on either side of the cabin to prevent capsizing of the top-heavy aircraft in the event of ditching. The SS.11 had limited range targeting small surface targets such as patrol boats or shore positions, and was later replaced by the AS.12, which effectively had double the range. Operational history=Royal Navy HMS Gatatea landing personnel on Aldabra atoll, Indian Ocean (1970) The Wasp HAS.1 was introduced to service in the small ships role in 1964, after an intensive period of trials by 700(W) IFTU between June 1963 and March 1964. It served in this primary role with 829 Naval Air Squadron, but also in training units to supply crews for the front line with 706 NAS between 1965 and 1967 and in 703 NAS between 1972 and 1981. Single airframes also served for light liaison duties in the Commando Assault squadrons, 845 NAS and 848 NAS until 1973. Although effective as a submarine killer, it was best deployed paired with a Wessex HAS.3 submarine hunter. In the late 1970s, the Westland Lynx started to replace the Wasp. On 25 April 1982 the Argentinian submarine was spotted by a Wessex helicopter from . The Wessex and a Westland Lynx HAS.2 from then attacked it with depth charges, a Mk 46 torpedo, and also strafed it with GPMG. A Wasp launched from and two Wasps launched from fired AS.12 anti- ship missiles at the submarine, scoring hits. Santa Fe was damaged badly enough to prevent her from submerging. The crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty on South Georgia and surrendered to the British forces, thus becoming the first casualty of the sea war, as well as the first direct engagement by the Royal Navy Task Force. The last Wasp was finally withdrawn from service in 1988 when the last of the Type 12 frigates was decommissioned. Royal Malaysian Navy Wasp of RMN in display at Sultan Abu Bakar Museum in Pekan, Pahang. The Wasp came into service with the Royal Malaysian Navy quite late, compared to the others nations who procured the aircraft. She joined the RMN on 8 April 1988. The Wasp had a relatively short career with that Navy, being phased out just ten years later when they were replaced by the Eurocopter Fennec. Royal New Zealand Navy The first four of an eventual nineteen Wasps were purchased by the Royal New Zealand Navy in 1966, being immediately assigned to the new frigate, . They provided numerous tasks, as well as taking part in the Armilla Patrol in the Persian Gulf during the 1980s. The Wasps were flown by RNZN pilots but maintained by ground crews of No. 3 Squadron RNZAF. In 1997, four Wasps performed a flypast, marking the arrival of the new frigate, HMNZS Te Kaha. The Wasp served 32 years with the RNZN, retiring in 1998, the same year HMNZS Waikato, which first operationally deployed the Wasp in New Zealand, was herself decommissioned. They were replaced by the SH-2 Seasprite as a stop gap until the Arrival of their SH-2G(NZ). Royal Netherlands Navy Koninklijke Marine, 1967 With the Royal Netherlands Navy beginning in the late 1960s, after the fire onboard , NATO anti-submarine commitments were taken over by a squadron of Westland Wasp helicopters, operated from six anti-submarine frigates. The shore base was at De Kooy. The Royal Netherlands Navy 860 Naval Air Squadron received 12 Wasp helicopters between November 1966 and June 1967, operated from Van Speijk-class frigates as AH-12As and flown in the ASW role. The last of the Dutch Wasps were eventually withdrawn from service in 1981 when they were replaced by the Westland Lynx. Other operators The Wasp was also in service with the Brazilian, Indonesian, and South African navies. The Indonesian aircraft are all former Dutch aircraft and were the last of the type in active service. The last of the ten surplus Dutch Navy helicopters refurbished by Westland's for the Indonesian Navy was grounded in 1998. Flown by 400 Squadron (RON 400) from NAS Juanda, and when at sea were embarked upon the Indonesian Navy's ex UK Royal Navy and ex-Dutch Navy s. The Brazilian Navy operated the Wasp as the UH-2 & UH-2A taking delivery of three new build helicopters in April 1966 and a further seven ex-Royal Navy helicopters in 1977. 1¬∫ Esquadr√£o de Helic√≥pteros de Emprego Geral (HU-1) flew the helicopters from Navy's and -class destroyers and the s. The South African Navy received their first batch of ten new build airframes in 1963, which was followed by the delivery of a second batch of further 8 from 1973. Although only six were delivered due to the International arms embargo placed on South Africa during the apartheid regime.

It was established in 1886. It is a predominantly black Pentecostal Holiness Christian denomination, and the International Headquarters is located in Greensboro, North Carolina. The UHCA consists of 516 churches, 17 districts, and 8 territories. The largest and the oldest district of the connectional body is the Southern District Convocation (Goldsboro, NC).  History  This church was organized as the outgrowth of what was called a \\"holiness revival\\", sparked by the meetings held by Isaac Cheshier at Method, North Carolina a suburb of Raleigh, North Carolina), in 1886. It began as a regional body. On October 13, 1894, in the city of Durham, North Carolina, the first convocation was organized. Those present were G.A. Mials, H.C. Snipes and S.S. Freeman, all of Raleigh, North Carolina; present also was G.W. Roberts of Durham, North Carolina, and L.M. Mason of Method, North Carolina. On October 15, 1900, a convention was called by the Rev. C.C. Craig to meet at Durham, North Carolina, to prepare a discipline for the government of the churches. Those present were H.C. Pettiford, H.C. Snipes, L.M. Mason, G.W. Roberts, Mrs. Emma E. Craig, and Mrs. L.J. Roberts. In the early 1900s, the church added a Pentecostal understanding. In 1900 this body called itself Holy Church of North Carolina, and later, as it grew, the Holy Church of North Carolina and Virginia. In 1916 the name United Holy Church of America was adopted, and the church was incorporated on September 15, 1918.

This was the first and the largest of all the districts in the connection. It was organized by Elders C.C. Craig, L.M. Mason, George W. Roberts, H.C. Snipes, and H.C. Pettiford, along with Mother E.E. Craig, and Mrs. L.J. Roberts. Elder L.M. Mason was chosen as its first president. The Virginia District was organized by Bishop W.N. Strobhar. Bishop Thomas E. Talley was appointed the first president, and Bishop S. G. McCoy served as vice president. The first convocation was held in August 1969 in Portsmouth, Virginia, and Mrs. Elsie Harris served as its first secretary. The Southeastern District, originally known as the Florida-Georgia District, was organized in 1948 by Bishop G.J. Branch. On December 10, 1969, at Fisher Memorial United Holy Church in Durham, North Carolina, the Western North Carolina District was organized by Bishop W.N. Strobhar and other General officers. Bishop A.W. Lawson was appointed the first president, and Bishop N.M. Midgett was chosen to serve as vice president. In June 1920, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, bishops H.L. Fisher and G.J. Branch and other general officers met at a call-meeting of the independent group of Holy Churches in this city and nearby towns, and organized the churches into a district known as the Northern District Convocation of the United Holy Church of America, Inc. Bishop G.J. Branch of Goldsboro, North Carolina was chosen as the president of the district embracing the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Following this, in 1924, in the city of Columbus, Ohio, at the Gospel Tabernacle Church, whose pastor was Elder John E. Harris, the Northwestern District was organized into a District Convocation by Bishop G.J. Branch, Bishop H.L. Fisher, and Bishop J.D. Diggs, along with other General officers of the Church. Bishop J.D. Diggs of Winston-Salem, North Carolina was chosen as its first president. Other officers were Bishop H.H. Hairston and Bishop S.G. McCoy. The states comprising this district were Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, West Virginia, Western Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Eastern Illinois. The West Virginia District was organized in 1935 through the work of Bishop J.D. Diggs after being separated from the Northwestern District the previous year. The New England District, embracing the states of the New England area, was organized in August 1925. Bishop J.W. Houston was chosen as the first president of this district. The Central Western District was organized in 1930. The organizers were Bishop J.W. Houston, Elder Otis E. Evans, Mother Addie Houston, and Mother Susie Evans. The United Holy Church district on the Pacific Coast was originally known, in 1924, as the Union of California United Holy Churches. In 1936 this district was named the Pacific Coast District, and later the Western District. The first headquarters for the district was in Los Angeles, and later in San Francisco. Bishop Henry Lee Fisher was the chief organizer of this district. The Central Pacific District was founded in March 2005 with Bishop Rafael Fortier, Jr., as its first president. The district began with its headquarters in San Francisco, California. Internationally, the Bermuda District, covering the entire island of Bermuda, was organized in 1921 by Bishop Henry Lee Fisher. Associated with him in this effort were Elders Thomas Trott, C. H. Caisey and Patrick Mills, and Miss Majorie Trott. In the early history of the Barbados District, Evangelist Rosa B. Hawkins of San Francisco, California, organized five churches on the island of Barbados; however, these churches later joined with another Pentecostal body. The churches in Barbados that are presently a part of The United Holy Church of America were organized by the late Bishop Harry Townsend Gentles. He founded Mt. Olive United Holy Church in 1949, and it later became the headquarters church for the District. Bishop Gentles brought together some independent churches and organized new ones as well. These churches grew into the present-day Barbados District. United Holy Church of America Governance General President, General Vice-President, and General 2nd Vice-President, Bishops' Council, General Board of Bishops, Board of Elders (district and general church levels), District Board of Presbytery, District Presidents, District Elders, District & General Departments of Evangelism & Extension, Missions, Ushers, Music, YPHA (Young Peoples' Holy Association), BCS (Bible Church School), Publications, and the Holiness Union . The United Holy Church is broken down into districts, sub- districts and then local churches. Divisions and Reunion From January 1927 to March 1975, the Church experienced a breach in its Certificate of Incorporation. Through a Certificate of Rescission and a resolution passed at a General meeting, the Certificate of Incorporation was amended to allow the Church to exist as a perpetual institution. The Church's corporate status as a non-profit religious organization now exists in perpetuity. The Tenth Article of the 1918 Certificate of Incorporation was amended to reflect this change. In 1977, the Church divided when the Southern District Convocation, located in Goldsboro, North Carolina withdrew from fellowship with the parent body. However, in May 2000 in the city of Greensboro, North Carolina, the Southern District Convocation was reunited with the connectional body at the Quadrennial Session. Mount Calvary Holy Church of America split from the United Holy Church in 1929 to form their own holiness Pentecostal body. Mount Sinai Holy Church of America separated from the mother church in 1924 to form an organization to create gender equality in episcopal ordination.

The term was coined in Ars Magica, where it referred to each player using multiple characters and, crucially, sharing a pool of characters held in common by the entire group (referred to as the \\"troupe\\").Jonathan Tweet and Mark Rein*Hagen. Ars Magica, 2nd Edition, 1989 Troupe Play in Ars Magica In Ars Magica, the troupe's characters all belong to a single Covenant - a small group dedicated to the study and utilization of the magical arts. Each player's primary character is their Magus, one of the wizards who form the core of the Covenant. Each player also creates a Companion, a \\"skilled person who aids magi but is not necessarily in their pay.\\" Finally the group (or troupe) as a whole creates a number of Grogs, mercenaries and other servants hired by the magi. A typical session of Ars Magica features one player running their Magus while the other players take on the role of either a Companion or Grog. The Grogs are a communal asset, and, thus, over the course of several sessions the same grog may be played by several different players. The Ars Magica rulebooks also provide for a single player taking on \\"secondary roles\\" and playing multiple characters simultaneously (a Magus and their Companion, for example, or multiple Grog). It is also noted that, \\"since players switch characters, it is easy to switch storyguides from story to story as well.\\" neither of these features, however, is considered the primary defining trait of \\"troupe-style play\\", although they are common features in many Ars Magica campaigns.https://web.archive.org/web/20040225113837/http://redcap.org/FAQ/FAQ1a.html Other Examples of Troupe Play Troupe-style play can also be found in other role-playing games, such as Circle of Hands, (which actually prohibits any player from playing the same character two sessions in a row)http://adept- press.com/games-fantasy-horror/gray-magick/about-circle-of-hands/, and Shock: Human Contact, a science fiction game which starts with a session on a research ship, then a session on a colony, and then additional sessions where characters can be selected from either location.Shock: Human Contact 1.0, Joshua A.C.

Early life and family Mabo was born Edward Koiki Sambo but changed his surname to Mabo when he was adopted by his uncle, Benny Mabo. This adoption was part of traditional Torres Strait Islander adoption practices. He was born on the island of Mer (Murray Island) in the Torres Strait between mainland Queensland and Papua New Guinea. Mabo married Bonita Neehow, an Australian South Sea Islander, in 1959. The couple had seven children and adopted three more. One daughter, Gail, is an Aboriginal artist and dancer who works with schools in New South Wales as a cultural advisor and serves as the family's designated spokesperson. Bonita Mabo died in Townsville on 26 November 2018, aged 75, just days after receiving an honorary doctorate of letters from James Cook University for her contributions to social justice and human rights. Mabo's nephew was Anglican Bishop Saibo Mabo. Career Mabo worked on pearling boats, as a cane cutter, and as a railway fettler before becoming a gardener at James Cook University in Townsville, Queensland at age 31. In 1973, Eddie and Bonita Mabo established the Black Community School in Townsville, where children could learn their own culture rather than white culture. The time Mabo spent on the campus had a massive impact on his life. In 1974, he was talking with James Cook University historians Noel Loos and Henry Reynolds, and Loos recalls: > we were having lunch one day in Reynolds' office when Koiki was just > speaking about his land back on Mer, or Murray Island. Henry and I realised > that in his mind he thought he owned that land, so we sort of glanced at > each other, and then had the difficult responsibility of telling him that he > didn't own that land, and that it was Crown land. Koiki was surprised, > shocked and even ... he said and I remember him saying 'No way, it's not > theirs, it's ours.' See also Later, when Mabo was a research assistant on an oral history project in the Torres Strait, Reynolds records: > He got as far as Thursday Island and no further. He was refused permission > to land on any of the other islands in the Straits. A reputation as a > radical was a heavy burden in Queensland at the time. For Eddie the > rejection was devastating. He could not go home. He was not only landless in > the eyes of white man's law, he was an exile as well.Id., p. 186. Land rights advocate In 1981 a land rights conference was held at James Cook University and Mabo gave a speech in which he explained the land inheritance system on Murray Island. The significance of this in terms of Australian common law doctrine was noted by one of the attendees, a lawyer, who suggested there should be a test case to claim land rights through the court system. Perth-based solicitor Greg McIntyre was at the conference and agreed to take the case; he then recruited barristers Ron Castan and Bryan Keon-Cohen. McIntyre represented Mabo during the hearings. Of the eventual outcome of that decision a decade later, Reynolds said: \\"it was a ten-year battle and it was a remarkable saga really.\\" Death and Mabo decision On 21 January 1992, Eddie Mabo died of cancer at the age of 55. Five months later, on 3 June 1992, the High Court announced its historic decision to overturn the legal doctrine of terra nullius, a term applied to the attitude of the British towards land ownership in Australia. That decision, formally \\"Mabo v Queensland (No 2)\\", now commonly called \\"Mabo\\" in Australia, is recognised for its landmark status. Three years after Mabo died, that being the traditional mourning period for the people of Murray Island, a memorial service was held in Townsville. Overnight, Mabo's gravesite was attacked by vandals who spray- painted swastikas and the word \\"Abo\\" (a derogatory slang term for Aboriginal people) on his tombstone and removed a bronze bas-relief portrait of him. His family decided to have his body reburied on Murray Island. On the night of his reinterment, the Islanders performed their traditional ceremony for the burial of a Meriam king, a ritual not seen on the island for 80 years.  Legacy  In 1992, Mabo was posthumously awarded the Australian Human Rights Medal in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Awards, together with the Reverend Dave Passi, Sam Passi (deceased), James Rice (deceased), Celuia Mapo Salee (deceased) and Barbara Hocking (deceased). The award was in recognition \\"of their long and determined battle to gain justice for their people\\" and the \\"work over many years to gain legal recognition for indigenous people's rights\\". In 1993 The Australian newspaper commemorated his work by voting him the 1992 Australian of the Year (not to be confused with the official Australian of the Year awards issued by the Australian Government). A documentary, Mabo: Life of an Island Man, directed by Trevor Graham, was released in 1997 and received the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Documentary. On 21 May 2008, James Cook University named its Townsville campus library the Eddie Koiki Mabo Library. Mabo Day is an official holiday in the Torres Shire, celebrated on 3 June. On 10 June 2012, Mabo, a television drama based on Mabo's life, was broadcast on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). On 24 August 2015, Tony Abbott became the first Prime Minister of Australia to visit Mabo's grave on Murray Island, where he paid tribute to his legacy. In 2016, Google Doodle commemorated his 80th birthday. In 2017, the Royal Australian Mint issued a 50-cent coin commemorating 25 years since Mabo's death and the legal decision and 50 years since the referendum. It was designed by his granddaughter Boneta-Marie Mabo and released in National Reconciliation Week.

The original TI-83 is itself an upgraded version of the TI-82. Released in 1996, it was one of the most popular graphing calculators for students. In addition to the functions present on normal scientific calculators, the TI-83 includes many features, including function graphing, polar/parametric/sequence graphing modes, statistics, trigonometric, and algebraic functions, along with many useful applications. Although it does not include as many calculus functions, applications and programs can be written on the calculator or loaded from external sources. The TI-83 was redesigned twice, first in 1999 and again in 2001. TI replaced the TI-83 with the TI-83 Plus in 1999. The redesign introduced a design very similar to the TI-73 and TI-83 Plus, eliminating the sloped screen that had been common on TI graphing calculators since the TI-81, and included Flash memory, enabling the device's operating system to be updated if needed, or for large new Flash Applications to be stored, accessible through a new Apps key. The Flash memory can also be used to store user programs and data. In 2001, the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition was released, which featured approximately nine times the available flash memory, and over twice the processing speed (15 MHz) of a standard TI-83 Plus, all in a translucent grey case inlaid with small \\"sparkles\\". The 2001 redesign (nicknamed the TI-83 \\"Parcus\\"TI-83 Parcus - DATAMATH) introduced a slightly different shape to the calculator itself, eliminated the glossy grey screen border, and reduced cost by streamlining the printed circuit board to four units.  Additional models = TI-83 Plus  The TI-83 Plus was designed in 1999 as an upgrade to the TI-83. The TI-83 Plus is one of TI's most popular calculators. It uses a Zilog Z80 microprocessor running at 6 MHz, a 96√ó64 monochrome LCD screen, and 4 AAA batteries as well as backup CR1616 or CR1620 battery. A link port is also built into the calculator in the form of a 2.5mm jack. The main improvement over the TI-83, however, is the addition of 512 kB of Flash ROM, which allows for operating system upgrades and applications to be installed. Most of the Flash memory is used by the operating system, with 160 kB available for user files and applications. Another development is the ability to install Flash Applications, which allows the user to add functionality to the calculator. Such applications have been made for math and science, text editing (both uppercase and lowercase letters), organizers and day planners, editing spread sheets, games, and many other uses. Designed for use by high school and college students, though now used by middle school students in some public school systems, it contains all the features of a scientific calculator as well as function, parametric, polar, and sequential graphing capabilities; an environment for financial calculations; matrix operations; on-calculator programming; and more. Symbolic manipulation (differentiation, algebra) is not built into the TI-83 Plus. It can be programmed using a language called TI-BASIC, which is similar to the BASIC computer language. Programming may also be done in TI Assembly, made up of Z80 assembly and a collection of TI provided system calls. Assembly programs run much faster, but are more difficult to write. Thus, the writing of Assembly programs is often done on a computer.  TI-83 Plus Silver Edition  TI-83 Plus Silver Edition The TI-83 Plus Silver Edition was released in 2001. Its enhancements are 1.5 MB of Flash memory, a dual-speed 6/15 MHz processor, 96 kB of additional RAM (but TI has yet to code support for the entire RAM into an OS), an improved link transfer hardware, a translucent silver case, and more applications preinstalled. This substantial Flash memory increase is significant. Whereas the TI-83+ can only hold a maximum of 10 apps (or more often less, dependent on size), the Silver Edition can hold up to 94 apps. It also includes a USB link cable in the box. It is almost completely compatible with the TI-83 Plus; the only problems that may arise are with programs (e.g. games) that may run too quickly on the Silver Edition or with some programs which have problems with the link hardware. The key layout is the same. A second version of the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition exists, the ViewScreen‚Ñ¢ (VSC) version. It is virtually identical, but has an additional port at the screen end of the rear of the unit, enabling displays on overhead projectors via a cable and panel. It looks similar to the standard TI-83 Plus, but has a silver-colored frame, identical to the standard Silver Edition, around the screen. The TI-83 Plus Silver Edition is listed on the Texas Instruments website as \\"discontinued.\\" In April 2004, the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition was replaced by the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition. They feature the same processor and the same amount of Flash memory, but the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition features a built in USB port, clock, and changeable faceplates.

C requires a computer with a Z80 cross-compiler or an on-calc assembler.  Programming  The TI-83 Plus series are very similar in the languages natively supported by the calculator. These include \\"TI-BASIC\\", an interpreted language used by all of TI's calculators, and \\"TI-ASM\\", an unofficial name for the native Z80 assembly language on which the calculator is based.  TI-BASIC  TI-BASIC is the built in language for TI-83 series calculators, as well as many other TI graphing calculators. TI-BASIC is a non-structured programming language, meaning it is arranged sequentially, without the use of methods or organized blocks of code. Due to its simplicity and the ubiquity of TI calculators in school curricula, for many students it is their first experience with programming. Below is an example of a hello world program equivalent to the assembly language example. :ClrHome :Disp \\"Hello World!\\"  Assembly language  The TI-83 was the first calculator in the TI series to have built in assembly language support. The TI-92, TI-85, and TI-82 were capable of running assembly language programs, but only after sending a specially constructed (hacked) memory backup. The support on the TI-83 could be accessed through a hidden feature of the calculator. Users would write their assembly (ASM) program on their computer, assemble it, and send it to their calculator as a program. The user would then execute the command \\"Send (9prgmXXX\\" (where XXX is the name of the program), and it would execute the program. Successors of the TI-83 replaced the Send() backdoor with a less-hidden Asm() command. Z80 assembly language gives a programmer much more power over the calculator than the built-in language, TI-BASIC. On the downside, Z80 assembly is more difficult to learn than TI-BASIC. Z80 assembly language can be programmed on the computer and sent to the calculator via USB port, written by hand directly into the program editor (using the hexadecimal equivalents to the op-codes) or compiled using third party compiler programs. Programs written in assembly are much faster and more efficient than those using TI-BASIC, as it is the processor's native language, and does not have to be interpreted. An example program that displays \\"Hello World!\\" on the screen is given. Note that b_call() is not an instruction, but a macro (syntactic sugar) for calling an OS routine. .nolist ; Standard header #include \\"ti83plus.inc\\" .list .org userMem-2 .db t2ByteTok,tAsmCmp Main: b_call(_ClrScrnFull) ; Clears the screen b_call(_HomeUp) ; Moves the cursor to the top-left corner of the screen ld hl,Hello ; Loads the address that points to \\"Hello World\\" into register hl (16-bit) b_call(_PutS) ; Displays \\"Hello World\\" on the screen ret ; Pops the last value pushed onto the stack into the program execution register ; May be used to end the program depending on what's on the stack Hello: ; Gives the label an equate address in memory .db \\"Hello World!\\",0 ; The hex values of \\"Hello World\\" are stored in program data .end ; Marks the end of a file .end ; Two .ends must be used because of a bug in the standard compiler  Firmware replacement  TI continued to rely on RSA cryptographic signing keys only 512 bits long for many years after it was known that longer keys were necessary for security. 512-bit keys had been publicly cracked in 1999 as part of the RSA Factoring Challenge.Herman te Riele (1999-08-26), New factorization record (announcement of factorization of RSA-155). Retrieved on 2008-03-10. In 2009, a group of enthusiasts used brute force and distributed methods to find all of the cryptographic signing keys for the TI calculator firmware, allowing users to directly flash their own operating systems to the devices. The key for the TI-83+ calculator was first published by someone at the unitedti.org forum. They needed several months to crack it. The other keys were found after a few weeks by the unitedti.org community through a distributed computing project. Texas Instruments then began sending out DMCA take-down requests to a variety of different websites mirroring the keys, including unitedTI and reddit.com. They then became subject to the Streisand effect and were mirrored on a number of different sites, including WikiLeaks.  Successor  The TI-84 Plus series was introduced in April 2004 as a further update to the TI-83 Plus line. Despite the new appearance, there are very few actual changes. The main improvements of the TI-84 Plus and TI-84 Plus Silver Edition are a modernized case design, changeable faceplates (Silver Edition only), a few new functions, more speed and memory, a clock, and USB port connectivity. The TI-84 Plus also has a brighter screen with a clearer contrast, though this caused a bug with the LCD driver in some calculators sold. The TI-84 Plus has 3 times the memory of the TI-83 Plus, and the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition has 9 times the memory of the TI-83 Plus. They both have 2.5 times the speed of the TI-83 Plus. The operating system and math functionality remain essentially the same, as does the standard link port for connecting with the rest of the TI calculator series. While mobile devices and the internet have superseded any calculator's capabilities, standardized testing precludes the use of those devices. Furthermore, textbooks have been tailored for the TI-83 effectively giving the calculator a \\"monopoly in the field of high school mathematics.\\"  See also  * Comparison of Texas Instruments graphing calculators * Calculator Gaming * Cemetech * Small Device C Compiler * Z88DK  References  External links  * Features of the TI-83 Plus, and TI-83 Plus Silver Edition Texas Instruments Product Info * TI-83 Plus Guide Book Texas Instruments Product Documentation * How Texas Instruments Monopolized Math Class How students are using DonorsChoose to raise money to buy TI graphing calculators Category:Graphing calculators TI-83 Category:Products introduced in 1996 Category:Z80 ","title":"TI-83 series"},{"id":"439711","text":"Casio fx-115ES‚ÄîA modern scientific calculator from Casio with a dot matrix \\"Natural Textbook\\" LCD solar-powered scientific calculator from the 1980s using a single-line LCD A scientific calculator is a type of electronic calculator, usually but not always handheld, designed to calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics. They have completely replaced slide rules in traditional applications, and are widely used in both education and professional settings. In certain contexts such as higher education, scientific calculators have been superseded by graphing calculators, which offer a superset of scientific calculator functionality along with the ability to graph input data and write and store programs for the device. There is also some overlap with the financial calculator market.  Functions  Modern scientific calculators generally have many more features than a standard four or five-function calculator, and the feature set differs between manufacturers and models; however, the defining features of a scientific calculator include: * scientific notation * floating-point arithmetic * logarithmic functions, using both base 10 and base e * trigonometric functions (some including hyperbolic trigonometry) * exponential functions and roots beyond the square root * quick access to constants such as pi and e In addition, high-end scientific calculators generally include: * cursor controls to edit equations and view previous calculations * hexadecimal, binary, and octal calculations, including basic Boolean mathematics * complex numbers * fractions calculations * statistics and probability calculations * programmability ‚Äî see Programmable calculator * equation solving * matrix calculations * calculus * letters that can be used for spelling words or including variables into an equation * conversion of units * physical constants While most scientific models have traditionally used a single-line display similar to traditional pocket calculators, many of them have more digits (10 to 12), sometimes with extra digits for the floating-point exponent. A few have multi-line displays, with some models from Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments (both US manufacturers), Casio, Sharp, and Canon (all three Japanese makers) using dot matrix displays similar to those found on graphing calculators.  Uses  Scientific calculators are used widely in situations that require quick access to certain mathematical functions, especially those that were once looked up in mathematical tables, such as trigonometric functions or logarithms. They are also used for calculations of very large or very small numbers, as in some aspects of astronomy, physics, and chemistry. They are very often required for math classes from the junior high school level through college, and are generally either permitted or required on many standardized tests covering math and science subjects; as a result, many are sold into educational markets to cover this demand, and some high-end models include features making it easier to translate a problem on a textbook page into calculator input, e.g. by providing a method to enter an entire problem in as it is written on the page using simple formatting tools. History HP-35, the world's first scientific pocket calculator, was introduced in 1972 by Hewlett-Packard. It used reverse Polish notation and an LED display. TI SR-50 The first scientific calculator that included all of the basic ideas above was the programmable Hewlett-Packard HP-9100A,HP-9100A/B at hpmuseum.org released in 1968, though the Wang LOCI-2 and the Mathatronics Mathatron had some features later identified with scientific calculator designs. The HP-9100 series was built entirely from discrete transistor logic with no integrated circuits, and was one of the first uses of the CORDIC algorithm for trigonometric computation in a personal computing device, as well as the first calculator based on reverse Polish notation (RPN) entry. HP became closely identified with RPN calculators from then on, and even today some of their high-end calculators (particularly the long-lived HP-12C financial calculator and the HP-48 series of graphing calculators) still offer RPN as their default input mode due to having garnered a very large following. The HP-35, introduced on February 1, 1972, was Hewlett-Packard's first pocket calculator and the world's first handheld scientific calculator.HP-35 Scientific Calculator Awarded IEEE Milestone Like some of HP's desktop calculators it used RPN. Introduced at US$395, the HP-35 was available from 1972 to 1975. Texas Instruments (TI), after the production of several units with scientific notation, introduced a handheld scientific calculator on January 15, 1974, in the form of the SR-50.SR-50 page at datamath.org TI continues to be a major player in the calculator market, with their long-running TI-30 series being one of the most widely used scientific calculators in classrooms. Casio, Canon and Sharp have also been major players, with Casio's fx series (beginning with the Casio fx-1 in 1972Casio FX-1 Desktop Scientific Calculator) being a very common brand, used particularly in schools. Casio is also a major player in the graphing calculator market, and was the first company to produce one (Casio fx-7000G).

During his reign, Jin saw his dynasty survive a major attempt by Former Qin to destroy it, but he would nevertheless be the last Jin emperor to actually exercise imperial power, as his sons Emperor An and Emperor Gong would be controlled by regents and warlords. Emperor Xiaowu died an unusual death‚Äîhe was killed by his concubine Honoured Lady Zhang after he insulted her.  Early life  Sima Yao was born in 362, when his father Sima Yu was Prince of Kuaiji and prime minister for his grandnephew, Emperor Ai. Sima Yao's mother, Li Lingrong, was originally a servant involved in textile production but, based on a magician's words that she would bear his heir (his sons all having died early by that point), Sima Yu took her as his concubine and she gave birth to Sima Yao. As he was born at dawn, she named him Yao, with the courtesy name Changming, both meaning \\"dawn\\". A year later she gave birth to his brother, Sima Daozi. As the oldest surviving son of Sima Yu, Sima Yao was designated as the heir apparent early in his life, and in 365, when he was just three years old, Emperor Fei offered the greater title of Prince of Langya to his father and the title of Prince of Kuaiji to him. Sima Yu declined, both personally and on his son's behalf, and Emperor Fei did not insist on them taking on the greater titles. In 371, having lost a devastating battle to the Former Yan general Murong Chui in 369, the paramount general Huan Wen accused Emperor Fei of impotence and of not being the biological father of his sons. He then deposed him and made Sima Yu the new emperor (as Emperor Jianwen), although actual power was in Huan's hands. In 372, Emperor Jianwen grew ill and he named Sima Yao crown prince but in his will, he offered the throne to Huan, if he wanted it. When his official Wang Tanzhi () objected, Emperor Jianwen gave approval for an amendment, written by Wang, wherein Huan was only compared to the statesmen Zhuge Liang and Wang Dao. Nevertheless, when Emperor Jianwen died, many officials were apprehensive of Huan, and not immediately willing to declare Crown Prince Yao as the new emperor. Finally, at the instigation of Wang Biaozhi (), Crown Prince Yao took the throne as Emperor Xiaowu.  Early reign  The new emperor was only 10 years old, therefore his cousin, Empress Dowager Chu (Emperor Kang's wife), served as regent, but the decisions were actually being made by Xie An and Wang Tanzhi; Huan Wen, apparently fearful of being entrapped, declined an offer to be regent. In 373, Huan Wen died and the fears of a Huan usurpation dissipated as his brother and successor, Huan Chong, was committed to the survival of the imperial government. A major issue for the Jin government was the continued military pressure exerted by the powerful northern rival, Former Qin. In 373, Former Qin attacked and seized Jin's Liang (Ê¢ÅÂ∑û, modern southern Shaanxi) and Yi (ÁõäÂ∑û, modern Sichuan and Chongqing) provinces. Internally, however, Jin was apparently well-governed by Xie and Huan Chong. In 375, Emperor Xiaowu married Wang Fahui (the daughter of the official, Wang Yun () as his empress. He was 13 and she was 16. He also started studying the Chinese classic texts and writing poetry. In 376, Empress Dowager Chu officially removed herself from the regent position and returned her powers to Emperor Xiaowu, although the decisions were still largely being made by Xie. In 376, the Jin vassal, Former Liang, was attacked by Former Qin. Jin forces, under Huan Chong's command, attempted to relieve the pressure on Former Liang by attacking Former Qin, but Former Liang fell quickly and Huan Chong withdrew his forces. In apprehension of a Former Qin attack, Jin evacuated much of its population north of the Huai River to regions south of the river. In 378, Former Qin made major attacks against the important Jin cities of Xiangyang, Weixing (È≠èËàà, in modern Ankang, Shaanxi), and Pengcheng. While general Xie Xuan was able to immediately recapture Pengcheng after it fell, Xiangyang and Weixing were taken by Former Qin forces in 379. In 380, Empress Wang died. Emperor Xiaowu did not have another empress for the rest of his life. In 381, Emperor Xiaowu began to study Buddhist sutras and he established a Buddhist study hall inside his palace, inviting monks to live within. In 383, Huan Chong made a counterattack against Former Qin, hoping to recapture Xiangyang and the southwest. However, after initial losses, Huan abandoned the campaign.  The Battle of Fei River  Later in 383, Former Qin's emperor, Fu JiƒÅn, launched a major attack against Jin, intending to destroy it and unite China. At the Battle of Fei River, however, his forces panicked after trying to retreat to draw Jin forces across the river, and his army was routed with great losses, including his brother and prime minister, Fu Rong. Former Qin began to collapse after this defeat and never again posed a threat to Jin.  Middle reign  After defeating Former Qin forces, Xie Xuan spearheaded a campaign to regain lost territory, and Jin captured most of the Former Qin provinces south of the Yellow River, as well as regaining Liang and Yi provinces. However, Prime Minister Xie An, who was most credited with the victory, began to lose favor in Emperor Xiaowu's eyes; Xie's son-in-law, Wang Guobao (), unhappy that Xie did not give him important posts, began to flatter both Emperor Xiaowu and his brother, Sima Daozi, the Prince of Kuaiji, as a means of undercutting Xie. Xie remained prime minister, however, until his death in 385; he was replaced by Sima Daozi. Both Emperor Xiaowu and Sima became obsessed with feasting and drinking, and neither spent much time on affairs of state. In 387, Emperor Xiaowu named his oldest son, five-year-old Sima Dezong, crown prince, notwithstanding the fact that Sima was developmentally disabled‚Äîso severely that even after he grew older, he was described as not being able to talk, dress himself, or to tell whether he was full or hungry while eating. In 390, Emperor Xiaowu began to tire of how his brother, Sima Daozi, was taking his favors for granted, and he decided to look for counterbalancing forces. He made the officials Wang Gong (ÁéãÊÅ≠, Empress Wang's brother) and Yin Zhongkan () key regional governors, despite warnings that both Wang and Yin were talented but narrow-minded, and might create issues later.  Late reign  By 395, the conflict between Emperor Xiaowu and Sima had flared into the open, but because of the intercession of Empress Dowager Li, Emperor Xiaowu did not remove his brother. After further mediation by Xu Miao (), the relationship between the brothers seemed to be restored. By 396, Emperor Xiaowu was spending so much of his time on drinking and women that he was not tending to important matters of state. His favorite consort was the beautiful Honoured Lady Zhang. In late fall 396, when she was almost 30 years old, Emperor joked at a feast saying, \\"Based on your age, you should yield your position. I want someone younger.\\" That night, after Emperor Xiaowu fell drunk, she ordered all the eunuchs away, bribing them with wine, and then ordered her servant girls to suffocate Emperor Xiaowu by putting a blanket over his face. She further bribed the attendants and claimed that the emperor died suddenly in his sleep. The death was not investigated and the next day, Sima Dezong assumed the throne as Emperor An, with Sima Daozi as regent.

It was incorporated as a city in 2001. The total population is 984 according to the 2010 census. History Historic plaque in Jarrell Founded in 1909 by real estate developer O.D. Jarrell, along with E. C. Haeber, the town was settled at the intersection of an old stagecoach road and the Bartlett and Western Railway that was under construction. Soon after the railroad was completed, a saloon, two stores, a post office, and a bank were built. Because of the proximity of Jarrell to the railroad, the residents of nearby Corn Hill moved to the town. The city reached a population peak of 500 residents in 1914. The closing of the railway and the decline of the cotton industry, however, led to a long term recession. At one point, Jarrell had only 200 residents. After this low point, the city experienced a recovery that increased its population to 410 by 1990. Over 15 new businesses opened in Jarrell in 2009. On May 27, 1997, the town suffered heavily from the destructive F5 Jarrell Tornado, which obliterated the Double Creek Estates subdivision, killing 27 people plus 300 cattle and horses. Education Jarrell is served by the Jarrell Independent School District. The district currently has two elementary, one middle school and one high school. Between 2012 and 2019 student enrollment more than doubled. The district's middle school was built in 2014, but is undergoing an expansion in 2018‚Äì2019 to gain more classroom and science labs so that it can better accommodate the growing population of students. The high school is also being expanded including the addition of a performing arts center. The current superintendent for the district is Dr. Bill Chapman, who was named 2018 Superintendent of the Year for Region 13 of the Texas Education Agency. DemographicsGovernment The current Mayor of Jarrell is Larry Bush. City council meets on the 3rd Tuesday of each month at City Hall. Jarrell Emergency services are provided by the Jarrell Fire Department operating under Williamson County ESD#5, with Chief Mark McAdams. The City's chief of police is Roger Thompson. The Police department serves a growing population and maintains a very low crime rate. Climate The climate in the area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.

Of Baltic German origin, von Renteln studied law and economics in Berlin and Rostock, but became a journalist. In 1928, he joined the NSDAP and the following year, he became the founder and head of the National Socialist Schoolchildren's League (NSS). In 1931, he was appointed the head of the Hitler Youth, but he gave up leadership of the two organizations upon his election to the Reichstag in 1932. In 1932‚Äì1933 he led the Combat League of the Commercial Middle Class (NS- Kampfbund f√ºr den Gewerblichen Mittelstand), an organisation allegedly \\"Deflecting Jewish Atrocity and Boycott-Mongering\\", participating in the boycott of Jewish businesses and other forms of persecution. In June 1933, he was appointed President of the National Socialist Council of Industry and Trade (Nationalsozialistische Handwerks-, Handels-, und Gewerbeorganisation or NS-HAGO), holding this position until 1935, when this organisation was merged with the German Labor Front (DAF).Historisches Lexikon Bayerns Von Renteln became a staff leader of the German Labor Front. In 1940, he was appointed the Reich Leader of the Trade and Artisanship Section of the NSDAP (Hauptamtsleiter Handel und Handwerk in der Reichsleitung der NSDAP). He was also the head of the Supreme Court of the Reich Labor Front. In July 1941, he was appointed the Generalkommissar of Generalbezirk Litauen (roughly modern Lithuania), where he took harsh measures against the Jewish population. On August 26, 1941, he ordered that all telephones and lines were to be stripped, postal service be cut off, and bridges to the Kaunas (Kovno) Ghetto be surrounded with barbed wire fences to prevent people from jumping off. This order also forbade the Jews of the Kovno ghetto to use doors, window frames, or houses for fuel. In 1943, he was implicated in the clearing of the Vilna Ghetto, deporting 20,000 Jews to concentration or death camps, as well as in plundering. According to some accounts, after World War II, he was captured by the Russians, tried, and hanged for war crimes in 1946.

In 2011, Fidelity changed the name of its international division from Fidelity International to Fidelity Worldwide Investment and a new logo was introduced. In 2012, the company moved its Boston headquarters to 245 Summer Street. In 2014, Abigail Johnson became president and CEO of Fidelity Investments (FMR) and chairman of Fidelity International (FIL). In 2018, Fidelity launched a separate entity dedicated to institutional cryptoasset custody and cryptocurrency trading. In May 2019, it was reported that the firm would soon be offering cryptocurrency trading to institutional customers. In October 2019, the company launched Fidelity Digital Asset Services, which will handle cryptocurrency custody and trade execution for institutional investors. Fidelity's assets under management climbed 26% in 2019 to a record $3.2 trillion, which helped boost revenue to $20.9 billion and operating income to $6.9 billion. In March 2020, Fidelity opened a new investor center in Chesnut Hill, MA. Current operations=Mutual funds In the 1960s, Fidelity was the first major American finance firm to market mutual funds directly to everyday people via direct mail advertising and door to door sales.Peter Lynch and John Rothschild, Beating the Street Simon & Schuster; Revised edition (May 25, 1994) 0671891634 Previously, mutual funds had been marketed almost exclusively to high-income or high-wealth individuals, retirement funds for employers, and/or those already in the finance industry. FMR has three fund divisions: Equity (headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts), High-Income (headquartered in Boston) and Fixed-Income (headquartered in Merrimack, New Hampshire). The company's largest equity mutual fund is Fidelity Contrafund, which has $107.4 billion in assets, making it the largest non-indexed fund in the US and the largest fund managed by an individual. William Danoff has managed Contrafund since 1990. Fidelity Magellan is another large equity fund, with $15.5 billion in assets. Its current manager is Jeffrey Feingold, who also manages the Fidelity Trend Fund. It was previously managed by Ned Johnson from May 2, 1963, to Dec. 31, 1971, Peter Lynch from May 31, 1977, to May 31, 1990, and Harry W. Lange from 2005 to 2012. Under Lynch's leadership Magellan averaged 29% a year, more than doubling the growth rate of the benchmark S&P; 500, and remains the best-performing mutual funds in history over such an extended period.The Intelligent Investor, 2003, Commentary on the Introduction Brokerage Fidelity Investments operates a major brokerage firm and has investor centers in over 140 locations throughout the US.

Donor-advised fund  Fidelity manages a donor-advised fund, Fidelity Charitable, in 1991, becoming the first commercial DAF provider. As of 2017, Fidelity Charitable is currently the largest charity by donations from the public, surpassing the United Way. Tax donations to a DAF can be registered in the year of the donation, when the beneficiary may be being chosen. In a 2015 survey by Fidelity Charitable, 90% of donors who responded stated this benefit as the main reason for starting donations using a DAF. Donors also cite that this allows them to give more to charity. Investments in a DAF register interest until the distribution is given to a beneficiary. Fidelity Charitable produces a report \\"Women and Giving\\" that examines differences in giving attitudes, strategies and priorities across generations and gender.  Eight Roads  Fidelity International (FIL) also runs its own proprietary investing arm called Eight Roads. It is a global platform with 100+ investment professionals across China, Japan, India, Singapore and UK. In 2018, Eight Roads launched a new European fund. In June 2019, Fidelity announced it may demerge Eight Roads from its core business. Controversies= Insiders' private investments competing with their customers  A private venture capital firm, F-Prime Capital Partners, managed on behalf of owners and other key leaders of Fidelity Investments, has been described as directly competing with Fidelity Investments public funds. A 2016 Reuters investigation identified multiple cases where F-Prime Capital Partners was able to make investments at a fraction of the price of Fidelity Investments. Because of SEC regulations, investments by F-Prime Capital Partners preclude Fidelity from making the same early investments. The investigation describes that this competition forces Fidelity to delay investing until later and at much higher prices than F-Prime Capital Partners, resulting in lower returns for Fidelity fund shareholders. Corporate governance experts have stated that the practice is not illegal, but that it poses a clear corporate conflict of interest. Fidelity spokesmen have stated that they are following all laws and regulations.  Appearance of insiders propping up private investments  The same Reuters investigation documents six cases (out of 10) where Fidelity Investments became one of the largest investors of F-Prime Capital companies after the start-up companies became publicly traded. Legal and academic experts said that major investments by Fidelity mutual funds - with their market-moving buying power - could be seen as propping up the values of the F-Prime Capital investments, to the benefit of Fidelity insiders. Fidelity declined to comment on this aspect of the investigation. Legal issues=Document retention fines In February 2007, the NASD, a division of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fined 4 FMR-affiliated broker-dealers $3.75 million for alleged registration, supervision and e-mail retention violations. The broker-dealers settled without admitting or denying the charges. In 2004, Fidelity Brokerage paid $2 million to settle charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that employees altered and destroyed documents in 21 of its 88 branch offices between January 2001 and July 2002. Fidelity has internal inspections every year to make sure it is complying with federal regulations. Management was accused of pressuring branch employees to have perfect inspections and gave notice of the inspections and that at least 62 employees destroyed or altered potentially improper documents maintained at branch offices including new account applications, letters of authorization and variable annuity forms. Misrepresentations In May 2007, NASD fined two Fidelity broker-dealers $400,000 for preparing and distributing misleading sales literature promoting Fidelity's Destiny I and II Systematic Investment Plans, which were sold primarily to U.S. military personnel. As part of the settlement, the FMR affiliates were required to notify Destiny Plan holders who want to increase their investments in existing Destiny Plans that additional shares of the underlying fund can be purchased outside the Destiny Plans without paying the additional sales charges. Ownership and management Fidelity Investments Investor Center on Boylston Street in Boston Johnson Family The founding Johnson family, individually and through various trusts, owns stock representing a 49% voting interest in FMR, and have signed agreements pledging to vote all their shares as a bloc. Edward Johnson III was chairman of the group, but was replaced by his daughter, Abigail Johnson. Abigail was once the largest single shareholder with about 25% ownership, but in October 2005, it was reported that she had sold a \\"significant\\" portion of her shares to family trusts, and that there were doubts as to whether she was still in line to succeed her father. Employees and ex-employees Most of the remaining 51% of the company is held by various Fidelity employees and ex-employees, including fund managers and ex- managers, such as Peter Lynch.Fidelity Investments (March 18, 2013). \\"Activities and Management of FMR.

Specifically, he served under al-Ma'mun during the Fourth Fitna and led the armies that would defeat al-Amin, making al-Ma'mun the caliph. He was then rewarded as governor of Khorasan, which marked the beginning of the Tahirid dynasty.  Early life  Map of Khurasan and its surrounding regions Tahir was born in Pushang which was a village near the ancient city of Herat in Khorasan. He was from a dehqanSectarian and national movements in Iran, Khurasan and Transoxanial during Umayyad in early Abbasid times, F. Daftary, History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Vol. IV, 57. noble family who had distinguished themselves since the Abbasid Revolution, and were previously awarded minor governorships in eastern Khorasan for their service to the Abbasids.The Tahirids and Saffarids, C.E. Bosworth, The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 4, 91. His grandfather Ruzaiq was a mawla of Talha ibn Abd Allah al-Khuza'i, an Arab nobleman from the Khuza'a tribe, who served as the governor of Sistan. Ruzaiq's son Mus'ab was the governor of Pushang and Herat. Mus'ab's son, Husayn, who was the father of Tahir, continued to his father's role as the governor of Pushang and Herat. Under the governor of Khorasan, Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, there were riots in the province because of the latter's cruelty and persecution of other noble families, which included the family of Tahir; Tahir was imprisoned for some time and was mistreated. When he was released he fought on the side of Harthama ibn A'yan against Rafi ibn al-Layth in 808 when the latter rebelled at Samarkand, but when the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid deposed Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, and sent general Harthama ibn A'yan against Rafi, he returned to obedience. During the event, Tahir lost an eye after an accident, which gained him the nickname al-A'war (\\"the one-eyed\\"). Tahir seems to have been quickly offended if someone picked him about his eye, even threatening a poet, who had humiliated him about his lost eye in a poem. The caliph Harun al-Rashid later died in 809, and was succeeded by his son al-Amin.  Abbasid Civil War  Map of Iraq and surrounding regions in the early 9th-century In 810, the caliph al-Amin, and his brother, Al-Ma'mun, came in conflict which each others, which later led to a civil war; in January 811, al-Amin formally began the Great Abbasid Civil War when he appointed Ali ibn Isa as governor of Khurasan, placed him at the head of an unusually large army of 40,000, drawn from an elite group known as abna‚Ä≤, and sent him to depose al-Ma'mun. When Ali ibn Isa set out for Khurasan, he reportedly took along a set of silver chains with which to bind al-Ma'mun and carry him back to Baghdad.Kennedy (2004), p. 148Rekaya (1991), pp. 332‚Äì333 The news of Ali's approach threw Khurasan into panic, and even al-Ma'mun considered fleeing. The only military force available to him was a small army of some 4,000‚Äì5,000 men, under Tahir. Tahir was sent to confront Ali's advance, but it was widely regarded as almost a suicide mission, even by Tahir's own father. The two armies met at Rayy, on the western borders of Khurasan, and the ensuing battle (3 July 811) resulted in a crushing victory for the Khurasanis, in which Ali was killed and his army disintegrated on its flight west.El-Hibri (2011), p. 285Rekaya (1991), p. 333 Tahir's unexpected victory was decisive: al-Ma'mun's position was secured, while his main opponents, the abna‚Ä≤, lost men, prestige and their most dynamic leader.Kennedy (2004), p. 149 Tahir now advanced westwards, defeated another abna‚Ä≤ army of 20,000 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala after a series of hard- fought engagements near Hamadan, and reached Hulwan by winter.Daniel (1979), pp. 179‚Äì180 Al-Amin now desperately tried to bolster his forces by alliances with Arab tribes, notably the Banu Shayban of Jazira and the Banu Qays of Syria. The veteran Abd al-Malik ibn Salih was sent to Syria to mobilize its troops along with Ali ibn Isa's son, Husayn. However, al-Amin's efforts failed due to the long-standing intertribal divisions between Qaysis and Kalbis, the Syrians' reluctance to get involved in the civil war, as well as the unwillingness of the abna‚Ä≤ to cooperate with the Arab tribes and to make political concessions to them. These failed efforts to secure Arab support backfired on al-Amin, as the abna‚Ä≤ began to doubt whether their interests were best served by him. In March 812, Husayn ibn Ali led a short-lived coup against al-Amin in Baghdad, proclaiming al-Ma'mun as the rightful Caliph, until a counter-coup, led by other factions within the abna‚Ä≤, restored al-Amin to the throne. Fadl ibn al-Rabi, however, one of the main instigators of the war, concluded that al-Amin's case was lost and resigned from his court offices. At about the same time, al-Ma'mun was officially proclaimed caliph, while his vizier Fadl ibn Sahl acquired the unique title of Dhu 'l-Ri'asatayn (\\"he of the two headships\\"), signifying his control over both civil and military administration. In spring 812, Tahir, reinforced with more troops under Harthama ibn A'yan, resumed his offensive. He invaded Khuzistan, where he defeated and killed the Muhallabid governor Muhammad ibn Yazid, whereupon the Muhallabids of Basra surrendered to him. Tahir also took Kufa and al- Mada'in, advancing on Baghdad from the west while Harthama closed in from the east. At the same time, al-Amin's authority crumbled as supporters of al- Ma'mun took control of Mosul, Egypt and the Hejaz, while most of Syria, Armenia and Azerbaijan fell under the control of the local Arab tribal leaders.Rekaya (1991), p. 334 As Tahir's army closed on Baghdad, the rift between al-Amin and the abna‚Ä≤ was solidified when the desperate Caliph turned to the common people of the city for help and gave them arms. The abna‚Ä≤ began deserting to Tahir in droves, and in August 812, when Tahir's army appeared before the city, he established his quarters in the suburb of Harbiyya, traditionally an abna‚Ä≤ stronghold. Map showing the domains of the Tahirid dynasty The Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy characterized the subsequent siege of the city as \\"an episode almost without parallel in the history of early Islamic society\\" and \\"the nearest early Islamic history saw to an attempt at social revolution\\", as Baghdad's urban proletariat defended their city for over a year in a vicious urban guerrilla war.Kennedy (2004), pp. 149‚Äì150Rekaya (1991), pp. 333‚Äì334 Indeed, it was this \\"revolutionary\\" situation in the city as much as famine and the besiegers' professional expertise, that brought about its fall: in September 813, Tahir convinced some of the richer citizens to cut the pontoon bridges over the Tigris that connected the city to the outside world, allowing al-Ma'mun's men to occupy the city's eastern suburbs. Tahir then launched a final assault, in which al-Amin was captured and executed at Tahir's orders while trying to seek refuge with his old family friend Harthama.Kennedy (2004), p. 150  Governor of Khorasan and death  Tahir was afterwards transferred out of the public eye to an unimportant post in Raqqa. However, he was later recalled from the post, and was rewarded with the governorship of Khorasan. Tahir then began consolidating his authority over the region, appointing several officials to certain offices, including Muhammad ibn Husayn Qusi, who was appointed as the governor of Sistan. Tahir later declared independence from the Abbasid empire in 822 by omitting any mention of al-Ma'mun during a Friday sermon. However, he died the same night. According to some sources, he was poisoned by the orders of al-Ma'mun. Nevertheless, al-Ma'mun appointed Tahir's son to continue at his father's post. Tahir is said to have said his last words in Persian, his native language.

The first mutual fund, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund, is still in operation today. MFS had $528.4 billion in assets under management as of January 31, 2020.  History  The company was founded in 1924 by Learoyd and Ashton L. Carr.\\"85 Innovations 1917-1983\\", December 23, 2002, Forbes.com, Retrieved June 2011 The company's oldest fund is the Massachusetts Investors Trust, a mutual fund created with $50,000 at the company's inception and reported to be \\"the world's first open-end investment fund\\". The company used \\"brokerage channels\\" to market its shares to the public and later expanded to $14 million in assets over the next five years. During the stock market crash of 1929 the fund survived an 83% loss and went on to create a second fund in 1934. By 1959, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund had become the largest mutual fund in the United States. In 1969, MIT was reorganized as Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS) to reflect the firm's broadened scope of products and services. In 1976, MFS offered one of the nation‚Äôs first national municipal bond funds (Managed Municipal Bond Trust) and in 1981, MFS launched the country‚Äôs first globally diversified fixed-income fund (Massachusetts Financial International Trust-Bond Portfolio). In 1986, MFS offered the first closed-end, high-yield municipal bond fund to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1982, the company was acquired by Sun Life Financial of Canada. In 1998, MFS Chairman and Chief Executive, A. Keith Brodkin died, causing a major shift in top management. MFS's assets under management grew from $55 billion to $90 billion between 1997 and 1998, and was reported to be the fastest growing company amongst the twenty largest that funds sold through brokers.Amey Stone, \\"MFS MIT: A Fund That Epitomizes Long-Term Investing\\", Bloomberg, August 13, 1998, Retrieved July 19, 2011. During the early 2000s, MFS and five other mutual fund companies in the Boston area were investigated by Massachusetts and New Hampshire regulators. That same year, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that MFS made \\"false and misleading\\" statements in its fund prospectus about its policy on market trading and market timing. MFS paid $350 million to settle state and federal fraud charges. MFS appointed Robert Pozen as non- executive chairman from 2004 to 2010.Andrew Caffrey and Jeffrey Krasner, \\"Mass., N.H. broaden probe\\", Boston Globe, November 19, 2003, Retrieved July 19, 2011. MFS then implemented a set of company reforms to inform investors about fees, keep fund boards independent and create deterrents to market timing. These changes were intended to address the concerns of regulators and lawmakers and were praised by fund industry analysts and consumer advocates. These reforms ended the \\"soft-dollar\\" arrangements which allowed the swapping of brokerage commissions for market research and data. From 2010 to 2020, assets under management grew from $253 billion to $528.4 billion.Headquarters of MFS  See also  * List of mutual-fund families * Mutual fund  References  External links  *Company web site Category:Financial services companies established in 1924 Category:Companies based in Boston Category:Investment management companies of the United States Category:Mutual funds of the United States Category:Privately held companies based in Massachusetts ","title":"MFS Investment Management"},{"id":"439750","text":"QW may refer to: * QWERTY keyboard layout * IATA code for Qingdao Airlines * Former IATA code for Blue Wings * QuakeWorld, a video game *QueerWeek, a newspaper publication * Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, a video game * Quantum well, in quantum physics and materials science * an operator of the Perl programming language ","title":"QW"},{"id":"439764","text":"Christ Gospel Church is a fundamentalist, Pentecostal Christian denomination. It was founded in the 1950s by Berniece R. Hicks and fellow believers starting in a small Christian mission in Louisville, Kentucky. Doctrines The Christ Gospel Churches affirm their acceptance of the Apostles' Creed as an expression of Christian faith. Their Pentecostal emphasis is seen in teaching the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the evidence of glossolalia, or speaking in tongues (Acts 2:4,11,38).¬π However, they do not believe that evidence of glossolalia is a requirement for salvation; rather, it is a gift that Christians can accept as they desire. The church also teaches that water baptism by immersion is a commandment for all Christians (Acts 2:38; 8:12; 9:5,18).¬π The church believes that worship should embrace all kinds of music (e.g., traditional hymns, choruses, country gospel, urban gospel, classical) and musical instruments (e.g., drums, guitars, pianos, saxophones, trumpets, violins). The church welcomes all races and classes of people because it realizes the importance of people being united in Christ rather than being divided among themselves. The church teaches \\"old-fashioned Holiness\\" in matters of conduct and dress, but also understands there are different levels of commitment and regards this as a matter of the individual conscience.¬π The emphasis of Hicks' teachings is that the Bible is the infallible Word of God and that it calls on Christians to grow to spiritual maturity, both in their moral development and in their spiritual love relationship with Jesus Christ, in order to be in the Bride of Christ. The core of her distinctive approach to Scripture is founded on the principle that the Old Testament Tabernacle was laid out in the form of a cross and serves as a picture or metaphor of Christian believers' spiritual experiences as they grow to maturity in Christ Jesus, as taught in the New Testament (Hebrews 9:8-11; Ephesians 2:19-22).http://christgospel.org/about-us.html A related core principle is that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Head over all things and that all things work together for good to those who love the Lord. These concepts can be found throughout Hicks's numerous publications and in church teachings. Some of her beliefs are profound. For example, the description of her book The Four Eternities explains her view that \\"God established His four Eternities for specific purposes. By studying the four Hebrew words: keh-dem, o-lawm, ad, and nay-tsakh‚Äìnaw-tsakh, we find out what these purposes are. Before all other Eternal Wheels of God‚Äôs Name were put in motion, the LORD curved, formed, and put the Eternal Wheel of His Purposive Will into permanent, perpetual motion. Every Eternal Wheel of God‚Äôs Name revolves to reveal Himself to His Creation.\\" International Outreach Mission Outreach, spreading the Word of God throughout the world, is an important part of Christ Gospel Churches ministry. Over 1500 churches world-wide are affiliated with Christ Gospel Churches International Inc (CGCII). Each country's Christ Gospel affiliated organization is an independent legal entity run by local church leaders.

It was one of the most highly anticipated fights of the early 1980s. Setup Larry Holmes had been the WBC heavyweight champion since 1978, when he beat Ken Norton by a fifteen-round split decision at the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Over the course of his illustrious career, on the way to almost tying the great Rocky Marciano's record of 49-0, losing in the 49th fight, a decision to the \\"Jinx\\" Michael Spinks, fought such fighters as Ossie Ocasio, Mike Weaver, Trevor Berbick, Leon Spinks and, most notably, Muhammad Ali. Gerry Cooney, on the other hand, had been a professional fighter since 1977, and he was able to beat boxers such as Jimmy Young and others. The turning point of his career came when he beat Ken Norton, in May 1981, by knockout in round one at the Madison Square Garden in New York. Anticipation over a Holmes-Cooney confrontation began to take shape in early 1981, but the fight took over a year to happen, partly because 1981 in particular was a very busy year for boxing with many other big fights, partly because Holmes was obliged to defend against Berbick, Spinks and Renaldo Snipes in that order. Cooney only had one fight in 1981, against Norton. Holmes-Cooney was originally scheduled for March 1982, but was postponed until June when Cooney injured his back in training. By 1982, promoter Don King and manager Dennis Rappaport began one of the most massive and racially toned campaigns in boxing history to raise public interest for a fight between Holmes and Cooney. After they were both signed to fight, an intense promotional tour followed. Holmes and Cooney attended press conferences at several United States cities, Cooney was shown on the cover of Time magazine, Hollywood stars took an interest in the fight (Sylvester Stallone in particular hung out with Gerry Cooney, others, such as Woody Allen, attended the fight live) and Cooney was cast as \\"The Great White Hope\\". There had not been a White world Heavyweight champion in 22 years, and Cooney would try to change that. White supremacist groups had announced they would have \\"agents\\" ready to shoot at Holmes the moment he entered the ring, and Black groups retaliated by answering that they would also have armed people on hand in case Holmes was attacked. Because of this, there were police snipers on the roofs of every major hotel surrounding the fight's venue, once again, the Caesars Palace hotel and casino. Snipers were used because the fight was held at the hotel's parking lot; any attacker could have been easily shot by police snipers. The fight was televised live on closed-circuit and pay-per-view television all over the world. A week after the bout, it was re-broadcast on HBO, and later still, on ABC-TV. The fight Wilfredo G√≥mez knocked out Juan Antonio Lopez in ten rounds to retain his WBC super bantamweight title in the semi-final fight, and Holmes and Cooney then took center stage without any incidents. Holmes versus Cooney was refereed by Mills Lane. The announcer that night named Holmes first. Some thought that this was unprecedented; it is tradition in boxing that the challenger be named first and the champion last. The announcement was considered shameful and intensely disrespectful toward the champion Holmes by the boxing community. In fact, when Holmes had challenged Norton for the title, Norton had been introduced first. Nevertheless, when the boxers touched gloves before the first round began, Holmes told Cooney, \\"Let's have a good fight.\\" Holmes dropped Cooney in round two, but Cooney got up and landed a damage-causing shot to the body by the end of round four. Holmes and Cooney fought closely from rounds five to eight, trading punches in mid-ring. This was the point where Cooney's inactivity started affecting him, however, and Holmes again dropped the championship hopeful in round thirteen, which proved to be the final round. By round ten, Cooney's punches began landing low, and this caused him to fall further behind on the judges' scorecards, referee Lane deducting three points from him for the infractions. By round thirteen, Cooney seemed to believe that he would lose the fight and was just trying to last the fifteen round distance.Boxing 101, \\"Gerry Cooney, Still A Gentleman 30 Years Later: Part One - The Championship Fight\\", April 30, 2012 He had suffered a cut on his left eye and was taking heavy punishment. Midway through the round, a Holmes cross landed flush on Cooney's left cheek, and Cooney's legs buckled. He landed against the ropes, near his corner, and Holmes moved in, intent on finishing his job. Cooney's trainer, Victor Valle, prevented him from doing so, however, by throwing a towel from Cooney's corner, signifying that they were quitting. Aftermath Cooney had a series of problems after this fight, and he fought sporadically until 1990, when he retired for good after being knocked out in two rounds by George Foreman. Holmes, on the other hand, was Heavyweight champion until he lost his belt to Michael Spinks in 1985. He retired in 1986, but has made several comebacks since. HBO presented a documentary on the fight as part of its Legendary Nights series on memorable boxing bouts. Holmes and Cooney are now very good friendsBoxing 101, \\"Larry Holmes and Gerry Cooney: Foes for a Night, Friends for a Lifetime\\" , June 11, 2012 and Holmes has helped Cooney with Cooney's organization, F.I.S.T., which helps former boxers get other jobs and medical insurance after they retire.

Francescon was among the early founders of the Italian-American Pentecostal church in Chicago. He had left the First Italian Presbyterian Church of Chicago because of his belief in Water Baptism by immersion. Later, he accepted the doctrines of anointing with oil, miracles, and Holy Spirit baptism at the North Avenue Full Gospel Mission led by William Howard Durham. Evangelists from Chicago went to the Italian colonies in the United States planting churches mostly in the Northeast. Most of those churches were incorporated into the Christian Church of North America, with a few affiliated with the Christian Congregation in the United States. Doctrine Cover of Hymnal 3, in force from 1951 to 1965 There is an architectural and color standardization of the temples for easy identification of its members The beliefs of the Christian Congregation are set forth in their 12-articles of Faith. They believe in the Trinity, and in the Bible, salvation by faith in Jesus Christ. They accept the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and divine healing and miracles. The church holds two ordinances - water baptism by immersion and the Lord's supper. Congregational worship is held at chapels. Hymn singing is accompanied by a brass/silver band or orchestra. While in worship, women wear white veils, dresses and skirts. Men often dress in suit outfits. The inscription \\"In the Name of the Lord Jesus\\" is displayed and a baptismal font at the front of the chapel. Points of doctrine and of the faith which was once given to the saints # We believe and accept the entire Holy Bible as the infallible Word of God, inspired by the Holy Spirit; it is the only perfect order of our faith and manner of living, to which nothing can be added or taken away, and which is the power of God unto salvation to every believer. (II Peter 1:21; II Timothy 3:16,17; Romans 1:16) # We believe there is only one living and true God, eternal, with infinite power, Creator of all things; and in the unity of Him there are three distinct Persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. (Ephesians 4:6; Matthew 28:19, I John 5:7) # We believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the Word made flesh, who assumed the human nature through the virgin Mary and, so, is true God and true Man, having two natures in one Person, the divine and the human; and therefore is the only Saviour, who suffered death for the guilt of all men. (Luke 1:27-35; John 1:14; I Peter 3:18) # We believe in the personal existence of the devil and his angels, evil spirits that together with him will be punished in everlasting fire. (Matthew 25:41) # We believe that the regeneration, or the new birth, is received only through faith in Christ Jesus who was delivered up for our offenses and was raised again for our justification. They who are in Christ Jesus (cleansed through His blood), are new creatures, and have Him for wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption. (Romans 3:24,25; I Corinthians 1:30, II Corinthians 5:17) # We believe in water baptism, performed in the Name of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38), with a single immersion, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, according to Christ's commission. (Matthew 28:18-19) # We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit gives utterance. (Acts 2:4, 10:45-47; 19:6) # We believe in commemorating the Lord's Supper. The Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. \\"likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you. (Luke 22:19-20; I Corinthians 11:23-25) # We believe it is necessary to abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled and from fornication, as decreed by the Holy Spirit in the general assembly held in Jerusalem. (Acts 15:28-29, 16:4; 21:25) # We believe that Jesus Christ, took upon Himself, our sicknesses. Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church. and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the Name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. (Matthew 8:17, James 5:14-15) # We believe that the Lord, Himself, (before the millennium) shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord. (I Thessalonians 4:16- 17; Revelation 20:6) # We believe that there shall be a bodily resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.

Amateur career Sexson was born in Portland, Oregon. At Prairie High School in Brush Prairie, Washington, Sexson was an All-State performer in baseball, basketball, and football. He also set the school record for the most RBI and home runs in a career. Professional career=Cleveland Indians Sexson was drafted in 1993 by the Cleveland Indians in the 24th round (671st overall) of the baseball amateur draft. He reached the major leagues with five games in 1997. Sexson had a breakout year in 1999 with 31 home runs, and 116 runs batted in in 134 games. Milwaukee Brewers In 2000, Sexson was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers with a player to be named later, for Bob Wickman, Steve Woodard, and Jason Bere. In 2001, his 45 home runs tied the Brewers record set by Gorman Thomas in 1979. His 178 strikeouts also broke the Brewers record, but this was surpassed the following season by Jos√© Hern√°ndez. In 2002, Sexson represented the Milwaukee Brewers in the MLB All-Star Game which was played in Milwaukee. In 2003, he played in all 162 games and again tied the Brewers record of 45 home runs while hitting .272 and earning a selection to the 2003 MLB All-Star Game. Prince Fielder broke Sexson's and Thomas's team record in 2007, hitting 50 home runs. Sexson was the first of three players in Brewers history to have 100 or more RBIs in three consecutive seasons along with Fielder in 2007‚Äì2009 and Ryan Braun in 2008‚Äì10. Arizona Diamondbacks Sexson was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks in December 2003 along with pitcher Shane Nance and a player to be named later (Noochie Varner) for infielders Junior Spivey, Craig Counsell, Lyle Overbay, catcher Chad Moeller, and pitchers Chris Capuano and Jorge de la Rosa. This trade proved to be disastrous for the Diamondbacks, as Sexson missed most of the 2004 season after twice suffering a reverse subluxation of his left shoulder while attempting to check his swing. Seattle Mariners Richie Sexson at bat, May 2005. Prior to the 2005 season, Sexson signed a four-year contract with the Seattle Mariners worth $50 million. Sexson played well in the 2005 season, hitting 39 home runs and 121 RBI and put up similar numbers the following year, hitting 34 home runs and 107 RBI. However, Sexson struggled mightily in the 2007 season, batting .205 with 21 home runs and 63 RBIs, and again in the 2008 season, hitting just .218 with 11 home runs and 30 RBIs for Seattle. On May 8, 2008, in a game against the Texas Rangers, Sexson charged the mound towards Rangers starting pitcher Kason Gabbard and threw his batting helmet at him after Gabbard threw a head-high pitch over the middle of the plate, to which Sexson reacted as if it had hit him. Sexson later stated he was frustrated and had a lot going on in his head, including his son being in the hospital and his club's recent struggles. He was suspended six games for the incident. He later appealed the suspension, and it was dropped to five games. On July 10, 2008, Sexson was released by the Mariners. New York Yankees On July 18, 2008, Sexson signed with the New York Yankees. Sexson did well in his Yankee debut, by collecting his first hit as a Yankee in the first inning with a single and also bringing in Bobby Abreu for the first run that inning. He went 1‚Äì3 with one RBI, one walk, and one strikeout. His only home run (a grand slam) as a New York Yankee came on August 5, 2008, against the Texas Rangers. Sexson was designated for assignment on August 15, 2008, after batting .250 with one home run in 22 games for New York. He was released on August 24, 2008.

It is the fifth-most-populous city in Iran. In the Quru River valley in Iran's historic Azerbaijan region between long ridges of volcanic cones in the Sahand and Eynali mountains, Tabriz's elevation ranges between above sea level. The valley opens up into a plain that gently slopes down to the eastern shores of Lake Urmia, to the west. With cold winters and temperate summers, Tabriz is considered a summer resort. It was named World Carpet Weaving City by the World Crafts Council in October 2015 and Exemplary Tourist City of 2018 by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. With a population of over 1.7 million (2016), Tabriz is the largest economic hub and metropolitan area in Northwest Iran. The population is overwhelmingly Azerbaijani, though Persian is spoken by residents as a second language. Tabriz is a major heavy industries hub for automobiles, machine tools, refineries, petrochemicals, textiles and cement production industries. The city is famous for its handicrafts, including hand-woven rugs and jewellery. Local confectionery, chocolate, dried nuts and traditional Tabrizi food are recognised throughout Iran as some of the best. Tabriz is also an academic hub and a site for some of the most prestigious cultural institutes in Northwest Iran. Tabriz contains many historical monuments, representing Iran's architectural transition throughout its deep history. Most of Tabriz's preserved historical sites belong to Ilkhanid, Safavid and Qajar. Among these sites is the grand Bazaar of Tabriz, which is designated a World Heritage Site. From the early modern era, Tabriz was pivotal in the development, movement and economy of its three neighboring regions; namely the Caucasus, Eastern Anatolia and Central Iran. In modern era city played a vital role in the history of Iran. As the country's closest hub to Europe, many aspects of early modernisation in Iran began in Tabriz. Prior to forced ceding of the Qajar dynasty's Caucasian territories to Imperial Russia, following two Russo-Persian Wars in the first half of the 19th century, Tabriz was at the forefront of Iranian rule over its Caucasian territories. Until 1925, the city was the traditional residence of the Qajar crown princes.  Etymology  According to some sources,Gholam-Reza Sabri-Tabrizi. Iran: A Child's Story, a Man's Experience, International Publishers Co., 1989, p. 72, including Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, the name Tabriz derives from tap-riz, from the many thermal springs in the area. Other sources\\"Tabrƒ´z.\\" Microsoft Encarta 2007 [DVD]. Redmond: Microsoft Corporation, 2006.Samuel Graham Wilson. Persian Life and Customs, Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier, 1896, p.323 claim that in AD 246, to avenge his brother's death, king Tiridates II of Armenia repelled Ardashir I of the Sassanid Empire and changed the name of the city from Shahistan to Tauris, deriving from \\"ta-vrezh\\" (\\"this revenge\\" in Grabar). In AD 297, it became the capital of Tiridates III, king of Armenia. However, this story has a popular origin and no ancient source has recorded such event. This is based on accounts of Vardan Areveltsi, a 13th- century Armenian historian.V. Minorsky-[C.E. Bosworth], Blair, Sheila S. (2009) \\"Tabriz\\" Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition. Brill. The Cambridge History of Iran points to a connection between the \\"ancient stronghold of Tarui-Tarmakisa\\" (or Tarwi-Tarwakisa), which existed in VIII century BC, and the city of Tabriz, with Ernst Emil Herzfeld's Archaeological History of Iran also directly equating \\"Tarwakisa\\" with Tabriz. Thus, some researchers believe that Tabriz may be considered a pre-Iranian toponym.  History =Early history The early history of Tabriz is not well-documented. The earliest civilization signs in the city belongs to an Iron Age grave yard of 1st millennium B.C. which were unearthed in late 1990s in northern side of Blue Mosque. The city also inscribed as old as 714 B.C. on as Tarui or Tauris, on the Assyrian King Sargon II's epigraph in 714 BC. Egyptologist David Rohl suggested that the legendary Garden of Eden was near Tabriz. Archaeologist Eric H. Cline commented on Rohl's views, writing that \\"his suggestions have not caught on with the scholarly establishment. His argument is not helped by the fact that it depends upon speculations regarding the transmission of place-names for both the various rivers and nearby related areas from antiquity to the present. In the end, while Rohl‚Äôs suggestion is not out of the question, it seems no more probable than any other hypothesis, and less likely than those suggested by Speiser, Zarins, and Sauer.\\" Since the earliest documented history of Tabriz, it has been chosen as the capital for several rulers commencing from Atropates era and his dynasty. It is likely the city has been destroyed multiple times either by natural disasters or by the invading armies. The earliest elements of the present Tabriz are claimed to be built either at the time of the early Sassanids in the 3rd or 4th century AD, or later in the 7th century. The city used to be called T'awrƒì≈° in Middle Persian.  From the Arab conquest to the Constitutional Revolution  16th- century schematic map of Tabriz by Matrak√ßƒ± Nasuh After the Muslim conquest of Iran, the Arabian Azd tribe from Yemen resided in Tabriz. The development of post-Islamic Tabriz began as of this time. The Islamic geographer Yaqut al- Hamawi says that Tabriz was a village before Rawwad from the tribe of Azd arrive at Tabriz. In 791 AD, Zubaidah, the wife of Abbasid caliph Harun al- Rashid, rebuilt Tabriz after a devastating earthquake and beautified the city so much as to obtain the credit for having been its founder. In the ramadan of 1208, Tabriz, as well as its adjacent cities and territories were conquered by the Kingdom of Georgia under Tamar the Great, as a response to the massacre of 12,000 Christians in the Georgian-controlled city of Ani on Easter day by Muslims. In nearby Ardebil, conquered by the Georgians as well, as many as 12,000 Muslims were killed. The Georgians then pushed further, taking Khoy and Qazvin along the way. After the Mongol invasion, Tabriz came to eclipse Maragheh as the later Ilkhanid Mongol capital of Azerbaijan until it was sacked by Timur in 1392. Chosen as a capital by Abaqa Khan, fourth ruler of the Ilkhanate, for its favored location in the northwestern grasslands,David Morgan, The Mongols p. 142 in 1295, his successor Ghazan Khan made it the chief administrative centre of an empire stretching from Anatolia to the Oxus River and from the Caucasus to the Indian Ocean. Under his rule, new walls were built around the city, and numerous public buildings, educational facilities, and caravansarais were erected to serve traders travelling on the ancient Silk Road. The Byzantine Gregory Choniades is said to have served as the city's Orthodox bishop during this time. In the 13th century, many western expediters who visit Tabriz on their way to the east were amazed by the richness of the city, its magnificent buildings and its institutions.Will Durant, The Reformation: The Story of Civilization, Volume VI, Chapter XXX. Marco Polo, who travelled through the Silk Road and passed Tabriz about 1275, described it as: \\"a great city surrounded by beautiful and pleasant gardens. It is excellently situated so the goods brought to here coming from many regions. Latin merchants specially Genevis go there to buy the goods that come from foreign lands.\\" From 1375 to 1468, Tabriz was the capital of Qara Qoyunlu state in Azerbaijan,V. Minorsky. \\"JihƒÅn-ShƒÅh Qara-Qoyunlu and His Poetry (Turkmenica, 9)\\", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 16, No. 2 (1954), p. 277 until defeat of Qara Qoyunlu ruler, Jahan Shah by Ag Qoyunlu warriors. Ag Qoyunlus selected Tabriz as their capital from 1469 to 1501. Some of the existing historical monuments including the Blue Mosque belong to the Qara Qoyunlu period. In 1501, Shah Ismail I entered Tabriz and proclaimed it the capital of his Safavid state. In 1514, after the Battle of Chaldiran, Tabriz was temporarily occupied by the Ottomans. Tabriz was retaken by Iranian forces and it remained the capital of Safavid Iranian empire until 1548. In that year Shah Tahmasp I transferred it to Qazvin to avoid the growing threat of the Ottoman army to his capital. Between 1585 and 1603, Tabriz was under occupation by Ottomans. After it was retaken by the Safavids under Abbas I of Persia, the city grew as a major commerce centre, conducting trade with the Ottoman Empire, Russia, and the Caucasus. Tabriz was occupied and sacked by Ottoman Murad IV in 1635, during the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1623‚Äì39), before being returned to Persia in the Treaty of Zohab in 1639. In summer of 1721, a large earthquake shocked Tabriz, killing about eighty thousand of its residents. The devastation continued in 1724‚Äì1725, when the city was invaded by an Ottoman army. During this round of invasion, the Ottomans imprisoned many in Tabriz and killed about two hundred thousand residents.Tadeusz Jan Krusi≈Ñski, Du Cerceau (Jean-Antoine, p√®re), The history of the revolution of Persia, Volume 1, Edition of Father du Cerceau, London 1728 The city was subsequently retaken by the Iranian army, after which a widespread famine, combined with the spread of fatal diseases, killed more of those who still remained. In 1780, a major earthquake hit near Tabriz and killed as many as two hundred thousand people, leaving only about thirty thousand survivors. At the end of the 18th century, the city was divided into several districts, each of which was ruled by a family, until 1799, when the Qajar Prince Abbas Mirza was appointed as the governor of the city.Mo≈°e ≈†ƒÅr√¥n, Studies in Islamic History and Civilization: In Honour of Professor David Ayalon, Jerusalem 1986. During the Qajar dynasty the city was the residence for the Crown Prince. The crown prince normally served as governor of Azerbaijan province as well. Some of the most important events in this period were the wars between Qajar Iran and neighbouring Imperial Russia. Prior to the forced cession of Iran's Caucasian territories‚Äîcomprising what is now Georgia, southern Dagestan, Azerbaijan, and Armenia‚Äîto Imperial Russia following the two Russo-Persian Wars of the first half of the 19th century, Tabriz, being strategically located, was instrumental to the implementation of Iranian rule in its Caucasian territories. During the last Russo-Persian War, the Russo-Persian War of 1826‚Äì1828, the city was captured for Russia in 182 by General Prince Eristov, who marched into the city with 3,000 soldiers.First Encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913‚Äì1936 BRILL, 1993 p. 591 After Abbas Mirza and Ivan Paskevich signed the peace treaty, which granted for the irrevocable cession of the last remaining Caucasian territories, the Russian army retreated from the city. Nevertheless, Russian political and military influence remained a major force in Tabriz and north-northwestern Iran even until the fall of the Russian empire in the early 20th century. After the retreat of the Russian army, Abbas Mirza, the Qajar Crown Prince, launched a modernization scheme from Tabriz, during which he introduced Western-style institutions, imported industrial machinery, installed the first regular postal service, and undertook military reforms in the city. He also began a rebuilding campaign and established a modern taxation system. File:Tabriz by Eug√®ne Flandin.jpgSaheb-ol-Amr Mosque and Quru river, Eug√®ne Flandin 1841.

Contemporary era  Thanks to the geographical closeness to the West and to communications with nearby countries' enlightenment movements, Tabriz became the centre of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution movements between 1905 and 1911, which led to the establishment of a parliament in Iran and the formation of a constitution. Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan, two Tabrizi reformists who led Tabriz people's solidarity against the absolute monarchy, had a great role in achievement to the goals of Iran's constitutional revolution. In 1909, Tabriz was occupied by the Russian forces. Four months after the constitutional revolution's success, in December 1911, the Russians reinvaded Tabriz. After crushing the local resistance by invading Russian troops, they started suppressing the constitutional revolutionaries and residents of the city. Following the invasion, Russian troops executed about 1,200 of Tabriz residents. As a result of the campaign, Tabriz was occupied by the Russian forces between 1911 and 1917.

From the very start of World War I, Iran declared neutrality. When the war erupted on a full scale, Tabriz and much of northwestern-northern Iran had already been de facto occupied by Russia for several years. In later years of World War I, the Ottoman troops intervened and took control of the city by defeating the Russian troops stationed there. By this time, the Ottoman army led by Enver Pasha threatened the whole Russian army in the Caucasus region. Russian troops recaptured the city from the Ottomans at a later stage of the war. By escalation of the revolution in Russia, the Russian armies in Iranian Azerbaijan were evacuated, and the actual power passed into the hands of the local committee of the democrat party, with Ismail Nawbari at its head. Following Russia's retreat, the Ottomans captured the city once again for a few months until the decisive end of the war, and retreated thereafter. After World War I, a new era in the county's history began. Reza Shah, brigadier- general of the Persian Cossack Brigade, declared himself the king of the country following a coup d'√©tat. He started with promises of modernization programs in Iran which was concentrated on the unification of the country, under the idea of one country, one nation. This included centralization of the power and imposing restrictions on the local culture, heritage, and language in Iranian Azerbaijan, and the city of Tabriz.T. Atabaki, Azerbaijan: Ethnicity and the Struggle for Power in Iran, I.B Tauris, 2000, p. 53. The modernization and nationalization plan of Reza Shah continued until the surge of World War II. At the final year of the World War II despite the declaration of the neutrality by the Iranian government, the country was occupied by the allied forces. The allied forces then urged Reza Shah to abdicate and installed his son Mohammad Reza as the new king of the country. The postwar situation was further complicated by Soviet aid to set up a local government called Azerbaijan People's Government in Northwest Iran, having Tabriz as its capital. The new Soviet-backed local government was run by Ja'far Pishevari and held power for one year starting from 1946. Pishevari's government gave more freedom to speech and education in Azerbaijani language and promoted local cultural heritage and gained some popularity among the residents. However, after the withdrawal of Soviet forces, Pishevari's limited armed forces were crushed by the Imperial Iranian army and the Iranian government retook control of the city. One of the major establishments in the period of Pishevari's government was opening of the University of Tabriz which played a major role in the later political movements and protests in the region.Maziar Behrooz, Rebels with a cause: failure of left in Iran, I.B.

For the next 30 years, after the collapse of Azerbaijan's autonomous government, Tabriz enjoyed a stable era until the revolution in 1979. During this period the city received many of investors in its industries and had transformed into a heavy industries hub in the northwest of Iran. The need for a strong workforce increased immigration from all around Azerbaijan toward Tabriz. During this era and because of the continuous policy of the government centralization in Tehran as well as changes in communication and transportation, the city lost its historical dominance in favour of being the gate for reform and modernization in the country. Starting with 1978 and with the heat of the Iranian Revolution, revolutionary movements of some of Tabriz residents played a major role in the revolution. After the revolution, the residents of the city were unsatisfied with the outcome, mainly because of the ignorance of the revolutionary government about the rights of the Azerbaijani minority . Another major source of dissatisfaction was the support of most of Iranian Azerbaijanis including Tabriz residents from a more liberal cleric, Grand Ayatollah Shariatmadari, who was against the content of the new constitution which was mixing religion and state together. The unrest in the city calmed down after brutal crush of the protesters in Tabriz and after house arrest of Shariatmadari. Aerial view of northeast Tabriz, May 2012 In the 1980s, due to the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, like the rest of the country, most of the construction and development projects in the city were stopped in order to fund the war costs. In addition to the indirect effects of the war, city's industrial zone, especially the oil refinery was also a major target for airstrikes by Iraqi's air forces because of the closeness to the Iraqi borderlines, and their strategic roles in the country's economy. With the escalation of the war, the attacks turned to War of the Cities and the air attacks later turned into the random strikes on the residential areas of the city in the later phase of the war.R. Bergquist, The role of airpower in the Iran-Iraq War, Air University Press, Washington DC, 1988. p. 46. & 57. In recent years, Tabriz is much more stable and the new developments in the city are rapidly changing the face of the city. Capital of Iran Tabriz was chosen as the capital by several rulers commencing from the time of Atropates. It was the capital of the Ilkhanate (Mongol) dynasty since 1265. During the Ghazan Khan era, who came into power in 1295, the city reached its highest splendour. The later realm stretched from the Amu Darya in the East to the Egypt borders in the West and from the Caucasus in the North to the Indian Ocean in the South.Wood, John E. and Tucker, Ernest (2006) History and Historiography of Post-Mongol Central Asia and the Middle East, Otto Harrassowitz Gmbh & Co and KG Wiesbaden, p. 530. It was again the capital of Iran during the Qara Qoyunlu dynasty from 1375 to 1468 and then during the Ag Qoyunlu within 1468‚Äì1501. Finally, it was capital of the Iranian Empire in the Safavid period from 1501 until their defeat in 1555.Richard Tapper. \\"Shahsevan in Safavid Persia\\", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 37, No. 3, 1974, p. 324.

Excavation sites  https://www.iranhotels.com/blog/The-Iron-Age-Museum-in- Tabriz In 2002, during a construction project at the north side of the Blue Mosque (Part of Silk Road Project), an ancient graveyard was revealed. This was kept secret until a construction worker alerted the authorities. Radiocarbon analysis by Allameh Tabatabai University has shown the background of the graves to be more than 3800 years old. A museum of these excavations including the Blue Mosque was opened to the public in 2006. The other excavation site is in Abbasi Street at the site of Rab'-e Rashidi, which was the location for an academic institution since approximately 700 years ago. It was established in Ilkhanid period.  City of Firsts  The City of Firsts or city of pioneers is an unofficial motto for Tabriz, a major city and provincial capital in north west of Iran. The motto is given because of the pioneering role of the city in modernization signs in Iran and its leading role in movement toward the formation of modern Iran. * Firsts of Tabriz in the Iranian History: * Printing Industry: The first publication house was founded by Prince Abbas Mirza in Tabriz, And 12 years later a second publication was established in Tehran. * Library: Tarbiat library, Iran's first public library was founded by Muhammad Ali tarbiat in 1921. * Guest house or Hotel: Tabriz is the first city in Iran where the new style hotels and motels have been built. *Cinema: The first public cinema in Iran (1900) *School: The first school of primary education (New approach) in Iran was founded by Haji-Mirza Hassan Roshdieh in Tabriz (1893). * Kindergartens and school for the Deaf & Mute: Jabbar Baghtcheban the first children's book author and publisher and founder of the first school for the Deaf & Mute in Iran.Samad Sardarinia. \\"Jabbar Baghtcheban\\", Azerbaijan's Celebrities, Second Edition 2000. * New Literature: Mirza Abdul'Rahim Talibov Tabrizi, founder of new composition and Mirza Fatali Akhundov, founder of the playwright in Iran. also Mirza-Agha Tabrizi the first Iranian playwright who has written plays to Persian language. * Banknote: During the Ghikhatukhan in Mongol empire, name of money was Chaw.

Geography = Topography  Tabriz is located in northwest of Iran in East Azerbaijan province between Eynali and Sahand mountains in a fertile area in shore of Aji River and Ghuri River. The local area is earthquake-prone and during its history, the city has been devastated and rebuilt several times.  Climate  Tabriz has a Continental climate with regular seasons (K√∂ppen Dsa) bordering cold semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSk). The annual precipitation is around , a good deal of which falls as snow during the winter months and rain in spring and autumn. The city enjoys mild and fine climate in spring, dry and semi-hot in summer, humid and rainy in autumn and snowy cold in winter. The average annual temperature is . Cool winds blow from east to west mostly in summer.  Environment pollution  Air pollution is one of the major environmental issues in Tabriz. Air pollution is due to increase of a number of cars in the commuting in the city and the polluting industries such as thermal power plants, petrochemical complexes and the oil refinery in the west of the city, air pollution levels increased continuously in the second half of the 20th century. With a mandate of national environmental codes by heavy industries, industrial air pollution is reduced in recent years. However, the air quality in the city is far away from world norms for clean air. An immediate environmental threat is the shrinkage and drying out of the Lake Urmia located in outskirts of Western Tabriz. The lake has faced a grave crisis since the late 20th century. Water depth reduction, increasing water salinity to saturation level and the appearance of vast salt fields around the lake, are alarming indications of gradual total desiccation of a unique ecosystem. This occurred due to global warming and ever-increasing demands for inadequate freshwater sources in the basin. It is feared in the near future low-lying clouds of airborne salt and minerals may hover over large areas around the lake, posing serious health hazards.H.

Main Municipality Office Authority for the city lies with the Mayor, who is elected by a municipal board. The municipal board is periodically elected by the city's residents. The Municipal central office is located at the Tabriz Municipality Palace.  Historic municipal districts  Tabriz is divided into 12 municipal districts.

The majority of the city's population are Azerbaijani people, followed by Persians, Armenians, Assyrians, and other People of Caucasus.  Language  The predominant language spoken in Tabriz is Azerbaijani language (Azerbaijani people call it T√ºrk√º or T√ºrki language), which is a Turkic language mutually intelligible with modern Turkish dialects. The language has a strong Iranian superstratum since it has been in close contact with the Persian language for many centuries. Similar to the other parts of Iran, the official language is Persian and the most inhabitants have native or near-native knowledge of Persian language, which is the major medium of education. Nevertheless, the Iranian constitution respects the right to speak and have limited educational facilities in other native languages, including Azerbaijani. For the first time, an academic program on Azerbaijani language opened at the University of Tabriz in 1999.Rasmus Christian Elling, Minorities in Iran: Nationalism and Ethnicity after Khomeini, Palgrave 2013 Other than Azerbaijani, there is a notable minority of Armenian speakers and a smaller minority of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic speakers.

Religion  After being crowned at Tabriz in 1501, Shah Ismail I announced the Twelver branch of Shia Islam as the official religion of the Safavid Empire. As a result of this royal order, the most Sunni population of Tabriz converted to Shia.John A A Boyle (Editor), Persia: History and Heritage, Routledge, 2011, p:38 Currently, the majority of people are followers of Shia Islam. The city has a visible Armenian Apostolic minority who follow Christianity. There used to be a small Jewish community, but most of them have moved to Tehran. There is a small, embattled community of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the city.Phyllis G. Jestice (Edit.), Holy People of the World: A Cross- cultural Encyclopedia, 2004, p. 92.

Yadollah Maftun Amini (born in 1926)Gholam-Reza Sabri-Tabrizi, Iran: A Child's Story, a Man's Experience, 1989, Mainstream Publishing Company, P. 168 The proximity to Sahand, a mountain in the south of the city, has been a source of inspiration for contemporary revolutionaries and poets alike. The power of this inspiring source, however, goes to much earlier times. Tabriz was a house for numerous Iranian writers, poets, and illumination movements. In old times the city notables supported poets and writers by organizing periodical meetings. Within its long history, it was a residence for many well known Iranian writers and poets. The list can start from the old-time Rumi, Qatran, Khaqani to recent years Samad Behrangi, Gholam-Hossein Sa'edi, Parvin E'tesami. The prominent Iranian Azeri poet Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar was born in Tabriz. The culture, social values, language and music is a mixture of what exists in the rest of Iran. Tabriz also has a special place in Persian literature, as the following sample of verses from some of Iran's best poets and authors illustrates: ÿ≥ÿßÿ±ÿ®ÿßŸÜÿß ÿ®ÿßÿ± ÿ®⁄Øÿ¥ÿß ÿ≤ ÿßÿ¥ÿ™ÿ±ÿßŸÜ ÿ¥Ÿáÿ± ÿ™ÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿ≤ ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ Ÿà ⁄©Ÿà€å ÿØŸÑÿ®ÿ±ÿßŸÜ Oh SƒÅrbƒÅn, have camels' cargo unloaded, For Tabriz is the neighborhood of the beloved. ‚ÄïMolana ÿπÿ≤€åÿ≤€å ÿØÿ± ÿßŸÇÿµÿß€å ÿ™ÿ®ÿ±€åÿ≤ ÿ®ŸàÿØ ⁄©Ÿá ŸáŸÖŸàÿßÿ±Ÿá ÿ®€åÿØÿßÿ± Ÿà ÿ¥ÿ®ÿÆ€åÿ≤ ÿ®ŸàÿØ A beloved lived in Tabriz away from sight, who was always alert and awake at night ‚ÄïBustan of Sadi ÿ™ÿß ÿ®Ÿá ÿ™ÿ®ÿ±€åÿ≤ŸÖ ÿØŸà ⁄Ü€åÿ≤ŸÖ ÿ≠ÿßÿµŸÑ ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ ŸÜ€åŸÖ ŸÜÿßŸÜ Ÿà ÿ¢ÿ® ŸÖŸáÿ±ÿßŸÜ ÿ±ŸàÿØ Ÿà ÿ®ÿ≥ As long as I live in Tabriz, two things I need not worry about, The half loaf of bread and the water of Mehranrud [river] are enough! ‚ÄïKhaqani ÿßŸäŸÜ ÿßÿ±ŸÉ ÿ®ŸÑŸÜÿØ ÿ¥Ÿáÿ± ÿ™ÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿ≤ ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ ÿßŸÅÿ±ÿßÿ¥ÿ™Ÿá ŸÇÿßŸÖÿ™Ÿê ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸäÿ¥ ÿ±ÿß This is the tall Arg of Tabriz City, Raised its outstanding height there! ‚ÄïMaftun  Music  A century-long autocratic nation-building policy of central governments in Iran has succeeded in cultural assimilation in the favour of a government-sanctioned culture.Ervand Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 2008, Cambridge University Press As a result, Tabriz, by the turn of the 20th century had nearly become devoid of its once characteristic cultural identity. Thanks to the more liberal policies of the Khatami era (1998‚Äì2006), a cultural renaissance took place and the local music was revitalized. The traditional Azeri music is divided into two distinct types, the music of \\"ashugh\\" and the \\"mugham\\". Mugham, despite its similarity to Persian classical music, was not common among Iranian Azeris. In recent years, however, mugham is gaining popularity among the educated middle-class young generation. For instance, Nasir Atapur, from Tabriz, was the laureate of Mugam contest 2007. The ashugh music had survived in a mountainous region of Qaradaƒü and presently is identified as the characteristic form of music in all Azerbaijan. The ashugh music, throughout its long history, had been associated with nomadic life in mountainous regions and used to be dismissed as back- country folklore. The recent identity renaissance of Azeri speaking people has elevated the status of Ashughs as the guardians of national culture. The newfound unprecedented popularity and frequent concerts and performances in urban settings have resulted in rapid innovative developments aiming to enhance the urban-appealing aspects of these ashugh performances. The main factor for these developments was the opening of academic style music classes in Tabriz by master Ashugs, such as A≈üiq Imran Heyd…ôri. Ashugs (A≈üiq in Azeri language stemmed from the Arabic word for lover) were travelling bards who sang and played saz, an eight or ten string plucking instrument in the form of a long-necked lute. Their roots can be traced back to at least the 7th century according to the Turkic epic Dede Korkut.G. Lewis (translator), The Book of Dede Korkut, Penguin Classics(1988) Naturally, the music has evolved in the course of the grand migration and ensuing feuds with the original inhabitants the acquired lands. Still, the essence of the original epics, i.e. metamorphic description of life in pastoral terms with direct reference to the mountainous landscape, persists to the present time. The characteristic aspect of the Ashugh music is its frequent allusions to a mountain with the intention of arousing an emotional state with a tone of mild melancholy in a listener. The first verses of a contemporary Ashug song, composed by M…ôh…ômm…ôd Araz, may well represent the essence of Ashugh musicA. O.Senarslan, Women asiqs of Azerbaijan: tradition and transformation, PhD Thesis, University of Wisconsin- Madison (2008) may clarify the said statement.

Grube, Peerless Images: Persian Painting and Its Sources, 2002, p.44 The paintings date back to the early 14th century and show significant influence from Chinese and Chinese-influenced pictures.

Made of wooden beams and pulley systems, the device was used to lift an actor into the air, usually representing flight. This stage machine was particularly used to bring gods onto the stage from above,Plato, Crat. 425d; Clit. 407a hence the Latin term deus ex machina (\\"god from the machine\\"). Euripides' use of the mechane in Medea (431 BC) is a notable use of the machine for a non-divine character. It was also often used by Aeschylus. It was used to allow actors playing gods to fly through the air. Use in ancient Rome Stage machines were also used in ancient Rome, e.g. during the sometimes highly dramatic performances at funerals. For Julius Caesar's funeral service, Appian reports a mechane that was used to present a blood-stained wax effigy of the deceased dictator to the funeral crowd. The mechane was used to turn the body in all directions.App. B.C. 2.147. œÑ·Ω∏ Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ œÉ·ø∂ŒºŒ±, ·Ω°œÇ ·ΩïœÄœÑŒπŒøŒΩ ·ºêœÄ·Ω∂ ŒªŒ≠œáŒøœÖœÇ, Œø·Ωêœá ·ºëœâœÅ·æ∂œÑŒø. œÑ·Ω∏ Œ¥·Ω≤ ·ºÄŒΩŒ¥œÅŒµŒØŒ∫ŒµŒªŒøŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫ ŒºŒ∑œáŒ±ŒΩ·øÜœÇ ·ºêœÄŒµœÉœÑœÅŒ≠œÜŒµœÑŒø œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑ·øÉ. Suetonius only reports a tropaeum to which the effigy (simulacrum) was affixed. (Jul. 84) Geoffrey Sumi proposes that the use of the mechane \\"hinted at Caesar's divinity.\\"Geoffrey S. Sumi: Ceremony and Power ‚Äî Performing Politics in Rome between Republic and Empire (Ann Arbor 2005. 107‚Äì109, chapter Caesar ex machina). This is highly unlikely because Appian doesn't describe the mechane as a genuine deus-ex-machina device. Furthermore Caesar's apotheosis wasn't legally conducted until 42 BC and Caesar had only been worshipped unofficially as divus during his lifetime. First and foremost, Marcus Antonius attempted to arouse the masses as a means to strengthen Caesar's esteem as well as his own political power.That Caesar's resurrectio as god happened later during the funeral as he was cremated, and that it spawned the early Caesarian cult by the Pseudo-Marius, can't explain Antonius' intentions for using a mechane during the funeral. Religious significance In Christian liturgy the mechane has also been identified with the cross.

Characteristics Members of the family Mysidae are distinguished from other mysids by the fact that the first pereopod (walking leg) has a well-developed exopod (outer branch), the carpopropodus of the endopod (inner branch) of the 3rd to 8th pereopods is divided into sub-segments and there are statocysts on the endopod of the uropods (posterior appendages). Female petalophthalmidans have two or three oostegites (flexible bristly flaps) forming the base of the marsupium or brood pouch under the thorax, apart from the subfamily Boreomysinae, which has seven pairs of oostegites.

Temasek (also spelt Temasik) is an early recorded name of a settlement on the site of modern Singapore. The name appears in early Malay and Javanese literature, and it is also recorded in Yuan and Ming Chinese documents as Danmaxi ( or ). Two distinct settlements were recorded in Temasek ‚Äì Long Ya Men and Ban Zu. The name is used in modern-day Singapore for national honours as well as institutions and corporations. Name The origin of the name Temasek is uncertain, but it has been proposed that it was derived from the Malay word tasik meaning \\"lake\\" or \\"sea\\", and may mean here \\"place surrounded by the sea\\", or Sea Town. Another suggestion is that it may be a reference to a king of Srivijaya, Maharaja Tan ma sa na ho. The name appears as Tumasik in the Old Javanese epic poem written in 1365, Nagarakretagama. The name is also mentioned twice in the Malay Annals, and referred to in the Javanese work Pararaton. Temasek is described in the account by the Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan who visited the island around 1330 and wrote about a Malay settlement called Danmaxi, a transcription of the name Temasek. In a version of Marco Polo's account of his travel, a place named Chiamassie that could be Temasik was mentioned in relation to the island kingdom of Malayur. Temasek may have also been mentioned in Vietnamese records as Sach Ma Tich in the 14th century. Some time in the 14th century, the name Temasek was replaced by Singapura, a Malay name derived from Sanskrit meaning \\"Lion City\\". Legend has it that the name was given by Sang Nila Utama when he visited the island in 1299 and saw an unknown creature, which he was informed was a lion. Although Chinese records continued to use the name Temasek for some time afterwards (for example in the Mao Kun map) and it was also used in The Malay Annals, the name Temasek had become obsolete and did not appear in European maps and documents from 1500 to 1800. It was revived in colonial and more modern times, and is now used as names for institutions, corporations and national honours in Singapore. History While the early history of Singapore is obscured by myth and legend, some conclusions can be drawn from archaeological evidence and from written references by travellers. Archaeology points to an urbanised settlement on the site by the 14th century. At its height, the city boasted a large earthen city wall and moat; many of the buildings were built with stone and brick foundations. Remains of old pottery, coins, jewellery and other artifacts have been found, with many of these artifacts believed to be imported from various parts of China, India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. These are sometimes seen as evidence of the city's status as a regional trade centre. An aquatic route, part of the larger Silk route, passed through Temasek. From the 7th to the 13th centuries, the island of Singapore was controlled by the Srivijaya empire based in Sumatra. Diplomatic relationship between Temasek and Vietnam may have begun in the 13th century. Temasek was a fortified city and trading centre in the 14th century. It was recorded that during the Yuan dynasty, envoys were sent to Long Ya Men (Dragon's Teeth Gate, thought to be the entrance of Keppel Harbour) in 1320 to obtain tame elephants. The people of Long Ya Men then returned in 1325 with a tribute and trade mission to China. In around 1330, the Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan visited the island and mentioned two distinct settlements in Temasek: Long Ya Men and Ban Zu (a transcription of the Malay name pancur meaning a \\"spring\\"). In his work Daoyi Zhil√ºe, Wang described Long Ya Men as the two hills of Temasek that looked like \\"Dragon's teeth\\" between which a strait runs, and wrote: Wang further mentioned that lakawood and tin were products there and the natives traded with Chinese from Quanzhou, but Chinese junks on their way back from the Western Oceans (Ë•øÊ¥ã) may be met by pirates there who attacked with two to three hundred perahus (boats). The description of the people may be the first known record of the Orang Laut who inhabited the region. Ban Zu was described as being sited on a hill, thought to be today's Fort Canning Hill, located behind Long Ya Men. In contrast to those of Long Ya Men who were prone to acts of piracy, the inhabitants here were described as honest. They also \\"wear their hair short, with turban of gold-brocaded satin\\", and red- coloured clothing.

In 1928, several pieces of gold ornaments dating to the mid-14th century were discovered at Fort Canning Hill. Wang also reported that the Siamese attacked the city moat of Temasek with around 70 ships a few years before he visited, and the city successfully resisted the attack for a month.

The Nagarakretagama written in 1365 listed Tumasik as a vassal of the Majapahit. Portuguese sources indicate that during the late 14th century, Temasek was a Siamese vassal whose ruler was killed by Parameswara from Palembang. Parameswara was driven from Palembang by the Javanese after Parameswara challenged the Majapahit by setting up a lion throne that symbolized a revival of Palembang's claim over the Srivijaya empire. According to a Portuguese account, Parameswara fled to Temasek, and eight days later killed the local chief with the title Sang Aji, named Sangesinga in a later account. It has been proposed that Temasek changed its name to \\"Singapura\\" in this period rather than in 1299 as suggested by the legend of Sang Nila Utama given in the Malay Annals. Portuguese sources indicate that Parameswara ruled Singapura for five years, he was then attacked by either the Majapahit or the Siamese, forcing him to move on to Melaka where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca. Singapura came under the influence of the Malacca in the 15th century and, after the fall of Malacca to the Portuguese, the control of the Malay Sultanate of Johor in the 16th century. A settlement there was finally burnt to the ground by the Portuguese in 1613 and the island sank into obscurity for two hundred years until the early 19th century with the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles. Singapore's national honours The Republic's two most important national honours are titled Bintang Temasek (The Star of Temasek for acts of exceptional courage and skill or exhibiting conspicuous devotion to duty in circumstances of extreme danger) and the Darjah Utama Temasek (Order of Temasek, for outstanding and exceptional contributions to the country).

The fetching of opcodes well in advance, prior to their need for execution increases the overall efficiency of the processor boosting its speed. The processor no longer has to wait for the memory access operations for the subsequent instruction opcode to complete. This architecture was prominently used in the Intel 8086 microprocessor. Introduction Pipelining was brought to the forefront of computing architecture design during the 1960s due to the need for faster and more efficient computing. Pipelining is the broader concept and most modern processors load their instructions some clock cycles before they execute them. This is achieved by pre-loading machine code from memory into a prefetch input queue. This behavior only applies to von Neumann computers (that is, not Harvard architecture computers) that can run self- modifying code and have some sort of instruction pipelining. Nearly all modern high-performance computers fulfill these three requirements. Usually, the prefetching behavior of the PIQ is invisible to the programming model of the CPU. However, there are some circumstances where the behavior of PIQ is visible, and needs to be taken into account by the programmer. When the x86-processor changes mode from realmode to protected mode and vice versa, the PIQ has to be flushed, or else the CPU will continue to translate the machine code as if it were written in its last mode. If the PIQ is not flushed, the processor might translate its codes wrong and generate an invalid instruction exception. When executing self-modifying code, a change in the processor code immediately in front of the current location of execution might not change how the processor interprets the code, as it is already loaded into its PIQ. It simply executes its old copy already loaded in the PIQ instead of the new and altered version of the code in its RAM and/or cache. This behavior of the PIQ can be used to determine if code is being executed inside an emulator or directly on the hardware of a real CPU. Most emulators will probably never simulate this behavior. If the PIQ-size is zero (changes in the code always affect the state of the processor immediately), it can be deduced that either the code is being executed in an emulator or the processor invalidates the PIQ upon writes to addresses loaded in the PIQ. Performance evaluation based on queuing theory It was A.K Erlang (1878-1929) who first conceived of a queue as a solution to congestion in telephone traffic. Different queueing models are proposed in order to approximately simulate the real time queuing systems so that those can be analysed mathematically for different performance specifications. Queuing models can be represented using Kendall's notation: :A1/A2/A3/A4 where: * A1 is the distribution of time between two arrivals * A2 is the service time distribution * A3 is the total number of servers * A4 is the capacity of system # M/M/1 Model (Single Queue Single Server/ Markovian): In this model, elements of queue are served on a first-come, first-served basis. Given the mean arrival and service rates, then actual rates vary around these average values randomly and hence have to be determined using a cumulative probability distribution function. # M/M/r Model: This model is a generalization of the basic M/M/1 model where multiple servers operate in parallel. This kind of model can also model scenarios with impatient users who leave the queue immediately if they are not receiving service. This can also be modeled using a Bernoulli process having only two states, success and failure. The best example of this model is our regular land-line telephone systems. # M/G/1 Model (Takacs' finite input Model) : This model is used to analyze advanced cases. Here the service time distribution is no longer a Markov process. This model considers the case of more than one failed machine being repaired by single repairman. Service time for any user is going to increase in this case. Generally in applications like prefetch input queue, M/M/1 Model is popularly used because of limited use of queue features. In this model in accordance with microprocessors, the user takes the role of the execution unit and server is the bus interface unit. Instruction queue The processor executes a program by fetching the instructions from memory and executing them. Usually the processor execution speed is much faster than the memory access speed. Instruction queue is used to prefetch the next instructions in a separate buffer while the processor is executing the current instruction. With a four stage pipeline, the rate at which instructions are executed can be up to four times that of sequential execution. The processor usually has two separate units for fetching the instructions and for executing the instructions. The implementation of a pipeline architecture is possible only if the bus interface unit and the execution unit are independent. While the execution unit is decoding or executing an instruction which does not require the use of the data and address buses, the bus interface unit fetches instruction opcodes from the memory. This process is much faster than sending out an address, reading the opcode and then decoding and executing it. Fetching the next instruction while the current instruction is being decoded or executed is called pipelining. The 8086 architecture has a six-byte prefetch instruction pipeline, while the 8088 has a four-byte prefetch. As the Execution Unit is executing the current instruction, the bus interface unit reads up to six (or four) bytes of opcodes in advance from the memory. The queue lengths were chosen based on simulation studies. An exception is encountered when the execution unit encounters a branch instruction i.e. either a jump or a call instruction. In this case, the entire queue must be dumped and the contents pointed to by the instruction pointer must be fetched from memory. Drawbacks Processors implementing the instruction queue prefetch algorithm are rather technically advanced. The CPU design level complexity of the such processors is much higher than for regular processors. This is primarily because of the need to implement two separate units, the BIU and EU, operating separately. As the complexity of these chips increases, the cost also increases. These processors are relatively costlier than their counterparts without the prefetch input queue. However, these disadvantages are greatly offset by the improvement in processor execution time. After the introduction of prefetch instruction queue in the 8086 processor, all successive processors have incorporated this feature. x86 example code code_starts_here: mov bx, ahead mov word ptr cs:[bx], 9090h ahead: jmp near to_the_end ; Some other code to_the_end: This self-modifying program will overwrite the jmp to_the_end with two NOPs (which is encoded as 0x9090). The jump jmp near to_the_end is assembled into two bytes of machine code, so the two NOPs will just overwrite this jump and nothing else. (That is, the jump is replaced with a do-nothing-code.) Because the machine code of the jump is already read into the PIQ, and probably also already executed by the processor (superscalar processors execute several instructions at once, but they \\"pretend\\" that they don't because of the need for backward compatibility), the change of the code will not have any change of the execution flow. Example program to detect size This is an example NASM-syntax self-modifying x86-assembly language algorithm that determines the size of the PIQ: code_starts_here: xor bx, bx ; zero register bx xor ax, ax ; zero register ax mov dx, cs mov [code_segment], dx ; \\"calculate\\" codeseg in the far jump below (edx here too) around: cmp ax, 1 ; check if ax has been altered je found_size ; 0x90 = opcode \\"nop\\" (NO oPeration) mov byte [nop_field+bx], 0x90 inc bx db 0xEA ; 0xEA = opcode \\"far jump\\" dw flush_queue ; should be followed by offset (rm = \\"dw\\", pm = \\"dd\\") code_segment: dw 0 ; and then the code segment (calculated above) flush_queue: ; 0x40 = opcode \\"inc ax\\" (INCrease ax) mov byte [nop_field+bx], 0x40 nop_field: times 256 nop jmp around found_size: ; ; register bx now contains the size of the PIQ ; this code is for real mode and 16-bit protected mode, but it could easily be changed into ; running for 32-bit protected mode as well. just change the \\"dw\\" for ; the offset to \\"dd\\". you need also change dx to edx at the top as ; well. (dw and dx = 16 bit addressing, dd and edx = 32 bit addressing) ; What this code does is basically that it changes the execution flow, and determines by brute force how large the PIQ is. \\"How far away do I have to change the code in front of me for it to affect me?\\" If it is too near (it is already in the PIQ) the update will not have any effect. If it is far enough, the change of the code will affect the program and the program has then found the size of the processor's PIQ. If this code is being executed under multitasking OS, the context switch may lead to the wrong value.

The picture was based upon an episode of the 1960 Sam Peckinpah television series The Westerner called \\"Line Camp,\\" also written and directed by Tom Gries. Heston mentioned that this was his favorite film in which he appeared.Charlton Heston: The Last Interview on YouTube The supporting cast features Ben Johnson, Bruce Dern, and Slim Pickens. Plot A trail drive is coming to an end, with the resulting payoff of the now out-of-work trail hands. A trio of punchers, Blue (Lee Majors), Dutchy (Anthony Zerbe), and an aging Will Penny (Charlton Heston) decide to drift south and avoid the oncoming winter. One morning Blue is about to fire at a bull elk near a river bottom. Mysteriously, the elk is shot by an unseen party. As Blue and Dutchy move in to claim the elk anyway, they encounter the shooter, a \\"rawhider\\" and his family. They rightfully contest the right to the meat. Gunfire erupts, and Will shows up, shoots and kills one of the rawhider's family. The rawhider swears a biblical revenge. Dutchy accidentally wounds himself in the exchange, so Will and Blue head to a nearby trail store, where they encounter Catherine Allen (Joan Hackett) and her son Horace (Jon Gries). After leaving Dutchy at the doctor, Blue decides to look for a job in the town, while Will proceeds alone. He comes across a horse without a rider and locates a dead cowboy, thrown from his saddle. Will turns the body over to the ranch that he rode for and is offered a job. Will hires on to ride the far-off boundaries of Flat Iron ranch over the winter. As he arrives at the upper range, he finds Catherine and Horace staying in the line-rider's cabin after being abandoned by their guide. He rides away to inspect the fence line, warning them that they must be gone when he returns in one week. The next morning as Will is sleeping outside near the fence, he is ambushed and savagely beaten up by the rawhider group. They leave Will for dead, but he drags himself to the cabin, where he is slowly nursed back to health by Catherine. As the winter passes, Will and Catherine fall in love, and Will develops fatherly affection for Horace. As Will and Catherine prepare for Christmas, the Quint family bursts into the cabin, force Will into hard labor, and coerce Catherine into making plans to marry one of the ne'er do well, belligerent, hair-trigger sons. After some days, Catherine distracts two of the Quints so Will can make an escape. A few minutes later, his two former saddle pals Blue and Dutchy arrive looking for him. The three return to attack the cabin to free Catherine and Horace, using a bag of sulfur that was at the cabin to smoke out the rawhiders. Ultimately, Will realizes that he is too set in his ways to settle down into a domestic life. Deeply regretful about what he is leaving behind, he rides away from the woman and boy, never to return.

It is a resident breeder in the swamps and shallow lakes of Africa, southern Arabia, and southern India; it has also apparently extirpated in Madagascar. Description Dorsal view showing characteristic pink back Pelecanus rufescens - MHNT Formation flying It is a relatively small pelican, although by no means is it a small bird. Its length is from , wingspan is and body mass is from . The bill is in length. (2011). (2011). The plumage is grey and white, with a pinkish hue on the back occasionally apparent (never in the deep pink of a flamingo). The top of the bill is yellow and the pouch is usually greyish. Breeding adults have long feather plumes on the head. It shares its habitat with the great white pelican, which is generally larger and has white instead of greyish plumage. Habitat and breeding The pink-backed pelican is found in a range of aquatic habitats, but prefers quiet backwaters with shallow water, avoiding steep, vegetated lake banks. It prefers for freshwater lakes, swamps, large slow-flowing rivers, and seasonal pools but also frequents reservoirs, seasonally flooded land and flood-plains near river mouths. It may occur on alkaline and saline lakes and lagoons, and can sometimes be found along the coast in bays and estuaries (although seldom on open seashore). The species tends to roost and breed in trees (e.g. mangroves), but will also roost on sandy islands, cliffs, coral reefs and sand-dunes. Nesting trees have many nests built close together. These nests are re-used every year until the trees collapse, although the birds will normally remain in the area. The species nests colonially in trees, reeds or low bushes along waterfronts as well as (less often) on the ground on sandy islands and in mangroves. Its nest is a large heap of sticks and may be 10‚Äì50 m above the ground. The female lays two to three large white eggs and later the chicks feed by plunging their heads deep into the adult's pouch and taking the partially digested regurgitated fish. Diet Food is usually fish (of any size up to 450 g, usually in the 80-290 g range) and amphibians, and is usually obtained by fishing in groups. Among the fish preyed upon are cichlids like Haplochromis and Tilapia.

Bittan (born July 2, 1949) is an American keyboardist and pianist, best known as a long-time member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. Bittan, nicknamed The Professor, joined the E Street Band on August 23, 1974, and plays the piano, organ, accordion and synthesizers.'Kingdom of Days' by Raoul Hernandez, The Austin Chronicle, April 3, 2009 Bittan was inducted as a member of the E Street Band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2014. Aside from his membership in Springsteen's band, Bittan has played on albums as a session musician, primarily for singer-songwriters and rock and pop artists, including Jon Bon Jovi, David Bowie, Jackson Browne, Lucinda Williams, Tracy Chapman, Chicago, Catie Curtis, Dire Straits, Bob Dylan, Peter Gabriel, Ian Hunter, Meat Loaf, Stevie Nicks, Bob Seger, Lou Reed, Celine Dion, Nelly Furtado, Patty Smyth, Jim Steinman and Bonnie Tyler. Life and career Bittan was born in Belle Harbor, Queens, New York City. He is a longtime member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, and has performed on the majority of Springsteen's albums, beginning with Born to Run (1975). In Springsteen's band introductions, Bittan's \\"Professor\\" moniker was given because (supposedly) he was the only member of the group with a college diploma. Bittan provided background vocals for most of the songs on Born to Run, along with Steven Van Zandt. His voice is also featured slightly on the vocal weaving in \\"Out in the Street\\". However, from the Born in the U.S.A. Tour on, his voice was no longer used. When Springsteen decided to break his connection with the E Street Band in 1989, Roy Bittan was the one member he retained, both in studio and on the \\"Other Band\\" Tour. With the E Street Band, Bittan uses a Yamaha grand piano, preferring the bright sound to cut through the group's sound compared with other acoustic models. He has also been known to use Yamaha, Korg and Kurzweil keyboards as part of his live rig. His riffs and melody lines have become signatures for the Springsteen sound. Roy is an avid accordion player, which was a skill he seldom used with the E Street Band until playing \\"American Land\\" as the closing number on the 2007‚Äì2008 Magic Tour and then later taking the instrument's part on \\"4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\\" after the death of bandmate Danny Federici. Roy Bittan is Jewish.'Why Jews Should Love Bruce Springsteen' by Howard Blas, The Times of Israel, April 5, 2012 Discography Bittan played piano nearly exclusively on Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album Bat Out of Hell. Composer Jim Steinman wanted Bittan for the album due to his love for Springsteen's early work, particularly on Born to Run. Since then, Bittan has regularly and nearly exclusively collaborated with Steinman, appearing on three more Meat Loaf albums (most notably Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell), Steinman's solo album Bad for Good, an Air Supply single, a Barbra Streisand single, an album by Pandora's Box, Total Eclipse of the Heart, and others. Bittan played on the Dire Straits album Making Movies (1980). Mark Knopfler's decision to have the keyboardist on the album's lineup was reportedly influenced by his affection for \\"Because the Night\\", a keyboard-driven hit song cowritten by Springsteen and Patti Smith. Bittan played on the 1978 second solo album from Peter Gabriel, appearing on several tracks including \\"On the Air\\", \\"Mother of Violence\\", \\"D.I.Y.\\" and \\"White Shadow\\". Bittan played on two David Bowie albums, Station to Station (1976) and Scary Monsters (1980). Bittan played an important part in the sound Stevie Nicks created for her solo debut away from Fleetwood Mac, Bella Donna (1981). About the time that the album reached number one in the United States (and Springsteen's The River Tour concluded), Bittan joined as a sideman on a short tour with Nicks along with some of the other top musicians of the day: Benmont Tench on organ, bass guitarist Bob Glaub, Waddy Wachtel on guitar, Russ Kunkel on drums, and Bobbeye Hall on percussion. Bittan also played on Nicks' second solo album The Wild Heart and has continued to play with her sporadically. Bittan produced and played on Jimmie Mack and the Jumpers (1980) Bittan produced and played piano on Disappear Fear's 1996 album Seed in the Sahara. Bittan played piano on the track entitled \\"Heart and Soul\\" on Shwayze and Cisco Adler's second album, Let It Beat. Bittan produced and played accordion on Lucinda Williams album Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. He also played accordion on Nelly Furtado's album The Spirit Indestructible, on the track \\"Waiting for the Night\\". Bittan released his first solo album, a collection of instrumental songs, Out of the Box in November 2014.

The phrase was coined in 1903 by Andrew Ingraham but is best known through its quotation in 1923 by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards in their book The Meaning of Meaning, and has been since referred to in a number of cultural contexts. History Coined in 1903 by Andrew Ingraham, the sentence became more widely known through its quotation in 1923 by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards in their book The Meaning of Meaning (p. 46). Ogden and Richards refer to Ingraham as an \\"able but little known writer\\", and quote his following dialogue: Deriving meaning This can be seen in the following dialogue: :Q: What is the gostak? :A: The gostak is what distims the doshes. :Q: What's distimming? :A: Distimming is what the gostak does to the doshes. :Q: Okay, but what are doshes? :A: The doshes are what the gostak distims. In this case, it is possible to describe the grammatical and syntactical relationships between the terms in the sentence‚Äîthat gostak is a noun subject, distimming is a transitive verb, and doshes is a plural direct object‚Äîeven though there is no fact of the matter about what a gostak or distimming or doshes actually are. Cultural references The phrase appears in a number of subsequent cultural contexts including: Science fiction Dr. Miles Breuer wrote a story, published in Amazing Stories for March 1930 and now considered a classic, titled \\"The Gostak and the Doshes\\" whose protagonist pops into an alternative world in which the phrase is a political slogan that induces sufficient umbrage throughout the populace to declare justified, righteous war. Other writers have picked up on the reference, notably David Gerrold. Interactive fiction The phrase is the namesake of an interactive fiction game called The Gostak, written by Carl Muckenhoupt. Most of the text of the game is in an entirely unknown language (fundamentally English in syntax and grammar, but with much of the vocabulary and even idiomatic constructions changed) which the player must decipher, not only to understand the game's text but also to type commands in the same language.

The riot occurred in the aftermath of the 1969 Malaysian general election when opposition parties made gains at the expense of the ruling coalition, the Alliance Party. Official reports put the number of deaths due to the riots at 196, although Western diplomatic sources at the time suggested a toll of close to 600, with most of the victims Chinese. The racial riots led to a declaration of a state of national emergency or Darurat by the Yang di- Pertuan Agong resulting in the suspension of the Parliament by the Malaysian government, while the National Operations Council (NOC), also known as the Majlis Gerakan Negara (MAGERAN), was established as a caretaker government to temporarily govern the country between 1969 and 1971. The event is significant in Malaysian politics as it led to the first Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman stepping down from office to be succeeded by Tun Abdul Razak, and eventually resulted in a change in government policy that would favour Malays by the implementation of the New Economic Policy (NEP).  Precursors = Ethnic divide  On 31 August 1957, Malaya gained its independence from Britain. The country however suffered from a sharp division of wealth between the Chinese who dominated most urban areas and were perceived to be in control of a large portion of the country's economy, and the Malays, who were generally poorer and more rural. The special privileged position of Malay political power however is guaranteed under Article 153 of the Constitution written during Malayan independence. There were heated debates between Malay groups wanting radical measures to institutionalise Malay Supremacy (Ketuanan Melayu), while Chinese groups called for their 'racial' interest to be protected, and non- Malay opposition party members argued for a 'Malaysian Malaysia' rather than Malay privilege. Amid an undercurrent of racial tensions, in 1963, Malaysia was formed as a federation that incorporated Malaya (Peninsular Malaysia), Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak. There had been several incidents of racial conflict between Malays and Chinese before the 1969 riots. For example, in Penang, hostility between the races turned into violence during the centenary celebration of George Town in 1957 which resulted in several days of fighting and a number of deaths, and there were further disturbances in 1959 and 1964, as well as a riot in 1967 which originated as a protest against currency devaluation but turned into racial killings. In Singapore, the antagonism between the races led to the 1964 Race Riots which contributed to the separation of Singapore from Malaysia on 9 August 1965.  1969 national election  In the 1969 election, the governing coalition the Alliance Party faced a strong challenge from the opposition parties, in particular the two newly formed and mainly Chinese parties Democratic Action Party (DAP) and Parti Gerakan. The election was preceded by outbreaks of racial incidents that contributed to a tense atmosphere. A Malay political worker was killed by a Chinese gang in Penang, while a Chinese youth was shot and killed by police in Kuala Lumpur. Radical opponents called for the boycott of the election and threatened violence, but the funeral procession of the shot youth which was held before the election day passed peacefully. The general election was held on 10 May 1969, the election day itself passed without any incidents. The result showed that the Alliance had won less than half of the popular vote, a large setback for the ruling coalition. On the national level, the Alliance had gained a majority in the number of seats in the Parliament, albeit a significantly reduced one. The number of seats won by the Chinese component of the Alliance, the Malaysian Chinese Association, had been reduced by half. On the state level, the Alliance had only gained the majority in Selangor by co- operating with the sole independent candidate as the Opposition had tied with the Alliance for control of the Selangor state legislature (although at that time immediately after the election it was unclear that the Alliance would still have control). The Alliance lost control of Kelantan (to PAS) and Perak, and the opposition Gerakan won control of the state government in Penang.  Post-election celebrations  On the night of 11 and 12 May, the Opposition parties DAP and Gerakan celebrated their success in the election. In particular, a large Gerakan procession welcomed the Gerakan leader V. David. The parades by the opposition parties were alleged to be highly provocative, with non-Malays taunting Malays. Some supporters of the opposition were said to have driven past the residence of the Selangor chief minister and demanded that he abandon the residence in favour of a Chinese. The celebrations by the opposition parties were seen as an attack on Malay political power. Although the election results still favoured the Malays despite losses, the Malay newspaper Utusan Melayu suggested in an editorial that the results had jeopardised the future of Malay rule, and that prompt action was required to shore it up. On 12 May members of UMNO Youth indicated to Selangor Menteri Besar Dato' Harun Haji Idris that they wanted to hold a victory parade. UMNO then announced a procession, which would start from the Harun bin Idris's residence. Tunku Abdul Rahman would later call the retaliatory parade \\"inevitable, as otherwise the party members would be demoralised after the show of strength by the Opposition and the insults that had been thrown at them\\".Hwang, In-Won (2003). Personalized Politics: The Malaysian State under Mahathir, p. 78. Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. . Malays were brought from the rural areas into Kuala Lumpur, which was then a predominantly Chinese city. Thousands of Malays, some of them armed, arrived to join the parade.  Rioting = Early events  The UMNO procession was planned for the evening at 7.30 pm on Tuesday 13 May. On the morning of 13 May, Malays began to gather at the residence of Selangor Menteri Besar Dato' Harun Haji Idris on Jalan Raja Muda on the edge of Kampung Baru, although some were already there as early as Sunday evening. The Malays came from various parts of Selangor such as Morib (Harun's constituency) and Banting, and some may have came from parts of Perak. According to the NOC official report, at around 6 pm, fist fights broke out in Setapak between a group of Malays from Gombak travelling to the rally and Chinese bystanders who taunted them, and this escalated into bottle and stone throwing. News of the fighting then reached the gathering crowd in Jalan Raja Muda, and shortly before 6.30 pm, many Malays broke off from the rallying point at the Chief Minister's house and headed through adjoining Chinese sections. The Malays, armed with parangs and kris, burned cars and shops, killed and looted in the Chinese areas; according to Time, at least eight Chinese were killed in the initial attack. Once violence broke out, it spread rapidly and uncontrollably throughout the city within 45 minutes, to Jalan Campbell, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman (Batu Road), Kampung Datuk Keramat, Kampung Pandan, Cheras and Kampung Kerinchi.  Retaliations and armed response  According to John Slimming, who wrote an account of the riot in 1969, the Chinese were taken by surprise and did not retaliate for more than an hour. The NOC official report, however, suggested that Chinese secret society elements had prepared for trouble and were in action when the violence started in Kampung Baru. In Batu Road, Chinese and Indian shopkeepers began to form themselves into an improvised defence force, while a Malay mob attempting to storm the Chow Kit Road area were met with armed secret society gang members and ran. The Chinese attacked Malays who were found in Chinese areas, and Malay patrons in cinemas were singled out and killed. They also attempted to burn down the UMNO headquarters on Batu Road and besieged Salak South Police Station. Early in the evening the rioters were met by police, who used tear gas in an attempt to control them. A 24-hour curfew for Kuala Lumpur was announced on the radio at 7.35 pm and repeated on television at 8 pm. Later, between 8.30 and 9.00 pm, a shoot-to-kill order was given by Inspector General of Police Mohamed Salleh bin Ismael. This was followed by another shoot-to-kill order from the Chief of Armed Forces, General Tunku Osman Jiwa. The army was deployed and they entered the areas affected by rioting at around 10 pm. Many people who were unaware of the curfew order were shot. Some were also shot while standing in their own doorways and gardens. Foreign correspondents reported seeing members of the Royal Malay Regiment firing into Chinese shop-houses for no apparent reason. By 5 am the next morning, the authorities at Kuala Lumpur General Hospital reported that there were about 80 dead at the hospital. Members of the hospital staff also reported that the initial casualties between 7 and 8.30 pm had all been Chinese suffering from parang slashes and stab wounds, but that between 8.30 and 10.30 pm the victims were equally divided between Chinese and Malays. However, after about 10.30 pm the casualties were almost all Chinese, with nearly all of them suffering from gunshot wounds.  Later events  The army gathered at crucial road junctions and patrolled the main streets, but even though a curfew had been announced, young men in areas such as Kampung Baru and Pudu ignored the order. Although most of the killings occurred on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the burning and looting of Chinese shops and houses by Malays continued with most incidences of serious arson occurring on Thursday night and Friday. Over 450 houses were burnt. People displaced by the riots, most of them Chinese, were sent to official refugee centres in different parts of town ‚Äì the Malays to Stadium Negara, and the Chinese to Stadium Merdeka, Chinwoo Stadium, and Shaw Road School. By Sunday, the number of Chinese refugees had increased to 3,500 in Merdeka Stadium, 1,500 in Chinwoo Stadium, and 800 in Shaw Road School, while the Malays in Stadium Negara had decreased from 650 on Thursday to 250 on Sunday. Over a thousand refugees were still left in Merdeka Stadium a month after the riot. The curfew was relaxed briefly but quickly reimposed on Thursday morning. It was lifted again for three hours on Saturday morning. The curfew was gradually relaxed as the situation slowly returned to normal, but by the end of the month the curfew was still in force from 3 in the afternoon until 6.30 in the morning. The violence was concentrated in urban areas, and except for minor disturbances in Malacca, Perak, Penang and neighbouring Singapore, where the populations of Chinese people were similarly larger, the rest of the country remained calm. On 28 June 1969, rioting broke out again in Sentul when Malays attacked Indians, and 15 were killed.  Casualties  According to police figures which are disputed, 196 people were killed in the riots.Hwang, p. 72. The official figures gave 143 of the dead as Chinese, 25 Malay, 13 Indian, and 15 others (undetermined), although unofficial figures suggested higher number of Chinese deaths. The police were authorised to bury any dead bodies found or disposed of them any way they could without inquests or inquiries, which made estimation of the number of deaths difficult as many of the dead were disposed of undocumented. Some were reported to have been thrown into the Klang River, and some were believed to have been disposed of in pools in tin mines. A mass burial of the victims was also captured on film at the Sungai Buloh leper colony near Kuala Lumpur. Western diplomatic sources at that time put the toll at close to 600, and John Slimming estimated the number of deaths to be around 800 in the first week by including hundreds who were officially missing, while other observers and correspondents suggested four-figure numbers. According to official figures 439 individuals were also recorded as injured. 753 cases of arson were logged and 211 vehicles were destroyed or severely damaged.  Immediate effects  Immediately after the riot, the government assumed emergency powers and suspended Parliament, which would reconvene again only in 1971. It also suspended the press and established a National Operations Council (NOC).  Declaration of emergency  The government ordered an immediate curfew throughout the state of Selangor. Security forces comprising some 2,000 Royal Malay Regiment soldiers and 3,600 police officers were deployed and took control of the situation. On 14 and 16 May, a state of emergency and accompanying curfew were declared throughout the country. On 15 May, the National Operations Council (NOC) headed by Tun Abdul Razak was established following a Proclamation of Emergency by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia) Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah. Parts of the constitution were also suspended. With Parliament suspended, the NOC became the supreme decision- making body for the next 18 months. State and District Operations Councils took over state and local governments. The NOC implemented security measures to restore law and order in the country, including the establishment of an unarmed Vigilante Corps, a territorial army, and police force battalions. Newspaper publications were suspended on 15 May, but resumed on 18 May, and censorship was then applied on 21 May. Foreign publications were banned, citizens found in possession of foreign news clippings were detained, and foreign reporters were criticised over allegations of racial bias by the army. The restoration of order in the country was gradually achieved. Curfews continued in most parts of the country, but were gradually scaled back. Peace was restored in the affected areas within two months. In February 1971 parliamentary rule was re-established. The Proclamation of Emergency and the act enacted (Emergency Ordinance 1969) however were never revoked.  Official assessment  The NOC released a report on 9 October 1969, and it cited \\"racial politics\\" as the primary cause of the riots, but was reluctant to assign blame to the Malays. It also attributed the cause of the riots in part to both the Malayan Communist Party and secret societies: It however said that the \\"trouble turned out to be a communal clash between the Malays and the Chinese\\" rather than an instance of Communist insurgency. The report also denied rumours of lack of evenhandedness by the security forces in their handling of the crisis. Tunku Abdul Rahman, in a book released two weeks before the report, blamed the opposition parties for the violence, as well as the influence of the Communists, and thought that the incidents were sparked off by Chinese Communist youths. He absolved the majority of the Malays, Chinese and Indians of any responsibility, and considered the Malays who converged in Kuala Lumpur on May 14 to be merely responding to \\"intolerable provocations\\".  Aftermath  The Rukunegara, the de facto Malaysian pledge of allegiance, was a reaction to the riot. The pledge was introduced on 31 August 1970 as a way to foster unity among Malaysians. The Malay nationalist politician Mahathir Mohamad, who was then little-known and lost his seat as an UMNO candidate in the 10 May election, blamed the riot on the government especially the then Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman for being \\"simple- minded\\" and not planning for a prosperous Malaysia where the Malays have a share of the economic stake. The Tunku in turn blamed \\"extremists\\" such as Mahathir for the racial clashes, which led to the expulsion of Mahathir from UMNO. It propelled Mahathir to write his seminal work The Malay Dilemma, in which he posited a solution to Malaysia's racial tensions based on aiding the Malays economically through an affirmative action programme. The affirmative action policies included the New Economic Policy (NEP), and the creation of Kuala Lumpur as a Federal Territory out of Selangor state in 1974, five years later. After the riots, Tunku Abdul Rahman was forced into the background, with the day-to-day running of the country handed to the deputy Prime Minister, Tun Abdul Razak, who was also the director of the National Operations Council. On 22 September 1970 when the Parliament reconvened, the Tunku resigned his position as Prime Minister, and Tun Abdul Razak took over. In an attempt to form a broader coalition, the Barisan Nasional was formed in place of the Alliance Party, with former opposition parties such as Gerakan, PPP, and PAS invited to join the coalition. After the 1969 riot, UMNO also began to restructure the political system to reinforce its power. It advanced its own version of Ketuanan Melayu whereby \\"the politics of this country has been, and must remain for the foreseeable future, native [i.e. Malay] based: that was the secret of our stability and our prosperity and that is a fact of political life which no one can simply wish away.\\" This principle of Ketuanan Melayu had been repeatedly used in successive election by UMNO to galvanise Malay support for the party.

What proved to be a long co-held title, Duke of Portland, was created in 1716 and ceased in 1990 on the death of the ninth Duke, when the Earldom passed to the most senior agnatic (solely male-line) cousin, namely one of the 6th degree. First creation (1633) The title of Earl of Portland was first created for the politician Richard Weston, 1st Baron Weston, in 1633. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1621 to 1628 and Lord High Treasurer from 1628 to 1635, and had already been created Baron Weston of Nayland in the County of Suffolk in 1628. This title was also in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He served as Joint Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire. His son, the third Earl, was killed at the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665. He was unmarried and was succeeded by his uncle, the fourth Earl. He was childless and on his death in 1688 the titles became extinct. Second creation (1689) The title was created for a second time in 1689 in favour of William Bentinck, the Dutch favourite and close advisor of King William III. He was made Baron Cirencester and Viscount Woodstock at the same time he was given the earldom, also in the Peerage of England. The first earl was succeeded in 1709 by his son from his first marriage, Henry, the second Earl of Portland. He represented Southampton and Hampshire in the House of Commons. In 1716, he was created Marquess of Titchfield and Duke of Portland in the Peerage of Great Britain. His grandson, William Cavendish- Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland was a noted politician. He was Prime Minister in 1783 and from 1807 to 1809 and also served as Home Secretary and as Lord President of the Council. In 1801, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Cavendish. Portland was the husband of Lady Dorothy Cavendish, daughter of William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, and was a descendant on his mother's side of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The third Duke was succeeded by his eldest son William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland. The fourth Duke was also a politician and served as Lord Privy Seal in 1827 and as Lord President of the Council from 1827 to 1828. He married Henrietta, daughter of Major-General John Scott in 1795, and assumed by Royal licence the same year the additional surname of Scott in the manner of Cavendish-Bentinck. His eldest son and heir apparent, William Cavendish-Scott- Bentinck, Marquess of Titchfield, represented two constituencies in Parliament but died unmarried in 1824, 15 years before his father. Portland was therefore succeeded by his second son, William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland. The fifth Duke is remembered as a capable architect and engineer but eccentric, who excavated an underground art gallery and library under his estate at Welbeck Abbey. The fifth Duke died unmarried and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland, who was the only son from the first marriage of Lieutenant-General Arthur Cavendish-Bentinck, younger son of Lord Charles Bentinck, the third son of the third Duke. Charles' first son, also named Charles, was a maternal great-grandfather of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1880, the sixth Duke also succeeded his stepmother as second Baron Bolsover. He was a Conservative politician and served as Master of the Horse from 1886 to 1892 and from 1895 to 1905. His eldest son William Cavendish-Bentinck, 7th Duke of Portland was also a Conservative politician and served as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1927 to 1929 and in 1932. The seventh Duke had no sons and was succeeded by his third cousin, Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck, 8th Duke of Portland, a great-grandson of Major-General Lord Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck, fourth son of the third Duke. However, the barony of Bolsover became extinct upon the death of the seventh Duke. The eighth Duke was a colonial administrator in British Kenya and served as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Kenya. The eighth Duke was childless and succeeded by his younger brother, Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, 9th Duke of Portland. He was a diplomat and served as Ambassador to Poland. The ninth Duke's only son, William James Cavendish- Bentinck (1925‚Äì1966), predeceased him, childless, and on Portland's death in 1990 at the age of 93 the marquessate of Titchfield and the dukedom of Portland became extinct. The Duke was succeeded in his remaining titles by his sixth cousin Henry Bentinck, 11th Earl of Portland. He was the great-great- great-great-grandson of William Bentinck, 1st Graf Bentinck (1704‚Äì1774), eldest son of the first Earl from his second marriage, who had been created a Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1732 (with a Royal Licence of 1886 to use the title in England). the titles are held by his only son, the twelfth Earl, born in Australia, who is also Count Bentinck of the Holy Roman Empire. He is an actor known by his professional name Timothy Bentinck. Other members of the Cavendish-Bentinck family Several other members of the Cavendish- Bentinck family have also gained distinction. Lord William Bentinck, second son of the third Duke, was a prominent soldier, politician and colonial administrator. The aforementioned Arthur Cavendish-Bentinck was a lieutenant- general in the British Army. His grandson Lord Henry Cavendish-Bentinck was a Conservative politician. Lord Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck, fourth son of the third Duke, was a major-general in the army and a Tory MP. His only son George Cavendish-Bentinck was a Conservative politician. Lord George Bentinck, fifth son of the fourth Duke, was a Tory politician. John Charles Bentinck, grandson of the Hon. William Bentinck, eldest son from the second marriage of the 1st Earl, was also a major-general in the army. His younger son Sir Henry John William Bentinck was also a noted soldier. Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland, wife of the second Duke, was a wealthy heiress and collector. Seat The seat of the Dukes of Portland was Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire. Welbeck Abbey and its many acres continued in the senior branch of the family (becoming Cavendish-Bentinck) through ancestry of a daughter of the 7th Duke. The mansion was in the early 21st century restored as a family home after many years of institutional use. The Dukes of Portland also owned the village of Pegswood in Northumberland. The traditional burial place of the Dukes of Portland at Welbeck Abbey was the churchyard of St Winifred's Church in the nearby village of Holbeck.

He published 21 books and numerous short stories and features. His humorous works were ranked with Jerome K. Jerome and W. W. Jacobs, his detective stories with Conan Doyle, his politico-science fiction with H. G. Wells and his supernatural stories with Algernon Blackwood. George Orwell acknowledged that Bramah's book, What Might Have Been, influenced his Nineteen Eighty-Four. Bramah created the characters Kai Lung and Max Carrados. Bramah was a very private man who chose not to make public any details of his personal life. He died at the age of 74 in Weston-super- Mare, Somerset. After Bramah had died his widow presented to the Hammersmith borough libraries a collection of all his published books for reference use only. It was in Hammersmith that Bramah had lived for some 30 years, not far from Ravenscourt Park.Letter from the borough librarian in The Times; 1 June 1978 Early career Ernest Brammah Smith (he later changed the spelling of his middle name to Bramah) dropped out of the Manchester Grammar School at sixteen, having been close to the bottom in each subject. He went into farming, first as a farm pupil and then in his own right. He was supported by his father who had risen in a short time from a factory hand to a wealthy man. The farming enterprise cost his father ¬£100,000 in today's money. But it was while farming that he began to contribute local vignettes to the Birmingham News. Later he wrote a tongue-in-cheek book about his adventures in farming. It found few buyers and was remaindered and pulped, though his father agreed to support him while he made his way in Grub Street as a writer. He eventually obtained a position as secretary to Jerome K. Jerome and rose to become editor of one of Jerome's magazines. After leaving Jerome he edited other journals for a publishing firm that later went bankrupt. Writing career Bramah attained commercial and critical success with his creation of Kai Lung, an itinerant storyteller. He first appears in The Wallet of Kai Lung which was rejected by eight publishers before Grant Richards published it in 1900. It was still in print a hundred years later. The Kai Lung stories are humorous tales set in China, often with fantasy elements such as dragons and gods.David Langford, \\"Bramah, Ernest\\" in the Encyclopedia of Fantasy, edited by John Clute and John Grant, 1997, Orbit (pp. 135-36). With Kai Lung, Bramah invented a form of Mandarin English illustrated by the following passages: *\\"Kai Lung rose guardedly to his feet, with many gestures of polite assurance and having bowed several times to indicate his pacific nature, he stood in an attitude of deferential admiration. At this display the elder and less attractive of the maidens fled, uttering loud and continuous cries of apprehension to conceal the direction of her flight\\".Bramah, Ernest (1922). Kai Lung's Golden Hours. London: Grant Richards Ltd., p. 9. *\\"In particular, there is among this august crowd of Mandarins one Wang Yu, who has departed on three previous occasions without bestowing the reward of a single cash. If the feeble and covetous Wang Yu will place in his very ordinary bowl the price of one of his exceedingly ill-made pipes, this unworthy person will proceed.\\"Bramah, Ernest (1900). The Wallet of Kai Lung. London: Grant Richards, p. 124. *\\"After secretly observing the unstudied grace of her movements, the most celebrated picture-maker of the province burned the implements of his craft, and began life anew as a trainer of performing elephants.\\"Bramah (1922), p. 174. The Kai Lung stories are studded with proverbs and aphorisms, such as the following: * \\"He who lacks a single tael sees many bargains\\"Bramah (1922), p. 57. * \\"It is a mark of insincerity of purpose to spend one‚Äôs time in looking for the sacred Emperor in low-class teashops\\"Bramah (1900), p. 6. * \\"It has been said there are few situations in life that cannot be honourably settled, and without loss of time, either by suicide, a bag of gold or by thrusting a despised antagonist over the edge of a precipice on a dark night\\"Bramah (1922), p. 264. Bramah also wrote political science fiction. What Might Have Been, published in 1907 and republished as The Secret of the League in 1909), is an anti-socialist dystopia reflecting Bramah's conservative political views.John Clute, \\"Bramah, Ernest\\", in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction edited by Clute and Peter Nicholls, Orbit, 1993 (pp. 15‚Äì56). It was acknowledged by George Orwell as a source for Nineteen Eighty-Four. Orwell credited it with giving a considerably accurate prediction of the rise of Fascism.George Orwell, \\"Predictions of Fascism\\", originally published in the Tribune on 12 July 1940, appearing in The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell, Volume 2, pp. 47‚Äì48). At a time when the English Channel had yet to be crossed by an aeroplane, Bramah foresaw aerial express trains traveling at 10,000 feet, a nationwide wireless-telegraphy network, a prototype fax machine and a cypher typewriter similar to the German Enigma machine. In 1914, Bramah created Max Carrados, a blind detective. Given the outlandish idea that a blind man could be a detective, in the introduction to the second Carrados book The Eyes of Max Carrados, Bramah compared his hero's achievements to those of real-life blind people such as Nicholas Saunderson, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, Blind Jack of Knaresborough the road builder, John Fielding the Bow Street Magistrate (of whom it was said he could identify 3,000 thieves by their voices), and Helen Keller. \\"Interesting times\\" and other quotations Bramah has been credited with the invention of the saying, widely quoted as an ancient Chinese curse, \\"May you live in interesting times\\", along with \\"May you come to the attention of those in authority\\" and \\"May you find what you are looking for\\". However, these do not appear in the Kai Lung stories.

He trained and worked for much of his life as an apothecary, moving in later life to the university. His shop became the second-largest apothecary in Berlin, and the most productive artisanal chemical research center in Europe. Klaproth was a major systematizer of analytical chemistry, and an independent inventor of gravimetric analysis. His attention to detail and refusal to ignore discrepancies in results led to improvements in the use of apparatus. He was a major figure in understanding the composition of minerals and characterizing the elements. Klaproth discovered uranium (1789) and zirconium (1789). He was also involved in the discovery or co-discovery of titanium (1792), strontium (1793), cerium (1803), and chromium (1797) and confirmed the previous discoveries of tellurium (1798) and beryllium (1798). Klaproth was a member and director of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He was recognized internationally as a member of the Royal Society in London, the Institut de France, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Career Klaproth was born in Wernigerode. He was the son of a tailor, and attended the Latin school at Wernigerode for four years. For much of his life he followed the profession of apothecary. In 1759, when he was 16 years old, he apprenticed at Quedlinburg. In 1764, he became a journeyman. He trained in pharmacies at Quedlinburg (1759‚Äì1766); Hanover (1766‚Äì1768, with August Hermann Brande); Berlin (1768); and Danzig (1770). In 1771, Klaproth returned to Berlin to work for Valentin Rose the Elder as manager of his business. Following Rose's death, Klaproth passed the required examinations to become senior manager. Following his marriage in 1780, he was able to buy his own establishment, the Apotheke zum Baren. Between 1782 and 1800, Klaproth published 84 papers based on researches carried out in the Apotheke's laboratory. His shop was the most productive site of artisanal chemistry investigations in Europe at that time. Beginning in 1782, he was the assessor of pharmacy for the examining board of the Ober-Collegium Medicum. In 1787 Klaproth was appointed lecturer in chemistry to the Prussian Royal Artillery. In 1788, Klaproth became an unsalaried member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. In 1800, he became the salaried director of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He sold the apothecary and moved to the academy, where he convinced the university to build a new laboratory. Upon completion in 1802, Klaproth moved the equipment from his apothecary laboratory into the new building. When the University of Berlin was founded in 1810 he was selected to be the professor of chemistry. He died in Berlin on New Year's Day in 1817. Contributions Memorial plate on the Dorotheenst√§dtischer Friedhof in Berlin, by Ralf Sander. An exact and conscientious worker, Klaproth did much to improve and systematise the processes of analytical chemistry and mineralogy. His appreciation of the value of quantitative methods led him to become one of the earliest adherents of the Lavoisierian doctrines outside France. Klaproth was the first to discover uranium, identifying it first in torbernite but doing the majority of his research on it with the mineral pitchblende. On 24 September 1789 he announced his discovery to the Royal Prussian Academy of sciences in Berlin. He also discovered zirconium in 1789, separating it in the form of its ‚Äòearth‚Äô zirconia, oxide ZrO2. Klaproth analyzed a brightly-colored form of the mineral called \\"hyacinth\\" from Ceylon. He gave the new element the name zirconium based on its Persian name \\"zargun\\", gold-colored. Klaproth characterised uranium and zirconium as distinct elements, though he did not obtain any of them in the pure metallic state. Klaproth independently discovered cerium (1803), a rare earth element, around the same time as J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger, in the winter of 1803. William Gregor of Cornwall was the first to identify the element titanium in 1791, correctly concluding that he had found a new element in the ore ilmenite from the Menachan valley. He proposed the name \\"menachanite\\", but his discovery attracted little attention. Klaproth verified the presence of an oxide of an unknown element in the ore rutile from Hungary in 1795. Klaproth suggested the name \\"titanium\\". It was later determined that menachanite and titanium were the same element, from two different minerals, and Klaproth's name was adopted. Klaproth clarified the composition of numerous substances until then imperfectly known, including compounds of then newly recognised elements tellurium, strontium and chromium. Chromium was discovered in 1797 by Louis Nicolas Vauquelin and independently discovered in 1798 by Klaproth and by Tobias Lowitz, in a mineral from the Ural mountains. Klaproth confirmed chromium's independent status as an element. The existence of tellurium was first suggested in 1783 by Franz-Joseph Mueller von Reichenstein, an Austrian mining engineer who was examining Transylvanian gold samples. Tellurium was also discovered independently by Hungarian P√°l Kitaibel in 1789. Mueller sent some of his mineral to Klaproth in 1796. Klaproth isolated the new substance and confirmed the identification of the new element tellurium in 1798. He credited Mueller as its discoverer, and suggested that the heavy metal be named \\"tellus\\", Latin for 'earth'. In 1790 Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank determined that the mineral strontianite, found near Strontian in Scotland, was different from barium-based minerals. Klapworth was one of several scientists involved in the characterization of strontium compounds and minerals. Klaproth, Thomas Charles Hope, and Richard Kirwan independently studied and reported on the properties of strontianite, the preparation of compounds of strontium, and their differentiation from those of barium. In September 1793, Klaproth published on the separation of strontium from barium, and in 1794 on the preparation of strontium oxide and strontium hydroxide. In 1808, Humphry Davy became the first to successfully isolate the pure element. Louis Nicolas Vauquelin reported the existence of a new element common to emerald and beryl in 1798, and suggested that it be named \\"glucine\\". Klaproth confirmed the presence of a new element, and became involved in a lengthy and ongoing debate over its name by suggesting \\"beryllia\\". The element was first isolated in 1828, independently by Friedrich W√∂hler and Antoine Bussy. Only in 1949 did IUPAC rule exclusively in favor of the name beryllium. Klaproth published extensively, collecting over 200 papers by himself in Beitr√§ge zur chemischen Kenntnis der Mineralk√∂rper (5 vols., 1795‚Äì1810) and Chemische Abhandlungen gemischten Inhalts (1815). He also published a Chemisches W√∂rterbuch (1807‚Äì1810), and edited a revised edition of F. A. C. Gren's Handbuch der Chemie (1806). Klaproth became a foreign member of the Royal Society of London in 1795, and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1804. He also belonged to the Institut de France. The crater Klaproth on the Moon is named after him. His son Julius was a famous orientalist. Works * Beitr√§ge Zur Chemischen Kenntniss Der Mineralk√∂rper . Vol. 1‚Äì5 .

According to Operative Program Regional Development of Bulgaria, the urban area of Haskovo is the seventh largest in Bulgaria and has a population of 184,731 inhabitants. The first settlement found in Haskovo is from circa 5000 BC. Haskovo celebrated its 1,000th anniversary as a town in 1985. To mark the event, a new clock tower was erected in the centre of the town. Haskovo Cove in Greenwich Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, is named after the city of Haskovo. Climate Due to its relative proximity to the Aegean sea the climate in summer is very similar to Mediterranean climate, whilst in winter, especially with the winds coming from the north, the temperatures drop to the level of continental climate. The average yearly temperature is about . Winters are cold but not as snowy as the western and northern parts of the country. Summer in Haskovo begins around mid-May and lasts until October. Etymology Many speculate that the current name came from the Arabic word \\"has\\" (Ÿáÿ≥; possession). Others claim that it comes from the Turkish word \\"has\\", having roots to the meaning \\"clean.\\" The ancient Thracian name of the settlement was Marsa, by which it was known until as late as 1782. By 1830, it was known by its Turkish name, Hask√∂y.Arrowsmith, John. Turkey in Europe. 1832. The Bulgarian (and common Slavic) placename suffix \\"-ovo\\" replaced the Turkish \\"k√∂y\\" after the city switched to Bulgarian from Ottoman rule. History According to the archeologists, the area of Haskovo was originally settled about seven thousand years ago. In and around Haskovo, evidence has been preserved that confirms its long history during the prehistoric, Thracian, Greek, Roman, and Byzantine periods. In the 9th century ‚Äì during the First Bulgarian Empire ‚Äì a fortress was built in Haskovo that soon was transformed into a town. The town was located at the centre of a sizable region between the Klokotnitsa, Harmanliyska, and Maritsa rivers. In medieval times it was known for the nearby Uzundzhovo fair, famous in all of Bulgaria. After the liberation from Ottoman rule in 1878, the Haskovo region became popular for high-quality tobacco production. However, presently there is no cigarette production in the region as the once big Tobacco company \\"Haskovo-BT\\" was closed in 2005.HighBeam Currently, the biggest enterprises produce food, machinery, and textiles.  Population  The population of Haskovo was 14,191 in 1887. Since then it started growing decade by decade, mostly because of the migrants from the rural areas and the surrounding smaller towns. It reached its peak in the period 1987‚Äì1991, when the population exceeded 90,000. In December 2017, Haskovo's population was 71,214 people within the city limits. The Haskovo Municipality, with the legally affiliated adjacent villages, had a population of 87,780.National Statistical Institute - 2012 Ethnic and religious composition According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows: Population on 01.02.2011 by provinces, municipalities, settlements and age; National Statistical InstitutePopulation by province, municipality, settlement and ethnic identification, by 01.02.2011; Bulgarian National Statistical Institute *Bulgarians: 54,869 (79.3%) *Turks: 12,507 (18.1%) *Roma: 691 (1.0%) *Others: 400 (0.8%) *Indefinable: 709 (0.7%) * Undeclared: 7,221 (9.5%) Total: 76,397 In Haskovo Municipality 63,963 declared as Bulgarians, 16,890 as Turks, 3859 as Roma and 8,984 did not declare their ethnic group. Most of the 28,444 Turks (12.5%) in Haskovo Province are concentrated within the city and the municipality, while the Bulgarians have a higher proportion in the province than the city, numbering 180,541 (79.4%). According to the 2001 census, the Orthodox Christians are around 80% vs. around 20% Muslims. Culture Ivan Dimov Drama Theatre (est. 1921) Monument of the Holy Mother of God, the world's highest monument of the Virgin Mary The most notable cultural landmarks in Haskovo are the newly renovated Ivan Dimov drama theater, the Museum of History, and an art gallery. The annual Colourful Thrace Sings and Dances folk festival takes place in the nearby park Kenana. A 32-metre-high monument of the Mother of God and the Infant Jesus was erected on the Hill of Youth near Haskovo in 2003. The monument was inaugurated on 8 September on the occasion of the Nativity of Holy Virgin Mary, when the day of the town of Haskovo is celebrated. It was entered into the Guinness Book of Records as the highest monument to the Mother of God in the world. Haskovo has recently invested in renovating its town center, with a variety of new sculptures and fountains erected. Municipal landmarks include the Thracian Aleksandrovo tomb as well as Uzundzhovo's Church of the Assumption, built originally as a mosque during Ottoman times. In 1395 the Eski cami (the Old Mosque) was built as one of the first in the Balkans. Its minaret is slightly inclined.

A freeway throughout its entire length, it officially runs from Vermont Avenue in Gardena, just west of the junction with the Harbor Freeway (Interstate 110, I-110), east to Riverside at the junction with the Pomona (SR 60 west of SR 91) and Moreno Valley (SR 60 and I-215 east of SR 91) freeways. Though signs along the portion from Vermont Avenue west to Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) in Hermosa Beach along Artesia Boulevard are still signed as SR 91, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) no longer controls this portion of the highway, as this segment was relinquished to local jurisdictions in 2003. SR 91 inherited its route number from the mostly decommissioned U.S. Route 91 (US 91), which passed through the Inland Empire in a northeasterly direction on its way to Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and points beyond. Those segments of US 91 are now parallel to, or have been replaced altogether by, I-15. Route description From the Harbor Freeway to its interchange with the Long Beach Freeway (I-710) in northern Long Beach, SR 91 is named the Gardena Freeway. Between the Long Beach Freeway and its interchange with the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) in Buena Park, it is named the Artesia Freeway. From the Santa Ana Freeway to its eastern terminus at the interchange of the Pomona, Moreno Valley, and Escondido Freeways, it is named the Riverside Freeway. Control cities on SR 91 vary by location. Heading westbound, between SR 60/I-215 and the Orange County line, the control city is Beach Cities. With SR 241 heading towards Irvine, Laguna Beach, and the rest of south Orange County, the control city becomes Los Angeles between the Orange‚ÄìRiverside county line and I-5. I-5 directs travelers to Los Angeles so between I-5 and Pioneer Boulevard, the control city is Artesia. Between Pioneer Boulevard and SR 1, the control city becomes Beach Cities again. Heading eastbound, the control city for the entire route is Riverside. The Beach Cities control city may have to do with SR 91's former western terminus in Hermosa Beach. SR 91 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 91 is part of the State Scenic Highway System from SR 55 to the east city limit of Anaheim, in the western part of the Santa Ana Canyon, and is eligible for the system through the canyon to Interstate 15. Gardena Freeway The Gardena Freeway is a freeway in southern Los Angeles County. It is the westernmost freeway portion of State Route 91. It begins just west of the Harbor Freeway at the intersection with Vermont Avenue in the eastern edge of the city of Gardena, proceeding eastward approximately six miles (10 km) until it intersects the Long Beach Freeway. Thereafter, SR 91 is known as the Artesia Freeway. Until 1991, the Gardena Freeway was known as the Redondo Beach Freeway. The name change reflected the successful efforts of the cities of Torrance and Redondo Beach to block the extension of the freeway westward to its intended terminus at the cancelled Pacific Coast Freeway in Redondo Beach. In 1997, the California government dedicated the portion of SR 91 between Alameda Street and Central Avenue to former assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. Artesia Freeway The Artesia Freeway is a freeway in southeastern Los Angeles County and northwestern Orange County. It runs east‚Äìwest from its western terminus at the Long Beach Freeway in northern Long Beach to its eastern terminus at the Santa Ana Freeway in Buena Park. (SR 91 continues west of the Long Beach Freeway as the Gardena Freeway, and east of the Santa Ana Freeway as the Riverside Freeway.) The \\"Artesia Freeway\\" name originally was assigned to the entire length of SR 91 west of the Santa Ana Freeway in the early 1970s since it was, in sense, the freeway realignment of SR 91 from the paralleling Artesia Boulevard. During the 1984 Summer Olympics, a stretch of the highway was home to the cycling men's road team time trial event. As the only freeway to link Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties, SR 91 is one of the most heavily congested routes in Southern California. Riverside Freeway SR 71. This image was taken before the toll lane extension that was completed in 2017. Eastbound SR 91 at SR 55 (right) and 91 Express Lanes (left). The \\"button style\\" sign on the left was replaced with a \\"FASTRAK ONLY\\" sign in 2017. SR 57 Between the Santa Ana Freeway, Interstate 5 (I-5), in Buena Park and the 91 Freeway's eastern terminus at a junction with Interstate 215 and State Route 60 in Riverside, the 91 Freeway's assigned name is the Riverside Freeway. Past the I-215/SR 60/SR 91 junction, the Riverside Freeway continues as I-215. A weigh station is available between the Imperial Highway and Yorba Linda Boulevard/Weir Canyon Road exits. In 2003, Caltrans permanently closed off the Coal Canyon Road westbound and eastbound exits and entrances for environmental purposes; however, there are still traces of unmaintained road where the former exit lay, showing evidence that the ramps still exist, available to use as runaway ramps or emergency stops. In 2015, Caltrans permanently closed off the Grand Boulevard eastbound exit and westbound entrance to accommodate the widening of the freeway. If the ramps had stayed open, more businesses and houses would have been demolished. The ramps were scrapped with the widening and there is no emergency exit. The Riverside Freeway first opened in 1963 signed as U.S. Route 91 and U.S. Route 395 and the last section was built in 1975. 91 Express Lanes The 91 Express Lanes are high-occupancy toll lanes contained entirely within the median of the Riverside Freeway in Orange and Riverside counties. The 91 Express Lanes run from the junction of SR 91 with the SR 55 Freeway (Costa Mesa Freeway) in Anaheim to its junction with I-15 in Corona. Before the extension in 2017, they ended at the Riverside County line. With the extension of the toll lanes, the HOV lane between I-15 and Green River Road was removed. The primary purpose of the toll lanes is to provide a faster output for drivers due to the congestion the highway experiences during peak hours. The toll lanes opened in 1995 and when they opened, they had the first fully-automated toll collection system in the world. The 91 Express Lanes consist of two primary lanes in each direction, separated from the main lanes of the Riverside Freeway with white, , plastic lane markers (as opposed to concrete barriers or a similar solid barrier). Entry to and exit from the 91 Express Lanes is provided only at their west and east ends, but there is one exit at the Orange‚ÄìRiverside county line, near Green River Road (where the toll road originally terminated before 2017), for drivers who want to exit the toll lanes. Each direction also has an additional high-occupancy vehicle lane, called the \\"3+ Carpool Lane\\", that can only be used by motorcycles, zero emission vehicles, and vehicles with three or more persons inside. Vehicles using the \\"3+ Carpool Lane\\" are not charged a toll, except when traveling eastbound from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm on weekdays. During that period, they are charged 50% of the full posted toll. Although use of the \\"3+\\" lanes is free of charge, a FasTrak transponder is required on all vehicles using the 91 Express Lanes, including the \\"3+\\" lanes; otherwise, vehicles without the transponder are subject to fines. All tolls are collected using an open road tolling system, with each vehicle required to carry a FasTrak transponder; therefore, there are no toll booths to receive cash. The 91 Express Lanes use a variable pricing system based on the time of day. The road is not truly congestion priced because toll rates come from a preset schedule and are not based on actual congestion. Since May 22, 2017, the highest toll rate on the tollway, charged 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm eastbound on Fridays, is $20.85 to travel the entire length of , or approximately . The highest toll in the morning rush hour, charged 7:00 am to 7:59 am westbound Monday to Thursday, is $11.75. A toll policy is published which states the criteria where tolls will be raised. The policy is designed to \\"a) reduce the likelihood of congestion by diverting traffic to other hours with available capacity; b) maintain free flow travel speed in the 91 Express Lanes; c) maintain travel time savings; d) accommodate projected growth in travel demand and; e) ensure that the toll road generates sufficient revenue to effectively operate the toll lanes and maintain a strong debt service position.\\" Changes to the toll schedule require ten days notification to the public and the OCTA board. Once tolls are changed during the super peak period, they may not be changed again for six months. All tolls increase annually due to inflation. Despite this, the toll lanes are generally free flowing during most peak hour conditions. History=Original US 91: Barstow to Nevada The Arrowhead Trail, an auto trail connecting Salt Lake City with Los Angeles, initially took a longer route via present US 95 and former US 66 between Las Vegas and Needles, as the more direct Old Spanish Trail was in very poor condition. The \\"Silver Lake cutoff\\", which would save about 90 miles (145 km), p. 11 was proposed by 1920, and completed in 1925 as an oiled road by San Bernardino County. The Bureau of Public Roads and the state of Nevada both urged its inclusion in the state highway system, the former as part of the federal aid highway connecting Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, and the state legislature did that in 1925, with it becoming an extension of Route 31. (Across the state line, State Route 6 continued through Las Vegas to Arizona.) The initial plan for the U.S. Highway system simply stated that Route No. 91 would run from Las Vegas \\"to an intersection with Route No. 60\\" (which became US 66 in 1926), but in 1926 the cutoff was chosen, ending at US 66 at Daggett, just east of Barstow. (The roadway south from Las Vegas later became part of US 95.) The route was added to the federal-aid secondary system in 1926, which helped pay for a mid-1930s widening and paving, including some realignments (parts of the old road are now known as Arrowhead Trail). The new routing generally followed the present I-15, except through Baker (where it used Baker Boulevard) and into Barstow (where it followed former SR 58 to First Avenue, ending at Main Street, which carried US 66). SR 18: former extension of US 91 through Santa Ana Canyon to Long Beach US 91 was extended southwest to Long Beach in the late 1940s. Beginning at Barstow, the extension overlapped US 66 over Cajon Pass to San Bernardino. From San Bernardino west through Riverside and Santa Ana Canyon to Olive, the state took over a mostly paved county highway in 1931 as part of an extension of Route 43 to Newport Beach via Santa Ana. \\"State Highway Route 43, Waterman canyon via Santa Ana canyon to Newport Beach.\\" Two branches leading west from Route 43 near Olive along mostly constructed county roads were added in 1933: Route 175 along Orangethorpe Avenue and Artesia Boulevard from near the mouth of the canyon west to Route 60 (now SR 1) in Hermosa Beach (unconstructed through Compton until the mid-1950sNational Bridge Inventory database, 2006: the bridge over Compton Creek and Alameda Street is dated 1956.), and Route 178 along Lincoln Avenue and Carson Street from Olive west to Route 168 (now SR 19) in Lakewood. \\"State Highway Route 60 near Hermosa Beach to State Highway Route 43 in Santa Ana Canyon via Artesia Avenue.\\" \\"Cerritos Avenue to State Highway Route 43 near Olive via Anaheim.\\" \\"Route 31 is from: (a) San Bernardino to the Nevada State line near Calada, via Barstow. (b) Route 26 near Colton to Route 9 near San Bernardino via Mt. Vernon Avenue.\\" \\"Route 43 is from Newport Beach to Route 31 at Victorville, via Santa Ana Canyon, San Bernardino, Waterman Canyon, \\"Crest Drive\\" into Bear Valley, Big Bear Lake and Baldwin Lake. Route 43 includes a highway around Big Bear Lake.\\" \\"Route 175 is from Route 60 near Hermosa Beach to Route 43 in Santa Ana Canyon via Artesia Avenue.\\" \\"Route 178 is from Cerritos Avenue to Route 43 near Olive via Anaheim.\\" When state routes were marked in 1934, Route 175 became Sign Route 14, and Sign Route 18 included all of Route 178 and most of Route 43 into the San Bernardino Mountains. When US 91 was extended to Long Beach, it overlapped SR 18 from San Bernardino to Lakewood, where it turned south along SR 19 to the Los Alamitos Traffic Circle. There it turned west along US 101 Alternate to near downtown Long Beach, where it ended at SR 15 (Atlantic Avenue), at a terminus shared with US 6. (This routing along SR 19 and US 101 Alt. also became an extension of SR 18.) In 1935, the state improved the alignment between Fairmont Boulevard and Gypsum Canyon Road, including a bypass of the old road, which curved along the south slope of the canyon, east of Weir Canyon Road. In the late 1930s, the Prado Dam project resulted in the bypassing of a longer section, replacing Prado Road, an abandoned road curving to the east end of the dam, Pomona Rincon Road, Auto Center Drive, Pomona Road, and Yorba Street with the present Green River Road, Palisades Drive, part of SR 91, and 6th Street. \\"routes usually traveled\\" as of 1941 \\"routes usually traveled\\" as of 1941 SR 14: present SR 91 to Hermosa Beach Before the present freeway was constructed, SR 14 ran along Gould Avenue, Redondo Beach Boulevard, Compton Boulevard, Alameda Street, Artesia Avenue, La Habra Boulevard, Firestone Boulevard and Orangethorpe Avenue. In the 1964 renumbering, SR 14 was renumbered to SR 91\\\\. Prior to 1991, the Gardena Freeway was known as the Redondo Beach Freeway, referring to Caltrans's original intention for the freeway portion of the route to continue all the way to the never-built Pacific Coast Freeway. Before 1997, Caltrans controlled maintenance of SR 91 up to State Route 1 in Hermosa Beach. The portion between Vermont Avenue and Western Avenue was relinquished to Gardena in 1997. In 2003, the western portion, from SR 1 to Western Avenue, was relinquished to the cities that the road goes through. The first segment of the freeway was built in 1965 as US 91, and the last segment was built in 1975. Despite the relinquishments, however, Artesia Boulevard between I-110 and SR 1 is still signed off as SR 91\\\\. Construction of the 91 Express Lanes Due to rapid population growth and the decline in the availability of affordable housing closer to job centers in Orange County, new residential development began in earnest in western Riverside County from the 1980s through today. This development is occurring in or around existing cities such as Riverside, Corona, Moreno Valley, Lake Elsinore, Murrieta, and Temecula. This development also led to the incorporation of the cities of Wildomar, Menifee, Eastvale, and Jurupa Valley. As there are very few direct routes between Orange and Riverside counties because of the Santa Ana Mountains that separate them, the Riverside Freeway is subject to high traffic volumes, composed primarily of commuters traveling between their jobs in Orange County and their homes in Riverside County (often referred to by traffic reporters as \\"The Corona Crawl\\"). Typical peak period delays were 30‚Äì40 minutes in each direction in the ten miles (16 km) of the tollway before construction. Westbound Artesia Freeway (SR 91) at the interchange with the Long Beach Freeway (I-710) Solutions to the traffic problem were limited. The chosen solution was to create a toll road in the median of the freeway. This original section of the 91 Express Lanes operated between the Costa Mesa Freeway (SR 55) interchange in eastern Anaheim and the Orange‚ÄìRiverside county line, a distance of about . The project was developed in partnership with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) by California Private Transportation Company (CPTC), which formally transferred ownership of the facility to the State of California prior to opening the project to traffic on December 27, 1995. Caltrans then leased the toll road back to CPTC for a 35-year operating period. The new lanes have been officially designated a part of the state highway system. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) is responsible for providing police services at CPTC's expense. Maintenance and operational costs for the facility are also the responsibility of CPTC. In April 2002, the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) reached an agreement in concept to purchase the private toll road project for $207.5 million. The OCTA took possession of the toll road on January 3, 2003, marking the first time the 91 Express Lanes was managed by public officials. Within a few months, OCTA turned the lanes into the HOT / tollway hybrid that it is today. One of the primary investors in CPTC, Cofiroute USA, continues to manage and operate the lanes under a management contract with OCTA. Opening in 1995, the 91 Express Lanes was the first privately funded tollway built in the United States since the 1940s, and the first fully automated tollway in the world. The express lanes have been controversial because of a non-compete agreement that the state made with CPTC. The clause, which was negotiated by Caltrans and never was brought to the legislature, prevented any improvements along of the Riverside Freeway to ensure profit for the express lanes. This includes restricting the state from widening the free lanes or building mass transit near the freeway. CPTC filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over freeway widening related to the interchange with the Eastern Transportation Corridor, which was dismissed once the purchase with OCTA was finalized. Following the settlement, an additional lane was added for a segment eastbound from SR 241 to SR 71. However, as a result of the controversy, more toll road advocates favor creating local agencies similar to transportation corridor agencies to build and maintain future tollways. New toll roads would be financed with tax- exempt bonds on a stand-alone basis, meaning that taxpayers would not be responsible for repaying any debt if toll revenues fall short. Also, there would be a less restrictive non-compete clause: they would be compensated only for any revenue loss caused by improvements near the toll roads. In the mid-2010s, the Riverside County Transportation Commission extended the 91 Express Lanes east from their previous terminus at the Orange‚ÄìRiverside county line to the I-15 interchange in Corona; this extension opened to traffic on March 20, 2017. Both Orange and Riverside County transportation agencies co- manage the 91 Express Lanes. Future In 2005, evaluations were made about the feasibility of constructing two tunnels through the Santa Ana Mountains which could carry 72,000 cars per day and allow for a commuter rail service between Corona and Irvine. The financial and technical evaluations found that in the current financial environment, building the tunnels would not be financially or technologically feasible. Additional study of the Irvine Corona Expressway tunnel project has been deferred until such time as financial considerations improve and/or technological advancements warrant reexamination. If built, the Irvine-Corona Expressway would follow a similar route to the 91 Freeway and is designed to reduce the growing traffic congestion on SR 91 that prompted the construction of the 91 Express Lanes. If completed, the Irvine-Corona Expressway is projected to be the longest traffic tunnel in North America, approximately . One tunnel would be a reversible two- lane freeway for autos and trucks, the direction reversed based on time of day. It would carry westbound traffic in the morning hours, and eastbound traffic during the afternoon and early evening hours. The second tunnel would be slated exclusively for light rail commuter train service. The proposed tunnels are opposed by environmental groups, cities in Orange County near the terminus of the proposed road, and by the Irvine Company, which believes that the tunnel is not necessary and distracts from short-term solutions such as freeway widening. Numerous other projects by the Orange County Transportation Authority are currently underway or in the planning phases for distant completion, some as far out as the year 2030.

It is also the capital of the Shughnon District of Gorno- Badakhshan. It has a population of 30,500 (2020 estim.). Khorugh is above sea level in the Pamir Mountains (ancient Mount Imeon) at the confluence of the rivers Gunt and Panj. The city is bounded to the south (Nivodak) and to the north (Tem) by the deltas of the Shakhdara and Gunt, respectively. The two rivers merge in the eastern part of the city flow through the city, dividing it almost evenly until its delta in the Panj, on the border with Afghanistan. Khorugh is known for its poplar trees that dominate the flora of the city. History Typical scenery in the area Until the late 19th century, Khorugh was in an area disputed between the Emir of Bukhara, Shah of Afghanistan, Russia and Britain. The Russians emerged the winners of the region after The Great Game, which fixed the current northern border of Afghanistan on the Panj River and established the territory of Russian Pamir around Khorugh. Before 1896, when the Russians arrived and built a fort, the main town in the area was Kala-i Bar Panj (or Bar Panja Qal'a) somewhat downriver on the Afghan side. Following the fall of czarist Russia and the rise of the Soviet Union, Khorugh became the capital of Gorno-Badakhshan in 1925. Soviet leaders encouraged the migration of settlers to the area with promises of pay, medals and automobiles, but with no industry and little arable land, the effort was not successful. Khorugh occupied headlines in July 2012 due to a government forces clash with guerrillas. Over 40 people, including 12 soldiers were killed (many reports indicated that the number of casualties could be higher). The country‚Äôs security forces moved in to arrest suspects in the murder of secret services General Abdullo Nazarov. The alleged criminals were linked to former guerrilla leader-turned-border patrol commander Tolib Ayombekov. Ayombekov is alleged to have been involved in drug trafficking and the smuggling of tobacco and precious stones for many years. Facilities and Education Modern Khorugh is one of the poorest areas of Tajikistan, with the charitable organization Aga Khan Foundation providing almost the only source of cash income. However, the city does have its own university (Khorugh State University), founded in 1992), twelve schools, and several hospitals. There is a museum, the Khorog Regional Museum, an Ismaili Centre, and the second- highest botanical garden in the world, the Pamir Botanical Garden. Along the Dushanbe‚ÄìKhorugh highway Khorugh is also host to the Aga Khan Lyc√©e, one of three campuses of the University of Central Asia (UCA). The University was founded in 2000 by the governments of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, and The Aga Khan. It is the world‚Äôs first internationally chartered institution of higher education. The UCA currently operates a School of Professional and Continuing Education(SPCE), with a School of Arts and Sciences and a Graduate School of Development in the process of being established. The Khorog Campus offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in Economics and Earth and Environmental Sciences. Transportation There is a bridge to the Afghan side of the river. Khorugh is situated along the Pamir Highway at the point where it leaves the Panj valley and heads east up the Gunt valley. The Pamir highway is the main road in Gorno-Badakhshan and connects the Tajik capital of Dushanbe toward the west to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to the northeast. The highway is very difficult to pass in both directions, especially during winter and spring. Khorugh also has a small airport, which can accommodate small capacity airplanes like AN-28 turboprop and the Yakovlev YAK-40 or helicopters. Climate Khorugh experiences a semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSk) with cold, relatively wet winters and hot, dry summers. Sports Khorugh is the locality of highest altitude where bandy has been played.

The prime minister presided over the Council of Ministers, the highest executive body of state, from 1981 until it was renamed to Government in the 1992 constitution. The office of prime minister was renamed in the 1980 constitution to that of Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Pham Van Dong, the second Prime Minister of Vietnam, served as North Vietnamese Prime Minister from 1955 until 1976, when he became prime minister of a unified Vietnam, and then until 1987, when he resigned. At his resignation, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Vietnamese history, and the oldest serving prime minister in the world. He often lamented that he was one of the world's weakest prime ministers, on one occasion saying; \\"I can do nothing. When I say something, nobody listens. If I propose changing a deputy minister, it turns out to be impossible. I cannot even choose my own ministers.\\" Since the death of Pham Hung in 1988, the prime minister has been ranked Number 3 in the order of precedence of the Communist Party's Politburo. Duties, powers and responsibilities The National Assembly by a proposal of the President of Vietnam elects the prime minister. The prime minister is responsible to the National Assembly, and the Assembly elects all ministers to government. Activity reports by the prime minister must be given to the National Assembly, while the Standing Committee of the National Assembly supervises the activities of the Central Government and the prime minister. Finally, the deputies of the National Assembly have the right to question the prime minister and other members of government. The prime minister is the only member of government who must be a member of the National Assembly. This is because the prime minister is accountable to the National Assembly, and he reports to it, or to its Standing Committee, and to the president. The prime minister issues directives and supervises the implementation of formal orders given by the president, the National Assembly or the Standing Committee. Cabinet members and members of the Central Government in general are responsible to the prime minister and the National Assembly for the fields they specialise in. According to the Constitution of Vietnam, the following are the duties, powers and responsibilities of the prime minister: * To head the Central Government, and direct the works of members of the Central Government, the People's Councils at all levels and to chair the meetings of the Cabinet; * To propose to the National Assembly that ministries, or organs with ministerial rank, be established or dissolved; to present to the National Assembly or, when the latter is not in session, to its Standing Committee, for approval, proposals on the appointment, release from duty, or dismissal of deputy prime ministers, cabinet ministers and other members of the Government; * To appoint, release from duty, or dismiss deputy ministers and officials of equal rank; to approve the election, release from duty, secondment and dismissal of chairmen and deputy chairmen of People's Committees of provinces and cities under direct central rule; * To suspend or annul decisions, directives and circulars of cabinet ministers and other Government members, decisions and directives of People's Councils and chairmen of People's Committees of provinces and cities under direct central rule that contravene the Constitution, the law, or other formal written documents of superior State organs; * To suspend the execution of resolutions of People's Councils of provinces and cities under direct central rule that contravene the Constitution, the law, or the formal written orders of superior State organs; at the same time to propose to the Standing Committee of the National Assembly to annul them; * To make regular reports to the people through the mass media on major issues to be settled by the Government. * When the prime minister is absent, he must choose one of his deputy prime ministers to direct the work of the government. The prime minister serves concurrently as the secretary of the CPV Government Caucus Commission. The National Assembly chairman serves as the commission's deputy. Currently there are ten members of the Commission, all of whom hold government posts. Commission members are appointed by the Politburo, and the Commission itself is responsible to the Politburo and the Secretariat. The decision-making process within the Commission is based on the principles of collective leadership.

It is situated between Wimbledon, Morden, South Wimbledon and Wimbledon Chase. It is 7.3 miles (11.7 km) southwest of Charing Cross. The area is part of the historic parish of Merton in Surrey. History :For earlier history see Merton (historic parish) Until the last quarter of the 19th century, the parish of Merton was mainly rural. The area now known as Merton Park was farm land owned by City merchant John Innes who was the local \\"lord of the manor\\". The rapid development of Wimbledon to the north encouraged Innes to develop his land for housing. He took as his model the garden suburbs (particularly Bedford Park in Chiswick) and developed the tree-lined roads of detached and semi-detached houses for which the area is known. The northern section of Merton Park each side of Kingston Road (A238) is now a conservation area. The southern section, roughly from Circle Gardens southwards, was developed in the 1920s and 1930s, stimulated by the opening of the London Underground station at Morden. Housing here was developed on a smaller scale and is not as distinguished, nor is the area designated for conservation. Geography The approximate boundaries of the Merton Park area can be considered to be Kingston Road (A238) to the north, Dorset Road (B285) and Morden Road (A24) to the east, Martin Way to the south and Cannon Hill Lane to the west. Additionally, the area north of Kingston Road between Merton Hall Road, Avebury Road and Kingswood Road is often included. This definition of the area does not correspond directly with the Local Government ward of the same name which for administrative convenience includes areas as far south as Morden South railway station. The area contains two state schools: Merton Park Primary and Rutlish School (boys) and is almost entirely residential in character without shops or pubs except a bar at the Old Rutlishians ('Old Ruts') playing field and clubhouse in Poplar Road. The area's public transport consists mostly of buses with its only train station being South Merton Railway Station. The Tramlink stop for Merton Park, Merton Park tram stop is not actually situated inside the area. The area is not served by the London Underground however it is close to the stations of, Wimbledon (District line), Morden (Northern line) and South Wimbledon (Northern line). The area is centred on the historic parish church, St Mary's. The church was founded in the 12th century by the Augustinian order of the nearby Merton Priory of which only the Western Gate remains. Parks in the area include: * John Innes Park & Recreation Ground * Mostyn Gardens * Kendor Gardens * Church Lane Playing fields Notable people John Dimmer, recipient of the Victoria Cross in 1914, lived here. In the arts, folk singer Sandy Denny was born here. Ronnie Wood from the Rolling Stones lived on Mostyn Road with his wife Jo and their children after they moved back to the UK from America in 1986. They left the area in 1991.

The principal species are C. aestivalis, the eastern mayhaw, and C. opaca, the western mayhaw. Mayhaws grow in moist soil in river and creek bottoms under hardwood trees. The fruit ripens in late April through May, thus the name may-haw. The fruit is also found in bayous surrounding lakes, such as Caddo Lake on the Texas/Louisiana border. Mayhaws are often collected out of the water from boats, and the fruit is used to make jelly. Families would go on outings to collect mayhaws and create stockpiles of the jelly to last throughout the year, but the tradition has declined with the increasing urbanization of the South and the destruction of the mayhaw's native habitat.

Life=Early career His parents were Helen Skirving Mowbray and the Rev. Ridley Haim Herschell, who was a native of Strzelno, in Prussian Poland. When Ridley was a young man, he converted from Judaism to Christianity and took a leading part in founding the British Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Among the Jews. He eventually settled down to the charge of a Nonconformist chapel near the Edgware Road, in London, where he ministered to a large congregation. Farrer was educated at a private school and at University College London. In 1857 he took his BA degree at University College London, University of London. He was regarded as the best speaker at the University College London Union Debating Society. Herschell's reputation persisted after he became a law student at Lincoln's Inn. In 1858 he entered the chambers of Thomas Chitty, the famous special pleader. His fellow pupils included Archibald Levin Smith, subsequently Master of the Rolls, and Arthur Charles who became a judge of the Queen's Bench. He subsequently read with James Hannen, who went on to become Lord Hannen. His fellow pupils gave him the sobriquet \\"Chief Baron\\" because of his air of superiority. In 1860 he was called to the bar and joined the northern circuit. For four or five years he did not obtain much work. He was financially secure, however. Herschell soon made himself useful to Edward James, the then leader of the northern circuit, and to John Richard Quain, the leading stuffgownsman. For the latter he noted briefs and drafted legal opinions. When, in 1866, Quain took silk, Herschell inherited much of his junior practice. Into politics In 1872, Herschell took silk. By 1874, his business had become so good that he turned his thoughts to politics and election to Parliament. In February of that year there was a general election, with the result that the Conservative Party came into power with a parliamentary majority of fifty. The two Radicals, Thomas Charles Thompson and John Henderson who had been returned for City of Durham were unseated, and an attack was then made on the seats of two other Radicals, Isaac Lowthian Bell and Charles Mark Palmer who had been returned for North Durham. Herschell was briefed for one of the latter. He made such an impression on the local Radical leaders that they asked him to stand for City of Durham. After two weeks' electioneering, he was elected as junior member. Between 1874 and 1880, Herschell was assiduous in his attendance of the House of Commons. He was not a frequent speaker, but his few efforts garnered him a favourable reputation as a debater. On one occasion, he carried a resolution in favour of abolishing actions for breach of promise of marriage except when actual pecuniary loss had ensued, the damages in such cases to be measured by the amount of such loss. He was noticed by Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, who in 1880 appointed Herschell Solicitor General. Solicitor General Herschell was knighted within weeks of his appointment as Solicitor General, a position he was to hold until 1885. He drafted multiple bills, most notably the Irish Land Act of 1881, the Corrupt Practices and Bankruptcy Acts of 1883, the County Franchise Act of 1884 and the Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885. This last one halved the representation of Durham City, thus requiring him to quit his seat. Betting on the local support of the Cavendish family, he contested the North Lonsdale division of Lancashire, but in spite of the powerful influence of Lord Hartington, he was badly beaten at the poll. Gladstone, however, again obtained a majority in parliament. Herschell felt the Solicitor General's post slipping away from him, and along with it all prospects of promotion. Lord Selborne and Sir Henry James, however, successively declined Gladstone's offer of the Woolsack, and in 1886 Herschell suddenly found himself Lord Chancellor. He was also given the honorary post of Captain of Deal Castle in 1890. Lord Chancellor Lord Herschell as Lord Chancellor, by Hubert von Herkomer. Herschell's chancellorship lasted barely six months, because in June 1886 Gladstone's Home Rule Bill was rejected in the Commons and his administration fell. In August 1892, when Gladstone returned to power, Herschell again became Lord Chancellor. As a result, he was sworn of the Privy Council that year. In May 1893, he was appointed to the Order of the Bath as a Knight Grand Cross (GCB). In September 1893, when the second Home Rule BiIl came on for second reading in the House of Lords, Herschell took advantage of the opportunity to justify his own 1885 sudden conversion to Home Rule, and that of his colleagues, by comparing it to the Duke of Wellington's conversion to Catholic Emancipation in 1829 and to that of Sir Robert Peel to Free Trade in 1846. In 1895, however, his second chancellorship came to an end with the defeat of the Rosebery ministry. He was perhaps seen at his judicial best in Vagliano v. Bank of England (1891) and Allen v. Flood (1898). Latterly he showed a tendency to interrupt counsel overmuch. The latter case is an example of this. The question involved was what constituted a \\"molestation of a man in the pursuit of his lawful calling\\". At the close of the argument of counsel, whom he had frequently interrupted, one of their lordships observed that although there might be a doubt as to what amounted to such molestation in point of law, the House could well understand, after that day's proceedings, what it was in actual practice. Other public service In addition to his political and judicial work, Herschell rendered many public services. He became a Deputy Lieutenant of the County Palatine of Durham in 1885. and of the County of Kent in 1890. In 1888 he presided over an inquiry directed by the House of Commons, with regard to the Metropolitan Board of Works. He acted as chairman of two royal commissions, one on Indian currency, the other on vaccination. He took a great interest in the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, not only promoting the acts of 1889 and 1894, but also in sifting the truth of allegations which had been brought against the management of that society. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January 1892. In June 1893 he was appointed chancellor of the University of London succeeding the Earl of Derby. His views of reform, according to Victor Dickins, the accomplished registrar of the University, were liberal and frankly stated, though at first they were not altogether popular. He disarmed opposition by his intellectual power, rather than conciliated it by compromise, and sometimes was perhaps a little forceful in his approach various matters of controversy. His characteristic power of detachment was well illustrated by his treatment of the proposal to remove the university to the site of the Imperial Institute at South Kensington. Although he was then chairman of the Institute, the most irreconcilable opponent of the removal never questioned his absolute impartiality. Herschell had been officially connected with the Imperial Institute from its inception. He was chairman of the provisional committee appointed by Edward Prince of Wales to formulate a scheme for its organisation, and he took an active part in the preparation of its royal charter and constitution in conjunction with Lord Thring, Lord James, Sir Frederick Abel and John Hollams. He was the first chairman of its council, and, except during his tour in India in 1888, when he brought the Institute to the notice of the Indian authorities, he was hardly absent from a single meeting. For his special services in this connection he received the Order of the Bath in 1893, this being the only instance of a Lord Chancellor being decorated with an order. In 1893 he became, at its foundation, president of the Society of Comparative Legislation. In 1897 he was appointed, jointly with Lord Justice Collins, to represent Great Britain on the Venezuela Boundary Commission, which met in Paris in the spring of 1899. Such a complicated business involved a careful study of maps and historic documents. Not content with this, he accepted in 1898 a seat on the joint high commission appointed to adjudicate in the Alaska boundary dispute and to adjust boundaries and other important questions pending between Great Britain and Canada on the one hand and the United States on the other hand. He started for the US in July of that year, and was received cordially at Washington D.C.. His fellow commissioners elected him their president. Death In February 1899, while the commission was in full swing, Herchell slipped in the street and fractured his pelvis.Indicated as cause of his ensuing death. His constitution, which at one time was a robust one, had been undermined by constant hard work, and proved unequal to sustaining the shock. On 1 March, only two weeks after the accident, he died at the Shoreham Hotel, Washington, a post-mortem examination revealing heart disease. John Hay, United States Secretary of State, at once telegraphed to Joseph Hodges Choate, the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, the deep sorrow felt by President William McKinley. Sir Wilfrid Laurier said the next day, in the parliament chamber at Ottawa, that he regarded Herschell's death as a misfortune to Canada and to the British Empire. A funeral service held in St John's Episcopal Church, Washington, was attended by the president and vice-president of the United States, by the cabinet ministers, the judges of the Supreme Court, the members of the joint high commission, and a large number of senators and other representative men. The body was brought to London in a British man-of-war, and a second funeral service was held in Westminster Abbey before it was conveyed to its final resting-place at Tincleton, Dorset, in the parish church where he had been married. Family Herschell left a widow whom he had married in 1876, Agnes Adela, daughter of Edward Leigh Kindersley and granddaughter of Vice- Chancellor Kindersley. Lady Herschell died at Pau 23 February 1902. They left a son, Richard Farrer Herschell (b. 1878), who succeeded as second baron, and two daughters, including the artist Agnes Freda Forres.

In 1871, be became a member of the Committee of Seventy in New York City, which was instrumental in breaking up the Tweed Ring, and later assisted in the prosecution of the indicted officials. He served as president of the American Bar Association, the New York State Bar Association, and the New York City Bar Association. In the retrial of the General Fitz-John Porter case, he obtained a reversal of the decision of the original court-martial. His greatest reputation was won perhaps in cross-examination. In politics, he allied himself with the Republican Party on its organization, being a frequent speaker in presidential campaigns, beginning with that of 1856. He never held political office, although he was a candidate for the Republican U.S. senatorial nomination for New York against Senator Thomas C. Platt in 1897. In 1894, he was president of the New York state constitutional convention. U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom He was appointed, by President McKinley, U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom to succeed John Hay in 1899, and remained in this position after Theodore Roosevelt's ascendancy to the presidency until the spring of 1905. In England, he won great personal popularity, and accomplished much in fostering the good relations of the two great English-speaking powers. He was one of the representatives of the United States at the second Peace Congress at the Hague in 1907.Edward Sandford Martin, The Life of Joseph Hodges Choate (1920) Later life Upon the outbreak of the World War I, he ardently supported the cause of the Allies. He severely criticized President Wilson's hesitation to recommend America's immediate cooperation, but shortly before his death retracted his criticism. He was chairman of the mayor's committee in New York for entertaining the British and French commissions in 1917. His death was hastened by the physical strain of his constant activities in this connection. Personal life Photograph of Caroline Sterling Choate, May 13, 1902. On October 16, 1861, he married Caroline Dutcher Sterling Choate (1837‚Äì1929), who had been born in Salisbury, Connecticut. She was the daughter of Caroline Mary (n√©e Dutcher) Sterling and Frederick Augustine Sterling and a distant relative of Frederick A. Sterling. Caroline was an artist and an advocate for women's education, helping to establish both of Brearley School and Barnard College. Joseph and Caroline were the parents of five children, two of whom predeceased their parents: * Ruluff Sterling Choate (September 24, 1864-April 5, 1884) * George Choate (born January 28, 1867-1937) * Josephine Choate (January 9, 1869-July 20, 1896) * (December 26, 1870‚Äì1958), who did not marry and became a gardener and philanthropist. * Joseph Hodges Choate Jr. (February 2, 1876‚Äì1968), who married Cora Lyman Oliver, daughter of General Robert Shaw Oliver, in 1903. The family owned a large country house, known as Naumkeag, which was designed by Stanford White and is today open to the public as a nonprofit museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Choate died on May 14, 1917 at his residence, 8 East 63rd Street in Manhattan. His funeral was held on May 17th at St. Bartholomew's Church in New York, where it was attended by the British Ambassador, Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the French Minister of Education, M. Hovelacque, and the Assistant Secretary of State, William Phillips, among many others. He was buried in the Stockbridge Cemetery in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Memorial services were held on May 22 in London, England, and on May 31 at Trinity Church on Wall Street. Descendants Through his granddaughter, Helen Choate Platt (1906‚Äì1974), he is the great-grandfather of diplomat Nicholas Platt (b. 1936), the former U.S. Ambassador to Zambia, the Philippines, and Pakistan; and the great-great-grandfather of actor Oliver Platt (b. 1960). Honors and legacy He was awarded an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) by the University of Edinburgh in March 1900; another LL.D. from Yale University in October 1901, during celebrations for the bicentenary of the university; an honorary doctorate (D.C.L.) by the University of Oxford in June 1902; and an honorary degree by the University of St Andrews in October 1902. In 1919, two years after his death, members of the Harvard Club of New York City established the Joseph Hodges Choate Memorial Fellowship at Harvard University to commemorate his life and legacy. It is awarded each year to a student from the University of Cambridge on the recommendation of the Cambridge Vice-Chancellor for study in any Department of Harvard University. The Fellow resides in the Choate Suite in John Winthrop House and his or her name is recorded on a board in the House Dining Hall.

In the fall of 1820 he was entered at the Dane Law School in Cambridge, under the instruction of Chief Justice Parker and Professor Asahel Stearns. In the following year Choate studied in Washington, D.C. in the office of William Wirt, then Attorney General of the United States. Career Rufus Choate memorial statue by noted American sculptor Daniel Chester French, John Adams Courthouse, Boston, Massachusetts He was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1823 and practiced at what was later South Danvers (now Peabody) for five years, during which time he served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1825‚Äì1826) and in the Massachusetts Senate (1827). In 1828, he moved to Salem, where his successful conduct of several important lawsuits brought him prominently into public notice. In 1830 he was elected to Congress as a Whig from Salem, defeating the Jacksonian candidate for re-election, Benjamin Crowninshield, a former United States Secretary of the Navy, and in 1832 he was re-elected. His career in Congress was marked by a speech in defence of a protective tariff. Choate lived on Winthrop Place, Boston, 1851-1859State Street Trust Company. Forty of Boston's historic houses. 1912. In 1834, before the completion of his second term, he resigned and established himself in the practice of law in Boston. Already his reputation as a speaker had spread beyond New England, and he was much sought after as an orator for public occasions. For several years, he devoted himself unremittingly to his profession but, in 1841, succeeded fellow Dartmouth graduate Daniel Webster in the United States Senate. Shortly afterwards he delivered an address at the memorial services for President William Henry Harrison at Faneuil Hall. In the Senate, he spoke on the tariff, the Oregon boundary, in favor of the Fiscal Bank Act, and in opposition to the annexation of Texas. On Webster's re-election to the Senate in 1845, Choate resumed his law practice. He later served a short term as attorney-general of Massachusetts in 1853‚Äì1854. In 1846, Choate convinced a jury that the accused, Albert Tirrell, did not cut the throat of his lover, or, if he did so, he did it while sleepwalking, under the 'insanity of sleep'. His successful use of sleepwalking as a defense against murder charges was the first time in American legal history this defense was successful in a murder prosecution. He was a faithful supporter of Webster's policy as declared in the latter's Seventh of March Speech of 1850 and labored to secure for him the presidential nomination at the Whig National Convention in 1852. In 1853, he was a member of the state constitutional convention. In 1856, he refused to follow most of his former Whig associates into the Republican Party and gave his support to Democrat James Buchanan, whom he considered the representative of a national instead of a sectional party.  Health  In 1850 Choate traveled Europe for three months to improve his health. He was accompanied by his old friend and well-known lawyer, the Hon. Joseph Bell, who married Choate's sister. In 1859, failing health led him to seek rest yet again in Europe. In June 1859, he sailed from Boston to England, became worse and left the ship at Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he had died on July 13.  Family  With his wife Helen Olcott, whom he married on March 29, 1825, Choate had seven children: Catherine Bell (1826-1830), an infant child (1828-1828), Helen Olcott (1830-1918), Sarah (1831-1875), Rufus (1834-1866), Miriam Foster (1835-??), and Caroline (1837-1840).

Graham's poetry was mostly overlooked in his lifetime; however, partly thanks to the support of Harold Pinter, his work was eventually acknowledged. He was represented in the second edition of the Penguin Book of Contemporary Verse (Harmondsworth, UK, 1962) and the Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry (Oxford University Press, 2001). Early life and work Graham was born in Greenock. In 1932, he left school to become an apprentice draughtsman and then studied structural engineering at Stow College, Glasgow. He was awarded a bursary to study literature for a year at Newbattle Abbey College in 1938. Graham spent the war years working at a number of jobs in Scotland and Ireland before moving to Cornwall in 1944. His first book, Cage Without Grievance was published in 1942. Graham and the neo-romantics The 1940s were prolific years for Graham, and he published four more books during that decade. These were The Seven Journeys (1944), 2ND Poems (1945), The Voyages of Alfred Wallis (1948) and The White Threshold (1949). The style of these early poems led critics to see Graham as part of the neo-romantic group that included Dylan Thomas and George Barker. The affinities between these three poets derive from a common interest in poets like Gerard Manley Hopkins, Arthur Rimbaud and Hart Crane, and, in the case of Thomas and Graham, a taste for the Bohemian lifestyle of the London literary scene. In 1947, Graham received the Atlantic Award for Literature, and lectured at New York UniversityBook cover blurb Collected Poems, 1942-1977, Faber and Faber, London 1979 whilst spending a year on a reading touring of the United States. He moved to London to be nearer the hub of its Bohemian world. Here he came into contact with T. S. Eliot, then editor of Faber and Faber, who published The White Threshold. Faber and Faber remained Graham's publishers for the rest of his life. The Nightfishing and legacy In 1954, Graham returned to Cornwall to live near the St Ives, Cornwall artists' colony. Here he became friendly with several of the resident painters, including Bryan Wynter and Roger Hilton. The following year, Faber and Faber published his The Nightfishing, a book whose title poem marked a dramatic change in Graham's poetry. The poem moved on from his earlier style and moved away from the neo- romantic/apocalyptic tag. Unfortunately for the poet, the poem's appearance coincided with the rise of the Movement with their open hostility to the neo- romantics. Despite the support of Eliot and Hugh MacDiarmid, the book was neither a critical nor a popular success. It was to be fifteen years before Graham published another book, Malcolm Mooney's Land (1970). This, and his last book, Implements In Their Places are truly original and enduring poetic achievements, for which Graham is slowly coming to be recognised. For many years, he had lived in semi-poverty on his income as a writer, but in 1974 he received a Civil List pension of ¬£500 per year. Perhaps because of this alleviation of his financial circumstances, Graham began to publish with more frequency, with Implements in their Places (1977), Collected Poems 1942‚Äì1977 (1979) and an American-published Selected Poems (1980). He died in Madron, Cornwall in 1986. His last collection Aimed at Nobody was published posthumously in 1993, and a book of Uncollected Poems appeared in 1990. Faber brought out a new Selected Poems in 1996. The Nightfisherman: Selected Letters was published in 1999 and New Collected Poems in 2005. All of Graham's poems have a location, a plot and setting (or narrative) as Graham insisted \\"the first act of engagement of reader and poem was in reading it aloud. This tested the syntax, pace and tone of poem and reader.\\"Schmidt , Michael The Great Modern Poets Quercus Poetry 2006 Posthumous publication activity indicates Graham's reputation has grown in recent years. Some might argue this is partly due to Harold Pinter's often-expressed enthusiasm for the poet, or attribute his increasing recognition to the widespread advocacy of poets associated with the British Poetry Revival. However, Graham's work was represented in the anthology Conductors of Chaos (1996) by a selection introduced by the poet and critic Tony Lopez, who also wrote a book-length study, The Poetry of W. S. Graham (1989). Marriage, death and recognition The Grahams' home in Madron He married another poet, Agnes Kilpatrick Dunsmuir (1909‚Äì1999), known as Nessie Dunsmuir.New Collected Poems, page 375. She is addressed by name in stanza 6 of \\"To my wife at midnight\\", pp. 262-265 He died on 9 January 1986. Copyright in Graham's works is held by his daughter, Rosalind Mudaliar. In 2006, 20 years after his death, memorial plaques were unveiled in Fore Street, Madron where he spent his final years, and at his birthplace, 1 Hope Street, Greenock. In an event to mark his centenary year, a memorial stone to Graham was unveiled in the Makars' Court, Edinburgh on 14 June 2018, and Graham's daughter Rosalind Mudaliar donated his writing chair to the Scottish Poetry Library.

He is often known simply as Eisai/Y≈çsai Zenji (Ê†ÑË•øÁ¶ÖÂ∏´), literally \\"Zen master Eisai\\". Biography Born in Bitch≈´ Province (modern-day Okayama, Okayama), Eisai was ordained as a monk in the Tendai sect. Dissatisfied with the state of Buddhism at the time, in 1168 he set off on his first trip to Mt. Tiantai in China, the origin of the sect, where he learned of the primacy of the Chan (later known in Japan as Zen) school in Chinese Buddhism of the time. He spent only six months in China on this first trip, but returned in 1187 for a longer stay as a disciple of Xuan Huaichang, a master in the Linji (Rinzai) line, at Jingde Si (Ching-te-ssu, ÊôØÂæ∑ÂØ∫) monastery.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1962). Sovereign and Subject, p. 238. After his certification as a Zen teacher, Eisai returned to Japan in 1191, bringing with him Zen scriptures and tea seeds. He immediately founded the H≈çon Temple in remote Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan's first Zen temple. Eisai set about slowly propagating the new faith, trying to gain the respect of both the Tendai school and the Imperial court through careful diplomacy. Faced with the sometimes violent opposition of traditional schools of Buddhism such as Tendai, Shingon and Pure Land, Eisai finally left Kyoto for the north-east to Kamakura in 1199, where the sh≈çgun and the newly ascendant warrior class enthusiastically welcomed his teachings. H≈çj≈ç Masako, Yoritomo's widow, allowed him to build Jufuku-ji, the first Zen temple in Kamakura. Eisai founded Kennin-ji in Kyoto in 1202 on land gifted to him by Yoritomo's son, the second Kamakura sh≈çgun Minamoto no Yoriie.Japanese Buddhism: a cultural history, Tamura, Kosei, p.96 Eisai died in 1215 at the age of 74, and is buried in Kennin-ji's temple grounds. One feature of Eisai's activity not often noted is his continued eclecticism. He never renounced his status as a Tendai monk, and until the end of his life continued to engage in Tendai esoteric practices. Though he is credited with transmission of the Rinzai line to Japan, it remained for later teachers to establish a distinctly Japanese Zen free of admixture with the teachings of other schools. Among his notable disciples was Eihei D≈çgen, who himself traveled to China and returned to found the S≈çt≈ç school of Zen in Japan. Way of the Tea Eisai is also credited with the beginning of the tea tradition in Japan, by bringing green tea seeds from China, back from his second trip in 1191, and writing the book Âñ´Ëå∂È§äÁîüË®ò, Kissa Y≈çj≈çki (in English, Drinking Tea for Health). Legend says that he planted the seeds \\"in the garden of the Ishigamibo at Seburiyama in Hizen\\". In addition to his book, Eisai also garnered attention from another act involving his tea; using it as treatment for sh≈çgun Sanetomo. This is a record of his treatment from the Azuma Kagami: :\\"The sh≈çgun was taken a bit ill, and various attendants attempted to treat him. This was not so serious but was from overindulgence in wine the previous evening. The priest Yojo, who had come to perform incantations and learned the situation, brought a bowl of tea from his temple, saying it was good medicine. He also asked the attendants to give the sh≈çgun a scroll of writings about the virtues of tea, and the sh≈çgun was said to have been greatly pleased. Priest Yojo indicated he had written it recently during his breaks from meditation.\\" Eisai was more focused on the medicinal aspects than anything else, and the main reason for this was the common conception of the time that the world was in mapp≈ç, the Latter age of the Dharma, which was considered by many to be a time of decline. Eisai lived through an era of heavy fighting in Japan, so mapp≈ç played a big role in his promotion of tea, as he thought it was a cure for many ailments and hence would help people get through this perceived difficult time. In Kissa Y≈çj≈çki, the beginning bulk of text after the prefaces concern the alignment of the five elements of Chinese science (earth, fire, water, wood, and metal) with five major organs (the liver, lungs, heart, spleen, and kidneys) and the respective five flavors that each major organ preferred (acidic, pungent, bitter, sweet, and salty). Eisai claimed that the standard Japanese fare of the time contained abundant amounts of each, except for the bitter flavor, which was the cause of the many heart diseases the Japanese suffered from.

The Promotion of Zen for the Protection of the Country (K≈çzen gokokuron ËààÁ¶ÖË≠∑ÂõΩË´ñ)  During the Nara and Heian periods in Japan, Buddhism was used as a tool to unify the country. Eisai was a firm believer that it should be Zen Buddhism to aid the protection of the country. He identified previously established schools of Buddhism as responsible for contributing to Japan‚Äôs struggles. During this time, three major scriptures were used to promote this idea of a unified Buddhist Japan: the Lotus Sutra, Golden Light Sutra, and the Humane King Sutra (Ninn≈çky≈ç). Eisai‚Äôs famous written piece, the K≈çzen gokokuron or The Promotion of Zen for the Protection of the Country, was heavily influenced by the Ninno kyo which states ‚Äúthe preservation of Buddhism is inextricably bound to the preservation of their own country‚Äù. The K≈çzen gokokuron was written with the intention to correct established schools of Buddhism by giving them examples of moral practice and to convince the Minamoto military rulers to support Zen Buddhism and a Zen government. The writing promotes the Zen ideals to bring Buddhism back to its morals and practices. Eisai‚Äôs writing depends heavily on the idea that Buddhism is critical for a functioning society. The K≈çzen gokokuron is often regarded as nationalistic propaganda, and due to the compromises he made when working to install Zen Buddhism in Japan, people disregard the significance of the K≈çzen gokokuron when reading it from a ‚ÄúPure‚Äù Zen perspective.

The First Army included Indian and Portuguese forces during the First World War and American and French units during the Second World War. First World War The First Army was part of the British Army during the First World War and was formed on 26 December 1914 when the corps of the British Expeditionary Force were divided into the First Army under Lieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig and the Second Army under Horace Smith-Dorrien.The British Armies of 1914‚Äì1918 First Army had the Ist, IVth and the Indian Corps under command.THE SILENT GENERAL: HORNE OF THE FIRST ARMY, Don Farr, P.39 The First Army suffered reverses at Vimy Ridge in May 1916 and at Fromelles the following month.

It was formed to command the American and British land forces which had landed as part of Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, in Morocco and Algeria on 8 November 1942. It was commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Kenneth Anderson. The First Army headquarters was formally activated on 9 November 1942 when Anderson arrived in Algiers to assume command of the redesignated Eastern Task Force.Playfair, p. 153. The First Army initially consisted of American and British formations only. After the surrender of French forces following the German abrogation of their armistice agreement with Vichy France, French units were also added to the First Army's order of battle. It eventually consisted of four corps, the US II Corps, the British V Corps, British IX Corps and French XIX Corps. After the landings, Anderson's forces rushed east in a bid to capture Tunis and Bizerte before German forces could reach the two cities in large numbers. They failed. Following that lack of success, a period of consolidation was forced upon them. The logistics support for the First Army was greatly improved and bases for its accompanying aircraft greatly multiplied. By the time General Sir Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army approached the Tunisian border from the east, following its long pursuit of Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel's forces after El Alamein, the First Army was again ready to strike. Supported by elements of XII Tactical Air Command and No. 242 Group RAF, the First Army carried the main weight of General Sir Harold Alexander's 18th Army Group's offensive to conclude the Tunisian Campaign and finish Axis forces in North Africa off. The victory was won in May 1943 in a surrender that, in numbers captured at least, equalled Stalingrad. Shortly after the surrender, the First Army was disbanded, having served its purpose.

The delta-winged, single turbojet engined Skyhawk was designed and produced by Douglas Aircraft Company, and later by McDonnell Douglas. It was originally designated A4D under the U.S. Navy's pre-1962 designation system. The Skyhawk is a relatively lightweight aircraft, with a maximum takeoff weight of , and has a top speed of . The aircraft's five hardpoints support a variety of missiles, bombs, and other munitions. It is capable of carrying a bomb load equivalent to that of a World War II‚Äìera Boeing B-17 bomber, and can deliver nuclear weapons using a low-altitude bombing system and a \\"loft\\" delivery technique. The A-4 was originally powered by the Wright J65 turbojet engine; from the A-4E onwards, the Pratt & Whitney J52 engine was used. Skyhawks played key roles in the Vietnam War, the Yom Kippur War, and the Falklands War. Sixty years after the aircraft's first flight in 1954, some of the 2,960 produced (through February 1979) remain in service with the Argentine Air Force and the Brazilian Naval Aviation. Design and development The XA4D-1 prototype in 1954 The second production A4D-1 The Skyhawk was designed by Douglas Aircraft's Ed Heinemann in response to a U.S. Navy call for a jet-powered attack aircraft to replace the older Douglas AD Skyraider (later redesignated A-1 Skyraider).Kilduff 1983, pp. 14‚Äì15. Heinemann opted for a design that would minimize its size, weight, and complexity. The result was an aircraft that weighed only half of the Navy's weight specification.Wilson 1993, p. 135. It had a wing so compact that it did not need to be folded for carrier stowage. The first 500 production examples cost an average of $860,000 each, less than the Navy's one million dollar maximum. The diminutive Skyhawk soon received the nicknames \\"Scooter\\", \\"Kiddiecar\\", \\"Bantam Bomber\\", \\"Tinker Toy Bomber\\", and, on account of its speed and nimble performance, \\"Heinemann's Hot-Rod\\".O'Rourke, G.G. \\"Of Hosenoses, Stoofs, and Lefthanded Spads.\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings, July 1968. The XA4D-1 prototype set a world speed record of 695.163 mph on 15 October 1955. The aircraft is of conventional post-World War II design, with a low-mounted delta wing, tricycle undercarriage, and a single turbojet engine in the rear fuselage, with two air intakes on the fuselage sides. The tail is of cruciform design, with the horizontal stabilizer mounted above the fuselage. Armament consisted of two 20 mm (.79 in caliber) Colt Mk 12 cannons, one in each wing root, with 100 rounds per gun (the A-4M Skyhawk II and types based on the A-4M have 200 rounds per gun), plus a large variety of bombs, rockets, and missiles carried on a hardpoint under the fuselage centerline and hardpoints under each wing (originally one per wing, later two).\\"Technical Data.\\" a4skyhawk.org. Retrieved: 21 November 2015. The short- span delta wing did not require the complexity of wingtip folding, saving an estimated . Its spars were machined from a single forging that spanned across both wingtips. The leading edge slats were designed to drop automatically at the appropriate speed by gravity and air pressure, saving weight and space by omitting actuation motors and switches. Similarly the main undercarriage did not penetrate the main wing spar, designed so that when retracted only the wheel itself was inside the wing and the undercarriage struts were housed in a fairing below the wing. Thus the wing structure was lighter with the same overall strength. The rudder was constructed of a single panel reinforced with external ribs. An A4D Skyhawk with the rear fuselage removed and an engine being slid into place, Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, 1959 The turbojet engine was accessed for service or replacement by removing the aft section of the fuselage and sliding out the engine. This obviated the need for access doors with their hinges and latches further reducing weight and complexity. This is the opposite of what can often happen in aircraft design where a small weight increase in one area leads to a compounding increase in weight in other areas to compensate, creating a demand for more powerful, heavier engines, larger wing and empennage area, and so on in a vicious circle.\\"Skyhawk.\\" Air Victory Museum.

This allows the aircraft to supply others of the same type, reducing the need for dedicated tanker aircraft‚Äîa particular advantage for small air arms or when operating in remote locations. This allows for greatly improved operational flexibility and reassurance against the loss or malfunction of tanker aircraft, though this procedure reduces the effective combat force on board the carrier. A designated supply A-4 would mount a center-mounted \\"buddy store\\", a large external fuel tank with a hose reel in the aft section and an extensible drogue refueling bucket. This aircraft was fueled up without armament and launched first. Attack aircraft would be armed to the maximum and given as much fuel as was allowable by maximum takeoff weight limits, far less than a full tank. Once airborne, they would then proceed to top off their fuel tanks from the tanker using the A-4's fixed refueling probe on the starboard side of the aircraft nose. They could then sortie with both full armament and fuel loads. The A-4 was rarely used for refueling in U.S. service after the KA-3 Skywarrior tanker became available aboard the larger carriers. The versatility of the capability and the retirement of the Skywarrior meant that the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet now includes this capability. Thermal cockpit shield for nuclear weapons delivery The A-4 was also designed to be able to make an emergency landing, in the event of a hydraulic failure, on the two drop tanks nearly always carried by these aircraft. Such landings resulted in only minor damage to the nose of the aircraft which could be repaired in less than an hour. The Navy issued a contract for the type on 12 June 1952,Gann Wings of Fame No. 4, p. 99. and the first prototype first flew from Edwards Air Force Base, California on 22 June 1954.Elward 2000, p. 25. Deliveries to Navy and Marine Corps squadrons (to VA-72 and VMA-224 respectively) commenced in late 1956.Gann Wings of Fame No. 4, p. 103. The Skyhawk remained in production until 1979, with 2,960 aircraft built, including 555 two-seat trainers.Gann Wings of Fame No. 4, p. 100. The last production A-4, an A-4M of Marine squadron VMA-331 had the flags of all nations that operated the A-4 painted on its fuselage sides. Operational history=United States The Skyhawk proved to be a relatively common United States Navy aircraft export of the postwar era. Due to its small size, it could be operated from the older, smaller World War II-era aircraft carriers still used by many smaller navies during the 1960s. These older ships were often unable to accommodate newer Navy fighters such as the F-4 Phantom II and F-8 Crusader, which were faster and more capable than the A-4, but significantly larger and heavier than older naval fighters. The Navy operated the A-4 in both Regular Navy and Naval Reserve light attack squadrons (VA). Although the A-4's use as a training and adversary aircraft would continue well into the 1990s, the Navy began removing the aircraft from its frontline attack squadrons in 1967, with the last ones (Super Foxes of VA-55/212/164) being retired in 1976.

Trainer versions of the Skyhawk remained in Navy service, however, finding a new lease on life with the advent of \\"adversary training\\", where the nimble A-4 was used as a stand-in for the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 in dissimilar air combat training (DACT). It served in that role at TOPGUN until 1999. A-4F Skyhawk of the Blue Angels US Navy aerobatic team in 1975 The A-4's nimble performance also made it suitable to replace the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II when the Navy downsized its aircraft for the Blue Angels demonstration team, until McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornets were available in the 1980s. The last U.S. Navy Skyhawks, TA-4J models belonging to the composite squadron VC-8, remained in military use for target towing, and as adversary aircraft, for combat training at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads. These aircraft were officially retired on 3 May 2003. Skyhawks were well loved by their crews for being tough and agile. These attributes, along with their low purchase and operating cost as well as easy maintenance, have contributed to the popularity of the A-4 with American and international armed forces. Besides the U.S., at least three other nations have used A-4 Skyhawks in combat (Argentina, Israel, and Kuwait). =Vietnam War era= VA-146 A-4Cs over the Gulf of Tonkin in August 1964; steams below. Skyhawks were the U.S. Navy's primary light attack aircraft used over North Vietnam during the early years of the Vietnam War; they were later supplanted by the A-7 Corsair II in the U.S. Navy light attack role. Skyhawks carried out some of the first air strikes by the US during the conflict, and a Marine Skyhawk is believed to have dropped the last American bombs on the country. Notable naval aviators who flew the Skyhawk included Lieutenant Commanders Everett Alvarez, Jr. and John McCain, and Commander James Stockdale.

The A-4B model did not have an air-to-air radar, and it required visual identification of targets and guidance from either ships in the fleet or an airborne Grumman E-1 Tracer AEW aircraft. Lightweight and safer to land on smaller decks, Skyhawks would later also play a similar role flying from Australian, Argentinean, and Brazilian upgraded World War II surplus light ASW carriers, which were unable to operate most large modern fighters.\\"VA-93 Blue Blazers: Events 15 October 1963.\\" skyhawk.org.

A total of 32 A-4s were lost to surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and one A-4 was lost in aerial combat to a MiG-17 on 25 April 1967.Hobson 2001, pp. 269‚Äì270. =Training and adversary role= The A-4 Skyhawk, in the two-seat TA-4J configuration, was introduced to a training role replacing the TF-9J Cougar. The TA-4J served as the advanced jet trainer in white and orange markings for decades until being replaced by the T-45 Goshawk. Additional TA-4Js were assigned to Instrument Training RAGs at all the Navy master jet bases under RCVW-12 and RCVW-4. The Instrument RAGs initially provided jet transition training for Naval Aviators during the time period when Naval Aviation still had a great number of propeller-driven aircraft and also provided annual instrument training and check rides for Naval Aviators. The assigned TA-4J models were installed with collapsible hoods so the aviator under training had to demonstrate instrument flying skills without any outside reference. These units were VF-126 at NAS Miramar, California; VA-127 (later VFA-127; NAS FALLON, NV) at NAS Lemoore, California; VF-43 at NAS Oceana, Virginia; and VA-45 (later VF-45) at NAS Cecil Field, Florida until its later move to NAS Key West, Florida. VFC-13 adversary A-4Fs at NAS Fallon in 1993 Additional single-seat A-4 Skyhawks were also assigned to composite squadrons (VC) worldwide to provide training and other services to deployed units. These included VC-1 at NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii; VC-7 at NAS Miramar, California; VC-5 at NAS Cubi Point, Republic of the Philippines; VC-8 at NS Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico; VC-10 at NAVBASE Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, and Naval Reserve squadrons VC-12 (later VFC-12) at NAS Oceana, Virginia and VC-13 (later VFC-13) at NAS Miramar, California until its later move to NAS Fallon, Nevada. With renewed emphasis on Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) training brought on with the establishment of the Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN) in 1969, the availability of A-4 Skyhawks in both the Instrument RAGs and Composite Squadrons at the master jet bases presented a ready resource of the nimble Skyhawks that had become the TOPGUN preferred surrogate for the MiG-17. At the time, the F-4 Phantom was just beginning to be exploited to its full potential as a fighter and had not performed as well as expected against the smaller North Vietnamese MiG-17 and MiG-21 opponents. TOPGUN introduced the notion of dissimilar air combat training (DACT) using modified A-4E/Fs. Modified aircraft, called \\"Mongoose\\", lost the dorsal hump, the 20 mm cannon with their ammo systems, and the external stores, although sometimes the centerline station was kept. The slats were fixed.\\"Skyhawk Mongoose and Super Fox.\\" http://a4skyhawk.org . Retrieved: 27 November 2015. The small size of the Skyhawk and superb low speed handling in the hands of a well trained aviator made it ideal to teach fleet aviators the finer points of DACT. The squadrons eventually began to display vivid threat type paint schemes signifying their transition into the primary role of Adversary training. To better perform the Adversary role, single-seat A-4E and F models were introduced into the role, but the ultimate adversary Skyhawk was the Super Fox, which was equipped with the uprated J52-P-408 engine. This variant had entered service in 1974 with VA-55/VA-164/VA-212 on the final USS Hancock cruise and had been the variant that the Blue Angels had selected in 1973. The surplus of former USMC Skyhawks resulted in A-4M versions being used by both VF-126 and TOPGUN. Even though the A-4 was augmented by the F-5E, F-21 (Kfir), F-16, and F/A-18 in the adversary role, the A-4 remained a viable threat surrogate until it was retired by VF-43 in 1993 and shortly thereafter by VFC-12. The last A-4 fleet operators were VC-8, which retired its Skyhawks in 2003. The A-4M was also operated by the Operations Maintenance Detachment (OMD) in an adversary role based at NAS Dallas, Texas for the Naval Air Reserve. Many of the aviators that flew the four jets were attached to NAS Dallas, including the Commanding Officer of the air station. The aircraft were instrumental in training and development of ACM for Naval Air Reserve fighter squadrons VF-201 and VF-202 flying the F-4 Phantom II and later the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. The unit also completed several missions involving target towing to NAS Key West, Florida; NAS Kingsville, Texas, and deployments to NAS Miramar, California and NAS Fallon, Nevada for adversary support. The detachment was under the operational command of the Commander Fleet Logistics Support Wing (CFLSW), also based at NAS Dallas. Israel An IAF A-4N on static display. Note the extended tailpipe.

This was an A-4E which featured improved avionics and the improved thrust J52-P-8A engine. Armament consisted of twin DEFA 30 mm cannon in place of the Colt Mk.12 20 mm cannons. Later modifications included the avionics hump and an extended tailpipe, implemented in Israel by IAI. The extended tailpipe gave greater protection against heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles. A total of 90 A-4Hs were delivered, and were Heyl Ha'avir's (Israels Air Force) primary attack plane in the War of Attrition. IAF A-4Hs awaiting disposal in 2009 following their retirement In early 1973, the improved A-4N Skyhawk for Israel entered service, based on the A-4M models used by the U.S. Marine Corps. The different model Skyhawks carried out bombing missions in the Yom Kippur War, and a considerable proportion of the tactical sorties. They also attacked in Operation Peace for the Galilee, and one of them shot down a Syrian MiG-17. The IAF also operated two-seat models, for operations as well as advanced training and retraining. The first training models arrived in 1967, with the first batch of Skyhawks. During the Yom Kippur war, the Skyhawk order of battle was reinforced with TA-4F and TA-4J models. The IAF selected in 2003 RADA Electronic Industries Ltd. to upgrade its A-4 trainer fleet with weapon delivery, navigation and training systems. Integration of a multifunction and Head-up Display produced an advanced Lead in fighter trainer for the IAF's future fighter pilots.

Eastern icon of nine orders of angels. In Christianity, angels are agents of God, based on angels in Judaism.Barker, Margaret (2004). An Extraordinary Gathering of Angels, M Q Publications. The most influential Christian angelic hierarchy was that put forward by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite in the 4th or 5th century in his book De Coelesti Hierarchia (On the Celestial Hierarchy). During the Middle Ages, many schemes were proposed about the hierarchy of angels, some drawing on and expanding on Pseudo- Dionysius, others suggesting completely different classifications. According to medieval Christian theologians, the angels are organized into several orders, or \\"Angelic Choirs\\". Pseudo-Dionysius (On the Celestial Hierarchy) and Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologica) drew on passages from the New Testament, specifically in Galatians 3:26-28, Matthew 22:24-33, Ephesians 1:21-23, and Colossians 1:16, to develop a schema of three Hierarchies, Spheres or Triads of angels, with each Hierarchy containing three Orders or Choirs. Although both authors drew on the New Testament, the Biblical canon is unclear on the subject, and these hierarchies are considered less definitive than biblical material. As referred to in the theological doctrine of the communion of saints, in Paradise there is a common and unique vision of the truth and contemplation of the Face of God, without any kind of difference between angels or human souls. The Summa theologiae states that there exist different degree in respect of the creation, about the power of intercession to God and of direct entrustment in the human lives.  First Sphere  The first sphere angels serve as the heavenly servants of God the Son incarnated.  Seraphim  Seraphim surround the divine throne in this illustration from the Petites Heures de Jean de Berry, a 14th-century illuminated manuscript. Seraphim (singular \\"Seraph\\") are, literally translated, \\"burning ones\\". The word seraph is normally a synonym for serpents when used in the Hebrew Bible. Mentioned in , Seraphim are the highest angelic class and they serve as the caretakers of God's throne and continuously shout praises: \\"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory!\\" According to , the Seraphim are described as fiery six-winged beings, with two wings that cover their faces, two that cover their feet, and the last two used to fly.  Cherubim  A cherub, as described by Ezekiel and according to traditional Christian iconography. Cherubim have four faces: one of a man, an ox, a lion, and an eagle (later adopted as the symbols of the four evangelists). They have four conjoined wings covered with eyes (although Revelation 4:8 appears to describe them with six wings like the seraphim), a lion's body, and the feet of oxen. Cherubim guard the way to the tree of life in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:24) and the throne of God (Ezekiel 28:14‚Äì16). The cherubim are mentioned in Genesis 3:24, Exodus 25:17‚Äì22, 2 Chronicles 3:7‚Äì14, Ezekiel 10:12‚Äì14 and 28:14‚Äì16, and 1 Kings 6:23‚Äì28. Modern English usage has blurred the distinction between cherubim and putti. Putti are the often wingless (sometimes winged) human baby/toddler-like beings traditionally used in figurative art. St. Thomas Aquinas imagined Satan as a fallen Cherub.  Thrones  One traditional depiction of the chariot vision, based on the description in Ezekiel. The \\"Thrones\\" (, pl. of thronos), or Elders, are a class of celestial beings mentioned by Paul the Apostle in Colossians 1:16 (New Testament). They are living symbols of God's justice and authority, and have as one of their symbols the throne. It is not unusual to find that the Thrones are associated, by some, with the Ophanim or Erelim from the Jewish angelic hierarchy. The idea that they are separate or one and the same is debated. The Ophanim or Ofanim, also called galgalim, refer to the wheels seen in Ezekiel's vision of the chariot in Ezekiel 1:15-21. One of the Dead Sea scrolls construes them as angels, late sections of the Book of Enoch portray them as a class of celestial beings who never sleep, but guard the throne of God. The Ophanim (Heb. ofanim: Wheels, from the vision of ) are unusual looking, even compared with the other celestial beings. They are closely connected with the Cherubim: \\"When they moved, the others moved; when they stopped, the others stopped; and when they rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures [Cherubim] was in the wheels.\\" Ezekiel 10:17 NRSV. Which raises the question of if they are angels at all or controlled by the Cherubim. Some Christian theologians that include the Thrones as one of the choirs do not describe them as wheels, describing them as adoring elder men who listen to the will of God and present the prayers of men. The Twenty-Four Elders in the Book of Revelation are usually thought to be part of this group of angels.  Second Sphere  West window of the Church of St Michael and All Angels, Somerton. It depicts Christ the King in the centre with nine angelic figures, each of them represents, higher row: Dominions, Cherubim, Seraphim, and Angels; lower row: Principalities, Thrones, Archangels, Virtues, and Powers. Angels of the Second Sphere work as heavenly governors of the creation by subjecting matter and guiding and ruling the spirits.  Dominations or Lordships  The \\"Dominations\\" (Eph. 1:21; Col. 1:16) (lat. dominatio, plural dominationes, also translated from the Greek term kyriotƒìtes, pl. of kyriotƒìs, as \\"Lordships\\") or \\"Dominions\\" are presented as the hierarchy of celestial beings \\"Lordships\\" in some English translations of the De Coelesti Hierarchia. The Dominations regulate the duties of lower angels. It is only with extreme rarity that the angelic lords make themselves physically known to humans. The Dominations are believed to look like divinely beautiful humans with a pair of feathered wings, much like the common representation of angels, but they may be distinguished from other groups by wielding orbs of light fastened to the heads of their scepters or on the pommel of their swords.  Virtues or Strongholds  These angels are those through which signs and miracles are made in the world.Isidore of Seville: Etymologies The term appears to be linked to the attribute \\"might\\", from the Greek root dynamis (pl. dynameis) in Ephesians 1:21, which is also translated as \\"Virtue\\" or \\"Power\\". They are presented as the celestial Choir \\"Virtues\\", in the Summa Theologica. From Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite's De Coelesti Hierarchia: > \\"The name of the holy Virtues signifies a certain powerful and unshakable > virility welling forth into all their Godlike energies; not being weak and > feeble for any reception of the divine Illuminations granted to it; mounting > upwards in fullness of power to an assimilation with God; never falling away > from the Divine Life through its own weakness, but ascending unwaveringly to > the superessential Virtue which is the Source of virtue: fashioning itself, > as far as it may, in virtue; perfectly turned towards the Source of virtue, > and flowing forth providentially to those below it, abundantly filling them > with virtue.\\"  Powers or Authorities  The \\"Powers\\" (lat. potestas (f), pl. potestates), or \\"Authorities\\", from the Greek exousiai, pl. of exousia (see Greek root in Eph 3:10). The primary duty of the \\"Powers\\" is to supervise the movements of the heavenly bodies to ensure that the cosmos remains in order. Being warrior angels, they also oppose evil spirits, especially those that make use of the matter in the universe, and often cast evil spirits to places of detention. These angels are usually represented as soldiers wearing full armor and helmet, and also having defensive and offensive weapons such as shields and spears or chains respectively.  Third Sphere  Angels who function as heavenly guides, protectors, and messengers to human beings.  Principalities or Rulers  The \\"Principalities\\" () also translated as \\"Princedoms\\" and \\"Rulers\\", from the Greek archai, pl. of archƒì (see Greek root in Eph 3:10), are the angels that guide and protect nations, or groups of peoples, and institutions such as the Church. The Principalities preside over the bands of angels and charge them with fulfilling the divine ministry. There are some who administer and some who assist. The Principalities are shown wearing a crown and carrying a sceptre. Their duty also is said to be to carry out the orders given to them by the upper sphere angels and bequeath blessings to the material world. Their task is to oversee groups of people. They are the educators and guardians of the realm of earth. Like beings related to the world of the germinal ideas, they are said to inspire living things to many things such as art or science. Paul used the term rule and authority in Ephesians 1:21, and rulers and authorities in Ephesians 3:10.  Archangels  Guido Reni's archangel Michael (in the Capuchin church of Santa Maria della Concezione, Rome, 1636) tramples Satan. The word \\"archangel\\" comes from the Greek (archangelos), meaning chief angel, a translation of the Hebrew (rav-mal'√°kh)Strong, J, Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, Riverside Books and Bible House, Iowa Falls (Iowa), . It derives from the Greek archein, meaning to be first in rank or power; and angelos which means messenger or envoy. The word is only used twice in the New Testament: and . Only Michael and Gabriel are mentioned by name in the New Testament. In most Christian traditions Gabriel is also considered an archangel, but there is no direct literary support for this assumption. It is also worth noting that the term \\"archangel\\" appears only in the singular, never plural, and only in specific reference to Michael. Jude 1:9 The name of the archangel Raphael appears only in the Book of Tobit (Tobias). Tobit is considered deuterocanonical by Catholics (both Eastern and Western Rites), Eastern Orthodox Christians, and Anglicans. The Book of Tobit is not, however, acknowledged by most Protestant denominations, such as Reformed Christians or Baptists. Raphael said to Tobias that he was \\"one of the seven who stand before the Lord\\", and it is generally believed that Michael and Gabriel are two of the other six. A fourth Archangel is Uriel whose name literally means \\"Light of God.\\" Uriel's name is the only one not mentioned in the Western Christian Bible, but plays a prominent role in an apocryphon read by Anglican and Russian Orthodox Christians: The second Book of Esdras (fourth Books of Esdras in the Latin Vulgate). In the book, he unveils seven prophecies to the prophet Ezra, after whom the book is named. He also plays a role in the apocryphal Book of Enoch, which is considered canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, and Ethiopian Catholic Churches. The Catholic Church generally does not regard Uriel as an angelVatican bans rogue angels. Telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved 2019-01-03. just as the Book of Enoch is not part of the Catholic Bible used by most CatholicsWhy the book of enoch is not included in the bible. Catholic.com. Retrieved 2019-01-03. either. Another possible interpretation of the seven archangels is that these seven are the seven spirits of God that stand before the throne described in the Book of Enoch, and in the Book of Revelation.Revelation 1:5. The Seven Archangels are said to be the guardian angels of nations and countries, and are concerned with the issues and events surrounding these, including politics, military matters, commerce and trade: e.g. Archangel Michael is traditionally seen as the protector of 'Israel' and of the ecclesia (Gr. root ekklesia from the New Testament passages), theologically equated as the Church, the forerunner of the spiritual New Israel. Some make a distinction between archangel (with a lower-case a) and Archangel (with an uppercase A). The former can denote the second-lowest choir (arch-angels in the sense of being just above the lowest Choir of angels that is called only \\"angels\\") but the latter may denote the highest of all the angels (i.e., Arch-angels in the sense of being above all angels, of any Choir. The seven highest Seraphim, Michael, being the highest of all).  Angels  An angel comforting Jesus, by Carl Heinrich Bloch, 1865‚Äì1879. The \\"angels\\" or malakhim (Heb.: ◊û÷∑◊ú÷∞◊ê÷∏◊õ÷¥◊ô◊ù), i.e. the \\"plain\\" angels (Gr.: ·ºÑŒ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøŒπ, pl. of Gr.: ·ºÑŒ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÇ, angelos, i.e. messenger or envoy), are the lowest order of celestial beings, and the most recognized. They are the ones most concerned with the affairs of men. Within the category of the angels, there are many different kinds, with different functions. The angels are sent as messengers to humanity. Personal guardian angels come from this class. = Personal guardian angels = Personal guardian angels are not of a separate order, but rather come from the order of Angels. It is a common belief that they are assigned to every human being, Christian or not. It is unknown whether they guard multiple humans during their existence or just one, but the latter is a more typical opinion.  Choirs in medieval theology  abode of God, from Dante's Paradiso, illustrated by Gustave Dor√©. During the Middle Ages, many schemes were proposed, some drawing on and expanding on Pseudo-Dionysius, others suggesting completely different classifications (some authors limited the number of Choirs to seven). Several other hierarchies were proposed, some in nearly inverted order. Some of those schemes are here presented: *Apostolic Constitutions (4th century): **1. Seraphim, 2. Cherubim, 3. Aeons, 4.

Individual angels and demons from the choirs  *Seraphim: In John Milton's Paradise Lost Satan and the Archangels belong to this choir (\\"archangel\\" has here the meaning of \\"most powerful angel\\", not the members of the second lowest choir). Beelzebuth is also addressed as prince of the seraphim in witchcraft litanies.Jules Garinet: Historie de la Magie en France (1818) *Cherubim: In Paradise Lost, Beelzebub and Azazel were cherubim before their fall. St. Thomas Aquinas in Summa Theologica states that Satan belongs to this choir, not to the seraphim. *Thrones: Paradise Lost cites the demons Adramelec and Asmodai. Some sources mention Astaroth as well.Sebastian Michaelis: The Admirable History of the Possession and Conversion of a Penitent Woman *Virtues: Witchcraft litanies mention Belial. *Archangels: The archangels Gabriel, Raphael and Michael, and supposedly the other archangels as well, are usually assigned to this choir, for example in the hierarchies of St. Gregory and St. Isidore of Seville.

Nelly contributed to all lyrics on the album, with Epperson and City Spud also contributing. The album introduced a unique St. Louis, Midwestern sound, and introduces Nelly's vocal style of pop-rap singalongs and Midwestern, Missouri twang. It was supported four successful singles: \\"Country Grammar (Hot Shit)\\", \\"E.I.\\", \\"Ride wit Me\\" and \\"Batter Up\\". Its lead single, \\"Country Grammar (Hot Shit)\\", peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart. \\"E.I.\\" charted at number 16, number 12 and number 11 on the Hot 100, UK Singles Chart and ARIA Singles Chart, respectively. \\"Ride wit Me\\" peaked within the top five on the Hot 100, ARIA Singles Chart, Irish Singles Chart and UK Singles Chart. The album's fourth and final single, \\"Batter Up\\" featuring Murphy Lee and Ali, achieved moderate chart success. Country Grammar received positive reviews, with critics praising Nelly's vocal style and the album's production. It topped the US Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks, and the US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart for six consecutive weeks. It peaked in the top five on the New Zealand Albums Chart and Australian Albums Chart, as well as the top ten on the Canadian Albums Chart and Dutch Albums Chart. The album was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) and Music Canada (MC), denoting shipments of 45,000 and 300,000 copies, respectively. In 2016, Country Grammar became the ninth hip hop album to be certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipment of 10 million copies in the US. Its commercial success secured Nelly's status as one of the most successful hip hop acts of the 2000s decade. On Billboard decade-end chart, Nelly ranked as the third most successful act of the 2000s decade, due largely to the success of Country Grammar and his follow-up album Nellyville (2002). Background and production In his early years, Nelly frequently moved locations within the US, before residing in the city of St. Louis. It was there where he discovered rap artists synonymous within the city; in his teenage years, Nelly moved to University City, where he shifted his aspirations from becoming a baseball player to producing stories and rhymes. Along with some high school friends‚ÄîAli Jones, Torhi Harper, Kyjuan and Lavell Webb‚ÄîNelly formed the group St. Lunatics in 1993. Frustrated by the lack of attention from record companies, the group formed the consensus to allow Nelly to pursue a solo career, with the rest possibly releasing their own solo albums. Nelly produced demos, which were sent to national labels, eventually gaining attention from Universal Records who signed a record deal with Nelly and the St. Lunatics in 1999, with Universal releasing the former's debut album, Country Grammar, in 2000. All songs on Country Grammar were recorded by Steve Eigner, and mixed by Rich Travali. Kenny Dystra provided recording assistance and Jason Standard assisted in mixing. Mastering was performed by Herb Powers, with A&R; directed by Kevin Law and Coordinated by Craig Yoskowitz. Management was provided by Tony Davis and Courtney Benson, with legality handled by Todd Rubenstein. Creative direction was handled by Sandra Brummels, with design and photography done so by BENTO Design and Jonathen Mannion, respectively.

In conjunction, Nelly approaches a pop-rap singalong vocal style, which Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier notes present within Country Grammar tracks including \\"Ride wit Me\\" and \\"E.I.\\". Peter Shapiro described Nelly's vocals as using \\"unforgettable hooks based on schoolyard songs, double-dutch chants, and nonsense rhymes\\". Much of Country Grammar tracks are bass-heavy, that are primarily Southern hip-hop based and minimalistic. In the album's self-titled track, Nelly's vocals are slurred and slow, and are a \\"smooth, slippery-fast instrument\\" with \\"reggae inflections\\". Rolling Stone found the song's lyrics to depict Nelly \\"riding around town in an expensive SUV with an assault weapon\\". \\"Ride wit Me\\" is rap, pop crossover, that samples composition from DeBarge's 1982 \\"I Like It\\", and its lyrics feature Nelly introspecting.

The magazine described the album as a \\"rarity\\", noting stand-out tracks such as the \\"seductive rap/pop crossover\\" \\"Ride wit Me\\", while likening \\"Batter Up\\" to \\"DMX with a humour infusion\\".

Giving the album a B‚Äì, Entertainment Weekly David Browne wrote the album demonstrates that \\"tiresome rap topics\\" are not restricted to \\"the coasts\\". Though what salvages the album is Nelly's \\"smooth, slippery-fast\\" voice, which contains \\"reggae inflections\\". Browne describes the album's content as minimalistic, with \\"introspective moments\\" such as \\"Ride wit Me\\". In Robert Christgau's Consumer Guide review, he wrote that Nelly presents an \\"easy mix of N.O. Bounce, Cleveland thug harmony, and L.A. tweedle-twaddle\\", noting Nelly's heavy accent which makes his hedonism more accessible. People noted that Nelly implements his own \\"laid-back charm\\" to Country Grammar southern hip hop. Despite Nelly showing \\"limited thematic vocabulary\\" he articulates escapism to compensate for this. Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier praised the album's \\"tongue- twisting\\" self-titled track as \\"infectious\\", noting other tracks to contain the same elements, including \\"Ride wit Me\\" and \\"E.I.\\". Birchmeier wrote that the album transcends regional styles such as southern hip hop to appeal to rap-pop audiences, while praising producer Jason \\"Jay E\\" Epperson's contribution to the album. Rolling Stone explained that the album's \\"liquid bass bumps\\" interlopes well with Nelly's \\"wordplay-heavy sing-song rhyme- flow\\", while declaring Country Grammar to be the best thing to come out of St. Louis since comedian Redd Foxx. At the 2001 Soul Train Music Awards, Country Grammar earned Nelly the award for Best R&B;/Soul or Rap New Artist. Nelly was nominated for four awards at the Online Hip-Hop Awards, for Favorite Music Video, Song of the Year (both for \\"E.I.\\"), Album of the Year (for Country Grammar) and Outstanding Graphic Design for his official website. He won the awards for Song of the Year and Artist of the Year. Commercial performance Country Grammar entered the Billboard 200 on the week of July 15, 2000, at number 3, selling 235,000 copies. The album remained within the top 10 for several weeks before topping it on the week of August 17, 2000, selling 235,000 copies and passing 1.5 million in sales that week. Entertainment Weekly put the album's sales down to its support by its lead single, \\"Country Grammar (Hot Shit)\\", as well as the lack of releases from other music artists during that period. The album sold 235,000 copies again the following week, continuing to stay atop the Billboard 200. Country Grammar topped US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart for six consecutive weeks. On October 30, 2000, the album had sold three million copies, and was certified three-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of three million copies. On June 29, 2002, Country Grammar had sold 7.7 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. On July 21, 2016, the album was certified Diamond by the RIAA, denoting shipment of ten million copies in the US. Country Grammar entered the New Zealand Albums Chart on the week of September 24, 2000, at number 5. It reached its peak at number 3, for twenty- eight weeks after its debut on the chart, where it remained there for two non- consecutive weeks. It stayed on the chart for forty-two weeks before dropping out. The album was certified Triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) for shipments of 45,000 units. On the Australian Albums Chart, Country Grammar debuted at number 45. It re-entered the chart five times, and reached its peak at number 4 on the week of October 7, 2001. The album remained on the chart for thirty-three weeks, and was certified Triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). Country Grammar reached at number 7 on the Canadian Albums Chart, and stayed on the chart for twenty-five weeks before dropping out. It was certified Triple Platinum by Music Canada (MC), denoting shipments of 300,000 copies. On the Dutch Albums Chart, the album peaked at number 8. On the UK Albums Chart, Country Grammar reached at number 14, and stayed on it for 31 weeks. It was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), for shipments of 100,000 units. The album peaked within the top thirty on the Belgian Albums Chart (Flanders), Finnish Albums Chart and Danish Albums Chart. It reached number 45 on the German Albums Chart, remaining on it for 43 weeks. It peaked on the Swiss Albums Chart and French Albums Chart at numbers 90 and 109, respectively. Country Grammar topped the US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums year- end chart in 2000. Legacy Country Grammar success cemented Nelly's position as one of the most successful hip hop acts of the emerging decade. Vibe emphasized Nelly's expeditious fame, writing that the rapper debuted without the benefit of \\"guest spots or Pen and Pixel produced teasers on his CD cover\\". The magazine continued to note the rapper's absence of being associated with a notable group, \\"he just came out and sold two million records in less than a month\\". Nelly's success helped in making St. Louis more notable for emerging hip hop acts, increasing the city's general reputation. Country Grammar experienced commercial success, topping the US Billboard 200 chart for five weeks in 2000, eventually going on to sell over 9 million copies in the US, making it the ninth best-selling rap album of all time in the country. It is one of the highest certified albums in the US history, being certified ten times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Nelly ranked third on the Billboard 2000‚Äì2009 decade-end chart, due to the success of Country Grammar as well as his follow-up album Nellyville (2002). The latter album went on to sell 6,488,000 copies in the US. Country Grammar was ranked as the 85th best album of all time on the Billboard Top 200 Albums of All Time.

Herbal medicine (also herbalism) is the study of pharmacognosy and the use of medicinal plants. Plants have been the basis for medical treatments through most of human history, and such traditional medicine is still widely practiced today. Modern medicine makes use of many plant-derived compounds as the basis for evidence-based pharmaceutical drugs. Although herbalism may apply modern standards of effectiveness testing to herbs and medicines derived from natural sources, few high-quality clinical trials and standards for purity or dosage exist. The scope of herbal medicine is sometimes extended to include fungal and bee products, as well as minerals, shells and certain animal parts. Herbal medicine is also called phytomedicine or phytotherapy. Paraherbalism describes alternative and pseudoscientific practices of using unrefined plant or animal extracts as unproven medicines or health-promoting agents. Paraherbalism differs from plant-derived medicines in standard pharmacology because it does not isolate or standardize biologically active compounds, but rather relies on the belief that preserving various substances from a given source with less processing is safer or more effective ‚Äì for which there is no evidence. Herbal dietary supplements most often fall under the phytotherapy category. History A physician preparing an elixir, from an Arabic version of Dioscorides's pharmacopoeia, 1224 Archaeological evidence indicates that the use of medicinal plants dates back to the Paleolithic age, approximately 60,000 years ago. Written evidence of herbal remedies dates back over 5,000 years to the Sumerians, who compiled lists of plants. Some ancient cultures wrote about plants and their medical uses in books called herbals. In ancient Egypt, herbs are mentioned in Egyptian medical papyri, depicted in tomb illustrations, or on rare occasions found in medical jars containing trace amounts of herbs. Among the oldest, lengthiest, and most important medical papyri of ancient Egypt, the Ebers Papyrus dates from about 1550 BC, and covers more than 700 compounds, mainly of plant origin. The earliest known Greek herbals came from Theophrastus of Eresos who, in the 4th century BC, wrote in Greek Historia Plantarum, from Diocles of Carystus who wrote during the 3rd century BC, and from Krateuas who wrote in the 1st century BC. Only a few fragments of these works have survived intact, but from what remains, scholars noted overlap with the Egyptian herbals. Seeds likely used for herbalism were found in archaeological sites of Bronze Age China dating from the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600‚Äì1046 BC). Over a hundred of the 224 compounds mentioned in the Huangdi Neijing, an early Chinese medical text, are herbs. Herbs also commonly featured in the traditional medicine of ancient India, where the principal treatment for diseases was diet. De Materia Medica, originally written in Greek by Pedanius Dioscorides (c. 40‚Äì90 AD) of Anazarbus, Cilicia, a Greek physician, pharmacologist and botanist, is one example of herbal writing which was used for 1500 years until the 1600s. Modern herbal medicine The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80 percent of the population of some Asian and African countries presently use herbal medicine for some aspect of primary health care. Pharmaceuticals are prohibitively expensive for most of the world's population, half of whom lived on less than $2 U.S. per day in 2002. In comparison, herbal medicines can be grown from seed or gathered from nature for little or no cost. Many of the pharmaceuticals currently available to physicians have a long history of use as herbal remedies, including artemisinin, opium, aspirin, digitalis, and quinine. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 25% of modern drugs used in the United States have been derived from plants. At least 7,000 medical compounds in the modern pharmacopoeia are derived from plants. [www.ienica.net/reports/ienicafinalsummaryreport2000-2005.pdf Free full-text]. Among the 120 active compounds currently isolated from the higher plants and widely used in modern medicine today, 80% show a positive correlation between their modern therapeutic use and the traditional use of the plants from which they are derived. Clinical tests In a 2010 global survey of the most common 1000 plant-derived compounds, 156 had clinical trials published. Preclinical studies (cell culture and animal studies) were reported for about one-half of the plant products, while 120 (12%) of the plants evaluated - although available in the Western market - had no rigorous studies of their properties, and five were toxic or allergenic, a finding that led the authors to conclude \\"their use ought to be discouraged or forbidden.\\" Nine plants evaluated in human clinical research included Althaea officinalis (marshmallow), Calendula officinalis (marigold), Centella asiatica (centella), Echinacea purpurea (echinacea), Passiflora incarnata (passionflower), Punica granatum (pomegranate), Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry), Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry), and Valeriana officinalis (valerian), although generally there were inconsistent, often negative results, and the studies were of low quality. In 2015, the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance; Herbalism was one of 17 topics evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. Establishing guidelines to assess safety and efficacy of herbal products, the European Medicines Agency provides criteria for evaluating and grading the quality of clinical research in preparing monographs about herbal products. In the United States, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health of the National Institutes of Health funds clinical trials on herbal compounds, provides fact sheets evaluating the safety, potential effectiveness and side effects of many plant sources, and maintains a registry of clinical research conducted on herbal products. According to Cancer Research UK as of 2015, \\"there is currently no strong evidence from studies in people that herbal remedies can treat, prevent or cure cancer\\". Prevalence of use The use of herbal remedies is more prevalent in patients with chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, asthma and end-stage kidney disease. Multiple factors such as gender, age, ethnicity, education and social class are also shown to have association with prevalence of herbal remedies use. A survey released in May 2004 by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health focused on who used complementary and alternative medicines (CAM), what was used, and why it was used. The survey was limited to adults, aged 18 years and over during 2002, living in the United States. According to this survey, herbal therapy, or use of natural products other than vitamins and minerals, was the most commonly used CAM therapy (18.9%) when all use of prayer was excluded.Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a combination of medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.More Than One-Third of U.S. Adults Use Complementary and Alternative Medicine Press release, 27 May 2004. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health Herbal remedies are very common in Europe. In Germany, herbal medications are dispensed by apothecaries (e.g., Apotheke). Prescription drugs are sold alongside essential oils, herbal extracts, or herbal teas. Herbal remedies are seen by some as a treatment to be preferred to pure medical compounds that have been industrially produced. In India the herbal remedy is so popular that the government of India has created a separate department‚ÄîAYUSH‚Äîunder the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The National Medicinal Plants Board was also established in 2000 by the Indian government in order to deal with the herbal medical system. Herbal preparations There are many forms in which herbs can be administered, the most common of which is in the form of a liquid that is drunk by the patient‚Äîeither an herbal tea or a (possibly diluted) plant extract. Several methods of standardization may be determining the amount of herbs used. One is the ratio of raw materials to solvent. However different specimens of even the same plant species may vary in chemical content. For this reason, thin layer chromatography is sometimes used by growers to assess the content of their products before use. Another method is standardization on a signal chemical. Leaves of Eucalyptus olida being packed into a steam distillation unit to gather its essential oil. Herbal teas, or tisanes, are the resultant liquid of extracting herbs into water, though they are made in a few different ways. Infusions are hot water extracts of herbs, such as chamomile or mint, through steeping. Decoctions are the long-term boiled extracts, usually of harder substances like roots or bark. Maceration is the cold infusion of plants with high mucilage-content, such as sage or thyme. To make macerates, plants are chopped and added to cold water. They are then left to stand for 7 to 12 hours (depending on herb used). For most macerates, 10 hours is used. Tinctures are alcoholic extracts of herbs, which are generally stronger than herbal teas. Tinctures are usually obtained by combining 100% pure ethanol (or a mixture of 100% ethanol with water) with the herb. A completed tincture has an ethanol percentage of at least 25% (sometimes up to 90%).Groot Handboek Geneeskrachtige Planten by Geert Verhelst Non-alcoholic tinctures can be made with glycerin but it is believed to be less absorbed by the body than alcohol based tinctures and has a shorter shelf life. Herbal wine and elixirs are alcoholic extract of herbs, usually with an ethanol percentage of 12‚Äì38%. Extracts include liquid extracts, dry extracts, and nebulisates. Liquid extracts are liquids with a lower ethanol percentage than tinctures. They are usually made by vacuum distilling tinctures. Dry extracts are extracts of plant material that are evaporated into a dry mass. They can then be further refined to a capsule or tablet. The exact composition of an herbal product is influenced by the method of extraction. A tea will be rich in polar components because water is a polar solvent. Oil on the other hand is a non-polar solvent and it will absorb non-polar compounds. Alcohol lies somewhere in between. A herb shop in the souk of Marrakesh, Morocco Many herbs are applied topically to the skin in a variety of forms. Essential oil extracts can be applied to the skin, usually diluted in a carrier oil. Many essential oils can burn the skin or are simply too high dose used straight; diluting them in olive oil or another food grade oil such as almond oil can allow these to be used safely as a topical. Salves, oils, balms, creams and lotions are other forms of topical delivery mechanisms. Most topical applications are oil extractions of herbs. Taking a food grade oil and soaking herbs in it for anywhere from weeks to months allows certain phytochemicals to be extracted into the oil. This oil can then be made into salves, creams, lotions, or simply used as an oil for topical application. Many massage oils, antibacterial salves, and wound healing compounds are made this way. Inhalation, as in aromatherapy, can be used as a treatment. Safety Datura stramonium has been used in Ayurveda for various treatments, but contains alkaloids, such as atropine and scopolamine, which may cause severe toxicity. A number of herbs are thought to be likely to cause adverse effects. Furthermore, \\"adulteration, inappropriate formulation, or lack of understanding of plant and drug interactions have led to adverse reactions that are sometimes life threatening or lethal.\\" Proper double-blind clinical trials are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of each plant before they can be recommended for medical use. Although many consumers believe that herbal medicines are safe because they are \\"natural\\", herbal medicines and synthetic drugs may interact, causing toxicity to the patient. Herbal remedies can also be dangerously contaminated, and herbal medicines without established efficacy, may unknowingly be used to replace medicines that do have corroborated efficacy. Standardization of purity and dosage is not mandated in the United States, but even products made to the same specification may differ as a result of biochemical variations within a species of plant. Plants have chemical defense mechanisms against predators that can have adverse or lethal effects on humans. Examples of highly toxic herbs include poison hemlock and nightshade. They are not marketed to the public as herbs, because the risks are well known, partly due to a long and colorful history in Europe, associated with \\"sorcery\\", \\"magic\\" and intrigue. Although not frequent, adverse reactions have been reported for herbs in widespread use. On occasion serious untoward outcomes have been linked to herb consumption. A case of major potassium depletion has been attributed to chronic licorice ingestion., and consequently professional herbalists avoid the use of licorice where they recognize that this may be a risk. Black cohosh has been implicated in a case of liver failure. Few studies are available on the safety of herbs for pregnant women, and one study found that use of complementary and alternative medicines are associated with a 30% lower ongoing pregnancy and live birth rate during fertility treatment. Examples of herbal treatments with likely cause-effect relationships with adverse events include aconite, which is often a legally restricted herb, ayurvedic remedies, broom, chaparral, Chinese herb mixtures, comfrey, herbs containing certain flavonoids, germander, guar gum, liquorice root, and pennyroyal. Examples of herbs where a high degree of confidence of a risk long term adverse effects can be asserted include ginseng, which is unpopular among herbalists for this reason, the endangered herb goldenseal, milk thistle, senna, against which herbalists generally advise and rarely use, aloe vera juice, buckthorn bark and berry, cascara sagrada bark, saw palmetto, valerian, kava, which is banned in the European Union, St. John's wort, Khat, Betel nut, the restricted herb Ephedra, and Guarana. There is also concern with respect to the numerous well-established interactions of herbs and drugs. In consultation with a physician, usage of herbal remedies should be clarified, as some herbal remedies have the potential to cause adverse drug interactions when used in combination with various prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, just as a patient should inform a herbalist of their consumption of orthodox prescription and other medication. For example, dangerously low blood pressure may result from the combination of an herbal remedy that lowers blood pressure together with prescription medicine that has the same effect. Some herbs may amplify the effects of anticoagulants. Certain herbs as well as common fruit interfere with cytochrome P450, an enzyme critical to much drug metabolism. In a 2018 study, FDA identified active pharmaceutical additives in over 700 of analyzed dietary supplements sold as \\"herbal\\", \\"natural\\" or \\"traditional\\". The undisclosed additives included \\"unapproved antidepressants and designer steroids\\", as well as prescription drugs, such as sildenafil or sibutramine. Labeling accuracy A 2013 study found that one-third of herbal supplements sampled contained no trace of the herb listed on the label. The study found products adulterated with contaminants or fillers not listed on the label, including potential allergens such as soy, wheat, or black walnut. One bottle labeled as St. John's Wort was found to actually contain Alexandrian senna, a laxative. Researchers at the University of Adelaide found in 2014 that almost 20 per cent of herbal remedies surveyed were not registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, despite this being a condition for their sale. They also found that nearly 60 per cent of products surveyed had ingredients that did not match what was on the label. Out of 121 products, only 15 had ingredients that matched their TGA listing and packaging. In 2015, the New York Attorney General issued cease and desist letters to four major U.S. retailers (GNC, Target, Walgreens, and Walmart) who were accused of selling herbal supplements that were mislabeled and potentially dangerous. Twenty-four products were tested by DNA barcoding as part of the investigation, with all but five containing DNA that did not match the product labels. Practitioners of herbalism A herbalist gathers the flower heads of Arnica montana. Herbalists must learn many skills, including the wildcrafting or cultivation of herbs, diagnosis and treatment of conditions or dispensing herbal medication, and preparations of herbal medications. Education of herbalists varies considerably in different areas of the world. Lay herbalists and traditional indigenous medicine people generally rely upon apprenticeship and recognition from their communities in lieu of formal schooling. In some countries, formalized training and minimum education standards exist, although these are not necessarily uniform within or between countries. In Australia, for example, the self-regulated status of the profession (as of 2009) resulted in variable standards of training, and numerous loosely-formed associations setting different educational standards. One 2009 review concluded that regulation of herbalists in Australia was needed to reduce the risk of interaction of herbal medicines with prescription drugs, to implement clinical guidelines and prescription of herbal products, and to assure self-regulation for protection of public health and safety. In the United Kingdom, the training of herbalists is done by state funded universities offering Bachelor of Science degrees in herbal medicine. Government regulations The World Health Organization (WHO), the specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is concerned with international public health, published Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials in 1998 in order to support WHO Member States in establishing quality standards and specifications for herbal materials, within the overall context of quality assurance and control of herbal medicines. In the European Union (EU), herbal medicines are regulated under the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products. In the United States, herbal remedies are regulated dietary supplements by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) policy for dietary supplements. Manufacturers of products falling into this category are not required to prove the safety or efficacy of their product so long as they do not make 'medical' claims or imply uses other than as a 'dietary supplement', though the FDA may withdraw a product from sale should it prove harmful. Canadian regulations are described by the Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate which requires an eight-digit Natural Product Number or Homeopathic Medicine Number on the label of licensed herbal medicines or dietary supplements. Some herbs, such as cannabis and coca, are outright banned in most countries though coca is legal in most of the South American countries where it is grown. The Cannabis plant is used as an herbal medicine, and as such is legal in some parts of the world. Since 2004, the sales of ephedra as a dietary supplement is prohibited in the United States by the FDA,FDA Issues Regulation Prohibiting Sale of Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids and Reiterates Its Advice That Consumers Stop Using These Products and subject to Schedule III restrictions in the United Kingdom. Scientific criticism Herbalism has been criticized as a potential \\"minefield\\" of unreliable product quality, safety hazards, and potential for misleading health advice. Globally, there are no standards across various herbal products to authenticate their contents, safety or efficacy, and there is generally an absence of high- quality scientific research on product composition or effectiveness for anti- disease activity. Presumed claims of therapeutic benefit from herbal products, without rigorous evidence of efficacy and safety, receive skeptical views by scientists. Unethical practices by some herbalists and manufacturers, which may include false advertising about health benefits on product labels or literature, and contamination or use of fillers during product preparation, may erode consumer confidence about services and products. Paraherbalism An example of a herbal medicine resource: the bark of the cinchona tree contains quinine, which today is a widely prescribed treatment for malaria. The unpurified bark is still used by some who can not afford to purchase more expensive antimalarial drugs. Paraherbalism is the pseudoscientific use of extracts of plant or animal origin as supposed medicines or health-promoting agents. Phytotherapy differs from plant-derived medicines in standard pharmacology because it does not isolate and standardize the compounds from a given plant believed to be biologically active. It relies on the false belief that preserving the complexity of substances from a given plant with less processing is safer and potentially more effective, for which there is no evidence either condition applies. Phytochemical researcher Varro Eugene Tyler described paraherbalism as \\"faulty or inferior herbalism based on pseudoscience\\", using scientific terminology but lacking scientific evidence for safety and efficacy. Tyler listed ten fallacies that distinguished herbalism from paraherbalism, including claims that there is a conspiracy to suppress safe and effective herbs, herbs can not cause harm, that whole herbs are more effective than molecules isolated from the plants, herbs are superior to drugs, the doctrine of signatures (the belief that the shape of the plant indicates its function) is valid, dilution of substances increases their potency (a doctrine of the pseudoscience of homeopathy), astrological alignments are significant, animal testing is not appropriate to indicate human effects, anecdotal evidence is an effective means of proving a substance works and herbs were created by God to cure disease. Tyler suggests that none of these beliefs have any basis in fact. Traditional systems macerated medicinal liquor with goji berry, tokay gecko, and ginseng, for sale at a traditional medicine market in Xi'an, China. Africa Up to 80% of the population in Africa uses traditional medicine as primary health care. Americas Native Americans medicinally used about 2,500 of the approximately 20,000 plant species that are native to North America. China Some researchers trained in both Western and traditional Chinese medicine have attempted to deconstruct ancient medical texts in the light of modern science. In 1972, Tu Youyou, a pharmaceutical chemist, extracted the anti-malarial drug artemisinin from sweet wormwood, a traditional Chinese treatment for intermittent fevers. India A platter of herbal medicines at Goa, India In India, Ayurvedic medicine has quite complex formulas with 30 or more ingredients, including a sizable number of ingredients that have undergone \\"alchemical processing\\", chosen to balance dosha. In Ladakh, Lahul- Spiti and Tibet, the Tibetan Medical System is prevalent, also called the 'Amichi Medical System'. Over 337 species of medicinal plants have been documented by C.P. Kala. Those are used by Amchis, the practitioners of this medical system. The Indian book, Vedas, mentions treatment of diseases with plants. Indonesia Different types of Indonesian jamu herbal medicines held in bottles. In Indonesia, especially among the Javanese, the jamu traditional herbal medicine is an age old tradition preserved for centuries. Jamu is thought to have originated in the Mataram Kingdom era, some 1300 years ago. The bas-reliefs on Borobudur depict the image of people grinding herbs with stone mortar and pestle, a drink seller, a physician and masseuse treating their clients. All of these scenes might be interpreted as a traditional herbal medicine and health-related treatments in ancient Java. The Madhawapura inscription from Majapahit period mentioned a specific profession of herbs mixer and combiner (herbalist), called Acaraki. The medicine book from Mataram dated from circa 1700 contains 3,000 entries of jamu herbal recipes, while Javanese classical literature Serat Centhini (1814) describes some jamu herbal concoction recipes. Though possibly influenced by Indian Ayurveda systems, Indonesia's vast archipelago holds numerous indigenous plants not to be found in India, including plants similar to those in Australia beyond the Wallace Line. Jamu practices may vary from region to region, and are often not written down, especially in remote areas of the country. Although primarily herbal, some Jamu materials are acquired from animals, such as honey, royal jelly, milk and ayam kampung eggs. Beliefs Herbalists tend to use extracts from parts of plants, such as the roots or leaves, believing that plants are subject to environmental pressures and therefore develop resistance to threats such as radiation, reactive oxygen species and microbial attack in order to survive, providing defensive phytochemicals of use in herbalism. Use of plants by animals Indigenous healers often claim to have learned by observing that sick animals change their food preferences to nibble at bitter herbs they would normally reject. Field biologists have provided corroborating evidence based on observation of diverse species, such as chickens, sheep, butterflies, and chimpanzees. The habit of changing diet has been shown to be a physical means of purging intestinal parasites. Lowland gorillas take 90% of their diet from the fruits of Aframomum melegueta, a relative of the ginger plant, that is a potent antimicrobial and apparently keeps shigellosis and similar infections at bay. Current research focuses on the possibility that this plant also protects gorillas from fibrosing cardiomyopathy, which has a devastating effect on captive animals. Sick animals tend to forage plants rich in secondary metabolites, such as tannins and alkaloids.

History Three Bridges Road, Three Bridges Three Bridges, at first a tiny hamlet, began to grow with the coming of the London and Brighton Railway in 1841. Despite beliefs to the contrary, the village was named, not after rail bridges, but after three much older crossings over streams in the area (River Mole tributaries). The hamlet became the site of an important railway junction in 1848 with the opening of the branch line to Horsham and thence to Portsmouth. The railway established a motive power depot and marshalling yards to the south of the village. A further branch line to East Grinstead was opened in 1855. The village changed radically with the coming of the New town development in the Crawley area in the late 1940s. Three Bridges was one of the first group of neighbourhoods to be built, by 2020 they were 14 neighbourhoods.  Railway transport Three Bridges Railway Station Rail bridge at Three Bridges Station Three Bridges continues to be the site of an important rail station at the intersection of the London to Brighton line and the London to Portsmouth Line (Arun Valley Line via Horsham), but the branch line to East Grinstead closed on 1 January 1967. A rolling stock depot, Three Bridges depot, was constructed in the early 2010s for the Thameslink rolling stock programme Three Bridges ROC, the main operating centre for the south east, is also located close to Three Bridges station. Education Hazelwick School is a comprehensive school located in Three Bridges. It was opened as a Secondary Modern School in 1953, which became a Comprehensive school in the mid 1960s. It is also (since 1998) designated as a Technology and Humanities College. Hazelwick has over 110 teachers and more than 2100 pupils. Many former school pupils later became famous including Gareth Southgate and Chico Slimani. It also educated two of the controversial Fertilizer Bomb plotters, Omar Khyam and Jawad Akbar who were arrested, charged and imprisoned for life sentences due to Government Home Security surveillance during Operation Crevice. Primary schools in Three Bridges include Three Bridges Primary School.

It is the sole member of the family Sciadopityaceae and genus Sciadopitys, a living fossil with no close relatives, and present in the fossil record for about 230 million years. Etymology Its genus name comes from the Greek prefix sciado- meaning \\"shadow\\" and pitys, meaning \\"pine\\"; the specific epithet means \\"with whorls\\". Description Sciadopitys verticillata from \\"Flore des serres et des jardins de l'Europe\\" It is an evergreen tree that can grow 15‚Äì27 m tall, with brown main shoots bearing whorls of 7‚Äì12 cm long flexible green cladodes that look like, and perform the function of, leaves but are actually composed of stem tissues; occasionally, a cladode will be forked and produce a bud in the 'v' of the fork. The cones are 6‚Äì11 cm long, mature in about 18 months, and have flattish scales that open to release the seeds. Taxonomy There is inconsistent evidence regarding the plant family which produced Baltic amber. Both macrofossil and microfossil evidence suggest a Pinus relative, whereas chemical and infrared microspectroscopy evidence suggest relatives of either Agathis or Sciadopitys. History The plant was first introduced to Europe by John Gould Veitch in September 1860. It is a very attractive tree and is popular in gardens, despite its slow growth rate. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. A symbolic representation of the tree (known in Japanese as k≈çyamaki) was chosen as the Japanese Imperial crest for Prince Hisahito of Akishino, currently second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne.

The Air Force 1 was created by designer Bruce Kilgore and was the first basketball shoe to use the Nike Air technology. The shoe is offered in low, mid and high-top. Air Force 1 History The Air Force 1 (or AF1 or AF-1) was never originally called the Air Force. Bruce Kilgore designed the shoe. The name is a reference to Air Force One, the plane that carries the President of the United States. The shoes are sold in 5 different styles, low, mid, superlow, high and super high. The mid comes with a connected strap. The high-top Air Force 1s come with a velcro strap; the mid-top strap is secured to the shoe while the high-top's strap is movable and removable on some versions. Although the shoe comes in different colors and color schemes, the most common Air Force 1s sold are solid white (also referred to as \\"white on white\\"), the second most common being solid black (\\"black on black\\").\\"Top 10 Nike Air Force One colourways\\", talkbasket.net, 11 October 2016bsbaiia. Accessed 26 October 2017 Another identifying characteristic of an Air Force 1 shoe is a small medallion secured to the bottom of the laces but with holes on either side so it can be removed by sliding it off the shoe lace. The medallion is engraved with the inscription \\"AF-1\\", with the year \\"'82\\" inscribed beside it, and has historically been made out of a silver-colored metal (perhaps pewter). Its original design was more circular, but after a redesign the Air Force 1's 25th anniversary in 2007 the medallion is now rectangular. (The redesign also involved encasing the inscription in white plastic; that was discarded in favor of the original medallion material.) The Air Force 1 was produced in 1982 and discontinued in 1984. It was re-released in 1986 with the modern italic Nike logo with a Swoosh on the bottom on the back of the shoe. Little has changed to the Air Force One since its creation in 1982, although the original stitching on the side panels is no longer present in modern versions of the shoe. Since then, over 1,700 color variations have been produced, bringing in an estimated 800 million USD/year in revenue. The selling of the Air Force Ones online by certain retailers used to be prohibited by Nike who had restricted supply of the sneaker. Nike now allows retailers to offer the shoe for sale online. As a performance shoe, the AF1 is still used for street play as well as for professional play. NBA players Jerry Stackhouse (who now wears Adidas) and Rasheed Wallace have worn AF1s on court. Nike Air Force 1s were originally considered the favored shoe of inner-city youth, especially in Harlem, New York; hence the nickname \\"Uptowns\\". Rapper Nelly and his group, St. Lunatics, collaborated on a 2002 single entitled \\"Air Force Ones\\" about the shoes. The shoe is also a focus of the 2007 single \\"Classic (Better Than I've Ever Been)\\", a collaboration between Kanye West, Nas, Rakim and KRS-One, that was produced by DJ Premier The Air Force One has become a favorite of sneaker collectors, often referred to as sneakerheads. Certain rare styles can command several times their retail value. Litigation AF1 colorway Nike has vigorously defended the Air Force 1 in U.S. courts. In one case, it sued an alleged infringer of its trademark in the Air Force 1, who responded by filing a counterclaim to invalidate the Air Force 1 trademark. Several months later, apparently fearful that the defendant's counterclaim could succeed, Nike dismissed all its claims with prejudice and gave the defendant a \\"Covenant Not To Sue\\". The issue that went up on appeal was whether Nike's tactics had thereby rendered the entire dispute moot (meaning there was no longer an active case or controversy), so that the U.S. federal courts had been deprived of jurisdiction to hear the defendant's counterclaim. On January 9, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Nike's favor.Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 563 U.S. 85 (2013). Later versions The Air Force 2 shoe introduced in 1987 is a newer variation of the original. The shoe is a typical flat-soled, casual-wear sneaker that can be made in many different variations of colors. Also, Air Force 2s were re-released internationally in the early 2000s. They can be made in either the low-cut or high-top style. The shoe can be custom made in any color, but typically it has either a white or black based background with almost any color used to fill in the Nike Swoosh and back heel. The Air Force 3 introduced in 1988 was the most popular version of Air Force series. It was worn by many basketball players at the time. The Air Force III was more rugged looking and more durable than the previous two versions. The original colorway was white/medium grey/black, however several other colors were introduced shortly after. An actual \\"Air FORCE\\" logo was introduced on this model as well, with an image of half of a basketball on the tongue. This logo would be used on the rest of the Air Force series. The Air Force III was re-issued in 2006 in a very limited edition of colorways of the high top, and several colorways for the low top version. The Air Force STS (also known as Air Force 4 or Air Force IV) was introduced in 1989. It may be a reference to the Space Transportation System, the official name for the Space Shuttle. It was regularly worn by David Robinson in his rookie year. The Air Force STS features Nike's elephant print and is also slightly higher than the first three versions of the Air Force series. The Air Force 5 was introduced in 1990. The Air Force V was the first model to make the airbag visible on the side heels of the shoe. The most popular colorway was white/medium grey/black/orange. Just like the previous version it was slightly higher than the first three versions. This was also the last original Air Force model to be made. Retro versions A pair of \\"white-on-white\\" retro low-top Air Force 1s In 2007, for the 25th anniversary of the original Air Force 1, Nike created the Air Force XXV, which took inspiration from the original Air Force 1 invented in 1982. This version featured a mismatched set of medallions to commemorate its twenty fifth anniversary; one being from the original Air Force 1s with the other from the Air Force 25s. Since its introduction, many different Air Force 1 signed or inspired by celebrities and athletes. Also in 2007, to further commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Air Force One, two high-end makes of the shoe were introduced. They were hand- crafted in Italy, one from crocodile leather and the other from anaconda leather, and both were adorned with gold-tipped laces. They were sold in extremely limited quantities and had a list price of $2000, making them some of the most expensive sneakers ever to enter the marketplace. In 2009, Nike created Air Force 09, an update of the original shoe. The shoe comes in a solid black or white. In 2010, Nike commissioned DJ Clark Kent to design a Nike Air Force 1 Low pack of special limited edition Air Force 1 shoes. From 2008-2014, Jax Teller (played by Charlie Hunnam) wears his trademark white-on- white retro low-top Air Force 1s throughout Sons of Anarchy, until they are discarded in the final episode of the series. In 2016, Quicksilver (played by actor Evan Peters) uses a custom silver-colored Air Force 1 in the movie X-Men: Apocalypse. In 2017, Nike partnered with Don C, Kareem ‚ÄúBiggs‚Äù Burke, Errolson Hugh, Travis Scott and Virgil Abloh for the 35th anniversary of the shoe.

The American English versions of Oxford and Collins list the spelling with \\"t\\" first. is an expert in dietetics; that is, human nutrition and the regulation of diet. A dietitian alters their patient's nutrition based upon their medical condition and individual needs. Dietitians are regulated healthcare professionals licensed to assess, diagnose, and treat nutritional problems. A registered dietitian (RD) or registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) is a dietitian who meets all of a set of special academic and professional requirements, including the completion of a bachelor's degree with an accredited nutrition curriculum, an internship at an approved health-care facility, foodservice organization, or community agency, and satisfactory performance on a registration exam. Roughly half of all RDNs hold graduate degrees and many have certifications in specialized fields such as nutrition support, sports, pediatrics, renal, oncological, food-allergy, or gerontological nutrition. After learning about a patient's health history, favorite foods, eating and exercise habits, the RD helps the person to set goals and to prioritize. Follow-up visits often focus on maintenance and monitoring progress. Most RDs work in the treatment and prevention of disease (administering medical nutrition therapy, as part of medical teams), often in hospitals, health-maintenance organizations, private practices, or other health-care facilities. In addition, many registered dietitians work in community and public-health settings, and/or in academia and research. A growing number of dietitians work in the food industry, journalism, sports nutrition, corporate wellness programs, and other non- traditional dietetics settings. The spellings \\"dietitian\\" and \\"dietician\\" As explained by the American Heritage and Merriam-Webster's dictionaries, the cause of the confusion is that the spelling with \\"-tian\\" is an irregular alteration of the ending \\"-cian\\", which is otherwise exclusively used to refer to specialists and practitioners of other professions. These and other American dictionaries also list the spelling with \\"c\\" but list the spelling with \\"t\\" first because this spelling is more common in the United States. Nevertheless, the American publisher McGraw-Hill exclusively uses the spelling with \\"c\\" in the 2003 edition of the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific & Technical Terms and the 2002 edition of the McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. The spelling with \\"t\\" is the one preferred by the profession itself internationally, but the spelling with \\"c\\" is used often enough in texts not written by members of the profession to be considered a valid variant by both American and British dictionaries. In fact, British dictionaries list the spelling with \\"c\\" first and list the spelling with \\"t\\" as a variant. American dictionaries list the spelling with \\"t\\" first and the spelling with \\"c\\" as a variant.

This information can be found in the documentation held by ICDA > and by the International Labour Office (ILO). Recently the ILO has however issued new documents using the spelling \\"dietician\\". World Health Organization classification Dietitians supervise the preparation and service of food, develop modified diets, participate in research, and educate individuals and groups on good nutritional habits.World Health Organization. Classifying health workers. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2010.U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010‚Äì11 Edition. ‚Äî Dietitians and Nutritionists. Accessed 11 March 2011. The goals of dietitians are to provide medical nutritional intervention, and to obtain, safely prepare, serve and advise on flavorsome, attractive, and nutritious food for patients, groups and communities. Dietary modification to address medical issues involving dietary intake is a major part of dietetics (the study of nutrition as it relates to health). For example, working in consultation with physicians and other health care providers, a dietitian may provide specific artificial nutritional needs to patients unable to consume food normally. Professional dietitians may also provide specialist services such as in diabetes, obesity, oncology, osteoporosis, pediatrics, renal disease, and micronutrient research.DIETS Thematic Network for Dietetics. Improving the nutrition of Europe through a fully evidenced based profession of dietetics. Accessed 11 March 2011.Misner B. 2006. \\"Food Alone May Not Provide Sufficient Micronutrients for Preventing Deficiency.\\" Int Soc Sports Nutr; 3(1): 51‚Äì55.McGill University: School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition.

Different professional terms are used in different countries and employment settings, for example, clinical dietitian, community dietitian, dietetic educator, food-service dietitian, registered dietitian, public health dietitian, therapeutic dietitian, or research dietitian.Statistics Canada: National Occupational Classification 2006 ‚Äî D032 Dietitians and Nutritionists. Accessed 11 March 2011. In many countries, only people who have specified educational credentials and other professional requirements can call themselves \\"dietitians\\" ‚Äî the title is legally protected. The term \\"nutritionist\\" is also widely used; however, the terms \\"dietitian\\" and \\"nutritionist\\" should not be considered interchangeable ‚Äî the training, regulation and scope of practice of the two professional titles can be very different across individuals and jurisdictions. In many countries, the majority of dietitians are clinical or therapeutic dietitians, such as the case of the United States, the United Kingdom, and much of Africa. In other countries they are mostly foodservice dietitians, such as in Japan and many European countries.Hwalla N, Koleilat M. 'Dietetic practice: the past, present and future.' Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal, 2004, 10(6):716‚Äì730 http://www.emro.who.int/Publications/EMHJ/1006/index.htm Dietitians in practice=Clinical dietitians Clinical dietitians work in hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing care facilities and other health care facilities to provide nutrition therapy to patients with a variety of health conditions, and provide dietary consultations to patients and their families. They confer with other health care professionals to review patients' medical charts and develop individual plans to meet nutritional requirements. Some clinical dietitians will also create or deliver outpatient or public education programs in health and nutrition. Clinical dietitians may provide specialized services in areas of nourishment and diets, tube feedings (called enteral nutrition), and intravenous feedings (called parenteral nutrition) such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN). They work as a team with the physicians, physician assistants, physical therapists, occupational therapists, recreational therapists, pharmacists, speech therapists, social workers, nurses, dietetic technicians, psychologists and other careers to provide care to patients. Some clinical dietitians have dual responsibilities with patient nutrition therapy and in food service or research (described below). Community dietitians Community dietitians work with wellness programs, public health agencies, home care agencies, and health maintenance organizations. These dietitians apply and distribute knowledge about food and nutrition to individuals and groups of specific categories, life-styles and geographic areas in order to promote health. They often focus on the needs of the elderly, children, or other individuals with special needs or limited access to healthy food. Some community dietitians conduct home visits for patients who are too physically ill to attend consultations in health facilities in order to provide care and instruction on grocery shopping and food preparation. Food Service dietitians Foodservice dietitians or managers are responsible for large-scale food planning and service. They coordinate, assess and plan food service processes in health care facilities, school food-service programs, prisons, restaurants, and company cafeterias.Alberta Employment and Immigration: Alberta Occupational Profiles ‚Äì Dietitian. Accessed 1 April 2011. These dietitians may perform audits of their departments to ensure quality control and food safety standards, and launch new menus and various programs within their institution to meet health and nutritional requirements. They train and supervise other food service workers such as kitchen staff, delivery staff, and dietary assistants or aides. Gerontological dietitians Gerontological dietitians are specialists in nutrition and aging. They work in nursing homes, community- based aged care agencies, government agencies in aging policy, and in higher education in the field of gerontology (the study of aging). Neonatal dietitians Neonatal dietitians provide individualized medical nutrition therapy for critically ill premature newborns. They are considered a part of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit's medical team. The neonatal dietitian performs clinical assessment of patients, designs nutrition protocols and quality improvement initiatives with the medical team, develops enteral and parenteral regimens, helps establish and promote lactation/breastfeeding guidelines and often oversees the management of infection prevention in the handling, storage, and delivery of nutritional products. Pediatric dietitians Pediatric dietitians provide nutrition and health advice for infants, children, and adolescents. They focus on early nutritional needs, and often work closely with doctors, school health services, clinics, hospitals and government agencies, in developing and implementing treatment plans for children with eating disorders, food allergies, or any condition where a child's diet factors into the equation, such as childhood obesity.PediatricDietician.net . Accessed 14 March 2011. Research dietitians Research dietitians may focus on social sciences or health services research, for example, investigate the impact of health policies or behaviour change, or evaluate program effectiveness. They may survey food- service systems management in order to guide quality improvement. Some research dietitians study the biochemical aspects of nutrient interaction within the body.de Jong N et al. 'Functional Biochemical and Nutrient Indices in Frail Elderly People Are Partly Affected by Dietary Supplements but Not by Exercise.' Journal of Nutrition 1999;129:2028‚Äì2036. In universities, they also may have teaching responsibilities. Some clinical dietitians' roles involve research in addition to their patients care workload. Administrative dietitians Administrative or management dietitians oversee and direct all aspects of clinical dietetics service, food policy and/or large-scale meal service operations in hospitals, government agencies, company cafeterias, prisons, and schools. They recruit, train and supervise employees of dietetics departments including dietitians and other personnel. They set department goals, policies and procedures; procurement, equipment and supplies; ensure safety and sanitation standards in foodservice; and administer budget management. Business dietitians Business dietitians serve as resource people in food and nutrition through business, marketing and communications.Dietitians in Business and Communications (DBC) ‚Äì dietetic practice group of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Accessed 13 July 2012. Dietitians' expertise in nutrition is often solicited in the media ‚Äî for example providing expert guest opinion on television and radio news or cooking shows, columnist for a newspaper or magazine, or resource for restaurants on recipe development and critique. Business dietitians may author books or corporate newsletters on nutrition and wellness. They also work as sales representatives for food manufacturing companies that provide nutritional supplements and tube feeding supplies. Consultant dietitians Consultant dietitians are those who are in private practice or practice on a contractual basis with health care facilities or corporations, such as used in Australia, Canada and the United States. Consultant dietitians contract independently to provide nutrition or health related consultation and educational programs to individuals and health care facilities as well as sports teams, fitness clubs, and other health related businesses and corporations. Required qualifications and professional associations In most countries, competent performance as a dietitian requires formal training at a higher educational institution in dietetics involvingfood and nutritional science, nutrition education and medical nutrition therapy. Their education in health science involves scientific based knowledge in anatomy, chemistry, biochemistry, biology, and physiology. While the specific academic and professional requirements to becoming a fully qualified dietitian differ across countries and jurisdictions, as these are adapted to the needs of the individual countries and the opportunities available, common academic routes include: *A bachelor degree in Dietetics which requires four years of special studies such as anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, biochemistry/metabolism,biology, microbiology,organic chemistry, Nutritional Sciences, Food Science, Medical Nutrition Therapy,etc; or *A bachelor of science degree and a postgraduate diploma or master's degree in Dietetics. In addition, clinical/medical dietitians are required to undergo an internship in a hospital to learn counseling skills with patients and aspects of psychology. The internship process differs across countries and jurisdictions. Associations for dietetics professionals exist in many countries on every continent. Australia Accredited Practising Dietitians (APDs) in Australia gain their qualifications through university courses accredited by Dietitians Australia (DA). In order for patients to receive a rebate from the national Medicare system or private health insurance, APD status is required. APDs are Dietitians engaged in the Continuing Professional Development program offered by the DA and commit to upholding the DA Code of Professional Conduct and Code of Ethics. Dietitians who are not members of DA may participate in the DA's Continuing Professional Development Program and in this way can still hold APD status. However, health care providers must, as of 2009, either have statutory registration or be members of their national professional association to obtain a provider number. This means all private health funds will require private practitioners applying for provider numbers to be Dietitians Australia members (not just ‚Äòeligible‚Äô for membership). Canada In Canada, 'Dietitian' is a protected professional title. Additionally, 'Registered Dietitian' and 'Professional Dietitian' are protected in some provinces. Each province has an independent professional college (for example, The College of Dietitians of Ontario).The College of Dietitians of Ontario Accessed 1 April 2011.) which is responsible for protecting the public and regulating the profession. The colleges are entirely funded from licensing fees collected from dietitians. Each college must have both public and professional members, and is empowered to investigate and censure (when malpractice/negligence is found) members of the profession who breach either their scope of practice or harm/endanger the health of a patient/client, and receive a complaint against them from a member of the public or another health care professional. To practice as a registered dietitian within a province, a dietitian must register with the college and obtain a license. The activities of the college are governed by legislation passed by the provincial government. It is the presence of this regulatory body which distinguishes registered dietitians from nutritionists in Canada, the regulations for which vary by province (Exceptions: Alberta where \\"Registered Nutritionist\\" is a protected title that can only be used by dietitians. Similarly in Nova Scotia and Qu√©bec \\"Nutritionist\\" is protected and can only be used by dietitians)Dietitians of Canada: Dietitians promote health through food and nutrition Accessed 3 August 2015 The colleges also set the minimum entry requirements for admission into practice as a registered dietitian. Requirements to entry into practice as a dietitian include a four- year undergraduate degree from an accredited university (which includes courses in science, foods, nutrition, management, communication and psychology/sociology, among others), a 10‚Äì12 month supervised practice period (called an internship), and successfully passing a board exam in nutrition and dietetics.Dietitians of Canada: Become a Dietitian: Education Accessed 3 August 2015 The national professional association in Canada is Dietitians of Canada. South Africa In South Africa, dietitians must be registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa.Health Professions Council of South Africa: Dietetics and Nutrition Professional Board. Accessed 1 April 2011. The council regulates the following professional titles: Dietitians, Supplementary Dietitians, and Student Dietitians, as well as Nutritionists, Supplementary Nutritionists, and Student nutritionists. Requirements for eligibility for registration include a recognised bachelor's degree in dietetics or nutrition from an accredited educational institution. The undergraduate training should include the three practice areas of therapeutic nutrition, community nutrition, and food service management. Against the backdrop of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa, there remains high demand for greater numbers of practicing dietitians, along with other health care staff, in order to expand public sector health care services.van Rensburg DHCJ et al. 'Human resource development and antiretroviral treatment in Free State province, South Africa.' Human Resources for Health, 2008; 6:15 http://www.human-resources-health.com/content/6/1/15 Academic programs, professional associations, and credentialing requirements do not exist for dietitians in most other African countries, where the number of professionals in dietetics is very low. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, dietitians must be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC, formerly the Health Professions Council, HPC) in order to be able to work for the National Health Service. The education requirements include obtaining either a BSc in dietetics or a postgraduate qualification approved by the HCPC. United States In the United States, nutrition professionals include the dietitian or registered dietitian (RD), as well as \\"dietetic technician\\" or \\"dietetic technician, registered\\" (DTR) (see below). These terms are legally protected, regulated by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics which registers and confers professional credentials. The Academy also recognizes and certifies certain specialty areas, such as in Gerontological Nutrition. Dietitians are registered with the Commission on Dietetic Registration (the certifying agency of the Academy) and are only able to use the label \\"Registered Dietitian\\" when they have met specific educational and professional prerequisites and passed a national registration examination. Besides academic education, dietitians must complete at least 1200 hours of practical, supervised experience through an accredited program before they can sit for the registration examination. In a coordinated program, students acquire internship hours concurrently with their coursework. In a didactic program, these hours are obtained through a dietetic internship that is completed after obtaining a degree.Become an RD or DTR. Accessed 12 July 2012. In both programs the student is required to complete several areas of competency including rotations in clinical, community, long-term care nutrition as well as food service, public health and a variety of other worksites. Once the degree is earned, the internship completed, and registration examination passed, the individual can use the nationally recognized legal title, \\"Registered Dietitian\\", and is able to work in a variety of professional settings. To maintain the RD credential, professionals must participate in and earn continuing education units (often 75 hours every 5 years). In addition, many states require specific licensure to work in most settings. For instance, the California Business and Professions Code Section 2585-2586.8,Justia.com US Law: California Business and Professions Code Section 2585-2586.8 ‚Äî Chapter 5.65. Dietitians. Accessed 11 March 2011. states that: Any person representing himself or herself as a registered dietitian shall meet one of the following qualifications: #Been granted, prior to January 1, 1981, the right to use the term \\"registered dietitian\\" by a public or private agency or institution recognized by the State Department of Health Services as qualified to grant the title, provided that person continues to meet all requirements and qualifications periodically prescribed by the agency or institution for the maintenance of that title. #Possess all of the following qualifications: ::(A) Be 18 years of age or older. ::(B) Satisfactory completion of appropriate academic requirements for the field of dietetics and related disciplines and receipt of a baccalaureate or higher degree from a college or university accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges or other regional accreditation agency. ::(C) Satisfactory completion of a program of supervised practice for a minimum of 1200 hours that is designed to prepare entry level practitioners through instruction and assignments in a clinical setting. Supervisors of the program shall meet minimum qualifications established by public or private agencies or institutions recognized by the State Department of Health Services to establish those qualifications. ::(D) Satisfactory completion of an examination administered by a public or private agency or institution recognized by the State Department of Health Services as qualified to administer the examinations. ::(E) Satisfactory completion of continuing education requirements established by a public or private agency or institution recognized by the State Department of Health Services to establish the requirements. In addition: It is a misdemeanor for any person not meeting the criteria... in connection with his or her name or place of business, the words \\"dietetic technician, registered,\\" \\"dietitian,\\" \\"dietician,\\" \\"registered dietitian,\\" \\"registered dietician,\\" or the letters \\"RD,\\" \\"DTR,\\" or any other words, letters, abbreviations, or insignia indicating or implying that the person is a dietitian, or dietetic technician, registered or registered dietitian, or to represent, in any way, orally, in writing, in print or by sign, directly or by implication, that he or she is a dietitian or a dietetic technician, registered or a registered dietitian. As recent studies have shown the importance of diet in both disease prevention and management, many US states have moved towards covering medical nutrition therapy under the Medicaid/Medicare social insurance programs, making dietetics a much more lucrative profession due to insurance reimbursement. In the United States the \\"governing body\\" of Dietetics practice is the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the ADA). This group is made up of approximately 72,000 members nationwide who support each other and develop their Professional Portfolio together. International Confederation of Dietetic Associations (ICDA) The International Confederation of Dietetic Associations (ICDA) is a membership organization of over 40 national associations of Dietitians and Nutritionists. Dietetics associations are professional societies whose members have education qualifications in food, nutrition and dietetics recognized by a national authority.International Confederation of Dietetic Associations. Accessed 5 April 2011. The ICDA supports national dietetics associations and their members, beyond national and regional boundaries, by providing: * An integrated communications system * An enhanced image for the profession * Increased awareness of standards of education, training and practice in dietetics. Other nutrition personnel These titles are general designations of nutrition personnel. Specific titles may vary across countries, jurisdictions and employment settings. In particular the title nutritionist is, in some countries, unregulated so anyone may claim to be a nutritionist. Dietetic technicians Dietetic technicians are involved in planning, implementing and monitoring nutritional programs and services in facilities such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. They assist in education and assessment of clients' dietary needs, and may specialize in nutritional care or foodservice management. Dietetic technicians usually work with, and under the supervision of, a registered dietitian.U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Occupational Employment Statistics: Dietetic Technicians.

The training requirements and professional regulation of dietetic technicians vary across countries, but usually include some formal (postsecondary) training in dietetics and nutrition care. In jurisdictions where the profession is regulated, such as in the United States, the title \\"Dietetic Technician, Registered\\" (DTR) may be used. =Canada= In Canada, there are national standards for academic training and qualifications for dietetic technicians, according to CSNM (the Canadian Society for Nutrition Management). In Ontario, Conestoga College offers a diploma program with a clinical focus for dietetic technicians.Conestoga College. In British Columbia, Langara College of Vancouver offers a diploma program for dietetic technicians with a focus on foodservice management. Also the Canadian Healthcare Association, based out of Ottawa, offers a certificate in foodservice management for diet technicians. Program Details: Dietetic Technician. Accessed 2 August 2011. =United States= In the United States, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics confers the \\"Dietetic Technician, Registered\\" (DTR) credentials. Qualified DTRs possess a specialized associate degree from community college programs which are accredited by the Academy's Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education (ACEND). They must complete a dietetic internship with a minimum of 450 supervised practice hours in the areas of Food Service Theory and Management, Community Dietetics, and Clinical Dietetics. They must also pass a national registration examination administered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) of the Academy. The DTR is an Academy-credentialed nutrition practitioner who works independently in many nutrition settings; however, when performing clinical dietetics, they must work under the supervision of a Registered Dietitian. Some states have legislation specifying the scope of practice for the DTR in medical nutrition therapy settings. Effective June 1, 2009, a new pathway to becoming a Registered Dietetic Technician has been made available by the Commission on Dietetic Registration. Students may take the DTR examination without attending an internship after completion of a Baccalaureate degree granted by a US regionally accredited college/university, or foreign equivalent, and completion of an ACEND Didactic Program in Dietetics or Coordinated Program in Dietetics. Applicants must take and pass the CDR Dietetic Technician Registration Exam to qualify for the DTR credential.Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) , the credentialing agency for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. As for Registered Dietitians, in many cases the title \\"Dietetic Technician\\" is regulated by individual states. For instance, according to the California Business and Professions Code Section 2585-2586.8: Any person representing himself or herself as a dietetic technician, registered shall possess all of the following qualifications: :(1) Be 18 years of age or older. :(2) Satisfactory completion of appropriate academic requirements and receipt of an associate's degree or higher from a college or university accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges or other regional accreditation agency. :(3) Satisfactory completion of the dietetic technician program requirements by an accredited public or private agency or institution recognized by the State Department of Health Services including not less than 450 hours of supervised practice. :(4) Satisfactory completion of an examination administered by a public or private agency or institution recognized by the State Department of Health Services to administer the examination. :(5) Satisfactory completion of continuing education requirements established by a public or private agency or institution recognized by the State Department of Health Services to establish the requirements. Dietary assistants Dietary assistants, also known as \\"nutrition assistants\\" or \\"dietary aides\\", assist dietitians and other nutrition professionals to maintain nutritional care for patients and groups with special dietary needs. They assist in preparing food in hospitals, childcare centres, and aged care facilities.Government of South Australia. TAFE South Australia: Nutrition Assistant (Dietary Aide). Accessed 2 August 2011. Dietary aides in some countries might also carry out a simple initial health screening for newly admitted patients in medical facilities, and inform the dietitian if any screened patients requires a dietitian's expertise for further assessments or interventions. Dietary clerks Dietary clerks, also sometimes known as \\"medical diet clerks\\" or \\"dietary workers\\", prepare dietary information for use by kitchen personnel in preparation of foods for hospital patients following standards established by a dietitian. They examine diet orders, prepare meal trays, maintain the storage area for food supplies, and ensure practice of sanitary procedures. They may operate computers to enter and retrieve data on patients' caloric requirements and intake, or to track financial information. Dietary workers are typically trained on the job.CBsalary.

He has played in the National Football League (NFL) for 24 seasons with the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts. Considered one of the greatest kickers in league history, he is the NFL's all- time leading scorer at 2,673 points. He also holds the NFL records for most field goals made (599), most postseason points (238), and most overtime field goals made (12). Vinatieri joined the Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 1996, where he played 10 seasons, and was a member of the Colts for 14 seasons. A four-time Super Bowl winner - three with the Patriots and one with the Colts - he has the most Super Bowl wins by a kicker. He is also the only player to score 1,000 points for two different teams. , at 47 years old, Vinatieri is the oldest active player in the NFL, the third oldest of all time (behind Morten Andersen and George Blanda), and the only remaining active player whose career began in the 1990s. Celebrated for his kicking accuracy and success under pressure, Vinatieri has converted several of the most crucial field goals in NFL history. During the 2001‚Äì02 NFL playoffs, he completed the game-tying and winning kicks of New England's AFC Divisional Playoff game in blizzard conditions and the game-winning kick in the final seconds of Super Bowl XXXVI, earning the Patriots their first championship. He would again convert a final-second kick to win Super Bowl XXXVIII, establishing himself as a key contributor of the Patriots' sports dynasty. In 2019, Vinatieri was named to the National Football League 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Early years Vinatieri was born in Yankton, South Dakota, on December 28, 1972, the second of Judy M. (Goeken) and Paul Vinatieri's four children. His great-great-grandfather was Italian, and his other ancestry includes German and English. His younger brother Beau was a placekicker at Black Hills State University before graduating in 2003. When Vinatieri was five years old, his family moved to Rapid City, South Dakota. As a child, he struggled to read and enrolled in classes for children with learning disabilities. Vinatieri attended Central High School in Rapid City and was a letterman in football, wrestling, basketball, soccer, and track. In football, he earned first team All-State honors as a senior. He graduated from Central High School in 1991. Before starting as a kicker, Vinatieri was a quarterback and middle linebacker. When asked why he no longer played one of those positions, he replied, \\"I'm 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, and unfortunately the linebackers [in college] aren't that small, and neither are the quarterbacks.\\" College career Vinatieri first enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point but only lasted two weeks, before deciding to return home, where he then enrolled in South Dakota State University. He was a four- year letterman there as a placekicker and punter and he finished his collegiate career as SDSU's all-time leading scorer with 185 career points as well as being awarded first-team all-conference honors in each of his seasons. Professional career=Amsterdam Admirals Vinatieri spent the fall of 1995 training to compete professionally. He received a tryout for the World League of American Football (later rebranded as NFL Europe), and earned a roster position with the Amsterdam Admirals as a placekicker and punter. New England Patriots (1996‚Äì2005)1996‚Äì2000: early years= In 1996, Vinatieri was signed by the Patriots as an undrafted free agent to be a placekicker. He played in New England for the first 10 years of his NFL career, during which he played in four Super Bowls, winning three titles. In his rookie season, he chased down and tackled Dallas Cowboys returner Herschel Walker on a kickoff, leading then-Patriots head coach Bill Parcells to tell his rookie kicker \\"You're not a kicker‚Äîyou're a football player.\\" His first Super Bowl appearance was in his rookie season of 1996, when he played with the Patriots in their 35‚Äì21 loss to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI. One of his kickoffs in the Super Bowl was returned by Desmond Howard for a Super Bowl-record 99 yards and a touchdown that ended the Patriots' bid for a comeback. =2001‚Äì2004: three Super Bowls= In the 2001 playoffs, during a blizzard against the Oakland Raiders in the final game at Foxboro Stadium, Vinatieri kicked a 45-yard field goal into a swirling winter wind to tie the game 13‚Äì13 and send it into overtime. The Patriots won the game on another field goal of 23 yards by Vinatieri. In Super Bowl XXXVI that season, Vinatieri kicked a 48-yard field goal on the final play to give the New England Patriots their first Super Bowl victory, a 20‚Äì17 upset win over the St. Louis Rams, who were 14-point favorites coming into the game. Two years later in the 2003 season, in an almost identical situation, he kicked a 41-yard field goal with four seconds left in Super Bowl XXXVIII to boost the Patriots to another championship (after missing one field goal and having another attempt blocked in the first half). This time, the Patriots defeated the Carolina Panthers 32‚Äì29, making Vinatieri the first player ever to be the deciding factor in two Super Bowl games (Vinatieri kept the balls used on both of these kicks). Vinatieri warming up during the pre-game of Super Bowl XXXIX In 2004, Vinatieri led the NFL in scoring with 141 points (31-for-33 on field goals, and a perfect 48-for-48 on extra point attempts). In a game against the St. Louis Rams, Vinatieri scored 16 points (four field goals and four extra points), and threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Troy Brown on a fake field goal attempt (that pass gives him a career passer rating of 122.9). In Week 10, against the Buffalo Bills, he scored a career-high 17 points on five field goals and two extra points. He went on to score a field goal and three extra points in the Patriots 24‚Äì21 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX. =2005 season= By the time Vinatieri finished his final season with the Patriots in 2005, he had kicked 18 game-winning field goals with less than one minute remaining, including the postseason. At the conclusion of the 2005 season, he had a career field goal percentage of 81.9 percent (263/321), fifth highest in NFL history. In his time in New England, his community involvement included helping Christian athletes, D.A.R.E., and the Governor's Highway Safety Bureau. He was a spokesperson for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island's teen anti-smoking contest, and also appeared in commercials for Boston-based pizza Papa Gino's. Vinatieri finished his 10 seasons with the Patriots as the team's all-time leading scorer with 1,156 points (that record was surpassed by Vinatieri's replacement, Stephen Gostkowski, in 2014). His jersey number 4 was not reissued for the next 14 seasons until quarterback Jarrett Stidham wore it in 2019. Indianapolis Colts (2006‚Äì2019)2006 season: fourth Super Bowl= Vinatieri's Colt jersey at the Pro Football Hall of Fame After the 2005 season, the Patriots chose not to place the franchise tag on Vinatieri as they had the year before, allowing him to become a free agent. He had visited with the Green Bay Packers, but was set on signing in either a warm-weather climate or a team that played home games in a dome. On March 22, 2006, Vinatieri signed with the Indianapolis Colts, replacing Mike Vanderjagt, who signed with the Dallas Cowboys. Vinatieri was signed to a five-year contract and received a $3.5 million signing bonus. \\"When the Colts called, I told my agent, 'Let's not screw around,' \\" said Vinatieri, in his first extensive comments regarding his departure from New England. \\"I told him, 'If Indy is interested, let's get this done.'\\" Vinatieri said he has no regrets about not giving the Patriots a chance to counter the offer. With the Indianapolis Colts, Vinatieri had been a perfect 10-of-10 in kicks in the RCA Dome. In the second round of the 2006 AFC playoffs, Vinatieri kicked five field goals in the Colts' 15‚Äì6 upset of the favored Baltimore Ravens. The Colts reached Super Bowl XLI after defeating the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game. It was Vinatieri's fifth Super Bowl appearance, and his first with the Colts. The Colts defeated the Chicago Bears by a score of 29‚Äì17. Vinatieri was 3 for 4 on field goals, and 1 for 2 on points after touchdowns, the miss when punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the snap on the extra-point attempt after the Colts' first offensive touchdown. He missed a 36-yard kick wide left at the end of the first half‚Äîthe third time he had missed a kick in the Super Bowl. Super Bowl XLI was Vinatieri's fourth Super Bowl victory. Vinatieri finished the 2006‚Äì07 postseason with 49 total points and 14 field goals, both NFL records. He is the only player to have 3 or more field goals in 4 consecutive postseason games. =2007‚Äì2009: records and injury= During the 2007 season, Vinatieri appeared in all 16 games and was 23-of-29 on field goals (FGs) and 49‚Äìof‚Äì51 PATs for 118 points (both missed PATs were blocked). This season marked his 12th consecutive 100+ point season. He kicked his 20th career game-winning FG in the final minute of a 4th quarter or in overtime, this time with three seconds remaining against the Kansas City Chiefs on November 18, 2007. In the postseason that year, Vinatieri extended his NFL career postseason records in field goals (41), attempts (50), points (172) and consecutive games scoring (22). During the 2008 season, Vinatieri appeared in 16 games and was 20-of-25 FGs and 43-of-43 PATs for 103 points, his 13th consecutive season with over (100+) points. He made a 47-yard game-winner with three seconds remaining against Minnesota on September 14, the 21st of his career. He made a 52-yard FG vs. New England on November 2 with 8:05 remaining for the deciding points in 18‚Äì15 victory and was named AFC Special Teams Player-of-the-Week. Later that month, on November 23, Vinatieri hit a game-winner with no time remaining at San Diego. The 51-yard field goal was both his longest game-winning FG and the 22nd game-winning FG of career. In July 2009, Vinatieri had surgery on his right hip to alleviate a nagging injury, but the Colts expected that he would be ready for the season. However, Vinatieri struggled early in the season and complained of soreness in his knee. Doctors found loose cartilage in an MRI, and Vinatieri underwent arthroscopic surgery during the Colts' bye week. Vinatieri was expected to miss four to eight weeks while recovering. During the season, punter Pat McAfee assumed Vinatieri's kickoff duties, something he would continue to do until his retirement after the 2016 season. The Colts signed former Baltimore Ravens kicker Matt Stover to replace him. There was speculation over whether the Colts could cut Vinatieri, but Colts president Bill Polian stated that Vinatieri would return when he was 100% healthy. Due to the injury, Vinatieri appeared in only six games for the Colts in 2009. He returned to the lineup and kicked a field goal but missed an extra point attempt in a Week 15 loss to the New York Jets, but then was inactive for the final game of the regular season as well as throughout the Colts' postseason run. Vinatieri did not play in Super Bowl XLIV, which the Colts lost to the New Orleans Saints. =2010‚Äì2015: more records= Vinatieri in 2010 The 2010 season showed a return to form after Vinatieri's injury-plagued 2009 season. Vinatieri appeared in 15 games that season. In the final game of the regular season, in which the Colts claimed the AFC South title, Vinatieri recorded his 23rd career game-winning kick in the final minute of regulation or in overtime. He was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for the second time after the game. Some other noteworthy accomplishments for Vinatieri during 2010 include: * He became the 12th kicker in NFL history to score 1,600 points in his career. * He became the seventh kicker in NFL history to score 500-plus points with two teams (850 with Colts; 1,156 with Patriots) * He connected on 26 of 28 field goals (92.9 percent) this season, the best percentage among NFL kickers that season with at least 20 attempts * On November 14 vs. Cincinnati, he surpassed Eddie Murray (who had 352 career FGs) for 11th-most FGs made in NFL history * His 129 points marked the second-most of his career. It marked the 14th time he surpassed 100 points in a season * He was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week two times during 2010. It marked twelve (12) times during his career (including 8 times with the New England Patriots) With 53 seconds left in the Colts' Wild Card playoff game against the New York Jets, Vinatieri kicked a 50-yard field goal, his third field goal of the game, to put the Colts ahead 16‚Äì14. However, the Jets later won the game on a 32-yard field goal by Nick Folk as time expired. On January 11, 2014, against the Patriots in the Divisional Playoff round, Vinatieri became the first player in NFL history to convert 50 field goals in the postseason. On March 11, 2014, Vinatieri signed a two-year extension with the Colts. In Week 13 of the 2014 season, against the Washington Redskins, Vinatieri converted a career-high seven extra-point attempts in the 49‚Äì27 win. Through Week 16, Vinatieri was 28-of-28 in field goals, and was selected to his third career Pro Bowl in December. In the regular season finale against the Tennessee Titans, Vinatieri converted his first field goal but missed on his second attempt, ending his run at a perfect season. He would finish the season 30-of-31 in field goals, and did not miss a PAT. On January 2, 2015, Vinatieri was selected by the Associated Press as the First Team All-Pro kicker, his third such selection. On May 6, Vinatieri was ranked on the NFL Network's NFL Top 100 Players of 2015 list as the 98th best player heading into the 2015 season, becoming the first specialist (kicker or punter) ever to be ranked in the top 100, as well as the oldest player to be ranked. In Week 4 of the 2015 season, Vinatieri became the Colts' all-time leading scorer and the first player in NFL history to score 1,000 points with two teams. In Week 8, he set the NFL's all-time record for overtime field goals made in a career with 10. In Week 11, Vinatieri converted three extra points and a game-winning field goal to give the Colts a come-from-behind win in Vinatieri's 300th NFL game. =2016 season= On March 8, 2016, Vinatieri signed a two-year, $6 million extension with the Colts. On October 12, Vinatieri was awarded the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week Award for the 16th time in his career, establishing a new NFL record. In Week 5, against the Chicago Bears, he tied his career-high with 17 points (five field goals and two extra points) scored in the 29‚Äì23 victory. In a game against the Tennessee Titans on October 23, Vinatieri kicked his 43rd successful field goal in a row to break the NFL record set by Mike Vanderjagt. Vinatieri was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Month for October. His streak of consecutive successful field goals ended at 44, when he missed a 42-yard kick in the Colts' Week 11 game against the Tennessee Titans. On January 1, 2017, a missed field goal in the season's final game against the Jacksonville Jaguars cost Vinatieri a $500,000 bonus. The bonus depended on Vinatieri finishing the 2016 campaign with a 90% or higher field goal rate. =2017 season= On September 10, 2017, Vinatieri started his 22nd season in the NFL in the game against the Los Angeles Rams. In Week 5, Vinatieri went 4-for-4, hitting field goals of 23, 38, and 52 yards, followed by a 51-yard game-winner, in a 26‚Äì23 overtime win over the San Francisco 49ers, earning him AFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors. =2018: record-setting season= The 2018 season was one which featured several major milestones and NFL records for Vinatieri. On February 22, Vinatieri signed a one-year contract extension with the Colts through the 2018 season. In his first game of the season, Vinatieri hit a 51-yard field goal and became the oldest player to hit a field goal of 50 yards or more. In Week 2, Vinatieri hit three extra point attempts to score 2,501 points in his career and became only the second player in NFL history to score over 2,500 points; he also moved into fourth place all time in extra point attempts with 828. In Week 3, Vinatieri connected on an extra point and 3-of-3 field goals, allowing him to tie the NFL record of 565 field goals made by Morten Andersen. In Week 4, Vinatieri hit 4-of-4 extra points and 2-of-2 field goals in a losing effort to the Houston Texans to make him the all-time leader in field goals made. He also surpassed George Blanda, moving him into fourth place all time in career games played with 341. On October 4, 2018, Vinatieri kicked a 54-yard field goal to break his own record of the oldest player to hit a 50+ yard field goal. He also surpassed Gary Anderson, moving him into second place all time in field goal attempts with 674. In Week 6, Vinatieri scored 10 points, hitting 2-for-2 in field goals and 4-for-4 in extra points, surpassing Anderson and moving into third place all time in extra point attempts. In Week 8, against the Oakland Raiders, Vinatieri scored 10 points and became the all- time NFL leader in points scored with 2,550. In Week 14, in a win over the Texans, Vinatieri made 3-for-3 extra points to move into second place all time with 860 and he also connected on a 54-yard field goal to break his own record of oldest player to connect on a 50+ yard field goal. He also became the fourth player in NFL history to play in 350 games. In Week 17, at age 46, Vinatieri broke his own record with a 53-yard field goal to become the oldest player to kick a 50+ yard field goal and moved into second place for most extra point attempts with 852. He also became the fourth oldest player to play in a game. =2019 season= Vinatieri in a game against the Tennessee Titans On September 8, 2019, Vinatieri started his 24th season in the NFL in a game against the Los Angeles Chargers. He had one of the worst games of his career, as he went 1‚Äì3 on field goal attempts and 1‚Äì2 on extra points. In that game he became the third oldest player in NFL history to play in a game and surpassed Gary Anderson for the second most games played in NFL history. The next week against the Tennessee Titans, he missed two more extra points. In week 3 against the Atlanta Falcons, Vinatieri rebounded and went a perfect 3 for 3 on extra points and a perfect 2 for 2 on field goals, including a 49 yarder which hit the lower crossbar and barely went over. The 49 yarder also marked the longest field goal ever made by someone his age in an NFL game. In week 5, Vinatieri made all four field goal attempts and an extra point in a win over the Kansas City Chiefs. With his 701st field goal attempt, he became only the second player to attempt 700 or more field goals, joining Morten Andersen. In week 8 against the Denver Broncos, Vinatieri made three field goals, two of which were from 50+ yards away, one of which was 55 yards, thus making him the oldest player to make two or more from that distance in a single game, as well as making him the oldest player to kick a field goal of 55 yards or more, in the 15‚Äì13 win. He was named the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance despite having missed a field goal and an extra point within the game. In the following week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Vinatieri missed a potential game winning field goal late in the fourth quarter in the 26‚Äì24 loss; this unsuccessful field goal attempt tied him with Andersen for the most field goal attempts in a career. In the next game, Vinatieri became the all-time leader in field goal attempts in a career. On December 9, 2019, the Colts placed Vinatieri on injured reserve after he underwent season-ending knee surgery. Vinatieri finished the year with career-lows in field goal and extra point completion percentage at 68% and 78.6%, respectively.

Pazder wrote the discredited biography, Michelle Remembers, published in 1980, with his patient (and eventual wife) Michelle Smith, which claimed to detail satanic ritual abuse. Background Pazder was born in Edmonton, Alberta, on April 30, 1936, and completed his undergraduate medical training at the University of Alberta in 1961. He received a diploma in tropical medicine from the University of Liverpool in 1962, practicing medicine in Nigeria from 1962 to 1964. Pazder returned to Canada in 1964 and completed his psychiatric training at McGill University in 1968. During his professional career, Pazder worked at two Victoria, British Columbia hospitals in addition to his private psychiatric practice. Pazder saw patients at his private psychiatric practice in Victoria until his sudden and unexpected death of heart failure in March 2004. Pazder considered himself to be a devout Catholic. As part of his church activities Pazder founded the Anawim Companions Society in Victoria to provide a day home for people in need as a result of poverty. Pazder also had an interest in African religions and religious ceremonies. Pazder and his first wife Marylyn had four children together and were married for many years, until he developed a relationship with his patient Michelle Smith. Court documents filed in the divorce proceedings indicated that between March 1977 and June 1979 Pazder disappeared with Smith (co-author of Michelle Remembers) for lengthy periods of time. In 1979 after a rejected attempt at annulment, Pazder divorced his first wife and later married his former patient and co-author, Smith. Pazder died in his home of heart failure on March 4, 2004. Michelle Remembers and satanic ritual abuse In 1973 Pazder first started treating a woman named Michelle Smith in his private psychiatric practice in Victoria. In 1976 when Pazder was treating Smith for depression (related to her having had a miscarriage), Smith confided she felt that she had something important to tell him, but could not remember what it was. Soon thereafter, Pazder and Smith had a session where Smith allegedly screamed for 25 minutes non-stop and eventually started speaking in the voice of a five-year-old. Pazder eventually used hypnosis to help Smith recover memories of alleged satanic ritual abuse that allegedly occurred during 1954 and 1955 when Smith was five years old at the hands of her mother (Virginia Proby) and others, whom Smith alleges were members of a Satanic cult in Victoria. As Pazder believed he was on the verge of uncovering a vast satanic conspiracy, he eventually would spend many hours at a time treating Smith during a 14-month period. So convinced of the problem of satanic ritual abuse, Pazder and Smith travelled to the Vatican in 1978 to alert the Catholic church about the previously unknown dangers to children posed by Satanic cults worldwide. The chronicles of Pazder's therapy with Smith and the subsequent memories she recovered were detailed in the book that they co-authored Michelle Remembers. Michelle Remembers was the first published survivor account of alleged satanic ritual abuse and was a publishing success earning Pazder and Smith a $100,000 hard-cover advance and $242,000 for paperback rights. After the publication of Michelle Remembers, Pazder was considered to be an expert for the topic of satanic ritual abuse. With the sudden development of satanic ritual abuse cases during the 1980s (likely due to the publication of Michelle Remembers), Pazder's supposed expertise was requested. In 1984, Pazder acted as a consultant in the McMartin preschool trial. Pazder also appeared on the first major news report on Satanism (broadcast on May 16, 1985), by ABC‚Äôs television series 20/20. In the report titled \\"The Devil Worshippers\\", Pazder discussed the clues that he felt indicated satanic practices. Pazder also participated in the first national seminar at which law enforcement were introduced to the satanic ritual abuse of children (in Fort Collins, Colorado, on September 9-12, 1986). Subsequently, Pazder was part of the CCIN (Cult Crime Impact Network) and lectured to police agencies about satanic ritual abuse during the late 1980s along with other speakers such as Mike Warnke. By 1987 Pazder reported that he was spending a third of his time consulting on satanic ritual abuse cases. Pazder is credited with coining the term 'ritual abuse' to describe the type abuse that Smith alleged. At a professional conference in Richmond, Virginia in 1987, Pazder defined ritual abuse of children as \\"repeated physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual assaults combined with a systematic use of symbols and secret ceremonies designed to turn a child against itself, family, society and God.\\" Pazder noted that \\"the sexual assault has ritualistic meaning and is not for sexual gratification.\\" Pazder described the perceived satanic problem as \\"The pure group of ‚Äòorthodox satanists‚Äô is never seen or identified in public, yet it is this group of invisible satanists who plant the seeds and encourage all the more visible satanic groups\\". Further investigations into the allegations made in Michelle Remembers found no evidence to support them.

The ' (; German for 'leader principle') prescribed the fundamental basis of political authority in the governmental structures of the Third Reich. This principle can be most succinctly understood to mean that \\"the 's word is above all written law\\" and that governmental policies, decisions, and offices ought to work toward the realization of this end.\\"Nazi Conspiracy & Aggression Volume I Chapter VII: Means Used by the Nazi Conspiractors in Gaining Control of the German State\\", A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust In actual political usage, it refers mainly to the practice of dictatorship within the ranks of a political party itself, and as such, it has become an earmark of political fascism. Ideology The was not invented by the Nazis. Hermann von Keyserling, a Baltic German philosopher from Estonia, was the first to use the term. One of Keyserling's central claims was that certain \\"gifted individuals\\" were \\"born to rule\\" on the basis of Social Darwinism. The ideology of the sees each organization as a hierarchy of leaders, where every leader (, in German) has absolute responsibility in his own area, demands absolute obedience from those below him and answers only to his superiors.\\"Befehlsnotstand & the F√ºhrerprinzip\\", Shoah Education This required obedience and loyalty even over concerns of right and wrong. The supreme leader, Adolf Hitler, answered to God and the German people. Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben has argued that Hitler saw himself as an incarnation of , and as the living law or highest law itself, effectively combining in his persona executive power, judicial power, and legislative power. After the Night of the Long Knives, Hitler declared: \\"in this hour, I was responsible for the fate of the German nation and was therefore the supreme judge of the German people!\\"page=37 The paralleled the functionality of military organizations, which continue to use a similar authority structure today, although in democratic countries members are supposed to be restrained by codes of conduct. The - German paramilitary organizations made up of men who had fought in World War I and been mustered out after Germany's defeat, but who found it impossible to return to civilian life - were run on the principle. Many of the same men had, earlier in life, been part of various German youth groups in the period from 1904‚Äì1913.Savage, Jon (2007) Teenage: The Creation of Youth Culture. New York: Viking. pp. 101‚Äì112. These groups had also accepted the idea of blind obedience to a leader.Mitcham (1996), p. 21 The justification for the civil use of the was that unquestioning obedience to superiors supposedly produced order and prosperity in which those deemed 'worthy' would share. In the case of the Nazis, the became integral to the Nazi Party in July 1921, when Adolf Hitler forced a showdown with the original leaders of the party after he learned that they were attempting to merge it with the somewhat larger German Socialist Party. Learning of this, and knowing that any merger would dilute his influence over the group, Hitler quit the Nazis. Realizing that the party would be completely ineffective without Hitler as their front man, the founder of the party, Anton Drexler, opened negotiations with Hitler, who delivered an ultimatum: he must be recognized as the sole leader () of the party, with dictatorial powers. The executive committee gave in to his demands, and Hitler rejoined the party a few days later to become its permanent ruler, with Drexler kicked upstairs to be honorary chairman for life.Mitcham (1996), pp. 78‚Äì79 In time, as the party expanded, it fragmented somewhat, with the northern faction led by the Strasser brothers, Otto and Gregor, and including Joseph Goebbels, holding more socialist views than the southern faction controlled by Hitler in Munich. They differed in other ways as well, including on the party's acceptance of the Fuehrer Principle. In another confrontation engineered by Hitler, a party conference was called on February 14, 1926 in Bamberg. At this conference, Hitler won over the leaders of the northern faction with his oratorical skills, and the question of whether the NSDAP would follow the was put to rest for good.Mitcham (1996), pp. 120‚Äì121 When Hitler finally came to absolute power, after being appointed Chancellor and assuming the powers of the President when Paul von Hindenburg died, he changed his title to \\"Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor\\", and the became an integral part of German society. Appointed mayors replaced elected local governments. Schools lost elected parents' councils and faculty advisory boards, with all authority being put in the headmaster's hands.Nicholas (2006), p. 74 The Nazis suppressed associations and unions with elected leaders, putting in their place mandatory associations with appointed leaders. The authorities allowed private corporations to keep their internal organization, but with a simple renaming from hierarchy to . Conflicting associations ‚Äì e.g., sports associations responsible for the same sport ‚Äì were into a single one under the leadership of a single , who appointed the of a regional association, who appointed the sports club F√ºhrer, often appointing the person whom the club had previously elected.Kr√ºger, Arnd (1985) \\"'Heute geh√∂rt uns Deutschland und morgen ‚Ä¶?'

Shop stewards had their authority carefully circumscribed to prevent their infringing on that of the plant leader.Grunberger, Richard (1971) The 12-Year Reich. New York: Henry Holt. p. 193, Eventually, virtually no activity or organization in Germany could exist that was completely independent of party and/or state leadership. Hermann G√∂ring told Nevile Henderson that: \\"When a decision has to be taken, none of us counts more than the stones on which we are standing. It is the alone who decides\\". In practice, the selection of unsuitable candidates often led to micromanagement and commonly to an inability to formulate coherent policy. Albert Speer noted that many Nazi officials dreaded making decisions in Hitler's absence. Rules tended to become oral rather than written; leaders with initiative who flouted regulations and carved out their own spheres of influence might receive praise and promotion rather than censure.

Propaganda Many propaganda films developed the importance of the . depicted Volga German refugees saved from Communist persecution by a leader demanding unquestioning obedience.Leiser (1975), pp. 29‚Äì30 altered its source material to depict its hero, Clausen, as the unwavering leader of his munitions firm, who, faced with his children's machinations, disowns them and bestows the firm on the state, confident that a worker will arise capable of continuing his work and, as a true leader, needing no instruction.Leiser (1975), p. 49 Carl Peters shows the title character in firm, decisive action to hold and win African colonies, but brought down by a parliament that does not realize the necessity of .Leiser (1975), pp. 104‚Äì105 In the schools, adolescent boys were presented with Nordic sagas as the illustration of , which was developed with such heroes as Frederick the Great and Otto von Bismarck.Nicholas (2006), p. 78 This combined with the glorification of the one, central .

Eichmann may have declared his conscience was inconvenienced by war events in order to \\"do his job\\" as best he could. In Eichmann in Jerusalem, Hannah Arendt concluded that, aside from a desire for improving his career, Eichmann showed no trace of anti-Semitism or psychological abnormalities whatsoever. She called him the embodiment of the \\"banality of evil\\", as he appeared at his trial to have an ordinary and common personality, displaying neither guilt nor hatred, denying any form of responsibility. Eichmann argued he was simply \\"doing his job\\" and maintained he had always tried to act in accordance with Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative. Arendt suggested that these statements most strikingly discredit the idea that Nazi criminals were manifestly psychopathic and different from common people, that even the most ordinary of people can commit horrendous crimes if placed in the catalyzing situation, and given the correct incentives. However, Arendt disagreed with this interpretation, as Eichmann justified himself with the . Arendt argued that children obey, whereas adults adhere to an ideology.

Parts of an organ or a whole organ can be cultured in vitro. The main objective is to maintain the architecture of the tissue and direct it towards normal development. In this technique, it is essential that the tissue is never disrupted or damaged. It thus requires careful handling. The media used for a growing organ culture are generally the same as those used for tissue culture. The techniques for organ culture can be classified into (i) those employing a solid medium and (ii) those employing liquid medium. Current progress In April 2006, scientists reported a successful trial of seven bladders grown in- vitro and given to humans.\\"Lab-grown bladder shows big promise\\", New Scientist, 2006, issue 2546, https://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg19025464.200-labgrown-bladder- shows-big-promise.html A bladder has been cultured by Anthony Atala of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. A jawbone has been cultured at Columbia University, a lung has been cultured at Yale. A beating rat heart has been cultured by Doris Taylor at the University of Minnesota. An artificial kidney has been cultured by H. David Humes at the University of Michigan.Already cultured organs to date (2011) Silk cut from silkworm cocoons has been successfully used as growth scaffolding for heart tissue production. Heart tissue does not regenerate if damaged, so producing replacement patches is of great interest. The experiment used rat heart cells and produced functional heart tissue. In order to further test applications to humans as a cure, a way to transform human stem cells into heart tissue would have to be found.Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (2012, January 27).

They then introduced human stem cells inside the pig embryo to have the human DNA fill in the gaps.Human-pig embryos created by scientists in breakthrough for organ transplantsHuman-Pig Hybrid Created in the Lab Methodology= In vitro culture Embryonic organ culture is an easier alternative to normal organ culture derived from adult animals. The following are four techniques employed for embryonic organ culture. =Plasma clot method= The following are general steps in organ culture on plasma clots. #Prepare a plasma clot by mixing 15 drops of plasma with five drops of embryo extract in a watch glass. #Place a watch glass on a pad of cotton wool in a petri dish; cotton wool is kept moist to prevent excessive evaporation from the dish. #Place a small, carefully dissected piece of tissue on top of the plasma clots in watch glass. The technique has now been modified, and a raft of lens paper or rayon net is used on which the tissue is placed. Transfer of the tissue can then be achieved by raft easily. Excessive fluid is removed and the net with the tissue placed again on the fresh pool of medium. =Agar gel method= Media solidified with agar are also used for organ culture and these media consist of 7 parts 1% agar in BSS, 3 parts chick embryo extract and 3 parts of horse serum. Defined media with or without serum are also used with agar. The medium with agar provides the mechanical support for organ culture. It does not liquefy. Embryonic organs generally grow well on agar, but adult organ culture will not survive on this medium. The culture of adult organs or parts from adult animals is more difficult due to their greater requirement of oxygen. A variety of adult organs (e.g. the liver) have been cultured using special media with special apparatus (Towell‚Äôs II culture chamber). Since serum was found to be toxic, serum-free media were used, and the special apparatus permitted the use of 95% oxygen. Raft Methods In this approach the explant is placed onto a raft of lens paper or rayon acetate, which is floated on serum in a watch glass. Rayon acetate rafts are made to float on the serum by treating their 4 corners with silicone. Similarly, floatability of lens paper is enhanced by treating it with silicone. On each raft, 4 or more explants are usually placed. In a combination of raft and clot techniques, the explants are first placed on a suitable raft, which is then kept on a plasma clot. This modification makes media changes easy, and prevents the sinking of explants into liquefied plasma. Grid Method Initially devised by Trowell in 1954, the grid method utilizes 25 mm x 25 mm pieces of a suitable wire mesh or perforated stainless steel sheet whose edges are bent to form 4 legs of about 4 mm height. Skeletal tissues are generally placed directly on the grid but softer tissues like glands or skin are first placed on rafts, which are then kept on the grids. The grids themselves are placed in a culture chamber filled with fluid medium up to the grid; the chamber is supplied with a mixture of O2 and CO2 to meet the high O2 requirements of adult mammalian organs. A modification of the original grid method is widely used to study the growth and differentiation of adult and embryonic tissues. Uses Cultured organs can be an alternative for organs from other (living or deceased) people. This is useful as the availability of transplantable organs (derived from other people) is declining in developed countries. Another advantage is that cultured organs, created using the patients own stem cell allows for organ transplants would allow the patient to no longer require immunosuppressive drugs.Growing organs in the lab Limitations * Results from in vitro organ cultures are often not comparable to those from in vivo studies (e.g. studies on drug action) since the drugs are metabolized in vivo but not in vitro.

With normal typing, suitability is determined by an object's type. In duck typing, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the type of the object itself. Example This is a simple example in Python 3 that demonstrates how any object may be used in any context, up until it is used in a way that it does not support. class Duck: def fly(self): print(\\"Duck flying\\") class Sparrow: def fly(self): print(\\"Sparrow flying\\") class Whale: def swim(self): print(\\"Whale swimming\\") for animal in Duck(), Sparrow(), Whale(): animal.fly() Output: Duck flying Sparrow flying AttributeError: 'Whale' object has no attribute 'fly' In statically typed languages In some statically typed languages such as C# and Boo,Boo: Duck Typing class type checking can be specified to occur at run time rather than compile time. Duck typing can be achieved in Java using the MethodHandle API. Comparison with other type systems=Structural type systems Duck typing is similar to, but distinct from, structural typing. Structural typing is a static typing system that determines type compatibility and equivalence by a type's structure, whereas duck typing is dynamic and determines type compatibility by only that part of a type's structure that is accessed during run time. The TypeScript , OCaml, Scala, Go, Elm, Gosu and PureScript languages support structural typing to varying degrees. Protocols and interfaces Protocols and interfaces may provide some of the benefits of duck typing, yet duck typing is distinct in not having an explicit interface defined. For example, if a third party library implements a class that cannot be modified, a client cannot use an instance of it with an interface unknown to that library even if the class does, in fact, satisfy the interface requirements. (A common solution to this problem is the Adapter pattern.) Duck typing would allow this. Again, all of an interface must be satisfied for compatibility. Templates or generic types Template, or generic functions or methods apply the duck test in a static typing context; this brings all the advantages and disadvantages of static versus dynamic type checking in general. Duck typing can also be more flexible in that only the methods actually called at runtime need to be implemented, while templates require implementations of all methods that can not be proven unreachable at compile time. Languages like Python, Java and Objective-C are examples of duck typing because it is possible in them to construct new types in runtime via reflection and inspect whether these objects implement certain methods. On the other hand, there are languages that rely on compile-time metaprogramming techniques (like C++ and its template system) and thus do not fit into the category of duck typing; instead, at some point in the compilation pipeline, all placeholder types become substituted with some concrete types specified in a particular instantiation. Even though certain type erasure is possible in them, runtime inspection is limited.

Branches of specialty include hairstyling, skin care, cosmetics, manicures/pedicures, non-permanent hair removal such as waxing and sugaring, and permanent hair removal processes such as electrology and intense pulsed light (IPL).  Cosmetology specialties =Cosmetologist Cosmetologists are trained and licensed to perform cosmetic treatments to the hair, skin, and nails. This can be expanded into multiple parts including cutting and chemically treating hair, chemical hair removal, fashion trends, wigs, nails and skin care, skin and hair analysis; relaxation techniques including head, neck, scalp, hand and feet basic massage and aroma therapies; plus ability to expertly apply makeup applications to cover or promote and can expand into further specialties such as reflexology; theatrical applications; cosmetics and others as listed below.  Hair color specialist  A hair color specialist, or hair colorist, specializes in the modification of natural hair color utilizing various application methods while using a colorant product from a professional company. In the US, some colorists are qualified through the American Board of Certified Hair Colorists. This designation is used to recognize colorists that have a greater level of competency in the industry through a written exam and a practical exam. A hair color specialist's duties might include, but are not limited to, basic color applications, like covering grey, and lightening or darkening natural hair color. A color specialist is also able to perform corrective color applications and create special effects using foiling techniques or any other advanced color application methods.  Shampoo technician  A shampoo technician shampoos and conditions a client's hair in preparation for the hair stylist. This is generally an apprentice position and a first step for many just out of cosmetology school. Shampoo technician is a part of hair course Aesthetician Aestheticians are licensed professionals who are experts in maintaining and improving skin. An aesthetician's general scope of practice is limited to the epidermis (the outer layer of skin).Milady Standards Fundamentals Esthetics Aestheticians work in many different environments such as salons, medi-spas, day spas, skin care clinics, and private practices. Aestheticians may also specialize in treatments such as microdermabrasion, microcurrent (also known as non-surgical \\"face lifts\\"), cosmetic electrotherapy treatments (galvanic current, high frequency), LED (light- emitting diode) treatments, ultrasound/ultrasonic (low level), and mechanical massage (vacuum and g8 vibratory).Milady Standard Advanced EstheticsProfessional BeautyTherapy 3rd Edition An aesthetician may undergo special training for treatments such as laser hair removal, permanent makeup application, light chemical peels, eyelash extensions, microblading, and electrology. In the US, aestheticians must be licensed in the state in which they are working and are governed by the cosmetology board requirements of that state. Aestheticians must complete a minimum 260‚Äì1500 hours of training and pass both a written and hands-on exam in order to be licensed in a given state. Utah, Virginia and Washington are the only states at this time to adopt the Master Esthetician License. Additional post graduate training is sometimes required when specializing in areas such as medical esthetics (working in a doctor's office). Aestheticians work under a dermatologist‚Äôs supervision only when employed by the dermatologist's practice. Aestheticians treat a wide variety of skin issues that are cosmetic in nature, such as mild acne, hyperpigmentation, and aging skin; therefore, clients with skin disease and disorders are referred to a dermatologist or other medical professional. Aestheticians are also referred to as beauticians within North America. Occupational hazards Many chemicals in salon products pose potential health risks. Examples of hazardous chemicals found in common treatments (e.g. hair coloring, straightening, perms, relaxers, keratin treatments, Brazilian Blowouts, and nail treatments) include dibutyl phthalate, formaldehyde, lye (sodium hydroxide), ammonia, and coal tar. Allergies and dermatitis have forced approximately 20% of hairdressers to stop practicing their profession. In the beauty and cosmetology industries, some of the products used in hair dyes and nail applications contain chemicals that have been shown to have adverse health effects for cosmetologists. A chemical combination known as the toxic trio is often part of the ingredient list in nail polish, hair dyes, and nail polish removers. The toxic trio consists of formaldehyde, toluene and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). DBP is commonly found in nail polish and is used as a binder to increase the amount of time that the polish stays on the nail. Toluene is an industrial solvent and is usually in nail polish removers. Formaldehyde can be found in a variety of beauty products but is generally found in hair straightening products and hair dyes as well as in some nail polishes. Each chemical member of the toxic trio has independently been found to have adverse reproductive effects in humans, so there concern that the presence of all three chemicals in cosmetologist supplies could pose a detrimental health risk for cosmetologists. Demographics of the cosmetology industry As a profession, cosmetology is predominantly female, most of whom are of reproductive age. There are more than one million women registered and licensed as cosmetologists in the United States and roughly several million more work as hairdressers. Among cosmetologists, hairdressers and nail technicians make up a large part of the working population. Many cosmetologists begin their careers before reproductive age and before family planning, which may put them at higher risk for reproductive health effects from exposure to workplace cosmetology chemicals. In the United States the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for public safety regarding cosmetic products and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regulates these products. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) utilizes an \\"Expert Panel\\" to review available data on cosmetic ingredients and determine whether or not chemical ingredients in cosmetic products are safe to use considering how they are currently utilized. However, this protocol is only helpful if applied to all cosmetology workplaces in the United States. An investigation carried out by the Environmental Working Group revealed only 11% of more than 10,000 cosmetic ingredients documented by the FDA were evaluated in a CIR review. Research studies have shown that although \\"toxicological considerations play an increasingly significant role in product formulation; reproductive risks are not typically taken into account. It is also known that, \\"more than 9,000 chemicals are found in cosmetic products\\". Hairdressers use a wide range of products containing chemicals. \\"Hair dyes represent the largest segment of chemical products in the hair market today. As such, they are the main source of chemical exposure among hairdressers\\". Chemical exposuresToluene Toluene is a clear, water insoluble liquid with a distinct and pungent smell, similar to paint thinners. Toluene is found in cosmetic products such as nail polish, nail glue, and hair dyes and is widely used as an industrial solvent and is used to make fingernail polishes, lacquers, adhesives, rubber, and paint thinners. It is used in the production of benzene, gasoline, nylon, plastics, and polyurethane. Toluene can be found on cosmetic labels under the names, benzene, toluol, phenylmethane, methylbenzene. Toluene enters the environment when materials like fingernail polish, paints, paint thinners, and adhesives are used. It rapidly mixes with the air and individuals who work with paint, lacquer, or dyes have greater exposures to toluene via dermal and respiratory routes. Toluene inhalation during pregnancy has led to neonatal effects, including intrauterine growth retardation, premature delivery, congenital malformations, and postnatal developmental retardation. =Dibutyl phthalate= Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is a manufactured chemical used as a plasticizer. It is used to make plastics more flexible and can be found in paints, glue, insect repellents, hair spray, nail polish, and rocket fuel. Due to its flexibility and film forming properties, making it an ideal ingredient in cosmetics and cosmetology products. DBP is mainly used in nail products as a solvent for dyes and as a plasticizer that prevents nail polishes from becoming brittle, but is also used in hair sprays, to help avoid stiffness by allowing them to form a flexible film on the hair. Dibutyl phthalate has been linked to reproductive issues in humans if the mother is exposed while pregnant and has been banned for use by the European Union and certain phthalate esters have been shown to cause reproductive toxicity in animal models. =Formaldehyde= Formaldehyde is a colorless, strong smelling liquid that is highly volatile, making exposure to both workers and clients potentially unhealthy. Both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classify formaldehyde as a human carcinogen. Formaldehyde has been linked to nasal and lung cancer, with possible links to brain cancer and leukemia. Growing evidence reveals that various popular hair- smoothing treatments contain formaldehyde and release formaldehyde as a gas. Formaldehyde is a common ingredient in Brazilian blowouts, Cadiveu, and Keratin Complete Smoothing Therapies. Four laboratories in California, Oregon, and Canada, confirmed a popular hair straightening treatment, the Brazilian Blowout, contained between 4% and 12% formaldehyde. Oregon OSHA demonstrated that other keratin-based hair smoothing products also contain formaldehyde, with concentrations from 1% to 7%. Formaldehyde may be present in hair smoothing solutions or as a vapor in the air. Stylists and clients may inhale formaldehyde as a gas or a vapor into the lungs and respiratory tract. Formaldehyde vapor can also make contact with mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or throat. Formaldehyde solutions may be absorbed through the skin during the application process of liquid hair straighteners. Solutions of formaldehyde can release formaldehyde gas at room temperature and heating such solutions can speed up this process. Exposure often occurs when heat is applied to the treatment, via blow drying and flat ironing. Stylists and clients have reported acute health problems while using or after using certain hair smoothing treatments containing formaldehyde. Reported problems include nose-bleeds, burning eyes and throat, skin irritation and asthma attacks. Other symptoms related to formaldehyde exposure include watery eyes; runny nose; burning sensation or irritation in the eyes, nose, and throat; dry and sore throat; respiratory tract irritation; coughing; chest pain; shortness of breath; wheezing; loss of sense of smell; headaches; and fatigue. Reproductive health and birth defects of the toxic trio The presence of Formaldehyde, phthalates, and toluene (the toxic trio) in the work environment play a role in the risk of reproductive health effects for cosmetologists. Studies shows that there is a significant increase in premature birth and an increased risk of pregnancy disorders when hairdressers were compared to a referent group of teachers and salesclerks where the only occupational difference were exposure to the toxic trio. Hairdressers and cosmetologists have a slightly increased risk of having an infant with small gestational age. Reproductive disorders in relation to low birth weight were examined and found an increased risk of having infant with low birth weight; three of these studies showed a significant increase. Case studies on toluene exposures have found increased incidences of urogenital, gastrointestinal, and cardiac anomalies among children of mothers who were exposed to organic solvents, such as toluene. Associations were found between pregnant women who inhaled Formaldehyd, phthalates, and toluene and adverse reproductive outcomes such as intrauterine growth retardation and premature delivery. Hairdressers report premature ovarian failure five times more frequently than women in non- cosmetologist occupations. Regulation of cosmetics in the U.S. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C; Act) defines cosmetics as ‚Äúarticles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body‚Ä¶for cleansing, beautifying promoting attractiveness, or altering appearance‚Äù. Products such as nail polish, hair coloring, straightening formulas, and shampoos fall under this definition of cosmetics. In the U.S., the FDA does not mandate premarket approval for cosmetic ingredients or products, with the exception of color. Additionally, the FDA is not legally responsible for cosmetic product or ingredient safety and does not have the authority to require manufactures to submit their safety data to the FDA. Instead, the cosmetic manufacturer is legally responsible for correctly labeling and producing their products with safe ingredients. U.S. cosmetic companies are also not required to register their product or ingredients with the FDA as registration is purely voluntary. The FDA cannot legally order a recall of cosmetic products in the U.S. even if they have been shown to have poor health outcomes. A product recall relies on the cosmetic manufacturer is completely voluntary. In contrast, the European Union requires cosmetic products to undergo premarket safety testing and requires mandatory cosmetology product and ingredient registration. In general, the European Union approaches cosmetics and their production under the precautionary principle. The EU has banned 1,328 chemicals from use in cosmetics and does not permit animal testing for cosmetics. OSHA requirements regarding formaldehyde OSHA requires manufacturers, importers, and distributors to identify formaldehyde on any product that contains more than 0.1% formaldehyde (as a gas or in a solution), or if the product can release formaldehyde at concentrations greater than 0.1 parts per million (ppm). Safety data sheets (SDS) must also accompany the product and kept on premises with the product at all times. The SDS must explain why a chemical in the product is hazardous, how it is harmful, how workers can protect themselves, and what they should do in an emergency. Salon owners and stylists are advised to look closely at the hair smoothing products they use (read product labels and SDS sheets) to see if they contain methylene glycol, formalin, methylene oxide, paraform, formic aldehyde, methanal, oxomethane, oxymethylene, or CAS Number 50-00-0. According to OSHA's Formaldehyde standard, a product containing any of these names should be treated as a product containing formaldehyde. OSHA's Hazard Communication standard (Right to Know) states that salon owners and other employers' must have a SDS for products containing hazardous chemicals. If salon owners or other employers decide to use products that contain or release formaldehyde they are required to follow the guidelines in OSHA's Formaldehyde standard. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), is responsible for inspections of worker health and safety. It is estimated 375,000 nail technicians work in nail salons in the United States. Yet in 2005, OSHA inspected only 18 nail salons because businesses are exempt from inspection if they have 10 employees or less. According to the Asian American Resource Workshop, Vietnamese nail salon workers hold 40% of nail technician licenses in the United States. \\"It's long hours, low hourly pay, and fierce competition from every corner of the block\\" and with such fierce competition between businesses, salaries are reduced even further. As a result, a majority of these immigrants are subject to low socioeconomic status; which subsequently reduces opportunity to be educated about the occupational chemicals they are exposed to in the workplace and reduces opportunity to seek health care if adverse health effects are experienced from chemical exposure. Cosmetology careers In the United States, whether planning to study cosmetology or specialize in a specific area, each state has different requirements that must be fulfilled before obtaining a license. For example, the State of Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulations requires each candidate to complete their hours through a licensed cosmetology school program where new skills are taught and learned such as hair coloring, styling, hair cutting and the usage of hazardous chemicals. After completing the minimum hours to obtain a state license, an online examination is required and is submitted via mail with other supported documentation. Bureau of Labor Statics states that the median salary for a licensed cosmetologist is $28,770 as of May 2015. Illinois Metropolitan Division Areas, Chicago-Naperville-Arlington Heights has one of the highest employment rates with an annual rate of $27,750. Being a licensed cosmetologist opens the door to becoming self-employed and working at High-End Salons. As a licensed cosmetologist, each has the option to choose which salon fits best to work in but a self-employed salon will bring more income as long as having the right business plan for it to succeed. Each candidate registering for a salon has to obtain a certificate of registration and present all required paperwork with the FEIN, Federal employer identification number to Illinois Department of Labor. However, according to The New York Times, cosmetology schools are expensive and train students for low-paid jobs that do not allow students to pay back the debt. Iowa has the strictest requirements for a cosmetology degree: 2,100 hours of instruction. The Times interviewed over twenty former students. One typical student paid $21,000 for tuition and supplies at the Iowa School of Beauty. After getting her license in 2005, she was hired at a local Great Clips, at $9 an hour. Thirteen years after graduating, she owes more than $8,000 on her loans. In contrast, an Iowa emergency medical technician certification at a community college requires only 132 hours, according to the Times. Iowa is particularly expensive, but for-profit beauty schools across the U.S. charge an average of $17,000 for a cosmetology certificate. Community colleges would be cheaper, but when Iowa Central Community College applied to the state cosmetology board in 2004 to start a program, the Iowa Cosmetology School Association and La‚Äô James International College sued, arguing that the state code prohibits public entities from competing with private entities. The community college agreed not to give certificate programs. According to The Times, the cosmetology schools have prevented efforts to lower the number of hours required for a certificate. In the United Kingdom, Typically there are two routes to training in cosmetology. An NVQ (National Vocational Qualification) is a backbone qualification designed for those starting out in the industry. Short courses are bolt-on courses that specialise into further fields of cosmetology. Both of these options allow a qualified beautician to gain public liability insurance cover. Similarly, in India, there are many beauty and wellness training academies that provide a foundation and advanced courses in cosmetology. On graduating, students in India can work as professional cosmetologists in cosmetology schools, spas and wellness centres, beauty parlours, skin clinics, cosmetic companies, film and fashion industry, or as independent cosmetologists.

She became famous in the 1950s after playing the title role in the ballet Carmen, produced in London in 1949, and went on to appear in several Hollywood films and Paris revues. She was the wife of dancer and choreographer Roland Petit, who created ballets and revues for her. Career Jeanmaire was born Ren√©e Marcelle Jeanmaire in Paris to Olga Ren√©e (n√©e Brunus) and Marcel Jeanmaire. She later wrote in her autobiography: \\"When I was little my mother called me 'mon J√©sus' which transformed into 'mon Zizi'.\\" She met her future husband and long-time collaborator Roland Petit at the Paris Opera Ballet when they were both aged nine. She danced in 1944 in the Soir√©es de la danse at the Theater Sarah Bernhardt. She became a ballerina of the Nouveau Ballet de Monte Carlo in 1946, and danced during the last season of Colonel de Basil's Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo in London in 1947. From 1949, she became the star of the Ballets de Paris directed by Petit, where she was known for her energy and passion. She created her most famous role, Carmen, to a musical arrangement of Bizet's opera. For the role, she had her hair cut to boyish shortness, which was copied by many women. The ballet was premiered in London at the Prince's Theatre in London on 21 February 1949, and the obituary in The Guardian noted: \\"Nothing as sensual as the duets that Petit created for the lovers had been seen on the London stage before.\\" The performance was taken to an extended tour on Broadway, repeated the following season. Jeanmaire first appeared as a chanson singer in Petit's Croqueuse de diamants in 1950. A chanson, composed by Raymond Cheneau, won a Grand Prix du disque. In Hollywood, she appeared in the musical film Hans Christian Andersen in 1952, with Danny Kaye and Farley Granger. In 1954, she starred on Broadway again, in the musical The Girl in Pink Tights. She returned to Paris and married Petit that year. Their daughter Valentine was born the following year, and would become a dancer and actress. Jeanmaire appeared in film again in 1956, in Cole Porter's Anything Goes with Bing Crosby, but otherwise focused on dance, including Petit's La Rose des vents in 1958 and Cyrano de Bergerac in 1959. Beginning in 1961, she made a career in revues at the Alhambra Theatre, with hits such as \\"Mon truc en plumes\\". She performed the song in a dress by Yves Saint Laurent, who became her chief designer for stage and private clothes, and a friend. The number, with twelve young men carrying pink feather fans, became a signature tune and was repeated in other revues by Petit, who produced more than 60 shows with her. Her fame garnered her press attention, and preferred seating at fashion shows, for example in a Yves Saint Laurent show in 1967, next to Elsa Martinelli, Fran√ßoise Hardy and Catherine Deneuve. Almost 50 years later, Vogue magazine viewed Jeanmaire and her peers as representing a guidepost of fashion week celebrity culture. Jeanmaire died in Switzerland on 17 July 2020.Obituary in the New York Times (21 July 2020) Cultural references Jeanmaire is mentioned in the lyrics of the song by Peter Sarstedt, \\"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?\\", in the first line: \\"You talk like Marlene Dietrich, and you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire / Your clothes are all made by Balmain and there's diamonds and pearls in your hair\\".

Her case became highly publicized due to the graphic nature of the crime, which included her corpse having been mutilated and bisected at the waist. A native of Boston, Short spent her early life in Medford, Massachusetts and Florida before relocating to California, where her father lived. It is commonly held that Short was an aspiring actress, though she had no known acting credits or jobs during her time in Los Angeles. She would acquire the nickname of the Black Dahlia posthumously (after the owner of a drugstore in Long Beach, California told reporters that male customers had that name for her), as newspapers of the period often nicknamed particularly lurid crimes; the term may have originated from a film noir murder mystery, The Blue Dahlia, released in April 1946. After the discovery of her body on January 15, 1947, the Los Angeles Police Department began an extensive investigation that produced over 150 suspects, but yielded no arrests. Short's unsolved murder and the details surrounding it have had a lasting cultural intrigue, generating various theories and public speculation. Her life and death have been the basis of numerous books and films, and her murder is frequently cited as one of the most famous unsolved murders in American history, as well as one of the oldest unsolved cases in Los Angeles County. It has likewise been credited by historians as one of the first major crimes in post‚ÄìWorld War II America to capture national attention. Life=Childhood Elizabeth Short was born on July 29, 1924, in the Hyde Park section of Boston, Massachusetts, the third of five daughters of Cleo and Phoebe May Short (n√©e Sawyer). Around 1927, the Short family relocated to Portland, Maine, before settling in Medford, Massachusetts (a Boston suburb) the same year. This is where Short was raised and spent most of her life. Short's father built miniature golf courses until the 1929 stock market crash, when he lost most of his savings and the family became broke. In 1930, her father's car was found abandoned on the Charlestown Bridge, and it was assumed that he had committed suicide by jumping into the Charles River. Believing her husband to be deceased, Short's mother moved with her five daughters into a small apartment in Medford and worked as a bookkeeper to support them. Troubled by bronchitis and severe asthma attacks, Short underwent lung surgery at age 15, after which doctors suggested she relocate to a milder climate during the winter months to prevent further respiratory problems. Short's mother then sent her to spend winters in Miami, Florida with family friends. During the next three years, Short lived in Florida during the winter months and spent the rest of the year in Medford with her mother and sisters. In her sophomore year, Short dropped out of Medford High School. Relocation to California Short's arrest photo from 1943 for underage drinking Major Matthew Michael Gordon, Jr. In late 1942, Short's mother received a letter of apology from her presumed-deceased husband, which revealed that he was in fact alive and had started a new life in California. In December, at age 18, Short relocated to Vallejo to live with her father, whom she had not seen since she was six years old. At the time, he was working at the nearby Mare Island Naval Shipyard on San Francisco Bay. Arguments between Short and her father led to her moving out in January 1943. Shortly after, she took a job at the Base Exchange at Camp Cooke (now Vandenberg Air Force Base), near Lompoc, living with several friends, and briefly with an Army Air Force sergeant who reportedly abused her. Short left Lompoc in mid-1943 and moved to Santa Barbara, where she was arrested on September 23, 1943, for underage drinking at a local bar. The juvenile authorities sent her back to Medford, but she returned instead to Florida, making only occasional visits to Massachusetts. While in Florida, Short met Major Matthew Michael Gordon, Jr., a decorated Army Air Force officer at the 2nd Air Commando Group. He was training for deployment to the China Burma India Theater of Operations of World War II. Short told friends that Gordon had written to propose marriage while he was recovering from injuries from a plane crash in India. She accepted his offer, but Gordon died in a second crash on August 10, 1945, less than a week before the surrender of Japan ended the war. She relocated to Los Angeles in July 1946 to visit Army Air Force Lieutenant Joseph Gordon Fickling, whom she had known from Florida. Fickling was stationed at the Naval Reserve Air Base in Long Beach. Short spent the last six months of her life in southern California, mostly in the Los Angeles area; shortly before her death, she had been working as a waitress, and rented a room behind the Florentine Gardens nightclub on Hollywood Boulevard. Short has been variously described and depicted as an aspiring or \\"would-be\\" actress. According to some sources, she did in fact have aspirations to be a film star, though she had no known acting jobs or credits. Murder=Prior to murder On January 9, 1947, Short returned to her home in Los Angeles after a brief trip to San Diego with Robert \\"Red\\" Manley, a 25-year-old married salesman she had been dating. Manley stated that he dropped Short off at the Biltmore Hotel located at 506 South Grand Avenue in downtown Los Angeles, and that Short was to meet her sister, who was visiting from Boston, that afternoon. By some accounts, staff of the Biltmore recalled having seen Short using the lobby telephone. Shortly after, she was allegedly seen by patrons of the Crown Grill Cocktail Lounge at 754 South Olive Street, approximately away from the Biltmore Hotel. Discovery On the morning of January 15, 1947, Short's naked body was found severed into two pieces on a vacant lot on the west side of South Norton Avenue, midway between Coliseum Street and West 39th Street (at ) in Leimert Park, Los Angeles. At the time, the neighborhood was largely undeveloped. Local resident Betty Bersinger discovered the body at approximately 10 a.m. while walking with her three-year-old daughter. Bersinger initially thought she had found a discarded store mannequin. When she realized it was a corpse, she rushed to a nearby house and telephoned the police. Short's severely mutilated body was completely severed at the waist and drained of blood, leaving her skin a pallid white. Medical examiners determined that she had been dead for around ten hours prior to the discovery, leaving her time of death either sometime during the evening of January 14, or the early morning hours of January 15. The body had apparently been washed by the killer. Short's face had been slashed from the corners of her mouth to her ears, creating an effect known as the \\"Glasgow smile\\". She had several cuts on her thigh and breasts, where entire portions of flesh had been sliced away. The lower half of her body was positioned a foot away from the upper, and her intestines had been tucked neatly beneath her buttocks. The corpse had been \\"posed\\", with her hands over her head, her elbows bent at right angles, and her legs spread apart. Upon the discovery, a crowd of both passersby and reporters began to gather; Los Angeles Herald-Express reporter Aggie Underwood was among the first to arrive at the scene, and took several photos of the corpse and crime scene. Near the body, detectives located a heel print on the ground amid the tire tracks, and a cement sack containing watery blood was also found nearby. Autopsy and identification An autopsy of Short's body was performed on January 16, 1947, by Frederick Newbarr, the Los Angeles County coroner. Newbarr's autopsy report stated that Short was tall, weighed , and had light blue eyes, brown hair, and badly decayed teeth. There were ligature marks on her ankles, wrists, and neck, and an \\"irregular laceration with superficial tissue loss\\" on her right breast. Newbarr also noted superficial lacerations on the right forearm, left upper arm, and the lower left side of the chest. Short's official Los Angeles County death certificate, 1947 The body had been cut completely in half by a technique taught in the 1930s called a hemicorporectomy. The lower half of her body had been removed by transecting the lumbar spine between the second and third lumbar vertebrae, thus severing the intestine at the duodenum. Newbarr's report noted \\"very little\\" ecchymosis (bruising) along the incision line, suggesting it had been performed after death. Another \\"gaping laceration\\" measuring in length ran longitudinally from the umbilicus to the suprapubic region. The lacerations on each side of the face, which extended from the corners of the lips, were measured at on the right side of the face, and on the left. The skull was not fractured, but there was bruising noted on the front and right side of her scalp, with a small amount of bleeding in the subarachnoid space on the right side, consistent with blows to the head. The cause of death was determined to be hemorrhaging from the lacerations to her face and the shock from blows to the head and face. Newbarr noted that Short's anal canal was dilated at , suggesting that she may have been raped. Samples were taken from her body testing for the presence of sperm, but the results came back negative. Prior to the autopsy, police had quickly been able to identify the victim as Short after sending copies of her fingerprints to Washington, DC, via Soundphoto, a primitive fax machine of the era; the prints matched those given by Short during her 1943 arrest. Immediately following Short's identification, reporters from William Randolph Hearst's Los Angeles Examiner contacted her mother, Phoebe Short, in Boston, and told her that her daughter had won a beauty contest. It was only after prying as much personal information as they could from Phoebe that the reporters revealed that her daughter had in fact been murdered. The newspaper offered to pay her airfare and accommodations if she would travel to Los Angeles to help with the police investigation. That was yet another ploy since the newspaper kept her away from police and other reporters to protect its scoop. The Examiner and another Hearst newspaper, the Los Angeles Herald-Express, later sensationalized the case, with one article from the Examiner describing the black tailored suit Short was last seen wearing as \\"a tight skirt and a sheer blouse\\". The media nicknamed her as the \\"Black Dahlia\\" and described her as an \\"adventuress\\" who \\"prowled Hollywood Boulevard\\". Additional newspaper reports, such as one published in the Los Angeles Times on January 17, deemed the murder a \\"sex fiend slaying\\". Scans available at The Black Dahlia historical archive from the University of North Carolina. Investigation=Initial investigationLetters and interviews= On January 21, 1947, a person claiming to be Short's killer placed a phone call to the office of James Richardson, the editor of the Examiner, congratulating Richardson on the newspaper's coverage of the case, and stated he planned on eventually turning himself in, but not before allowing police to pursue him further. Additionally, the caller told Richardson to \\"expect some souvenirs of Beth Short in the mail\\". On January 24, a suspicious manila envelope was discovered by a U.S. Postal Service worker: The envelope had been addressed to \\"The Los Angeles Examiner and other Los Angeles papers\\" with individual words that had been cut-and-pasted from newspaper clippings; additionally, a large message on the face of the envelope read: \\"Here is Dahlia's belongings [,] letter to follow\\". The envelope contained Short's birth certificate, business cards, photographs, names written on pieces of paper, and an address book with the name Mark Hansen embossed on the cover. The packet had been carefully cleaned with gasoline, similarly to Short's body, which led police to suspect the packet had been sent directly by her killer. Despite the efforts to clean the packet, several partial fingerprints were lifted from the envelope and sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for testing; however, the prints were compromised in transit and thus could not be properly analyzed. The same day the packet was received by the Examiner, a handbag and a black suede shoe were reported to have been seen on top of a garbage can in an alley a short distance from Norton Avenue, from where Short's body had been discovered. The items were recovered by police, but they had also been wiped clean with gasoline, destroying any fingerprints. On March 14, an apparent suicide note scrawled in pencil on a bit of foolscap was found tucked in a shoe in a pile of men's clothing by the ocean's edge at the foot of Breeze Ave. Venice. The note read: \\"To whom it may concern: I have waited for the police to capture me for the Black Dahlia killing, but have not. I am too much of a coward to turn myself in, so this is the best way out for me. I couldn't help myself for that, or this. Sorry, Mary.\\" The pile of clothing was first seen by a beach caretaker, who reported the discovery to John Dillon, lifeguard captain. Dillon immediately notified Capt. L. E. Christensen of West Los Angeles Police Station. The clothes included a coat and trousers of blue herringbone tweed, a brown and white Y shirt, white jockey shorts, tan socks and tan moccasin leisure shoes, size about eight. The clothes gave no clue about the identity of their owner. Police quickly deemed Mark Hansen, the owner of the address book found in the packet, a suspect. Hansen was a wealthy local nightclub and theater owner and an acquaintance at whose home Short had stayed with friends, and according to some sources, he also confirmed that the purse and shoe discovered in the alley were in fact Short's. Ann Toth, Short's friend and roommate, told investigators that Short had recently rejected sexual advances from Hansen, and suggested it as potential cause for him to kill her; however, he was cleared of suspicion in the case. In addition to Hansen, the Los Angeles Police Department interviewed over 150 men in the ensuing weeks whom they believed to be potential suspects. Manley, who had been one of the last people to see Short alive, was also investigated, but was cleared of suspicion after passing numerous polygraph examinations. Police also interviewed several persons found listed in Hansen's address book, including Martin Lewis, who had been an acquaintance of Short's. Lewis was able to provide an alibi for the date of Short's murder, as he was in Portland, Oregon, visiting his father-in- law, who was dying of kidney failure. A total of 750 investigators from the LAPD and other departments worked on the case during its initial stages, including 400 sheriff's deputies and 250 California State Patrol officers. Various locations were searched for potential evidence, including storm drains throughout Los Angeles, abandoned structures, and various sites along the Los Angeles River, but the searches yielded no further evidence. City councilman Lloyd G. Davis posted a reward for information leading police to Short's killer. After the announcement of the reward, various persons came forward with confessions, most of which police dismissed as false. Several of the false confessors were charged with obstruction of justice. =Media response; decline= On January 26, another letter was received by the Examiner, this time handwritten, which read: \\"Here it is. Turning in Wed., Jan. 29, 10 am. Had my fun at police. Black Dahlia Avenger\\". The letter also named a location at which the supposed killer would turn himself in. Police waited at the location on the morning of January 29, but the alleged killer did not appear. Instead, at 1:00pm, the Examiner offices received another cut-and-pasted letter, which read: \\"Have changed my mind. You would not give me a square deal. Dahlia killing was justified.\\" The graphic nature of the crime and the subsequent letters received by the Examiner had resulted in a media frenzy surrounding Short's murder. Both local and national publications covered the story heavily, many of which reprinted sensationalistic reports suggesting that Short had been tortured for hours prior to her death; the information, however, was false, yet police allowed the reports to circulate so as to conceal Short's true cause of death‚Äîcerebral hemorrhage‚Äîfrom the public. Further reports about Short's personal life were publicized, including details about her alleged declining of Hansen's romantic advances; additionally, a stripper who was an acquaintance of Short's told police that she \\"liked to get guys worked up over her, but she'd leave them hanging dry.\\" This led some reporters (namely the Herald-Expresss Bevo Means) and detectives to look into the possibility that Short was a lesbian, and begin questioning employees and patrons of gay bars in Los Angeles; this claim, however, remained unsubstantiated. The Herald-Express also received several letters from the purported killer, again made with cut-and-pasted clippings, one of which read: \\"I will give up on Dahlia killing if I get 10 years. Don't try to find me.\\" On February 1, the Los Angeles Daily News reported that the case had \\"run into a Stone Wall\\", with no new leads for investigators to pursue. The Examiner continued to run stories on the murder and the investigation, which was front- page news for 35 days following the discovery of the body. When interviewed, lead investigator Captain Jack Donahue told the press that he believed Short's murder had taken place in a remote building or shack on the outskirts of Los Angeles, and her body transported into the city where it was disposed of. Based on the precise cuts and dissection of Short's corpse, the LAPD looked into the possibility that the murderer may have been a surgeon, doctor, or someone with medical knowledge. In mid-February 1947, the LAPD served a warrant to the University of Southern California Medical School, which was located near the site where Short's body had been discovered, requesting a complete list of the program's students. The university agreed so long as the students' identities remained private. Background checks were conducted, but they yielded no results. Grand jury and aftermath By the spring of 1947, Short's murder had become a cold case with few new leads. Sergeant Finis Brown, one of the lead detectives on the case, blamed the press for compromising the investigation through reporters' probing of details and unverified reporting. In September 1949, a grand jury convened to discuss inadequacies in the LAPD's homicide unit based on their failure to solve numerous murders‚Äîespecially those of women and children‚Äîin the past several years, Short's being one of them. In the aftermath of the grand jury, further investigation was done on Short's past, with detectives tracing her movements between Massachusetts, California, and Florida, and also interviewed people who knew her in Texas and New Orleans. However, the interviews yielded no useful information in the murder. Suspects and confessions The notoriety of Short's murder has spurred a large number of confessions over the years, many of which have been deemed false. During the initial investigation into her murder, police received a total of 60 confessions, most made by men. Since that time, over 500 people have confessed to the crime, some of whom had not even been born at the time of her death. Sergeant John P. St. John, a detective who worked the case until his retirement, stated, \\"It is amazing how many people offer up a relative as the killer.\\" In 2003, Ralph Asdel, one of the original detectives on the case, told the Times that he believed he had interviewed Short's killer, a man who had been seen with his sedan parked near the vacant lot where her body was discovered in the early morning hours of January 15, 1947. A neighbor driving by that day stopped to dispose of a bag of lawn clippings in the vacant lot when he saw a parked sedan, allegedly with its right rear door open; the driver of the sedan was standing in the lot. His arrival apparently startled the owner of the sedan, who approached his car and peered in the window before returning to the sedan and driving away. The owner of the sedan was followed to a local restaurant where he worked, but was ultimately cleared of suspicion. Suspects remaining under discussion by various authors and experts include a doctor named Walter Bayley, proposed by the former Times copyeditor Larry Harnisch; Times publisher Norman Chandler, whom biographer Donald Wolfe claims impregnated Short; Leslie Dillon, Joseph A. Dumais, Artie Lane (a.k.a. Jeff Connors), Mark Hansen, Dr. Francis E. Sweeney, Woody Guthrie, Bugsy Siegel, Orson Welles, George Hodel, Hodel's friend Fred Sexton, George Knowlton, Robert M. \\"Red\\" Manley, Patrick S. O'Reilly, and Jack Anderson Wilson. Police came to consider George Hill Hodel Jr a suspect after the 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short. He was never formally charged with the crime, and came to wider attention as a suspect after his death when he was accused by his son, Los Angeles homicide detective Steve Hodel, of killing Short and committing several additional murders. Prior to the Dahlia case, he was also a suspect in the death of his secretary, Ruth Spaulding, but was not charged; and was accused of raping his own daughter, Tamar, but acquitted. He fled the country several times, and spent 1950 to 1990 in the Philippines. Theories and potentially related crimes Cleveland Torso Murders, 1936; some journalists and law enforcement have speculated a connection between the Cleveland crimes and Short's murder. Several crime authors, as well as Cleveland detective Peter Merylo, have suspected a link between the Short murder and the Cleveland Torso Murders, which took place in Cleveland, Ohio, between 1934 and 1938. As part of their investigation into other murders that took place before and after the Short killing, the original LAPD investigators studied the Torso Murders in 1947 but later discounted any relationship between the two cases. In 1980, new evidence implicating a former Torso Murder suspect, Jack Anderson Wilson (a.k.a. Arnold Smith), was investigated by Detective St. John in relation to Short's murder. He claimed he was close to arresting Wilson for Short's murder, but that Wilson died in a fire on February 4, 1982. The possible connection between Short's murder and the Torso Murders received renewed media attention when it was profiled on the NBC series Unsolved Mysteries in 1992, in which Eliot Ness biographer Oscar Fraley suggested Ness knew the identity of the killer responsible for both cases. The February 10, 1947, murder of Jeanne French in Los Angeles was also considered by the media and detectives as possibly being connected to Short's killing. French's body was discovered in west Los Angeles on Grand View Boulevard, nude and badly beaten. Written on her stomach in lipstick was what appeared to say \\"Fuck You B.D.\\", and the letters \\"TEX\\" below. The Herald- Express covered the story heavily, and drew comparisons to the Short murder less than a month prior, surmising the initials \\"B.D.\\" to stand for \\"Black Dahlia\\". According to historian Jon Lewis, however, the scrawling actually read \\"P.D.\\", ostensibly standing for \\"police department\\". Crime authors such as Steve Hodel (son of George Hill Hodel) and William Rasmussen have suggested a link between the Short murder and the 1946 murder and dismemberment of six- year-old Suzanne Degnan in Chicago, Illinois. Captain Donahoe of the LAPD stated publicly that he believed the Black Dahlia and the Chicago Lipstick Murders were \\"likely connected\\". Among the evidence cited is the fact that Short's body was found on Norton Avenue, three blocks west of Degnan Boulevard, Degnan being the last name of the girl from Chicago. There were also striking similarities between the handwriting on the Degnan ransom note and that of the \\"Black Dahlia Avenger\\". Both texts used a combination of capitals and small letters (the Degnan note read in part \\"BuRN This FoR heR SAfTY\\" ), and both notes contain a similar misshapen letter P and have one word that matches exactly. Convicted serial killer William Heirens served life in prison for Degnan's murder. Initially arrested at 17 for breaking into a residence close to that of Degnan, Heirens claimed he was tortured by police, forced to confess, and made a scapegoat for the murder. After being taken from the medical infirmary at the Dixon Correctional Center on February 26, 2012 for health problems, Heirens died at the University of Illinois Medical Center on March 5, 2012, at 83. Additionally, Steve Hodel has implicated his father, George Hodel, as Short's killer, citing his father's training as a surgeon as circumstantial evidence. In 2003, it was revealed in notes from the 1949 grand jury report that investigators had wiretapped Hodel's home, and obtained recorded conversation of him with an unidentified visitor, saying: \\"Supposin' I did kill the Black Dahlia. They couldn't prove it now. They can't talk to my secretary because she's dead.\\" In 1991, Janice Knowlton, a woman who was ten years old at the time of Short's murder, claimed that she witnessed her father, George Knowlton, beat Short to death with a clawhammer in the detached garage of her family's home in Westminster. She also published a book titled Daddy was the Black Dahlia Killer in 1995, in which she made additional claims that her father sexually molested her. The book was condemned as \\"trash\\" by Knowlton's stepsister Jolane Emerson in 2004, who stated: \\"She believed it, but it wasn't reality. I know, because I lived with her father for sixteen years.\\" Additionally, Detective St. John told the Times that Knowlton's claims were \\"not consistent with the facts of the case\\". John Gilmore's 1994 book Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder, suggests a possible connection between Short's murder and that of Georgette Bauerdorf, a socialite who was strangled to death in her West Hollywood home in 1944. Gilmore suggests that Short's employment at the Hollywood Canteen, where Bauerdorf also worked as a hostess, could be a potential connection between the two women. However, the claim that Short ever worked at the Hollywood Canteen has been disputed by others, such as the retired Times copyeditor Larry Harnisch (see Rumors and factual disputes). The 2017 book Black Dahlia, Red Rose by Piu Eatwell focuses on Leslie Dillon, a bellhop who was a former mortician's assistant; his associates Mark Hansen and Jeff Connors; and Sergeant Finis Brown, a lead detective who had links to Hansen and was allegedly corrupt. Eatwell posits that Short was murdered because she knew too much about the men's involvement in a scheme for robbing hotels. She further suggests that Short was killed at the Aster Motel in Los Angeles, where the owners reported finding one of their rooms \\"covered in blood and fecal matter\\" on the morning Short's body was found. The Examiner stated in 1949 that LA Police Chief WIlliam A. Worton denied that the Flower Street [Aster] Motel had anything to do with the case, although its rival newspaper, the Los Angeles Herald, claimed that the murder took place there. Eatwell is working on a television documentary, and a revised edition of her book is due to be released in the autumn of 2018. In 2000, Buz Williams, a retired detective with the Long Beach Police Department, wrote an article for the LBPD newsletter The Rap Sheet on Short's murder. Williams' father, Richard F. Williams, and his friend, Con Keller, were both members of LA's Gangster Squad investigating the case. Williams Sr believed that Dillon was the killer, and that when Dillon returned to his home state of Oklahoma, he was able to avoid extradition to California because his ex-wife Georgia Stevenson was second cousins with Governor Adlai Stevenson II of Illinois, who contacted the governor of Oklahoma on Dillon's behalf. Keller believed Hansen was the killer, as he had studied at a surgical school in Sweden and had thrown elaborate parties attended by prominent LAPD officials. Williams' article says that Dillon sued the LAPD for $3 million, but that the suit was dropped. Harnisch disputes this, claiming that Dillon was cleared by police after an exhaustive investigation, and that the District Attorney's files positively placed him in San Francisco when Short was killed. Harnisch claims that there was no LAPD coverup, and that Dillon did in fact receive a financial settlement from the City of Los Angeles, but has not produced concrete evidence to prove this. Rumors and factual disputes Numerous details regarding Short's personal life and death have been points of public dispute. The eager involvement of both the public and press in solving her murder have been credited as factors that complicated the investigation significantly, resulting in a complex, sometimes inconsistent narrative of events. According to Anne Marie DiStefano of the Portland Tribune, many \\"unsubstantiated stories\\" have circulated about Short over the years: \\"She was a prostitute, she was frigid, she was pregnant, she was a lesbian. And somehow, instead of fading away over time, the legend of the Black Dahlia just keeps getting more convoluted.\\" Harnisch has refuted several supposed rumors and popular conceptions about Short and her murder and also disputed the validity of Gilmore's book Severed, claiming the book is \\"25% mistakes, and 50% fiction\\". Harnisch also had examined the district attorney's files (he claimed that Steve Hodel has examined some of them pertaining to his father, along with Times columnist Steve Lopez) and contrary to Eatwell's claims, the files showed that Dillon was thoroughly investigated and was determined to have been in San Francisco when Short was killed. Harnisch speculated that Eatwell either did not find these files or she chose to ignore them. Murder and state of the body A number of people, none of whom knew Short, contacted police and the newspapers and claimed to have seen her during her so-called \\"missing week\\", between her January 9 disappearance and the discovery of her body, on January 15. Police and DA investigators ruled out each alleged sighting; in some cases, those interviewed were identifying other women whom they had mistaken for Short. Short's whereabouts in the days leading up to her murder and the discovery of her body are unknown. After the discovery of Short's body, numerous Los Angeles newspapers printed headlines claiming she had been tortured leading up to her death. This was denied by law enforcement at the time, but they allowed the claims to circulate so as to keep Short's actual cause of death a secret from the public. Some sources, such as Oliver Cyriax's Crime: An Encyclopedia (1993), state that Short's body was covered in cigarette burns inflicted on her while she was still alive, though there is no indication of this in her official autopsy report. In Severed, Gilmore states that the coroner who performed Short's autopsy suggested in conversation that she had been forced to consume feces based on his findings when examining the contents of her stomach. This claim has been denied by Harnisch and is also not indicated in Short's official autopsy, though it has been reprinted in several print and online media. \\"The Black Dahlia\\" name Some sources attribute the Black Dahlia name to the 1946 film noir The Blue Dahlia, starring Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd (pictured). According to newspaper reports shortly after the murder, Short received the nickname \\"Black Dahlia\\" from staff and patrons at a Long Beach drugstore in mid-1946 as wordplay on the film The Blue Dahlia (1946). Other popularly- circulated rumors claim that the media crafted the name due to Short's adorning her hair with dahlias. According to the FBI official website, she received the first part of the nickname from the press \\"for her rumored penchant for sheer black clothes\\". However, reports by DA investigators state that the nickname was invented by newspaper reporters covering her murder; Herald-Express reporter Bevo Means, who interviewed Short's acquaintances at the drugstore, has been credited with first using the \\"Black Dahlia\\" name, though reporters Underwood and Jack Smith have been alternatively named as its creators. While some sources claim that Short was referred to or went by the name during her life, others dispute this. Both Gilmore and Harnisch agree that the name originated during Short's lifetime and was not a creation of the press: Harnisch states that it was in fact a nickname she earned from the staff of the Long Beach drugstore she frequented; in Severed, Gilmore names an A.L. Landers as the proprietor of the drugstore, though he does not provide the store's name. Prior to the circulation of the \\"Black Dahlia\\" name, Short's killing had been dubbed the \\"Werewolf Murder\\" by the Herald-Express due to the brutal nature of the crime. Alleged prostitution and sexual history Many true crime books claim that Short lived in or visited Los Angeles at various times in the mid-1940s, including Gilmore's Severed, which claims she worked at the Hollywood Canteen. This is disputed by Harnisch, who states that Short did not, in fact, live in Los Angeles until after the canteen's closing in 1945. Although some of her acquaintances and several authors and journalists described Short as a prostitute or call girl during her time in Los Angeles, according to Harnisch, the contemporaneous grand jury proved that there was no existing evidence that she was ever a prostitute. Harnisch claims that the rumor regarding Short's history as a prostitute originates from John Gregory Dunne's 1977 novel True Confessions, which is based in part on the crime. Another widely circulated rumor (sometimes used to counter claims that Short was a prostitute) holds that Short was unable to have sexual intercourse because of a congenital defect that resulted in gonadal dysgenesis, also known as \\"infantile genitalia\\". Los Angeles County district attorney's files state that the investigators had questioned three men with whom Short had engaged in sex,\\"Fact Versus Fiction\\" BlackDahlia.info. including a Chicago police officer who was a suspect in the case; FBI files on the case also contain a statement from one of Short's alleged lovers.\\"District Attorney Suspects\\" BlackDahlia.info. Short's autopsy itself, which was reprinted in full in Michael Newton's 2009 book The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes, notes that her uterus was \\"small\\"; however, no other information in the autopsy is provided that would suggest her reproductive organs were anything other than anatomically normal. The autopsy also states that Short was not and had never been pregnant, contrary to what had been claimed prior to and following her death. Another rumor‚Äîthat Short was a lesbian‚Äîhas often circulated; according to Gilmore, this rumor began after Bevo Means of the Herald-Express was told by the deputy coroner that Short \\"wasn't having sex with men\\" due to her purportedly \\"small\\" genitalia. Means took this to mean that Short had sex with women, and both he and reporter Sid Hughes began fruitlessly investigating gay bars in Los Angeles for further information. Legacy Short's grave in Oakland, California Short is interred at the Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland. After her younger sisters had grown up and married, their mother, Phoebe, moved to Oakland to be near her daughter's grave. She finally returned to the East Coast in the 1970s, where she lived into her 90s. On February 2, 1947, just two weeks after Short's murder, Republican state assemblyman C. Don Field was prompted by the case to introduce a bill calling for the formation of a sex offender registry; the state of California would become the first U.S. state to make the registration of sex offenders mandatory. Short's murder has been described as one of the most brutal and culturally enduring crimes in American history, and Time magazine listed it as one of the most infamous unsolved cases in the world. Short's life and death have been the basis of numerous books and films, both fictionalized and non-fiction. The case was the focus of Season Four, Episode 13 of Hunter, in which the main characters, along with a (fictitious) veteran former police detective (played by Lawrence Tierney), investigated and carried out an arrest of an in-reality fictitious suspect after 41 years. Elizabeth Short was portrayed here by Jessica Nelson. Among the most famous fictional accounts of Short's death is James Ellroy's 1987 novel The Black Dahlia, which, in addition to the murder, explored \\"the larger fields of politics, crime, corruption, and paranoia in post-war Los Angeles\\", according to cultural critic David M. Fine. Ellroy's novel was adapted into a 2006 film of the same name by director Brian De Palma: Short was played by actress Mia Kirshner. Both Ellroy's novel and its film adaptation bear little relation to the facts of the case. Short was also portrayed in heavily fictionalized accounts by Lucie Arnaz in the 1975 television film Who Is the Black Dahlia? and again by Mena Suvari in the series American Horror Story in 2011, featuring Short in the plot line of the episode \\"Spooky Little Girl\\", and again in 2018 with \\"Return to Murder House\\".

CODOFIL continues to recruit and sponsor French, Belgian and Canadian associate teachers as per its accords with those countries, who are placed alongside local teachers upon LDOE's recommendation. CODOFIL encourages Louisiana Francophones to continue transmission of the state's heritage language via its scholarship program (providing opportunities for pedagogical advancement) and the Escadrille Louisiane program (which allows non-native speakers to perfect French at the Universit√© de Rennes in exchange for a minimum 3-year teaching commitment of French in Louisiana). Retrieved on August 30, 2013 CODOFIL has also worked to instill pride all Louisiana Francophones in their linguistic identity rather than to uphold one variety of French language or another.Shane K. Bernard, The Cajuns: Americanization of a People (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2003), pp. xx, xxii‚Äìxxiii, 18‚Äì19, 33‚Äì34, 83. Mission and vision CODOFIL's mission is to \\"work toward the creation of an eco-system that permits the development of French in the economic, educational, cultural and professional sectors and in which Louisiana's French and Creole speakers are valorized in their cultural and linguistic identity.\\" It seeks to \\"provide access to economic, educational, cultural and professional opportunities in French to all Louisianians.\\" Board CODOFIL originally consisted of a chairman and an advisory committee, all appointed by the governor of Louisiana. Today it is administered by a president, an executive director, and a board of as many as 23 non-paid directors. In addition to the governor, various Louisiana organizations nominate and select board members, who serve for a term of 4 years. History James R. Domengeaux, a former state legislator and former United States Congressman of ethnic French descent, was the driving force behind CODOFIL's creation. A semi-retired attorney at the time, Domengeaux began his crusade for restoring French in Louisiana after Senator Edgar G. \\"Sonny\\" Mouton, Jr., of Lafayette obtained passage of an \\"urge-and-request\\" resolution for Louisiana school boards to help reverse the decline of the use of the French language within the state. Domengeaux traveled around Louisiana to gain support for his campaign to make Louisiana a bilingual state through French language education. By the spring of 1968, Domengeaux had gained enough interest from the public and support from officials, to present his plan to the legislature. Legislators, such as J. Burton Angelle of Breaux Bridge voted to create CODOFIL, and the measure was signed into law in July 1968 by Governor John McKeithen. The law empowered CODOFIL to \\"do any and all things necessary to accomplish the development, utilization, and preservation of the French language ... for the cultural, economic, and tourist[ic] benefit of the State.\\" Criticism CODOFIL's early efforts to introduce French language education in public classrooms were criticized by many observers. They criticized its emphasis on international French instead of that common to Louisiana, and its use of Francophone teachers from France, Switzerland, Belgium, and Canada, rather than local teachers. Administrators were said to be deprecating toward the Cajun culture it claimed to be saving.

It is commonly seen from ships crossing the Drake Passage, but has a circumpolar distribution. The species was identified as a new species by Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824 from a drawing made in the South Pacific in 1820. It is the only cetacean to have been widely accepted as a species solely on witness accounts. Description Necropsy of an hourglass dolphin. The markings on the side is a certain character for identification of the species. The hourglass dolphin is colored black on top and white on the belly, with white patches on the sides and sometimes variations of dark grey. For this reason, it was colloquially known by whalers as a \\"sea cow\\" (although it does not belong to the taxonomic order Sirenia) or \\"sea skunk\\". Each flank has a white patch at the front, above the beak, eye and flipper, and a second patch at the rear. These two patches are connected by a thin white strip, creating, loosely speaking, an hourglass shape; hence the common name of the dolphin. The scientific name cruciger means \\"cross-carrier\\" and refers to the area of black coloration, which, viewed from above, vaguely resembles a Maltese cross or cross patt√©e. There have been no verified sightings of calves and their coloration remains unknown. In its usual range the dolphin is easily identifiable. The southern right whale dolphin is the only cetacean of comparable size and comparable coloration with overlapping distributions that lives as far south. The absence of a dorsal fin in right whale dolphins, in contrast to the generally tall and curved dorsal fin of hourglass dolphins makes confusion of the two species very unlikely. The dorsal fin in hourglass dolphins is variable and the curvature may be particularly pronounced in older animals. An adult male is about 1.8 meters (5.9 ft) in length and weighs over 90 kilograms (about 200 lbs). and weighs 90‚Äì120 kilograms (200‚Äì260 lb) Juvenile females range from 1.6-1.8 meters (5.2-5.9 ft) in length and weigh from 70-90 kilograms (154-200 lbs). Males are thought to be slightly smaller and lighter than females, although the small number of specimens does not permit a firm conclusion. Like all species of dolphins, they use echolocation to find food. Geographic range and distribution The range is circumpolar from close to the Antarctic pack ice to about 45¬∞S. The northernmost confirmed sightings are 36¬∞S in the South Atlantic Ocean and 33¬∞S near Valpara√≠so, Chile, in the Pacific. Sightings have been made most commonly from the south of New Zealand, around the South Shetland Islands and off Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. Behavior Hourglass dolphins are often seen in smaller groups up to 10-15 individuals, though groups of up to 100 have been observed. They share feeding grounds with other cetaceans such as pilot whales, minke whales and southern right whale dolphins and are regularly seen with fin whales. Hourglass dolphins frequently bow-ride waves from ships and baleen whales. Examinations of the stomach contents of the few specimens indicate they eat mantis shrimp, polychaete worms, and various (unrecorded) species of squid and small fish. Taxonomy The species was first named Delphinus cruciger by Quoy and Gaimard (1824) after their sighting in January 1820. Lesson and Garnot (1827) named another dolphin with two white patches on the sides Delphinus bivittatus. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, scientists have given the hourglass dolphin various synonyms, including Phocoena crucigera (Philippi, 1893), Electra crucigera (Gray, 1871), and Lagenorhynchus clanculus (Gray, 1846; 1849; 1850; 1866). Though it is traditionally placed in the genus Lagenorhynchus, molecular analyses suggest the species is more closely related to the right whale dolphins and dolphins of the genus Cephalorhynchus and it has been suggested that it should be moved to a new genus Sagmatias. The taxonomic relationship with the genus Cephalorhynchus (which includes, among others, Hector's dolphin) is further supported by the similarity of the echolocation signals to the signals used by Cephalorhynchus- species. Population status Sighting surveys were conducted in 1976‚Äì77 and 1987‚Äì88. Abundance was estimated to be 144,300 individuals, based on line transect sightings in January 1977 and January 1988 in northern Antarctic waters. This is the only abundance estimate of hourglass dolphins to date. Conservation status The hourglass dolphin is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU). They are also listed in Appendix II of the 2003 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Although they have not been studied extensively, there are no known major threats to hourglass dolphins, and the species is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

It is still a relatively important fishing harbour. It is situated on the B1 Ardglass to Downpatrick road, about 6 miles (11 kilometres) to the south east of Downpatrick, in the Lecale peninsula on the Irish Sea. It had a population of 1,668 in the 2001 Census, and is located within the Newry, Mourne and Down area. The village is a commuter centre for workers in Downpatrick and Belfast, a seaside resort and a local service centre providing housing and a variety of shops and services largely concentrated in Castle Place, Quay Street, Kildare Street and Bath Street. A Conservation area was designated in Ardglass in 1996, focused on its early 19th century street pattern. The village has eight archaeological sites within the area and another two nearby. There are a number of listed properties located on Castle Place, Kildare Street and The Crescent. St Nicholas's Church, King's Castle, Ardglass Castle, Isabella Tower, the disused railway station, the North Pier and the inner Dock are also listed. History Ardglass grew from a place of little note in the 13th century to a modestly prosperous port in the 15th century. It was an important town and port in the Middle Ages, but no harbour works seem to have been constructed until after 1812. Then William Ogilvie, who had acquired the Ardglass estate, had a harbour built. Further extensions to the pier and a lighthouse were made, but in 1838 a great storm undermined the lighthouse which fell into the sea along with the end of the pier. The harbour master between 1845 and 1858 was Captain Bernard Hughes (1790-1866), M.N., who was also private secretary to the local squireen, Aubrey de Vere Beauclerk, (a grandson of William Ogilvie), and master of the Erasmus Smith school in Ardglass. When the S.S. Great Britain was run aground in Dundrum Bay in 1846 due to a navigational error, Hughes was involved in her salvage. This led him to champion Ardglass as a \\"Harbour of Refuge\\" for vessels off the northeast coast of Ireland in times of distress. He carried on a tireless campaign in the local press and with the Admiralty to achieve his goal, but was ultimately unsuccessful. He invented and patented the keystone method of constructing sea walls in 1849-51 which involved stones being set together without the use of mortar to allow them to expand when being pounded by wave action. Captain Bernard Hughes's sons included John Waring Maxwell Hughes (1816-1906), for whom see passim, and his grandsons; Commander William Thomas Hughes (1880-1978), staff captain of the RMS Mauretania, and Vice-Commodore Johnstone Hughes (1866-1931) of Messrs Elder Dempster, who was born in Ardglass. His great-grandsons included, Major General William Dillon Hughes, (1900-1998), head of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who was born in Ardglass, and Air Marshal Sir Andrew Mc Kee (1903-1985), former head of Transport Command. Work on the pier was completed by 1885 and it remains in use to this day. Ardglass contains more medieval tower-houses than any other town in Ireland, a total of four, reflecting its importance as Ulster's busiest port in the 15th century. It also has probably the most extensive network of warehouses from the period surviving in Ireland. These were important in the substantial grain export trade of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Fortifications survive in the town from the fifteenth century, including Jordan's Castle, the most imposing of a ring of towers built around the harbour to secure the then important Anglo-Norman trading port, King's Castle and Cowd Castle. Nearby are the ruins of the 15th-century Ardtole Church. Francis Joseph Bigger, the Irish nationalist, and sometime Belfast solicitor, purchased Jordan's Castle at Ardglass in the 1890s. He restored the castle, naming it Castle Sean, a model of the Celtic Revival and made it a meeting place for its more prominent people, such as Alice Stopford Green, finally bequeathing it to the state. Account of Ardglass in 1833 The Dublin Penny Journal of 30 March 1833 describes Ardglass as follows:  Economy  Ardglass has been a fishing port for more than two thousand years and developed as such due to its location on the east coast of Lecale and its sitting by a natural inlet. It has one of the few harbours which is accessible at all states of the tide and today has two fishing piers, the North Pier and South Pier, a number of fish processing factories and a marina. While the port is not as busy now as in its heyday, 150 years ago, up to ¬£5 million passes through the fish trade here every year. The port specialises in herrings, prawns, and whitefish.

It lies on the northeast coast of the Ards Peninsula, about east of Belfast and about six miles (10 km) south east of Bangor. It is in the civil parish of Donaghadee and the historic barony of Ards Lower. It had a population of 6,869 people in the 2011 Census. History Donaghadee c.1914 In the 17th century Ulster ports began to rise in prominence. In 1625 William Pitt was appointed as Customer of the ports of Newcastle, Dundrum, Killough, Portaferry, Donaghadee, Bangor and Holywood. In 1637 the Surveyor General of Customs issued a report compiled from accounts of customs due from each port and their \\"subsidiary creeks\\". Of the Ulster ports on the list, Carrickfergus was first, followed by Bangor, Donaghadee and Strangford. The town also featured in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. On the morning of Pike Sunday, 10 June 1798 a force of United Irishmen, mainly from Bangor, Donaghadee, Greyabbey and Ballywalter attempted to occupy the town of Newtownards. They met with musket fire from the market house and were defeated. Donaghadee was used in the 1759‚Äì1826 period by couples going to Portpatrick in Scotland to marry, as there was a daily packet boat. During this period, Portpatrick was known as the \\"Gretna Green for Ireland\\". The lifeboat station at Donaghadee harbour, founded in 1910, is one of the most important on the Irish coast. is a famous lifeboat once based in Donaghadee and now on show and preserved at the harbour for her gallant efforts over 50 years ago. On 31 January 1953 the lifeboat rescued 32 survivors in the Irish Sea from the stricken Larne‚ÄìStranraer car ferry, MV Princess Victoria. Demography On Census day (27 March 2011) there were 6,869 people living in Donaghadee (2,997 households), accounting for 0.38% of the NI total.

For centuries, it has been a haven for ships, and the harbour has been there from at least the 17th century. Sir Hugh Montgomery built a large stone quay to accommodate vessels ferrying between Scotland and Ireland from 1616 onwards. Viscount Montgomery's harbour (1626; improved 1640), superseding what had hitherto been probably only a small jetty, was built and maintained as a result of the Royal Warrant of 1616 which limited travel between the Ards and the Rhins of Galloway to this port, and that at Portpatrick also owned by Montgomery. It was described by Harris in 1744 as 'a curving quay about long and wide built of uncemented stones'. It ran from the shore at the north end of the Parade in a broad arc, bent against the open sea, towards the southern end of the present north pier. Much patched and decrepit, the quay was virtually rebuilt, though along the original line, between 1775 and 1785 by the landlord, Daniel Delacherois, probably with the help of John Smeaton, a civil engineer who had apparently made earlier more elaborate plans for extending the harbour, and had just rebuilt Portpatrick harbour. The old quay remained until after the completion of the new harbour, and then, despite its continued favour by local fishermen, was removed for local wall building about 1833. (It appears in the 1832 drawing but not on the first O.S. map of 1834). The foundation stone of the new harbour was laid by the Marquess of Downshire on 1 August 1821. The initial plans and surveys for this ambitious undertaking were made by John Rennie Senior, the celebrated engineer whose works included Waterloo, Southwark and London Bridges over the Thames. He died within two months of work beginning, and was succeeded by his son, John, later Sir John Rennie, who had as his resident engineer a fellow Scot, the seasoned marine builder, David Logan, who had assisted Robert Stevenson at the Bell Rock Lighthouse (1807‚Äì1810). The new harbour had to have greater depth to accommodate steam packets. Rock blasted from the sea bed, within the harbour area and further south in what became known as the Quarry Hole at Meetinghouse Point was used to form the outer slopes of the two piers; but the inner faces were built of limestone from the Moelfre quarries of Anglesea. This \\"Anglesea marble\\" lends itself to the finest ashlar dressing and the new piers remain a triumph of stone carving. The flights of steps display special skill in the deep diagonal binding of each solid step, providing a typically robust engineer's response to the wear of seaboots and waves alike. The harbour consists of two independent piers running north westwards out to sea; parallel nearer the shore, they converge at the outer ends to form a harbour mouth wide. At low tide the water in the harbour is fifteen feet deep.

It is one of the most prominent features of the town. The Motte, or the Moat as it is known, dates back to 1818. Today it is part of a park, giving views across the town and seawards towards the Copeland Islands. The original mound was of Norman origin, when a motte and bailey stood on the site. It was initially used as a defensive structure, and provided an excellent look-out post.

There are several restaurants and pubs in the town, including Grace Neill's, opened in 1611 as the \\"King's Arms\\", and which claims to be the oldest bar in all of Ireland, a record, however, held by Sean's Bar in Athlone.

These include Whitby, Morecambe, Wharfedale, Cheltenham, Bangor, Coleraine and more recently, at the AIMS New Ross Festival, where it achieved one of the highest marks ever given. It has also competed at the world-famous International Eisteddfod in Wales. The choir celebrated its 75th anniversary during the 2007/08 season. Donaghadee in the media * Donaghadee served as the basis for fictional town Donaghadoo in the children's television series Lifeboat Luke, which was animated by the Donaghadee animation studio STRAANDLOOPER. * Donaghadee was used as a set for some of the film Mickybo and Me. Dozens of local residents were recruited as extras. * Donaghadee also featured in the films Robot Overlords starring Gillian Anderson, Divorcing Jack, Killing Bono and Mo the Mo Mowlam story, starring Julie Walters.

Donaghadee Rugby Football Club The formation of a rugby club in Donaghadee in 1885 came during a period of rapid growth for the game throughout Ireland. A review of sport in the Newsletter in December that year concluded; \\"Football has rapidly worked its way into the very front rank of our outdoor sports. The two codes of football ‚Äì rugby and association ‚Äì can claim a very large and increasing constituency in this country and the first half of the season has afforded ample evidence that, apart from the increasing numbers, our players are making remarkable strides in the science of the game.\\" It was against that background that the new Donaghadee Club, formed by the Rev. Coote made its first match against Bangor on 7 November 1885. The game ended in a draw. From DRFC website: > \\"The game was played in Donaghadee, possibly on the field behind the Church > of Ireland Rectory ‚Äì in other words on the very same place the Donaghadee > club uses to this day.\\" The club's grounds currently go under the name of Donaldson Park Donaghadee Cricket Club Donaghadee Cricket Club is a member of the NCU Senior League. Donaghadee Ladies' Hockey Club Donaghadee Ladies' Hockey Club has been around since pre-war times. They currently have two teams which play in Ulster Hockey leagues: The 1XI play in Senior League 3, while the 2XI are in Junior 8. The club training night is Wednesday from 7.30pm to 9pm at Bangor Grammar School. Club colours are red, green, red.

Donaghadee Golf Club Donaghadee Golf Club was founded in 1899 by Stephen Mccausland and is part links and part open parkland. The course has recently undergone a major course refurbishment with the addition of many new bunkers. The 18th hole is a finishing hole with out of bounds on both left and right, while the sea breeze can provide an extra challenge to visitors. This area of the County Down coastline and Donaghadee in particular provides views over the nearby Copeland Islands. The 16th tee is an excellent vantage point and the hills of south west Scotland can be visible in the distance on a clear day. The club also provides catering facilities in the clubhouse. The golf club has a proud history, winning its second all Ireland trophy in 2007. This was the Irish CLub Youths. They then won their 3rd All Ireland Title in 2012 when Gareth Stranagan's side beat Athenry 4/1 in the Junior Cup final in Kinsale. > \\"Donaghadee Golf Club is worth a visit for the golf enthusiast.

Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925 (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.127. Kissel manufactured trucks of 3/4, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 tons, and maintained a sales office at 2515 Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois in early 1913. In 1915 the company (542 Kissel Ave.) advertised in the National Lumberman the new models that included a 1000 lb. and 6 ton replaced the 5 ton. During World War I the company produced trucks for the US military and for the allies prior to the U.S. entry into the war. In June 1915 Kissel shipped 30 ambulances and 50 heavy service trucks to the Kingdom of Serbia. By 1918 Kissel was producing FWD Model B 3 ton \\"Buddy\\" trucks (not to be confused with the Standard B \\"Liberty\\" 3-ton truck) under license from the Clintonville, Wisconsin based Four Wheel Drive Auto Company for the U.S War Department. Kissel prospered after the war but with stiff competition and the Great Depression, mounting losses, and an attempted hostile take-over by New Era Motors' president Archie Andrews forced Kissel to file for receivership protection in November, 1930. History 4th of July Parade 240px Conrad Kissel (b.1812, d. 1872) emigrated from Prussia to Addison in Washington County, Wisconsin in 1857. His son, Ludwig \\"Louis\\" Kissel, moved to Hartford, Wisconsin, in 1883 and in 1890, in a partnership with his four sons Adolph P., Otto P., William L. and George A., opened Kissel Hardware Store, the Hartford Plow Company that manufactured and distributed farm machinery, Kissel Manufacturing Company, and the Hartford Electric Company. They distributed engines for various manufacturers (Through Kissel Manufacturing Company) and developed their own gasoline engines including outboard boat motors.

She was built speculatively by Armstrong Whitworth and then offered for sale to the British Admiralty. She was launched on 28 June 1899, and purchased by the Navy on 8 May 1900 for ¬£70,000. Her short career came to an end when she broke her back and sank near Cromer on 18 September 1901. The break occurred from her bows, between the two aft boilers. Twelve men ‚Äî including the chief engineer ‚Äî were saved; 44 Navy officers and men, as well as 23 staff from the contractors, mostly employees of the turbine manufacturers, Parsons Marine, were drowned. A court-martial enquiry held in October absolved the surviving officers of all blame, finding that \\"Cobra did not touch the ground or come into any contact with any obstruction, nor was her loss due to any error in navigation, but was due to structural weakness of the ship.\\" This was contested by the manufacturers and other shipbuilders, with examples of equivalent boats being navigated to Australia or Japan without incident. The loss of Cobra came only six weeks after that of the destroyer , the only other turbine-powered ship in the navy. Both ships had been intended as trial vessels to demonstrate the capabilities of the new technology. Neither loss was caused by problems with the turbines, but the losses were still a setback for the general introduction of turbines into warships. The losses came after the loss of in 1890 and created an aversion in the Royal Navy towards snake names, and these names were not reused. History Cobra was constructed by Armstrong Whitworth and company as a private venture and was one of two which it offered for sale to the British Admiralty on 12 December 1899. Ship number 674 was fitted with Parsons Marine turbines similar to those installed in the destroyer . Such engines were expected to be 60% more powerful than reciprocating engines usually fitted to similar ships at that time. There were four shafts from the engines, each driving three propellers. The overall design was based on that for the destroyers and recently built in the same yard. The Director of Naval Construction, Sir William Henry White inspected the vessel and although considering it to be less strong than would have been the case had it been specified by the navy, could find no particular objections to its hull design. It was considered that the Admiralty should purchase it rather than permit its sale to a foreign navy.Barnaby p.133-134 The shipwreck The ship had her first steam trials in June 1900. She was completed including Admiralty alterations and had finished steam trials by September 1901. Lieutenant Bosworth Smith ‚Äî with a crew of two officers and 48 men ‚Äî was appointed to collect the ship from Newcastle and take her to Portsmouth where she would be fitted with guns and ammunition. She left Elswick at 11:00 on 17 September, proceeding down the river Tyne, where the crew adjusted the compass, reaching the mouth of the river by only 19:00 and then taking a course S 25¬∞ E at about . Wind from the NNW and a rough sea caused the ship to roll heavily, so that there was difficulty feeding coal to the boilers and two had to be extinguished, reducing speed to by around 22:00. Stoker John Collins reported that in the early morning of the 18th, the crew could hardly stand in the stokehold. By dawn on the 18th, it was possible to increase speed to . At 07:00, the 'Outer Dowsing' lightvessel was seen about away. Cobra altered course towards the light to confirm its identity and was seen approaching by crewmembers of the lightvessel. Its crew reported that Cobra was seen to be \\"plunging heavily\\", then stopped in a cloud of steam, before breaking in two. The stern section sank, while the bow continued to drift in the wind.Barnaby p. 155 Chief Engineer Percey from Cobra stated that around 07:15, he was in the engine room and felt an impact as though the ship had hit something. He went on deck and discovered that the ship was breaking in two, he being on the aft part. An attempt was made to launch the ship's whaler, but this capsized from overcrowding as 40-50 men tried to get aboard. There were three collapsible boats, but there was insufficient time to assemble them before the ship sank. A dinghy was successfully launched containing Petty Officer Francis Barns and seven others. Barns threw out everything he could from the dinghy and managed to get onboard four more survivors, including Percey. Three of these had to stay in the water holding the side of the boat for three hours until the sea had calmed enough to get them aboard. It was reported that another sailor, reaching the boat after an exhausting swim, saw that \\"if he added his weight all would be lost, so he said \\"It's one for many, good-bye all,\\" and he loosed his grip, sinking to rise no more\\".Agnes Weston: My Life among the Bluejackets, James Nisbett: London, 1909. Page 231 The 12 were picked up by the steamer Harlington at about 18:15 and landed at Middlesbrough. Although men in the water had lifebelts, these were not enough to keep them from drowning in the heavy seas. Lieutenant Smith was last seen standing on the bridge as the front part of the ship sank.Barnaby p.155-156The Times, \\"Wreck of a torpedo boat destroyer\\" (including survivors accounts), 20 September 1901, Issue 36565 p.8. John Smith, master of the steam fishing lighter '15' left Great Yarmouth harbour at 08:00 and heading towards the South Dowsing light. About 16:30, he picked up two dead men from the sea and seeing the wreck of Cobra went towards it. About of the front of the ship was sticking out of the water, bottom uppermost. There was no sign of life around the still visible ship so he went to the lightship for information. He was asked to take news ashore about what had happened, but first returned to Cobras whaler, which was floating upside down and recovered more bodies from the sea. On 20 September, Commander Storey of the naval vessel Hearty attempted to tow the wreck ‚Äî which was still visible ‚Äî into shallower water. He managed only to move it . A Swedish diver ‚Äî Mr. Frank Carlson ‚Äî made several descents to the wreck, which was lying bottom up with the stem raised off the sea bed.The Times, \\"The loss of the Cobra\\", 12 October 1901, Issue 36584 p.12. Court-martial and committee of enquiry A court- martial was held to investigate the sinking under the presidency of Rear- Admiral Pelham Aldrich commencing on 10 October 1901. Armstrong's general manager ‚Äî Mr. Philip Watts ‚Äî was called to give evidence. He was a trained naval architect and later became Director of Naval Construction at the Admiralty. He testified that the ship was slightly longer than Swordfish, thus weaker, but to compensate for this had been increased in depth making it 17% stronger. He did not consider the force of the waves was sufficient to account for the ship breaking up, and anyway the break had not occurred at the point where the hull would be weakest. He conceded that the engines had proved heavier than had been designed for and the ship had been some over her design weight of when she set out. The diver had found a indentation extending along the keel plate starting a foot (30cm) from the jagged break in the ship, although the paintwork was undamaged. Watts claimed this as evidence that the ship had struck the mast of a wrecked ship. No such wreck could be found, but Cobras stern section also could not be located. Carpenter's Mate E. Privett testified that he had felt two slight shocks while standing on the bridge as though the ship had grounded, and that shortly afterwards the stern had risen 20-30¬∞. Captain Shilling from the steamer Oakwell reported hitting floating wood in the nearby area. The court-martial found that the ship had broken up because of structural weaknesses, rather than from striking some object. It also criticised White for having authorised the purchase.Barnaby p. 158-159 An enquiry was set up in November 1901 under Vice-Admiral Rawson because of ongoing concerns that if Cobra had been dangerously weak, other vessels might also be. Committee members included Dr. John Inglis, Professor John Biles, Mr. Archibald Denny and H. E. Deadman. Tests were carried out on the destroyer , which was supported in cradles before surrounding water was drained away, so that the resulting strain on the hull from support at just a few points could be measured. The results confirmed theoretical calculations that the design was sufficiently strong. Sea trials were conducted, where stresses were found to be always lower than those in the dock tests. The final conclusion was that Cobra was weaker than most similar vessels, but stronger than some. There was no reason to believe she should have broken up from wave action unless there had been some undetected major failing in the material from which she was made or in its assembly. There was no evidence of such failings during her construction.Barnaby p. 159 The court martial and enquiry reports were classified as secret for 50 years, preventing outside experts examining the detailed evidence. In more recent times an alternative explanation of the sinking to that produced by the court-martial has been proposed. That Cobra struck timber floating in the water, first causing the denting to the keel plate, but then striking again further back along the ship at a weaker point in the bottom plating, creating a hole. This is consistent with the two shocks reported by some of the survivors. The hole allowed sufficient water to enter the ship that it reached at least the level of the boilers before she broke up. Stoker Collins reported that it was steam from flooding water having reached one of the boilers which alerted the boiler room crew to a problem, and that they evacuated the room before the ship broke in two. The added weight of this quantity of water would have been enough to break the ship in the heavy sea.Barnaby p. 160-162 NotesCitationsBibliography    *The Loss Of The Cobra, The Times, 21 September & 23 September 1901 *The Loss Of The Cobra: Verdict Of The Court-Martial, The Times, 17 October 1901, with subsequent correspondence in October & November.

It is a term introduced by Augustus Le Plongeon, who used the \\"Land of Mu\\" as an alternative name for Atlantis. It was subsequently popularized as an alternative term for the hypothetical land of Lemuria by James Churchward, who asserted that Mu was located in the Pacific Ocean before its destruction. Archaeologists assign assertions about Mu to the category of pseudoarchaeology. The place of Mu in literature has been discussed in detail in Lost Continents (1954) by L. Sprague de Camp. Geologists dismiss the existence of Mu and the lost continent of Atlantis as physically impossible, arguing that a continent can neither sink nor be destroyed in the short period of time asserted in legends and folklore and literature about these places. Page 60. Mu's existence is considered to have no factual basis. Page 228. Page 220. History of the concept=Augustus Le Plongeon The mythical idea of the \\"Land of Mu\\" first appeared in the works of Augustus Le Plongeon (1825‚Äì1908), after his investigations of the Maya ruins in Yucat√°n. He claimed that he had translated the first copies of the Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the K'iche' from the ancient Mayan using Spanish.Card J. Jeb (2018). Spooky Archaeology, Myth and the Science of the Past. University of New Mexico Press: Albuquerque pg. 130 The civilization of Yucat√°n was older than those of Greece and Egypt, and told the story of an even older continent. Le Plongeon got the name \\"Mu\\" from Charles √âtienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, who, in 1864, mistranslated what was then called the Troano Codex (now called \\"Madrid Codex\\") using the de Landa alphabet. Brasseur believed that a word which he read as Mu referred to a land that had been submerged by a catastrophe.John Sladek, The New Apocrypha (New York: Stein and day, 1974) 65‚Äì66. Le Plongeon identified this lost land with Atlantis and, following Ignatius Donnelly in Atlantis: The Antediluvian World (1882), identified it as a continent that had once existed in the Atlantic Ocean: Le Plongeon claimed that the civilization of ancient Egypt was founded by Queen Moo, a refugee from the land's demise. Other refugees supposedly fled to Central America and became the Maya. James Churchward Churchward's map showing how he thought Mu refugees spread out after the cataclysm through South America, along the shores of Atlantis, and into Africa Mu, as an alternative name for a lost Pacific Ocean continent previously identified as the hypothetical Lemuria (the supposed place of origin for lemurs), was later popularised by James Churchward (1851‚Äì1936) in a series of books, beginning with Lost Continent of Mu, the Motherland of Man (1926), re-edited later as The Lost Continent Mu (1931). Re-published by Adventures Unlimited Press (2007) Other popular books in the series are The Children of Mu (1931), and The Sacred Symbols of Mu (1933). Churchward claimed that \\"more than fifty years ago\\", while he was a soldier in India, he befriended a high-ranking temple priest who showed him a set of ancient \\"sunburnt\\" clay tablets, supposedly in a long-lost \\"Naga-Maya language\\" which only two other people in India could read. Churchward convinced the priest to teach him the dead language and decipher the tablets by promising to restore and store the tablets, for Churchward was an expert in preserving ancient artifacts. The tablets were written in either Burma or in the lost continent of Mu itself, according to the high priest.Churchward, James (1926). Lost Continent of Mu, the Motherland of Man. United States: Kessinger Publishing. . Having mastered the language himself, Churchward found out that they originated from \\"the place where [man] first appeared‚ÄîMu\\". The 1931 edition states that \\"all matter of science in this work are based on translations of two sets of ancient tablets\\": the clay tablets he read in India, and a collection of 2,500 stone tablets that had been uncovered by William Niven in Mexico. The tablets begin with the creation of Earth, Mu, and the superior human civilization Naacal by the seven commands of the seven superlative intellects of the seven-headed serpent Narayana. This creation story dismisses the theory of evolution. Churchward gave a vivid description of Mu as the home of an advanced civilization, the Naacal, which flourished between 50,000 and 12,000 years ago, was dominated by a ‚Äúwhite race\\", and was \\"superior in many respects to our own\\". At the time of its demise, about 12,000 years ago, Mu had 64,000,000 inhabitants and seven major cities, and colonies on the other continents. The 64 million inhabitants were separated as ten tribes that followed one government and one religion. Churchward claimed that the landmass of Mu was located in the Pacific Ocean, and stretched east‚Äìwest from the Marianas to Easter Island, and north‚Äìsouth from Hawaii to Mangaia. According to Churchward the continent was supposedly 5,000 miles east to west and over 3,000 miles from north to south. That is bigger than the continent South America. The continent was believed to be flat with massive plains, vast rivers, rolling hills, large bays, and estuaries.Churchward, James (1926). Lost Continent of Mu, the Motherland of Man. United States: Kessinger Publishing. He claimed that according to the creation myth he read in the Indian tablets, Mu had been lifted above sea level by the expansion of underground volcanic gases. Eventually Mu \\"was completely obliterated in almost a single night\\": after a series of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, \\"the broken land fell into that great abyss of fire\\" and was covered by \\"fifty millions of square miles of water.\\" Churchward claims the reasoning for the continent's destruction in one night was because the main mineral on the island was granite and was honeycombed to create huge shallow chambers and cavities filled with highly explosive gases. Once the gases were empty after the explosion they collapsed on themselves causing the island to crumble and sink.Churchward, James (1926). Lost Continent of Mu, the Motherland of Man. United States: Kessinger Publishing. Churchward claimed that Mu was the common origin of the great civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Central America, India, Burma and others, including Easter Island, and was in particular the source of ancient megalithic architecture. As evidence for his claims, he pointed to symbols from throughout the world, in which he saw common themes of birds, the relation of the Earth and the sky, and especially the Sun. Churchward claims that the king of Mu was named Ra and he relates this to the Egyptian god of the sun, Ra, and the Rapa Nui word for Sun, ra‚Äôa. He claimed to have found symbols of the Sun in \\"Egypt, Babylonia, Peru and all ancient lands and countries ‚Äì it was a universal symbol.\\" Other pieces of evidence for his claims, Churchward looked to the Holy Bible and found that through his own translations, Moses was trained by Naacal brotherhood in Egypt. Assyria mis- translated when writing and misplaced the garden of Eden, which according to Churchward would have been located in the Pacific ocean. Churchward makes references to the Ramayana epic, a religious text of Hindu attributed to sage and historian Valmiki. Valmiki mentions the Naacals as ‚Äúcoming to Burma from the land of their birth in the East,‚Äù that is, in the direction of the Pacific Ocean. Churchward attributed all megalithic art in Polynesia to the people of Mu. He claimed that symbols of the sun are found \\"depicted on stones of Polynesian ruins\\", such as the stone hats (pukao) on top of the giant moai statues of Easter Island. Citing W. J. Johnson, Churchward describes the cylindrical hats as \\"spheres\\" that \\"seem to show red in the distance\\", and asserts that they ‚Äúrepresent the Sun as Ra.‚Äù He also incorrectly claimed that some of them are made of \\"red sandstone\\", which does not exist on the island. The platforms on which the statues rest (ahu) are described by Churchward as being \\"platform-like accumulations of cut and dressed stone\\", which were supposedly left in their current positions \\"awaiting shipment to some other part of the continent for the building of temples and palaces\\". He also cites the pillars \\"erected by the MƒÅori of New Zealand\\" as an example of this lost civilization's handiwork. In Churchward's view, the present-day Polynesians are not descendants of the dominant members of the lost civilization of Mu, responsible for these great works, but are instead descendants of survivors of the cataclysm that adopted \\"the first cannibalism and savagery\\" in the world. The lost continent of Mu, according to Jack E. Churchward, is different from the continent of Lemuria that is theorized to be in the Pacific or Indian Ocean. In his novels, Churchward never mentions of the supposed other lost continent of Lemuria. Lemuria is imagined to be slightly bigger than Mu when located in the Pacific, but otherwise most people generally consider them the same mythological continent that once existed in the Pacific Ocean. John Newbrough In the 1882 novel Oahspe: A New Bible, John Newbrough included a map of the Earth in antediluvian times (before the great flood in biblical times) where an unknown continent is located in the Northern Pacific. Newbrough called this continent Pan. People often link both Pan and Mu as the same mythological continent since both are claimed to be located in the Pacific. Newbrough continues to claim that the unknown continent disappeared 24,000 years ago, but will soon rise from the Pacific and will be inhabited by the Kosmon race.Camp De Sprague L. (1970). Lost Continents, The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature pg.70-71. Dover Publications, Inc: New York Max Heindel Max Heindel, a Danish-American occultist, wrote about Mu in The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception (1909), which offers a different image and chronology. According to Heindel, Mu existed when the Earth's crust was still hardening, in a period of high heat and dense atmosphere. Heindel claims humans existed at this time, but humans had the power to shape-shift. He says they had no eyes but rather two sensitive spots that were affected by the light of the Sun. In the dense atmosphere, humans were guided more by internal perception than by external vision. The language of these humans consisted of the sounds of nature.Wauchope Robert (1962). Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method In The Study Of American Indians, pp. 42-43. University of Chicago Press: Chicago and London. Louis Jacolliot Louis Jacolliot was a French attorney, judge, and occultist who specialized in the translation of Sanskrit. He wrote about the land of the Rutas, a lost land that ancient sources claimed was in the Indian Ocean but which he placed in the Pacific Ocean and associated with Atlantis stories in Histoire des Vierges. Les Peuples et les continents disparus (1874). He amplified upon this in Occult Science in India (1875, English translation 1884). He has been identified as a contributor to Rosicrucianism.Camp De Sprague L. (1970). Lost Continents, The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature, p. 70. Dover Publications, Inc: New York Underwater structures claimed to be remnants of Mu, near Yonaguni, Japan Modern claims James Bramwell and William Scott-Elliot claimed that the cataclysmic events on Mu began 800,000 years ago and went on until the last catastrophe, which occurred in precisely 9564 BC. In the 1930s, Atat√ºrk, founder of the Turkish Republic, was interested in Churchward's work and considered Mu as a possible location of the original homeland of the Turks.Kayƒ±p Kƒ±ta Mu, presentation, Ege-Meta Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞zmir, 2000, Masaaki Kimura has suggested that certain underwater features located off the coast of Yonaguni Island, Japan (popularly known as the Yonaguni Monument), are ruins of Mu (or \\"ruins of the lost world of Muin\\" according to CNN). Criticisms=Geological arguments Modern geological knowledge rules out \\"lost continents\\" of any significant size. According to the theory of plate tectonics, which has been extensively confirmed since the 1970s, the Earth's crust consists of lighter \\"sial\\" rocks (continental crust rich in aluminium silicates) that float on heavier \\"sima\\" rocks (oceanic crust richer in magnesium silicates). The sial is generally absent in the ocean floor where the crust is a few kilometers thick, while the continents are huge solid blocks tens of kilometers thick. Since continents float on the sima much like icebergs float on water, a continent cannot simply \\"sink\\" under the ocean. It is true that continental drift and seafloor spreading can change the shape and position of continents and occasionally break a continent into two or more pieces (as happened to Pangaea). However, these are very slow processes that occur in geological time scales (hundreds of millions of years). Over the scale of history (tens of thousands of years), the sima under the continental crust can be considered solid, and the continents are basically anchored on it. It is almost certain that the continents and ocean floors have retained their present position and shape for the whole span of human existence. There is also no conceivable event that could have \\"destroyed\\" a continent, since its huge mass of sial rocks would have to end up somewhere‚Äîand there is no trace of it at the bottom of the oceans. The Pacific Ocean islands are not part of a submerged landmass but rather the tips of isolated volcanoes. Map of Easter Island showing locations of the ahu and moai This is the case, in particular, of Easter Island, which is a recent volcanic peak surrounded by deep ocean (3,000 m deep at 30 km off the island). After visiting the island in the 1930s, Alfred M√©traux observed that the moai platforms are concentrated along the current coast of the island, which implies that the island's shape has changed little since they were built. Moreover, the \\"Triumphal Road\\" that Pierre Loti had reported ran from the island to the submerged lands below, is actually a natural lava flow. Furthermore, while Churchward was correct in his claim that the island has no sandstone or sedimentary rocks, the point is irrelevant because the pukao are all made of native volcanic scoria. Archaeological evidence After the Pleistocene, cultures of the Americas and the Old World developed social complexity independent of each other, and, in fact, agriculture and sedentism emerged in multiple locations around the world after the inception of the Holocene at 11,700 BP. The emergence of Pre- Pottery Neolithic A sites such as G√∂bekli Tepe and Neolithic villages such as Jericho and √áatalh√∂y√ºk in the Levant and Anatolia, respectively, result from local processes of cultural evolution, not colonization by individuals from elsewhere. Easter Island was first settled around AD 300; and the pukao on the moai are regarded as having ceremonial or traditional headdresses. Archaeologist Robert Wauchope noted sarcastically that \\"One exasperated anthropologist wondered whether it would not be more reasonable to suppose that it was less the cataclysms of nature that wiped out these civilizations than a possible head-on clash between the eager colonizers of Mu and those of Atlantis.\\"Wauchope Robert (1962).

He was removed on 29 August 1916 after the failure at the Battle of Verdun, the opening of the Battle of the Somme, the Brusilov Offensive and the entry of Romania into the war on the Allied side undid his strategy to end the war before 1917. He was later given important field commands in Romania and Syria. His reputation as a war leader was attacked in Germany during and after the war, especially by the faction which supported Paul von Hindenburg. Falkenhayn held that Germany could not win the war by a decisive battle but would have to reach a compromise peace; his enemies said he lacked the resolve necessary to win a decisive victory. Falkenhayn's relations with the Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg were troubled and undercut Falkenhayn's plans. Early life Falkenhayn was born in Burg Belchau near Graudenz, West Prussia (now Bia≈Çochowo, Poland) to Fedor von Falkenhayn (1814‚Äì1896) and Franziska von Falkenhayn, n√©e von Rosenberg (1826‚Äì1888). His brother Arthur (1857‚Äì1929) became tutor of Crown Prince Wilhelm while Eugen (1853‚Äì1934) became a Prussian General of Cavalry. His only sister Olga von Falkenhayn was the mother of Fieldmarshall Fedor von Bock. Military career Becoming a cadet at the age of 11, he joined the Army in 1880. He served as an infantry and staff officer and became a career soldier. Between 1896 and 1903, Falkenhayn served in Qing- Dynasty China on leave for several years and saw action during the Boxer Rebellion. He also spent time in Manchuria and Korea. After his service in Asia, the army posted him to Brunswick, Metz and Magdeburg; he became a major- general in 1912. Prussian Minister of War (1913‚Äì1915) In 1913 he became Prussian Minister of War, in which capacity he was involved at the beginning of World War I, when the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo took place. Like most German military leaders, he did not expect a great European war but he soon embraced the idea and joined with others pushing for Kaiser Wilhelm II to declare war. Chief of Staff (1914‚Äì1916) Falkenhayn succeeded Helmuth von Moltke the Younger as Chief of the Oberste Heeresleitung (German General Staff) after the First Battle of the Marne on 14 September 1914. Falkenhayn attempted to outflank the British and French in the Race to the Sea, a series of engagements throughout northern France and Belgium in which each side made reciprocal attempts to turn the other's flank, until they reached the North Sea and had no more room for manoeuvre. The British and French eventually stopped the German advance at the First Battle of Ypres (October‚ÄìNovember 1914). Falkenhayn preferred an offensive strategy on the Western Front, while conducting a limited campaign in the east; he hoped that Russia would accept a separate armistice more easily, if it were not humiliated too much. This brought him into conflict with Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff, who favored massive offensives in the east. Eventually, in the hope that either a massive slaughter would lead Europe's political leaders to consider ending the war or that losses would be less harmful for Germany than for France, Falkenhayn staged a battle of attrition, as claimed in his post-war memoirs, in the Battle of Verdun in early 1916. Although more than a quarter of a million soldiers eventually died and Falkenhayn was sometimes called \\"the Blood-Miller of Verdun\\", neither side's resolve was lessened. Contrary to Falkenhayn's expectations the French were able to limit casualties in the divisions sent to Verdun. General Philippe P√©tain kept the divisions in the line at Verdun until casualties reached 50 per cent of the infantry and then relieved them. The procession of divisions back and forth was analogous to the operation of a \\"noria\\", a type of water- wheel that continuously lifts water and empties it into a trough. After the relative failure at Verdun, coupled with reverses on the Eastern Front (the Brusilov Offensive and the entry of Romania into the war), the beginning of the Anglo-French offensive on the Somme and the intrigues of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, Falkenhayn was replaced as Chief of Staff by Hindenburg on 29 August, 1916. Romania (1916‚Äì1917) Falkenhayn then assumed command of the 9th Army in Transylvania (6 September 1916) and in August launched a joint offensive against Romania with August von Mackensen. Falkenhayn's forces captured the Romanian capital of Bucharest in under four months, with help of troops from all Central Powers against the sizeable but inexperienced and poorly trained and equipped Romanian Army, which had to defend a front, the longest in Europe. Palestine (1917‚Äì1918) Following the success, in mid- July 1917 Falkenhayn went to take military command of the Ottoman Yildirim Army Group (Heeresgruppe F, Army Group F), which was being formed in Mesopotamia and at Aleppo. After long discussions with the Ottoman upper echelon, Falkenhayn was sent on 7 September 1917 as supreme commander of two Ottoman armies in Palestine, with the rank of a Mushir (Field Marshal) of the Ottoman Army. He failed to prevent the British under General Edmund Allenby from conquering Jerusalem in December 1917. However, he is credited with avoiding a destructive defensive battle for the walled ancient city of Jerusalem with its many holy sites, as well as with a crucial role in stopping the forced removal of the Jewish population of Palestine, which Governor Djemal Pasha had planned along the lines of the Armenian Genocide. The evacuation of the entire population of Jerusalem during the harsh winter months had also been planned by Djemal Pasha and was thwarted by German officers including Falkenhayn. Did a German Officer Prevent the Massacre of the Jews of Eretz Yisrael during World War I?, Jewish Ideas Daily version of The Jerusalem Post Magazine article from December 9, 2011 Belarus (1918‚Äì1919) In February 1918, Falkenhayn became commander of the 10th Army in Belarus, where he witnessed the end of the war. In December 1918 he oversaw the withdrawal of the 10th Army to Germany. The formation disbanded in February 1919. Retirement In 1919, Falkenhayn retired from the army and withdrew to his estate, where he wrote his autobiography and several books on war and strategy. His war memoirs were translated into English as The German General staff and Its Critical Decisions, 1914‚Äì1916 (1919). With the benefit of hindsight, he remarked that the German declarations of war on Russia and France in 1914 were \\"justifiable but overly-hasty and unnecessary\\". Falkenhayn died in 1922, at Schloss Lindstedt, near Potsdam. Family life In 1886 Falkenhayn married Ida Selkmann, with whom he had a son Fritz Georg Adalbert von Falkenhayn (1890‚Äì1973) and a daughter Erika Karola Olga von Falkenhayn (1904‚Äì1975) who married Henning von Tresckow (1901‚Äì1944), an officer who helped organise the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler. Assessment Falkenhayn in many ways typified the Prussian generals; a militarist in the literal sense, he had undeniable political and military competence and showed contempt for democracy and the representative Reichstag. He addressed the Reichstag in 1914 as follows: Militarily, Falkenhayn had a mixed record. His offensive at Verdun proved a strategic failure. During the campaign against Romania in 1916 Falkenhayn demonstrated considerable skill in command of the German 9th Army, driving the Romanians from Transylvania, breaking through the Southern Carpathians and forcing the shattered Romanian forces northeast into Moldavia. His defence of Palestine in 1917 was also a failure but his forces, overwhelmingly Ottoman in composition, were outnumbered and outclassed and casualties were fairly equal. Winston Churchill considered him to be the ablest by far of the German generals in World War I. Dupuy also ranked him near the top of the German commanders, just below Hindenburg and Ludendorff. Foley wrote that Germany's enemies were far more able to apply a strategy of attrition, because they had greater amounts of manpower, industry and economic control over the world, resorting to many of the methods used by Falkenhayn in Russia in 1915 and France in 1916. As the cost of fighting the war increased, the war aims of the Entente expanded, to include the overthrow of the political elites of the Central Powers and the ability to dictate peace to a comprehensively defeated enemy, which was achieved by a strategy of attrition. All sources portray Falkenhayn as a loyal, honest and punctilious friend and superior. His positive legacy is his conduct during the war in Palestine in 1917.

It was released in August 2001 for Nintendo's Game Boy Advance, and became the first installment in the Golden Sun series. The game is notable for certain distinctive game elements, such as the use of special Djinn that empower the player and can be used against enemies. Golden Suns story follows a band of magic-attuned teenagers called Adepts. The Adepts are on a mission to protect the world of Weyard from alchemy, a potentially destructive power long ago sealed away. During their quest, the Adepts develop new magic abilities (called Psynergy), assist others, and learn more about why alchemy was sealed away. Golden Sun is followed by a sequel, The Lost Age, which changes perspective to follow the antagonists. The two games put together form one complete story. Golden Sun began as a single planned game for the Nintendo 64 console, but became a mobile title for the Game Boy Advance over the course of around eighteen months of development. Facing hardware constraints, the developers decided to split the game into two. The game was highly praised by critics; IGN's Craig Harris said that Golden Sun could \\"arguably be one of the best 2D-based Japanese RPGs created for any system.\\" The game was also commercially successful and sold more than one million copies in Japan and the United States, spawning a series that includes three games and appearances in other media. Golden Sun was re-released for the Virtual Console via the Wii U eShop in April 2014. Gameplay Golden Suns form of magic, Psynergy, can be used in and out of combat. Here, an ice spell is used to create a navigable path of frozen ice pillars from puddles of water. Golden Sun is a contemporary presentation of the traditional role-playing video game formula, in which the player controls a cast of four characters as they journey through a fantasy- themed world, interact with other characters, battle monsters, acquire increasingly powerful abilities and equipment, and take part in an ongoing narrative. Although many of the player's actions are compulsory, Golden Sun often allows the player to visit previous locations and complete certain objectives out of order. Much of the time spent outside of battle takes place in dungeons, caves, and other locales, which often feature puzzles integrated into their layout. These puzzles require the player to perform a variety of actions, such as creating makeshift bridges by pushing logs into rivers or shifting the track of a mine cart to gain access to new areas. Many of these puzzles require use of the game's form of magic spells, called \\"Psynergy\\"; this is in contrast to many RPGs, which often restrict magic to within battles and post-combat healing. Psynergy, however, is used for both purposes; for example, the \\"Whirlwind\\" spell that damages enemies in battle is also used out of battle to remove overgrown foliage blocking the player's path. Psynergy comes in four elements: Venus (manipulation of rocks and plants), Mars (revolving around fire and heat), Jupiter (based on wind and electricity), and Mercury (concerning water and ice). Players can return to previous locations in the game to finish puzzles which they could not solve earlier because of the lack of a specific Psynergy spell. Battle and Djinn Battles in Golden Sun have many special effects. Here, a weapon-specific attack is unleashed by the sword Gaia Blade. Golden Sun contains both random monster encounters, featuring randomly selected enemies, and compulsory boss battles that advance the story. When a battle begins, a separate screen is brought up in which the player's party faces off against the enemy. During a battle, the characters and the background rotate to offer a pseudo-3D effect. In each battle, players must defeat the enemies while keeping their own party alive through items and Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense. The player receives a \\"Game Over\\" if each character's hit points are reduced to zero; if this happens, the player will incur a monetary penalty and the party will be returned to the sanctum in the last visited town. After winning a battle, players receive experience points, coins, and occasionally items. Golden Sun also features an optional battling mode accessible from the menu screen. In this mode, players can enter a team from their saved game files into an arena environment where they battle increasingly difficult CPU- controlled enemies. Additionally, players can select three of their four characters to fight another player's three-character team. The player does not receive any reward or punishment for participating in these battles. One of the most distinctive features of Golden Sun is the collection and manipulation of creatures called Djinn. The Djinn are scattered in hiding throughout the game; once found, they can be allocated to each character, though some may require the player to first defeat them in battle. They form the basis of the game's statistic enhancement, as well as the system that dictates the character's Psynergy capabilities. Attaching different Djinn to different characters modifies that character's character class, subsequently modifying hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as determining what Psynergy the character is able to perform. Djinn can either be \\"Set\\" to a player or put on \\"Standby\\". When a Djinni is Set, it gives bonuses to the stats of the character it is on and may change the character's class or usable Psynergy. Set Djinn also have abilities that can be used in battle to attack, heal, or otherwise affect the battle, however using these abilities causes the Djinn to move from being Set to being in Standby mode. There are seven Djinn of each element, and these Djinn can be mixed and matched to the four characters, allowing a large array of possible class setups and a variety of combat options. In combat, a Djinni has several uses. Each Set Djinni has a special ability which can be invoked during combat by the character it is attached to, which can include enhanced elemental attacks, buffing/debuffing spells, healing/restoration spells, and other effects. After a successful invoke, the Djinni shifts to \\"Standby\\" mode until it is \\"Set\\" on the character again. While in standby, the Djinn do not contribute to statistics or change character classes, but can be used for summon spells, which are attacks where the player summons a powerful elemental monster to inflict damage on every enemy and increases the respective characters affinity for that element for a duration. This is the game's most powerful method of attack, but the required switch to Standby mode is a risky trade-off: Djinn used for summoning must rest for several turns before reverting to the Set position, during which time they cannot bolster statistics or classes. There are sixteen Summon Sequences in Golden Sun--four for each element--and each summon sequence requires between one and four Djinn of the same element on Standby. Synopsis=Setting and characters Golden Sun takes place in the fantasy world of \\"Weyard\\"‚Äîa massive, earth-like environment with several major continents and oceans. The plot progression of Golden Sun spans the two largest continents in the world's central region: Angara to the north and Gondowan to the south. Weyard is governed by the mythological concept of the classical elements; matter consists of any combination of the four base elements: Venus, Mars, Mercury and Jupiter, or earth, fire, water, and wind, respectively. These four building blocks of reality can be manipulated by the omnipotent force of Alchemy, which reigned supreme in the world's ancient past. Alchemy was sealed away in the past, but certain persons have the ability to manipulate one of the elements through a form of magic called Psynergy. These wielders of Psynergy are called Adepts. The player controls four characters in Golden Sun. Isaac, the game's silent protagonist, is a seventeen-year-old Venus Adept from the village of Vale. Garet, a seventeen-year-old Mars Adept also from Vale, is Isaac's closest companion. Ivan is a fifteen-year-old Jupiter Adept who has lived with a famous merchant in the town of Kalay his entire life. Mia, a sixteen-year-old Mercury Adept from the wintry town of Imil, is a gentle healer from a heritage of Mercury Adept clansmen. A fifth character seen and playable in the game's exposition sequence is the 17-year-old Mars Adept Jenna, another childhood friend to Isaac. The primary antagonists of the game are Saturos and Menardi, a pair of immensely powerful and talented Mars Adepts of a foreign race hailing from Prox, a town in Weyard's frigid north. Their goal is to restore Alchemy to the world, and they are assisted by the powerful and mysterious Mercury Adept Alex, who is of the same heritage as Mia; and Jenna's older brother, the 18-year-old Venus Adept Felix, who is indebted to Saturos for saving Felix from death. Plot The prevalent force of Alchemy in Weyard's ancient past enabled the development of great civilizations. However, this thriving period eventually gave way to a worldwide conflict that subsided only with the sealing away of Alchemy. The keys to unlocking Alchemy, the four Elemental Stars which hold the pure power of the four elements, are hidden within the mountain shrine, Mt. Aleph, which in turn is guarded by the town of Vale at the mountain's base. In the game's prologue, Saturos and Menardi, with help from a raiding party, storm Mt. Aleph with the intention to seize the Elemental Stars for themselves. They fail to solve the riddles guarding the stars and are driven away by the mountain's trap, a magically generated thunderstorm and rock slide. In the ensuing chaos, Felix, Isaac's father, and Jenna's parents are all presumed dead. Three years later, Isaac, Garet, and Jenna join their teacher, Kraden, in his research of Mt. Aleph. Their research coincides with a second raid of the sanctum by Saturos and Menardi, now assisted by Alex and a surviving Felix, who coerce Isaac into giving them three of the four stars. The volcano erupts before they can retrieve the final star, but before escaping they capture Jenna and Kraden as eventual bargaining chips. The guardian of Mt. Aleph, the Wise One, appears before Isaac and Garet and instructs them to prevent Saturos' group from casting the Elemental Stars into their respective Elemental Lighthouses across Weyard; if this happens, Alchemy will be restored and the period of instability will begin anew. Isaac and Garet pursue Saturos' group to the Mercury Lighthouse, joined by Ivan and Mia. Despite their best efforts, they fail to prevent Saturos from activating Mercury Lighthouse with the Mercury Star. Saturos' group leaves for the next Lighthouse with Isaac's party remaining in pursuit. In the ensuing chase, Isaac learns that Saturos has taken another Adept hostage: the female Jupiter Adept, Sheba. Saturos and Menardi activate the Venus Lighthouse with the Venus Star, and are confronted by Isaac's party immediately thereafter. Attempting to annihilate their opponents, Saturos and Menardi magically merge to form a massive two-headed dragon, but Isaac's party slay Saturos and Menardi. Directly following this, Sheba falls from the lighthouse and Felix proceeds to jump out after her. The remnants of Saturos' group, headed by Felix and Alex, continue their quest to light the remaining two Lighthouses, with Jenna, Sheba, and Kraden still with them. The game ends as Isaac's party boards a ship and sail out into Weyard's open seas to continue their mission. Development Camelot Software Planning spent between twelve and eighteen months developing Golden Sun, which is considered a long time for a handheld video game; the finished product was described as a testament to the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game. In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan. North American reviewers received the game a few weeks before the release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld. Camelot originally planned to create a single title instead of a series, and in the extremely early stages of their project they had created a game design document for the one Golden Sun game to be on the Nintendo 64 console. When it became apparent the N64 was to be superseded by the Nintendo GameCube, Camelot shifted their focus to making a game on the handheld Game Boy Advance. Golden Sun was still intended to be a single game, but due to the hardware limitations of putting the game on a single Game Boy Advance cartridge and the developers' own desire for what they wanted to do with the game, it was expanded to become two successive games, Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age. Scenario writer Hiroyuki Takahashi and director Shugo Takahashi had previously designed Shining Force III, where the story involved playing through the perspectives of both the \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" characters. Thinking that it was an effective way of conveying the full story of a fictional game world, they incorporated elements of this storytelling methodology into the two-game setup of the Golden Sun series, having the player control the \\"good guys\\" in Golden Sun and some of the antagonists in The Lost Age. Reception Golden Sun sold 740,000 copies in the United States and 338,000 in Japan. It received critical acclaim; the title is ranked 91% and 90% on the review score aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively. Many reviewers praised the game's graphics, sound, and varied yet refined RPG gameplay, with particular emphasis on the Battle Mode and Djinn system. Certain critics felt that, despite the technical limitations of its 32-bit cartridge, the game's graphical quality was still extremely high; GameSpot wrote that \\"Golden Sun is a throwback to some of the SNES's best.\\" Complaints generally focused on a perceived overuse of text dialogue in the game's cutscenes--particularly during the prologue section. Some faulted the game for relying on the typical random battle encounter mechanics present in many other role-playing games. G4 TV stated, \\"It's the best original (nonport) GBA RPG to date\\", while GamePro called it a \\"huge, fantastic, creative, and wickedly fun RPG that doesn't seem to care that it's 'just' on a GBA\\". Game Informer called Golden Sun \\"a visual treat\\", and said that its graphics \\"would have amazed Super Nintendo owners back in the day\\". Noting the game's similarity to previous Japanese role-playing games, the reviewers believed that it was \\"easily the best original RPG on the GBA\\", and the \\"new ruler in the GBA RPG realm\\". Advance compared the game to the Pok√©mon series, and considered its graphics \\"luscious\\" and sound \\"incredible [and] cinematic\\". Despite describing its plot as \\"Cliche City\\", the magazine hailed the game as \\"the best handheld role-player ever\\". In 2001, Golden Sun won the Nintendo Power Award for best Game Boy Advance game of the year. Golden Sun was ranked 94 on IGN's Readers Choice Top 100 games ever. In 2007, it was named 24th best Game Boy Advance game in IGN's feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance's long lifespan; the website also named it Game of the Month for April 2003 because it had \\"amazing graphics and sound presentation, as well as a quest that lasts for more than thirty hours.\\" It was rated the 31st best game made on a Nintendo system in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list.

During the First World War the army was active on the Western Front throughout most of the war and later active in Italy. During the Second World War the army was the main British contribution to the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 and advance across Europe. First World War The Second Army was part of the British Army formed on 26 December 1914, when the British Expeditionary Force was split in two due to becoming too big to control its subordinate formations.The British Armies of 1914-1918 The army controlled both III Corps and IV Corps. Second Army spent most of the war positioned around the Ypres salient, but was redeployed to Italy as part of the Italian Expeditionary Force between November 1917 and March 1918. In 1919 it was reconstituted as the British Army of the Rhine.Edmonds (1987) Commanders * 1914‚Äì1915 General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien * 1915‚Äì1917 General Sir Herbert Plumer * 1917‚Äì1918 General Sir Henry Rawlinson * 1918 General Sir Herbert Plumer Second World War=France, 1944 The formation was commanded by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey and served under the 21st Army Group. Two of its formations, I Corps (also containing Canadian units) and XXX Corps took part in the D-Day landings of Operation Overlord, with its remaining units coming ashore during the remainder of the Normandy Campaign. The third corps to land, VIII Corps, entered the line during late June to add its weight to the assault; in particular for the launching of Operation Epsom. The main British objective during the early stages of the campaign was to capture the French city of Caen, the so-called Battle for Caen. However, due to various factors the city was not captured until mid-July during Operation Atlantic, conducted by Canadian troops under the command of Second Army. By the end of July, American forces had broken out of Normandy. As they swept east, the German Seventh Army was pinned by the Second Army and trapped in pockets around Falaise. The German formation was subsequently annihilated during the battle of the Falaise pocket. The Second Army then commenced a dash across France in parallel with the Americans on its right, and the Canadians on its left. During the interim, I Corps was transferred from Second Army's control, and assigned to the First Canadian Army. Due to the heavy casualties sustained by the army during the Normandy campaign, the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division was disbanded in August 1944 to make up for the infantry deficit. Belgium and the Netherlands Second Army entered Belgium quickly, and cleared much of the country. Its captures included the capital Brussels and the port city of Antwerp. Second Army's highest profile operation in 1944, apart from Operation Overlord, was providing the main force for Operation Market Garden. During the operation, American (82nd and 101st), British (1st) and Polish (1st Polish Parachute Brigade) airborne troops, outside the control of Second Army, were landed to capture vital bridges over several rivers in the east of the Netherlands, in order to allow Second Army's XXX Corps to cross the Rhine and advance into Germany, relieving the parachute troops en route. However, the single road XXX Corps had to traverse caused enormous logistical difficulties and, combined with German counterattacks, the operation failed resulting in the loss of much of the 1st Airborne Division during the Battle of Arnhem. Second Army spent the rest of 1944 exploiting the salient in the German line that it had created during Operation Market Garden, to advance on the Rhine and Meuse rivers in the Netherlands. The final part of this advance took place in mid-January 1945, with the clearing of the Roermond Triangle (codename Operation Blackcock) by XII and VIII Corps. This enabled the completion of the advance on the River Roer. During February, 1945, Second Army entered a holding phase. Whilst it pinned down the German forces facing it, the Canadian First Army and US Ninth Army made a pincer movement from north and south (Operations Veritable and Grenade) which pierced the Siegfried Line in that area and cleared the remaining German forces west of the Rhine in conjunction with further American offensives in the south of the Rhineland. Germany, 1945 Second Army crossed the Rhine on 23 March in an attack codenamed Operation Plunder. It then headed across the North German Plain towards Osnabr√ºck, with the First Canadian Army on its left wheeling to clear the north of the Netherlands and the area of Lower Saxony west of Oldenburg. The US Ninth Army on its right turned south-east towards Lippstadt to trap the German Army Group B, under General Walther Model, in an enormous pocket in the Ruhr. With Army Group B trapped, the last major German formation in the west had been neutralized. Second Army reached the Weser on 4 April, the Elbe on 19 April, the shore of the Baltic Sea at L√ºbeck on 2 May. On 3 May, Hamburg capitulated. By 7 May the Soviet Army had met up with the British forces. Shortly thereafter, the Second World War in Europe came to an end with the surrender of the government of Karl D√∂nitz, who had succeeded Adolf Hitler after his suicide.

It is contrasted with Fordism, the system formulated in Henry Ford's automotive factories, in which workers work on a production line, performing specialized tasks repetitively, and organized through Taylorist scientific management. Definitions of the nature and scope of post-Fordism vary considerably and are a matter of debate among scholars. Changes in the nature of the workforce include the growth of labor processes and workflows relying on information and communication technologies and digital labor.  Overview  Post-Fordism is characterized by the following attributes:Hall, S. (October 1988) \\"Brave new world.\\" Marxism Today, p. 24. *Small-batch production *Economies of scope *Specialized products and jobs *New information technologies *Emphasis on types of consumers in contrast to previous emphasis on social class *The rise of the service and the white-collar worker *The feminisation of the work force  Theories  Post-Fordism has been applied to multiple social processes. As the theory continues to evolve, it is commonly divided into three schools of thought: the Regulation School, Flexible Specialization, and Neo-Schumpeterianism. Regulation School The Regulation approach (also called the neo-Marxist or French Regulation School), was designed to address the paradox of how capitalism has both a tendency towards crisis, change and instability as well as an ability to stabilize institutions, rules and norms. The theory is based on two key concepts. \\"Regimes of Accumulation\\" refer to systems of production and consumption, such as Fordism and post-Fordism. \\"Modes of Regulation\\" refer to the written and unwritten laws of society which control the Regime of Accumulation and determine its form. According to Regulation theory, every Regime of Accumulation will reach a crisis point at which the Mode of Regulation will no longer support it, and society will be forced to find new rules and norms, forming a new Mode of Regulation. This will begin a new Regime of Accumulation, which will eventually reach a crisis, and so forth. Proponents of Regulation theory include Michel Aglietta, Robert Boyer, Bob Jessop, and Alain Lipietz.Nilges 2008: Flexible specialization Proponents of the flexible Specialization approach (also known as the neo-Smithian approach) to post-Fordism believe that fundamental changes in the international economy, especially in the early 1970s, forced firms to switch from mass production to a new tactic known as Flexible Specialization. Factors such as the oil shocks of 1973, increased competition from foreign markets (especially Southeast Asia) due to globalization, the end of the post-World War II boom, and increasing privatization made the old system of mass-producing identical, cheap goods through division of labor uncompetitive.reference needed Instead of producing generic goods, firms now found it more profitable to produce diverse product lines targeted at different groups of consumers, appealing to their sense of taste and fashion. Instead of investing huge amounts of money on the mass production of a single product, firms now needed to build intelligent systems of labor and machines that were flexible and could quickly respond to the whims of the market. The technology originally associated with flexible production was the numerical control technology, which was developed in the United States in the 1950s; however, the CNC, developed in Japan, later replaced it. The development of the computer was very important to the technology of flexible specialization. Not only could the computer change characteristics of the goods being produced, but it could also analyze data to order supplies and produce goods in accordance with current demand. These types of technology made adjustments simple and inexpensive, making smaller specialized production runs economically feasible. Flexibility and skill in the labor was also important. The workforce was now divided into a skill- flexible core and a time-flexible periphery. Flexibility and variety in the skills and knowledge of the core workers and the machines used for production allowed for the specialized production of goods. Modern just in time manufacturing is one example of a flexible approach to production. Likewise, the production structure began to change on the sector level. Instead of a single firm manning the assembly line from raw materials to finished product, the production process became fragmented as individual firms specialized on their areas of expertise. As evidence for this theory of specialization, proponents claim that Marshallian \\"industrial districts,\\" or clusters of integrated firms, have developed in places like Silicon Valley, Jutland, Sm√•land, and several parts of Italy. Neo-Schumpeterianism The Neo- Schumpeterian approach to post-Fordism is based upon the theory of Kondratiev waves (also known as long waves). The theory holds that a \\"techno-economic paradigm\\" (Perez) characterizes each long wave. Fordism was the techno- economic paradigm of the fourth Kondratiev wave, and post-Fordism is thus the techno-economic paradigm of the fifth, which is dominated by information and communication technology. Notable Neo-Schumpeterian thinkers comprise Carlota Perez and Christopher Freeman, as well as Michael Storper and Richard Walker. Post-Fordist theory in Italy In Italy, post-Fordism has been theorised by the long wave of workerism or autonomia. Major thinkers of this tendency include the Swiss-Italian economist , Antonio Negri, Paolo Virno, Carlo Vercellone, Maurizio Lazzarato. Marazzi's Capital and Language takes as its starting point the fact that the extreme volatility of financial markets is generally attributed to the discrepancy between the \\"real economy\\" (that of material goods produced and sold) and the more speculative monetary-financial economy. But this distinction has long ceased to apply in the post-Fordist New Economy, in which both spheres are structurally affected by language and communication. In Capital and Language Marazzi argues that the changes in financial markets and the transformation of labor into immaterial labor (that is, its reliance on abstract knowledge, general intellect, and social cooperation) are two sides of a new development paradigm: financialization through and thanks to the rise of the new economy. In terms of the development of the 'technical and political class-composition', in the post-Fordist era the crisis explains at the same time 'high points of the capitalist development' and how new technological tools develop and work altogether (money form, linguistic conventions, capital and language). [Zanini, A. 2010, 'On the Philosophical Foundations of Italian Workerism: A Conceptual Approach', Historical Materialism, 18, 4: 39-63.] Changes from Fordism to post-Fordism Post-Fordism brought on new ways of looking at consumption and production. The saturation of key markets brought on a turn against mass consumption and a pursuit of higher living standards.Milani 2000: 33-35 This shift brought a change in how the market was viewed from a production standpoint. Rather than being viewed as a mass market to be served by mass production, the consumers began to be viewed as different groups pursuing different goals who could be better served with small batches of specialized goods.Kumar 1995: 43 Mass markets became less important while markets for luxury, custom, or positional good became more significant.Milani 2000: 35 Production became less homogeneous and standardized and more diverse and differentiated as organizations and economies of scale were replaced with organizations and economies of scope.Kumar 1995: 51 The changes in production with the shift from Fordism to post-Fordism were accompanied by changes in the economy, politics, and prominent ideologies. In the economic realm, post- Fordism brought the decline of regulation and production by the nation-state and the rise of global markets and corporations. Mass marketing was replaced by flexible specialization, and organizations began to emphasize communication more than command. The workforce changed with an increase in internal marketing, franchising, and subcontracting and a rise in part-time, temp, self-employed, and home workers. Politically, class-based political parties declined and social movements based on region, gender, or race increased. Mass unions began to vanish and were instead replaced by localized plant-based bargaining. Cultural and ideological changes included the rise in individualist modes of thought and behavior and a culture of entrepreneurialism. Following the shift in production and acknowledging the need for more knowledge-based workers, education became less standardized and more specialized. Prominent ideologies that arose included fragmentation and pluralism in values, post-modern eclecticism, and populist approaches to culture.Kumar 1995: 52 Examples=Italy One of the primary examples of specialized post-Fordist production took place in a region known as the Third Italy. The First Italy included the areas of large-scale mass production, such as Turin, Milan, and Genoa, and the Second Italy described the undeveloped South. The Third Italy, however, was where clusters of small firms and workshops developed in the 1970s and 1980s in the central and northeast regions of the country. Regions of the Third Italy included Tuscany, Umbria, Marche, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli, and Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol. Each region specialized in a range of loosely related products and each workshop usually had five to fifty workers and often less than ten. The range of products in each region reflected the post-Fordist shift to economies of scope. Additionally, these workshops were known for producing high quality products and employing highly skilled, well-paid workers. The workshops were very design-oriented and multidisciplinary, involving collaboration between entrepreneurs, designers, engineers and workers.Kumar 1995: 37-39 Japan There were several post-World War II changes in production in Japan that caused post-Fordist conditions to develop. First, there were changes to company structure, including the replacement of independent trade unions with pro-management, company-based unions; the development of a core of permanent male multi-skilled workers; and the development of a periphery of untrained temporary and part-time employees, who were mostly female. Second, after World War II, Japan was somewhat isolated because of import barriers and foreign investment restrictions, and as a result, Japan began to experiment with production techniques. Third, as imported technologies became more available, Japan began to replicate, absorb, and improve them, with many improvements deriving from modifications for local conditions. Fourth, Japan began to concentrate on the need for small-batch production and quick changeover of product lines to serve the demand for a wide range of products in a relatively small market. Because of informal price-fixing, competition was based not on price but rather on product differentiation. As a result, production became less standardized and more specialized, particularly across different companies. Fifth, Japan began to build long-term supply and subcontracting networks, which contrasted with the vertically integrated, Fordist American corporations. Sixth, because small and medium-size manufacturers produced a wide range of products, there was a need for affordable multipurpose equipment as opposed to the specialized, costly production machinery in Fordist industries in the United States. Technology for flexible production was significant in Japan and particularly necessary for smaller producers. The smaller producers also found it necessary to reduce costs. As a result, Japan became one of the main users of robots and CNC.Bernard 2000: 154-156 Over time, these six changes in production in Japan were institutionalized. Criticisms The main criticism of post-Fordism asserts that post-Fordism mistakes the nature of the Fordist revolution and that Fordism was not in crisis, but was simply evolving and will continue to evolve.Kumar 1995: 60 Other critics believe that post-Fordism does exist, but coexists with Fordism. The automobile industry has combined Fordist and post-Fordist strategies,Kiely 1998: 109 using both mass production and flexible specialization. Ford introduced flexibility into mass production, so that Fordism could continue to evolve. Those who advocate post-Fordism, however, note that criticism that focuses primarily on flexible specialization ignores post-Fordist changes in other areas of life and that flexible specialization cannot be looked at alone when examining post-Fordism. Another criticism is that post-Fordism relies too heavily on the examples of the Third Italy and Japan. Some believe that Japan is neither Fordist nor post-Fordist and that vertical disintegration and mass production go hand in hand.Kumar 1995: 58-65 Others argue that the new, smaller firms in Italy didn‚Äôt develop autonomously, but are a product of the vertical disintegration of the large Fordist firms who contracted lower value- added work to smaller enterprises.Kiely 1998: 101 Other criticisms argue that flexible specialization is not happening on any great scale, and smaller firms have always existed alongside mass production. Another main criticism is that we are too much in the midst to judge whether or not there really is a new system of production.Kumar 1995: 168 The term \\"post-Fordism\\" is gradually giving way in the literature to a series of alternative terms such as the knowledge economy, cognitive capitalism, the cognitive-cultural economy and so on. This change of vocabulary is also associated with a number of important conceptual shifts (see sections above).

P. herbstii is small, growing to about 4 cm, with black-tipped claws of unequal size. P. herbstii has a strong exoskeleton, with very thick and strong claws. The shell is a dull gray and brown color. P. herbstii is found along the Atlantic coast of North America, from Boston, Massachusetts to Santa Catarina, Brazil and on Bermuda. It is the most common xanthid crab on the east coast of the United States. It is found on muddy bottoms, where it takes refuge under stones and shells or among sponges and weeds, but it is rarely seen in the open. It feeds mainly on young clams, oysters, and periwinkles; it cracks open their shells with its strong claws. Mud crabs are especially fond of hermit crabs, which are grasped by the legs and pulled out of their protective shells. Like most mud crabs, it is a scavenger. Young P. herbstii are an important food source to other marine animals. It mainly eats oysters.

These small animals burrow in the sand in the swash zone and use their antennae for filter feeding.Sand Fleas (Mole Crabs or Sand Crabs) Prime surf fishing baithttp://www.baymoon.com/~ilga/crabs/ All About Mole Crabs Description Emerita has a barrel-shaped body. It has a tough exoskeleton and can hold its appendages close to the body, allowing it to roll in the tidal currents and waves. It has feathery antennae, which are used to filter plankton and detritus from the swash. Males are typically smaller than females, and in some species, such as Emerita rathbunae, the minute males live attached to the legs of the female. Females are around in carapace length, depending on the species, while males vary from a similar size to females in E. austroafricana, down to carapace length in E. rathbunae and E. talpoida. Distribution The genus as a whole has a broad distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. Most individual species, however, are restricted to smaller areas, and their ranges rarely overlap. The genus is common on both coasts of the United States and along the Atlantic coast of Africa; the related genus Hippa is found across the Indo-Pacific, including Australia. Species Ten species are recognised : * Emerita analoga (Stimpson, 1857) ‚Äì western North America and western South America * Emerita austroafricana Schmitt, 1937 ‚Äì southeastern Africa and Madagascar * Emerita benedicti Schmitt, 1935 ‚Äì Gulf of Mexico * Emerita brasiliensis Schmitt, 1935 ‚Äì southeastern Brazil and northeastern Brazil * Emerita emeritus (Linnaeus, 1767) ‚Äì South Asia and Southeast Asia * Emerita holthuisi Sankolli, 1965 ‚Äì western India, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea * Emerita karachiensis Niazi & Haque, 1974 ‚Äì Pakistan * Emerita portoricensis Schmitt, 1935 ‚Äì Caribbean Sea * Emerita rathbunae Schmitt, 1935 ‚Äì western Central America * Emerita talpoida (Say, 1817) ‚Äì eastern North America * Emerita asiatica (H. Milne Edwards, 1837) ‚Äì southern India The Old World species had been widely thought to form a monophyletic group, as did the New World species. The use of molecular phylogenetics has shown, however, that E. analoga, a species living along the Pacific coast of North America, is more closely related to African species than it is to other New World species. Taxonomy The genus Emerita was erected by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in his 1777 work Introductio ad Historiam Naturalem. The type species is Cancer emeritus (now E. emeritus), because at one time, it was the only species in the genus. Other genera with the same name have been rejected for nomenclatural purposes; these were published by Laurens Theodorus Gronovius (1764) and Friedrich Christian Meuschen (1778 and 1781). Ecology and behaviour E. analoga digging in the sand Emerita is adept at burrowing, and is capable of burying itself completely in 1.5 seconds. Unlike mud shrimp, Emerita burrows tail-first into the sand, using the pereiopods to scrape the sand from underneath its body. During this action, the carapace is pressed into the sand as anchorage for the digging limbs. The digging requires the sand to be fluidised by wave action, and Emerita must bury itself in the correct orientation before the wave has passed to be safe from predators. (Also see Fluidization.) As the tide changes, Emerita changes its position on the beach; most individuals stay in the zone of breaking waves. This may be detected by the physical characteristics of the sand. As the tide falls, the sand is allowed to settle; when Emerita detects this, it uses the temporary liquefaction from a breaking wave to emerge from its burrow, and is carried down the beach by the wave action. Longshore drift may also drag Emerita laterally along a beach. The main predators of Emerita are fish; in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the barred surfperch (Amphistichus argenteus) is particularly important. Seabirds also eat Emerita, but do not appear to target the aggregations of mole crabs. Carcasses of Emerita provide an important food source for the closely related scavenger Blepharipoda. Relationship to humans Due to the Emerita being the predominant diet of the barred surfperch, surf fisherman use sand crabs as bait. Soft-shelled Emerita are kept also as bait by commercial fisheries. In some cultures, sand crabs are eaten as a popular snack, such as in Thailand and parts of India. They are often prepared via shallow frying in a pan or deep frying in batter. The taste is often described as falling somewhere between that of shrimp and crab. In some locations, such as on the Pacific coast of the United States, digging up Emerita is a recreational activity, like digging holes or surfing. Life cycle Eggs on the underside of a female E. analoga Emerita has a short lifespan, perhaps no more than two to three years, and can reproduce in its first year of life. The eggs are bright orange, and hatch into larvae, which may live as plankton for more than four months and can be carried long distances by ocean currents. The number of zoeal stages varies between species from six to eleven.

They sang traditional folk songs from around the world, as well as blues, gospel music, children's songs, labor songs, and American ballads, and sold millions of records at the height of their popularity. Their style inspired the commercial \\"folk boom\\" that followed them in the 1950s and 1960s, including such performers as The Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul, and Mary, The Rooftop Singers, The Seekers, and Bob Dylan. History=Formation In 1940, Lee Hays and Pete Seeger co-founded the Almanac Singers, which promoted peace and isolationism during World War II, working with the American Peace Mobilization (APM). It featured many songs opposing entry into the war by the U.S. In June 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the APM changed its name to the American People's Mobilization and altered its focus to supporting U.S. entry into the war. The Almanacs supported the change and produced many pro-war songs urging the U.S. to fight on the side of the Allies. The Almanac Singers disbanded after the U.S. entered the war. The Weavers were formed in November 1948 by Ronnie Gilbert, Lee Hays, Fred Hellerman, and Pete Seeger. At Hellerman's suggestion,Grimes, William, \\"Fred Hellerman, Last of the Weavers Folk Group, Dies at 89\\", The New York Times, September 2, 2016. Retrieved 2016-09-03. The group took its name from a play by Gerhart Hauptmann, Die Weber (The Weavers 1892), a powerful work depicting the uprising of the Silesian weavers in 1844 which contains the lines, \\"I'll stand it no more, come what may\\". Early career After a period of being unable to find much paid work, they landed a steady and successful engagement at the Village Vanguard jazz club. This led to their discovery by arranger-bandleader Gordon Jenkins and their signing with Decca Records. The group had a big hit in 1950 with Lead Belly's \\"Goodnight, Irene\\", backed with the 1941 song \\"Tzena, Tzena, Tzena\\", which in turn became a best seller. The recording stayed at number one on the charts for 13 weeks. \\"Goodnight, Irene\\" sold one million copies in 1950. In keeping with the audience expectations of the time, these and other early Weavers' releases had violins and orchestration added behind the group's own string-band instruments. Because of the deepening Red Scare of the early 1950s, their manager, Pete Cameron, advised them not to sing their most explicitly political songs and to avoid performing at \\"progressive\\" venues and events. Because of this, some folk song fans criticized them for watering down their beliefs and commercializing their singing style. But the Weavers felt it was worth it to get their songs before the public, and to avoid the explicit type of commitment which had led to the demise of the Almanacs. The new approach proved a success, leading to many bookings and increased demand for the group's recordings. The successful concerts and hit recordings of the Weavers helped introduce to new audiences such folk revival standards as \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" (with guest vocalist Terry Gilkyson), \\"Follow the Drinking Gourd\\", \\"Kisses Sweeter than Wine\\", \\"The Wreck of the John B\\" (aka \\"Sloop John B\\"), \\"Rock Island Line\\", \\"The Midnight Special\\", \\"Pay Me My Money Down\\", \\"Darling Corey\\" and \\"Wimoweh\\". The Weavers encouraged sing-alongs in their concerts, and sometimes Seeger would shout out the lyrics in advance of each line in lining out style. Film footage of the Weavers is relatively scarce. The group appeared as a specialty act in a B-movie musical, Disc Jockey (1951), and filmed five of their record hits that same year for TV producer Lou Snader: \\"Goodnight, Irene\\", \\"Tzena, Tzena, Tzena\\", \\"So Long\\", \\"Around the World\\", and \\"The Roving Kind\\". McCarthy era During McCarthyism, Pete Seeger and Lee Hays were identified as Communist Party USA members by FBI informant Harvey Matusow (who later recanted) and were called to testify to the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1955. Hays took the Fifth Amendment, which allows people not to give evidence against themselves, so they could not be prosecuted without other witnesses. Seeger refused to answer, however, claiming First Amendment grounds, the first to do so after the conviction of the Hollywood Ten in 1950. Seeger was found guilty of contempt and placed under restrictions by the court pending appeal, but in 1961 his conviction was overturned on technical grounds.\\"Sing out, warning! sing out, love!\\": the writings of Lee Hays, by Lee Hays and Steven Koppelman (Amherst and Boston: University of Massachusetts Press, 2003), p. 116. Because Seeger was among those listed in the entertainment industry blacklist publication, Red Channels, all of the Weavers were placed under FBI surveillance and not allowed to perform on television or radio during the McCarthy era. Decca Records terminated their recording contract and deleted their records from its catalog in 1953. Their recordings were denied airplay, which curtailed their income from royalties. Right-wing and anti-Communist groups protested at their performances and harassed promoters. As a result, the group's economic viability diminished rapidly and in 1952 it disbanded. After this, Pete Seeger continued his solo career, although as with all of them, he continued to suffer from the effects of blacklisting. Reformed In December 1955, the group reunited to play a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall. The concert was a huge success. A recording of the concert, The Weavers at Carnegie Hall, was issued by the independent Vanguard Records, and this led to their signing by that record label. By the late 1950s, folk music was surging in popularity and McCarthyism was fading. Yet it was not until the height of the 1960s that Seeger was able to end his blacklisting by appearing on the nationally broadcast CBS-TV variety show, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, in 1967.Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, by David Bianculli, Touchstone, 2009. After the April 1957 LP release of the Carnegie Hall concert, the Weavers launched a month-long concert tour. That August, the group reassembled for a series of recording sessions for Vanguard. As Seeger's college concert bookings grew, the singer felt restricted by his obligations to the group. Vanguard booked the Weavers for a January 15, 1958, session to record a rock-and-roll single. The results were embarrassing and fueled Seeger's frustration. The following month Gilbert, Hays, and Hellerman overruled Seeger about recording a cigarette ad for a tobacco company. Seeger, opposed to the dangers of tobacco and discouraged by the group's apparent sell-out to commercial interests, decided to resign. Honoring his commitment to record the jingle, he left the group on March 3, 1958. Seeger recommended Erik Darling of The Tarriers as his replacement. Darling remained with the group until June 1962, leaving to pursue a solo career and eventually to form the folk-jazz trio The Rooftop Singers. Frank Hamilton, who replaced Darling, stayed with the group nine months, giving his notice just before the Weavers celebrated the group's fifteenth anniversary with two nights of concerts at Carnegie Hall in March 1963. Folksinger Bernie Krause, later a pioneer in bringing the Moog synthesizer to popular music, was the last performer to occupy \\"the Seeger chair.\\" The group disbanded in 1964, but Gilbert, Hellerman, and Hays occasionally reunited with Seeger during the next 16 years. In 1980, Lee Hays, ill and using a wheelchair, wistfully approached the original Weavers for one last get-together. Hays' informal picnic prompted a professional reunion, and a triumphant return to Carnegie Hall on November 28, 1980, which was to be the band's last full performance. They appeared one final time in June 1981 at the Clearwater Festival, in an informal \\"rehearsal.\\" Music style In a 1968 interview, in response to claims that record companies found the Weavers difficult to classify, Seeger told the Pop Chronicles music documentary to \\"leave that up to the anthropologists, the folklorists. ...For you and me, the important thing is a song, a good song, a true song. ...Call it anything you want.\\" A documentary film, The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time! (1982), was released after the death of Hays, and chronicled the history of the group, and the events leading up to the reunion. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of a possible four in his Chicago Sun-Times review and named it one of his Top 10 films for 1982. After disbanding Following the dissolution of the band, Ronnie Gilbert toured America as a soloist and Fred Hellerman worked as a recording engineer and producer. The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001. In February 2006, The Weavers received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Represented by members Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman, they struck a chord with the crowd as their struggles with political witch hunts during the 1950s were recounted. \\"If you can exist, and stay the course ‚Äì not a course of blind obstinacy and faulty conception ‚Äì but one of decency and good sense, you can outlast your enemies with your honor and integrity intact,\\" Hellerman said. Some commentators see the reference to \\"blind obstinacy\\" as a veiled criticism of those who believed blindly in all the actions of the communist party. Lee Hays died in 1981, aged 67, and his biography, Lonesome Traveler by Doris Willens, was published in 1988.Willens, D. Lonesome Traveler: The Life of Lee Hays, W.W. Norton, 1988. Erik Darling died August 3, 2008, aged 74, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, from lymphoma. After a long career in music and activism, Pete Seeger died at the age of 94 on January 27, 2014, in New York City. Ronnie Gilbert died at the age of 88 on June 6, 2015. Last-surviving founding member Fred Hellerman died at the age of 89 on September 1, 2016.

The British Fourteenth Army was a multi-national force comprising units from Commonwealth countries during World War II. As well as British Army units, many of its units were from the Indian Army and there were also significant contributions from West and East African divisions within the British Army. It was often referred to as the \\"Forgotten Army\\" because its operations in the Burma Campaign were overlooked by the contemporary press, and remained more obscure than those of the corresponding formations in Europe for long after the war. For most of the Army's existence, it was commanded by Lieutenant-General William Slim. History=Creation The army was formed in 1943 in eastern India. With the creation of South East Asia Command in late 1943, the Eastern Army which formerly controlled operations against the Japanese Army in Burma and also had large rear-area responsibilities, was split into two. Eastern Command (reporting to GHQ India) took over the rear areas of Bihar, Odisha and most of Bengal. Fourteenth Army, part of the British 11th Army Group, became responsible for operations against the Japanese. The Army's commander was Lieutenant General William Slim. Its principal subordinate formations were IV Corps in Assam and XV Corps in Arakan. During the early part of 1944, the Army also had loose operational control over the American and Chinese Northern Combat Area Command, and the Chindits operating behind enemy lines under Major General Orde Wingate. Defending India In early 1944, the Allies began tentative advances into Burma. The Japanese responded with all-out offensives, intending to destroy the Allies in their base areas. The first Japanese move was a subsidiary attack in Arakan where XV Corps was advancing slowly south. After initial Allied setbacks, in which an Indian divisional HQ was overrun, the surrounded units defeated the Japanese at the Battle of the Admin Box. A vital factor was the resupply of cut-off units by aircraft. The main Japanese offensive was launched on the central front in Assam. While a division advanced to Kohima to isolate IV Corps, the main body attempted to surround and destroy IV Corps at Imphal. Since the Japanese attack in Arakan had already failed, battle hardened units were flown from Arakan to aid the besieged forces in Assam. Also, XXXIII Corps was moved from southern India, where they had been training for amphibious operations, to relieve the garrison at Kohima and then push on to relieve Imphal. The result of the battles was a crushing Japanese defeat. The Japanese suffered 85,000 casualties, mainly from sickness and disease after their supplies ran out. The Allies had been continually supplied from the air, in the largest operation of its type to that date. Retaking Burma In 1945, amphibious operations to recapture Burma had to be cancelled once again because of shortage of resources. Instead, Fourteenth Army was to mount the main offensive. The Army was now subordinated to the headquarters of Allied Land Forces, South East Asia (ALFSEA), and consisted of IV Corps and XXXIII Corps. Since the Army's supply lines by land were long and precarious, air supply was once again to be vital. The Japanese attempted to forestall the Allied attacks by withdrawing behind the Irrawaddy River. Fourteenth Army was nevertheless able to change its axis of advance. IV Corps, spearheaded by armoured and motorised units, crossed the river downstream of the main Japanese forces and seized the vital logistic and communications centre of Meiktila. As the Japanese attempted to recapture Meiktila, XXXIII Corps captured Mandalay, the former capital which was of major significance to the majority Burman population. The result of the Battles of Meiktila and Mandalay, known as the Battle of Central Burma, was the destruction of most of the Japanese units in Burma, which allowed the subsequent pursuit. Fourteenth Army now advanced south. While XXXIII Corps advanced down the Irrawaddy River, IV Corps made the main effort along the Sittang River, covering in a month. It was vital to capture Rangoon, the capital and principal port of Burma, to allow the Army to be supplied during the monsoon. In the event, IV Corps was held up north of Rangoon by sacrificial Japanese rearguards, but its advance caused the Japanese to abandon Rangoon, which was occupied after an unopposed amphibious landing (codenamed Operation Dracula) on 2 May. The Fourteenth Army was supported by the Women's Auxiliary Service (Burma) who provided a canteen service for the troops of Burma Command and moved down through the country with the Army. End of the War Shortly after the fall of Rangoon, the Army headquarters was relieved of responsibility for operations in Burma. A new Twelfth Army headquarters was formed from XXXIII Corps HQ and took over IV Corps. Fourteenth Army HQ now moved to Ceylon to plan operations to recapture Malaya and Singapore. It controlled XV Corps and the newly raised Indian XXXIV Corps. General Slim was promoted to command Allied Land Forces South East Asia. Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey was appointed to command Fourteenth Army. A seaborne landing on the west coast of Malaya, codenamed Operation Zipper, was being prepared but was forestalled by the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender. Zipper was nevertheless mounted unopposed as the quickest method of introducing troops to Malaya to enforce the surrender of the Japanese there and repatriate Allied prisoners of war. Fourteenth Army was renamed Malaya Command on 1 November 1945.Orbat.com, Allied Land Forces South East Asia 1945 , accessed November 2008 Commonwealth Army The Fourteenth Army, like the Eighth Army, was made up from units that came from all corners of the Commonwealth. In 1945 the Fourteenth Army was the largest army in the Commonwealth and the largest army in the world, with about a million men under command.Frank Owen General Bill Slim , Burma Star Association. Paragraph 8 Three African divisions, the 81st, 82nd West African Division and 11th (East Africa) Division were attached to the army. There were many units and formations from the British Army but the majority of the army was built around the British Indian Army, which was stated to be the largest all-volunteer army in history with 2,500,000 men. Order of battle The Fourteenth Army was the Second World War's largest Commonwealth Army, with nearly a million men by late 1944. At different periods of the Second World War it was composed of four corps: *IV Corps *XV Corps *XXXIII Corps *XXXIV Corps A total of thirteen divisions served with the Army: *British 2nd Infantry Division *Indian 5th Infantry Division *Indian 7th Infantry Division *11th (East African) Infantry Division *Indian 17th Infantry Division *Indian 19th Infantry Division *Indian 20th Infantry Division *Indian 23rd Infantry Division *Indian 25th Infantry Division *Indian 26th Infantry Division *British 36th Infantry Division *81st (West Africa) Infantry Division *82nd (West Africa) Infantry Division Some smaller fighting formations also served: *50th Parachute Brigade (India) *268 Indian Motor Brigade *Lushai Brigade *28 Infantry Brigade (East Africa) Also serving with the 14th Army were a range of army, corps and divisional units not organic to the combat divisions.

It spans from January 1, 110 BC through to January 16, 27 BC. Other major historical figures who appear and play prominent parts in the series include Mithridates VI of Pontus, Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, Publius Rutilius Rufus, Quintus Sertorius, Marcus Livius Drusus, Jugurtha of Numidia, Spartacus, Marcus Licinius Crassus, Marcus Tullius Cicero, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, Marcus Porcius Cato, Publius Clodius, Titus Annius Milo, Vercingetorix, Marcus Junius Brutus, Gaius Cassius Longinus, Marcus Antonius, Cleopatra VII of Egypt, Caesarion and Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. Each book in the series features a detailed glossary, hand-drawn illustrations of the major characters, and notes by McCullough detailing her reasoning for portraying certain events in certain ways. The series has a thesis (first introduced in 1939 by Sir Ronald Syme in his epic historical treatise The Roman Revolution): as Rome became more powerful within the Mediterranean world, the old ways of doing things - through the deliberation of various interests, mainly aristocratic and mercantile - became impossibly cumbersome. It became more and more difficult to govern an empire with institutions originally designed to administer a city-state. Certain powerful leaders (especially Marius, Sulla, and Caesar) tried to create a state in which they had autocratic power but also preserved the externals of the old ways. They were opposed by the conservatives (called the optimates by classical historians, though they themselves preferred the title boni or \\"good men\\"). The obtuse or simply ignorant resistance of these reactionaries, who are all (except for Cato) presented as degenerate or self-serving, made the creation of an autocracy necessary. The result was the birth of an imperial monarchy, and a radically different organization of power. McCullough portrays Caesar as an autocrat, great military man, populist, and controversial reformer. She does not portray the death of the Republic as positive, but rather portrays Caesar as a great man and his crossing of the Rubicon as inevitable, given that the alternative was exile, disgrace, and the violation of his dignitas, which was an unthinkable anathema to a Roman Patrician of consular rank. According to McCullough's portrayal, Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon was his last option, his last roll of the dice, as best illustrated by the timeless quote from Caesar: \\"The die is cast.\\" McCullough points out that the translation of the alternative Greek version of his words is \\"Let the dice fly high,\\" which characterises not fatalism (as with the former) but rather risk-taking. The novels of the series are #The First Man in Rome (1990); spanning the years 110-100 BC #The Grass Crown (1991); spanning the years 97-86 BC #Fortune's Favourites (1993); spanning the years 83-69 BC #Caesar's Women (1997); spanning the years 67-59 BC #Caesar (1998); spanning the years 54-48 BC #The October Horse (2002); spanning the years 48-41 BC and #Antony and Cleopatra (2007); spanning the years 41-27 BC McCullough originally decided to end the series with The October Horse because in her opinion the ultimate fall of the Roman Republic took place after the Battle of Philippi, with the death of Caesar's assassins. However, most historians place the end of the Republic a decade later, after the final showdown between Augustus and Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium, in 31 BC. McCullough said that her publisher wanted her to write The Thorn Birds sequels instead of the Roman books because the latter, while popular, did not sell as well. Bob Carr, former premier of New South Wales, publicly campaigned for McCullough to write further Roman novels.Toga party in Maquarie Street, accessed 16 January 2018 In response to lobbying from fans, McCullough completed one more volume, Antony and Cleopatra, released in September 2007 in the UK and December 2007 in the US. Carr argued that she should not continue in chronological order through the Second Triumvirate and the Julio-Claudian and Flavian dynasties, but instead skip ahead to write about the Five Good Emperors. This was always unlikely, as her eyesight deteriorated due to macular degeneration before her death in early 2015.

The Indigo2, code named \\"Fullhouse\\", is a desktop workstation. The Challenge M is a server which differs from the Indigo2 only by a slightly differently colored and badged case, and the absence of graphics and sound hardware. Both systems are based on the MIPS processors, with EISA bus and SGI proprietary GIO64 expansion bus via a riser card. The SGI Indigo is succeeded by Indigo2, which is succeeded by SGI Octane. Overview Indigo2 desktop workstations have two models: the teal Indigo2 and the purple IMPACT model. Both have identical looking cases except color, and sub-model case badging. The available CPU types, the amount of RAM, and graphics capabilities, depend on the model or sub-model variation. There is a special version of the teal Indigo2, called Power Indigo2, with increased FPU (floating point unit) capabilities and specially designed R8000 CPUs. The later IMPACT Indigo2 workstation model gives more computational and visualization power, especially due to the introduction of R10000 series RISC CPU, and IMPACT graphics. Microprocessor All Indigo2 models use one of four distinct MIPS microprocessor variants: the 100 to 250 MHz MIPS R4000 and R4400, and the Quantum Effect Devices R4600 (IP22 mainboard); the 75 MHz MIPS R8000 (IP26 mainboard); and the 175 to 195 MHz R10000 (IP28 mainboard), which are featured in the last produced Indigo¬≤ model, the \\"IMPACT10000\\". Each microprocessor family differs in clock frequency, primary and secondary cache capacity. RAM All SGI Indigo2 models have 12 SIMM slots on the motherboard. The Indigo2 uses standard 36-bit parity 72-pin fast page mode SIMM memory. The memory modules are seated in groups of four. Indigo¬≤ could be expanded to a thermal specification maximum of either 384 MB or 512 MB RAM. The design of the memory control logic in R10000 machines support up to 1 GB RAM, but the thermal output of older generation of DRAM chips necessitate the 512 MB limit. With newer, higher-density and smaller scale modules, 768 MB is easily within heat output specifications. Later, 128 MB modules allow the full 1 GB with eight out of twelve sockets occupied. Storage All Indigo2 models can accommodate two 3.5\\" sized SCSI disk drives and one 5.25\\" sized SCSI CD-ROM drive inside bays on the front of the machine, using specially designed Indigo2 drive sleds with proprietary connectors. All of three drive bays are easily accessed when removing the stylish and recognizable Indigo2 front bezel. The internal SCSI bus speed of the Indigo2 is about 10 megabytes per second. The usual hard disk devices used by the manufacturer are narrow or SCSI-1 5200rpm and 7200rpm drives. All of the Indigo2 drive sleds have classic 50 pin female SCSI-1 connector + standard 4 pin power connector. Advanced U160 and U320 SCSI disk drives can also be used but then one needs appropriate adapters (80/68pin to 50pin SCSI). Networking 10Mb on-board LAN interface, 100Mb LAN options were made by third parties, either via EISA or GIO64 expansion cards. The two most known and widely used Indigo2 network cards are 3Com 3C597-TX 100Mbit EISA Card, and the Phobos G160 GIO64. The second one offers better overall performance due to using the superior GIO64 bus, which also has the effect of reducing the CPU utilization due to DMA transfers. Graphics The graphics options available for the Indigo2 can be divided in two groups: the \\"pre-IMPACT\\" and the \\"MGRAS IMPACT\\" boards. \\"Pre-IMPACT\\" options consist of the following options: SGI XL24, SGI XZ, SGI Elan and SGI Extreme). These options are based on the same \\"Express Graphics\\" architecture from the original SGI Indigo, but feature improved performance. The MGRAS IMPACT (or just \\"IMPACT\\") family include the Solid IMPACT, High IMPACT, High IMPACT AA, and the Maximum IMPACT. These newer boards have a different architecture than the earlier designs. Physically, they appear to be similar to the older graphics options; the low-end Solid IMPACT board takes up a single GIO-64 slot, the mid-range High IMPACT takes up two GIO-64 slots, and the high end Maximum IMPACT takes occupies three. The High IMPACT and Solid IMPACT boards provides the same performance for non-textured tasks, while the Maximum IMPACT provides double the performance. The High IMPACT AA option has the geometry performance of a Maximum IMPACT, but is otherwise the same as the High IMPACT including the pixel fill performance. The IMPACT graphics is the first desktop graphics system from SGI to offer texture mapping acceleration, though only the High IMPACT and Maximum IMPACT had this capability, and comes with 1 MB of texture memory as standard. The Solid IMPACT card is named \\"Solid\\" due to its applications for solid (non-textured) modeling. When expanded by adding a TRAM (Texture RAM) module to the board, the amount of texture memory can be increased to 4 MB. Maximum IMPACT graphics require two of these modules due its two pixel units, although this does not upgrade them to 8 MB, with the two modules merely working in parallel to render twice as fast. At the time of its release, Maximum IMPACT graphics was the world's fastest available top-end desktop visualization solution. A Maximum IMPACT with 4 MB of texture memory and the correct graphics settings can play id Software's Quake 1, 2 or 3 with acceptable frame rates. All graphics options for Indigo2 uses the standard 13W3 connector for connecting the monitor and another connector for 3D stereoscopic glasses. It is possible to have a dual- head Indigo2 by merely adding another Solid IMPACT card. Valid configurations include Solid/Solid, Solid/High, Solid/Maximum. Although there are four GIO-64 slots available and the High IMPACT takes up two, it is not possible to have a High/High configuration. The IMPACT boards draw more power than the GIO-64 bus can deliver, so IMPACT-ready systems have additional power connectors on the expansion riser card, with a separate connection to the power supply. An IMPACT-ready Indigo¬≤ must have an IMPACT-ready riser card, an IMPACT-ready power supply, and a sufficiently recent PROM revision. The Indigo2's replacement, the SGI Octane, offers an upgraded XIO bus but features the same graphics options, albeit in repackaged form.

This class is also popularly referred to as the Fighter, as in Dungeons & Dragons. The class is may sometimes be referred to as a Knight or Bruiser, although in some games Knight is a separate class with a more defensive or support based aspect. Warrior character's skills are centered around strength and physical combat with a wide variety of melee weapons, and the ability to survive while tanking for the group, usually at the cost of agility or range. To aid in this, they can potentially use of some of the most powerful armor and weaponry in the game. As such, a Warrior is a well-rounded physical combatant, but because of the class's reliance on heavy plate armor and expensive weaponry, the cost of managing the Warrior's equipment is typically very high. In some games, the Warrior (or more often the Knight, if it is a separate class) may be able to learn basic magic, but its capabilities in this field are somewhat limited. Avalon: The Legend Lives Avalon: The Legend Lives, a text based multi-player role playing game was the first to offer a fully developed skills and profession system of which the very first player and profession was Zaphod of the Warriors, later renamed the Knights in November 1989. It currently has four iterations of the profession in each of its four player driven cities, The Warriors, Knights, Templars and Cavaliers. This, along with the mage, is Avalon's most ancient profession and remains its simplest to learn to a suitable level where the knight will be able to fight competently and be an effective force in any larger canvas battle. The class lacks the subtlety of other combat-orientated skillsets, but many players accept that drawback in exchange for the simplicity and speed of the knight's progress. EverQuest II In EverQuest II, a Fighter is the archetype for melee classes that specialize in leading combat and taking the brunt of the damage in groups. These classes include Crusaders, Brawlers, and Warriors. Final Fantasy The Warrior and/or Knight („Éä„Ç§„Éà) has appeared in the following games in the Final Fantasy series: * Final Fantasy (Warrior and Knight) * Final Fantasy III (Warrior and Knight) * Final Fantasy V (Knight) * Final Fantasy X-2 (Warrior) * Final Fantasy Tactics (Squire and Knight) * Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (Soldier, Warrior, and Fighter) * Final Fantasy XI (Warrior) The Warrior can be reasonably described as one of the most basic character archetypes in the Final Fantasy series. As a result, there are numerous characters who have appeared throughout the history of the franchise that can be considered roughly analogous to the Fighter. Some of these characters include Firion (Final Fantasy II), Cloud Strife (Final Fantasy VII), Squall Leonhart (Final Fantasy VIII), Adelbert Steiner (Final Fantasy IX), and Tidus (Final Fantasy X). Dungeons & Dragons In Dungeons & Dragons the fighter is a versatile, weapons-oriented warrior class. The fighter is an adept warrior who fights using skill, strategy and tactics. Similar character classes are the paladin, ranger, barbarian and cavalier. Fighter was one of the three classes in the original Dungeons & Dragons game, then called \\"fighting man\\" (the other two were magic-user and cleric). In the 3rd edition of the Dungeons & Dragons game, fighters get bonus feats at every even- numbered level, giving a 20th level fighter more feats than any other character class of equivalent levels. The class covers a huge variety of professions, from knights to bandits. There is a class in Dungeons & Dragons called \\"warrior\\", but it is not intended for the player characters, as it is a weakened version of the fighter class. It is used for non-player characters such as town guards and the like. This is in opposition to some games ‚Äì such as certain installments of the Final Fantasy series ‚Äì where a \\"fighter\\" character can upgrade into a \\"warrior.\\" World of Warcraft The warrior class in World of Warcraft fills both the roles of tanking and damage. The warrior has the widest array of weapons to choose from in the game, being able to equip every weapon type in the game except for wands. Warriors, alongside Paladins and Death Knights, are the only classes that can equip Plate armor, the heaviest armor type in the game. Warriors can use a wide array of combat skills depending on their specific roles in a fight. Arms, Fury, and Protection are the Warrior's specializations. With the release of the third expansion, Cataclysm, the warrior class became available to Blood Elves along with the two newly introduced playable races of Worgen and Goblins, making it possible to play a warrior from any of the thirteen playable races. League of Legends League of Legends has champions with an attribute called \\"fighter\\" who specialize in dealing and receiving heavy amounts of damage at the cost of being less mobile than the usual roles. Fighters are usually physical damage dealers, although a few champions are classified as \\"fighters\\" despite dealing primarily magic damage. They are usually played in the jungle or in the \\"Top\\" lane, and examples include Garen, Riven, and Rumble. Dragon Quest III Dragon Quest III has both a \\"fighter\\" and a \\"warrior\\" class. The latter is equivalent to the fighters and warriors found in other games, but the former is instead a martial arts class, similar to the D&D; monk. Fire Emblem In the Fire Emblem series, Fighters and Warriors both appear as a character class. The Fighter wields only axes, but when it promotes in to warrior, it gains the ability to use bows. Fighters/Warriors in the Fire Emblem series include the characters Bartre, Boyd, Garcia, and more. Fighters and their promoted form, Warriors, are characterized by high strength and HP with moderate speed, while lacking in skill and usually defense. This makes them an easy target for enemy sword-users who are generally faster and more accurate than Warriors (not to mention that the weapon triangle used in the Fire Emblem series gives sword-users an inherent advantage vs. axe-users) as well as magic-users such as Sages or Bishops who tend to have high evade ratings. However, Warriors are excellent at eliminating enemy lance-users since axe-users have an advantage over lance-users according to the aforementioned weapon triangle and a Warrior's high strength allows their attacks to do significant amounts of damage. Other games Warriors appear in many roleplaying games: * EverQuest * The Elder Scrolls * Guild Wars * Gauntlet * Avalon: The Legend Lives * Lineage II * MapleStory * Souls series * RuneScape * Diablo * South Park: The Stick of Truth * Swords and Serpents * Realm of the Mad God * TERA: Rising * Miitopia * NetHack References Category:Character classes Category:1989 introductions ","title":"Warrior (character class)"},{"id":"440184","text":"Bobby Ray \\"Bob\\" Etheridge (born August 7, 1941) is an American politician who was the U.S. Representative for from 1997 to 2011.

Harris' book I Kissed Dating Goodbye (1997), in which he laid out his ideas concerning a Biblically-based Christian approach to dating and relationships helped shape purity culture for many Christian millennials. Harris was lead pastor of Covenant Life Church, the founding church of Sovereign Grace Ministries, in Gaithersburg, Maryland from 2004 until 2015. In 2018, Harris disavowed I Kissed Dating Goodbye and discontinued its publication. The following year, Harris announced that he was separating from his wife, had \\"undergone a massive shift in regard to my faith in Jesus\\" and was not a Christian. Biography Harris is the first of seven children born to Gregg and Sono Harris, pioneers in the Christian homeschooling movement. He is of Japanese descent on his mother's side. His brothers, twins Alex and Brett, lead the youth movement The Rebelution (rebelution is a neologism defined by its creators as \\"a teenage rebellion against low expectations). Harris published New Attitude, a magazine aimed at fellow homeschoolers, from 1994 to 1997. He received no formal seminary or theological training. Harris married Shannon Hendrickson in 1998. In 2019 she began going under the name Shannon Bonne. The pair have had three children. Harris's first book, I Kissed Dating Goodbye, was published in 1997 and has sold 1.2 million copies worldwide. Subsequent books by Harris include Boy Meets Girl (2000), in part describing his engagement to his eventual wife, Shannon; Not Even a Hint: Guarding Your Heart Against Lust, released in 2003 and renamed Sex Is Not the Problem (Lust Is) in 2005; and Stop Dating the Church!: Fall in Love with the Family of God (2004). Harris' book Dug Down Deep (2010) shared his journey towards a love for theology and highlighted his passion for what he called \\"humble orthodoxy\\". In 1997, Harris moved from Oregon to Gaithersburg, Maryland to be a pastoral intern. There, \\"C. J. Mahaney, a charismatic Calvinist and founding pastor of megachurch Covenant Life Church, took Harris under his wing and groomed him to take over the church.\\" Harris was lead pastor of Covenant Life Church from 2004 until 2015. Harris assumed the role of senior pastor at Covenant Life Church at the age of 30. In January 2015, he resigned from that role due to a desire to broaden his views and connect to other parts of Christianity. \\"Harris said the isolation of Covenant Life, and of a small cluster of churches of which it was a part, may have fed leadership mistakes, including the decision of pastors ‚Äî himself among them ‚Äî to handle a child sexual abuse case internally instead of going to police.\\" Harris started Sovereign Grace Ministries' New Attitude Conference for Christian singles in 1999, with inspiration and guidance from Louie Giglio, founder of Passion Conferences. From 1999 until 2011 he continued frequently to organize and lead this conference, although in 2008 it was renamed \\"Next.\\" The primary focus of New Attitude was to equip young Christians with what organizers believe is the biblical truth of the gospel, and to stress the importance of the church in the lives of all Christians. In 2016, Harris stated that he was reconsidering the content of I Kissed Dating Goodbye and apologized to people who said that they had been hurt by its teachings. In 2018, Harris disavowed I Kissed Dating Goodbye and discontinued its publication. His publishers agreed that I Kissed Dating Goodbye and two other follow-up books would not be reprinted once the current stock was depleted. Harris appeared in a documentary film called I Survived I Kissed Dating Goodbye, where he spoke to people who were critical of the book. In July 2019, Harris announced that he and his wife, Shannon Bonne, were separating due to \\"significant changes [that] have taken place in both of us\\". Later that month, Harris announced that he no longer considered himself a Christian. Following Harris's loss of faith, the producers of the documentary about Harris announced they would be halting the distribution of the film.  Books  * I Kissed Dating Goodbye (Updated Version).

It is bounded by Garscadden and Yoker to the west, Victoria Park, Jordanhill and Whiteinch to the east, Jordanhill to the north and the River Clyde (and Braehead beyond) to the south. At the heart of Scotstoun lies Scotstounhill, an enclave of late Victorian and post-war housing centred upon Scotstounhill railway station. Scotstoun (along with the Govan shipyard) is home to BAE Systems Surface Ships (formerly Yarrow Shipbuilders), and to the Glasgow Warriors rugby team.

It includes monsters derived from mythology and folklore, as well as creatures created specifically for D&D.; It describes each with game-specific statistics (such as the monster's level or number of hit dice), and a brief description of its habits and habitats. Most of the entries also have an image of the creature. Along with the Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide, it is one of the three \\"core rulebooks\\" in most editions of the D&D; game. Several editions of the Monster Manual have been released for each edition of D&D.; It was the first hardcover book of the D&D; series. Due to the level of detail and illustration included, it was cited as a pivotal example of a new style of wargame books. Future editions would draw on various sources and act as a compendium of published monsters. History of the Monster Manuals=Early Dungeons & Dragons The first D&D; boxed set did not have a separate Monster Manual but provided listings for monsters in Book 2: Monsters and Treasure, one of the included booklets. After the series was separated into basic and advanced games, the basic game continued to be published in level-based boxes. Monsters of the appropriate level were included in the rulebooks for the various basic game sets (the Basic, Expert, Companion, Master, and Immortal sets). These monsters were later collected in the Rules Cyclopedia, which replaced higher-level the boxed sets, and the Creature Catalogue. Advanced Dungeons & DragonsOriginal Monster Manual= The first publication bearing the title Monster Manual was written by Gary Gygax and published in 1977 as a 108-page book. It was the first hardcover book for any D&D; game, and the first of the core manuals published for the new Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D; version of the game. The Monster Manual was a supplement to the game, intended to describe the standard monsters used in AD&D.; The book was a compendium of more than 350 monsters. Some monsters were new‚Äîothers were compiled and revised from older sources such as Monsters and Treasure, Greyhawk, Blackmoor, Eldritch Wizardry, The Strategic Review and Dragon magazine. Each monster was listed alphabetically with a comprehensive description and full statistics and was, in many cases, supported by an illustration. The cover of the original printing was illustrated by David C. Sutherland III. A softcover version of the Monster Manual was printed in the United Kingdom by Games Workshop in 1978. When the book was reprinted in 1985 it featured new cover art by Jeff Easley. The book remained little changed throughout its fifteen printings up to 1989. Minor changes during the print run included a cover art change to match a new logo and house style and some minor corrections introduced in the 1978 printings. The first edition Monster Manual notably included topless portrayals of some of its female monsters, including the succubus, Type V demons, lamia, and sylph. The first edition was also the first appearance of the mimic. The 1st edition Monster Manual was reproduced as a premium reprint on July 17, 2012. Monster Manual was also reviewed by Don Turnbull who felt that \\"this manual deserves a place on every D&D; enthusiast's bookshelf\\", and praised the explanatory text, stating that it \\"amplifies, where necessary, [the game statistics] and the result is the most comprehensive listing of D&D; monsters you will find, presented in a clarity which is unfortunately all too rare in other sources.\\" Turnbull noted some minor printing errors and felt that some of the drawings were not as good as others, but felt that the book's quality \\"is as high as one can reasonably expect in such a complex matter\\". Turnbull concluded by saying \\"I can do no more than heap high praise on the Monster Manual. If every DM and every player didn't buy it, I would be very surprised. It is without doubt the best thing that TSR have produced so far.\\" Lawrence Schick, author of Heroic Worlds, commented that \\"As nothing is easier to design than new monsters, it has spawned a host of imitations.\\" Reviews * Casus Belli #45 (June 1988) =Fiend Folio= Fiend Folio was published by TSR, Inc. Fiend Folio was primarily made up of monsters described in the \\"Fiend Factory\\" feature of White Dwarf and from various D&D; modules, while some were original creations. It introduced several popular monsters to the D&D; game including drow, githyanki, githzerai, slaad, and death knights. It also featured monsters that were widely ridiculed, such as the flumph, one of the few non-evil creatures presented in the volume. =Monster Manual II= Monster Manual II was a 160-page hardcover book published in 1983, also credited solely to Gygax. The book was a supplement describing over 250 monsters, most with illustrations. Many of the monsters were drawn from scenario modules. The book included random encounter tables for dungeon and wilderness settings built from the Monster Manual, Fiend Folio, and Monster Manual II. Some of its contents were taken from various AD&D; adventure modules, in particular quite a number from S4: Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth, and a dozen new devils that had been first published in the pages of Dragon magazine. Like the Fiend Folio before it, the monsters in Monster Manual II listed the experience point value for each monster within the entry. The Monster Manual II along with the First Edition Unearthed Arcana book featured quite a number of monsters, races, and places from Gary Gygax's home Greyhawk campaign world.  Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition The Monstrous Compendium superseded the Monster Manual with the release of AD&D; 2nd edition. The Compendium was a binder of looseleaf sheets, rather than a hardback book. The first two volumes contained the core monsters of the game. These were followed by many appendices that contained extra monsters for particular campaign settings. The format was intended to help Dungeon Masters (DM) keep handy only the monster statistics needed for a particular game session, as well as to greatly expand the information about each monster, as each was given at least one full page. It would also mean they would only need to purchase core volumes and appendix volumes for the campaigns they wanted, rather than getting a mix of monsters in books. However, the binder format ultimately proved impractical for two main reasons. First, looseleaf pages were not as durable as the hardcover format. As it was a frequently used game aid this was a serious concern. Second, TSR routinely printed different monsters on each side of a sheet, making it impossible to keep monsters in strict alphabetical order. In 1993, the Monstrous Manual was released, compiling all monsters from the first two volumes of the Monstrous Compendium plus many monsters from other sources into a 384-page hardcover book edited by Doug Stewart. More Monstrous Compendium appendices were released as a supplements to the Monstrous Manual in the form of paperback books. They included updated reprints of loose leaf Monstrous Compendium Appendices and new volumes. Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition The Monster Manual for the third edition of D&D; was released in August 2000 as the third of three core books of the system. Monte Cook, Jonathan Tweet, and Skip Williams all contributed to the third edition Monster Manual. Williams is credited with the design of the book. The updates were not intended to make major changes, only to update older monsters to third edition rules. According to Williams, \\"the first item on the agenda was combing through the game's twenty year collection of monsters, and deciding which ones were going into the book... The design team decided to focus on creatures that fit well into classic dungeon style adventures, with extra emphasis on creatures we felt the game needed.\\" In 2001 Monster Manual won the Origins Award for Best Graphic Design of a Roleplaying Game, Adventure, or Supplement 2000. One reviewer called it \\"...an essential reference book, and it is a bargain...\\" The next volumes, Monster Manual II and Fiend Folio were new monster-specific rulebooks. They contain mostly updated monsters from the sourcebooks of earlier editions, though some monsters have almost no overlap with those of their first edition namesakes. There were no new versions of Monster Manual II or Fiend Folio for the 3.5 edition of D&D;, although update errata for both volumes and for the original third edition Monster Manual are available for download from the publisher's website. Dungeons & Dragons version 3.5 In July 2003, the Monster Manual was revised and released again for D&D; v 3.5. The revision was done by Rich Baker and Skip Williams. The 3.5 revision has a slightly different entry on each monster than 3rd edition. Notably, each monster's attack has been divided into attack and full attack entries. When asked about the hardest part in revising the book, Rich Baker replied: \\"The hardest part of the job was probably the sheer volume of the work we needed to do. There are hundreds of monster entries, and each monster has a couple dozen data points to examine and check.\\" Some creatures from the Psionics Handbook and the third edition Manual of the Planes were added to the revised book. Further revision included the addition of an enhanced version of most monsters as an example of advancement (usually either with a template or with class levels). Many monsters also included instructions on how to use them as player characters. The Monster Manual v 3.5 was reproduced as a premium reprint on September 18, 2012. =Monster Manual III= Monster Manual III was published in 2004, and was designed by Rich Burlew, Eric Cagle, Jesse Decker, Andrew J. Finch, Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, Rich Redman, Matthew Sernett, Chris Thomasson, and P. Nathan Toomey. This Monster Manual is notable for its descriptions of where the monsters might be found in the Eberron and Forgotten Realms campaign settings. Chris Perkins explained: \\"Almost all of the monsters in the Monster Manual III are new. We didn't want to give gamers a bunch of beasties they'd already seen, and we found several interesting monster niches to fill. =Monster Manual IV= Monster Manual IV, published July 2006, was designed by Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, Jennifer Clarke Wilkes, Matthew Sernett, Eric Cagle, Andrew Finch, Christopher Lindsay, Kolja Raven Liquette, Chris Sims, Owen K.C. Stephens, Travis Stout, JD Wiker, and Skip Williams. This book was also published in the v3.5 format and used the new stat block format that was introduced in the Dungeon Master's Guide II. Monster Manual IV contained fewer actual monsters than Monster Manual II and III, but had sample lairs and encounters for them, gave stats for classes and templates applied to old creatures, and full page maps. The book also ties into the \\"Year of the Dragons\\" theme that Wizards of the Coast planned out for 2006 with the Spawn of Tiamat, yet contains no new monsters that are considered true dragons. =Special Edition Monster Manual= In October 2006, the Special Edition Monster Manual was released, completing the set of special edition core rulebooks started in 2004 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of D&D.; Like the others, this book was leather-bound with silver- gilt edges and a cloth bookmark. The book was expanded with some new information, 31 new illustrations, and a new index. All collected errata up to its release date were included in this revision. =Monster Manual V= Monster Manual V was released in July 2007, with David Noonan as lead designer, and additional design by Creighton Broadhurst, Jason Bulmahn, David Chart, B. Matthew Conklin III, Jesse Decker, James \\"Grim\\" Desborough, Rob Heinsoo, Sterling Hershey, Tim Hitchcock, Luke Johnson, Nicholas Logue, Mike McArtor, Aaron Rosenberg, Robert J. Schwalb, Rodney Thompson, and Wil Upchurch. This book was published in the same format as the Monster Manual IV, featuring lairs and tactics and, like III and IV, detailing how these new monsters fit into Eberron and Forgotten Realms. Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition The D&D; 4th edition Monster Manual was released with the other core books on June 6, 2008. It featured the demon prince Orcus on the cover. The book was designed by Mike Mearls, Stephen Schubert, and James Wyatt. Monster Manual 2 was released on May 20, 2009 with Demogorgon on the cover; Monster Manual 3 was released on June 15, 2010 featuring Lolth on its cover. Monster Vault was released November 16, 2010 and featured monsters introduced in the Monster Manual revised to the new format that was introduced in Monster Manual 3. Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale was released June 28, 2011 and re-introduced a few new monsters as well as several related to the setting of Nentir Vale. All volumes of the Monster Vault are parts of the Dungeons & Dragons Essentials line of 4th edition D&D; products.  Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition On September 30, 2014, the D&D; 5th edition Monster Manual was the second core book released for the new edition. On the staggered release schedule, Jeremy Crawford wrote \\"our small team couldn‚Äôt finish the books at the same time and also ensure their high quality. [...] We could either stagger their releases, or we could sit on the books until all three were finished\\". Crawford and Mike Mearls co-lead design for the Fifth Edition of Dungeons & Dragons. The cover depicts the beholder Xanathar attacking adventurers in the Underdark. = Reception = In Publishers Weekly's \\"Best-selling Books Week Ending October 13, 2014\\", Monster Manual was #5 in \\"Hardcover Nonfiction\\" and sold 16,956 units. The 5th edition Monster Manual won the 2015 Origins Award for Best Role Playing Supplement and Fan Favorite Role Playing Supplement.http://icv2.com/articles/news/view/31740/2015-origins- award-winners The book won two 2015 gold ENnie Awards: \\"Best Monster/Adversary\\" and \\"Best Interior Art\\".

As of 2010, there were 620,000 members, 6,750 clergy in 4,825 churches worldwide. The PCG is a member of the National Association of Evangelicals, the Pentecostal World Conference and the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America. The church's official publication is The Pentecostal Messenger. History The pastor of a PCG church in Harlan County, Kentucky (1946) First called the Pentecostal Assemblies of USA, the PCG was formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1919 by a group of Pentecostal ministers who had chosen not to affiliate with the Assemblies of God and several who had left that organization after it adopted a doctrinal statement in 1916. John C. Sinclair, an early Pentecostal pastor in Chicago, and a former Assemblies of God presbyter served as the first moderator. The Pentecostal Assemblies of the USA was dissolved in 1922, and the organization resumed under the name Pentecostal Church of God. In 1927, the denominational headquarters relocated to Ottumwa, Iowa; in 1933, to Kansas City, Missouri; in 1951, to Joplin, Missouri in 1951; and in 2012, to Bedford, Texas. Although the relocation to Bedford, TX followed the 2011 Joplin Tornado, the decision to move had started at least three years earlier when the 2009 General Convention voted to explore relocating to a larger metropolitan area. The reason for the move was because of lower income due to declining minister and church membership and Messenger College could no longer support itself. Beliefs The Pentecostal Church of God combines Pentecostal and evangelical doctrines in its Statement of Faith. *Both the Old and New Testament of the Bible is the inspired word of God. *Believes there is one God that exists as a Trinity. *Salvation is available through Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross. *Salvation can be lost if one turns away from God by a human's free will. *Believes in water baptism according to the Trinitarian formula. *After salvation, a Christian can be baptized with the Holy Spirit, which is evidenced by speaking in tongues. *Sanctification is a definite and progressive work of grace. *Heaven and hell are literal places; heaven being for those who have received salvation, and hell for those who have rejected it. *The Christian Church is made of all true Christians. *There are two ordinances: water baptism and the Lord's supper. Water baptism symbolizes identification with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. The Lord's supper is done in remembrance of Christ's death. *Members practice tithing. *Believes that Jesus Christ will return and that his return is imminent. His coming will be personal, pre-tribulational, pre-millennial. Organization The church is led by a General Bishop (formerly called General Superintendent and before that General Moderator and General Chairman) and a General Convention which meets biennially. It is divided into a number of districts, including four Hispanic districts in the United States. Each district is served by a district bishop, previously district superintendent. District conventions meet annually. In 2002, the General Convention came to a consensus to change the title of their overseer from General Superintendent to Bishop. The change was made because internationally, the term bishop is more commonly related to religious leaders than the previous title. Prior to 2011, the International headquarters were located in Joplin, Missouri where a college and a publishing house operated. In 2012 The International Headquarters moved to Bedford, TX and the College, Messenger College, followed and is located in Euless, Texas. As of 2017, the International Headquarters has changed its name to the IMC, International Missions Center. Moderator/Chairman Rev. A. D. McClure: 1927-1933 Rev. G. F. C.

Some have claimed that he is the author known conventionally as Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.Sh. Nutsubidze. \\"Mystery of Pseudo-Dionys Areopagit (a monograph), Tbilisi, 1942; E. Honigmann, Pierre l'Iberian et les ecrits du Pseudo-Denys l'Areopagita. Bruxelles, 1952. His accomplishments include founding the first Georgian monastery in Bethlehem and becoming the bishop of Majuma near Gaza. The oldest Georgian Bir el Qutt inscriptions mention Peter with his father. Life He was born into the royal Chosroid dynasty of the Kings of Iberia (Eastern Georgia)Horn, Cornelia B. and Phenix, Robert R., The Lives of Peter the Iberian, Theodosius of Jerusalem, and the Monk Romanus, Society of Biblical Lit, 2008 and was initially named Murvan (alternatively, Nabarnugios), Prince of Iberia (Kartli). His father, King Bosmarios of Iberia, invited noted philosopher Mithradates from Lazica to take part in Murvan's education. For a time, the child was kept hidden so as not to be delivered as a hostage to the Persians.Lives and Legends of the Georgian Saints, (David Marshall Lang, trans.) In 423, at the age of about five, the prince was sent as a political hostage to Constantinople to ensure the loyalty of Iberia to the Byzantines rather than to the Persians. Here he received a brilliant education under a personal patronage of the Roman empress Aelia Eudocia, wife of Theodosius II. According to his biographer, John Rufus, Peter refused to write to or receive letters from home lest it undermine his ascetic discipline. When he was about twenty, the young prince, together with his mentor Mithradates, left the palace and escaped to make a pilgrimage to Palestine, where he became a monk at Jerusalem under the name of Peter. In 430, he founded his own monastery at Bethlehem (later known as the Georgian Monastery of Bethlehem). In 445, he was ordained as a priest. Accompanied by Mithradates (now called John), he traveled across several countries of the Near East and finally settled in Majuma near Gaza. In 452, he was consecrated bishop of Majuma by Patriarch Theodosius. He only served for six months before some Christians were banished by the decree of the local ruler. Peter escaped to Egypt, where he found refuge in the Enaton, but returned to Palestine a decade later. He gained numerous followers and disciples. According to the medieval sources, he was an author of several famous religious works. However, none of them survived to be written under the name of Peter. He died at Yavneh-Yam, port of ancient Iamnia, in 491 and was buried in his monastery near Gaza. Position vs. Chalcedonian creed Various eastern Churches think that he may have deviated from the Chalcedonian doctrine. These Churches (Armenian, Coptic, etc) believe that Peter the Iberian was a Miaphysite and an anti-Chaldeonian, whereas this view is not shared by the Georgian Orthodox Church. Although his biographies do not discuss this issue, some of the scholars who side with the Armenian sources accept the idea that he was an anti-Chaldeonian, while others do not. For example, David Marshall Lang believes in the possibility that he was a Monophysite Lang, D M. \\"Peter the Iberian and his biographers.\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 1951: 158-168, while Shalva Nutsubidze Georgia, 1942 and Ernest Honingmann Belgium, 1952 believe that he was a Neoplatonic philosopher.

Although officially part of Kentucky at its statehood in 1792, the land did not come under definitive U.S. control until 1818, when Andrew Jackson purchased it from the Chickasaw Indians. Historically, this region has been considered the most \\"Southern\\" of Kentucky. Jackson's Purchase also included all of Tennessee west of the Tennessee River. However, in modern usage the term refers only to the Kentucky portion of the Jackson Purchase. The southern portion is simply called West Tennessee. Map highlighting Kentucky's Jackson Purchase region. Geography The Purchase comprised what is now eight counties, with a combined land area of 3,394.8 square miles (6,202.5 km¬≤), about 6.03 percent of Kentucky's land area. Its 2010 census population was 196,365 inhabitants, equal to 4.53 percent of the state's population. Paducah, the largest city and main economic center, has just over 25,000 residents. The region's other two largest cities, Murray and Mayfield, have about 18,000 and 10,000 residents respectively. The main educational institution is Murray State University.W. W. Olive, \\"Geology of the Jackson Purchase region.\\" Kentucky: Roadlog for the Geological Society of Kentucky field excursion: Kentucky Geological Survey, Ser 10.11 (1972).Darrell Haug Davis, Geography of the Jackson Purchase (Kentucky Geological Society 1923). Counties * Ballard County * Calloway County * Carlisle County * Fulton County * Graves County * Hickman County * Marshall County * McCracken County Economy Though chiefly an agricultural economy, tourism is an important industry in the Purchase, focused chiefly on water-related activities at the TVA-created Kentucky Lake. Together with the portion of the Tennessee River north of Kentucky Dam, it forms the eastern border of the Purchase. History Historically having an agricultural economy tied to cotton plantations and the use of enslaved labor before the Civil War, the Purchase in the years after the war voted as the most staunchly Democratic region in Kentucky. For well over a century, it provided such overwhelming margins for Democratic candidates that Kentucky Democrats routinely called it the \\"Gibraltar of Democracy\\". The most widely circulated newspaper and media outlet in the Purchase, The Paducah Sun, was once named the Paducah Sun-Democrat (see WPSD- TV). Due to changing demographics, most counties in the Purchase in the early 21st century have populations that are overwhelmingly white. Many African Americans left the area after the Civil War and in the Great Migration of the 20th century. During the Civil War, the Purchase was the area of strongest support for the Confederate cause. On May 29, 1861, a group of Southern sympathizers from Kentucky and Tennessee met at the Graves County Courthouse in Mayfield to discuss the possibility of aligning the Purchase with West Tennessee. Most records of the event were lost, possibly in an 1864 fire that destroyed the courthouse.Berry F. Craig, \\"The Jackson Purchase Considers Secession: The 1861 Mayfield Convention.\\" Register of the Kentucky Historical Society 99.4 (2001): 339-361. After the War the region heightened its sense of being \\"Southern\\".Patricia Hoskins, \\"'The Old First is With the South:' The Civil War, Reconstruction, and Memory in the Jackson Purchase Region of Kentucky.\\" (PhD Auburn University 2009) online pp 296-315. In 1907, Fulton County judge Herbert Carr declared in a speech that the Mayfield Convention adopted a resolution for secession, and a historical marker in front of the courthouse also proclaims this as fact. But, the surviving records of the meeting, authored by a Union sympathizer, make no mention of this resolution. Historian Berry Craig states that the convention believed the whole of Kentucky would eventually secede and make unnecessary a separate resolution for the Purchase to break away. Records do show that the convention adopted resolutions condemning President Abraham Lincoln for \\"waging a bloody and cruel war\\" against the South, urging Governor Beriah Magoffin to resist Union forces and praising him for refusing to answer Lincoln's call for soldiers, and condemning the provision of \\"Lincoln guns\\" to Union sympathizers in Kentucky. The convention nominated Henry Burnett to represent Kentucky's First District in Congress. The Mayfield Convention was a precursor to the later Russellville Convention, which formed the provisional Confederate government of Kentucky. Kentucky congressional districts Since the late 20th century, the Purchase has voted for Republicans in national elections while giving higher percentages to candidates of the Democratic Party in state and local elections. This trend is similar to realignment among white conservatives in other parts of the South. , however, the region's delegation in the Kentucky General Assembly included both Republican Party and Democratic Party representatives. For the first time in history, that year the region elected Republicans for both of its two state senators. The Purchase is within Kentucky's 1st congressional district. , 67% of all Purchase voters are registered Democrats and 27% of Purchase voters are registered Republicans. In keeping with the South generally, Purchase Democrats are more conservative than many in the national party. (see also Blue Dog Democrats).

From the 1950s onwards, Taguchi developed a methodology for applying statistics to improve the quality of manufactured goods. Taguchi methods have been controversial among some conventional Western statisticians, but others have accepted many of the concepts introduced by him as valid extensions to the body of knowledge. Biography Taguchi was born and raised in the textile town of Tokamachi, in Niigata prefecture. He initially studied textile engineering at Kiryu Technical College with the intention of entering the family kimono business. However, with the escalation of World War II in 1942, he was drafted into the Astronomical Department of the Navigation Institute of the Imperial Japanese Navy. After the war, in 1948 he joined the Ministry of Public Health and Welfare, where he came under the influence of eminent statistician Matosaburo Masuyama, who kindled his interest in the design of experiments. He also worked at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics during this time, and supported experimental work on the production of penicillin at Morinaga Pharmaceuticals, a Morinaga Seika company. In 1950, he joined the Electrical Communications Laboratory (ECL) of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation just as statistical quality control was beginning to become popular in Japan, under the influence of W. Edwards Deming and the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers. ECL was engaged in a rivalry with Bell Labs to develop cross bar and telephone switching systems, and Taguchi spent his twelve years there in developing methods for enhancing quality and reliability. Even at this point, he was beginning to consult widely in Japanese industry, with Toyota being an early adopter of his ideas. During the 1950s, he collaborated widely and in 1954-1955 was visiting professor at the Indian Statistical Institute, where he worked with C. R. Rao, Ronald Fisher and Walter A. Shewhart. While working at the SQC Unit of ISI, he was introduced to the orthogonal arrays invented by C. R. Rao - a topic which was to be instrumental in enabling him to develop the foundation blocks of what is now known as Taguchi methods. On completing his doctorate at Kyushu University in 1962, he left ECL, though he maintained a consulting relationship. In the same year he visited Princeton University under the sponsorship of John Tukey, who arranged a spell at Bell Labs, his old ECL rivals. In 1964 he became professor of engineering at Aoyama Gakuin University, Tokyo. In 1966 he began a collaboration with Yuin Wu, who later emigrated to the U.S. and, in 1980, invited Taguchi to lecture. During his visit there, Taguchi himself financed a return to Bell Labs, where his initial teaching had made little enduring impact. This second visit began a collaboration with Madhav Phadke and a growing enthusiasm for his methodology in Bell Labs and elsewhere, including Ford Motor Company, Boeing, Xerox and ITT. Since 1982, Genichi Taguchi has been an advisor to the Japanese Standards Institute and executive director of the American Supplier Institute, an international consulting organisation. His concepts pertaining to experimental design, the loss function, robust design, and the reduction of variation have influenced fields beyond product design and manufacturing, such as sales process engineering. Contributions Taguchi has made a very influential contribution to industrial statistics. Key elements of his quality philosophy include the following: #Taguchi loss function, used to measure financial loss to society resulting from poor quality; #The philosophy of off-line quality control, designing products and processes so that they are insensitive (\\"robust\\") to parameters outside the design engineer's control. #Innovations in the statistical design of experiments, notably the use of an outer array for factors that are uncontrollable in real life, but are systematically varied in the experiment.

Bahro was a leader of the West German party The Greens, but became disenchanted with its political organization, left the party and explored spiritual approaches to sustainability. Early life and education Bahro was the eldest of three children of Max Bahro, a livestock-industry consultant, and Irmgard Bahro (n√©e Conrad). Until 1945, the family lived in Lower Silesia: first in the spa town of Bad Flinsberg and then in neighboring Gerlachsheim,This could refer to any of the three villages Ober Gerlachsheim (Grabiszyce G√≥rne), Mittel Gerlachsheim (Grabiszyce ≈örednie), or Nieder Gerlachsheim (Grabiszyce Dolne, all in then district Lauban (de)) where Bahro attended the village school. Towards the end of World War II Max Bahro was drafted into the Volkssturm, and, after his capture, detained as a Polish prisoner. As the Eastern Front approached, the family was evacuated and Bahro was separated from his mother and siblings during the flight (the rest of Bahro's family, with the exception of his father, died of typhoid soon afterwards). Bahro lived with an aunt in Austria and Hesse, spending several months in each location and eventually reuniting with his father, who was managing a widow's farm in Rie√üen (now part of Siehdichum). From 1950 to 1954, Bahro attended high school in F√ºrstenberg (now part of Eisenh√ºttenstadt). Since it was assumed that all high-school students would join the Free German Youth (FDJ), Bahro reluctantly joined in 1950. This was, as he later commented, the only time he did something against his will under pressure. In 1952 he applied for membership in the Socialist Unity Party (SED), which he joined in 1954. Bahro was regarded as intelligent, and graduated from high school with honors. He attended Humboldt University in Berlin from 1954 to 1959 and studied philosophy. Among his teachers were Kurt Hager (who later became the philosopher of the SED), Georg Klaus and Wolfgang Heise. The topic of his thesis was \\"Johannes R. Becher and the relationship of the German working class and its party to the national question of our people\\". Until 1956, Bahro was an admirer of Lenin and Stalin; Khrushchev's leaked \\"secret speech\\" in February 1956 changed his views. He followed the Polish October and the Hungarian Revolution with great interest, expressed his solidarity with the insurgents in a wall newspaper and openly criticized the restricted- information policy of the GDR leadership. As a result of his views, national security spied on him for two years. Party work After passing the government licensing examination, the SED sent Bahro to Sachsendorf (a part of Lindendorf). He edited a local newspaper, Die Linie (The Line) and encouraged the area's farmers to join the LPG agricultural cooperative. In 1959 Bahro married Gundula Lambke, a Russian language teacher. The couple had two daughters (one of whom died at birth) and a son, in addition to Gundula's daughter. In 1960 Bahro was appointed to the party leadership of the University of Greifswald, where he founded the Unsere Universit√§t (\\"Our University\\") newspaper and served as editor-in-chief. The same year saw the publication of his first book, a collection of poems entitled In dieser Richtung (In This Direction). Beginning in 1962, Bahro worked as a consultant for the Corporate Executive Committee of the Union of Science (one of the divisions of the Free German Trade Union Federation) in Berlin; in 1965 he was appointed deputy chief of the Freie Deutsche Jugend (FDJ) student magazine, Forum. During Bahro's tenure with the FDJ he was hampered by conflict with the increasingly restrictive policies of the SED, which made him a target of criticism. Due to the unauthorized publication of an article by Volker Braun,The Germany article gives \\"Kipper Paul Bauch\\" as the name of the piece, but this name doesn't make sense, and it doesn't appear in :de:Volker Braun. Bahro was dismissed as deputy chief in 1967. Evolution of ideas From 1967 to 1977 Bahro worked for a number of companies in the rubber and plastics industry as an organization development specialist. Seeing conditions in the factories soon brought him to the conclusion that the East German economy was in a crisis and the primary reason for this was that workers had little voice in the workplace. He expressed this view in a December 1967 letter to the Chairman of the State Council, Walter Ulbricht, proposing a transfer of workplace responsibility to the workers with grassroots democracy. A few weeks later, the Prague Spring began; Bahro took a lively interest, supported the movement. In May 1968 he was interviewed by a member of the Central Committee, who made it clear that his solidarity with the \\"counter-revolution\\" was no longer tolerated. This led Bahro to develop his ideas systematically, and to publish them. His decision was reinforced by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia on August 21. This was, as Bahro later said, \\"the blackest day\\" of his life and the reason for his final break with the SED. He decided not to make the break publicly, to protect his book project. In 1972 Bahro began part-time work on his dissertation on development conditions of high-school and technical-college groups in the VEBs (state-owned enterprises of the GDR). At the same time, he secretly wrote a thematically broader manuscript which later became The Alternative. In 1973, Gundula filed for divorce; both spouses said later this was as a precautionary measure to protect the children against government reprisals. However, in 1974 Gundula informed state security about the secret book project and handed over a copy of the manuscript; after that, Bahro was under surveillance. In 1975 Bahro submitted his dissertation at the Technische Hochschule Leuna-Merseburg, which was evaluated favorably by three reviewers. The Stasi intervened, engineering two opposing reviews. His work on The Alternative was unhindered, but Bahro was convinced that he would be unable to disseminate his book to the GDR citizenry. In December 1976 he learned that one of his samizdats had fallen into Stasi hands, which prompted him to finish his work quickly. Intermediaries arranged a contract with Europ√§ische Verlagsanstalt, a West German publisher. Swiss musicologist Harry Goldschmidt smuggled the finished manuscript into West Berlin, and copies of the manuscript reached individuals in the GDR by mail. Later in West Germany, Bahro said that the theoretical bases for The Alternative were Karl August Wittfogel's 1957 Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power and earlier Marxist works. He was unable to cite Wittfogel because of the latter's anticommunism. Wittfogel also influenced Bahro's later ecological work. The Alternative The Alternative is divided into three parts: # The non- capitalist path to an industrial society # Anatomy of socialism # Strategy for a communist alternative The introduction begins with the premise that the Communist movement did not lead to the theoretically expected situation, but instead continued on the capitalist path with only superficial changes. \\"Alienation and the subaltern mentality of the working masses continue on a new level.\\" The book analyzes the reasons for this, and offers solutions. The first part is a historical analysis of the development of socialism in the Soviet Union. Bahro concludes that in the Soviet Union (and, consequently, also in countries such as the GDR) not the theoretically expected socialism but a form of proto-socialism had emerged. For the reason, he posits that at the time of the October Revolution the Soviet Union was far from the stage of development presumed in Marx's theory of history. Nevertheless, the path chosen by Lenin was correct. Bahro regards Stalin's subsequent massive industrialization as a necessary development, justifying the party purge as inevitable.Guntolf Herzberg, Kurt Seifert: Rudolf Bahro ‚Äì Glaube an das Ver√§nderbare, Taschenbuch-Ausgabe Berlin 2005, page 177f In the second part, Bahro analyzes the existing social system, which he believes was incorrectly called \\"real socialism\\" when in reality it was still a class society. He detailed how this society worked, and argues that this provided the rationale for the observed economic stagnation. In the third part, he developed solutions, including a call for a new revolution which would transform not only the social circumstances but the people. Its intention is to overcome the subaltern mentality, the \\"form of existence and way of thinking of ordinary people.\\" He demanded the abolition of the division of labor; all should participate in science, art and menial work. Response On 22 August 1977 the West German magazine Der Spiegel published an extract from The Alternative and an interview with Bahro, during which he admitted writing the book. The next day, Bahro was arrested and taken to the Berlin-Hohensch√∂nhausen prison. That evening, West German television stations ARD and ZDF broadcast Bahro's interview. In early September, the book went on sale. The first edition was sold out before delivery, and was translated into other languages. The Alternative sparked debate in the West European left about the nature of socialism. For Herbert Marcuse, Bahro's book was \\"the most important contribution to Marxist theory and practice that has appeared in recent decades\\"; a similar view was expressed by the Trotskyist Ernest Mandel. To Lawrence Krader, Bahro was the \\"conscience of the revolution, the strength of the truth\\". Rudi Dutschke was critical, classifying Bahro as detached from Leninism with too little respect for human rights and calling his suggestions \\"totally unrealistic\\". These analyses were accompanied by a broad wave of publicly expressed solidarity with Bahro, climaxing in a letter by Heinrich B√∂ll and G√ºnter Grass in The Times on 1 February 1978 which was also signed by Arthur Miller, Graham Greene, Carol Stern, Mikis Theodorakis and other celebrities. In the GDR, however, Bahro's recognition was suppressed and he was told nothing of the reaction to his book and subsequent arrest. About half of the copies of The Alternative which Bahro had posted shortly before his arrest in the GDR were intercepted by the authorities. His influence of East German students was limited.Natalia Tsvetkova. Failure of American and Soviet Cultural Imperialism in German Universities, 1945-1990. Boston, Leiden: Brill, 2013 To write and publish a book was, in itself, legal in the GDR; however, Bahro was accused of working for the West German intelligence service (from whom he was thought to have obtained his information). On 30 June 1978 Bahro was convicted in camera of treason and betraying state secrets, and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. Evidence indicates a kangaroo court, with a predetermined verdict; an appeal to the Supreme Court of the GDR filed by defense attorney Gregor Gysi was summarily rejected as unfounded. The verdict immediately sparked violent protests and expressions of solidarity in the West. The Committee for the Release of Rudolf Bahro organized an international conference, held 16 to 19 November 1978 in West Berlin and attended by over 2,000 participants. The depth of solidarity is illustrated by an appeal to the State Council of the GDR in the Frankfurter Rundschau of 11 May 1979, organized by Bahro Committee in 12 countries and signed by a number of celebrities. Bahro was awarded the Carl von Ossietzky Medal by the International League for Human Rights and made a member of the Swedish and Danish chapters of PEN International. On 11 October 1979, the 30th anniversary of the founding of the GDR, Bahro was granted amnesty. On 17 October he was deported with his former wife, their two children and his partner Ursula Beneke to the Federal Republic of Germany, in accordance with his July request. West German work In West Germany Bahro soon joined the nascent Greens party, making a commitment to unite socialist and \\"wertkonservative\\" currents in the new party since compromise was a necessity. A 1980 book formulated elements of a new policy: the relationship between ecology and socialism. Breaking from his position in The Alternative, Bahro now felt that classical Marxism was no longer appropriate. Another new motif in Bahro's thinking was religion. While in custody he had studied the Bible, and when he moved to the west he noticed unhappiness in spite of material prosperity. He interpreted this as a lack of introspection and transcendence, rejecting the traditionally materialistic outlook of socialism. The goal of human emancipation was represented (in different ways) by Karl Marx and Jesus Christ. In this context, Bahro referred to early Christianity and liberation theology. At the beginning of 1980, Bahro studied with Oskar Negt at the Leibniz University Hannover. His thesis appeared as a book, A Plea for Creative Initiative. In 1983, he earned his habilitation in social philosophy. In 1982, Bahro adopted a more radical position due to the contemporary economic crisis. He advocated a restructuring of society in economic, environmental and social-policy terms, which should be linked to a broad retreat from the world market and a move away from capitalist industry. Bahro also became involved in the peace movement, advocating a nuclear-free Europe. Bahro's Dare Commune was an alternative community during the early days of the Greens. He believed that the transformation of society must begin on a small scale, requiring a change in the people themselves and a rediscovery of spirituality. Bahro was influenced by the Congregation of the Benedictines and the mystical experience of God. In 1981 Bahro visited the Korean People's Democratic Republic, where he was received as a guest of the state. He saw this as his most important trip, to a state he admired with a system \\"to satisfy all the basic requirements of security\\". As part of a lecture tour of the United States in summer 1983, Bahro enjoyed several weeks at Rajneeshpuram with Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho). After the Green Party entered the Bundestag for the first time in March 1983, the question arose whether they would join a coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (the SPD) or remain in opposition. Bahro strongly favored the latter option (which placed him in opposition to Joschka Fischer), and believed in renewal rather than reform. In his December 1984 \\"Hamburg speech\\", Bahro made a comparison with the political and social situation in the Weimar Republic: At that time, there had also been a broad movement in society which was dissatisfied with prevailing conditions and wanted change. What mattered now was to prevent the errors and political disasters of the past. In the Weimar Republic, the \\"brown\\" pole of the political spectrum (the Nazis) overpowered the left with \\"nationalist mythology in disguise; therefore, resistance to capitalist development\\" could not begin. Bahro's \\"popular uprising\\" could occur this time without violence, but it was important that the Greens \\"are not lost\\" in the system. Bahro also called for the conquest of the right-left divide; to escape its minority position, the Greens should also \\"penetrate the territory of the Bavarian CSU\\". Bahro's Hamburg speech ended with the allegation that Joschka Fischer's supporters had a lust for power, a situation that could lead to civil war and subsequent dictatorship. During the summer of 1985 Bahro left the Greens and focused on his new book, which was published in 1987 as Logic of Salvation. In it he described a \\"logic of self-extermination\\" and its consequences for humanity at present, presenting a \\"logic of life\\" requiring a \\"leap in consciousness\\" and a withdrawal from the industrial \\"mega-machine\\". It was important to implement a \\"rescue policy\\", before the worsening environmental crisis leads to an emergency government. Bahro called for long- term goals, the elimination of short-term tactics and government decentralization. He advocated an \\"invisible church\\", which would provide the necessary spiritual dimension. As a conservative on the left, he noted common ground with CDU politician and critic Kurt Biedenkopf. Inspired by Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, Bahro hoped for a \\"prince of environmental change\\" and suggested the establishment of a consensus-oriented body similar to the British House of Lords. The book met a mostly negative response, and Bahro's references to a prince and an invisible church were criticized. In 1986, Bahro held \\"learning workshops\\" at his home in Worms, which featured discussion of his ideas and meditation. He met Beatrice Ingermann, who had been conducting a similar project since 1983 that was also a community in the Eifel. Bahro joined her group; they married in 1988, and had a daughter. In Berlin after the fall of the Wall Seeing the rapid decline of the GDR, at the end of 1989 Bahro went to East Berlin to fight against the feared \\"sellout of the GDR,\\" its absorption by the Federal Republic. He wanted to work to ensure that the regime could keep its autonomy and maintain what he thought was its greatest political achievement: the primacy of politics over economics. On 16 December 1989, Bahro had the opportunity of speaking to the assembled delegates of the extraordinary party conference of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, whose chairman had, a week ago, been his former legal counsel, Gysi. The main item on the agenda was whether the party should continue or be dissolved. What was finally decided was that the party should continue under a new name: Socialist Unity Party of Germany ‚Äì Party of Democratic Socialism (German: Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands ‚Äì Partei des Demokratischen Sozialismus, abbreviated SED-PDS). Bahro's request to address the conference as a guest speaker found only a slight majority (54%), and he was granted only 30 minutes, not the requested 45 minutes. Bahro was annoyed at this and had to improvise. After reading out the names of all the people who had helped him with his book, Die Alternative, he criticized the previous speaker, Minister President and Deputy Party Chairman Hans Modrow, as well as Karl Marx, Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. He went on to present his vision of a \\"socio- ecological\\" restructuring of the GDR. His radical environmental ideas, which were hardly known in the GDR at that time, were far removed from the problems that interested the delegates, and his polemical introduction provoked fierce resentment. Bahro concluded that he no longer had anything in common with this party. In the spring of 1990, he began setting up an \\"Institute for Social Ecology\\" at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Instead of the usual discussion of the ecological crisis, he wanted this institute to address the issue holistically and, above all, study the deeper social and cultural causes of the crisis and develop practical alternatives. Bahro thus set up his own school of social science that is not to be confused with others that also go by the name of social ecology. On 16 June 1990, again represented by Gysi, Bahro was rehabilitated by the Supreme Court of the GDR. On 15 September, shortly before the end of the GDR, the Minister of Education and Science appointed him associate professor of social ecology at Humboldt University. From the winter semester 1990/1991, Bahro regularly held lectures on issues of the environmental crisis, where he further developed the theories that he had put forward in his book Logik der Rettung (published in English as Avoiding social and ecological disaster: the politics of world transformation: an inquiry into the foundations of spiritual and ecological politics). The lectures, to which he frequently invited guest speakers, were aimed at students in all years and also attracted an audience from outside the university. In the first years, the main lecture hall (auditorium maximum) of the university was consistently full, and this also resulted in increased sales of his book on which the lectures were based. However, the Institute remained a temporary arrangement that could only exist thanks to financial support from the Schweisfurth Foundation. It was not until 1995 that the institute was integrated into the university as a working group of the Faculty of Agriculture and Horticulture. In 1990, there were accusations that Bahro was striving for \\"eco-dictatorship\\". This accusation was made particularly aggressively by the ', a right-wing organization founded in Zurich which, in a work entitled The Fascism of the New Left, claimed that Bahro's real goal was an \\"eco-fascist dictatorship\\". Bahro indignantly denied this but soon found himself confronted with more accusations of this nature. The accusations were based on quotations from his book Logik der Rettung. In 1992, a former party colleague of his, Jutta Ditfurth joined the debate when, in her book Feuer in die Herzen [Putting Fire in the Hearts], she accused him of turning to esoteric, authoritarian and nationalist ideas. In addition to his activities in Berlin, until 1991 Bahro also active in the Lernwerkstatt [Learning Workshop] a non-profit organization in Niederstadtfeld, and he planned similar experiments with new sustainable living and economic systems in the former GDR. A conversation with the Minister-President of Saxony, Kurt Biedenkopf, in the summer of 1991 led to the socio-ecological futurology project LebensGut in the village of Pommritz, near Bautzen. There, the socio-ecological research begun at the Humboldt University is also being continued, mainly by Bahro's former associate Maik Hosang. In September 1993, Bahro's wife Beatrice committed suicide following a marital dispute. He was so devastated that he had to cancel a semester of lectures. In the spring of 1994, he also became physically ill and in the autumn of that year he was diagnosed with non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bahro was convinced that his illness was the consequence of traumatic experiences such as the suicide of his wife and resisted conventional therapy, instead trying various alternative methods of diagnosis and therapy and temporarily moving into a monastery. Only after his condition deteriorated dramatically did he agree to another course of chemotherapy. In May 1995, on his sickbed, he married his girlfriend and companion Marina Lehnert, who had been caring for his daughter for some time. After a year's break due to illness, in summer 1996 Bahro resumed teaching, but only to a limited extent. He gave his last lecture in July 1997. After that, he caught pneumonia and the cancer broke out again. Rudolf Bahro died in Berlin on 5 December 1997 and was buried at the Dorotheenstadt cemetery in Berlin.

She is noted for her portrayals of the life of women and is ‚Äú...often reduced to the bold sexuality of her writing, Keun was a significant author of the late Weimar period and die Neue Sachlichkeit.\\" She was born into an affluent family and was given the autonomy to explore her passions. After her attempts at acting ended at the age of 16, Keun began working as a writer after years of working in Hamburg and Greifswald. Her books were banned by Nazi authorities but gained recognition during the final years of her life. Biography Irmgard Keun was born on 6 February 1905 in Charlottenburg (at the time an independent town, now part of Berlin) to Eduard and Elsa Keun. Her father was an agent for a company that imported petrol, her mother a housewife. Keun later recalled her mother as \\"stark hausfraulich eingestellt, auf eine sehr schauerliche Weise\\" (quite domestically inclined, in a very horrible way).[1] She and her family, including her brother Gerd, born in 1910, lived in the city until 1913, when they moved to Cologne. There Keun attended a Lutheran girls' school, from which she graduated in 1921. She worked as a stenotypist, but also attended acting school in Cologne from 1925-1927. Although she had stage roles in Greifswald and Hamburg, these were only somewhat successful, and she decided to abandon her acting career in 1929. Encouraged by Alfred D√∂blin, she turned to writing. In 1931 Keun's first novel Gilgi, eine von uns was published and became a success. In 1932 a second novel Das Kunstseidene M√§dchen (The Artificial Silk Girl) came out. Although there were allegations that she had plagiarised a novel by Robert Neumann (a claim endorsed by her erstwhile promoter Kurt Tucholsky - and disproven only much later), this novel also became a success.Letter by Tucholsky to Keun, 16 July 1932, in which he states that while, on first reading the novel he had recognised similarities to Anita Loos' Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, it was only that after other people pointed him to Neumann's novel Karriere, that he realised the plagiarism.Hiltrud H√§ntzschel discusses this in detail and concludes that the claim was unjustified, p. 41-43 In 1932, Keun married the writer and director . They divorced in 1937, as she claimed after 1945, because he was a Nazi sympathizer. However, there is evidence that she stayed in close touch with him well after 1933, and that the reasons may have been much more personal in nature.see Hiltrud H√§ntzschel, p.45 In 1933/34, her books were confiscated and banned by the Nazis. In the spring of 1933 she met and fell in love with the Arnold Strauss, a Jewish doctor who wanted to treat her for her alcoholism. Strauss, as a Jew, lost his position at the Berlin hospital that employed him and went to the USA in 1935; however they stayed in touch (and many of their letters survive).see the Strauss Family Papers at Old Dominion University Keun continued to publish in Germany after 1935, occasionally using pseudonyms, but after she was finally banned from publishing by the authorities - and after she had tried to sue the government for loss of income, and her final appeal to be admitted to the \\"Reichsschrifttumskammer\\" (the official author's association of Nazi Germany) was refused - she went into exile to Belgium and later the Netherlands in 1936. Between sometime in 1936 and 1938 she lived with writer Joseph Roth, while, at the same time pursuing her relationship with Strauss in the US. Invited by Strauss, she even visited him in Norfolk in 1938, yet returned to Europe that same year. In 1940 she returned to Cologne from the Netherlands, where she lived through the war years using an alias. How she managed to do this remains unclear. Keun claimed she seduced a Nazi official in the Netherlands and, however that may be, her cover back in Germany may have been helped by the fact that the British Daily Telegraph (among others) reported her suicide in Amsterdam on 16 August 1940. There is not a lot known of the late Weimar author Irmgard Keun but what we do know is from bits and pieces of history scattered about. In an interview, Keun's daughter, Martina Keun- Geburtig, answers the question if her mother was a happy woman, ‚ÄúWell, she always said that the Nazis took her best years. Starting in 1933 her success was abruptly ended through the book-burning up until ‚Äò45, ‚Äò46. It‚Äôs a pretty long time‚Ä¶‚Äù.see Hiltrud H√§ntzschel, p.101-113 Keun received great acclaim for her sharp-witted books, most notably from such well-known authors as Alfred D√∂blin and Kurt Tucholsky, who said about her, \\"A woman writer with humor, check this out!\\". Keun utilizes her characters from her novels to highlight and critique the social problems of the early 1930s. Keun's biggest criticisms of consumerism and the complexity of a feminine identity are displayed through the female protagonists' relationships with men. Breaking the archetypal mold, Keun's characters offer depth to the feminine identity and challenge the idea that a woman must be placed into a category. For example, \\"Keun‚Äôs representative novels of the New Woman‚Äôs experience during the Weimar Republic, Gilgi‚Äîeine von uns (1931) and Das kunstseidene Ma¬®dchen (1932), feature two such young stylized New Women, Gilgi and Doris, who try to shape their lives in the aforementioned image by taking their cues from the popular media\\". In the case of Das Kunstseidene M√§dchen (The Artificial Silk Girl), Keun tells the story from Doris' perspective, which she does to give the reader \\"insights into the social injustice of Weimar Berlin's class and gender hierarchy\\". Keun's novel reflects critically on these discourses by casting its heroine's sentimental journey in terms of an education in vision. She counted among her friends such literary notables as Egon Erwin Kisch, Hermann Kesten, Stefan Zweig, Ernst Toller, Ernst Weiss, and Heinrich Mann. From 1936 to 1938, she had a romantic relationship with Joseph Roth,unsinkable Irmgard Keun a relationship that at first had a positive effect on her literary output. She worked together with Roth, traveling with him to various cities such as Paris, Wilna, Lemberg, Warsaw, Vienna, Salzburg, Brussels and Amsterdam. After the German invasion of the Netherlands, she returned in 1940 to Nazi Germany. Protected by false reports of her own suicide, she lived there undercover until 1945.Life of Kaun In the 1960s, her life was overshadowed by alcoholism and homelessness in spite of help from the literary community. In 1966, she was put under tutelage and committed to the psychiatric ward at the Bonn State Hospital, where she remained until 1972. In 1977, she was re-discovered after an article in Stern magazine. From 1979 onwards, her financial situation recovered thanks to new editions of her work. She died in Cologne in 1982 of lung cancer.

A deserter from the German army in World War II and a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Harich became a professor of philosophy at Humboldt University in 1949. He was arrested in 1956 and sentenced to ten years in prison for the \\"establishment of a conspiratorial counterrevolutionary group.\\" He was released in 1964, after eight years, and rehabilitated in 1990. In 1994 he joined the Party of Democratic Socialism. His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof III der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. III of the congregations of Jerusalem's Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor.  Life  Wolfgang Harich was born in K√∂nigsberg, East Prussia, on 9 December 1923, into an upper-class literary educated family. His father was a writer Walter Harich and his mother was Anne-Lise Wyneken, the daughter of Alexander Wyneken, editor in chief of the K√∂nigsberger Allgemeine Zeitung. Harich became known as one of the stronger voices in post war debates at a very young age in Germany. He firmly believed in uniting war torn Germany. He studied philosophy at the Humboldt University of Berlin and, upon graduation, became professor of philosophy and taught at the same university. His strong voice eventually led him to be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years for conspiracy. Although he only served eight years, Harich was kept in solitary confinement for more than seven of those eight years, which took a large toll on his mental health, giving him severe depression and dizziness. He emigrated to Austria in 1979, moved to West Germany in 1980, and returned to the Besseres Deutschland or \\"Better Germany\\" in 1981. Although he had a heart attack in July 1960, he fought through it and recovered, surviving until 15 March 1995, when he died at the age of 71.  Education  Harich studied philosophy at Humboldt University in East Berlin with Nicolai Hartmann and Eduard Spranger, graduating in 1951. He began giving lectures in 1949 on Marxist Philosophy, and in 1952 he became the University's Professor of Philosophy. Before his final studies at Humboldt, he had entered the Kammer Der Kunst Schaffenden, Department of Creative Artists, in June 1945 as Paul Wegener's personal assistant. This experience gave him the ability to become considered as one of Berlin's best theater critics.  Political views  Harich was a convinced communist, and an environmentalist. He joined Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (KPD), the Communist Party of Germany, then later joined Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands (SED), the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which later became the ruling party of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in 1946. As a twenty-year-old, Harich was drafted into the Wehrmacht, but left and joined an anti-Nazi group in 1944. He was a Stalinist until the early 1950s; he wrote in a memoir of recalling \\"crying an ocean of tears over Stalin's death.\\" Yet, after the removal of the Stalinists, he moved on to wanting a neutralized and united, democratic socialist Germany. His beliefs and principles were driven by self-transformation, and he was mostly interested in Marxist philosophy. Harich was looking for a \\"third way\\" between Stalinism and capitalism, he wanted a \\"humanistic socialism\\" in a reunified Germany. He established and engaged his friends, opponents, and social democrats in controversy in West Germany to argue that the GDR should make reforms to further the reunion of Germany. His sweeping reform proposals represented the only Party attempt at the internal restructuring of the GDR before it collapsed. He pushed for free elections, the admission of legal opposition groups, and the dissolution of the Stasi, the secret police of General Erich Mielke, leading others to often look at his ideas as Utopian, but was granted the title of \\"most brilliant head in the SED.\\" Agreeing with Bloch and Luk√°cs, Harich criticized Stalinism and believed in renewing Marxism from a humanist and naturalist point of view. Harich produced a manifesto and presented his ideas in October‚ÄìNovember 1956 to Georgy Pushkin, the Soviet ambassador and to Walter Ulbricht, the first secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, himself. This presentation and his notorious loose tongue led him to being convicted of \\"counterrevolutionary plotting,\\" indicted with \\"formation of an enemy group\\" on behalf of the West German SPD, and branded a revisionist. He was arrested on 29 November 1956, indicted in March 1957 and sentenced to imprisonment in July 1957. He remained in jail until released in December 1964. Harich referred to his years in jail as his Rufmord, or reputation-murder, and felt guiltless because all he did was \\"just talk.\\" He actually thanked the Stasi for their vigilance in arresting him, for without their attention, he would not have been given ten years in jail, and instead he would be looking at the noose. This quote of Harich's was recorded at his hearing, He had later testified against a former friend Walter Janka, head of the Aufbau Publishing Company, creating a new \\"text book\\" characterized enemy. \\"Janka vs. Harich: the worldly older man vs. the young genius, the practical man vs. the classically educated intellectual, the tough working-class war hero vs. the bourgeois academic utopian.\\" Janka refused to ever meet Harich again after the trial, insisting that Harich‚Äôs false testimony landed him three years in Bautzen, the most horrific jail for political criminals. After being released from jail, Harich was allowed to resume his previous literary work and became an editor of Akademie Verlag in Berlin in 1965, even though it took 33 years for the court to pronounce him \\"rehabilitated\\" in April 1990. Having spent most of his time in jail in solitary confinement, Harich emerged in 1964 as a hard-line Stalinist and enthusiastic critic of all modernist experimentation, even labeling Friedrich Nietzsche as a \\"Nazi worshipper.\\" and insisting that his legacy was nothing but \\"a giant trash bin.\\" Harich focused on more environmental political problems in the 1970s. In 1975 he undertook an impractical campaign for a state communism in the service of environmental protection, in hopes of making some change. Also, after the Wende (change) in Germany in 1989, he became the chairman of the Alternative Enquete Komission (AEK) which conducted research on the history of the GDR, and aligned himself with the self-proclaimed Mikhail Gorbachev reform communists after 1990.  Literary work  Harich became accomplished and created a name for himself at a very young age. He followed in his father's footsteps and became a Jean Paul scholar, writing two books dealing with Paul's epistemology and poetic vision, which are arguably his finest scholarship. In 1946, he worked for the newspaper of the soviet occupation regime, T√§gliche Rundschau; and he was also a journalist for the French-licensed daily. He became editor-in-chief of the journal Deutsche Zeitschrift f√ºr Philosophie along with Arthur Baumgarten, Ernst Bloch, and Karl Schroter in 1953. In the same year, Harich also received the prestigious Heinrich Mann Prize for editing and journalism, conferred by the GDR Academy of Fine Arts. Upon his arrest, Der Spiegel devoted its cover story to Harich in 1956, stating that West German intellectuals regarded him highly and saying, \\"despite his youth, probably the only GDR intellectual capable of calling into question the current foundation of the communist state, the doctrine of hard-frozen Stalinism.\\" They even called him \\"an intellectual phenomenon\\" and \\"a pure intellect on two feet.\\" In the 1970s, Harich published Communism without Growth: Babeuf and the Club of Rome with Rowohlt Verlag, which argued that a neo-Stalinist state with dictatorial authority to enforce environmental standards could avert an ecological catastrophe.

Biography Josef Hofmann was born in Podg√≥rze (a district of Krak√≥w), in Austro-Hungarian Galicia (present-day Poland) in 1876. His father was the composer, conductor and pianist Kazimierz Hofmann, and his mother the singer Matylda Pindelska. He had also an older sister - Zofia Wanda, b. June 11, 1874 also in Krakow. Throughout their childhood, their father, Kazimierz, was married to Aniela Teofila n√©e Kwieci≈Ñska (born on January 3, 1843 in Warszawa),http://www.sejm-wielki.pl/b/teatr.62667.1 who, after moving to Warsaw in 1878 with her husband, died there on October 12, 1885,https://szukajwarchiwach.pl/72/158/0/-/109/skan/full/h1iFbxPFClZxBcBRH8PACwentry 1392. Then the next year Kazimierz Miko≈Çaj Hofmann married on June 17, 1886, Matylda Franciszka Pindelska - the mother of his children, (daughter of Wincenty and Eleonora n√©e Wyszkowska, b. in 1851 in Krak√≥w) in the Holy Cross Basilica in Warszawa.https://szukajwarchiwach.pl/72/158/0/-/111/skan/full/Oks6RSbV- WuUwXmnC0JXqQ In order to ensure their son Josef a thorough musical education, the whole family moved to Berlin from 1886. Josef Hofmann, a child prodigy, gave a debut recital in Warsaw at the age of 5, and a long series of concerts throughout Europe and Scandinavia, culminating in a series of concerts in America in 1887-88 that elicited comparisons with the young Mozart and the young Mendelssohn.Harold Schoenberg. The Greatest Pianist of His Time. New York Times, 18 April 1976. Anton Rubinstein took Hofmann as his only private student in 1892 and arranged the debut of his pupil in Hamburg, Germany in 1894. Hofmann toured and performed extensively over the next 50 years as one of the most celebrated pianists of the era.Harold C. Schonberg, The Great Pianists from Mozart to the Present, 2nd ed., Simon & Schuster, 1987 In 1913, he was presented with a set of keys to the city of St. Petersburg, Russia. As a composer, Hofmann published over one hundred works, many of those under the pseudonym Michel Dvorsky, including two piano concertos and ballet music. He made the United States his base during World War I and became a US citizen in 1926. In 1924, he became the first head of the piano department at the inception of the Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, and became the Institute's director in 1927 and remained so until 1938. He was instrumental in recruiting illustrious musicians such as Efrem Zimbalist, Fritz Reiner, Marcella Sembrich, and Leopold Auer as Curtis faculty. Hofmann's pupils included Jean Behrend, Abram Chasins, Abbey Simon, Shura Cherkassky, Ezra Rachlin, Nadia Reisenberg (see ), and Harry Kaufman. While not a pupil, Jorge Bolet benefited from Hofmann's interest. In 1937, the 50th anniversary of his New York debut performance was celebrated with gala performances including a \\"Golden Jubilee\\" recital at the Metropolitan Opera, New York City. In 1938 he was forced to leave the Curtis Institute of Music over financial and administrative disputes. In the years from 1939 to 1946, his artistic eminence deteriorated, in part due to family difficulties and alcoholism. In 1946, he gave his last recital at Carnegie Hall, home to his 151 appearances, and retired to private life in 1948. He spent his last decade in Los Angeles in relative obscurity, working on inventions and keeping a steady correspondence with associates. As an inventor, Hofmann had over 70 patents, and his invention of pneumatic shock absorbers for cars and airplanes was commercially successful from 1905 to 1928. Other inventions included a windscreen wiper, a furnace that burned crude oil, a house that revolved with the sun, a device to record dynamics (U.S. patent number 1614984) in reproducing piano rolls that he perfected just as the roll companies went out of business, and piano action improvements adopted by the Steinway Company (U.S. patent number 2263088). He moved to Los Angeles in 1939. Hofmann died of pneumonia on February 16, 1957 at a nursing home in Los Angeles, California. He had four children. His second wife, Betty Short, had previously been one of his pupils. Legacy The Josef Hofmann Piano Competition, co-sponsored by the American Council for Polish Culture and the University of South Carolina Aiken was established in his honor in 1994.bHendrix, Denise (25 May 1995) \\"Piano Competition Begins Tonight\\" The Augusta Chronicle (Georgia) p. C-1 Career as a child prodigy Hofmann as a young man at the keyboard Anton Rubinstein heard the seven-year- old Hofmann play Beethoven's C minor Piano Concerto in Warsaw and declared him to be an unprecedented talent .Henry Charles Lahee. Famous Pianists of Today and Yesterday. Boston L.C. Press, 1900 (re-print 1906). Book contributor: Music - University of Toronto. At Rubinstein's suggestion, German impresario Hermann Wolff offered career management and offered to send the boy on a European tour, but Hofmann's father refused to let the boy travel until he was nine years old. At that age, Hofmann gave concerts in Germany, France, Holland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Great Britain. At the age of 12, young Josef Hofmann was probably the first pianist of note to record on Edison's phonograph; Hans von B√ºlow recorded a Chopin Mazurka on Edison's improved phonograph the same year, i.e., 1888. Music & Letters. vol. 37, no. 4, Oct. 1956, pp. 380‚Äì382 In 1887, an American tour was arranged, with three months of performances that included fifty recitals, seventeen of which were at the Metropolitan Opera House. Yet soon after, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children stepped in, citing the boy's fragile health. However, as per the contract that had paid Hofmann $10,000, he was legally obliged to complete the tour. The contract was rendered void by Alfred Corning Clark who donated $50,000 and, in turn, legally forbade Hofmann to perform in public until he turned 18 years old. The final segment of the tour was cancelled and the family returned to Potsdam, outside Berlin. This marked the end of Hofmann's child prodigy years. (See and for details.) Education in music Clark's donation enabled Hofmann to continue individual study in science and mathematics, and he continued to take music lessons from Heinrich Urban (composition) and with the pianist and composer Moritz Moszkowski. In 1892, Rubinstein accepted Hofmann as his only private pupil, the two meeting for 42 sessions in Dresden's Hotel d'Europe. Initial lessons, a week apart, included ten Bach Preludes and Fugues and two Beethoven sonatas, from memory. Hofmann was never allowed to bring the same composition twice, as Rubinstein said as a teacher he would probably forget what he told the student during the previous lesson. Rubinstein never played for Hofmann, but gave ample evidence of his pianistic outlook during many recitals the boy heard. In a three-day period Hofmann heard in Berlin's new Bechstein Hall recitals by Hans von B√ºlow, Johannes Brahms and Rubinstein, and commented on their radically different playing. Rubinstein arranged Hofmann's adult debut on March 14, 1894, in Hamburg's Symphonic Assembly Hall, the piece being Rubinstein's Piano Concerto No. 4 in D minor, with the composer conducting. After the concert, Rubinstein told Hofmann there would be no more lessons, and they never saw each other again. Rubinstein returned to Russia and died later that year. In later years Hofmann referred to his relationship with the titanic Russian master as the \\"most important event in my life.\\". Hofmann at the end of his career By the early 1930s, Hofmann had become an alcoholic but he retained exceptional pianistic command throughout this decade; Rudolf Serkin and a young Glenn Gould have recounted magical impressions created on them by Hofmann's concerts in mid-and-late 1930s. After his departure from the Curtis Institute in 1938, a combination of his drinking, marital problems and a loss of interest in performing caused a rapid deterioration in his artistic abilities. Commenting on Hofmann's sharp decline, Sergei Rachmaninoff said, \\"Hofmann is still sky high ... the greatest pianist alive if he is sober and in form. Otherwise, it is impossible to recognize the Hofmann of old\\".Sergei Bertensson and Jay Leyda. Rachmaninoff: A Lifetime in Music. Indiana University Press, 2001. Oscar Levant wrote, \\"one of the terrible tragedies of music was the disintegration of Josef Hofmann as an artist. In his latter days, he became an alcoholic. ‚Ä¶[H]is last public concert ‚Ä¶ was an ordeal for all of us\\".Oscar Levant. The Unimportance of Being Oscar, Pocket Books 1969 (reprint of G.P. Putnam 1968), p. 124. . Technique and style Josef Hofmann playing solos in the Metropolitan Opera House gala on November 28, 1937, the 50th anniversary of his American debut. Hofmann's views on technique and musicianship are explained in his book Piano Playing with Questions Answered. He had small but exceptionally strong hands. Steinway eventually built for him custom keyboards with slightly narrower keys (pianist/critic Stephen Hough has commented on how Hofmann's mechanical understanding of the Steinway piano action set him apart from all other pianists.) His concert instruments had subtle action changes for faster repetition, two pedals rather than three (he liked the older Steinway trap work geometry), faultless regulation, and were accompanied on tours by his own recital chair, built with a short folding back and a 1¬Ω\\" slope from rear to front. After playing Hofmann's special concert instrument in the Steinway New York basement, Gunnar Johansen reported that the piano had the biggest sonority of any he had ever tried. Unlike Rubinstein, Hofmann sat quietly at the piano, striking the keys in a kneading manner. His finger staccato was at the time unequaled, as was his orchestral sonority. According to his student Nadia Reisenberg, he continuously used a combination of finger pedalling and foot pedalling. The New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg said Hofmann had all of Leopold Godowsky's technique, a claim approved by Godowsky himself.Abram Chasins. Speaking of Pianists. Random House. 1957 By his own admission, Sergei Rachmaninoff, in his 40s, prepared for a career as a concert pianist by practicing over 15 hours a day with the goal of attaining the level of Hofmann's technique. When pianist Ralph Berkowitz was asked if Vladimir Horowitz had the greatest technique of all the pianists he had heard, Berkowitz replied that Horowitz indeed was the supreme master of the technical parts of performance, but one older era pianist was his equal - Hofmann. Hofmann's approach and style can be summarized by his motto \\"an aristocrat never hurries\\". He often stated that Rubinstein and Moriz Rosenthal were the only pianists that influenced his art, and admired singers Mattia Battistini and Marcella Sembrich. He adopted a more demonstrative style in live performances but a subtle and restrained style for his studio recordings; in both cases, he mostly adhered to the printed score, occasionally doubling left-hand octaves, and shunned sentimentality. He put spontaneity rather than structure foremost and admitted to Rachmaninoff that \\"I do not know how to build a composition ... occasionally, it happens to sound well\\". Schonberg wrote that among Hofmann's contemporaries, only Godowsky had the finish and refinement of Hofmann but lacked Hofmann's color, fire, and \\"red blood\\", while only Ferruccio Busoni and Rachmaninoff were ever mentioned by contemporaries as Hofmann's equals. After hearing a performance of Chopin's B minor Sonata by Hofmann, Rachmaninoff cut that piece from his own repertoire saying \\"not since Anton Rubinstein have I heard such titanic playing\\". Suggested examples illustrating Hofmann's style: * Rubinstein's Contradanses * Chopin's Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise Op.22 * Chopin's Ballade Op.23 * 2nd Movement from Beethoven's Sonata Op.31 No.3 * Rachmanionoff's Prelude Op.23 No.5 * Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No.2 * Stojowski's Caprice Orientale (dedicated to him by Sigismond Stojowski). Repertoire, musical ear and memory Hofmann's repertoire was mostly confined to music written before the start of the 20th century. Much like Rubinstein's seven historic recitals of 1885, he gave 21 consecutive concerts in St. Petersburg without repeating a single piece, playing 255 different works from memory during that marathon cycle in 1912‚Äì1913.Schonberg, 385 In the diary his wife kept during his 1909 Russian tour, she mentions his raising his eyebrows when he saw Brahms' Handel Variations on a program‚Äîa piece he had not played or even looked at for two and a half years. He played the work at the concert without hesitation. Although a poor sight reader, he was said to possess the ability of Franz Liszt and Camille Saint-Sa√´ns to hear a composition once and play it back correctly without seeing the printed notes. Rosina Lh√©vinne recalled that Hofmann heard her husband Josef Lh√©vinne play Liszt's Lorelei, a piece Hofmann had never heard but went on to play it \\"just like my Josef (Lhevinne)\\" for an encore at his concert later that day.Schonberg, 386-387 Maurice Aronson, who served as Leopold Godowsky's assistant, recalled Hofmann learning Godowsky's Fledermaus transcription. Godowsky and Hofmann met in Berlin in 1900, becoming friends until Godowsky's death in 1938. Hofmann would visit Godowsky's studio and listen while Godowsky was composing Fledermaus. A week later Hofmann visited Godowsky again and played the entire transcription, and he had never seen the music. Godowsky, in fact, had not yet written it down. Schonberg has added that Godowsky's Fledermaus is one of the most resourceful and complicated stunts ever written for the piano. Recordings Hofmann started recording in studios in the 1880s but was never satisfied with the available technology and made only test pressings after 1923; he considered the test pressings made for HMV in November 1935 to be a worthwhile representation of his art. In the 1940s he recorded for the Bell Telephone Hour radio programs of which some rare footage remains, including Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2, and Beethoven's Concerto in E-flat major, \\"Emperor\\". Gregor Benko has remarked that Hofmann should not have appeared on many of the Bell Telephone Hour broadcasts since, by this time, his pianistic control had deteriorated considerably though the tonal palette was still immense and the phrasing provocative (see and ). Hofmann's student Jeanne Behrend, after first hearing the recordings from 1940 to 1946, stated \\"well, it's his playing, but nothing like what we heard in the 1920s.\\" Cylinders recorded c. 1890 for Thomas Edison were some of the earliest recordings of classical music and were lost during World War I. Four cylinders made in Russia in 1895‚Äì1896, with music by Mendelssohn, Louis Brassin and Rubinstein, have been recently discovered and issued on CD. He made two series of reproducing piano rolls, including in 1913 23 pieces for Welte-Mignon but did not trust rolls as an accurate representation of his playing. Hofmann recorded acoustic discs from 1912 to 1923 for Columbia and Brunswick, but felt the representation of his chaste and prismatic tonal palette was not captured. Hofmann experimented with short studio test recordings for RCA Victor in 1935 (which were released on LP by RCA in 1970), and in retirement in California experimented with piano string electrical pickups and designing an additional spruce soundboard under the piano lid. RCA Victor privately recorded the 50th anniversary concert of Hofmann's New York debut at the Metropolitan Opera House on November 28, 1937. At least two of his other concerts in 1930's were recorded live. These concert recordings exhibit an older Hofmann (age 60-62) in public just prior to the sharp decline in his pianistic command, and include sensational readings of Chopin's G minor Ballade, Andante Spianato and Grand Polonaise, A-flat Waltz (Op. 42) and F minor Ballade. All of these recordings have been published on compact discs under the auspices of Gregor Benko and audio restoration specialist Ward Marston. Stature The 1917 New York Times article of James Huneker placing contemporary pianists, including Hofmann, in the context of the past legends. Harold C. Schonberg has argued that Hofmann was the most flawless and possibly the greatest pianist of the 20th century. HMV and RCA unsuccessfully pursued recording projects with Hofmann in the 1930s. Rachmaninoff dedicated his Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor (1909) to Hofmann, although Hofmann disliked it and never played it. Older generation critics such as James Huneker labeled Hofmann the \\"king of pianists\\", and Samuel Chotzinoff called him the \\"greatest pianist of our time.\\" Contemporaries such as Rachmaninoff, Ignaz Friedman, Josef Lh√©vinne, and Godowsky considered Hofmann to be, overall, the greatest pianist of their generation, but the acclaim was not so universal from the next generation of pianists. In his autobiography Arthur Rubinstein criticized Hofmann as someone who took interest in only the mechanics of music and not in its heart or spirituality, and commented that at the end of Hofmann's career \\"he was left with nothing after his technique left him\\".H. Sachs. Arthur Rubinstein: Biography and Memoirs. Phoenix, 1997 Claudio Arrau dismissed Hofmann (along with Paderewski) as someone who only happened to be very famous and said \\"I didn't know what to do with him\\".J. Horowitz. Arrau on Music and Performance. Courier Dover Publications, 1999 Sviatoslav Richter, after listening to a Hofmann RCA test pressing of the Scherzo from Beethoven's Sonata in E-flat, Op. 31, No. 3, considered the older pianist to be technically \\"stunning\\", but noted that Hofmann ignored the composer's sforzando markings; while Gy√∂rgy S√°ndor has called him the greatest of all 20th-century pianists in terms of music, interpretation, and technique.The Art of Piano: Great Pianists of the 20th Century. DVD released by Warner Music Vision, August 2002. Hofmann's own student Shura Cherkassky compared Horowitz favorably with Hofmann as follows: \\"Hofmann was possibly the greater musical mind. But, I think, Horowitz was the greater pianist, the greater virtuoso‚Äîhe somehow appealed to the whole world. Hofmann could not communicate on that level\\". To balance the record, Earl Wild acknowledged Hofmann‚Äôs style as the biggest influence on him gaining a fluid and flexible technique: ‚ÄòHis interpretations were always delivered with great logic and beauty.‚Äô Jorge Bolet is reported to have said that whenever he heard either Rachmaninoff or Hofmann, he always thought to himself, ‚ÄòEvery note that they play ‚Äì that is what I would like to play.‚Äô Bibliography Hofmann's books were based on his frequent articles in the Ladies' Home Journal: * Piano Playing: A Little Book of Simple Suggestions (1907) ‚Äî e-text * Piano Questions Answered (1909) * Piano Playing: With Piano Questions Answered (1920, compilation of the first two books) ‚Äî e-text, and References External links  * Josef Hofmann Collection at the International Piano Archives at Maryland (accessed 12 July 2013) * * Piano Rolls () * Jan ≈ªd≈ºarski: J√≥zef Hofmann Geniusz zapomniany, Wydawnictwo STO, www.sto.com.pl * Historical Marker Database Josef Hofmann Historical Marker, Aiken, SC * * Category:1876 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Musicians from Krak√≥w Category:People from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Polish Austro-Hungarians Category:Polish people of German descent Category:Polish emigrants to the United States Category:American people of Polish descent Category:American classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:American male pianists Category:20th-century American inventors Category:American male composers Category:American composers Category:Child classical musicians Category:Polish classical pianists Category:Polish composers Category:Polish inventors Category:Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) ","title":"Josef Hofmann"},{"id":"440260","text":"The English term enlightenment is the western translation of the abstract noun bodhi, (; Sanskrit: ‡§¨‡•ã‡§ß‡§ø; Pali: bodhi), the knowledge or wisdom, or awakened intellect, of a Buddha. The verbal root budh- means \\"to awaken,\\" and its literal meaning is closer to \\"awakening.\\" Although the term buddhi is also used in other Indian philosophies and traditions, its most common usage is in the context of Buddhism. The term \\"enlightenment\\" was popularised in the Western world through the 19th century translations of Max M√ºller. It has the western connotation of general insight into transcendental truth or reality. The term is also being used to translate several other Buddhist terms and concepts, which are used to denote (initial) insight (prajna (Sanskrit), wu (Chinese), kensho and satori (Japanese)); knowledge (vidhya); the \\"blowing out\\" (Nirvana) of disturbing emotions and desires and the subsequent freedom or release (vimukti); and the attainment of supreme Buddhahood (samyak sam bodhi), as exemplified by Gautama Buddha. What exactly constituted the Buddha's awakening is unknown. It may probably have involved the knowledge that liberation was attained by the combination of mindfulness and dhyƒÅna, applied to the understanding of the arising and ceasing of craving. The relation between dhyana and insight is a core problem in the study of Buddhism, and is one of the fundamentals of Buddhist practice. In the western world the concept of (spiritual) enlightenment has taken on a romantic meaning. It has become synonymous with self-realization and the true self and false self, being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning.

The feminine Sanskrit noun of *budh- is ‡§¨‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§ø, buddhi, \\"prescience, intuition, perception, point of view.\\" Translation Robert S. Cohen notes that the majority of English books on Buddhism use the term \\"enlightenment\\" to translate the term bodhi. The root budh, from which both bodhi and Buddha are derived, means \\"to wake up\\" or \\"to recover consciousness\\". Cohen notes that bodhi is not the result of an illumination, but of a path of realization, or coming to understanding. The term \\"enlightenment\\" is event-oriented, whereas the term \\"awakening\\" is process- oriented. The western use of the term \\"enlighten\\" has Christian roots, as in Calvin's \\"It is God alone who enlightens our minds to perceive his truths\\". Early 19th century bodhi was translated as \\"intelligence\\". The term \\"enlighten\\" was first being used in 1835, in an English translation of a French article, while the first recorded use of the term 'enlightenment' is credited (by the Oxford English Dictionary) to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (February, 1836). In 1857 The Times used the term \\"the Enlightened\\" for the Buddha in a short article, which was reprinted the following year by Max M√ºller. Thereafter, the use of the term subsided, but reappeared with the publication of Max M√ºller's Chips from a german Workshop, which included a reprint from the Times-article. The book was translated in 1969 into German, using the term \\"der Erleuchtete\\". Max M√ºller was an essentialist, who believed in a natural religion, and saw religion as an inherent capacity of human beings. \\"Enlightenment\\" was a means to capture natural religious truths, as distinguished from mere mythology. By the mid-1870s it had become commonplace to call the Buddha \\"enlightened\\", and by the end of the 1880s the terms \\"enlightened\\" and \\"enlightenment\\" dominated the English literature. Related terms=InsightBodhi= Bodhi (Sanskrit, PƒÅli), from the verbal root budd, \\"to awaken\\", \\"to understand\\", means literally \\"to have woken up and understood\\". According to Johannes Bronkhorst, Tillman Vetter, and K.R. Norman, bodhi was at first not specified. K.R. Norman: According to Norman, bodhi may basically have meant the knowledge that nibbana was attained, due to the practice of dhyana. Originally only \\"prajna\\" may have been mentioned, and Tillman Vetter even concludes that originally dhyana itself was deemed liberating, with the stilling of pleasure or pain in the fourth jhana, not the gaining of some perfect wisdom or insight. Gombrich also argues that the emphasis on insight is a later development. In Theravada Buddhism, bodhi refers to the realisation of the four stages of enlightenment and becoming an Arahant. In Theravada Buddhism, bodhi is equal to supreme insight, and the realisation of the four noble truths, which leads to deliverance. According to Nyanatiloka, This equation of bodhi with the four noble truths is a later development, in response to developments within Indian religious thought, where \\"liberating insight\\" was deemed essential for liberation. The four noble truths as the liberating insight of the Buddha eventually were superseded by Pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda, the twelvefold chain of causation, and still later by anatta, the emptiness of the self. In Mahayana Buddhism, bodhi is equal to prajna, insight into the Buddha- nature, sunyata and tathatƒÅ. This is equal to the realisation of the non- duality of absolute and relative. =Prajna= In Theravada Buddhism pannƒÅ (Pali) means \\"understanding\\", \\"wisdom\\", \\"insight\\". \\"Insight\\" is equivalent to vipassana', insight into the three marks of existence, namely anicca, dukkha and anatta. Insight leads to the four stages of enlightenment and Nirvana. In Mahayana Buddhism Prajna (Sanskrit) means \\"insight\\" or \\"wisdom\\", and entails insight into sunyata. The attainment of this insight is often seen as the attainment of \\"enlightenment\\". =Wu= wu is the Chinese term for initial insight. =Kensho and satori= Kensho and Satori are Japanese terms used in Zen traditions. Kensho means \\"seeing into one's true nature.\\" Ken means \\"seeing\\", sho means \\"nature\\", \\"essence\\", c.q Buddha-nature. Satori (Japanese) is often used interchangeably with kensho, but refers to the experience of kensho. The Rinzai tradition sees kensho as essential to the attainment of Buddhahood, but considers further practice essential to attain Buddhahood. East-Asian (Chinese) Buddhism emphasizes insight into Buddha-nature. This term is derived from Indian tathagata-garbha thought, \\"the womb of the thus-gone\\" (the Buddha), the inherent potential of every sentient being to become a Buddha. This idea was integrated with the Yogacara-idea of the ƒÅlaya vij√±ƒÅna, and further developed in Chinese Buddhism, which integrated Indian Buddhism with native Chinese thought. Buddha-nature came to mean both the potential of awakening and the whole of reality, a dynamic interpenetration of absolute and relative. In this awakening it is realized that observer and observed are not distinct entities, but mutually co-dependent. Knowledge The term vidhya is being used in contrast to avidhya, ignorance or the lack of knowledge, which binds us to samsara. The Mahasaccaka Sutta describes the three knowledges which the Buddha attained: # Insight into his past lives # Insight into the workings of Karma and Reincarnation # Insight into the Four Noble Truths According to Bronkhorst, the first two knowledges are later additions, while insight into the four truths represents a later development, in response to concurring religious traditions, in which \\"liberating insight\\" came to be stressed over the practice of dhyana. Freedom Vimukthi, also called moksha, means \\"freedom\\", \\"release\\", \\"deliverance\\". Sometimes a distinction is being made between ceto-vimukthi, \\"liberation of the mind\\", and panna- vimukthi, \\"liberation by understanding\\". The Buddhist tradition recognises two kinds of ceto-vimukthi, one temporarily and one permanent, the last being equivalent to panna-vimukthi. Yogacara uses the term ƒÅ≈õraya parƒÅv≈ótti, \\"revolution of the basis\\", Nirvana Nirvana is the \\"blowing out\\" of disturbing emotions, which is the same as liberation.Dr. Alexander Berzin, Nirvana and enlightenment The usage of the term \\"enlightenment\\" to translate \\"nirvana\\" was popularized in the 19th century, due, in part, to the efforts of Max Muller, who used the term consistently in his translations. Buddha's awakening=Buddhahood Three types of buddha are recognized: * Arhat (Pali: arahant), those who reach Nirvana by following the teachings of the Buddha. Sometimes the term ≈örƒÅvakabuddha (Pali: sƒÅvakabuddha) is used to designate this kind of awakened person; * Pratyekabuddhas (Pali: paccekabuddha), those who reach Nirvana through self-realisation, without the aid of spiritual guides and teachers, but don't teach the Dharma; * Samyaksambuddha (Pali: samma sambuddha), often simply referred to as Buddha, one who has reached Nirvana by his own efforts and wisdom and teaches it skillfully to others. Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha, is said to have achieved full awakening, known as samyaksa·πÉbodhi (Sanskrit; PƒÅli: sammƒÅsa·πÉbodhi), \\"perfect Buddhahood\\", or anuttarƒÅ-samyak-sa·πÉbodhi, \\"highest perfect awakening\\". Specifically, anuttarƒÅ-samyak-sa·πÉbodhi, literally meaning unsurpassed, complete and perfect enlightenment, is often used to distinguish the enlightenment of a Buddha from that of an Arhat. The term Buddha has acquired somewhat different meanings in the various Buddhist traditions. An equivalent term for Buddha is TathƒÅgata, \\"the thus-gone\\". The way to Buddhahood is somewhat differently understood in the various Buddhist traditions. The awakening of the BuddhaCanonical accounts= In the suttapitaka, the Buddhist canon as preserved in the Theravada tradition, a couple of texts can be found in which the Buddha's attainment of liberation forms part of the narrative. The Ariyapariyesana Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 26) describes how the Buddha was dissatisfied with the teachings of Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta, wandered further through Magadhan country, and then found \\"an agreeable piece of ground\\" which served for striving. The sutra then only says that he attained Nibbana. In the Vanapattha Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 17) the Buddha describes life in the jungle, and the attainment of awakening. The Mahasaccaka Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 36) describes his ascetic practices, which he abandoned. There-after he remembered a spontaneous state of jhana, and set out for jhana-practice. Both suttras narrate how, after destroying the disturbances of the mind, and attaining concentration of the mind, he attained three knowledges (vidhya): # Insight into his past lives # Insight into the workings of Karma and Reincarnation # Insight into the Four Noble Truths Insight into the Four Noble Truths is here called awakening. The monk (bhikkhu) has \\"...attained the unattained supreme security from bondage.\\" Awakening is also described as synonymous with Nirvana, the extinction of the passions whereby suffering is ended and no more rebirths take place. The insight arises that this liberation is certain: \\"Knowledge arose in me, and insight: my freedom is certain, this is my last birth, now there is no rebirth.\\" =Critical assessment= Schmithausen notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting \\"liberating insight\\", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36. Bronkhorst notices that It calls in question the reliability of these accounts, and the relation between dhyana and insight, which is a core problem in the study of early Buddhism. Originally the term prajna may have been used, which came to be replaced by the four truths in those texts where \\"liberating insight\\" was preceded by the four jhanas. Bronkhorst also notices that the conception of what exactly this \\"liberating insight\\" was developed throughout time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified, later on the four truths served as such, to be superseded by pratityasamutpada, and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person. And Schmithausen notices that still other descriptions of this \\"liberating insight\\" exist in the Buddhist canon: An example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42‚Äì43, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha. Understanding of bodhi and Buddhahood The term bodhi acquired a variety of meanings and connotations during the development of Buddhist thoughts in the various schools. Early Buddhism In early Buddhism, bodhi carried a meaning synonymous to nirvana, using only some different metaphors to describe the insight, which implied the extinction of lobha (greed), dosa (hate) and moha (delusion). Theravada In Theravada Buddhism, bodhi and nirvana carry the same meaning, that of being freed from greed, hate and delusion. In Theravada Buddhism, bodhi refers to the realisation of the four stages of enlightenment and becoming an Arahant. In Theravada Buddhism, bodhi is equal to supreme insight, the realisation of the four noble truths, which leads to deliverance. Reaching full awakening is equivalent in meaning to reaching NirvƒÅ·πáa. Attaining NirvƒÅ·πáa is the ultimate goal of Theravada and other ≈õrƒÅvaka traditions. It involves the abandonment of the ten fetters and the cessation of dukkha or suffering. Full awakening is reached in four stages. According to Nyanatiloka, Since the 1980s, western Theravada-oriented teachers have started to question the primacy of insight. According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, jhana and vipassana (insight) form an integrated practice. Polak and Arbel, following scholars like Vetter and Bronkhorst, argue that right effort, c.q. the four right efforts (sense restraint, preventing the arising of unwholesome states, and the generation of wholesome states), mindfulness, and dhyana form an integrated practice, in which dhyana is the actualisation of insight, leading to an awakened awareness which is \\"non-reactive and lucid.\\" Mahayana In Mahayana-thought, bodhi is the realisation of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, and the unity of subject and object. It is similar to prajna, to realizing the Buddha-nature, realizing sunyata and realizing suchness. In time, the Buddha's awakening came to be understood as an immediate full awakening and liberation, instead of the insight into and certainty about the way to follow to reach enlightenment. However, in some Zen traditions this perfection came to be relativized again; according to one contemporary Zen master, \\"Shakyamuni buddha and Bodhidharma are still practicing.\\" Mahayana discerns three forms of awakened beings: # Arahat ‚Äì Liberation for oneself; # Bodhisattva ‚Äì Liberation for living beings; # Full Buddhahood. Within the various Mahayana-schools exist various further explanations and interpretations. In MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism the Bodhisattva is the ideal. The ultimate goal is not only of one's own liberation in Buddhahood, but the liberation of all living beings. But Mahayana Buddhism also developed a cosmology with a wide range of buddhas and bodhisattvas, who assist humans on their way to liberation. Nichiren Buddhism regards Buddhahood as a state of perfect freedom, in which one is awakened to the eternal and ultimate truth that is the reality of all things. This supreme state of life is characterized by boundless wisdom and infinite compassion. The Lotus Sutra reveals that Buddhahood is a potential in the lives of all beings. =Buddha-nature= In the Tathagatagarbha and Buddha-nature doctrines bodhi becomes equivalent to the universal, natural and pure state of the mind: According to these doctrines bodhi is always there within one's mind, but requires the defilements to be removed. This vision is expounded in texts such as the Shurangama Sutra and the Uttaratantra. In Shingon Buddhism, the state of Bodhi is also seen as naturally inherent in the mind. It is the mind's natural and pure state, where no distinction is being made between a perceiving subject and perceived objects. This is also the understanding of Bodhi found in Yogacara Buddhism. To achieve this vision of non-duality, it is necessary to recognise one's own mind: =Harmonisation of the various terms and meanings in Vajrayana Buddhism= During the development of Mahayana Buddhism the various strands of thought on Bodhi were continuously being elaborated. Attempts were made to harmonize the various terms. The Vajrayana Buddhist commentator Buddhaguhya treats various terms as synonyms: Western understanding of enlightenment In the western world the concept of enlightenment has taken on a romantic meaning. It has become synonymous with self-realization and the true self, being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning. Enlightenment as \\"Aufkl√§rung\\" The use of the western word enlightenment is based on the supposed resemblance of bodhi with Aufkl√§rung, the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world. In fact there are more resemblances with Romanticism than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances. Awakening The equivalent term \\"awakening\\" has also been used in a Christian context, namely the Great Awakenings, several periods of religious revival in American religious history. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these \\"Great Awakenings\\" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations. Romanticism and transcendentalism The romantic idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized especially by D.T. Suzuki. Further popularization was due to the writings of Heinrich Dumoulin. Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the expression of a transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes anatta. This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of Ken Wilber. In the oldest Buddhism this essentialism is not recognizable.Nanzan Institute: Pruning the bodhi Tree According to critics it doesn't really contribute to a real insight into Buddhism:David Chapman: Effing the ineffable > ...most of them labour under the old clich√© that the goal of Buddhist > psychological analysis is to reveal the hidden mysteries in the human mind > and thereby facilitate the development of a transcendental state of > consciousness beyond the reach of linguistic expression. Enlightenment and experience A common reference in western culture is the notion of \\"enlightenment experience\\". This notion can be traced back to William James, who used the term \\"religious experience\\" in his 1902 book, The Varieties of Religious Experience. Wayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of \\"religious experience\\" further back to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768‚Äì1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. Schleiermacher used the notion of \\"religious experience\\" to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was popularised by the Transcendentalists, and exported to Asia via missionaries. Transcendentalism developed as a reaction against 18th Century rationalism, John Locke's philosophy of Sensualism, and the predestination of New England Calvinism. It is fundamentally a variety of diverse sources such as Hindu texts like the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, various religions, and German idealism. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential. The notion of \\"experience\\" has been criticised. Robert Sharf points out that \\"experience\\" is a typical western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences. The notion of \\"experience\\" introduces a false notion of duality between \\"experiencer\\" and \\"experienced\\", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the \\"non-duality\\" of observer and observed. \\"Pure experience\\" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity. The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what \\"experience\\" someone has, which means that this \\"experience\\" is not the proof of the teaching, but a result of the teaching. A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by \\"cleaning the doors of perception\\" as per romantic poet William Blake, would, according to Mohr, be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence. Bodhi Day Sakyamuni's awakening is celebrated on Bodhi Day. In Sri Lanka and Japan different days are used for this celebration. According to the Theravada tradition in Sri Lanka, Sakyamuni reached Buddhahood at the full moon in May. This is celebrated at Wesak Poya, the full moon in May, as Sambuddhatva jayanthi (also known as Sambuddha jayanthi).Vesak full moon poya day The Zen tradition claims the Buddha reached his decisive insight on 8 December. This is celebrated in Zen monasteries with a very intensive eight-day session of R≈çhatsu.

It has over 1.3 million members, including NAR's institutes, societies, and councils, involved in all aspects of the residential and commercial real estate industries. NAR also functions as a self-regulatory organization for real estate brokerage. The organization is headquartered in Chicago. Overview National Association of Realtors building on New Jersey Ave, NW, Washington DC The National Association of Realtors was founded on May 13, 1908 as the National Association of Real Estate Exchanges in Chicago, Illinois. In 1916, the National Association of Real Estate Exchanges changed its name to The National Association of Real Estate Boards. The current name was adopted in 1972. NAR's members are residential and commercial real estate brokers, real estate salespeople, immovable property managers, appraisers, counselors, and others engaged in all aspects of the real estate (immovable property) industry, where a state license to practice is required. Members belong to one or more of some 1,600 local realtor boards or associations. They are pledged to a code of ethics and standards of practice, which were adopted in 1913. The National Association of Realtors is also a member of The Real Estate Roundtable, a lobbying group in Washington, D.C. Trademark  The use of the term \\"realtor\\" was first proposed by Charles N. Chadbourn, in an article in the National Real Estate Journal in March 1916. Accessed April 3, 2015. Chadbourn, then a real estate agent in Minneapolis and vice-president of the National Association of Real Estate Boards, wrote \\"I propose that the National Association adopt a professional title to be conferred upon its members which they shall use to distinguish them from outsiders. That this title be copyrighted and defended by the National Association against misuse... I therefore, propose that the National Association adopt and confer upon its members, dealers in realty, the title of realtor (accented on the first syllable).\\" The association adopted the term the following year, at its national convention in New Orleans in April 1916.

The 515,200 and 519,789 registrations have been subject to a number of cancellation proceedings: *In June 1998, Arleen Freeman, a real estate agent who had formerly been an NAR member, petitioned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to cancel both registrations.Arleen Freeman v.

On March 30, 2016, the TTAB granted the NAR's motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that Schermerhorn, who had been a NAR member and licensee at the time he submitted his petition to cancel, was also estopped from challenging the mark. NAR and Multiple Listing Service (MLS) systems The NAR governs the hundreds of local Multiple Listing Services (MLSs) which are the information exchanges used across the nation by real estate brokers. (However, there are many MLSs that are independent of NAR, although membership is typically limited to licensed brokers and their agents; MLSPIN is an example of one of the larger independent MLSs in North America.) Through a complicated arrangement, NAR sets the policies for most of the Multiple Listings Services, and in the late 1990s, with the growth of the Internet, NAR evolved regulations allowing Internet Data Exchanges (IDX) whereby brokers would allow a portion of their data to be seen on the Internet via brokers' or agents' websites and Virtual Office Websites (VOW) which required potential buyers to register to obtain information. These policies allowed participants‚Äîwhether they were individual one-person brokers or large regional companies‚Äîto limit access to some or all of the MLS data by individual brokers (whether they were brokers operating solely on the Internet or local competitors). In 2005, this prompted the Department of Justice to file an antitrust lawsuit against NAR alleging its MLS rules in regard to these types of limitations on the display of data were the product of a conspiracy to restrain trade by excluding brokers who used the Internet to operate differently from traditional brick-and-mortar brokers. (For a description of the DOJ action, see Antitrust Case filings for US v. National Association of Realtors.United States v. National Association of Realtors. United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. 2008-05-27. Retrieved 2008-05-27.) Meanwhile, various real estate trends such as expanded consumer access and the Internet are consolidating existing local MLS organizations into larger and more statewide or regional MLS systems, such as in California and Virginia/Maryland/Washington DC's Metropolitan Regional Information Systems. In response to the case, NAR had proposed setting up a single Internet Listing Display system which would not allow participants to exclude individual brokers (whether of a bricks-and-mortar type or solely internet-based) but require a blanket opting out of display on all other brokers sites. This system became the IDX system. Although IDX allows the public to view MLS listings, it still requires the listing brokerage information to be placed on the listing every place it appears (brokers legally \\"own\\" the listings of their brokerage), to prevent misrepresentation of the listing information, and to place accountability for the information on the broker as the law dictates. The antitrust lawsuit was settled in May 2008.Bartz, Diane. Realtors to open listings to settle lawsuit. Reuters. 2008-05-27. Retrieved 2008-05-27. The agreement mandates that all Multiple Listing Service systems allow access to Internet-based competitors.Jordan, Lara Jakes. Settlement opens listings to online real estate agents. Associated Press. The Mercury News, Silicon Valley. 2008-05-27. Retrieved 2008-05-27. The NAR will be required to treat online brokers the same as traditional brokers and cannot exclude them from membership because they do not have a traditional business model.Lichtblau, Eric. Realtors Agree to Stop Blocking Web Listings. The New York Times. 2008-05-28. Retrieved 2008-05-27. The NAR admitted no wrongdoing, and it paid neither fines nor damages as part of the deal. The settlement will not be official until a federal judge formally approves it, most likely in 2008. While the general counsel of the NAR believes that the settlement will have no effect on the commission paid by the general public, a business professor at Western Michigan University predicted that the increased competition would cause a 25 to 50 percent decrease in commissions. Another major anticompetitive practice is supported (indirectly) by various state laws which prohibit the \\"sharing\\" of commissions with unlicensed individuals. In broad interpretations, this is deemed to prevent a buyers' agent from providing a credit to his or her buyers from commissions received. Currently, there are 10 states where real estate agents and brokers are barred from offering homebuyers or sellers cash rebates or gifts of any kind with a cash value more than $25. Various realtors in such states have successfully contested this interpretation in states which now allow the practice (notably, Patrick Lea, a realtor in Ohio, and numerous agents in Kentucky). The Kentucky case was ultimately tried with the United States Department of Justice as the plaintiff and the Kentucky Real Estate Commission as the defendant. In 2019, The National Association of Realtors‚Äô board approved the Clear Cooperation Policy. A policy that requires brokers to submit a listing to the Multiple Listings Service within one business day of marketing a property to the public. Lobbying The NAR wields substantial power as a lobbying organization. Since 1999, the NAR has spent more than $99,384,108, and spent $22,355,463 in 2011 alone. It has consistently ranked among the largest Political Action Committees in the United States. In its 2016 figures, the Center for Responsive Politics ranked the National Association of Realtors as the 2nd largest top spender in lobbying after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The NAR spent $64,821,111 in 2016. On the total spending, the largest share‚Äî46%‚Äîhas gone to Republicans, and 30.8% has gone to Democrats. Key political issues for the group revolve around federal de-regulation of the financial services industry. Enabling the subprime mortgage crisis U.S. Median Price of Homes Sold Some experts believe that brokers and realtors bear at least partial responsibility for the subprime mortgage crisis, purposefully inflating the perceived market values of homes, and subsequently encouraging buyers to take out larger mortgages than needed. The theory is that collusion with mortgage lenders enabled realtors to earn high volumes of commission on borrowed money for inflated house values with no risk to the realtors. Many victims feel that home buyers were tricked into taking out larger loans to buy more expensive homes, and the higher sales prices paid the realtors higher commissions. This practice is not considered \\"unethical\\" by the NAR which claims to be a Self-regulatory organization; however, obvious implications show extensive and substantial harm rendered to the public. Many victims are encouraging the Securities and Exchange Commission to begin aggressively regulating agents and refunding overpayments to homebuyers. Antitrust lawsuits In 2005, the United States Department of Justice filed a formal complaint against the National Association of Realtors for violating Section 4 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The complaint sought to enjoin the National Association of Realtors \\"from maintaining or enforcing a policy that restrains competition from brokers who use the Internet to more efficiently and cost effectively serve home sellers and buyers, and from adopting other related anticompetitive rules. The DOJ challenged NAR's MLS rules that inhibited competition from Internet-based brokers. On November 18, 2008 the Court entered a Final Judgment approving a settlement against NAR. Under the Final Judgment, the NAR agreed to the policies challenged by the United States and replaced those policies with rules that do not discriminate against brokers who use the Internet to provide low-priced brokerage services to consumers. In 2012, American Home Realty Network, Inc. the operator of NeighborCity filed antitrust counterclaims in response to a pair of copyright lawsuits, alleging that the \\"copyright lawsuits filed against it by two multiple listing services with financial backing from the National Association of Realtors are part of a concerted effort by NAR to drive the company out of business and eliminate it as a provider of services to real estate brokers.\\" The counter-claims also allege that the copyrights asserted were never properly registered. In the Minnesota case, which recites claims against the NAR but does not directly name the NAR as a counter-defendant, AHRN filed a second amended counterclaim adding Edina Realty and Home Services of America as Counter-Defendants in the antitrust and unfair competition claims. Edina Realty is a subsidiary of HomeServices of America, Inc., a Berkshire Hathaway company, which owns real estate brokerage firms in states across the country, including Minnesota, Maryland, North Carolina, Georgia, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Illinois, Kansas, South Carolina, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Kentucky, Alabama, and California. Earlier in 2012, the mid-Atlantic multiple listing service Metropolitan Regional Information Systems, Inc. (MRIS) and St. Paul, MN-based Regional Multiple Listing Service of Minnesota Inc. (NorthstarMLS) filed copyright claims against NeighborCity. The National Association of Realtors said it would provide financial support for NorthstarMLS and MRIS legal expenses.

Her works include Poems of Passion and Solitude, which contains the lines \\"Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone.\\" Her autobiography, The Worlds and I, was published in 1918, a year before her death. Biography Ella Wheeler was born in 1850 on a farm in Johnstown, Wisconsin, east of Janesville, the youngest of four children. The family later moved north of Madison, after losing its wealth, as the result of her father's failed business aspirations and speculation. Wilcox's family held themselves to be intellectuals, and a mastery of the nuances of the English language was prized. During her childhood, Wilcox amused herself by reading books and newspapers, which may have influenced her later writing (most notably William Shakespeare, The Arabian Nights, The Diverting History of John Gilpin and Gulliver's Travels, in addition to the few other pieces of literature that were to be had in her home). Around the age of 8, Wilcox turned to writing poetry as an outlet. When she was 13 years old, her first poem was published. After losing her subscription to The New York Mercury, and being unable to afford to resubscribe, Wilcox thought that if she could get a piece of literature published, she would at least receive a copy of the paper wherein her piece was printed. The piece that she submitted is lost, and Wilcox later admitted that she could not recall even the topic of the poem. Wilcox became known as a poet in her own state by the time she graduated from high school. Her poem \\"The Way of the World\\" was first published in the February 25, 1883 issue of The New York Sun. The inspiration for the poem came as she was travelling to attend the Governor's inaugural ball in Madison, Wisconsin. On her way to the celebration, there was a young woman dressed in black sitting across the aisle from her. The woman was crying. Miss Wheeler sat next to her and sought to comfort her for the rest of the journey. When they arrived, the poet was so depressed that she could barely attend the scheduled festivities. As she looked at her own radiant face in the mirror, she suddenly recalled the sorrowful widow. It was at that moment that she wrote the opening lines of \\"Solitude\\": :Laugh, and the world laughs with you; :Weep, and you weep alone. :For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth :But has trouble enough of its own She sent the poem to the Sun and received $5 for her effort. It was collected in the book Poems of Passion shortly afterward in May 1883. In 1884, she married Robert Wilcox of Meriden, Connecticut,E W Wilcox at Wikisource where the couple lived before moving to New York City and then to Granite Bay in the Short Beach section of Branford, Connecticut. The two homes they built on Long Island Sound, along with several cottages, became known as Bungalow Court, and they would hold gatherings there of literary and artistic friends.\\"A Celebration of Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Poet, Journalist, and Progressive Thinker,\\" Branford Historical Society They had one child, a son, who died shortly after birth. Not long after their marriage, they both became interested in theosophy, new thought, and spiritualism. Early in their married life, Robert and Ella Wheeler Wilcox promised each other that whoever died first would return and communicate with the other. Robert Wilcox died in 1916, after over thirty years of marriage. She was overcome with grief, which became ever more intense as week after week went without any message from him. It was at this time that she went to California to see the Rosicrucian astrologer, Max Heindel, still seeking help in her sorrow, still unable to understand why she had no word from her Robert. She wrote of this meeting: Several months later she composed a little mantra or affirmative prayer which she said over and over \\"I am the living witness: The dead live: And they speak through us and to us: And I am the voice that gives this glorious truth to the suffering world: I am ready, God: I am ready, Christ: I am ready, Robert.\\" Ella Wheeler Wilcox Wilcox made efforts to teach occult things to the world. Her works, filled with positive thinking, were popular in the New Thought Movement and by 1915 her booklet, What I Know About New Thought had a distribution of 50,000 copies, according to its publisher, Elizabeth Towne. The following statement expresses Wilcox's unique blending of New Thought, Spiritualism, and a Theosophical belief in reincarnation: \\"As we think, act, and live here today, we build the structures of our homes in spirit realms after we leave earth, and we build karma for future lives, thousands of years to come, on this earth or other planets. Life will assume new dignity, and labor new interest for us, when we come to the knowledge that death is but a continuation of life and labor, in higher planes.\\" Her final words in her autobiography The Worlds and I: \\"From this mighty storehouse (of God, and the hierarchies of Spiritual Beings) we may gather wisdom and knowledge, and receive light and power, as we pass through this preparatory room of earth, which is only one of the innumerable mansions in our Father's house. Think on these things.\\" Wilcox was an advocate of animal rights and vegetarianism.\\"Be Kind to Animals\\". Los Angeles Herald, Volume XL, Number 94, 19 February 1914. She died of cancer on October 30, 1919 in Short Beach, Connecticut. Poetry A popular poet rather than a literary poet, in her poems she expresses sentiments of cheer and optimism in plainly written, rhyming verse. Her world view is expressed in the title of her poem \\"Whatever Is‚ÄîIs Best\\", suggesting an echo of Alexander Pope's \\"Whatever is, is right,\\" a concept formally articulated by Gottfried Leibniz and parodied by Voltaire's character Doctor Pangloss in Candide. Ella's poem plaque at San Francisco's Jack Kerouac Alley. None of Wilcox's works were included by F. O. Matthiessen in The Oxford Book of American Verse, but Hazel Felleman chose fourteen of her poems for Best Loved Poems of the American People, while Martin Gardner selected \\"The Way Of The World\\" and \\"The Winds of Fate\\" for Best Remembered Poems. She is frequently cited in anthologies of bad poetry, such as The Stuffed Owl: An Anthology of Bad Verse and Very Bad Poetry. Sinclair Lewis indicates Babbitt's lack of literary sophistication by having him refer to a piece of verse as \\"one of the classic poems, like 'If‚Äî' by Kipling, or Ella Wheeler Wilcox's 'The Man Worth While.'\\" The latter opens: :It is easy enough to be pleasant, : When life flows by like a song, :But the man worth while is one who will smile, : When everything goes dead wrong. Her poem \\"Solitude\\" opens: :Laugh and the world laughs with you, : Weep, and you weep alone; :The good old earth must borrow its mirth,Some versions indicate the words are \\"For the brave old earth must borrow its mirth\\" or \\"For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth\\" : But has trouble enough of its own. The Winds of Fate :One ship drives east and another drives west : With the selfsame winds that blow. : 'Tis the set of the sails, : And Not the gales, : That tell us the way to go. :Like the winds of the sea are the ways of fate; : As we voyage along through life, : 'Tis the set of a soul : That decides its goal, : And not the calm or the strife. Wheeler Wilcox cared about alleviating animal suffering, as can be seen from her poem, \\"Voice of the Voiceless\\". It begins as follows:Beers, D. 2006. For the Prevention of Cruelty: The History and Legacy of Animal Rights Activism in the United States. :So many gods, so many creeds, :So many paths that wind and wind, :While just the art of being kind :Is all the sad world needs. :I am the voice of the voiceless; :Through me the dumb shall speak, :Till the deaf world‚Äôs ear be made to hear :The wrongs of the wordless weak. :From street, from cage, and from kennel, :From stable and zoo, the wail :Of my tortured kin proclaims the sin :Of the mighty against the frail. She made an appearance during World War I in France, reciting her poem, The Stevedores (\\"Here's to the Army stevedores, lusty virile and strong...\\") while visiting a camp of 9,000 US Army stevedores. Titles for the ten episodes of the final, fifth season of Orphan Black come from Wilcox's poem, Protest.

While a broker may work independently, an agent usually works under a licensed broker to represent clients. Brokers and agents are licensed by the state to negotiate sales agreements and manage the documentation required for closing real estate transactions. Buyers and sellers are generally advised to consult a licensed real estate professional for a written definition of an individual state's laws of agency, and many states require written disclosures to be signed by all parties outlining the duties and obligations. Generally, real estate brokers/ agents fall into four categories of representation: *Seller's agents, commonly called \\"listing brokers\\" or \\"listing agents\\", are contracted by owners to assist with marketing property for sale or lease. *Buyer's agents are brokers or salespersons who assist buyers by helping them purchase property. *Dual agents help both the buyer and the seller in the same transaction. To protect their license to practice, a real estate broker owes both parties fair and honest dealing and must request that both parties (seller and buyer) sign a dual agency agreement. Special laws/rules often apply to dual agents, especially in negotiating price. In dual agency situations, a conflict of interest is more likely to occur, typically resulting in the loss of advocacy for both parties. Individual state laws vary and interpret dual agency rather differently, with some no longer allowing it. In some states, Dual Agency can be practiced in situations where the same brokerage (but not agent) represent both the buyer and the seller. If one agent from the brokerage has a home listed and another agent from that brokerage has a buyer-brokerage agreement with a buyer who wishes to buy the listed property, dual agency occurs by allowing each agent to be designated as an \\"intra-company\\" agent. Only the broker himself is the Dual Agent. *Transaction brokers provide the buyer and seller with a limited form of representation but without any fiduciary obligations. Having no more than a facilitator relationship, transaction brokers assist buyers, sellers, or both during the transaction without representing the interests of either party who may then be regarded as customers. The assistance provided are the legal documents for an agreement between the buyer and seller on how a particular transfer of property will happen. A real estate broker typically receives a real estate commission for successfully completing a sale. Across the U.S. this commission can generally range between 5-6% of the property's sale price for a full service broker but this percentage varies by state and even region. This commission can be divided up with other participating real estate brokers or agents. Flat-fee brokers and Fee-for-Service brokers can charge significantly less depending on the type of services offered. Licensing In the United States, real estate brokers and salespersons are licensed by each state, not by the federal government. Each state has a real estate ‚Äúcommission‚Äù who monitors and licenses real estate brokers and agents. For example, some states only allow for lawyers to create documentation to transfer real property, while other states also allow the licensed real estate agent. There are state laws defining the types of relationships that can exist between clients and real estate licensees, and the lawful duties of real estate licensees to represent clients and members of the public. Rules vary substantially as defined by the law from state to state, for example, on subjects that include what legal language is necessary to transfer real property, agency relationships, inspections, disclosures, continuing education, and other subjects. In most jurisdictions in the United States, a person must have a license to perform licensed activities, and these activities are defined within the statutes of each state. A main feature of the requirement for having a license to perform those activities is the work done \\"for compensation\\". Hence, hypothetically, if a person wants to help a friend out in either selling or buying a property, and no compensation of any kind is expected in return, then a license is not needed to perform all the work. However, since most people would expect to be compensated for their efforts and skills, a license would be required by law before a persons they may receive remuneration for services rendered as a real estate broker or agent. Unlicensed activity is illegal and the state real estate commission has authority to fine people who are acting as real estate licensee, but buyers and sellers acting as principals in the sale or purchase of real estate are usually not required to be licensed. It is important to note that in some states, lawyers handle real estate sales for compensation without being licensed as brokers or agents. However, even lawyers can only perform real estate activities which are incidental to their original work as a lawyer. It cannot be the case that a lawyer can become a seller's selling agent if that is all the service that is being requested by the client. Lawyers would still needed to be licensed as a broker if they wish to perform the licensed activities. Lawyers do however get a break in the minimum education requirements (for example, 90 hours in Illinois).  Specific States Representation Laws Some state Real Estate Commissions - notably Florida's after 1992 (and extended in 2003) and Colorado's after 1994 (with changes in 2003) created the option of having no agency or fiduciary relationship between brokers and sellers or buyers. As noted by the South Broward Board of Realtors, Inc. in a letter to State of Florida legislative committees: :\\"The Transaction Broker crafts a transaction by bringing a willing buyer and a willing seller together and provides the legal documentation of the details of the legal agreement between the same. The Transaction Broker is not a fiduciary of any party, but must abide by the law as well as professional and ethical standards.\\" (such as NAR Code of Ethics). The result was that in 2003, Florida created a system where the default brokerage relationship had \\"all licensees ... operating as transaction brokers, unless a single agent or no brokerage relationship is established, in writing, with the customer\\"The 2007 Florida Statutes. Chapter 475 Real Estate Brokers ‚Äî Part I; Real Estate Brokers, Sales Associates, and Schools (ss. 475.001-475.5018), Section 475.278 Authorized brokerage relationships; presumption of transaction brokerage; required disclosures (1) Brokerage Relationships: (a) Authorized brokerage relationships. ‚Äî A real estate licensee in this state may enter into a brokerage relationship as either a transaction broker or as a single agent with potential buyers and sellers. A real estate licensee may not operate as a disclosed or non-disclosed dual agent ... (b)Presumption of transaction brokerage. ‚Äî It shall be presumed that all licensees are operating as transaction brokers unless a single agent or no brokerage relationship is established, in writing, with a customer.\\" and the statute required written disclosure of the transaction brokerage relationship to the buyer or seller customer only through July 1, 2008. In the case of both Florida and Colorado, dual agency and sub-agency (where both listing and selling agents represent the seller) no longer exist. Other brokers and agents may focus on representing buyers or tenants in a real estate transaction. However, licensing as a broker or salesperson authorizes the licensee to legally represent parties on either side of a transaction and providing the necessary documentation for the legal transfer of real property. This business decision is for the licensee to decide. They are fines for people acting as real estate agents when not licensed by the state. In the United Kingdom, an estate agent is a person or business entity whose business is to market real estate on behalf of clients. There are significant differences between the actions, powers, obligations, and liabilities of brokers and estate agents in each country, as different countries take markedly different approaches to the marketing and selling of real property.  Written agreement It is important to have a clear written legal documentation for an agreement between the broker and the client, for the protection of both of them. If the parties only have an oral agreement, it is more likely for a dispute to arise concerning the agreement to represent clients and for how real property being sold. Legal documentation is required to define whether the broker can enforce the parties' compensation agreement, the duration of the relationship, whether the relationship is \\"exclusive\\", and other issues. Enforceability of oral agreements, what kinds of legal agreements are required to be in writing, and other important issues vary from state to state.  Real estate education  To become licensed, most states require that an applicant take a minimum number of classroom hours to study real estate law before taking the state licensing exam. Such education is often provided by real estate firms or by education companies, either of which is typically licensed to teach such courses within their respective states. The courses are designed to prepare the new licensee primarily for the legal aspects of the practice of transferring real estate and to pass the state licensing exam. Once licensed, the licensee in most states is initially designated a salesperson and must work under a broker's license. Some other states have recently eliminated the salesperson's license and instead, all licensees in those states automatically earn their broker's license. A real estate agent must place their license under a managing broker. Typically there may be multiple licensees holding broker's licenses within a firm but only one broker or the firm itself, is the managing or principal broker and that individual or firm is then legally responsible for all licensees held under their license. The term agent is not to be confused with salesperson or broker. An agent is simply a licensee that has entered into an agency relationship with a client. A broker can also be an agent for a client. It is commonly the firm that has the actual legal relationship with the client through one of their sales staff, be they salespersons or brokers. In all states, the real estate licensee must disclose to prospective buyers and sellers the nature of their relationship within the transaction and with the parties. See below for a broker/licensee relationship to sellers and their relationship with buyers. In the United States, there are commonly two levels of real estate professionals licensed by the individual states but not by the federal government:  The difference between salespersons and brokers  Before the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) was introduced in 1967, when brokers (and their licensees) only represented sellers by providing a service to provide legal documentation on the transfer real property, the term \\"real estate salesperson\\" may have been more appropriate than it is today, given the various ways that brokers and licensees now help buyers through the legal process of transferring real property. Legally, however, the term \\"salesperson\\" is still used in many states to describe a real estate licensee. Real estate salesperson (or, in some states, real estate broker) When a person first becomes licensed to become a real estate agent, they obtain a real estate salesperson's license (some states use the term \\"broker\\") from the state in which they will practice. To obtain a real estate license, the candidate must take specific coursework (between 40 and 120 hours) and pass a state exam on real estate law and practice. To work, salespersons must be associated with (and act under the authority of) a real estate broker. In Delaware, for example, the licensing course requires the candidate to take 99 classroom hours in order to qualify to sit for the state and national examination. In Ohio, a license candidate must complete 120 hours of classroom education. Each successive year thereafter, the license holder must participate in continuing education in order to remain abreast of state and national changes. Many states also have reciprocal agreements with other states, allowing a licensed individual from a qualified state to take the second state's exam without completing the course requirements or, in some cases, take only a state law exam. Real estate broker (or, in some states, qualifying broker) After gaining some years of experience in real estate sales, a salesperson may decide to become licensed as a real estate broker (or Principal/qualifying broker) in order to own, manage, or operate their own brokerage. In addition, some states allow college graduates to apply for a broker's license without years of experience. College graduates fall into this category once they have completed the state-required courses as well. California allows licensed attorneys to become brokers upon passing the broker exam without having to take the requisite courses required of an agent. Commonly more coursework and a broker's state exam on real estate law must be passed. Upon obtaining a broker's license, a real estate agent may continue to work for another broker in a similar capacity as before (often referred to as a broker associate or associate broker) or take charge of their own brokerage and hire other salespersons (or broker), licensees. Becoming a branch office manager may or may not require a broker's license. Some states allow licensed attorneys to become real estate brokers without taking any exam. In some states, there are no \\"salespeople\\" as all licensees are brokers. Agency relationships with clients versus non-agency relationships with customers * Relationship: Conventionally, the broker provides a conventional full-service, commission-based brokerage relationship under a signed listing agreement with a seller or a \\"buyer representation\\" agreement with a buyer, thus creating under common law in most states an agency relationship with fiduciary obligations. The seller or buyer is then a client of the broker. Some states also have statutes that define and control the nature of the representation. Agency relationships in residential real estate transactions involve the legal representation by a real estate broker (on behalf of a real estate company) of the principal, whether that person(s) is a buyer or a seller. The broker and his licensed real estate salespersons (salesmen or brokers) then become the agents of the principal. * Non-agency relationship: where no written agreement or fiduciary relationship exists, a real estate broker and his sales staff work with a principal who is known as the broker's customer. When a buyer who has not entered into a Buyer Agency agreement with the broker buys a property, that broker functions as the sub-agent of the seller's broker. When a seller chooses to work with a transaction broker, there is no agency relationship created. Designated agency The most recent development in the practice of real estate is \\"designated agency\\" which was created to permit individual licensees within the same firm, designated by the principal broker, to act as agents for individual buyers and sellers within the same transaction. In theory, therefore, two agents within the same firm act in strict fiduciary roles for their respective clients. Some states have adopted this practice into their state laws and others have decided this function is inherently problematic, just as was a dual agency. The practice was invented and promoted by larger firms to make it possible in theory to handle the entire transaction in the house without creating a conflict of interest within the firm Types of services that a broker can provide Real Estate Services are also called trading services by some jurisdictions. Since each province's and state's laws may differ, it is generally advised that prospective sellers or buyers consult a licensed real estate professional. Some examples: * Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) ‚Äî an estimate of a property's value compared with others. This differs from an appraisal in that property currently for sale may be taken into consideration. (competition for the subject property) * Total Market Overview ‚Äî an objective method for determining a property's value, where a CMA is subjective. * Broker's Price Opinion ‚Äî estimate of a property's value or potential selling price * Real estate appraisal ‚Äî in most states, only if the broker is also licensed as an appraiser. * Exposure ‚Äî Marketing the real property to prospective buyers. * Facilitating a Purchase ‚Äî guiding a buyer through the process. * Facilitating a Sale ‚Äî guiding a seller through the selling process. * FSBO document preparation ‚Äî preparing the necessary paperwork for \\"For Sale By Owner\\" sellers. * Home Selling Kits ‚Äî guides advising how to market and sell a property. * Hourly Consulting for a fee, based on the client's needs. * Leasing for a fee or percentage of the gross lease value. * Property Management * Exchanging property. * Auctioning property. -in most states, only if the broker is also licensed as an auctioneer. * Preparing contracts and leases. (not in all states) These services are also changing as a variety of real estate trends transform the industry. Real estate brokers and sellers=Services provided to seller as client Upon signing a listing contract with the seller wishing to sell the real estate, the brokerage attempts to earn a commission by finding a buyer and writing an offer, a legal document, for the sellers' property for the highest possible price on the best terms for the seller. In Canada and the United States, most laws require the real estate agent to forward all written offers to the seller for consideration or review. To help accomplish the goal of finding buyers, a real estate agency commonly does the following: * Lists the property for sale to the public, often on an MLS, in addition to any other methods. * Provides the seller with a real property condition disclosure (if required by law) and other necessary forms. * Keeps the client abreast of the rapid changes in the real estate industry, swings in market conditions, and the availability and demand for property inventory in the area. * Prepares paperwork describing the property for advertising, pamphlets, open houses, etc. * Places a \\"For Sale\\" sign on the property indicating how to contact the real estate office and agent. * advertises the property, which may include social media and digital marketing in addition to paper advertising. * Holds an open house to show the property. * Serves as a contact available to answer any questions about the property and schedule showing appointments. * Ensures that buyers are pre-screened and financially qualified to buy the property. (Sellers should be aware that the underwriter for any real estate mortgage loan is the final say.) * Negotiates price on behalf of the sellers. * Prepares legal documentation or a ‚Äúpurchase and sale agreement‚Äù on how the transaction will proceed. * Acts as a fiduciary for the seller, which may include preparing a standard real estate purchase contract. * Holds an earnest payment cheque in escrow from the buyer(s) until the closing if necessary. In many states, the closing is the meeting between the buyer and seller where the property is transferred and the title is conveyed by a deed. In other states, especially those in the West, closings take place during a defined escrow period when buyers and sellers each sign the appropriate papers transferring title, but do not meet each other. * Negotiates on their client's behalf when a property inspection is complete. Often having to get estimates for repairs. *Guards the client's legal interests (along with the attorney) when facing tough negotiations or confusing contracts. The listing contract Several types of listing contracts exist between broker and seller. These may be defined as: * Exclusive right to sell The broker is given the exclusive right to market the property and represents the seller exclusively. This is referred to as seller agency. However, the brokerage also offers to cooperate with other brokers and agrees to allow them to show the property to prospective buyers and offers a share of the total real estate commission. * Exclusive agency Exclusive agency allows only the broker the right to sell the property, and no offer of compensation is ever made to another broker. In this case, the property will never be entered into an MLS. Naturally, this limits the exposure of the property to only one agency. * Open listing The property is available for sale by any real estate professional who can advertise, show, or negotiate the sale. The broker/agent who first brings an acceptable offer would receive compensation. Real estate companies will typically require that a written agreement for an open listing be signed by the seller to ensure payment of a commission if a sale takes place. Although there can be other ways of doing business, a real estate brokerage usually earns its commission after the real estate broker and a seller enter into a listing contract and fulfill agreed- upon terms specified within that contract. The seller's real estate is then listed for sale. In most of North America, a listing agreement or contract between broker and seller must include the following: * starting and ending dates of the agreement; * the price at which the property will be offered for sale; * the amount of compensation due to the broker; * how much, if any, of the compensation, will be offered to a cooperating broker who may bring a buyer (required for MLS listings). Net listings: Property listings at an agreed-upon net price that the seller wishes to receive with any excess going to the broker as commission. In many states including Georgia, New Jersey and Virginia [18 VAC ¬ß135-20-280(5)] net listings are illegal, other states such as California and Texas state authorities discourage the practice and have laws to try and avoid manipulation and unfair transactions [22 TAC ¬ß535(b)] and (c). Brokerage commissions In consideration of the brokerage successfully finding a buyer for the property, a broker anticipates receiving a commission for the services the brokerage has provided. Usually, the payment of a commission to the brokerage is contingent upon finding a buyer for the real estate, the successful negotiation of a purchase contract between the buyer and seller, or the settlement of the transaction and the exchange of money between buyer and seller. Under common law, a real estate broker is eligible to receive their commission, regardless of whether the sale actually takes place, once they secure a buyer who is ready, willing, and able to purchase the dwelling.https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/almID/1202588713813/Getting-a- Brokerage-Commission-Paid/ The median real estate commission charged to the seller by the listing (seller's) agent is 6% of the purchase price. Typically, this commission is split evenly between the seller's and buyer's agents, with the buyer's agent generally receiving a commission of 3% of the purchase price of the home sold. In North America, commissions on real estate transactions are negotiable and new services in real estate trends have created ways to negotiate rates. Local real estate sales activity usually dictates the amount of agreed commission. Real estate commission is typically paid by the seller at the closing of the transaction as detailed in the listing agreement. Economist Steven D. Levitt famously argued in his 2005 book Freakonomics that real estate brokers have an inherent conflict of interest with the sellers they represent because their commission gives them more motivation to sell quickly than to sell at a higher price. Levitt supported his argument with a study finding brokers tend to put their own houses on the market for longer and receive higher prices for them compared to when working for their clients. He concluded that broker commissions will reduce in future. A 2008 study by other economists found that when comparing brokerage without listing services, brokerage significantly reduced the average sale price. =RESPA= Real estate brokers who work with lenders can not receive any compensation from the lender for referring a residential client to a specific lender. To do so would be a violation of a United States federal law known as the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). Commercial transactions are exempt from RESPA. All lender compensation to a broker must be disclosed to all parties. A commission may also be paid during negotiation of contract base on seller and agent. = Lock-box = With the seller's permission, a lock-box is placed on homes that are occupied, and after arranging an appointment with the homeowner, agents can show the home to prospective buyers. When a property is vacant, a lock-box will generally be placed on the front door. The listing broker helps arrange showings of the property by various real estate agents from all companies associated with the MLS. The lock-box contains the key to the door of the property, and the box can only be opened by licensed real estate agents. Shared commissions with co-op brokers If any buyer's broker or his agents brings the buyer for the property, the buyer's broker would typically be compensated with a co-op commission coming from the total offered to the listing broker, often about half of the full commission from the seller. If an agent or salesperson working for the buyer's broker brings the buyer for the property, then the buyer's broker would commonly compensate his agent with a fraction of the co-op commission, again as determined in a separate agreement. A discount brokerage may offer a reduced commission if no other brokerage firm is involved and no co-op commission paid out. If there is no co-commission to pay to another brokerage, the listing brokerage receives the full amount of the commission minus any other types of expenses. Real estate brokers and buyers=Services provided to buyers Buyers as clients = With the increase in the practice of buyer brokerages in the United States, agents (acting under their brokers) have been able to represent buyers in the transaction with a written \\"Buyer Agency Agreement\\" not unlike the \\"Listing Agreement\\" for sellers referred to above. In this case, buyers are clients of the brokerage. Some brokerages represent buyers only and are known as exclusive buyer agents (EBAs). Consumer Reports states, \\"You can find a true buyer's agent only at a firm that does not accept listings.\\"Consumer Reports, May 2005 The advantages of using an Exclusive Buyer Agent is that they avoid conflicts of interest by working in the best interests of the buyer and not the seller, avoid homes and neighborhoods likely to fare poorly in the marketplace, ensure the buyer does not unknowingly overpay for a property, fully inform the buyer of adverse conditions, encourage the buyer to make offers based on true value instead of list price, and work to save the buyer money. A buyer agency firm commissioned a study that found EBA purchased homes were 17 times less likely to go into foreclosure. A real estate brokerage attempts to do the following for the buyers of real estate only when they represent the buyers with some form of written buyer-brokerage agreement: * Find real estate in accordance with the buyers needs, specifications, and cost. * Take buyers to and shows them properties available for sale. * Pre- screen buyers to ensure they are financially qualified to buy the properties shown (or use a mortgage professional, such a bank's mortgage specialist or alternatively a Mortgage broker, to do that task). * Negotiate price and terms on behalf of the buyers. * Prepare standard real estate purchase contract. * Act as a fiduciary for the buyer. * Find real estate in accordance with the buyers' needs, specifications, and affordability. * Assist the buyer in making an offer for the property. = Buyers as customers = In most states until the 1990s, buyers who worked with an agent of a real estate broker in finding a house were customers of the brokerage since the broker represented only sellers. Today, state laws differ. Buyers or sellers may be represented. Typically, a written \\"Buyer Brokerage\\" agreement is required for the buyer to have representation (regardless of which party is paying the commission), although by his/her actions, an agent can create representation. Education A person may attend a pre-license course lasting 60 hours and then be tested by the state for a real estate agent's license. Upon passing, the new licensee must place their license with an established real estate firm, managed by a broker. Requirements vary by state but after some period of time working as an agent, one may return to the classroom and test to become a broker. For example, California and Florida require you to have a minimum experience of two years as a full-time licensed agent within the prior 5 years. Where as Indiana only requires one year experience as a real estate salesperson and Arizona requires three out of the prior five years. Brokers may manage or own firms. Each branch office of a larger real estate firm must be managed by a broker. States issue licenses for a multi year period and require real estate agents and brokers to complete continuing education prior to renewing their licenses. For example, California licensees must complete 45 hours of continuing education every 4 years in topics such as agency, trust fund handling, consumer protection, fair housing, ethics, and risk management. Many states recognize licenses from other states and issue licenses to existing agents and firms upon request without additional education or testing however the license must be granted before real estate service is provided in the state. California does not have license reciprocity with other states. An applicant for licensure is not, however, required to be a resident of California to obtain a license. In Illinois, the salesperson license was replaced by a broker license in 2011. the new license requires 90 hours of pre-license education, 15 of which must be interactive, and 30 hours of post- license education. The pre-license education requirement includes a 75-hour topics course and a 15-hour applied real estate principles course. Organizations Several notable groups exist to promote the real estate industry and to assist members who are in it. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) is the largest real estate organization and one of the largest trade groups anywhere. Their membership exceeds one million. NAR also has state chapters as well as thousands of local chapters. Upon joining a local chapter, a new member is automatically enrolled in the state and national organizations. When the principals of a firm join, all licensed agents in that firm must also belong. A Realtor is a real estate broker or salesperson who is also a member of the National Association of Realtors, which is an industry trade association. The word \\"Realtor\\" is a registered trademark, protected under the US and international law. The Realtor Political Action Committee (RPAC) is a separate entity, and also the lobbying arm of NAR. In 2005, they were considered the largest PAC in the United States. According to realtor.org, RPAC is the largest contributor to direct contributions to federal candidates. The National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB) was founded in 1947 as an alternative for African Americans who were excluded from the dominant NAR. Both groups allow members to join without regard to race. However, NAREB has historically been an African American-centric group with a focus on developing housing resources for intercity populations. The Real Estate Institute of Canada (REIC) was established in 1955 and is a not- for-profit membership organization offering continuing education courses and designation programs for Canadian real estate professionals across multiple sectors.

He has a particularly complex and controversial ancestry, as he may fall under Dongyi Miao or even Man, depending on the source and view. Today, Chiyou is honored and worshipped as the God of War and one of the three legendary founding fathers of China. Description=Individual According to the Song dynasty history book Lushi, Chiyou's surname was Jiang (), and he was a descendant of Yandi. According to legend, Chiyou had a bronze head with a metal forehead. He had 4 eyes and 6 arms, wielding terrible sharp weapons in every hand. (2005) (2006) . p 11-13. In some sources, Chiyou had certain features associated with various mythological bovines: his head was that of a bull with two horns, although the body was that of a human, and his hindquarters were those of a bear. He is said to have been unbelievably fierce, and to have had 81 brothers. Historical sources often described him as 'bold leader', as well as 'brave'. Some sources have asserted that the figure 81 should rather be associated with 81 clans in his kingdom. Chiyou knows the constellations and the ancients spells for calling upon the weather. For example, he called upon a fog to surround Huangdi and his soldiers during the Battle of Zhuolu. Tribe Chiyou (Txiv Yawg) is regarded as a leader of the Nine Li tribe (, RPA ) by nearly all sources. However, his exact ethnic affiliations are quite complex, with multiple sources reporting him as belonging to various tribes, in addition to a number of diverse peoples supposed to have directly descended from him. Some sources from later dynasties, such as the Guoyu book, considered Chiyou's Li tribe to be related to the ancient San miao tribe ().() In the ancient Zhuolu Town is a statue of Chiyou commemorating him as the original ancestor of the Hmong people.De la Cadena, Marisol. Starn, Orin. Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. [2007] (2007). Indigenous experience today. Berg Publishers, 2007. . pg 239. The place is regarded as the birthplace of the San miao / Miao people, the Hmong being a subgroup of the Miao. In sources following the Hmong view, the \\"nine Li\\" tribe is called the \\"Jiuli\\" kingdom, Jiuli meaning \\"nine Li\\". Modern Han Chinese scholar Weng Dujian considers Jiuli and San Miao to be Man southerners. Chiyou has also been counted as part of the Dongyi. Epic battles Map showing the location of the Battle of Zhuolu and Chiyou's tribe When the Yan emperor was leading his tribe and conflicts with Nine Li tribes led by Chiyou, the Yan emperor stood no chance and lost the fight. He escaped, and later ended up in Zhuolu begging for help from the Yellow Emperor. At this point the epic battle between Chiyou and the Yellow Emperor's forces began. The battle last for 10 years with Chiyou having the upper hand. During the Battle of Zhuolu, Chiyou breathed out a thick fog and obscured the sunlight.Big5.china.com.cn. \\"Big5.china.com.cn.\\" ' Retrieved on 2010-08-22. The battle dragged on for days while the emperor's side was in danger. Only after the Yellow Emperor invented the south-pointing chariot, did he find his way out of the battlefield. Chiyou then conjured up a heavy storm. The Yellow Emperor then called upon the drought demon N√ºba (), who blew away the storm clouds and cleared the battlefield. Chiyou and his army could not hold up, and were later killed by the Yellow Emperor. After this defeat, the Yellow Emperor is said to become the ancestor of all Huaxia. The Hmong were forced to live in the mountains and leave their Li kingdom. After Chiyou's death, it is said that it rained blood for some time. Societal influence Nuo priests performing ritual at Chiyou Nuo Temple in Xinhua, Hunan According to the Records of the Grand Historian, Qin Shi Huang worshiped Chiyou as the God of War, and Liu Bang worshiped at Chiyou's shrine before his decisive battle against Xiang Yu. The mythical title God of War was given to Chiyou because the Yellow Emperor and Yan Emperor could not defeat Chiyou alone. Altogether, Chiyou won 9 major battles including 80 minor confrontations. On the 10th and final war, both emperors combined their forces and conquered Chiyou. Chiyou remains as a figure of worship today. In one mythical episode, after Chiyou had claimed he could not be conquered, the goddess Nuwa dropped a stone tablet on him from Mount Tai. Chiyou failed to crush the stone, but still managed to escape. From then on, the 5-finger-shaped stone tablet, inscribed \\"Mount Tai shigandang\\" () became a spiritual weapon to ward off evil and disasters.Lee, James. [2006] (2006). James Lee Astrology guide 2006 Chinese edition. World publishing co. . p 208-209.

He was the Vice President under the Iraqi Transitional Government in 2006, and was Interim President of Iraq under the Iraqi Interim Government from 2004 to 2005. He also served as the President of the Governing Council of Iraq in 2004. Al-Yawar was originally a member of the Iraqi Governing Council created following the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2004 he was appointed by the council to serve as interim President of Iraq following the 28 June return of Iraqi sovereignty from the Coalition Provisional Authority. Early life and education Born in Mosul, Iraq in 1958, al-Yawar completed his primary and secondary education in Iraq. He then went on to study in King Fahd University for Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) for two years before completing his BSc in civil engineering in the UK. Al-Yawar enrolled in an English language program at American University in Washington, D.C. and then received his master's degree from George Washington University in the mid 1980s. The House of Yawar has been the head of the Shammar tribe for centuries. The Shammar is one of Iraq's biggest tribal confederations with more than 1.5 million people covering vast territories from Iraq into Syria and Saudi Arabia. Composed of both Sunnis and Shiites, the Shammar are generally religiously and politically moderate. \\"My mother would take me to visit the holy shrines in Najaf and Karbala, in addition to the Sunni mosques in Baghdad and St. Mary's Church,\\" Yawar told the Iraqi paper Al Zaman. This had an impact on al-Yawar's leadership approach later in his political career, and one that made a lasting impression. According to Jaffar Saheb Said, an elder at the northern Baghdad shrine of Imam Kadhem, a Shiite saint, \\"he's deep-rooted and well-known among Arab clans. He's able to navigate between both Shias and Sunnis and solve their problems.\\"https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/PROFILE-Ghazi-Mashal- Ajil-al-Yawer-Under-2769482.php His uncle, Sheikh Mohsen Ajil al-Yawar, is the current head of the Shammar tribe and his grandfather played a role in guiding Iraq towards independence in the 1920s, later serving as a member of the king's parliament. When al-Yawar's uncle refused to sanction Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 the family went into exile in London. Al-Yawar, who was then residing in Saudi Arabia, eschewed politics and instead established a successful telecommunications company. He spent much of the past two decades in Saudi Arabia, where he became vice president of a telecommunications company High Capabilities Co. (HiCap). Presidency After the toppling of Saddam Hussein in April 2003, al-Yawar returned to Iraq at the request of his uncle, Mohsen al-Yawar. Following the assassination of Iraqi Governing Council President Ezzedine Salim on 17 May 2004, Ghazi al-Yawar assumed the May rotating presidency for the Governing Council. During his term as interim president, leading up to the dissolution of the Governing Council, al-Yawar spoke out against the misperception that Arab Sunnis in Iraq enjoyed huge privileges under Saddam Hussein's rule. Al-Yawar adamantly affirmed that \\"Saddam did not believe in any religion or sect ‚Äì his injustices were inflicted on Sunnis, Shi'is, Kurds and all other national groups and sects. He did not differentiate between one Iraqi and another.\\" Al-Yawar was scheduled to be the last holder of the rotating council presidency, with a term lasting until 30 June 2004, the date of the expected transition to official Iraqi sovereignty. Instead, he was chosen at an earlier date to be Iraq's formal Head of State, and occupy the largely symbolic post of \\"State President\\" of Iraq. Adnan Pachachi was preferred by UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, but most members of the Governing Council had favored al-Yawar. Members of the council had accused the UN of trying to impose a new Iraqi president against their wishes. The dispute delayed the announcement of the interim government that would lead Iraq from the end of the month, but on 1 June 2004 the special envoy to Iraq, Lakhdar Brahimi, confirmed Sheikh Ghazi's appointment as interim president. Ayad Allawi, who served as Prime Minister during al-Yawar's presidency, is a Shiite Muslim. The two collectively represented Iraq's largest Muslim sects. Al-Yawar and the Iraqi Interim Government were sworn in on 28 June 2004, when the U.S.-led coalition handed over power two days early. Sheikh Ghazi's selection as interim president, at first resisted and then accepted by the American administrators in Iraq, is further recognition of the tribal revival at this time. Although this post was described as largely ceremonial, it in fact exercised both symbolic and political sway. As a Sunni tribal leader, he reassured his fellow Sunnis while also representing a familiar type of authority figure for the tribal Kurds, and embodying traditional values esteemed by Shiite religious figures. Faleh A. Jabar, a senior fellow at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, called Sheikh Ghazi \\"a tribal figure who knows modern ways, not a modern leader who knows tribal ways. He is clever, cautious in choosing words and values the seniority of age, a supreme value in tribal people. Being a sheikh, you have to give the lead to each and everyone except yourself.\\" L. Paul Bremer in his memoirs indicated that George W. Bush himself urged the appointment of al- Yawar, as Bush \\"had been favorably impressed by Ghazi's open thanks to the Coalition for overthrowing Saddam and by his determination to continue the process to sovereignty and eventual democracy.\\" But to many Iraqis, Sheikh al- Yawar was part of the Governing Council, which had lost virtually all legitimacy after its inability to solve the military and political crisis that had erupted across Iraq in April. Al-Yawar had been openly critical of the sectarian Governing Council, often acknowledging that the council was more focused on survival than on serious issues, adding only to the country's problems. \\"We sit in the council while the country is burning and argue over procedure,\\" Sheikh Ghazi told the Christian Science Monitor. \\"We're like the Byzantines in Constantinople, debating whether angels are male or female with the barbarians at the gate.\\" Like Ayad Allawi, the prime minister, and many of the council members appointed to new jobs in the cabinet and ministries, he faced a struggle to live down his role as a former council member. Al-Yawar proved determined not to appear as a puppet of the Coalition forces. He pulled no punches when criticizing the United States for the dismal lack of security in Iraq. \\"We blame the United States 100 percent for the security in Iraq,\\" he said. \\"They occupied the country, disbanded the security agencies and for 10 months left Iraq's borders open for anyone to come in without a visa or even a passport.\\" In addition, Sheikh Ghazi condemned the U.S. for remaining in Saddam Hussein's former Republican Palace presidential compound and converting it to their embassy, as some reports suggested. \\"This is like someone who pokes his finger in another's eye,\\" he declared. President George W. Bush confers with al-Yawer during the 9 June 2004 G8 summit at Sea Island, GA. As the Coalition-led siege in Fallujah peaked during his term as interim president, al-Yawer openly disparaged the assault that only a few months earlier led him to almost resign from the Governing Council in protest of the Coalition's actions. He told Reuters \\"I completely disagree with those who see a need to decide the [Fallujah] matter through military action. The Coalition's handling of the crisis is wrong. It's like someone who fired bullets at his horse's head just because a fly landed on it; the horse died and the fly went away.\\" He condemned the actions of the coalition forces, holding them completely accountable (according to the UN resolution) for delivering safety and aid to the Iraqi people.  Post-presidency  Al-Yawar held the position as President of Iraq in an interim capacity until an elected Iraqi Parliament could select a new permanent president, as mandated in the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period. This happened on 6 April 2005 when Jalal Talabani was elected president, and al- Yawar, after much negotiation, accepted to serve as one of Iraq's two vice- presidents. As Vice-President, Sheikh Ghazi addressed some of the many challenges faced by the new government. Due to the boycott of elections by Iraqi Sunnis, al-Yawar stood by his conviction that the new constitution should not be written in light of the past elections that created a unique situation ‚Äì a complete sector of the Iraqi people were unable to partake in them. The election results were to be taken as the basis for a balance in drafting a constitution for all Iraqis. The constitution, as al-Yawar said in an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat, \\"was meant to be always for all the Iraqis and to look after them all and not be 100 percent the whims of a group, religion, or ideology but must have more common ground and denominators for the Iraqi people.\\" At this time, al-Yawar called for a separation between religion and politics, believing religion is too sacred to be polluted by politics. \\"Religion directs the country towards the public welfare and love while politics is much planning, maneuvers, prevarications and compromises and it is inappropriate for it to put on the cloak of religion.\\"\\"Iraqi Vice- President Criticizes Draft Constitution, Demands for Federations\\". Red Orbit. 27 August 2005 In the January 2005 Iraqi election for the Iraqi National Assembly, he was the leader of The Iraqis (Iraqioun), the largest secular list of candidates with a Sunni leader. His list won about 150,000 votes, 2% of the national vote. Al-Yawar, one of only a handful of Sunni leaders that did not boycott the elections and the only Sunni figure of national standing who appeared to have secured a place in the assembly, took five seats in Parliament. In the January 2006 election, he joined the Iraqi National List coalition with other secular politicians Ayad Allawi and Adnan Pachachi. He then became a member of the Iraqi Parliament and after a short period of time resigned from the Parliament to return to his private life. Although it was hard to find research or polling on the subject, a few Sunni commentators, such as \\"Riverbend\\" of Baghdad Burning, suggested that Ghazi al-Yawer's poor showing in the elections was largely because he was held in low esteem by common Sunni Iraqis, being called by the epithet \\"al Baqara al dhahika\\", which translates roughly as \\"the laughing cow\\". Personal life  Al-Yawar has been married since 1984 and has four children.

He served as Vice President of Iraq from 2014 to 2015 and from 2016 to 2018. Previously he was interim Prime Minister of Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and the President of the Governing Council of Iraq (38th Prime Minister of Iraq) in 2003. A prominent Iraqi political activist who lived in exile for almost 30 years, Allawi, a Shia Muslim, became a member of the Iraq Interim Governing Council, which was established by U.S.-led coalition authorities following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He became Iraq's first head of government since Saddam Hussein when the council dissolved on June 1, 2004 and named him Prime Minister of the Iraqi Interim Government. His term as Prime Minister ended on April 7, 2005, after the selection of Islamic Dawa Party leader Ibrahim al-Jaafari by the newly elected transitional Iraqi National Assembly. A former Ba'athist, Allawi helped found the Iraqi National Accord, which today is an active political party. In the lead up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the INA provided intelligence about alleged weapons of mass destruction to MI6. Allawi has lived about half of his life in the UK. His wife and children still live in the UK for their security. He survived assassination attempts in 1978, in 2004, and on April 20, 2005. Allawi's first name is sometimes rendered as Iyad or Eyad.  Allawi's early life  Allawi was born in 1944 to a prominent Shiite merchant family; his grandfather helped to negotiate Iraq's independence from Britain and his father was an Iraqi Member of Parliament. He became involved in Ba'athism at a young age and organized against the government of Abdul Karim Qassim. In the 1960s, he studied at medical school in Baghdad at Baghdad University. Previously, he had attended high school and college at Baghdad College, a Catholic, Jesuit high school and college. He obtained his master's degree at University College in London and performed a residency at Guy's Hospital. Allawi has three children, one of them, Hamza, studies in a school in Surrey. Allawi is related to Ahmed Chalabi, another prominent former exile who died in 2015, through Chalabi's sister. Former minister of trade Ali Allawi is Chalabi's sister's son as well as Ayad Allawi's cousin. The relationship between Chalabi and Allawi had been described as alternating between rivals and allies. In addition, Nouri Badran, interim Minister of Interior, is married to Iyad Allawi's sister. He is also a cousin of Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi.  Early political career  In 1971, he moved to London due to increasing differences with the Ba'ath party and in order to continue his medical education. He resigned from the Ba'ath party in 1975, \\"having decided that Saddam was exerting too much control over it\\". Allawi himself states that he remained active in the international Ba'athist movement, but had no ties to the Ba'ath Party's Iraqi Regional Branch. At first Saddam, then Iraq's vice president, pressured Allawi, who was in contact with senior military and party officers that were increasingly critical of Saddam, to rejoin the Ba'ath Party. In 1978, friends told Allawi that his name was on a liquidation list. In February 1978 Allawi was awoken in bed one night by an intruder in his Surrey home, who proceeded to attack him with an axe. The intruder left, convinced that Allawi was dead as he lay in a pool of blood. He survived the attempted murder, and spent the next year in hospital recovering from his injuries. His first wife, Atour, was also wounded in the attack. It is presumed that the attack was an assassination attempt ordered by Saddam Hussein. He separated with his wife after mutual agreement.  The Iraqi National Accord  While still recovering in hospital from the attack, Allawi started organising an opposition network to work against the government of Saddam Hussein. Through the 1980s he built this network, recruiting Iraqis while traveling as a businessman and for the UNDP. In December 1990, Allawi announced the existence of the Iraqi National Accord (INA). Six years later, using disillusioned Ba'athists in the military and government, it mounted an unsuccessful coup in Baghdad. One of Allawi's allies in the INA was Salah Omar Al-Ali, a former member of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council and ambassador to the United Nations. The INA received open backing from the UK, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United States. The group consisted mainly of former military personnel who had defected from Saddam Hussein's Iraq to instigate a military coup. Allawi established links and worked with the CIA in 1992 as a counterpoint to Chalabi, and because of the INA's links in the Ba'athist establishment. It is alleged Allawi's INA organised attacks in Iraq. This campaign never posed a threat to Saddam Hussein's rule, but was designed to test INA's capability to effect regime change. Though Saddam's government claimed the attacks have caused up to 100 civilian deaths there are no true records of these statistics to date.Andrew Gilligan \\"The Strongman of Baghdad\\" in The Spectator 13 November 2004 A military coup was planned for 1996, in which Iraqi generals were to lead their units against Baghdad and remove Saddam Hussein. The CIA supported the plot, code-named DBACHILLES, and added Iraqi officers that were not part of INA. The plan ended in disaster as it had been infiltrated by agents loyal to Saddam. US support was also questionable - requests by the CIA station chief in Amman for American air support were refused by the Clinton administration. Many participants were executed. Lands and factories belonging to the Allawi family were confiscated. Even their graveyard in Najaf was seized, although it was later returned. According to Allawi, his family lost $250M worth of assets. US support for INA continued, receiving $6 million in covert aid in 1996 and $5 million in 1995 (according to books by David Wurmser as well as Andrew and Patrick Cockburn). The INA channelled the report from an Iraqi officer claiming that Iraq could deploy its supposed weapons of mass destruction within \\"45 minutes\\" to British Intelligence. This claim featured prominently in the September Dossier which the British government released in 2002 to gain public support for the Iraq invasion. In the aftermath of the war, the \\"45 minute claim\\" was also at the heart of the confrontation between the British government and the BBC, and the death of David Kelly later examined by Lord Hutton. Giving evidence to the Hutton Inquiry, the head of MI6 Richard Dearlove suggested that the claim related to battlefield weapons rather than weapons of mass destruction.  Post-Saddam  Shortly after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the Coalition Provisional Authority (the \\"CPA\\") was established by the occupying forces in order to administer the country until sovereignty could be restored. The CPA decided to establish a grouping of senior Iraqi politicians to carry out some administrative responsibilities, with a view to giving the occupation a more \\"Iraqi face\\". This grouping was referred to as the Governing Council, and was made up of 25 Iraqis that were appointed by the CPA. Allawi was one of those selected to serve on the Governing Council, and held the position of Minister of Defence (although his real responsibilities in that regard were limited considering Iraq remained under occupation). He held the rotating presidency of the interim governing council during October 2003. In April 2004, Allawi reportedly resigned as head of the IGC security committee over concerns of US bombing in Fallujah, according to a letter published in INA's newspaper. In December 2003, he flew to CIA headquarters in Langley together with fellow INA official Nouri Badran to discuss detailed plans for setting up a domestic secret service. The agency was to be headed by Badran, a former Ba'athist who served Saddam as an ambassador until 1990, and, controversially, recruited several agents for Saddam's Mukhabarat. When the Iraqi National Intelligence Service was set up in March 2004, its designated director was Mohammed Abdullah Mohammed al-Shehwani, another former Ba'athist exile with ties to INA.  Interim Prime Minister  On May 28, 2004, he was elected unanimously by the Governing Council to be the Interim Prime Minister of Iraq to govern the country beginning with the United States' handover of sovereignty (June 30, 2004) until national elections, scheduled for early 2005. Although many believe the decision was reached largely on the advice of United Nations special envoy to Iraq, Lakhdar Brahimi, The New York Times reported that Brahimi only endorsed him reluctantly after pressure from U.S. officials. (In response to a question about the role of the U.S. in Allawi's appointment, Brahimi replied: \\"I sometimes say, I'm sure he doesn't mind me saying that, Bremer is the dictator of Iraq. He has the money. He has the signature. Nothing happens without his agreement in this country.\\") Two weeks later, Brahimi announced his resignation, due to \\"great difficulties and frustration\\". Allawi meets with U.S. President George W. Bush in New York, 21 September 2004 At the time of his nomination, Allawi was often described in the US mainstream media as a moderate Shia, a member of Iraq's majority faith, chosen for his secular, national views. On June 28, 2004 (two days early), the U.S.-led coalition handed over power to Allawi and the Iraqi Interim Government, who were sworn in later that same day. After his interim government assumed legal custody of Saddam Hussein and re-introduced capital punishment, Allawi gave assurances that he would not interfere with the trial and would accept any court decisions. In an interview with Dubai-based TV station Al Arabiya he said: \\"As for the execution, that is for the court to decide‚Äîso long as a decision is reached impartially and fairly.\\" Allawi's government also wrote a new emergency regulation, which allows the executive branch to declare martial law, impose curfews and detain suspects. Paul Bremer's aides said Allawi lacked the power to impose martial law, and Secretary of State Colin Powell warned that the U.S. would not support such a move. \\"The last thing we want,\\" says a senior U.S. official, \\"is for the world to think we're foisting a new strongman on Iraq.\\" Though, in addition to the stick of martial law, the government planned to offer a carrot of a broad amnesty for insurgents who have taken up arms against the U.S.-led occupation forces. Allawi himself has made clear that his government will reach out to Iraqi insurgents who have fought the Coalition for \\"patriotic motives\\" while seeking to isolate and destroy foreign elements such as the network led by the Jordanian jihadist Musab al-Zarqawi. Allawi knew that both the Sunni insurgency and the one waged by supporters of Shiite firebrand Moqtada Sadr have significant popular support, while his own government has yet to win the loyalty of Iraqis. On July 18, Iraqi militants offered a $285,000 reward for anyone who could kill Iyad Allawi. During the summer of 2004, Allawi made several decisions seen as controversial at the time, but later worked in his interest as they demonstrated to Iraqis that Allawi did not favour one sect over another, and that he was a strong leader not afraid to use force to bring back the rule of law. Most notably, his decision to support the military incursions of both Najaf and Falluja made him extremely unpopular amongst some Iraqis at the time. He also announced the creation of General Security Directorate, a domestic spy agency, whose main role is to counteract terrorist groups and the Iraqi insurgency. Allawi led the Iraqi National Accord during the January 2005 Iraqi election. His campaign was mainly characterised by his attempt to combat the character assassination that was led by Iranian- sponsored groups. His campaign suffered when he visited the Imam Ali shrine in Najaf on December 4, 2004, where an unknown group attacked him. Allawi claimed that it was an assassination attempt. The INA came in at third place in the first elections, with 14% of the vote, which on a party versus coalition makes him head one of the largest represented parties. In the 2010 elections, Allawi's list won the most votes and beat incumbent Prime Minister Nuri al- Maliki by 2 seats. Assassination attempt On 3 December 2004 Rafik Yousef and two other men, all members of Ansar al-Islam were arrested, and later convicted, of planning to assassinate Allawi. In one tape in August 2004, a speaker identified as Abu Anas al-Shami (second man of Zarqawi and leader of Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad made up mostly by foreigners) said the militants planned to kill Iraqi prime minister Ayad Allawi, soldiers and police officers.  Post-Prime Ministership  In preparation for the next parliamentary elections that took place in Iraq in December 2005, Allawi formed an alliance between many groups, including secular Sunni and Shia groups and the Iraqi Communist Party under one electoral list (the Iraqi National List). The Iraqi National List was represented in the coalition government led by Nouri al-Maliki, but Allawi himself did not take a Cabinet post. The party eventually boycotted the government in 2007.McClatchy Washington Bureau  08/06/2007  Iraqi government unraveling as more ministers boycott In preparation for upcoming national elections, Allawi formed a new coalition with leading Shia politician Iskander Witwit (one of the leaders of the 1991 uprising against Saddam), Shia tribal Sheikh Hussein al-Shalan, the deputy Prime Minister Rafi al-Issawi, Sunni politician Saleh Mutlaq and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi called the Iraqi National Movement. The 2010 parliamentary election ended with a weeks-long wait for an announcement of results by the Iraqi election commission. When the results finally came on March 26, 2010, Allawi's Iraqiya bloc was declared the biggest winner of the parliamentary election with two seats more than Allawi's rival al-Maliki's party in the Assembly. He was appointed one of the three Vice Presidents of Iraq by new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on 8 September 2014. On 11 August 2015, the Parliament approved a reform package by Prime Minister al-Abadi that foresaw, among other measures, the elimination of the three vice president posts. However, following a lawsuit filed by fellow Vice President Usama al- Nujayfi, al-Maliki declared in September 2015 that he was still holding his office because removing the post was not in line with the Iraqi Constitution. Osama al-Nujaifi filed a complaint against the decision in November 2015, calling it unconstitutional. On 10 October 2016, the three posts of Vice Presidents were restored by the Supreme Court of Iraq which termed their abolition unconstitutional. Allawi stated on 17 April 2017 that he had received information from Iraqi and regional contacts knowledgeable about Iraq that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group was in talks with al-Qaeda about a possible alliance. He added that even if the group lost all of its territory, its insurgency in the form of sleeper cells will continue.  Personal life  Allawi allegedly has faced several assassination attempts in England and throughout the Middle East, purportedly by agents of Saddam's regime.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3757923.stm Profile: Iyad Allawi According to Mossack Fonseca documents that came to light in the Panama Papers release by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in 2016, Allawi had Mossack Fonseca supply a nominee director to stand in for him and shield his ownership of the Panama-registered company IMF Holdings. This company was dissolved in 2013; it had owned a $1.5 million house near London. A second offshore, Moonlight Estates, registered in the British Virgin Islands, also held a property in London on his behalf. His media contact confirmed his sole ownership of the two companies and of Foxwood Estates as well, saying IMF was set up to own real estate for security reasons based on legal advice following an assassination attempt, and added that any income from the properties was reported, and taxes paid \\"promptly and on time.\\" He is cousin of Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi.

In February 2004, he reported that Sistani had survived an assassination attempt, although this was denied publicly by Sistani and his aides.

Wisborg Castle in an early 17th-century drawing The first Count: Oscar Bernadotte. Count of Wisborg (; ; ) is a title granted by the monarchs of Luxembourg to some men formerly titled as princes of Sweden and their descendants. Since 1892, the title has been borne by the male-line descendants of four princes of Sweden who married without the consent of the King of Sweden and thereby lost their right of succession to the throne of Sweden for themselves and their descendants, and had their Swedish royal titles prohibited.Gunnar Bramst√•ng in 'Tronr√§tt, b√∂rdstitel och hustillh√∂righet p. 54-55 The four former princes of Sweden, after use of their Swedish titles no longer was allowed, assumed the surname of Bernadotte. In each case they were given the title of nobility Prince Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg by the reigning Grand Duke or Grand Duchess of Luxembourg.The Royalty, peerage and aristocracy of the world, Vol 90 The latter title (count or countess) was shared with the children of each prince, since subsequent generations in the male line were authorized to bear only the title \\"Count of Wisborg\\", Bernadotte being recognized as their surname by birth. In some cases, this titulature has not been adhered to, usage of the style Count [Firstname] Bernadotte af Wisborg having been adopted by some of the descendants. In Sweden, a few of these people from the House of Bernadotte have been considered members of the unintroduced nobility, and have thus been members of a private club called Ointroducerad Adels F√∂rening. Their legitimate titles of nobility, however, have not been Swedish but Luxembourgish. The original four Counts of Wisborg The four former princes of Sweden given the title Count of Wisborg were: * Prince Oscar, Duke of Gotland (1859-1953), second son of King Oscar II of Sweden. He married morganatically and gave up his Swedish titles on March 15, 1888. He and his wife were invested with the new titles of Prince and Princess Bernadotte on their wedding day.Burke's Royal Families of the World vol. I 1977, p. 512. It has never been determined if this was a Swedish title of nobility or another form of unofficial courtesy title (such as some later dynasty members have been given by Swedish kings). On 2 April 1892, named as Oscar Prince Bernadotte, he was also given a hereditary title as Count of Wisborg by his uncle Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, previously Duke of Nassau. Oscar's mother, Queen Sofia of Sweden, was a half-sister of Grand Duke Adolphe.Lettres Patentes du Grand Duc Adolphe 1892-04-02 The choice of the Wisborg title was because Oscar was formerly Duke of Gotland and the castle of Visborg (then spelled Wisborg) is in Gotland. * Prince Lennart, Duke of Sm√•land (1909-2004), only son of Prince Wilhelm, Duke of S√∂dermanland and a grandson of King Gustaf V of Sweden. He married morganatically and had his Swedish titles prohibited on March 11, 1932. He was given the same titles as his granduncle Oscar by Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg on July 2, 1951.M√©morial du Grand Duch√© de Luxembourg 1951-08-13 p 1135 Lennart styled himself in no other language than German, and then as Prof. Dr. h.c. mult.

He married morganatically and had his Swedish titles prohibited on March 8, 1934. He was given the same titles as his cousin Lennart simultaneously by Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg on July 2, 1951. On May 28, 1983 Sigvard in Sweden formally announced his title as Prince Sigvard Bernadotte. His nephew King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden has consistently declined to respondMarianne Bernadotte in Glimtar och scener Norstedts Stockholm 1986 (Swedish) and his court has refused to use that title for his uncle. * Prince Carl Johan, Duke of Dalarna (1916-2012), fourth son of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden. He married morganatically and relinquished his Swedish titles on February 19, 1946. He was ennobled just as his brother Sigvard by Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg on July 2, 1951. He was the last surviving great-grandchild of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Carl Johan for many years was chairman of Ointroducerad Adels F√∂rening. A fifth prince of Sweden, Prince Carl, Duke of √ñsterg√∂tland (1911-2003), only son of Prince Carl, Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland and grandson of King Oscar II, married morganatically and relinquished his Swedish titles in 1937. He was given the title Prince Bernadotte by his brother-in-law King Leopold III of Belgium. His male-line descendants would have borne the title Count Bernadotte, but in fact his only child is a daughter (Mrs. Madeleine Kogevinas, Countess Madeleine Bernadotte).

They are typically found on the bottom of shallow marine waters, and some species (e.g. common bloodworms) can grow up to 35 centimetres (14 in) in length. Anatomy Bloodworms have a creamy pink color, as their pale skin allows their red body fluids that contain hemoglobin to show through. This is the origin of the name \\"bloodworm\\". At the 'head', bloodworms have four small antennae and small fleshy projections called parapodia running down their bodies. Bloodworms can grow up to in length. Bloodworms are carnivorous. They feed by extending a large proboscis that bears four hollow jaws. The jaws are connected to glands that supply venom which they use to kill their prey, and their bite is painful even to a human. They are preyed on by other worms, by bottom-feeding fish and crustaceans, and by gulls. Reproduction occurs in midsummer, when the warmer water temperature and lunar cycle among other factors triggers sexually mature worms to transform into a non-feeding stage called the epitoke. With enlarged parapodia, they swim to the surface of the water where both sexes release gametes, and then die. The first stage in many forms of bloodworm is a zooplanktonic stage followed by the benthic instar where the familiar segmented red larvae develop protected by silk tubes made in the bottom silt. These larvae progress from tiny pale opaque worms to the larger red larvae of 3 to 10 centimeters in length or longer over a period of as short a period as 2‚Äì3 weeks in optimum conditions. These animals are unique in that they contain a lot of copper without being poisoned. Their jaws are unusually strong since they too contain the metal in the form of a copper- based chloride biomineral, known as atacamite, in crystalline form. It is theorized that this copper is used as a catalyst for its venomous bite. Systematics Glycera is the type genus of the family Glyceridae.

Its history is characterized by intense controversy and persecution in reaction to some of the movement's doctrines and practices and their relationship to mainstream Christianity (see Mormonism and Christianity). The purpose of this article is to give an overview of the different groups, beliefs, and denominations that began with the influence of Joseph Smith. The founder of the Latter Day Saint movement was Joseph Smith, who was raised in the burned-over district of Upstate New York, and claimed that, in response to prayer, he saw God the Father and Jesus Christ, as well as angels and other visions. This eventually led him to a restoration of Christian doctrine that, he said, was lost after the early Christian apostles were killed. In addition, several early leaders made marked doctrinal and leadership contributions to the movement, including Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon, and Brigham Young. Modern-day revelation from God continues to be a principal belief of the Mormon faith. Mormon history as an academic field is called Mormon studies. Movement's historical context=Second Great Awakening and the Charismatic Movement The Latter Day Saint movement arose in the Palmyra and Manchester area of western New York, where its founder Joseph Smith was raised during a period of religious revival in the early 19th century called the Second Great Awakening, a Christian response to the secularism of the Age of Enlightenment which extended throughout the United States, particularly the frontier areas of the west. A significant early event in this Second Great Awakening was the Cane Ridge Revival, a large camp meeting that took place in 1801 at Cane Ridge, Kentucky. Joseph Smith's father Joseph Smith Sr. said he had several visions or dreams, as had Smith's paternal and maternal grandfathers. The people of western New York, like the rest of the United States at the time, were also influenced by folk religion. The fathers of both Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were reported to have used divining rods, though not by those within the LDS church. Joseph Smith used seer stones, which he used after his claimed First Vision. People of the time used such rods and stones in various ways, including to locate underground water, to find lost items, to locate buried treasure or mineral mines, as part of religious or magic rituals, or to communicate with spirits or angels. Until about the 1830s, the use of such divining media, even as a profession, was thought by many, though not all, as \\"honorable and profitable employment\\". (Palmyra Herald, July 24, 1822) Another related strand of religious thought that became important to the Latter Day Saint movement was the Restoration Movement, primarily influenced by Barton W. Stone (who participated in the Cane Ridge revival), and Alexander Campbell, who joined Stone in 1824 in Ohio. Stone and Campbell believed that the division among Christian sects had been caused by a Great Apostasy (or falling away) from the original teachings of Jesus, and that the correct principles of Christianity could be re-established by \\"restoring\\" practices described in the New Testament. The Restorationists also intended to eliminate sectarianism, arguing that there should be only one Christian church, which should be called the \\"Church of Christ.\\" While these restorationist ideas were circulating in the western frontier, the family of Joseph Smith was living in western New York, where they attended many of the local revivals. During this time, the area was seeing so many Christian revivals that western New York's most well-known revivalist Charles Grandison Finney later dubbed the area the \\"Burned-Over District\\". Because of a lack of clergy from established churches, this area was unusually open to religious innovations, new movements, and social experiments such as religious communism. Latter Day Saints do not typically distinguish between this Restoration movement and the broader Protestant Reformation, since both were an attempt by humans to return to the values and doctrines taught by Jesus and the Apostles, while most Latter Day Saint groups believe that there was a need for God to actively restore both authority and doctrine. However, in spite of their different use of the word restoration, this movement was an important part of the culture that led Joseph Smith to become interested in religion. Masonic influences Joseph Smith and several of the church founders were Freemasons, and were founding members of a lodge in Nauvoo, Illinois in March 1842. There are some similarities between Mormon temple worship and symbolism and the stories and symbols of Freemasonry. In modern times, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) holds no position for or against the compatibility of Masonry with LDS Church doctrine. Leadership of Joseph Smith=Origins of the movement The early men and women who came together to form what became known as the Latter Day Saint movement, shared some beliefs in common with other Restorationists, but certain factors made them unique. Although the movements shared a belief in the need to \\"restore\\" the \\"true church\\" of Jesus Christ, the early Latter Day Saints also believed that direct authority from God was essential for such a restoration to be valid. =Movement's early charismatic experiences= The beginning of Mormonism centers on a number of early charismatic experiences with the heavenly and the spiritual by Joseph Smith and his associates. Many of these experiences, such as visions, visits from angels, prophecy, and the hearing of God's voice, are still common parts of charismatic Christianity. Smith's First Vision Most Latter Day Saints trace the beginnings of Mormonism to Joseph Smith's First Vision, which he said he had in about 1820 in the woods near his home. Early accounts of this vision describe it as a vision of Jesus in which he was told his sins were forgiven. Later, more detailed accounts indicate Smith was also told that all Christian denominations had become corrupt and further clarify that Smith saw multiple heavenly beings, including Jesus and God the Father. Early visits by angels, Urim and Thummim, and the Book of Mormon Smith also described many other visions involving angels. Some of his earliest visitations involved a Nephite prophet-warrior, who called himself Moroni. Smith said this angel appeared to him many times, and showed him where to find a set of buried Golden Plates containing ancient writings that the prophet-warrior had sealed in a stone box before his death, together with other artifacts. The writings on the Golden Plates, according to Smith, contained an account of the various nations that inhabited ancient America, and described how they were led to the New World by Jesus, but eventually lost their Christian faith through a series of wars and corruption. After he said he received the Golden Plates, Smith began to dictate their translation to his wife Emma Hale Smith and various associates of his, including Martin Harris and, for most of the later translation, Oliver Cowdery. Smith said he translated the text through the gift and power of God and through the aid of the Urim and Thummim, or seer stone. The resulting writings were published in March 1830 as the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon was much more ambitious than being just a purported history of Native Americans. Mormons quickly adopted the book as a work of scripture of similar importance to the Bible. The book's title page described it as an attempt to show Native Americans \\"what great things the Lord has done for their fathers\\", and to convince \\"Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God.\\" (Book of Mormon, title page.) The book contained doctrinal discussions on numerous themes, including how the pride of the wealthy leads to the downfall of civilization, the dangers of \\"secret combinations\\" of people who meet secretly and use secret signs and oaths \\"to carry out the evil purposes of the group\\", and God's mercy and protection over his followers. Latter Day Saints consider the crowning moment of the book to be Jesus' visit to the ancient Americans, during which time he teaches them in person about the meaning of his death and resurrection. Shared experiences by Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, and restoration of the priesthood Some of the early movement's most important charismatic experiences were shared between Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, who joined the movement during the translation of the Book of Mormon. During the translation of the Golden Plates, Smith and Cowdery determined that they needed to obtain the Priesthood, or the authority to act in God's name, which they believed had been lost from the earth during the Great Apostasy. According to an account by Cowdery in 1834, they went into the woods near Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania on May 15, 1829, were visited by an angel who gave them the \\"Holy Priesthood\\". (Messenger and Advocate, 1(1), Oct. 1, 1834.) In 1835, Smith and Cowdery stated that the angel was John the Baptist, and that the \\"Holy Priesthood\\" was specifically the Priesthood of Aaron\\", which included the power to baptize. Today this area is preserved as the Aaronic Priesthood Restoration Site. Smith and Cowdery further elaborated for the 1835 publication of the Doctrine and Covenants that they were also later visited by Peter, James, and John, who restored the \\"keys of your ministry\\" and the \\"keys of the kingdom\\". Neither Smith nor Cowdery ever gave a date for this visitation. =Organization of the Church of Christ= Map of the eastern United States, showing locations important to the Latter Day Saint movement from 1830 to 1839. After the restoration of the Priesthood, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery began baptizing dozens of people, as early as June 1829. (History of the Church 1:6, p. 59). These converts did not belong to a formal church organization. Nevertheless, this community of believers referred to themselves as \\"the Church of Christ\\", and included converts in three New York towns: Fayette, Manchester, and Colesville. There is no known record of an early Mormon concept of the Lord's church prior to Smith's translation of the Book of Mormon from April to June 1829. Some time in April 1829, Smith dictated a story of Alma the Elder, the former priest of a wicked king, who baptized his followers by immersion, \\"having authority from the Almighty God\\", and called his community of believers the \\"church of God, or the church of Christ\\". Some time between June and December 1829, Joseph Smith, David Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery said they received a revelation about \\"how he should build up his church & the manner thereof\\". This revelation was called the \\"Articles of the Church of Christ\\", and it indicated that the church should ordain priests and teachers \\"according to the gifts & callings of God unto men\\". The church was to meet regularly to partake of bread and wine. Cowdery was described as \\"an Apostle of Jesus Christ\\". On April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and a group of approximately 50 believers met to formally organize the Church of Christ into a legal institution. By later accounts, this meeting was a charismatic event, in which members of the congregation had visions, prophesied, spoke in tongues, ecstatically shouted praises to the Lord, and fainted (Joseph Smith History, 1839 draft). Also, the church formally ordained a lay ministry. Smith and Cowdery, according to their 1831 account, were each ordained as \\"an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church\\". (\\"Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ\\", Painesville Telegraph, April 19, 1831). Movement in Ohio The movement more than doubled in size with the conversion of Sidney Rigdon, a former Campbellite minister, who led several congregations of Restorationists in Ohio's Western Reserve area, causing hundreds of his adherents to follow him into Mormonism. A fiery orator, Rigdon was called to be Smith's spokesman, and immediately became one of the movement's leaders. By 1831 the church's headquarters were established in Kirtland, Ohio, and Smith urged the membership to gather there or to a second outpost of the church in Far West, Missouri (see below). While based in Kirtland, the church changed its name to the \\"Church of the Latter Day Saints\\", and added a number of new doctrines and leadership offices. An attempt to establish a communitarian economy known as the \\"Law of Consecration\\" was established in 1831. The Latter Day Saint understanding of the priesthood was elaborated by the separation of the higher or Melchizedek Priesthood offices from the lesser or Aaronic Priesthood offices and by the restoration of the Patriarchal Priesthood. Also established were the First Presidency, the High Council ‚Äî later elaborated as the High Council of Zion, the Travelling High Council (or Quorum of the Twelve) and Stake high councils ‚Äî Seventies, patriarchs, high priests, and bishops. During the Kirtland era, many charismatic experiences were reported, many involving visitations of angels or communication from God through stones. However, some Church members claimed to receive revelations that contradicted those received by Joseph Smith. He and several followers prayed about the issue, and Joseph recorded a series of revelations, which included a description of several real spiritual gifts, a statement that only Joseph Smith, as the Prophet, could receive new doctrines and commandments for the Church, and a warning that not all supernatural experiences come from God. This effort to balance charismatic experience with order and stability became a lasting characteristic of the Latter Day Saint Movement. Kirtland also was the site of the construction of the movement's first temple. Latter Day Saints reported a great outpouring of spiritual experiences in connection with the Kirtland Temple's dedication. The temple was associated with the Kirtland-era \\"endowment\\", and with the temple ceremonies of \\"foot washing\\" and \\"solemn assembly.\\" The movement also established the \\"School of the Prophets\\" which met in the temple. At Kirtland, Smith reported many revelations including the \\"Word of Wisdom\\" ‚Äî advocating temperance and dietary restrictions. He acquired Egyptian papyrus scrolls which he said contained the writings of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham and Joseph. According to some reports, it was in Kirtland that Smith first began to practice the doctrine of plural marriage when he married Fanny Alger as his first plural wife in 1833. In 1837 Smith and Rigdon founded an \\"anti-bank\\" called the Kirtland Safety Society. When it failed, some 300 of the Kirtland membership became disillusioned, including a third of the church leadership.Anderson, Karl Ricks, Joseph Smith's Kirtland: Eyewitness Accounts, 1989 The result was the movement's first major schism. A new organization led by Smith's former secretary, Warren Parish, along with Martin Harris and others, vied for control of the church in Kirtland. Re-establishing the original \\"Church of Christ\\" name, these \\"reformed Latter Day Saints\\" took possession of the temple and excommunicated Smith and Rigdon. Smith and Rigdon relocated to Missouri and were followed there by hundreds of loyalists in a trek known as the \\"Kirtland Camp.\\" Movement in Missouri As the church was gathering to Kirtland, a second gathering place was established 900 miles distant, on the frontier in Jackson County, Missouri. Joseph Smith had revealed to Latter Day Saints that they were to prepare \\"the way of the Lord for his Second Coming\\", \\"for the time is soon at hand that I shall come....\\" (D & C 34:6,7) He also revealed that the \\"center place\\" of the City of Zion would be near the town of Independence in Jackson County. (D & C 57:3) Latter Day Saints began to settle the area to \\"build up\\" the City of Zion in 1831. Settlement was rapid and non-Mormon residents became alarmed that they might lose political control of the county to the Latter Day Saints. In October 1833, non-Mormon vigilantes succeeded in driving the Mormons from the county. Deprived of their homes and property, the Latter Day Saints temporarily settled in the area around Jackson County, especially in Clay County. Years elapsed, and despite Mormon lawsuits and petitions, the non-Mormons in Jackson refused to allow the Mormons to return. Meanwhile, new converts to Mormonism continued to migrate to Missouri and settle in Clay County. In 1836, the Missouri legislature created Caldwell County specifically for Mormon settlement and Missouri branches of the church gathered there, centering on the town of Far West. =Church headquarters established in Far West= In 1838 Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon and their loyalists left the former church headquarters of Kirtland and relocated to Far West, Missouri. A brief leadership struggle left the former heads of the Missouri portion of the church excommunicated, such as David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, William Wines Phelps and others. Years later, many of this group of \\"dissenters\\" became part of the Whitmerite schism in the Latter Day Saint movement. While the church was headquartered in Far West, Smith announced revelations that changed the name of the church to the \\"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\\" and initiated the \\"Law of Tithing.\\" Conflicts with non-Mormon settlers arose as the church began to plant colonies in the counties surrounding Caldwell. These escalated into what has been called the 1838 Mormon War. The perceived militant attitude adopted by the church caused some leaders, including Thomas B. Marsh, president of the Quorum of the Twelve, to break with Smith and Rigdon. This precipitated another schism which led to the foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ, the Bride, the Lamb's Wife by George M. Hinkle, who had been the Mormon commander of the Caldwell County militia. As a result of the war, 2,500 Missouri militia troops were called out to put down the Mormon \\"rebellion.\\" Smith and other church leaders were imprisoned in Liberty, Missouri and the majority of the Latter Day Saints were deprived of their property and expelled from the state. Movement in Illinois Joseph Smith marshalling the Nauvoo Legion With the help of sympathetic non-Mormons in Illinois, in the spring of 1839 the Latter Day Saint refugees regrouped and began to establish a new headquarters in Nauvoo. Smith and other leaders were allowed after several months of harsh treatment to escape Missourian custody, and they rejoined the main body of the movement in April, 1839. In 1841, construction began on a new temple, significantly more elaborate than the one left behind in Kirtland. The Nauvoo city charter authorized independent municipal courts, the foundation of a university and the establishment of a militia unit known as the \\"Nauvoo Legion.\\" These and other institutions gave the Latter Day Saints a considerable degree of autonomy. Nauvoo saw the final flowering of Joseph Smith's vision for the movement, including some of Mormonism's more controversial practices. It was here that Smith introduced Baptism for the dead, Rebaptism, the Nauvoo-era Endowment, and the ordinance of the Second Anointing. In addition, he created a new inner council of the church ‚Äî containing both men and women ‚Äî called the Anointed Quorum. Although, according to some reports, Smith himself had been secretly practicing what he later called plural marriage for some time, in Nauvoo he began to teach other leaders the doctrine. In March 1844, Smith was said by William Law to have organized a secret council of the church called the \\"Council of the Kingdom\\". Practices of this council included acclaiming Joseph Smith as \\"Prophet, Priest, and King\\" in addition to polygamy. These secrets were threatened to be released in a newspaper called the Nauvoo Expositor. Smith, acting in his capacity as mayor and head of the municipal court, responded by having the newspaper declared a \\"public nuisance\\" and by ordering the destruction of the press. Death of Joseph Smith Whenever Latter Day Saints gathered in large numbers, they met with opposition from neighbors who suspected that Mormon bloc-voting would lead to theocracy. By the mid-1840s, many non-Mormons in Hancock County felt threatened by growing Mormon political power, commercial rivalries, and a new religion with at least two elements that were hard to digest in the religious community of that time: first, Latter Day Saints had a somewhat different perspective on the nature of God from traditional Protestants; second, the claim of modern revelation, together with the claim of new scripture, opened the canon of the Bible. Smith's destruction of the Expositor exacerbated all these fears and non-Mormons throughout Illinois began to clamor for his arrest. When Smith submitted to imprisonment in the county seat of Carthage, the Governor of Illinois, Thomas Ford, left the jail, taking the only impartial local militia unit with him. With the jail being guarded only by two guards and a unit of anti-Mormon militiamen, the Carthage Greys, a mob of disbanded militia units, attacked without resistance. Joseph and his brother Hyrum were killed. All men who were tried for the murders were acquitted after the prosecuting attorney dismissed the testimonies of the state's witnesses suddenly in his closing remarks. Change in leadership=Succession Crisis of 1844 In the months following Smith's murder, it was not immediately clear who would lead the church. His brother, Hyrum, who was Assistant President of the Church, (and as such would have been Smith's natural successor) had died with him. Another Smith brother who may have been a presumed successor should both Hyrum and Joseph die, Samuel, died a month later. Before Brigham Young could return to Nauvoo and stake his claim, another Smith brother, William was also considered as a potential successor. Other men who (by some reports) were designated as successors, including Book of Mormon witnesses David Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery, had been excommunicated from the church. As a result, three of the principal claimants on the scene were: * Sidney Rigdon, the only remaining member of the First Presidency ‚Äî the church's highest executive council before his excommunication. * The (Presiding) High Council of Nauvoo ‚Äî the church's highest legislative and judicial council ‚Äî led by William Marks. * The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles ‚Äî the council in charge of the church's missionary program ‚Äî led by Brigham Young. Smith's widow, Emma, wanted Marks to become church president, but Marks believed that Rigdon had the superior claim. In a general meeting of the church at Nauvoo on August 8, 1844, Rigdon and Young presented their respective cases. As the only surviving member of the First Presidency (who had not officially apostatized), Rigdon argued that he should be made \\"guardian\\" of the church. Young argued that without Smith there, there was no presiding authority higher than the Twelve. Therefore, he proposed that the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles be constituted as the new presiding authority. A vote of the congregation overwhelmingly supported Young's proposal, said to have been caused by Brigham briefly yet miraculously having the \\"voice and countenance of Joseph Smith\\" during his talk. Soon after, Rigdon left Nauvoo and established his own church organization in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Rigdon, Young and Marks were later joined by a fourth claimant, James J. Strang of Voree, Wisconsin, who claimed that Smith had sent him a letter designating him as his successor. However, Strang had only recently joined the church, and lacked name-recognition among the rank-and-file Mormons in Nauvoo. Though he would manage to attract a sizable following, his assassination in 1856 all but extinguished his sect. Further schisms and the \\"Mormon War in Illinois\\" With Rigdon's flight, Young and most of the Twelve Apostles assumed control of church headquarters in Nauvoo. A conflict with Joseph Smith's last surviving brother, William, was a factor that led the remaining members of the Smith family to break with the Twelve. Many (though not all) initially followed Strang, though all later left Strang's organization and joined themselves to the nascent Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which coalesced in the early 1860s around Joseph Smith's eldest son, Joseph Smith III. Meanwhile, at Nauvoo, the conflict between Mormons and non-Mormons escalated into what is sometimes called the \\"Mormon War in Illinois.\\" Latter Day Saints in outlying areas were driven from their homes and gathered to Nauvoo for protection. The Illinois state legislature voted to revoke Nauvoo's charter and the city began to operate extra-legally. At about this time, Nauvoo's population peaked; it may have had as many as 12,000 inhabitants (and several nearly as large suburbs), rivaling Chicago, Illinois, whose 1845 population was about 15,000, and its suburbs. However, by the end of 1845, it became clear that no peace was possible, and Young and the Twelve negotiated a truce so that the Latter Day Saints could prepare to abandon the city. The winter of 1845-46 saw the enormous preparations for the Mormon Exodus across the Great Plains. Major divisions The largest group of Latter Day Saints followed nine of the Twelve Apostles west, establishing a way station at Winter Quarters, Nebraska in 1846, and entering Salt Lake Valley in 1847. Having planted this initial colony in the Great Basin, Young returned to Winter Quarters and in December 1847 reorganized his faction of the church, establishing himself as the head of a new First Presidency. This reorganization led to additional schisms, including the break with Alpheus Cutler and what became the Church of Christ (Cutlerite) as well as Lyman Wight's group in Zodiac, Texas. Young's organization today, the LDS Church, is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. (See History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.) The bulk of Sidney Rigdon's church had dissolved by 1847, but some loyalists reorganized as The Church of Jesus Christ under the leadership of William Bickerton in 1862. James J. Strang's church in Voree suffered a significant schism in 1849, led by former follower Aaron Smith. After Strang's 1856 assassination, much of the remaining membership fell away from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), but a small following remained loyal. Other leaders, including David Whitmer, James Collin Brewster, James Emmett, Gladden Bishop, William Smith, and Charles B. Thompson also established church organizations that had limited followings. Joseph Smith's family ‚Äî including his widow, Emma Hale Smith, and her children ‚Äî continued to live in Nauvoo after the departure of the majority of the Latter Day Saints. In 1860, the eldest of the Smith sons, Joseph Smith III, said he received a revelation to take his place as Prophet/President of a \\"New Organization\\" of the Latter Day Saint church. This group had gathered together many of the remnants of the various Midwestern Latter Day Saint groups into the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, now called the Community of Christ. This has continued to be the second largest Latter Day Saint group, with headquarters on a portion of the original Temple Lot in Independence, Missouri. Others remained unaffiliated, however, and in 1863 a group of Latter Day Saints from Illinois and Indiana united under the leadership of Granville Hedrick and reclaimed the name of the movement's original organization, the \\"Church of Christ.\\" This group was the first group of Latter Day Saints to return to Independence, Missouri, to \\"redeem Zion.\\" They are now headquartered on portion of the original Temple Lot there and are known as the Church of Christ (Temple Lot). The Latter Day Saint movement today=Denominations While it would be impractical to include an in-depth discussion of every church in the Latter Day Saint movement, the two largest and most prominent sects are included here, together with a brief listing of some of the more prominent smaller sects. =The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints= By far the largest of the sects, with membership in the millions, the LDS Church continues to be led by Brigham Young's successors. Young reorganized the First Presidency in 1847, and the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have continued the same succession pattern: when the Prophet dies, the senior Apostle becomes the head of the LDS Church. As of January 2018, Russell M. Nelson is the church president. Among other things, the LDS Church has become known for its proselyting and humanitarian work worldwide. =Community of Christ= The Community of Christ, known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS) until 2001, is the second largest group, with over 250,000 members. Joseph Smith's descendants continued to serve as Prophet and President until the retirement of Wallace B. Smith in the early twenty-first century. Today the church is led by President/Prophet Stephen M. Veazey, who is no relation to Joseph Smith. While the Community of Christ is somewhat more in line doctrinally with mainline Protestantism, they also believe in the Book of Mormon and an open scriptural canon, and place great emphasis upon peacemaking and similar pursuits. The Community of Christ has ordained women to priesthood since 1985 and dedicated a temple in Independence, Mo., in 1994. =Minor factions= Other notable minor factions of the Latter Day Saint movement include: the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), which owns the Temple Lot in Independence, Missouri; the Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite), founded by a member of Joseph Smith's Council of Fifty; the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), founded by James J. Strang in 1844; the Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), founded by a follower of Sidney Rigdon in the early 1860s (and now the third-largest Latter Day Saint denomination); the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, founded in the 1940s by a man who claimed to be receiving revelations from John the Baptist; and the Restoration Branches, which broke with the Community of Christ in 1984 when that church began ordaining women. In addition, several other Latter Day Saint factions continue to exist, some of which still practice polygamy. Important beliefsJesus Christ= Latter Day Saints share a central belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. They accept his sacrifice as the only way to be saved. According to this movement's theology, that is the central message of the scriptures. =Revelation and scripture= Latter Day Saints generally share an open canon. While different sects believe in different revelations, a central theme of the Latter Day Saint movement is that God always has more to say to the church, because the church's situation is always changing. Latter Day Saints believe in the Bible and other ancient scripture. However, the modern prophet is usually considered to be a more important source of revelation, because he receives contemporary (and, thus, more relevant) instructions from God. =Priesthood authority= Most Latter Day Saint sects believe that authority from Jesus Christ is necessary in order to baptize, give the gift of the Holy Ghost, or administer the Lord's Supper (or the sacrament). This Priesthood authority can be traced to the day that Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery received the Melchizedek Priesthood from Peter, James, and John, who received the Priesthood from Jesus himself. =Zion= Many of Joseph Smith's early revelations prophesied that the Latter Day Saints would build Zion, a new Jerusalem, a religious utopia centered in Jackson County, MO. The Prophet urged his followers to give everything they had to this cause. However, when they failed to live the Law of Consecration, which was a promise to voluntarily give all their property to the community for equal distribution, Joseph Smith received a revelation that God would build Zion later, when the people were ready. Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church have come to understand Zion as primarily a community way of life that is centered around Jesus Christ, but many people still believe that, when they are ready, they will be able to build the literal city of Zion as well.

As a writer, he became friends with screenwriter and future co-star Rub√©n Aguirre. Aguirre was hired by Chespirito (Roberto G√≥mez Bola√±os) to play Professor Jirafales in the then upcoming El Chavo del Ocho Televisa television series. Aguirre held a party for family and friends at his house, and Villagr√°n impressed him after expanding his cheeks out of proportion during one of the party's comic steps. As a matter of a fact, that movement would later become a trademark of the character he'd play in El Chavo. Aguirre recommended Villagr√°n to Chespirito, and Villagr√°n was given the Quico character in the show. He also appeared on Chespirito's other hit show, El Chapul√≠n Colorado. Both of Chespirito's shows became major international hits all over Iberoamerica, Spain, the United States and other countries. Villagr√°n acquired great fame with these shows. Villagr√°n left the shows in 1978, mostly because he and Chespirito were engaged in a legal battle over the rights of the Quico character. At that same time, Ram√≥n Vald√©s also left the two shows. This marked the beginning of the end for both productions, although they are still seen on many countries around the world with re-runs. Villagr√°n went to Venezuela, where he acted in various Radio Caracas Televisi√≥n shows: El ni√±o de papel (1981), Kiko Botones (1981), Federrico (1982), Las nuevas aventuras de Federrico (1983), and El circo de monsieur Cachet√≥n (1985). These were not successful as Chespirito's productions had been in Mexico. He and Vald√©s were reunited in Mexico when Telerey hired them to make the short-lived television show Ah que Kiko!. Chespirito was not able to prevent the name Kiko, with its different spelling, from being used in the new show. The show was successful until Vald√©s died of stomach cancer in 1988. For a brief time a local comic Sergio Ramos was brought in as Don Cejudo, but the chemistry was no longer there, so the show soon was taken off the air. Like many of his co-stars in the Chespirito shows, Villagr√°n went on to enjoy a circus career, touring with his El circo de Kiko. Villagr√°n later did what his friend Aguirre had done before, moving to Argentina, where Chespirito had no rights over the Quico character, and playing his old character there. In 2000, in an El Chavo del Ocho special which reunited all the actors from the series (except Ram√≥n Vald√©s, Angelines Fern√°ndez, Ra√∫l Padilla, Horacio G√≥mez Bola√±os, and Ana Lilian de la Macorra, who was not present), Villagr√°n and Chespirito reconciled their differences. In 2017, the Brazilian movie \\"Como se Tornar o Pior Aluno da Escola\\" (literally translated: \\"How to become the worst student in the school\\") is announced, which was released in October in the same year and with Carlos Villagr√°n in the role of Ademar, the director of the school and antagonist of the film. It was based on the eponymous book by comedian and Brazilian TV presenter Danilo Gentili. Personal life Villagr√°n has three sons and three daughters.

The contract was awarded to Thales in March 2003. The goal The goal is to integrate a modular system of all equipment, weapons and their sighting systems, radios that the individual soldier carries or uses, in order to increase their overall effectiveness on the battlefield. The programme is being managed by the Dismounted Close Combat Integrated Project Team at Defence Equipment and Support, MoD Abbey Wood in Bristol. Subsystems A major complement of the FIST project is the Bowman communications system, which gives secure communications to the troops on the ground, allowing for simultaneous transmission of voice and data and having built-in GPS equipment, as well as sending visual information direct from personal cameras. The kit is aimed to cover 5 main areas: * Command and Control * Lethality * Mobility * Survivability * Sustainability Command and Control is aimed to improve fire team and local commanders' awareness of the situation. Lethality is as the name suggests and includes new weapon systems such as the new NLAW and Javelin anti tank weapons and the new sights for the SA80. Mobility includes areas such as route planning and GPS locations, survivability includes armour and stealth and sustainability includes areas such as power supplies with the system aiming to run off new next generation power cells. The Surveillance and Target Acquisition (STA) element of FIST was contracted to Thales to deliver a range of sights, target locators, periscopes and digital cameras in 2010-14 at a cost of ¬£150 million. They equip nearly 11,000 troops from all 3 services. Timescales The project aimed to deploy a whole suite of digitized weapon platforms by 2008. First major trials of the FIST system were completed on Salisbury Plain in January, 2005. In these trials at the Salisbury Plain training area. 70 soldiers were equipped with the prototype FIST technology including GPS, communications and weapon sights and compared to the effectiveness of 70 conventionally equipped soldiers. A further FIST V2 trial was scheduled for 2006. 35,000 sets of kit are expected to be bought and issued between 2015 and 2020. This equipment is designed to bring the British infantryman up to standards and link with new technology currently employed, including the new underslung grenade launcher for the SA80 and the deployed Bowman communications network. It is not intended that every soldier be equipped with FIST: instead unit commanders will request FIST kits as necessary and so they can be tailored to the situation and mission aims. As well as linking into the new technology for the soldier it is designed to link in with other communications systems as well as the UK UAV project called Watchkeeper. Dismounted Situational Awareness As of 2016, the MoD publicised plans to replace the existing Bowman with a system named Morpheus. Morpheus will deliver the next generation of Tactical Communication and Information Systems (TacCIS) capability. It will address critical system obsolescence and introduce a more agile TacCIS solution (both technical and business).. The element of Morpheus that handles communications for the infantry soldier is known as Dismounted Situational Awareness (DSA).

Their father, William Marshall Smart, was John Couch Adams Astronomer at Cambridge University and later Regius Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow. In 1950, W. M. Smart was President of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1946, Jack Smart graduated from the University of Glasgow with an MA, followed by a BPhil from Oxford University in 1948. He then worked as a Junior Research Fellow at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, for two years. He arrived in Australia in August 1950 to take up the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Adelaide, which he occupied from 1950 until 1972. After twenty-two years in Adelaide, he moved to La Trobe University where he was Reader in Philosophy from 1972 to 1976. He then moved to the Australian National University where he was Professor of Philosophy in the Research School of Social Sciences from 1976 until his retirement in 1985, and where the annual Jack Smart Lecture is held in his honour. Following his retirement he was Emeritus Professor at Monash University. Smart was a Foundation Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities at its establishment in 1969. In 1990 he was awarded the Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia.Monash University Website In 1991 he was elected to become an honorary Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and in 2010, elected to become an honorary Fellow of Queen's College, Oxford. At first Smart was a behaviourist before becoming an early proponent of type identity theory.The Identity Theory of Mind (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) Metaphysics Smart's main contribution to metaphysics is in the area of philosophy of time. He has been an influential defender of the B-theory of time, and of perdurantism. His most important original arguments in this area concern the passage of time, which he claimed is an illusion. He argued that if time really passed, then it would make sense to ask at what rate it passes, but this requires some second time-dimension with respect to which passage of normal time can be measured. This in turn faces the same problems, and so there must be a third time-dimension, and so on. This is called the rate of passage argument and it was originally put forward by C. D. Broad.J. J. C. Smart, \\"The river of time\\", Mind 58 (232):483‚Äì494 (1949).Ned Markosian, \\"How fast does time pass?\\", Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 53(4):829‚Äì844 (1993). Smart has changed his mind about the nature and causes of the illusion of the passage of time. In the 1950s, he held that it was due to people's use of anthropocentric temporal language. He later came to abandon this linguistic explanation of the illusion in favour of a psychological explanation in terms of the passage of memories from short-term to long-term memory. Philosophy of mind Regarding the philosophy of mind, Smart was a physicalist. In the 1950s, he was also one of the originators, with Ullin Place, of the mind‚Äìbrain identity theory, which claims that particular states of mind are identical with particular states of the brain. Initially, this view was dubbed \\"Australian materialism\\" by its detractors, in reference to the stereotype of Australians as down-to-earth and unsophisticated. Smart's identity theory dealt with some extremely long- standing objections to physicalism by comparing the mind‚Äìbrain identity thesis to other identity theses well-known from science, such as the thesis that lightning is an electrical discharge, or that the morning star is the evening star. Although these identity theses give rise to puzzles such as Gottlob Frege's puzzle of the Morning Star and Evening Star, in the scientific cases, some claim that it would be absurd to reject the identity theses on this ground. Since the puzzles facing physicalism are strictly analogous to the scientific identity theses, it would then also be absurd to reject physicalism on the grounds that it gives rise to these puzzles. Ethics In ethics, Smart was a defender of utilitarianism. Specifically, he defended \\"extreme\\", or act utilitarianism, as opposed to \\"restricted\\", or rule utilitarianism. The distinction between these two types of ethical theory is explained in his essay Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism.J.J.C. Smart, \\"Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism\\", The Philosophical Quarterly, Oct. 1956, pages 344‚Äì354, based on a paper read to the Victorian Branch of the Australasian Association of Psychology and philosophy, Oct. 1955. Smart later stated that he made mistakes in this essay (for example, that probably maximizing benefit is not the same thing as maximizing probable benefit). However, perhaps because of this very fact, that is, perhaps because Smart did not fall prey to what might be called the \\"philosopher's disease\\" of attempting to be obsessively precise, this essay lays out a good clear, readable presentation of act utilitarianism. Smart gave two arguments against rule utilitarianism. According to the first, rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism because there is no adequate criterion on what can count as a \\"rule\\". According to the second, even if there were such a criterion, the rule utilitarian would be committed to the untenable position of preferring to follow a rule, even if it would be better if the rule were broken, which Smart called \\"superstitious rule worship\\".J.J.C. Smart, \\"Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism\\", The Philosophical Quarterly, Oct. 1956, pages 344‚Äì354, based on a paper read to the Victorian Branch of the Australasian Association of Psychology and philosophy, Oct. 1955. Smart's views on rule utilitarianism have been challenged, for example by Alan Gibbard Another aspect of Smart's ethical theory is his acceptance of a preference theory of well-being, which contrasts with the hedonism associated with \\"classical\\" utilitarians such as Jeremy Bentham. Smart's combination of the preference theory with consequentialism is sometimes called \\"preference utilitarianism\\". Smart's arguments against rule utilitarianism have been very influential, contributing to a steady decline in its popularity among ethicists during the late 20th century. Worldwide, his defence of act utilitarianism and preference theory has been less prominent but has influenced philosophers who have worked or been educated in Australia, such as Frank Jackson, Philip Pettit, and Peter Singer. One of Smart's two entries in the Philosophical Lexicon refers to his approach to the consequences of act utilitarianism: to \\"outsmart\\" an opponent is \\"to embrace the conclusion of one's opponent's reductio ad absurdum argument.\\" This move is more commonly called \\"biting the bullet\\".

It is now a Radisson hotel. The hall was built to commemorate the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The architect was Edward Walters. The hall was owned by the Manchester Corporation. It was bombed in the Manchester Blitz; its interior was rebuilt and was Manchester's premier concert venue until the construction of the Bridgewater Hall in 1996. The hall was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1963. History The Free Trade Hall was built as a public hall between 1853 and 1856 by Edward Walters on land given by Richard Cobden in St Peter's Fields, the site of the Peterloo Massacre. Two earlier halls had been constructed on the site, the first, a large timber pavilion was built in 1840, and its brick replacement built in 1842. The halls were \\"vital to Manchester's considerable role in the long campaign for the repeal of the Corn Laws. The hall was funded by public subscription and became a concert hall and home of the Hall√© Orchestra in 1858. A red plaque records that it was built on the site of the Peterloo Massacre in 1819. The Free Trade Hall was bought by Manchester Corporation in 1920; but was bombed and left an empty shell in the Manchester Blitz of December 1940. A new hall was constructed behind two walls of the original facade in 1950‚Äì51 by Manchester City Council's architect, L. C. Howitt. opening as a concert hall in 1951. As well as housing the Hall√© Orchestra, it was used for pop and rock concerts. A Wurlitzer organ from the Paramount Cinema in Manchester was installed over four years and first used in public in a BBC programme broadcast in September 1977. When the hall closed, the organ, which was on loan, was moved to the great hall in Stockport Town Hall. The Hall√© Orchestra moved to the Bridgewater Hall in 1996 and the Free Trade Hall was closed by Manchester City Council. In 1997 the building was sold to private developers despite resistance from groups such as the Manchester Civic Society, who viewed the sale as inappropriate given the historical significance of the building and its site. After the initial planning application was refused by the Secretary of State, a second modified planning application was submitted and approved. Walters' original facade was retained, behind which architects Stephenson Bell designed a 263-bedroom hotel, demolishing Howitt's post-war hall but preserving the main staircase and the 1950s statues that were formerly attached to its rear wall. The hotel opened in 2004, having cost ¬£45 million. Architecture The fa√ßade of the Free Trade Hall The Italian palazzo-style hall was built on a trapeziform site in ashlar sandstone. It has a two-storey, nine-bay facade and concealed roof. On Peter Street, its ground floor arcade has rectangular piers with round-headed arches and spandrels bearing the coats of arms of Lancashire towns that took part in the Anti-Corn Law movement. The upper floor has a colonnaded arcade, its tympana frieze is richly decorated with carved figures representing free trade, the arts, commerce, manufacture and the continents. Above the tympanum is a prominent cornice with balustraded parapet. The upper floor has paired Ionic columns to each bay and a tall window with a pedimented architrave behind a balustraded balcony. The return sides have three bays in a matching but simpler style of blank arches. The rear wall was rebuilt in 1950‚Äì51 with pilasters surmounted by relief figures representing the entertainment which took place in the old hall. The Large Hall was in a classical style with a coffered ceiling, the walls had wood panelling in oak, walnut and sycamore. Pevsner described it as \\"the noblest monument in the Cinquecento style in England\\", whilst Hartwell considered it \\"a classic which belongs in the canon of historic English architecture.\\" After its closure, the hall was sold and after a protracted planning process and consultations with English Heritage, its conversion to a hotel was agreed. During the hotel's construction, the Windmill Street and Southmill Street facades were demolished and the north block retained and connected by a triangular glazed atrium to a 15-storey block clad in stone and glass. Artifacts salvaged from the old hall, including 1950s statues by Arthur Sherwood Edwards and framed wall plaster autographed by past performers, decorate the atrium light well. Events A commemorative plaque on the side of the Manchester Free Trade Hall The Free Trade Hall was a venue for public meetings and political speeches and a concert hall. Charles Dickens performed here in the summer of 1857 in Wilkie Collins's play The Frozen Deep. In 1872 Benjamin Disraeli gave his One Nation speech. In 1904, Winston Churchill delivered a speech at the hall defending Britain's policy of free trade. The Times called it \\"one of the most powerful and brilliant he has made.\\" In 1905 the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) activists, Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney were ejected from a meeting addressed by the Liberal politician Sir Edward Grey, who repeatedly refused to answer their question on Votes for Women. Christabel Pankhurst immediately began an impromptu meeting outside, and when the police moved them on, contrived to be arrested and brought to court. So began the militant WSPU campaign for the vote. After Sir Charles Hall√© founded the Hall√© Orchestra in 1858, its home was the Free Trade Hall until the hall was damaged in the Manchester Blitz. The Hall√© performed at the reopening in 1951 with the Orchestra's musical director and conductor, Sir John Barbirolli who remained until 1970. The final concert there was in 1996. Kathleen Ferrier sang at the re-opening of the Free Trade Hall in 1951, ending with a performance of Elgar's \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", the only performance of that piece in her career. Bob Dylan played here in 1965, and again in 1966, the occasion of the \\"Judas!\\" shout. In the late 60s Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, The Moody Blues, Tyrannosaurus Rex, (Marc Bolan) and The Dubliners played there amongst others. Pink Floyd played on five occasions as did Genesis on 30 January 1971 (during the Six Bob Tour together with Lindisfarne and Van der Graaf Generator) as well as in February 1973. On 4 June 1976, the Lesser Free Trade Hall was the venue for a concert by the Sex Pistols at the start of the punk rock movement. This concert would prove influential as it inspired bands such as Joy Division, The Smiths and The Fall.

A challenge is usually made by players calling out the name of the game, and the loser of a challenge has to pick up every card played so far. Cheat is classed as a party game. As with many card games, cheat has an oral tradition and so people are taught the game under different names. The game is called \\"I Doubt It\\" by Edmond HoyleHoyle's Rules of Games, Albert Morehead and is commonly known as \\"Cheat\\" in Britain and \\"Bullshit\\" in the United States.  Rules of playing Cheat  One pack of 52 cards is used for four or fewer players; five or more players should combine two 52-card packs. Shuffle the cards and deal them as evenly as possible among the players. No cards should be left. Some players may end up with one card more or less than other players. Players may look at their hands. A player's turn consists of discarding one or more cards face down, and calling out their rank - which may be a lie. The player who sits to the left of the dealer (clockwise) takes the first turn, and must call aces. The second player does the same, and must call twos. Play continues like this, increasing rank each time, with aces following kings. If any player thinks another player is lying, they can call the player out by shouting \\"Cheat\\" (or \\"Bluff,\\" \\"I doubt it,\\" etc.), and the cards in question are revealed to all players. If the accused player was indeed lying, they have to take the whole pile of cards into their hand. If the player was not lying, the caller must take the pile into their hand. Once the next player has placed cards, however, it is too late to call out any previous players. The game ends when any player runs out of cards, at which point they win.  Variants  *A common British variant allows a player to pass their turn if they don‚Äôt wish to lie or if all the cards of the required rank have clearly been previously played. * Some variants allow a rank above or below the previous rank to be called. Others allow the current rank to be repeated or progress down through ranks instead of up. * Some variants allow only a single card to be discarded during a turn. * In some variations a player may also lie about the number of cards they are playing, if they feel confident that other players will not notice the discrepancy. This is challenged and revealed in the usual manner. * In another variant, players must continue placing cards of the same rank until someone calls \\"Cheat\\" or everyone decides to pass a turn.  International variants = Mogeln  The German and Austrian variant is for four or more players and is variously known as Mogeln (\\"cheat\\"), Schwindeln (\\"swindle\\"), L√ºgen (\\"lie\\") or Zweifeln (\\"doubting\\"). A 52-card pack is used (two packs with more players) and each player is dealt the same number of cards, any surplus being dealt face down to the table. The player who has the Ace of Hearts leads by placing it face down on the table (on the surplus cards if any). The player to the left follows and names his discard as the Two of Hearts and so on up to the King. Then the next suit is started. Any player may play a card other than the correct one in the sequence, but if his opponents suspect him of cheating, they call gemogelt! (\\"cheated!\\"). The card is checked and if it is the wrong card, the offending player has to pick up the entire stack. If it is the right card, the challenger has to pick up the stack. The winner is the first to shed all their cards; the loser is the last one left holding any cards. Verish' Ne Verish' The Russian game Verish' Ne Verish' (\\"Trust, don't trust\\") - described by David Parlett as \\"an ingenious cross between Cheat and Old Maid\\" \\\\- is also known as Russian Bluff, Chinese Bluff or simply as Cheat. The game is played with 36 cards (two or three player) or 52 (four or more). One card is removed at random before the game and set aside face-down, and the remainder are dealt between players (even if this results in players having differently sized hands of cards). The core of the game is played in the same manner as Cheat, except that the rank does not change as play proceeds around the table: every player must call the same rank. Whenever players pick up cards due to a bluff being called, they may ‚Äì if they wish ‚Äì reveal four of the same rank from their hand, and discard them. In some variants, if the player does not have any of the rank in their hand, they may call \\"skip\\" or \\"pass\\" and the next player takes their turn. If every player passes, the cards on the table are removed from the game, and the last player begins the next round. Canadian/Spanish Bluff Similar to Russian Bluff, it is a version used by at least some in Canada and known in Spain. The rules are rather strict and, while a variation, is not open to much variation. It is also known in English as Fourshit (single deck) and Eightshit (double deck), the game involves a few important changes to the standard rules. Usually two decks are used instead of one so that there are 8 of every card as well as four jokers (Jokers are optional), though one deck may be used if desired. Not all ranks are used; the players can arbitrarily choose which ranks to use in the deck and, if using two decks, should use one card for each player plus two or three more. Four players may choose to use 6,8,10,J,Q,K,A or may just as easily choose 2,4,5,6,7,9,J,K, or any other cards. This can be a useful way to make use of decks with missing cards as those ranks can be removed. The four jokers are considered wild and may represent any card in the game. The first player can be chosen by any means. The Spanish variation calls for a bidding war to see who has the most of the highest card. The winner of the challenge is the first player. In Canada, a version is the first player to be dealt a Jack face up, and then the cards are re dealt face down. The first player will make a \\"claim\\" of any rank of cards and an amount of their choice. In this version each player in turn must play as many cards as they wish of the same rank. The rank played never goes up, down nor changes in any way. If the first player plays kings, all subsequent players must also play kings for that round (it is non-incremental). Jokers represent the card of the rank being played in each round, and allow a legal claim of up to 11 of one card (seven naturals and four jokers). A player may play more cards than they claim to play though hiding cards under the table or up the sleeve is not allowed. After any challenge, the winner begins a new round by making a claim of any amount of any card rank. If at any point a player picks up cards and has all eight natural cards of a certain rank, he declares this out loud and removes them from the game. If a player fails to do this and later leads a round with this rank, he or she automatically loses the game. Once a player has played all his or her cards, he or she is out of that particular hand. Play continues until there are only two players (at which point some cards have probably been removed from the game). The players continue playing until there is a loser. The object of the game is not so much to win, but not be the loser. The loser is usually penalised by the winners either in having the dishonour of losing, or having to perform a forfeit. China In the Fujian province, a version of the game known as ÂêπÁâõ (\\"bragging\\") or ËØ¥Ë∞é (\\"lying\\") is played with no restriction on the rank that may be called each turn, and simply requiring that each set is claimed to be of the same number. This makes it possible for a player to play out their entire hand without lying. This version is usually played with several decks shuffled together, allowing players to play (or claim to play) large numbers of cards of the same rank. Sweden Known as bluffstopp (a portmanteau of bluff (\\"bluff\\") and stoppspel (\\"shedding game\\".)) Players are given six (or seven) cards at the start of the game, and the remainder makes a pile. Players are restricted to follow suit, and play a higher rank, but are allowed to bluff. If a player is revealed to be bluffing, or a player fails to call or a bluff, the player draws three cards from the pile. Additional rules and players to play more than one card in secret, and drop cards in their lap. But if this is discovered, the player must draw three or even six cards.

It has a complex history, and is now a subsidiary title to the marquessate of Salisbury. Background The title was first created for Patrick de Salisbury in the middle twelfth century. In 1196 the title passed to Patrick‚Äôs granddaughter, Ela, who married William Longesp√©e, an illegitimate son of Henry II the same year. Ela was predeceased by husband and son, and was succeeded by her granddaughter, Margaret Longesp√©e. Margaret married Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln, and their daughter Alice eventually became Countess of Salisbury, in 1310, and of Lincoln, in 1311. Alice had married Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, in 1294. When the Earl of Lancaster, but when he lost his titles and was executed for treason in 1322, the Countess surrendered all of her titles to the King, and the titles lapsed. The title was created for a second time in 1337 for William Montacute of the noble House of Montagu. This line ended in the sole heiress, Alice Montacute, and her husband Richard Neville took up the earldom 'by right of his wife'.Complete Peerage records (XI, p. 395, note (o)) that Parliament agreed to this until the king came of age. The question then is whether this was or was not a creation of a new line. Complete Peerage did not think so and treated all earls up to and including Margaret Plantagenet as part of the one line created in 1337. Certainly the earldom was inherited later by Richard Neville the Kingmaker, upon whose death the title went into abeyance because multiple individuals were entitled to inherit it. However in those days the modern doctrine of abeyance had not been formulated, certainly on Richard the Kingmaker's death there were only his two daughters and daughters were always regarded as equal in status unlike sons where the first son was always first in status and inheritance; so without a Royal initiative it was impossible to say to which daughter the title should go, not to mention that Richard earl of Warwick and Salisbury had been in rebellion against the sovereign and died in battle.Complete Peerage vol XI, pp.395-399 After Warwick's death at the Battle of Barnet, in 1471 , the title was granted in 1472 to George, Duke of Clarence, who was married to Warwick's eldest daughter. When the Duke of Clarence was executed in 1478 for treason (supposedly by being drowned in a vat of Malmsey wine), the title was forfeit. It was then granted to Edward of Middleham (who was his nephew via the Duke's brother Richard), who died in 1484 at the age of 11. It was restored to two of George of Clarence's children: to his son Edward in 1485 until his execution for treason in 1499, and to Edward's sister, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, in 1513 until she was also executed, and the title again forfeited, in 1539. In 1605 the title was given to Robert Cecil, a close advisor to James I.

The Brudenell family descends from Sir Robert Brudenell, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas from 1520 to 1530. His great-grandson, Sir Thomas Brudenell, was created a Baronet in the Baronetage of England, styled \\"of Deene in the County of Northampton\\", on 29 June 1611.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage 1900 On 26 February 1628, he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Brudenell, of Stanton Wyvill in the County of Leicester, and on 20 April 1661 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Cardigan, also in the Peerage of England. On his death, the titles passed to his son, Robert, the 2nd Earl, and on the 2nd Earl's death to his grandson, George, the 3rd Earl, the 2nd Earl's only son, Francis, Lord Brudenell, having predeceased his father. The 3rd Earl's eldest son George, the 4th Earl, married Lady Mary Montagu, daughter of John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, and succeeded to the Montagu estates on his father-in-law's death in 1749, including the Lordship of Bowland. He assumed the same year by Royal licence the surname of Montagu in lieu of Brudenell. In 1766, he was created Marquess of Monthermer and Duke of Montagu in the Peerage of Great Britain, revivals of the titles which had become extinct on his father-in-law's death in 1749. Montagu's only son and heir, John Montagu, Marquess of Monthermer, had already been created Baron Montagu, of Boughton in the County of Northampton, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1762, a revival of another title held by his maternal grandfather. However, Lord Monthermer died childless in 1770, predeceasing his father. The barony of Montagu died with him. In 1786, the Duke of Montagu was also created Baron Montagu, of Boughton in the County of Northampton, in the Peerage of Great Britain, with remainder to the younger sons of his daughter, Lady Elizabeth Montagu, wife of Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch. On the Duke's death in 1780, the marquessate and dukedom became extinct while he was succeeded in the barony of Montagu according to the special remainder by his grandson, Henry Scott (see Baron Montagu of Boughton for further history of this title; see also Duke of Montagu). The earldom, barony of Brudenell and baronetcy passed to the Duke's younger brother, James, the 5th Earl, who already on 17 October 1780 had been created Baron Brudenell, of Deene in the County of Northampton, in the Peerage of Great Britain, in his own right. However, he died childless in 1811 when the barony of 1780 became extinct. He was succeeded in the remaining titles by his nephew, Robert, the 6th Earl, only son of the Honourable Robert Brudenell, third son of the 3rd Earl. The 6th Earl's only son, James, 7th Earl, gained fame for his role in the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War. He was childless and on his death in 1868 the titles were inherited by his second cousin, George, 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury, grandson of Thomas Brudenell, the fourth and youngest son of the 3rd Earl. Thomas had succeeded his maternal uncle, the 3rd Earl of Ailesbury and 4th Earl of Elgin, in 1747 as Baron Bruce, of Tottenham in the County of Wilts, had in 1766 assumed the surname \\"Brudenell-Bruce\\", and had in 1776 been created Earl of Ailesbury in the Peerage of Great Britain. The 1st Earl of Ailesbury was succeeded by his son, Charles, the 2nd Earl of Ailesbury, who in 1821 had been created Viscount Savernake, of Savernake Forest in the County of Wilts, Earl Bruce, of Whorlton in the County of York, and Marquess of Ailesbury, in the County of Buckingham. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury and 8th Earl of Cardigan. For further history of the titles, see Marquess of Ailesbury. The Earldom remains united with the Marquessate of Ailesbury; and indeed, since the descendants of the 1st Earl of Ailesbury are the only remaining descendants of the 1st Earl of Cardigan, the titles will never be separated. The Earldom remains visible, however, as it is used as a courtesy title by the heirs apparent to the Marquessate. The family seat Deene Park was not united with the marquessate but was passed down to Commodore Lord Robert Thomas Brudenell-Bruce, second surviving son of the 3rd Marquess. Lord Robert's son George inherited the family seat along with the family's remaining estates in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire and reverted the family name back to \\"Brudenell\\" by Royal Licence.

It was re-created for his elder brother Thomas de Mowbray in the same year, however. This branch of the family became Dukes of Norfolk, and the title would descend with them until John de Mowbray died without male heirs in 1476. The third creation was for Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, son of Edward IV and one of the Princes in the Tower. Richard was imprisoned by his uncle Richard III (then Lord Protector), disappearing shortly after, presumed murdered. The earldom was briefly recreated in 1483 for the 4th time for William Berkeley, who later became Marquess of Berkeley. Then in 1525, the earldom was recreated for the 5th time for Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond and Somerset and illegitimate son of Henry VIII. Both died childless within ten years of being granted the title. The sixth creation was for Charles Howard, Lord High Admiral for Elizabeth I and James VI and I. He was commander of the English navy against the Spanish Armada, and a notable statesman in both reigns. His descendants held the earldom until 1681.

The six-county North Coast AVA overlaps with the Wine Country as defined here. In addition, the names of the counties themselves are legal for use as appellation names. History The earliest prehistory of the Wine Country involves habitation by several Native American tribes from approximately 8000 BC.Stewart, Suzanne B., Time before Time: Prehistory and Archaeology in the Lake Sonoma Area. Sacramento, CA: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1985. The principal tribes living in this region included the Pomo, Coast Miwok, Wappo and Patwin, whose early peoples practiced certain forms of agriculture, but probably not involving the cultivation of grapes. During the Mexican Colonial period and after, European settlers brought in more intensive agriculture to the Wine Country, including growing grapes and wine production. Some of the historical events that led to the establishment of California as a state transpired in the Wine Country. In particular, the town of Sonoma, is known as the birthplace of American California. Agoston Haraszthy is credited with being one of the forefathers of the California wine industry in Sonoma by his planting of grapes in the lower Arroyo Seco Creek watershed of Sonoma County.Charles Sullivan, Zinfandel: A History of a Grape and Its Wine, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 2003. In 2017, many portions of California's Wine Country were heavily devastated by wildfires, including the October 2017 Northern California wildfires.

Winter-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tsawytscha), Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are the most prominent fishes. Researchers have studied anadromous fish-movements extensively in Sonoma Creek and in the Napa River as well as in the Laguna de Santa Rosa - not only in the mainstems, but in many of the tributaries. These investigations have demonstrated a historical decline in spawning and habitat value for these species, primarily due to sedimentationSonoma Creek Watershed Limiting Factors Analysis, Sonoma Ecology Center, with support from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, December 2004. and secondarily to removal of riparian vegetation since the 19th century.

In 1975 there were only 25 Napa Valley wineries; today there are well over 800 wineries in Napa and Sonoma Counties. Tourists come to the region not only for wine tasting, but also for hiking, bicycling, hot air ballooning, and historic sites, as well as the extensive culinary choices. Numerous notable chefs and restaurateurs are present in the Wine Country, including Thomas Keller, John Ash, and Sondra Bernstein. Besides the obvious winery attractions, the Wine Country is known for the Sonoma County coastline along the Pacific Ocean, the Russian River valley, redwoods, hot spring baths, petrified forests and other natural areas. The Wine Country tourism boom has its downside, exemplified by traffic congestion on State Route 29, particularly on summer weekends, when the number of tourists often exceeds the carrying capacity of the road. The Napa Valley is also experiencing pressures for increased urbanization and roadway upgrading.Trancas Road/California State Route 29 Intersection Improvements There have also been issues related to regulating home sharing. After a boom in residents renting rooms in private homes, the city government of Napa was forced to require any Napa Airbnb properties to register.

In 1916, the company was reorganized as the A.C. Gilbert Company. The brand continued its independent existence under various corporate ownerships until 2000, when Meccano bought the Erector brand and consolidated its worldwide marketing with its own brand. The coverage here focuses on the historical legacy of the classic Erector Set; for current developments under the \\"Erector by Meccano\\" brand name, see the Meccano article. Basic Erector parts included various metal beams with regularly spaced holes for assembly using nuts and bolts. A frequently promoted patented feature was the ability to fabricate a strong but lightweight hollow structural girder from four long flat pieces of stamped sheet steel, held together by bolts and nuts (US Patent 1,066,809). Flat or curved pieces of sheet metal in various shapes and colors could be added to the structural skeleton. Hardened steel rods and screw clamps allowed the construction of hinges and the transmission of mechanical power via rotating parts such as pulleys, gears, wheels, and levers. Unlike some earlier wooden construction sets, Erector could be used both for static structures and for dynamic structures incorporating mechanical linkages and other moving components. Modular, standardized construction sets like Erector provided the ability to build a model, then take it apart and build something else, over and over again. Both AC-powered electric motors and battery-powered DC motors became available, usually equipped with gears to increase their torque and effective mechanical power. Later sets added miniature light bulbs and simple switches to control electrical power. Erector remains a very versatile constructional medium. Almost any mechanical device can be built with this system, from structures, to complex working cranes, automatic gearboxes or clocks. It is frequently used to prototype new ideas and inventions. Model realization using Erector is limited only by the imagination and ingenuity of the builder.Some components of a modern Erector Set History Exhibit in the Museum of the City of New York Erector was first envisioned by Alfred Carlton Gilbert (A.C. Gilbert) in 1911, as he rode the train from New Haven to New York City. This section of track was being converted to electrical power, and Gilbert watched as steel girders were erected to carry the power lines, inspiring him to develop the toy. Gilbert was a skilled magician and manufactured magic tricks and magic sets with his existing company the \\"Mysto Manufacturing Company\\". The first Erector set was made there in 1913, called \\"The Erector / Structural Steel and Electro-Mechanical Builder\\", and labeled as \\"Educational, Instructive and Amusing\\". The toy was first introduced and sold to the public in 1913 at the Toy Fair held at the Broadway Central Hotel in New York City. Erector quickly became the most popular construction toy in the United States, most likely because it was the only construction set at the time to contain a motor. In 1914, the name was changed to \\"The Mysto Erector, The Toy That Resembles Structural Steel\\". In 1916, the company was reorganized and became the A.C. Gilbert Company. The product was renamed \\"Gilbert Erector, The Toy Like Structural Steel\\". In 1924, more changes occurred, as the entire Erector system was completely overhauled to include over 70 types of parts. Erector was now called \\"The New Erector, The World‚Äôs Greatest Toy\\". Through 1932, Erector was sold in wooden boxes, but 1933 through 1962 the sets would be sold in colorful boxes made of painted steel. Early boxes were colored red, green, or blue; by the 1950s all set boxes were painted red. As the company grew, the area around the Gilbert factory became known as \\"Erector Square\\". A.C. Gilbert died in 1961, and the company went into decline, filing for bankruptcy in 1967. The product was redesigned, adding many plastic parts, but the \\"clunky\\" looking models failed to compete with the new, more-realistic scale plastic models coming onto the market. The Gabriel company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania bought the Erector brand name and continued to market the recently redesigned system. Sales were slow, and by the 1980s the trademark Erector was acquired by Ideal Toys and then Tyco Toys. In 2000, Meccano bought the Erector brand and unified its presence on all continents. The two brands are now sold under the Meccano brand name, with the Erector Set being marketed as \\"Erector by Meccano\\". In 2002, a movie based on A.C. Gilbert's life called The Man Who Saved Christmas was made for television. It focused on Gilbert's successful appeal to the Council of National Defense to reject a proposal to ban toy production in favor of wartime related materials during World War I. An extensive collection of A.C. Gilbert Company scientific and educational children's toys is housed at the Eli Whitney Museum, in Hamden, Connecticut. Applications Over the years, Erector Sets have been used to prototype a variety of devices, including: *In 1949, an Erector set was used to build the precursor to the modern artificial heart by William Sewell and Dr. William Glenn of the Yale School of Medicine. The external pump successfully bypassed the heart of a dog for more than an hour. *In the 1970s, information theory pioneer Claude Shannon constructed a bounce-juggling machine from an Erector set. *In the late 1980s, with an Erector Set, various old toys, and bits of jewelry, Jack Kevorkian jury-rigged a machine he called the Thanatron (later renamed to the Mercitron). Three bottles were suspended from a rickety beam, one filled with a saline solution to open a patient‚Äôs veins, another with barbiturates for sedation, and a third with potassium chloride to stop the heart. After Kevorkian connected the patient to an IV, he or she would pull a chain on the device to start the lethal medications flowing. He called it his ‚ÄúRube Goldberg suicide device.‚Äù *In the late 1990s, engineer Mark Sumner used Erector to create a working model for \\"Soarin‚Äô‚Äù, an attraction at Disney‚Äôs California Adventure in Anaheim, California and Walt Disney World's Epcot near Orlando, Florida. In 1990 Meccano S.A. built a giant Ferris wheel in France. It was modelled after the original 1893 Ferris Wheel built by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. at the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago and was shipped to the United States to promote \\"Erector by Meccano\\" after Meccano S.A. had bought out the Erector brand name and began selling Erector by Meccano sets in the U.S. It went on display in New York City after which it was purchased by Ripley's Believe It or Not! and put on display in their St. Augustine, Florida museum. The model, the largest in size at the time, is high, weighs , was made from 19,507 pieces, 50,560 nuts and bolts, and took 1,239 hours to construct. At this mass and size, some deviation from Erector by Meccano-only parts was a necessity, to prevent it collapsing (mainly in the structural spokes). The largest model by mass would certainly be in contention but some models have topped .[citation needed]  See also  *Anchor Stone Blocks *Chris Burden, artist who has used Erector and Meccano components to build large structures *Construx *Girder and Panel building sets *K'Nex *Lego *Lincoln Logs *M√§rklin *Meccano *Merkur sets *Steel Tec *Steel erector (profession) *Tinkertoy *Spin Master  References  External links  * *Project page at the Eli Whitney Museum website devoted to Erector Sets *Photographs, Downloads, Patents, Aids to Restoration *Movie: The Man Who Saved Christmas Category:Construction toys Category:Products introduced in 1911 Category:Metal toys Category:1910s toys Category:Educational toys ","title":"Erector Set"},{"id":"440357","text":"The Gold Country (also known as Mother Lode Country) is a historic region in the northern portion of the U.S. state of California, that is primarily on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. It is famed for the mineral deposits and gold mines that attracted waves of immigrants, known as the 49ers, during the 1849 California Gold Rush. History When gold was first discovered in 1848 many people came from all over the world to find gold. The migration into California brought diseases and violence. There were 500 mining camps which 300 are still undiscovered as of today. There was 400 million dollars in gold mined between 1849 and 1855. In 1942 most of the mines shut down due to World War II. The transportation in Gold Country grew rapidly due to the Gold Rush. The first railroad in California ran through Gold Country. There were 250 different stage coach companies formed by 1860. _Major Events Per County:_ Empire Mine Shaft Grass Valley California. * _Amador County_ ‚Äì At the time of the Gold Rush the Kennedy Mine was the deepest in the world at 5,919 feet. Argonaut Mine was from 1850 to 1942. In 1922, there was a fire in the area and 47 men were trapped in the mine and died. This mine was shut down due to the war. In Amador County it was such a rural area that they lacked government. Because of the lack of government, the citizens took care of the situations. Many people were hung within a day. * _Butte County_ ‚Äì Cherokee was hydraulic- mined from 1860 to 1870. Cherokee was the first place to find diamond in the United States in 1864. In Oroville was the Chinese temple which was established in 1863. The Chinese worked on the railroads and mining the area. * _Calaveras County_ ‚Äì This county was known for the biggest gold nugget found in the United States. The nugget weighed 195 lb. The nugget was found in Carson Hill. In Copperopolis, $72 million worth of copper was found. Many of the copper mines in this area supplied the Union armies needs in the Civil War. In 1856 Mitchler Hotel was built. Black Bart stayed in this hotel numerous times. * _El Dorado County_ ‚Äì This county is the key to the Gold Country. This is where gold was discovered in 1848 by James Marshall at Sutter's Mill. Sutter's fort was destroyed by all the people that came here from the Gold Rush. * _Mariposa County_ ‚Äì Located in the southern portion of Hwy 49. This county is known for the Ghirardelli Factory dated all the way back, 1855‚Äì1858. One of the mines that were in Mariposa County was the Princetown Mine which, pulled out $5 million in gold. * _Nevada County_ ‚Äì This county had the most gold out of all of Gold County pulled out of it totaling $440 million worth. Holbrooke Hotel is one of the oldest hotels still run to this day in Gold Country. It was built in 1851. Empire Mine one of the most- known mines in the area. (This mine is now a state park.) This mine runs 200 miles underground. This mine was still in operation after the war. One hundred million dollars' worth of gold was mined out of this mine. Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad was constructed in 1876. This railroad was made so that people can travel faster between Grass Valley to Nevada City. It was shut down in 1942. In 1851 in North Bloomfield a lot the mines were producing high volumes of gold but died out by 1853. Malakoff Diggings was known for its booming hydraulic mining. * _Placer County_ ‚Äì Colfax was known for a main station for supplies from the Central Pacific Railroad. Many of the area was known for quartz. About $2 million in quartz was found. Placer County was known for the robber \\"Rattlesnake Dick\\" in 1850. * _Plumas County_ ‚Äì Gold was first found in this county at Rabbit Creek. 60 million in gold was found in the La Porte area. John Bidwell first discovered gold in the Feather River. Spanish Ranch had over $100 million worth of gold come out of it. In Crescent Mill they found a gold vein 20 feet thick. This was a hole in the mountain in La Porte, California. It was used to divert the water in Slate Creek. * _Sierra County_ ‚Äì Allegheny was known for a 163-pound gold nugget. The mine was shut down during the war but then was opened back up in 1965. This mine is still mined occasionally today. In 1992 seventy thousand dollars was mined out of it. In 1849 gold was first found in the Yuba river in Downieville. A 427-pound nugget was found there. Hydraulic mining happened at Howland Flat and Poker Flat in the 1850s. Seven hundred thousand dollars' worth of gold came out of Poker Flat alone. * _Tuolumne County_ ‚Äì In Knights Ferry there was the largest covered bridge on the west coast dating back to 1862. In Jamestown they found a 75-pound golden nugget. Sierra Railroad House was built in 1897. It was a popular site for filming movies. Eagle Shawmut Mine had $7.4 million mined out of it. * _Yuba County_ ‚Äì This county was known for dredging the rivers, mills, hydraulic mining and its many little towns. Most of the towns were built around trails. They provided hotels, stores, and bars for the newcomers. They had one of the largest dredgers ever, in the Yuba River at one point. It dredged 4.8 million ounces of gold. Black Bart was known in this area for robbing the Wells Fargo stagecoaches coming from La Porte. Colgate Powerhouse went into use for the first time in 1899. It supplied power to Sacramento and Oroville. One of the most famous towns in Yuba County was Camptonville. Gold was first discovered in this town in 1850. The area under the town was so rich in gold that they moved the town to get to the gold. Marysville was known for a main place that people brought their gold to be shipped out to San Francisco. Millions of dollars in gold came through Marysville, one of the biggest cities in California at the time. Geology The Gold Country lies on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, reaching down to the Sacramento Valley. The oldest geology can be found along the easternmost portions of this region, closer to the Sierra Nevada summits, which formed 100 million years ago. It consists of ancient sea floor and portions of islands which were added onto the western edge of North America during the late Paleozoic, about 275 million years ago. The western sections of the Mother Lode are significantly younger, from the mid-Mesozoic about 150 million years ago, and also consist of material that was solidified on the ocean floor to the continental edge. Massive intrusions of granite forced their way into these formations. After ten miles of overlying material was eroded over the last 70 million years, these intrusions became visible throughout the Sierra Nevada. Over the last 50 million years, rivers and volcanoes deposited materials; these built up in thick layers found atop many of the high ridges of the Sierra Nevada foothills. Climate This part of California has a Mediterranean climate like much of Italy and Spain, making wine grapes and vineyards one of the region's primary crops and industry.[citation needed] Over 100 wineries are found throughout the Gold Country. Winters are cool and wet with occasional snowfall, especially in the higher elevations of the eastern reaches up the slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Winter temperatures range from the upper twenties to mid-fifties. Summers are dry and hot, with long stretches that reach triple digits. The average annual precipitation is around . Many dams were built in the Sierra Nevada to hold water. People in California depend on the water that comes from the Sierra Nevada mountains. Transportation California State Route 49 is the primary north‚Äìsouth highway through the region, passing through many historic mining communities. Major east‚Äìwest highways include Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 50. Two Amtrak routes run through the area. The eastern terminus of the Capitol Corridor is in Auburn. The California Zephyr stops in Colfax.

Slovar stare knji≈æne prekmur≈°ƒçine. Ljubljana: ZRC SAZU, pp. 262, 269. or M√∂ra) is a river in Central Europe rising in the Hohe Tauern national park of the Central Eastern Alps in Austria with its source being above sea level. It is a tributary of the Drava and subsequently the Danube. The Mur's total length is around . About 326 km are within the interior of Austria; 95 km flow in and around Slovenia (67 km along the borders with Austria and Croatia, 28 km inside Slovenia), and the rest forms the border between Croatia and Hungary. The largest city on the river is Graz, Austria. Its basin covers an area of . Tributaries of the Mur include the M√ºrz, the Sulm, the ≈†ƒçavnica, the Ledava and the Trnava. Etymology The river was attested as Maura in AD 799, Muora in 890, Mura in 1259, Mvr and Mver in 1310, and Muer in 1354. The name is probably of Slavic origin, nominalized from the adjective *mur—ä 'dark', meaning 'dark water'. River course The river rises in a remote valley within the Lungau region of Austrian state of Salzburg. The river flows eastwards through Tamsweg before crossing the border into the state of Styria. Between Tamsweg and Unzmarkt- Frauenburg the river flows through a rural mountain valley and is closely paralleled by the long narrow gauge Murtalbahn railway. From Unzmarkt the river continues in an easterly direction through the industrial towns of Leoben and Bruck an der Mur. At Bruck an der Mur the M√ºrz joins the Mur, which turns sharply south to flow through the city of Graz. The river flows through the centre of Graz, passing underneath the Schlo√überg and by the historic Inner City. As a result of being the European Capital of Culture for 2003, an artificial island known as the Murinsel was constructed in the middle of the river. Once heavily polluted by several paper mills on the shore and by the ironworks around Leoben, the water quality has improved since the 1980s and the river is now seen as an asset to the city. From Graz the river continues to flow south, past the town of Leibnitz to its nearby confluence with the Sulm, where it adopts a more easterly course. Near Spielfeld, the river forms the border between Austria and Slovenia, a role it retains until just after the twin towns of Bad Radkersburg and Gornja Radgona, where it passes fully into Slovenia. In Slovenia it passes the towns of Radenci, and Ver≈æej. The river gives its name to the Slovenian region of Prekmurje (literally 'across the Mur') and the Croatian region of Meƒëimurje (literally 'between the Mur'). Cable ferries and ship mills are still found in this area. In the upper Meƒëimurje area, in the western part of the region, the Mur floods and changes its course rather often, moving slowly toward the north on its left. Here, the biggest forest along the river, the Mur≈°ƒçak, is located between Doma≈°inec and Donji Hra≈°ƒáan (derived from Croatian hrast 'oak'). After receiving its last significant tributary Trnava, the river ends near Legrad in Koprivnica- Kri≈æevci county, Croatia, where it flows into the Drava River. Exploitation Since the 4th century BC, there have been reports of floating mills powered by the streams of the river. The ancient technology was adopted later by arriving Slavs and then by Magyars. Several decades ago, in the 1920s and 1930s, many of these mills were still operating along the river. At least one of the old mills, the Babiƒç Mill () near Ver≈æej, Slovenia, continues to operate to this day. The Mur is known to carry small quantities of gold, not enough to be suitable for exploitation today, but this was a focus of activity for many people since ancient times. Organized research and exploitation of gold and other local resources was encouraged for the first time in 1772. In Austria, several hydroelectric dams have been constructed for the production of renewable energy. The word \\"renewable\\" may be misleading in the case of smaller hydroelectric plants whose output is small by comparison to the environmental cost of construction. Currently in 2017, a hydroelectric dam is under construction in Puntigam, a few km south of the Graz city centre. The plan includes a massive sewage pipe between the city centre and the new dam, necessitating the felling of thousands of trees. The project is controversial and environmental groups are resisting it. Both environmental impact and economic studies have found the project to be neither ecologically nor economically viable. Additional hydroelectric plants are planned for Slovenia. Monitoring The hydrological parameters of the Mur are regularly monitored in Croatia at Mursko Sredi≈°ƒáe.

It lies between, and within, the Imperial and Coachella valleys, all of which lie within the larger Salton Trough, a pull-apart basin that stretches to the Gulf of California in Mexico. The lake occupies the lowest elevations of the trough, known as the Salton Sink, where the lake surface is below sea level as of January 2018. The deepest point of the lake is only higher than the lowest point of Death Valley. The New, Whitewater, and Alamo rivers, combined with agricultural runoff, are the primary sources that feed the lake. Over millions of years, the Colorado River has flowed into the Imperial Valley and deposited alluvium (soil) creating fertile farmland, building up the terrain and constantly moving its main (or only) river delta. For thousands of years, the river has alternately flowed into and out of the valley, alternately creating a freshwater lake, an increasingly saline lake, and a dry desert basin, depending on river flows and the balance between inflow and evaporative loss. The cycle of filling has been about every 400‚Äì500 years and has repeated many times. One such most notable instance took place around 700 AD - great flows of water into the basin, creating Lake Cahuilla, which at its peak was long, wide, and deep, making it one of the largest lakes in North America. This watering of the basin, during extended severe drought, benefited hunter-gatherers who lived there: although the water was too saline to drink, its presence attracted fish and waterfowl to the area.Fagan, Brian (2008) The Great Warming: Climate Change and the Rise and Fall of Civilizations New York: Bloomsbury Press. pp.117-118. The lake existed for over 600 years until the intake silted up, leaving a closed basin that dried up in around 50 years. The latest natural cycle occurred around 1600‚Äì1700 AD, according to Native Americans who spoke with the first European settlers. Fish traps still exist at many locations, and the Native Americans evidently moved the traps depending upon the cycle. The inflow of water from the now heavily controlled Colorado River was accidentally created by the engineers of the California Development Company in 1905. To provide water to the Imperial Valley for farming, beginning in 1900, an irrigation canal was dug from the Colorado River to the old Alamo River channel, directing the water west and then north near Mexicali. The headgates and canals suffered silt buildup, so a series of cuts were made in the bank of the Colorado River to further increase the water flow. The resulting outflow overwhelmed the third intake, \\"Mexican Cut\\", near Yuma, Arizona, and the river flowed into the Salton Basin for two years, filling what was then a dry lake bed and creating the modern sea, before repairs were completed.Cory, Harry Thomas & Blake, William Phipps, The Imperial Valley and the Salton Sink; Trover, Ellen Lloyd, Birth of the Inland Sea: How the Colorado River Created the Salton Sea While it varies in dimensions and area with fluctuations in agricultural runoff and rainfall, the Salton Sea is about . With an estimated surface area of or , the Salton Sea is the largest lake in California by surface area. The average annual inflow is less than , which is enough to maintain a maximum depth of and a total volume of about . However, due to changes in water apportionments agreed upon for the Colorado River under the Quantification Settlement Agreement of 2003, the surface area of the sea is expected to decrease by 60% between 2013 and 2021. The lake's salinity, about , is greater than that of the Pacific Ocean (), but less than that of the Great Salt Lake (which ranges from ). The concentration has been increasing at a rate of about 3% per year.See https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/SaltonSea_2004-2014.xlsx, linked at https://www2.usgs.gov/saltonsea/monitoring.html About of salt are deposited in the valley each year. In 2020, Palm Springs Life magazine summarized the ecological situation as \\"Salton Sea derives its fame as the biggest environmental disaster in California history\\".Bombay Beach Gets Lit History The area was once part of a vast inland sea that covered a large area of Southern California. Geologists estimate that for three million years, at least through all the years of the Pleistocene glacial age, a large delta was deposited by the Colorado River in the southern region of the Imperial Valley. Eventually, the delta reached the western shore of the Gulf of California, creating a barrier that separated the area of the Salton Sea from the northern reaches of the Gulf. Were it not for this barrier, the entire Salton Sink along with the Imperial Valley would be submerged as the Gulf would extend as far north as Indio. Since the exclusion of the ocean, the Salton Basin has over the ages been alternately a freshwater lake, an increasingly saline endorheic lake, and a dry desert basin, depending on river flows and the balance between inflow and evaporative loss. A lake exists only during times it is replenished by the rivers and rainfall, a cycle that has repeated many times over hundreds of thousands of years, perhaps cycling every 400 to 500 years. Evidence that the basin was occupied periodically by multiple lakes includes wave-cut shorelines at various elevations preserved on the hillsides of the east and west margins of the present lake, the Salton Sea. These indicate that the basin was occupied intermittently as recently as a few hundred years ago. The last of the Pleistocene lakes to occupy the basin was Lake Cahuilla, also periodically identified on older maps as Lake LeConte or the Blake Sea, after American professor and geologist William Phipps Blake. Throughout the Spanish period of California's history, the area was referred to as the \\"Colorado Desert\\" after the Colorado River. In a railroad survey completed in 1855, it was called \\"the Valley of the Ancient Lake\\". On several old maps from the Library of Congress, it has been found labeled \\"Cahuilla Valley\\" (after the local Native American tribe) and \\"Cabazon Valley\\" (after a local Native American chief ‚Äì Chief Cabazon). \\"Salt Creek\\" first appeared on a map in 1867 and \\"Salton Station\\" is on a railroad map from 1900, although this place had been there as a rail stop since the late 1870s. Until the advent of the modern sea, the Salton Sink was the site of a major salt-mining operation.The Salton Sea ‚Äì Its Beginnings. Accessed 2010-06-14 History during the 1900s Imperial Canal\\" In 1900, the California Development Company began construction of irrigation canals to divert water from the Colorado River into the Salton Sink, a dry lake bed. After construction of these irrigation canals, the Salton Sink became fertile for a time, allowing farmers to plant crops. Within two years, the Imperial Canal became filled with silt from the Colorado River. Engineers tried to alleviate the blockages to no avail. In 1905, heavy rainfall and snowmelt caused the Colorado River to swell, overrunning the third intake cut into the bank of the river and sending the flood into the Alamo Canal. The resulting flood poured down the canal, and down two former dry arroyos: the New River in the west, and the Alamo River in the east, each about long.Detailed maps, and a film of the breach (and subsequent redamming) are in Plagues & Pleasures on the Salton Sea, a 2006 documentary Over about two years, these two newly created rivers cory & blake, The Imperial Valley and the Salton Sink, a reprint of Irrigation and River Control in the Colorao River Delta, Transaction American Society of Engineers, vol. LXXVI. carried the entire volume of the Colorado River into the Salton Sink. The Southern Pacific Railroad tried to stop the flooding by dumping earth into the canal's headgates area, but the effort was not fast enough, and the river eroded deeper and deeper into the dry desert sand of the Imperial Valley. A large waterfall formed as a result and began cutting rapidly upstream along the path of the Alamo Canal that now was occupied by the Colorado. This waterfall was initially high, but grew to high before the flow through the breach was stopped. Originally, it was feared that the waterfall would recede upstream to the true main path of the Colorado, becoming up to high, at which point it would be practically impossible to fix the problem. Salton Sea As the basin filled, the town of Salton, a Southern Pacific Railroad siding, and Torres-Martinez Native American land were submerged. The sudden influx of water and the lack of any drainage from the basin resulted in the formation of the Salton Sea. The U.S. Navy conducted a preliminary inspection of the Salton Sea in January 1940, and the Salton Sea Test Base (SSTB, run by Sandia Labs) was initially commissioned as the Naval Auxiliary Air Station Salton Sea, in October 1942. The SSTB, just to the southeast of Salton City, originally functioned as an operational and training base for seaplanes. Additional activities at the base included experimental testing of solid-fuel plane-launched rockets, jet-assist take-off testing, aeroballistic testing of inert atomic weapon test units at land and marine target areas, training bombing at marine targets, testing of the effects of long-term storage on atomic weapons, testing of the Project Mercury space capsule parachute landing systems, parachute training and testing, and military training exercises. The base was abandoned in 1978. The continuing intermittent flooding of the Imperial Valley from the Colorado River led to the idea of the need for a desilting dam on the Colorado River for flood control. The Imperial Dam was built to avoid the flooding that created the Salton Sea. Subsequent evolution An article in June 2018 stated that as \\"California‚Äôs largest lake dries up, it threatens nearby communities with clouds of toxic dust\\", increasing the incidence of asthma among the population. The coverage added that \\"the air in Imperial County is some of the worst in the country, a dense blend of ozone and particulate matter\\". An April 2020 news item stated that in the Eastern Coachella, communities were facing \\"disproportionately higher rates of asthma and respiratory complications\\" because of high concentrations of contaminants in the air\\". Communities The Salton Sea had some success as a resort area, with Salton City, Salton Sea Beach, and Desert Shores, on the western shore and Desert Beach, North Shore, and Bombay Beach, built on the eastern shore in the 1950s. However, many of the settlements substantially shrank in size, or have been abandoned, mostly due to the increasing salinity and pollution of the lake over the years from agricultural runoff and other sources. Many of the species of fish that lived in the sea have been killed off by the combination of pollutants, salt levels, and algal blooms. Dead fish have been known to wash up in mass quantities on the beaches. The smell of the lake, combined with the stench of the decaying fish, also contributed to the decline of the tourist industry around the Salton Sea. The US Geological Survey describes the smell as \\"objectionable\\", \\"noxious\\", \\"unique\\", and \\"pervasive\\". A 2020 article provided this comment about the settlements around the Salton Sea:Bombay Beach CA Rediscovered > Since 2011, Bombay Beach and its surrounds have been reinvented as a > destination for desert art. It‚Äôs not alone in that distinction ‚Äì south of > the city lie the towns of Niland and Slab City, other areas that have > attracted artists and led to creations like East Jesus and Salvation > Mountain. Some people are visiting the Salton Sea and the surrounding settlements to explore the abandoned structures and see the squatter settlement of Slab City. The town of Niland is southeast of the sea, with a population of 1,006. In late June 2020, a fire in Niland caused a great deal of damage in Niland, displacing 112 people; by that time, the estimated population had diminished to 500. Smithsonian magazine in October 2018 referred to Slab City as a \\"Squatters‚Äô Paradise\\" which locals consider to be \\"one of America's last free places\\". The article said of the population: \\"There are clearly people there who don‚Äôt want to be found, so there‚Äôs something about disappearing, and the desert offers that kind of opportunity\\". The population of Bombay Beach declined for years and the buildings were rotting away, but some people had moved into the settlement. A news item in April 2018 stated that it was \\"enjoying a rebirth of sorts with an influx of artists, intellectuals and hipsters who have turned it into a bohemian playground\\". The population estimate for 2020 was 415 persons, certainly higher than the official census number of 295 in 2010. Climate According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, the Salton Sea has a Hot desert climate (BWh). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone is 9b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of 28.5 ¬∞F (‚àí1.9 ¬∞C). The temperature of the surface water changes with the seasonally varying air temperature. Winter surface water can reach temperatures as low as and summer surface water highs can reach . Ecology Dead fish on the western shore of Salton City Potential natural vegetation According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, the area roughly within of the sandy shoreline of the Salton Sea would have a Saltbush / Greasewood (40) vegetation type and a Great Basin Shrubland (7) vegetation form. Fish population Due to the high salinity, very few fish species can tolerate living in the Salton Sea. Introduced tilapia (hybrid Mozambique √ó Wami) are the main fish that can tolerate the high salinity levels and pollution. As of 2014, other fresh and brackish water fish species lived in the rivers and canals that fed the Salton Sea, including redbelly tilapia, threadfin shad, carp, red shiner, channel catfish, white catfish, largemouth bass, mosquitofish, sailfin molly, and the vulnerable desert pupfish. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught in the Salton Sea based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in local species. A September 2019 report stated that ten years earlier, \\"there were some 100 million fish in the Sea. Now, more than 97 percent of those fish are gone\\".Salton Sea +20 Avian population The Salton Sea has been termed a \\"crown jewel of avian biodiversity\\" by Dr. Milt Friend of the Salton Sea Science Office. Over 400 species have been documented at the Salton Sea. The most diverse and probably the most significant populations of bird life in the continental United States are hosted, rivaled only by Big Bend National Park in Texas.Morrison, Patt (September 17, 2014) \\"A persuasive case for saving the Salton Sea, California's biggest lake\\". Los Angeles Times Interview with Tim Krantz It supports 30% of the remaining population of the American white pelican. The Salton Sea is also a major resting stop on the Pacific Flyway. On 18 November 2006, a Ross's gull, a high Arctic bird, was sighted and photographed there. A December 2018 report by the National Georgraphic Society stated that the Sea is an important stopover point for migrating birds. \\"Nearly all of California‚Äôs population of eared grebes, for example, stop over at the lake, and at least a third of all the white pelicans living in North America ...\\" The report expressed concern about the reducing input of water into the Sea and the increasing salinity. \\"Without that extra water, the lake‚Äôs shrinking will start to accelerate‚Äîmaking it saltier, smaller, less welcoming to the birds that rely on it during migration\\".The West Coast‚Äôs biggest bird oasis is dying. Will it be saved? Increasing salinity Salt deposits along the eastern shore of the sea The lack of an outflow means the Salton Sea does not have a natural stabilization system; it is very dynamic. Fluctuations in the water level caused by variations in agricultural runoff, the ancient salt deposits in the lake bed, and the relatively high salinity of the inflow feeding the sea are all causing increasing salinity. The body was initially a freshwater lake, but by the 1960s, its rising salinity had begun to jeopardize some of its species. With a salinity now exceeding 5.0% w/v (saltier than seawater), most species of fish can no longer survive. A freshwater fish notable for its ability to withstand the rising salinity of the Salton Sea, the desert pupfish, can survive salinities ranging from 0.0% to 7.0%.Dudek and ICF International (2012). Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) Baseline Biology Report. (Draft). Prepared for the California Energy Commission. Fertilizer runoffs have resulted in eutrophication, with large algal blooms and elevated bacterial levels.NASA page: \\"Algal bloom in the Salton Sea, California\\". Both the hypersalinity and presence of contaminants in the Salton Sea triggered massive die-offs in the fish and avian populations; Salt water carries less oxygen than fresh water, which was further depleted by algal blooms and by extreme temperatures during the summer period, and the contamination promoted the outbreak and spread of diseases such as avian cholera. In turn, the loss of several species of fish that the avian population depended on for food increased their risk of starvation, exacerbating their decline. By the 1970s, the runoff which was full of salty chemicals led to a warning that the salinity of the lake would no longer sustain wildlife; that occurred by the early 1980s.As the Salton Sea shrinks, it leaves behind a toxic reminder of the cost of making a desert bloom In November 2019, an emergency was declared because of the \\"heavily polluted New River, which empties into the Salton Sea\\". Some were hoping that this would help to accelerate a restoration project which would enable the state to obtain federal funding. By January 2020, the salinity of the Salton Sea was double that of the Atlantic Ocean.As the Salton Sea shrinks, it leaves behind a toxic reminder of the cost of making a desert bloom An undated report on the Imperial County web site provided these specifics: \\"Salton Sea salinity is about 44,000 mg/L, that is approximately 4.4% salt. The amount of salts that is deposited in the Imperial Valley agricultural land with irrigation water is approximately four million tons of salts annually. To maintain crop productivities, equal amount of salts must be leached from the root zone\\".Salton Sea and Salinity Geology=Earthquakes and tectonic setting Aerial view of the Salton Sea from the north Aerial view of the Salton Sea from the south The Salton Sea and surrounding basin sits over the San Andreas Fault, San Jacinto Fault, Imperial Fault Zone, and a \\"stepover fault\\" shear zone system. Geologists have determined that previous flooding episodes from the Colorado River have been linked to earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault. Sonar and other instruments were used to map the Salton Sea's underwater faults during the study. During the period when the basin was filled by Lake Cahuilla, a much larger inland sea, earthquakes higher than magnitude 7 occurred roughly every 180 years, the last one occurring within decades of 1700. Computer models suggest the normal faults in the area are most vulnerable to deviatoric stress loading by filling in of water. Currently, a risk still exists for an earthquake of magnitude 7 to 8. Simulations also showed, in the Los Angeles area, shaking and thus damage would be more severe for a San Andreas earthquake that propagated along the fault from the south, rather than from the north. Such an earthquake also raises the risk for soil liquefaction in the Imperial Valley region.Brothers, Daniel, et al. \\"Loading of the San Andreas fault by flood-induced rupture of faults beneath the Salton Sea.\\" Nature Geoscience 4.7 (2011): 486‚Äì92. The effective drainage divide that separates the Salton Sea from the Gulf of California is about in elevation and is located near Delta, northeastern Baja California State, Mexico, south-southeast of Mexicali. Past sea level rise may partially be responsible for the salinity of the lake, while potential future changes in sea levels could occur. However, other factors such as hydrothermal vents, diffusion of salt from minerals and sediment, including concentrated brine, and evaporites are another contributor to salinity, as is the recent lowering of lake levels raising the salinity, though sedimentary records show the lake surface elevation reached levels 10‚Äì12 m above world sea level in the 1500s. Volcanism A gaseous mud volcano Evidence of geothermal activity is also visible. The Salton Buttes are volcanoes in the geothermal field of the same name. Mudpots and mud volcanoes are found on the eastern side of the Salton Sea. The area is used for geothermal electricity generation, with plants located along the southeastern shore of the Salton Sea in Imperial County. Remediation efforts=Early efforts and proposals for a sea level canal New River and Alamo River courses Alternatives for \\"saving\\" the Salton Sea have been evaluated since 1955. New River passes from Mexicali, Baja California, to the Imperial Valley, and on to the Salton Sea. Interest in the sea was sparked in the 1990s by Congressman Sonny Bono.CNN article: \\"Salton Sea rescue to be named for Sonny Bono\\". His widow, Mary Bono Mack, elected to fill his seat, has continued to be interested in the Salton Sea, as has Representative Jerry Lewis of Redlands. In 1998, the Sonny Bono Salton Sea Restoration Project was named for the politician. In the late 1990s, the Salton Sea Authority, a local joint powers agency, and the US Bureau of Reclamation began efforts to evaluate and develop an alternative to save the Salton Sea. A draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement, which did not specify a preferred alternative, was released for public review in 2000. Since that time, the Salton Sea Authority has developed a preferred concept that involves the construction of a large dam that would impound water to create a marine sea in the northern and southern parts of the sea and along the western edge. Satellite image of the Salton Sea with surrounding developments Many other concepts have been proposed. Aqua Genesis Ltd propose to bring in seawater from the Gulf of California, rapidly desalinate it at Salton Sea tapping into geothermal heat, then sell the non- saline water. This concept would involve the construction of over of pipes and tunneling; amid increasing water demand, it would provide of water to Southern California coastal cities each year.sandiegoreader.com; San Diego Union Times: Ronald Newcomb's Salton Sea proposal One vying project as to the sea salt market is to pipe seawater to a wetland in Mexico, Laguna Salada for that trade. State restoration plan Abandoned, salt-encrusted structures on the Salton Sea shore at Bombay Beach In 2003, the Imperial Irrigation District agreed to sell a portion of its allotment from the Colorado River for 45 years to the San Diego County Water Authority.Perry, Tony (September 3, 2014) \\"'Salton Sea inaction could cause 'catastrophic change,' report says\\" Los Angeles Times The California State Legislature, by legislation enacted in 2003 and 2004, directed the Secretary of the California Resources Agency to prepare a restoration plan for the Salton Sea ecosystem, and an accompanying Environmental Impact Report. As part of this effort, the Secretary for Resources has established an advisory committee to provide recommendations to assist in the preparation of the Ecosystem Restoration Plan, including consultation throughout all stages of the alternative selection. The California Department of Water Resources and California Department of Fish and Game are leading the effort to develop a preferred alternative for the restoration of the Salton Sea ecosystem and the protection of wildlife dependent on that ecosystem. On January 24, 2008, the California Legislative Analyst's Office released a report titled \\"Restoring the Salton Sea.\\" The preferred alternative outlined in the draft plan calls for spending almost $9 billion over 25 years and proposes a smaller but more manageable Salton Sea. The amount of water available for use by humans and wildlife would be reduced by 60% from to about . About of barrier and perimeter dikesconstructed most likely out of boulders, gravel, and stone columnswould be erected, along with earthen berms to corral the water into a horseshoe shape along the northern shoreline of the sea from San Felipe Creek on the west shore to Bombay Beach on the east shore. The central portion of the sea would be allowed to evaporate almost completely and would serve as a brine sink, while the southern portion of the sea would be constructed into a saline habitat complex. Construction on the project would be completed by 2035. By 2014, large swaths of lake bed were exposed and salt levels drastically increased due to mandated water transfers to metropolitan areas along the coast and other factors, limiting the water inflow. Besides the resulting fish kills, the shrinking lake interrupts the bird migration, causes dust clouds, and negatively impacts local tourism.Ra√±oa, Raoul (October 21, 2014) \\"'Drought, drawdowns and death of the Salton Sea\\" Los Angeles Times During the first 15 years after the sale of the Imperial water to San Diego County, the irrigation district has been required to put water into the Salton Sea to compensate for the loss of agricultural runoff needed to replenish the sea. Since the requirement expired in 2017, the district sent a letter to the California State Water Resources Control Board in 2014 asking that the board sponsor negotiations to get the state to fulfill its obligation to stop the deterioration of the sea. Pacific Institute, an Oakland-based environmental think tank, was warning that the lack of replenishment water was leading to a \\"period of very rapid deterioration.\\"Perry, Tony (November 21, 2014) \\"'Looming environmental crisis' at Salton Sea prompts plea for help\\" Los Angeles Times The rapidly shrinking sea was a \\"looming environmental and public health crisis\\" With the increased shrinkage, dust storms would increase and a rotten- egg smell could reach to the coastal cities. In 2018, California's Natural Resources Agency received 11 proposals to increase waterflow to the sea in order to reduce dust and dust-borne toxins. Proposal costs ranged from $300 million to several billion dollars. No winner was selected in this phase. In February 2020, the agency finished the \\"Bruchard Road Dust Suppression Project\\" and reported further actions to be taken until 2028. A July 2020 news item (written by a lobby group) discussed one method to improve the Sea \\"to prevent wind spreading toxic dust\\": refilling it with water imported from the Sea of Cort√©s; that would require the building of an aqueduct. (A June 9 research report however stated that the cost of \\"transferring water from agricultural users to the Salton Sea\\" would be lower and achievable using existing infrastructure).Boons or boondoggles: An assessment of the Salton Sea water importation options The aqueduct proposal, and others, hang on the outcome of a feasibility study expected in late 2021.Valley Voice: Importing water to save the Salton Sea can work. Let's prove and do it now In popular culture An abandoned boat stuck in the ground, close to the west coast marina of the Salton Sea Films * A visit to the Salton Sea inspired filmmaker Curtis Harrington to make his dreamlike short film On the Edge (1949), which extensively uses the bubbling mudpots on the edge of the sea. In a 1971 interview, Harrington stated, \\"The location I used is entirely covered by water now; the sea has risen to cover it.\\" * As the sea started its decline, independent filmmakers discovered its unique landscape. In the 1990s, a trio of unusual films was shot in the Salton-Sea-area. In 1990 Richard Newton created Small White House, a film exploring a love triangle between JFK, Jackie O., and Marilyn Monroe. In 1991, Nina Menkes made Queen of Diamonds, which explores the life of an alienated Las Vegas blackjack dealer. Queen of Diamonds features a wedding reception held on the beach of the Salton Sea, whose guests includes an Elvis impersonator. The Entire History of the Louisiana Purchase (1998) is an early example of the pseudo-documentary. Joshua Oppenheimer's film includes some striking post-apocalyptic color sequences shot along the banks of the Salton Sea. * The film, The Monster That Challenged The World (1957), deals with gigantic prehistoric mollusks that are reawakened after residing, in suspended animation, at the bottom of the Salton Sea. * The film, The Salton Sea (2002), is an American crime thriller named after and partially filmed at the Salton Sea. * The New York Times described the film about some residents of the Bombay Beach, California community on the Salton Sea, Bombay Beach (2010), by Israeli-born filmmaker Alma Har'el, as a \\"surreal documentary\\". The film won first prize in the feature documentary section of the Tribeca Film Festival in 2011. * The short documentary, The Useless Sea (2016), is a cinematic film focusing on the environmental challenges and the beauty surrounding the Salton Sea. * The documentary, SOS: The Salton Sea Walk (2017) documents efforts to raise awareness of environmental consequences and conservation possibilities for the area. * The American independent drama, Desert Shores (2019) was filmed at the Salton Sea and based on George McCormick's short story Salton Sea. The film is primarily set in the Desert Shores community, for which the film is named. * Miracle in the Desert: The Rise and Fall of the Salton Sea (2020) is an award-winning documentary that tells the full origin of the creation of the sea, as well as the real estate boom and bust from 1950-1970 while examining the exodus of people from the sea and the current environmental crisis it faces. Games * In the video-game Grand Theft Auto V (2013), a location called the Alamo Sea is based on the Salton Sea; Sandy Shores, a town that sits on the lake's southern edge, is based on the town of Desert Shores.

Fleming was a Democrat. He was a Confederate soldier and lawyer before he became governor. Biography Fleming was born in Panama Park (now part of Jacksonville) in Duval County, Florida. He spent his early years with his parents, Lewis Fleming and his second wife Margaret Seton, on their St. Johns River plantation, \\"Hibernia\\". The plantation narrowly escaped destruction at the hands of the Independent Battalion, Massachusetts Cavalry in mid-April 1864 when Colonel Guy V. Henry, a relative of the Fleming family, ordered it spared. During the American Civil War, Fleming served the Confederate cause by enlisting as a private in the 2nd Florida Regiment and received a battlefield promotion to first lieutenant, and subsequently to the rank of captain. After being wounded, Fleming returned to Florida and actively enlisted new volunteers, commanding a volunteer company at the Battle of Natural Bridge at St. Marks on March 6, 1865. By the end of the war, Fleming had served under four generals: John Magruder, Joseph Johnston, John Bell Hood, and Robert E. Lee. After the war, Francis Fleming studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1868, becoming a partner in the firm of Fleming and Daniel, later Fleming and Fleming. In 1871, he married Floride Lydia Pearson, the daughter of Florida Supreme Court justice Bird M. Pearson. Together the couple had three children: Francis Philip Jr., Elizabeth Fleming, and Charles Seton. Francis P. Fleming authored a book memorializing his brother, titled The Florida Troops/A Memoir of Captain C. Seton Fleming C.S.A., originally published by Times-Union Publishing House, Jacksonville, Florida, 1884. Its preface includes: \\"The preparation of the following pages was not commenced with the design of publication; but for the purpose of collecting and preserving in manuscript form, a brief memoir of one, in whose life was combined all the elements of true nobility, with that daring heroism which characterized his service as a soldier, during the most eventful period of this country's history, which I felt might be read with profit and pleasure by kindred of another generation.\\" Original copies are quite rare. Fleming later entered politics, and became the fifteenth Governor of Florida on January 8, 1889, serving until January 3, 1893, the sole term provided by state law at that time. Notable events during Fleming's term include: * The creation of a state Board of Health to stop a yellow fever epidemic that was sweeping the state; * The repeal of the Florida Railroad Commission, at the urging of railroad baron Henry Flagler; * The start of a reorganization of higher education institutions; * Adjustment of state revenues; * The Farmers' Alliance movement; * The 1891 reelection dispute of Senator Wilkinson Call. Fleming later advocated adding a red saltire, or diagonal cross, to the Florida flag, in order to distinguish it from a flag of surrender (the flag at that time was a white flag with the Florida seal in the center). This proposal was adopted in 1900 by a statewide referendum. Fleming also began the tradition of having an official portrait painted and hung in the Florida State Capitol. After he left office, Fleming served on the board of trustees of the new Florida Old Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Home. On December 20, 1908, Fleming died following a long illness. He is buried at the Old City Cemetery in Jacksonville. Facts Francis P. Fleming was the son Lewis Fleming (1798‚Äì1862) and his second wife, Margaret Seton. Fleming Island, Florida (an un-incorporated community in between Orange Park and Green Cove Springs in Clay County, Florida, was part of the Fleming family's Spanish Land Grants. The area has since retained the name Fleming Island. The former governor and his wife, Floride, are buried in The Old City Cemetery, Jacksonville, Florida. University Athletic Field, the original football facility at the University of Florida, was renamed Fleming Field in 1915 at the urging of the late governor's son, Francis P. Fleming Jr., who served on the university's Board of Control, and was an alumnus of the class of 1922. The venue was replaced by much larger Florida Field in 1930, but the grassy area to the north of the current stadium is still known as Fleming Field.

They are cosmopolitan, found in oceans around the world. There are over 1300 known species, with legs ranging from to over . Most are toward the smaller end of this range in relatively shallow depths; however, they can grow to be quite large in Antarctic and deep waters. Although \\"sea spiders\\" are not true spiders, or even arachnids, their traditional classification as chelicerates would place them closer to true spiders than to other well-known arthropod groups, such as insects or crustaceans. This is in dispute, however, as genetic evidence suggests they may be the sister group to all other living arthropods. Description Anatomy of a pycnogonid: A: head; B: thorax; C: abdomen 1: proboscis; 2: chelifores; 3: palps; 4: s; 5: egg sacs; 6a‚Äì6d: four pairs of legs Sea spiders have long legs in contrast to a small body size. The number of walking legs is usually eight (four pairs), but species with five and six pairs exist. Pycnogonids do not require a traditional respiratory system. Instead, gasses are absorbed by the legs and trasferred through the body by diffusion. A proboscis allows them to suck nutrients from soft-bodied invertebrates, and their digestive tract has diverticula extending into the legs. hydroid Certain pycnogonids are so small that each of their very tiny muscles consists of only one single cell, surrounded by connective tissue. The anterior region consists of the proboscis, which has fairly limited dorsoventral and lateral movement, and three to four appendages including the s, which are used in caring for young and cleaning as well as courtship. In some species, the chelifores, palps and ovigers can be reduced or missing in adults. In those species that lack chelifores and palps, the proboscis is well developed and more mobile and flexible, often equipped with numerous sensory bristles and strong rasping ridges around the mouth. The last segment includes the anus and tubercle, which projects dorsally. In total, pycnogonids have four to six pairs of legs for walking as well as other appendages which often resemble legs. A cephalothorax and much smaller abdomen make up the extremely reduced body of the pycnogonid, which has up to two pairs of dorsally located simple eyes on its non-calcareous exoskeleton, though sometimes the eyes can be missing, especially among species living in the deep oceans. The abdomen does not have any appendages, and in most species it is reduced and almost vestigial. The organs of this chelicerate extend throughout many appendages because its body is too small to accommodate all of them alone. The morphology of the sea spider creates an extremely well suited surface-area to volume ratio for any respiration to occur through direct diffusion. Oxygen is absorbed by the legs and is transported via the hemolymph to the rest of the body. The most recent research seems to indicate that waste leaves the body through the digestive tract or is lost during a moult. The small, long, thin pycnogonid heart beats vigorously at 90 to 180 beats per minute, creating substantial blood pressure. The beating of the sea spider heart drives circulation in the trunk and in the part of the legs closest to the trunk, but is not important for the circulation in the rest of the legs. Hemolymph circulation in the legs is mostly driven by the peristaltic movement in the part of the gut that extends into every leg. These creatures possess an open circulatory system as well as a nervous system consisting of a brain which is connected to two ventral nerve cords, which in turn connect to specific nerves. Reproduction and development All pycnogonid species have separate sexes, except for one species that is hermaphroditic. Females possess a pair of ovaries, while males possess a pair of testes located dorsally in relation to the digestive tract. Reproduction involves external fertilisation after \\"a brief courtship\\". Only males care for laid eggs and young. The larva has a blind gut and the body consists of a head and its three pairs of cephalic appendages only: the chelifores, palps and s. The abdomen and the thorax with its thoracic appendages develop later. One theory is that this reflects how a common ancestor of all arthropods evolved; starting its life as a small animal with a pair of appendages used for feeding and two pairs used for locomotion, while new segments and segmental appendages were gradually added as it was growing. At least four types of larvae have been described: the typical protonymphon larva, the encysted larva, the atypical protonymphon larva, and the attaching larva. The typical protonymphon larva is most common, is free living and gradually turns into an adult. The encysted larva is a parasite that hatches from the egg and finds a host in the shape of a polyp colony where it burrows into and turns into a cyst, and will not leave the host before it has turned into a young juvenile. Little is known about the development of the atypical protonymphon larva. The adults are free living, while the larvae and the juveniles are living on or inside temporary hosts such as polychaetes and clams. When the attaching larva hatches it still looks like an embryo, and immediately attaches itself to the ous legs of the father, where it will stay until it has turned into a small and young juvenile with two or three pairs of walking legs ready for a free-living existence. Distribution and ecology A pycnogonid in its natural habitat These animals live in many different parts of the world, from Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific coast of the United States, to the Mediterranean Sea and the Caribbean Sea, to the north and south poles. They are most common in shallow waters, but can be found as deep as , and live in both marine and estuarine habitats. Pycnogonids are well camouflaged beneath the rocks and among the algae that are found along shorelines. Sea spiders either walk along the bottom with their stilt-like legs or swim just above it using an umbrella pulsing motion.Deep-Sea News: Sea Spiders Sea spiders are mostly carnivorous predators or scavengers that feed on cnidarians, sponges, polychaetes, and bryozoans. Although they can feed by inserting their proboscis into sea anemones, which are much larger, most sea anemones survive this ordeal, making the sea spider a parasite rather than a predator of anemones. Classification The class Pycnogonida comprises over 1,300 species, which are normally split into eighty-six genera. The correct taxonomy within the group is uncertain, and it appears that no agreed list of orders exists. Accordingly, families are listed in the taxobox, all considered part of the single order Pantopoda. Sea spiders have long been considered to belong to the Chelicerata, together with horseshoe crabs, and the Arachnida, which includes spiders, mites, ticks, scorpions, and harvestmen, among other, lesser-known orders. A competing theory proposes that pycnogonida belong to their own lineage, distinct from chelicerates, crustaceans, myriapods, or insects. This theory contends that the sea spider's chelifores, which are unique among extant arthropods, are not in any way homologous to the chelicerae in real chelicerates, as was previously supposed. Instead of developing from the deutocerebrum, they can be traced to the protocerebrum, the anterior part of the arthropod brain and found in the first head segment that in all other arthropods give rise to the eyes only. This is not found anywhere else among arthropods, except in some fossil forms like Anomalocaris, indicating that the Pycnogonida may be a sister group to all other living arthropods, the latter having evolved from some ancestor that had lost the protocerebral appendages. If this is confirmed, it would mean the sea spiders are the last surviving (and highly modified) members of an ancient stem group of arthropods that lived in Cambrian oceans. However, a subsequent study using Hox gene expression patterns consistent with a developmental homology between chelicerates and chelifores, with chelifores innervated from a deuterocerebrum that has been rotated forwards; thus, the protocerebral Great Appendage clade does not include the Pycnogonida.Pharyngula Recent work places the Pycnogonida outside the Arachnomorpha as basal Euarthropoda, or inside Chelicerata (based on the chelifore-chelicera putative homology).

The earliest fossils are known from the Cambrian 'Orsten' of Sweden, the Silurian Wenlock Series of England and the Devonian Hunsr√ºck Slate of Germany. Some of these specimens are significant in that they possess a longer 'trunk' behind the abdomen and in two fossils the body ends in a tail; something never seen in living sea spiders. In 2013, the first fossil pycnogonid found within an Ordovician deposit was reported from William Lake in northern Manitoba. In 2007, remarkably well preserved fossils were exposed in fossil beds at La Voulte-sur-Rh√¥ne, south of Lyon in south-eastern France. Researchers from the University of Lyon discovered about 70 fossils from three distinct species in the 160-million-year-old Jurassic La Voulte . The find will help fill in an enormous gap in the history of these creatures.

The guitarist and sole songwriter has been the only constant member in a series of lineup changes, and the band's material is released on his own record label Midi:Nette. History March 19, 2002, approximately three months after Malice Mizer announced their indefinite hiatus, Mana announced the formation of his solo project, Moi dix Mois. Their first single, \\"Dialogue Symphonie\\", was released October 19 of the same year. Moi dix Mois played their first concerts outside Japan in March 2005 in Munich, Germany and Paris, France as part of their Invite to Immorality Tour. After the tour's final show on April 24, 2005 in Tokyo, singer Juka left the band. A new phase of the band began on March 1, 2006, when they released the album, Beyond the Gate. This featured a new vocalist named Seth. Before the album was released, Mana indicated that the sound would be the beginning of a renewed direction for the band, possibly more integrated towards electronic music. After the announcement of the Beyond the Gate release was made, Seth was revealed as the new vocalist, and it was announced that Kazuno (bass) and Tohru (drums) were both leaving the group. In June 2006, Moi dix Mois headlined the Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig, Germany. They then returned to touring in Japan. A prospective five city tour in the United States was scheduled for July 2006, but cancelled due to the band citing \\"differences in policies\\" with the tour organizer; however, Mana did make a U.S. appearance at the 2006 Anime Expo in Anaheim, CA on July 1, where he announced that Moi dix Mois was planning to tour America sometime \\"within the calendar year\\".Cancelled US 2006 Tour However, this US tour did not materialize in 2006. On March 28, 2007, they released their fourth album, Dixanadu, the first with the current lineup. On December 27, 2008, Moi dix Mois held the Dis Inferno Vol.VI ~Last Year Party~, where they played a session gig along with Mana's fellow Malice Mizer guitarist K√∂zi. They performed at Anime Expo 2009, the largest anime convention in North America, on July 2 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Also in July they went on a short two-gig coupling tour with K√∂zi called Deep Sanctuary, playing on the 17 in Osaka and the 19 in Tokyo. At the V-Rock Festival '09 on October 24, Moi Dix Mois played two new songs, \\"Dead Scape\\" and \\"The Sect\\", and a new version of \\"The Prophet\\". In July 2010, they went on another tour with K√∂zi, titled Deep Sanctuary II, this time with Malice Mizer bassist Yu~ki as a special guest at Akasaka Blitz on the 17. This was the first time in 9 years that the three Malice Mizer members were on stage together. Moi dix Mois' fifth album, D+Sect, was released on December 15, 2010. Moi dix Mois at Sakura-Con 2012. On August 27, 2011, Mana announced that Moi dix Mois will be releasing a compilation album as part of their 10th anniversary celebration. The album is composed of re-recordings of older songs, from the group's first two albums, by the current line-up. Fans requested which songs were chosen through Mana's blog. The album, titled Reprise, was released on July 11, 2012 and includes the new song \\"Je l'aime\\". On April 7, 2012, Moi dix Mois performed at Sakura- Con 2012 in Seattle, Washington. To celebrate their tenth anniversary, Moi dix Mois held a special concert at Shinjuku Blaze on March 20, 2013. At the end, former members Juka, Kazuno and Tohru reunited with Mana for a one-off performance of the group's original lineup. On May 19, 2014, guitarist K was found dead at his home by relatives. A memorial concert was held on September 15 where Moi dix Mois performed, including the new song \\"Beast Side\\" that was composed in memory of the guitarist. His replacement, Ryux formerly from the band Omega Dripp, was announced by Mana on December 3. Member history Moi dix Mois has experienced numerous lineup changes, with leader and guitarist Mana the only constant member. Vocalist Juka and bassist Kazuno were employed from Moi dix Mois' conception, with Tohru originally a support drummer. Tohru officially joined with the release of \\"Shadows Temple\\" in May 2004. K was introduced as guitarist and \\"death vocalist\\" with the Dis Inferno III event in December 2004. At the end of the Invite to Immorality Tour on April 24, 2005, Juka announced that he would be leaving. A year later, Kazuno and Tohru left with the release of Beyond the Gate. At the same time, Seth was announced as being added to the project as their new vocalist. Sugiya and Hayato provided live support until the release of \\"Lamentful Miss\\", which included them for the first time as full members. After K's death in 2014, he was replaced by Ryux.

The show featured the twist that the \\"leading man\\" did not know that the mix of suitors included both gay and heterosexual men. The show premiered July 29, 2003, on the Bravo cable television channel. A total of six episodes were aired weekly until the finale on September 2, 2003. The show was taped in Palm Springs, California and hosted by Dani Behr. Premise The show featured a gay man named James Getzlaff selecting another man to date from among a group of 15 potential suitors, known as \\"mates\\". Helping him choose was his best friend Andra Stasko. The \\"controversial\\" twist was that some of the housemates were gay, while others were straight. James was not told of this fact until nearly the end of the series' run, and the gay mates were never informed. If James' final choice from among the mates was gay, James and the mate would win a cash prize and a trip for two to New Zealand provided by Alyson Adventures of Key West, Florida, which specializes in gay and lesbian small group tours throughout the world. If James chose a straight mate, James would win nothing and the mate would win $25,000. The producers managed to keep a mixture of gay and straight men in the house despite the eliminations by putting the men into \\"groups\\" that prevented the contestant from eliminating all of the gay men or all of the straight men. At the end of each episode, the sexual orientation of each eliminated mate was revealed to viewers. Contestants { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center - ! Contestant ! Age !

Second season possibilities Boy Meets Boy creator Doug Ross held out hope for a second season. He acknowledged that the popularity of season one would make it practically impossible for another season with the same twist but also said that he has come up with another twist which Bravo executives thought was fun. Speaking in 2007, Bravo executive Frances Berwick pointed to public knowledge of the twist as a stumbling block to a second season, noting the difficulty Bravo had selling the series overseas because of international press reports on the twist. On the possibility of a season two with a new twist, Berwick said, \\"What Bravo does best is to do things first and to really sort of shake up people's preconceptions and notions about things. And we would accept many different formats [for a Boy Meets Boy-type show]. I'm not saying that they wouldn't be as good, because you can always come up with something else. [But] until we find the perfect way to do it...\\" Berwick also suggested that at the time a series as gay-specific as Boy Meets Boy might not have fit into Bravo's overall programming strategy. \\"It has to feel like it's broad enough, and multidimensional enough to work for our incredibly smart audience.\\"Why hasn't there been a second season of Boy Meets Boy? In popular culture Boy Meets Boy was parodied on the ninth season of Mad TV with Getzlaff impersonated by Josh Meyers and Stasko by Michael McDonald. One sketch had a second season of the show called Boy Meets Goy, while recurring sketches had the pair appear on Scare Tactics and then on Hollywood Squares. Boy Meets Boy is also mentioned in the South Park episode \\"South Park Is Gay!\\", which lampoons the metrosexuality and gay reality TV fad. See also * Playing It Straight * Gay, Straight or Taken?

Long in 1820 Historic photo of the High Plains in Haskell County, Kansas, showing a treeless semi-arid grassland and a buffalo wallow or circular depression in the level surface. (Photo by W.D. Johnson, 1897) Darton, N.H. 1920. Syracuse-Lakin folio, Kansas. United States Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, Folios of the Geologic Atlas, No. 212, 10 pp. (See Plate 2) The term Great American Desert was used in the 19th century to describe the western part of the Great Plains east of the Rocky Mountains in North America to about the 100th meridian. It can be traced to the 1820 Stephen H. Long's scientific expedition which put the Great American Desert on the map.The Great American Desert, Digital HistoryWestward Expansion: A History of the American Frontier, by Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge, p. 92. The area is now usually referred to as the High Plains, and the original term is now sometimes used to describe the arid region of North America, which includes parts of northwestern Mexico and the American southwest. The concept of \\"desert\\" In colonial times, the term \\"desert\\" was often used to describe treeless or uninhabited lands whether they were arid or not. By the 19th century, the term had begun to take on its modern meaning. It was long thought that treeless lands were not good for agriculture; thus the term \\"desert\\" also had the connotation of \\"unfit for farming\\". While the High Plains are not a desert in the modern sense, in this older sense of the word they were. The region is mostly semi-arid grassland and steppe. Today much of the region supports agriculture through the use of aquifer water irrigation. But in the 19th century, the area's relative lack of water and wood made it seem unfit for farming and uninhabitable by an agriculturally based people.Welsch, Roger L. The Myth of the Great American Desert, Nebraska History 52 (1971): 255-265. When the region was obtained by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, President Jefferson wrote of the \\"immense and trackless deserts\\" of the region. Zebulon Pike wrote \\"these vast plains of the western hemisphere, may become in time equally celebrated as the sandy deserts of Africa\\". His map included a comment in the region, \\"not a stick of timber\\".Meinig, D.W. (1993). The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History, Volume 2: Continental America, 1800-1867. New Haven: Yale University Press. ; pg. 76 In 1823, Major Stephen Long, a government surveyor and leader of the next official exploration expedition, produced a map labeling the area as the \\"Great American Desert.\\"Major Long and the \\"Great American Desert\\", Kansas Historical Society, 2011 In the report that accompanied the map, the party's geographer Edwin James wrote of the region: > I do not hesitate in giving the opinion, that it is almost wholly unfit for > cultivation, and of course, uninhabitable by a people depending upon > agriculture for their subsistence. Although tracts of fertile land > considerably extensive are occasionally to be met with, yet the scarcity of > wood and water, almost uniformly prevalent, will prove an insuperable > obstacle in the way of settling the country. While many other travelers reported similar conditions and conclusions, there were problems in the interpretation and the use of the word \\"desert\\". By the 19th century, the word had begun to assume its modern sense, evoking images of sandy wastelands. Yet descriptions of the American High Plains almost always included comments about \\"Innumerable Herds of Buffaloes\\", which was written on Pike's map just above \\"not a stick of timber\\". The giant herds and teeming wildlife of the Great Plains were well known by the time the term Great American Desert came into common use, undermining the idea of a wasteland; however, the relevant concept inherent in the reports of the region was that it could not be farmed, something the reports generally agreed on. By the middle of the 19th century, as settlers migrated across the plains to Oregon and California, the wasteland connotation of \\"desert\\" was seen to be false, but the sense of the region as uninhabitable remained until irrigation, railroad transportation, and barbed wire made up for the lack of surface water and wood. Settlement and development The region's relative lack of water and wood affected the development of the United States. Settlers heading westward often attempted to pass through the region as quickly as possible en route to what was considered to be better land farther west. These early settlers gave telling names to the various streams of the region, such as \\"Sweetwater Creek\\" or \\"Poison Creek\\". Because it was not considered desirable, the area became one of the last strongholds of independent American Indians. Railroad interests seeking rights-of-way through the region also benefited from the popular belief that the land was commercially valueless. By the mid-19th century, people had begun settling in the region despite its poor reputation. The local inhabitants came to realize the area was at the time well suited for farming, due in part to the fact that large portions of the region sit atop one of the world's largest groundwater reservoirs, the Ogallala Aquifer. Experts of the era proposed theories that maintained the earlier reports had been accurate and the climate had changed. Some even credited the settlers themselves as having caused the change by planting crops and trees. The slogan \\"rain follows the plow\\" was created to describe this belief. Today these theories are discredited. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that while there is an abundant amount of fossil water in the Ogallala Aquifer, it is slow to replenish itself, with most of the water in the Aquifer having been there since the last Ice Age. Some current estimates predict the usefulness of the Aquifer for agriculture to subside and be useless as soon as the early parts of the mid-21st century, leading current farmers to turn away from irrigated agriculture using the aquifer. In popular culture Mark Twain's Roughing It (1872) mentions the Great American Desert in Chapters 20 and 27. A Study in Scarlet (1887) by Arthur Conan Doyle contains a reference to a \\"desert\\" in the center of North AmericaA Study in Scarlet (1887), by A. Conan Doyle. PART II.

The first creation for the Villiers family was created in 1623 and took its name from the city of Coventry. It became extinct in 1687. A decade later, the second creation was for the Coventry family and is still extant. History=Earls of Coventry, first creation (1623) The earldom of Coventry was created for the first time in 1623, in the Peerage of England, in favour of George Villiers, 1st Marquess of Buckingham. He was made Duke of Buckingham at the same time. The title became extinct in 1687 upon the death of the George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Earls of Coventry, second creation (1697) The earldom of Coventry was created a second time in 1697, again in the Peerage of England, in favour of Thomas Coventry, 5th Baron Coventry. The Coventry family descends from John Coventry who served as Lord Mayor of London in 1426. His descendant Sir Thomas Coventry was a noted early 17th century lawyer and politician. He served as Solicitor General, as Attorney General and as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. In 1628 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Coventry, of Aylesborough in the County of Worcester. He was succeeded by his son from his first marriage, the second Baron. He represented Droitwich and Worcester in the House of Commons. His eldest son, the third Baron, served as Custos Rotulorum of Worcestershire. His son, the fourth Baron, died unmarried and was succeeded by his uncle, the fifth Baron. He sat as Member of Parliament for Droitwich, Camelford and Warwick. In 1697 he was made Viscount Deerhurst, of the hundred of Deerhurst in the County of Gloucester, and Earl of Coventry, with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to 1) the heirs male of his deceased uncle the Hon. Francis Coventry (1612‚Äì1680), failing which to 2) his three second cousins William Coventry, Thomas Coventry and Henry Coventry, grandsons of his deceased great-uncle Walter Coventry (d. 1640), younger brother of the first Baron Coventry. The titles were in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was Custos Rotulorum of Worcestershire. His son, the third Earl, died as a child and was succeeded by his uncle, the fourth Earl. He had no sons and on his death in 1719 the barony of Coventry became extinct. He was succeeded in the viscountcy and earldom according to the special remainders by his second cousin once removed William Coventry, the fifth Earl. He was the grandson of Walter Coventry, youngest brother of the first Baron. Lord Coventry had earlier represented Bridport in Parliament and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the sixth Earl. He sat as Tory Member of Parliament for Bridport and for Worcestershire and served as Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. Croome Court, the ancestral seat of the Coventry family His son from his first marriage, the seventh Earl, was also Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the eighth Earl. He represented Worcester in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. He was succeeded by his grandson, the ninth Earl, who held the title for 87 years. He was the son of George William Coventry, Viscount Deerhurst (1808‚Äì1838). Lord Coventry was a Conservative politician and held office under Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms and as Master of the Buckhounds. He also held the honorary post of Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. He was succeeded by his grandson, the tenth Earl, the son of George William Coventry, Viscount Deerhurst (1865‚Äì1927), eldest son of the ninth Earl. Lord Coventry was killed in action in the Battle of Wytschaete on 27 May 1940, during the BEF's retreat to Dunkirk. He is buried in the cemetery at Givenchy-l√®s-la-Bass√©e. He was succeeded by his only son, the eleventh Earl, who had a varied career and despite four marriages, died without surviving male issue in 2002. He was succeeded by his 89-year-old first cousin once removed, the twelfth Earl. He was the second but eldest surviving son of Colonel the Hon. Charles John Coventry, second son of the ninth Earl. He had one daughter but no sons and the direct male line of descent from the eighth Earl failed upon his death in 2004. He was succeeded by a distant kinsman, the thirteenth and (as of 2016) present holder of the titles. He is the great- great-grandson of the Hon. William James Coventry, the younger son of the seventh Earl. Lord Coventry lives in Canada. Several other members of the Coventry family may be mentioned. The Hon. Henry Coventry (1618‚Äì1686), a son from the second marriage of the first Baron, was Member of Parliament for Droitwich. Another son from the second marriage of the first Baron, Sir William Coventry (d. 1686), represented Great Yarmouth in the House of Commons and became an influential politician. Sir John Coventry (c. 1636‚Äì1685), son of the Hon. John Coventry, a son from the second marriage of the first Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. Thomas Henry Coventry, Viscount Deerhurst (1721‚Äì1744), eldest son and heir apparent of the fifth Earl, briefly represented Bridport in Parliament before his premature death. The ancestral seat of the Coventry family is Croome Court, near Pershore in Worcestershire. Croome Court was sold in 1949 and the family moved to the smaller, half-timbered, somewhat confusingly named Earls Croome Court on the estate, while still retaining most of the Coventry agricultural and forestry estate. Earls Croome Court remained as the seat of the family until 2007, when it was sold by Rachel, Countess of Coventry, the widow of the 11th Earl who died in 2002. The park at Croome Court was handed over to the National Trust in 1996 but the house itself remains private and is now owned by the Croome Heritage Trust.

Biography=History During its first three years of activity, the group consisted of Kaya on vocals (ex-Isola) and Hora (ex-Velvet Eden) as keyboardist and programmer. The two originally worked together under the alias Rudolf Steiner until their signing to ex-Malice Mizer guitarist Mana's record label Midi:Nette. Upon their 're-formation', Mana discarded the name Rudolf Steiner and christened the duo \\"Schwarz Stein\\" (pseudo-German for \\"Black Stone\\"). Prior to their name change, two demo tapes (Queen of Decadence and Perfect Garden) had been released. A re-worked version of Perfect Garden was later created as their Midi:Nette debut single. Schwarz Stein went on to release their first full album New Vogue Children in June 2003, the single Current in November of the same year, and then their final album Artificial Hallucination in February 2004. They opened for Moi dix Mois on several occasions, played at various events, and also made a number solo appearances as well. Following their last performance on March 29, 2004, Schwarz Stein officially disbanded due to creative differences between its two members. The band was briefly reunited for the \\"Dis Inferno III: Last Year Party\\" event on December 15, 2004, hosted by their former label Midi:Nette. A collaboration CD, another cell, was released in April 2006, limited to 1000 copies and only available for order through Kaya's official site. This limited edition CD features re-mixed/re-worked versions of Rudolf Steiner's \\"Kuro Ageha\\" as well as two songs from Hora's first CD Inner Universe, making up three of the eight total tracks. In April 2011, both members announced on their respective web sites that Schwarz Stein would reunite for a single show on July 31 at Takadanobaba Area, to celebrate their 10th anniversary of working together. Tickets were also made available to overseas fans via CD Japan. A new mini- album, Recurrence of Hallucination, was also announced.

In December 2009, The Economist named The Crisis of Islamic Civilization one of the Best Books of 2009. In a recent interview with The Diplomat he discussed his views on modern Islamic civilisation. He considers that, as a result of the expansion of Western colonial powers and modernisation over the last 200 years, Islamic civilisation is fast losing its √©lan and has been reduced to two aspects - political and religious - while economic and cultural aspects no longer affect the Muslim world.

It was created in 1690 for Richard Lumley, 2nd Viscount Lumley. He is best remembered as one of the Immortal Seven who invited William of Orange to invade England and depose his father-in-law James II. Lumley had already been created Baron Lumley, of Lumley Castle in the County of Durham, in 1681, and Viscount Lumley, of Lumley Castle in the County of Durham, in 1689. These titles are also in the Peerage of England. The title of Viscount Lumley, of Waterford, was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1628 for his grandfather Sir Richard Lumley, who later fought as a Royalist in the Civil War. Lord Scarbrough was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented East Grinstead and Arundel in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland. His younger brother, the third Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Arundel and Lincolnshire. In 1723 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Saunderson, upon inheriting the estates of his cousin James Saunderson, 1st Earl Castleton. His son, the fourth Earl, served as Cofferer of the Household, as Deputy Earl Marshal of England and as Joint Vice-Treasurer of Ireland. Lord Scarbrough married Barbara Savile, sister and heiress of Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet. The latter bequeathed his substantial properties in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire to his nephew the Hon. Richard Lumley, younger son of Lord and Lady Scarbrough. Scarbrough was succeeded by his eldest son, the fifth Earl. He represented Lincoln in Parliament. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother the aforementioned the Hon. Richard Lumley, the sixth Earl. He also sat as Member of Parliament for Lincoln.

A variation on the Penrose triangle, it is a two-dimensional depiction of a staircase in which the stairs make four 90-degree turns as they ascend or descend yet form a continuous loop, so that a person could climb them forever and never get any higher. This is clearly impossible in three-dimensional Euclidean geometry. The \\"continuous staircase\\" was first presented in an article that the Penroses wrote in 1959, based on the so-called \\"triangle of Penrose\\" published by Roger Penrose in the British Journal of Psychology in 1958. M.C. Escher then discovered the Penrose stairs in the following year and made his now famous lithograph Klimmen en dalen (Ascending and Descending) in March 1960. Penrose and Escher were informed of each other's work that same year. Escher developed the theme further in his print Waterval (Waterfall), which appeared in 1961. In their original article the Penroses noted that \\"each part of the structure is acceptable as representing a flight of steps but the connexions are such that the picture, as a whole, is inconsistent: the steps continually descend in a clockwise direction.\\" History of discovery= The Penroses  Ascending and Descending by M. C. Escher Escher, in the 1950s, had not yet drawn any impossible figures and was not aware of their existence. Roger Penrose had been introduced to Escher's work at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Amsterdam in 1954. He was \\"absolutely spellbound\\" by Escher's work, and on his journey back to England he decided to produce something \\"impossible\\" on his own. After experimenting with various designs of bars overlying each other he finally arrived at the impossible triangle. Roger showed his drawings to his father, who immediately produced several variants, including the impossible flight of stairs. They wanted to publish their findings but did not know in what field the subject belonged. Because Lionel Penrose knew the editor of the British Journal of Psychology and convinced him to publish their short manuscript, the finding was finally presented as a psychological subject. After the publication in 1958 the Penroses sent a copy of the article to Escher as a token of their esteem. While the Penroses credited Escher in their article, Escher noted in a letter to his son in January 1960 that he was: Escher was captivated by the endless stairs and subsequently wrote a letter to the Penroses in April 1960: At an Escher conference in Rome in 1985, Roger Penrose said that he had been greatly inspired by Escher's work when he and his father discovered both the Penrose tribar structure (that is, the Penrose triangle) and the continuous steps.  Oscar Reutersv√§rd  The staircase design had been discovered previously by the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersv√§rd, but neither Penrose nor Escher was aware of his designs. Inspired by a radio programme on Mozart's method of composition‚Äîdescribed as \\"creative automatism\\", that is, each creative idea written down inspired a new idea‚ÄîReutersv√§rd started to draw a series of impossible objects on a journey from Stockholm to Paris in 1950 in the same \\"unconscious, automatic\\" way. He did not realize that his figure was a continuous flight of stairs while drawing, but the process enabled him to trace his increasingly complex designs step by step. When M.C. Escher's Ascending and Descending was sent to Reutersv√§rd in 1961, he was impressed but didn't like the irregularities of the stairs (). Throughout the 1960s, Reutersv√§rd sent several letters to Escher to express his admiration for his work, but the Dutch artist failed to respond. Roger Penrose only discovered Reutersv√§rd's work in 1984. Escherian Stairwell The Escherian Stairwell is a viral video based on the Penrose stairs illusion. The video, filmed at Rochester Institute of Technology by Michael Lacanilao, was edited to create a seemingly cyclic stairwell such that if someone walks in either direction, they will end up where they started. The video claims that the stairwell, whose name evokes M.C. Escher's impossible objects, was built in the 1960s by the fictitious architect Rafael Nelson Aboganda. The video has been considered an Internet hoax, as individuals have travelled to Rochester Institute of Technology to view the staircase.  In popular culture  The Penrose stairs have appeared twice in the movie Inception. The paradox of the illusion can only be achieved in the dream worlds within the film. In the film, the hero descends the stairs fleeing from a guard. In the real world, the hero should always be in front of the villain throughout this chase. However, in the case of the Penrose stairs the hero descends another flight of stairs to catch up to the villain and catch him off guard.

Although it originated in Norway, it is also produced in Ohio and Ireland under licenses from Norwegian dairy producers. Description Jarlsberg cheese has a yellow wax rind (outer layer) and a semi-firm yellow interior. It is a mild, buttery cheese. The flavor has been described as \\"clean and rich, with a slightly sweet and nutty flavour\\". It is an all-purpose cheese, used for both cooking and eating as a snack. It has a characteristic smooth, shiny-yellow body, and a creamy supple texture. It is aged a minimum of three months and is distinguished by medium to large holes. Some variations are aged a minimum of 9, 12 or 15 months. It is usually produced in 10 kg wheels with an approximate diameter of 330 mm and a height of 95‚Äì105 mm. The characteristic holes or \\"eyes\\" are the result of the action of the bacteria Propionibacterium freudenreichii which naturally occurs in milk and is added back into the cheese during production according to a closely guarded secret formula. History The history of this cheese can be traced back to the middle 1850s. Anders Larsen Bakke (1815‚Äì1899), a farmer and pioneer in Norway's dairy industry, produced cheese in the village of V√•le in what was then the county of Jarlsberg and Larviks Amt (now Vestfold), south of Oslo. The cheese shares similarities with Emmental, introduced to Vestfold by Swiss cheese makers during the 1830s. The cheese was first noted in the annual county report of Jarlsberg and Larviks Amt in 1855. After several years of popularity marked by a large volume of production Jarlsberg disappeared from the market. Modern Jarlsberg cheese was developed in 1956 by Ole Martin Ystgaard of the Dairy Institute at the Agricultural University of Norway. Ystgaard's interest was sparked by the thesis of a dairy sciences student, Per Sakshaug, on the cheese historically made in Vestfold. It was named for a Norwegian nobleman, Count Wedel Jarlsberg, who owned land near Oslo in an area where an earlier version of the cheese was produced in the early 1800s, or for the eponymous county. The recipe was developed from formulae originating with Swiss cheesemakers who moved to Norway at that time. Production and distribution \\"Jarlsberg\\" is a trademark first registered by Tine SA in 1972, and the exact nature and formula for the process of making Jarlsberg cheese is a trade secret. The largest producer of Jarlsberg cheese is Tine SA. Tine is the largest Norwegian dairy product cooperative. Jarlsberg cheese accounts for 80% of Tine's total exports. Tine's United States subsidiary, Norseland, has sold 150 million wheels of Jarlsberg cheese in the U.S. . Jarlsberg cheese was introduced in the United States in 1964. Imports to the U.S. in 1965 were . Since 1979 imports to the U.S. have been limited to . Jarlsberg is the most popular imported cheese in the U.S. , of Jarlsberg cheese was made in the U.S. in Ohio.

Most items are designed in house at their head office, but some countries hold exclusive designs relevant to their market. Oakley currently holds more than 600 patents for eyewear, materials, and performance gear. History Oakley was started by James Jannard in 1975 in his garage with an initial investment of $300. The name \\"Oakley\\" came from Jim's English Setter, \\"Oakley Anne\\". Jannard began by selling what he called 'The Oakley Grip' out of the back of his car at motocross events. His motorcycle grips were unlike other grips available at the time. The material is still used to make the earsocks on Oakley glasses, and many of the nose pieces and now the bands of their watches. Oakley went on to produce number plates, gloves, grips, elbow guards, chin guards, and goggles for the BMX and motocross communities. In 1980, Jannard released a pair of goggles called the O-Frame. With the 'Oakley' logo present on the strap, the brand garnered increasing recognition and prominence throughout the sports industry. In 1983, Oakley began selling ski goggles. The first Oakley sunglasses; Factory Pilot Eyeshades, were sport-oriented, resembling goggles and were released in 1984. These were followed in 1985 by the Oakley Frogskin, a casual sunglass style that was made in Japan. The company went public in 1995, raising $230 million. In early 1996, Oakley had a pricing dispute with Italian company Luxottica, the world's largest eyewear manufacturers and retailers. Luxottica stopped carrying Oakley's products in their stores, including Sunglass Hut, and Oakley's stock market value declined 33%. In 2001, Oakley bought Iacon, Inc., operator of mall-based sunglasses stores Sunglass Designs, Sporting Eyes, and Occhiali da Sole. Oakley signed a four-year agreement to manufacture eyewear designed by themselves and Fox Racing in September 2004.\\"Fox Racing Signs Sunglasses Deal With Oakley.\\" Bicycle Retailer. September 7, 2004 April, 2012 Starting in 2004, Jannard bought large quantities of Oakley stock: $2 million in 2004, $16 million in 2005, and $4.6 million in early 2006, bringing his personal stake in the company to 63%. In 2006, Oakley acquired the Oliver Peoples group, a manufacturer of high-end fashion branded eyewear (under the Oliver Peoples, Mosley Tribes, and Paul Smith brands) for $55.7m, and Optical Shop of Aspen, a luxury eyewear retailer with fourteen stores. On June 21, 2007, Luxottica announced a plan to purchase Oakley in a cash deal worth $2.1 billion, paying a 16% premium over the extant share price. The deal was completed on November 15, 2007, making Oakley part of a portfolio that includes brands such as Ray-Ban, Persol, and Vogue. After selling Oakley Inc. to Italian Eyeware company Luxottica Group in 2007, founder James Jannard went on to found Red Digital Cinema. Luxottica's acquisition of Oakley has been criticized as potential violation of Antitrust laws. During the preparations for the ultimately successful rescue of thirty-three miners trapped for ten weeks in a Chilean mine in October 2010, a journalist covering the story contacted Oakley about donating sunglasses to the rescue effort, aware that the miners would need eye protection after having spent weeks in darkness. Oakley donated 35 pairs of its Radar sports glasses, fitted with specially selected tints. A pair of Oakley sunglasses Oakley sponsored members of the US Olympic Team in 2012, and that same year, extended the partnership through 2020. In August 2013, Oakley sold its REVO brand to Sequential Brands for $20m. In September 2015, Oakley shutdown the website of its outlet arm Oakley Vault, while continuing its brick and mortar retail presence of the brand. Technical innovation Most of Oakley's technological designs, fashion pieces, gear, etc. were developed with extensive athlete input and testing in the field ‚Äì including extreme conditions. Oakley also maintains US Standard Issue, which provides U.S. military and law enforcement eye protection. Oakley M Frame sunglasses are included as part of the U.S. Army's Authorized Protective Eyewear List (APEL), and have been assigned a National Stock Number (NSN) for ordering through military supply channels. The company has also built at least one 'golf hovercraft', demonstrated as an all terrain replacement for conventional golf carts. This hovercraft was created for marketing purposes, in partnership with the professional golfer, Bubba Watson.

Little is known about the role they played in Greek social life, but they existed from the Greek Dark Ages until the 2nd century BCE. Ancient Greece The nature of the Greek phratries is, in the words of one historian, \\"the darkest problem among the [Greek] social institutions.\\" Homer refers to them several times, in passages that appear to describe the social environment of his times. In Athens, enrollment in a phratry seems to have been the basic requirement for citizenship in the state before the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BCE. From their peak of prominence in the Greek Dark Ages, when they appear to have been a substantial force in Greek social life, phratries gradually declined in significance throughout the classical period as other groups (such as political parties) gained influence at their cost. Phratries contained smaller kin groups called gene; these appear to have arisen later than phratries, and it appears that not all members of phratries belonged to a genos; membership in these smaller groups may have been limited to elites. On an even smaller level, the basic kinship group of ancient Greek societies was the oikos (household). Anthropology In anthropology, the Greek term is used to describe a unilineal descent group composed of a number of supposedly related clans which each retain their separate identities, but each feels some sort of special identity to the others within its phratry. A phratry may be formed when a clan grows so large that it splits up without losing their original (identity) connection. Among Native Americans, a phratry is often identified by a nature sign. In some cultures, such as the Tlingit, and the Lenape, intermarriage between phratries was mandated. Traditionally, the social organisation of Marind-anim, a tribal group in southern Irian in the island of New Guinea, is made out of exogamic phratries (Marind term boan).

He has been an active member of the Iraqi National List (headed by Iyad Allawi) and has fought hard for political reconciliation among Iraq's political parties as well as against the policy of de-Ba'athification, since his resignation as Minister of Electricity. Previously, he was a prominent member of the Iraqi Opposition and lived in exile in the U.S. for over 30 years. Family, childhood, and education Alsammarae was born on 5 July 1951 to a prominent Sunni Muslim family in Baghdad, Iraq, the second youngest of 13 children. His father, Jasim, was born and raised in Samarra. He later founded one of Iraq's largest construction companies. From a young age, Alsammarae was intimately familiar with Iraqi politics due to his family's presence in this sphere. Many of his close relatives served as ambassadors, cabinet advisors, and members of parliament. Growing up in the 1960s, Alsammarae received his primary and secondary education in Baghdad, Iraq. He then attended the University of Baghdad, earning his BSc in Electrical Engineering in 1973. Upon obtaining his bachelor's degree, he completed his obligatory military duty (required of all men over the age of 18 in Iraq) by serving in the Air Force. After completing this requirement, Alsammarae received a scholarship to obtain post-graduate education in the U.S.. He obtained his Masters in Electrical Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, IL in 1978 and began work on his PhD By 1980, Alsammarae had resigned from the Ba'ath Party, and his scholarship to complete his PhD was revoked. In order to complete his studies at IIT, he worked as a teaching assistant and was able to continue with his education, obtaining his PhD in Electrical Engineering in 1983. After graduation, Alsammarae resided and worked in Chicago, IL as an electrical engineer while also becoming active in the Iraqi opposition. During the 1990s, he became involved with Iraqi charity organizations, sending food, clothing and medicine to those in need in Iraq. Alsammarae was involved in opposition meetings during the 1990s and leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2003 he was elected as Minister of Electricity and increased electricity production to the highest level seen since the invasion in 2003, despite insurgent attacks, an archaic electrical system, lack of fuel for generators, and lack of qualified personnel. Early political career Alsammarae was a member of the Iraqi Ba'ath Party during the 1970s while a young college student in Baghdad, Iraq and was required to remain a Ba'ath Party member in order to obtain a scholarship to continue his studies in the USA. In January 1980, Alsammarae resigned from the party upon news of the execution of two brothers- in-law and one cousin. All three men had been accused of planning a coup attempt against Saddam Hussein; Alsammarae was later implicated in the alleged coup attempt by Iraqi Intelligence officials. Upon resignation from the Ba'ath Party, Alsammarae became active in the Iraqi opposition as well as numerous Iraqi charity and humanitarian groups. In the 1990s, Alsammarae was elected to serve as national board member in the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee and used his role to work on behalf of those suffering under economic sanctions in Iraq. In addition to giving numerous lectures on the detrimental effects of the sanctions on the population of Iraq, Alsammarae organized numerous humanitarian shipments of food, clothing and medicine to Iraq. Alsammarae at the White House (September 2003) In 2002, the US brought numerous Iraqi opposition groups and active opposition members together to discuss the potential for a post-Saddam Iraq. Alsammarae was in attendance at these meetings, and was elected by fellow opposition members to be one of the 65 members of the Coordinating Committee. At these meetings, he advocated the establishment of a secular, democratic Iraq within its currently defined borders. He was strongly opposed to the creation of an Iraqi federation as well as de-Ba'athifaction, both of which were policies put forth by Ahmed Chalabi. Alsammarae has criticized Chalabi's policies and behavior in many instances, including a Washington Times article where Alsammarae denounced Chalabi's move to a former Hussein palace. Such criticism, though supported by many Iraqi politicians, has rendered Chalabi a relentless political enemy to Alsammarae, and a web page deriding Alsammarae can be found on Chalabi's political party website. Minister of Electricity Aiham Alsammarae at the Opening Ceremony of the Baiji Power Plant In August 2003, Alsammarae was appointed to serve as Minister of Electricity under the Coalition Provisional Authority by Paul Bremer and was the first minister of electricity in post- Saddam Iraq. Alsammarae inherited an archaic system providing an output of around 3,000MW (whereas demand is at minimum, 9,000 MW). Additionally, the national grid suffered from daily attacks and theft, lack of manpower and fuel shortages (despite developing new power plants and refurbishing old ones, the Ministry of Oil refused to give the Ministry of Electricity the oil necessary to fuel the power plants). In 2003 and 2004, Alsammarae complained about the lack of fuel on numerous occasions and tried to involve external mediation to solve the loggerhead. Unfortunately, he was unable to encourage the Ministry of Oil to supply fuel to the Ministry of Electricity and this situation persists and remains a problem for the Ministry of Electricity today. Despite the numerous problems Alsammarae faced in modernizing Iraq's electrical system, the electrical output observed during Alsammarae's leadership has not since, been matched. In fact, since his departure from the ministry, electricity generation steadily declined to hit all-time lows in October 2006, a full year and a half after he left office. Furthermore, according to current Minister of Electricity, Kareem Waheed, the ministry is still \\"...working on projects [started] by Dr. Alsammarae\\". In addition to his work in the ministry, Alsammarae spearheaded efforts towards reconciliation with Iraqi insurgent groups, in an attempt to get them to lay down their arms and join the political fold. Alsammarae reached out to \\"..11 separate Iraqi resistance groups, and at least four of the most important resistance groups --- including the Ba'athist Jaish Muhammad - gave him a formal letter declaring their willingness to pursue talks with Washington and the interim regime in Baghdad\\". Additionally, Alsammarae worked hard to lobby the Iraqi parliament and other Iraqi politicians to reject Chalabi's policy of de-ba'athification. The policy stated that anyone who was a previous Ba'ath Party Member would be ineligible to serve in the current Iraqi regime. This meant that all public servants, including the police and army, were fired over night. Chalabi was able to garner enough support to push the policy through, and enact it into law in 2003; however as of 2009, Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki revoked the law and called for reconciliation efforts, instead. Post Ministry Alsammarae resigned from the Ministry in May 2005 as Ibrahim Al-Jafari, an Iraqi politician with strong ties to Iran was elected as Prime Minister. Alsammarae remained active in political pursuits such as garnering further support for reconciliation as well as encouraging Sunni's to be more active in politics. However, in the face of growing Iranian control over Iraq, Alsammarae began to openly criticize the Iranian regime, its presence in Iraq and the Iraqi politicians allied to Iran. This criticism would make him the target of an assassination attempt in January 2006, which resulted in two of his body guards sustaining critical injuries, requiring they be rushed to Amman, Jordan for treatment. The attempt failed, but was followed with charges of corruption leaked to the media by the Iraqi government. Details of the charges are scant, and to date, no Iraqi Government spokesman has revealed any information concerning the charges Alsammarae faced. According to the Chicago Tribune, Alsammarae heard of these charges while he was at his home in Amman, Jordan. He decided to travel to face these charges, but found that he would, instead, be held without being formally charged by the Commission for Public Integrity. The CPI is heavily criticized by Iraqi politicians, with many, such as Massoud Barazani (Governor of Kurdistan), declaring that the CPI is a tool for political retribution and the \\"...settling of political scores\\". Furthermore, the head of the CPI was, himself, accused of corruption by the Iraqi Parliament. Regardless, on 11 October 2006 Alsammarae was convicted of misappropriation of funds regarding a $200,000 generator purchased for the southern province of Maysan. He filed an appeal, and was acquitted of wrongdoing in December 2006. Unfortunately, he was not let out of detainment, and instead was told that he would be taken outside the green zone for finger printing before he would be released. Meanwhile, records show that his family repeatedly contacted the State Department and Senators from their home state of Illinois, asking that they look into his case. On 16 October 2006, Obama's Senate office received a faxed plea from Alsammarae's son, Ramy Alsammarae. \\"Alsammarae's son claimed in the fax that his father was railroaded for exposing Iraqi government incompetence, and feared his life was in danger.\\" Fearing his safety outside the green zone and cleared of wrongdoing, Alsammarae escaped the unlawful detention and traveled to Amman, Jordan and back to the United States. Alsammarae, who has been cleared of all allegations and acquitted by the highest appeals court in Iraq, has continued his work in Iraqi politics. He is currently working with the Iraqi National List, headed by Iyad Allawi. He has concentrated his work on continuing efforts in the area of reconciliation and is actively working to bring Iraqis of various ethnic and religious backgrounds together to form one, nationalistic, secular and democratic front. Personal life Alsammarae is CEO of a private engineering consulting firm and lives in Chicago, Illinois, with his wife and three children.

It is named after the Japanese general Tomoyuki Yamashita, nicknamed \\"The Tiger of Malaya\\". Though accounts that the treasure remains hidden in the Philippines have lured treasure hunters from around the world for over fifty years, its existence is dismissed by most experts.Asian Pacific Post, \\"Searching for the lost treasure of Yamashita\\" (Wednesday, August 24, 2005) Access date: January 10, 2007. \\"Enduring Myths by Ambeth R. Ocampo (January 17, 2004)\\" Access date: December 6, 2007. The rumored treasure was the subject of a complex lawsuit that was filed in a Hawaiian state court in 1988 involving a Filipino treasure hunter, Rogelio Roxas, and the former Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos. Looting of gold Prominent among those who have argued for the existence of Yamashita's gold are Sterling Seagrave and his wife Peggy Seagrave, who wrote two books related to the subject: The Yamato Dynasty: The Secret History of Japan's Imperial Family (2000) and Gold Warriors: America's Secret Recovery of Yamashita's Gold (2003). The Seagraves contend that looting was organized on a massive scale, by both yakuza gangsters such as Yoshio Kodama, and the highest levels of Japanese society, including Emperor Hirohito.Chalmers Johnson, \\"The Looting of Asia\\" ; review of Gold Warriors, London Review of Books v. 25, no. 22 (November 20, 2003) The Japanese government intended that loot from Southeast Asia would finance Japan's war effort. The Seagraves allege that Hirohito appointed his brother, Prince Yasuhito Chichibu, to head a secret organization named Kin no yuri (\\"Golden Lily\\"), for this purpose. It is purported that many of those who knew the locations of the loot were killed during the war, or later tried by the Allies for war crimes and executed or incarcerated. Yamashita himself was convicted of war crimes and executed by the U.S. Army on February 23, 1946, in Los Ba√±os, Laguna, the Philippines. The stolen property reportedly included many different kinds of valuables looted from banks, depositories, other commercial premises, museums, private homes, and religious buildings. It takes its name from General Tomoyuki Yamashita, who assumed command of the Japanese forces in the Philippines in 1944. According to various accounts, the loot was initially concentrated in Singapore, and later transported to the Philippines. The Japanese hoped to ship the treasure from the Philippines to the Japanese Home Islands after the war ended. As the War in the Pacific progressed, U.S. Navy submarines and Allied warplanes inflicted increasingly heavy sinkings of Japanese merchant shipping. Some of the ships carrying the war booty back to Japan were sunk in combat. The Seagraves and a few others have claimed that American military intelligence operatives, including Edward Lansdale, located much of the loot; they colluded with Hirohito and other senior Japanese figures to conceal its existence, and they used it to finance American covert intelligence operations around the world during the Cold War. These rumors have inspired many hopeful treasure hunters, but most experts and Filipino historians say there is no credible evidence behind these claims. In 1992, Imelda Marcos claimed that Yamashita's gold accounted for the bulk of the wealth of her husband, Ferdinand Marcos. Many individuals and consortia, both Philippine and foreign, continue to search for treasure sites. A number of accidental deaths, injuries and financial losses incurred by treasure hunters have been reported.See, for example, Asian Pacific Post, 2005, Ibid and; BBC, \\"WWII Japanese bomb kills Philippines treasure hunters\\" (March 22, 1998). Access date: January 10, 2007. The National Museum of the Philippines is responsible for the issuance of treasure hunting permits and licenses. Treasure skeptics Ricardo Jose, history professor from the University of the Philippines, has questioned the theory that treasure from mainland Southeast Asia was transported to the Philippines: \\"By 1943 the Japanese were no longer in control of the seas... It doesn't make sense to bring in something that valuable here when you know it's going to be lost to the Americans anyway. The more rational thing would have been to send it to Taiwan or China.\\"Asian Pacific Post 2005, Ibid. Philippines National Historical Institute chairman and historian Ambeth Ocampo commented: \\"Two of the wealth myths I usually encounter are the Yamashita treasure and gossip that the Cojuangco fortune was founded on a bag of money...\\" Ocampo also said: \\"For the past 50 years, many people, both Filipinos and foreigners, have spent their time, money and energy in search of Yamashita's elusive treasure.\\" Professor Ocampo noted \\"What makes me wonder is that for the past 50 years, despite all the treasure hunters, their maps, oral testimony and sophisticated metal detectors, nobody has found a thing.\\" Rogelio Roxas lawsuit In March 1988, a Filipino treasure hunter named Rogelio Roxas filed a lawsuit in the state of Hawaii against the former president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda Marcos for theft and human rights abuses. Roxas claimed that in Baguio in 1961 he met the son of a former member of the Japanese army who mapped for him the location of the legendary Yamashita Treasure. Roxas claimed a second man, who served as Yamashita's interpreter during the World War II, told him of visiting an underground chamber there where stores of gold and silver were kept, and who told of a golden buddha kept at a convent located near the underground chambers. Roxas claimed that within the next few years he formed a group to search for the treasure, and obtained a permit for the purpose from a relative of Ferdinand, Judge Pio Marcos. In 1971, Roxas claimed, he and his group uncovered an enclosed chamber on state lands near Baguio City where he found bayonets, samurai swords, radios, and skeletal remains dressed in a Japanese military uniform. Also found in the chamber, Roxas claimed, were a golden-colored Buddha and numerous stacked crates which filled an area approximately 6 feet x 6 feet x 35 feet. He claimed he opened just one of the boxes, and found it packed with gold bullion. He said he took from the chamber the golden Buddha, which he estimated to weigh 1,000 kilograms, and one box with twenty-four gold bars, and hid them in his home. He claimed he resealed the chamber for safekeeping until he could arrange the removal of the remaining boxes, which he suspected were also filled with gold bars. Roxas said he sold seven of the gold bars from the opened box, and sought potential buyers for the golden Buddha. Two individuals representing prospective buyers examined and tested the metal in the Buddha, Roxas said, and reported it was made of solid, 20-carat gold. It was soon after this, Roxas claimed, that President Ferdinand Marcos learned of Roxas' discovery and ordered him arrested, beaten, and the Buddha and remaining gold seized. Roxas alleged that in retaliation to his vocal campaign to reclaim the Buddha and the remainder of the treasure taken from him, Ferdinand continued to have Roxas threatened, beaten and eventually incarcerated for over a year. Following his release, Roxas put his claims against Marcos on hold until Ferdinand lost the presidency in 1986. But in 1988, Roxas and the Golden Budha Corporation, which now held the ownership rights to the treasure Roxas claims was stolen from him, filed suit against Ferdinand and wife Imelda in a Hawaiian state court seeking damages for the theft and the surrounding human rights abuses committed against Roxas. Roxas died on the eve of trial,\\"22-billion award vs. Marcoses reversed\\", Filipino Express, November 29, 1998 but prior to his death he gave the deposition testimony that would be later used in evidence. In 1996, the Roxas estate and the Golden Budha Corporation received what was then-largest judgment ever awarded in history, $22 billion, which with interest increased to $40.5 billion. In 1998, the Hawaii Supreme Court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Roxas found the treasure and that Marcos converted it. However, the court reversed the damage award, holding that the $22 billion award of damages for the chamber full of gold was too speculative, as there was no evidence of quantity or quality, and ordered a new hearing on the value of the golden Buddha and 17 bars of gold only. After several more years of legal proceedings, the Golden Budha Corporation obtained a final judgment against Imelda Marcos to the extent of her interest in the Marcos estate in the principal amount of $13,275,848.37 and Roxas‚Äô estate obtained a $6 million judgment on the claim for human right abuse.See: * \\"Manila Standard Today, Marcos Victims Dying To Get Paid, January 28, 2006\\" * Marcos Torture Victims Entitled to Millions, Ninth Circuit Says, Metropolitan News-Enterprise, May 5, 2006 * Republic of the Philippines v Pimentel, Petition for a Writ for Certiorari, United States Supreme Court * Judge allots $35 million to plaintiffs vs. Marcos Honolulu Star-Bulletin, July 13, 2004 This lawsuit ultimately concluded that Roxas found a treasure, and although the Hawaiian state court was not required to determine whether this particular treasure was the legendary Yamashita‚Äôs gold, the testimony relied upon by the court in reaching its conclusion pointed in that direction. Roxas was allegedly following a map from the son of a Japanese soldier; Roxas allegedly relied on tips provided from Yamashita‚Äôs interpreter; and Roxas allegedly found samurai swords and the skeletons of dead Japanese soldiers in the treasure chamber. All this led the United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal to summarize the allegations leading to Roxas‚Äô final judgment as follows: \\"The Yamashita Treasure was found by Roxas and stolen from Roxas by Marcos' men.\\" In popular culture * Yamashita's gold, though not mentioned by that name, serves as a major plot element of Cryptonomicon, a novel by Neal Stephenson. * A film about the alleged treasure, Yamashita: The Tiger's Treasure, directed by Chito S. Ro√±o was released in the Philippines in 2001.

History Coat of arms of the 3rd Earl of Jersey at Middleton Stoney church, impaled with the arms of Egerton, his in-laws Monument of the 9th Earl of Jersey, showing the family's current arms It was created in 1697 for the statesman Edward Villiers, 1st Viscount Villiers, Ambassador to France from 1698 to 1699 and Secretary of State for the Southern Department from 1699 to 1700. He had already been created Baron Villiers, of Hoo in the County of Kent, and Viscount Villiers, of Dartford in the County of Kent, in 1691, also in the Peerage of England. A member of the prominent Villiers family, he was the grandson of Sir Edward Villiers, brother of Sir William Villiers, 1st Baronet, of Brooksby, and half-brother of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey and John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He represented Kent in the House of Commons from 1705 to 1708. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Earl. In 1766, he succeeded his second cousin John Villiers, 1st Earl Grandison, as sixth Viscount Grandison through a special remainder in the letters patent. His son, the fourth Earl, was a politician and served as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, as Master of the Buckhounds and as Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl. He was a Tory politician and served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household and as Master of the Horse. Lord Jersey married Sarah Sophia (died 1867), daughter of John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, and his wife Sarah Anne (died 1793), daughter of Robert Child. Through this marriage the private bank Child & Co. came into the Villiers family. On account of the considerable wealth brought to the family through this marriage, in 1819, Lord Jersey assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Child, and since then the branch of the family has been known as Child-Villiers. On his death, the titles passed to his son, the sixth Earl. He sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Rochester, Minehead, Honiton and Weymouth and Melcombe Regis and Cirencester. He succeeded in the earldom on 3 October 1859 and died on 24 October 1859, having held the title for only twenty-one days. Lord Jersey married Julia, daughter of Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, in 1841. He was succeeded by his son, the seventh Earl. He served in the second Conservative administration of Lord Salisbury as Paymaster-General from 1889 to 1890 and was Governor of New South Wales from 1890 to 1893. On his death in 1915, the titles passed to his eldest son, the eighth Earl. He served briefly under David Lloyd George as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from January to August 1919. In 1923, he sold Child & Co to Glyn, Mills & Co. His son, the ninth Earl, was a Major in the Royal Artillery (TA). the titles are held by the latter's grandson, the tenth Earl, who succeeded in 1998. He is the eldest son of George Henry Villiers, Viscount Villiers (1948‚Äì1998), eldest son of the ninth Earl. Lord Jersey is an actor, writer and producer, known professionally as William Villiers. The heirs apparent to the earldom alternate the use of the two viscomital titles as their courtesy title. The tenth Earl was briefly styled Viscount Grandison between the deaths of his father, Viscount Villiers, and his grandfather, the ninth Earl, and so the next heir is therefore styled Viscount Villiers. The present family seat is Radier Manor, on the island of Jersey. Previous family seats were Middleton Park in Oxfordshire and Osterley Park in Middlesex. The Earls of Jersey are also in remainder of the title of Duke of Marlborough, for being descendants of one of the daughters of his daughters, by primogeniture, and their heirs male of the 1st Duke. The parish church of All Saints at Middleton Stoney, near Middleton Park, is the burial place of most of the Earls of Jersey. Earl of Clarendon Another member of the family to gain distinction was the Hon. Thomas Villiers, second son of the second Earl. He was created Earl of Clarendon in 1776 (see this title for more information on this branch of the family). Jacobite earldoms of Jersey In April 1716, two Jacobite earldoms of Jersey were created by the Old Pretender, the first for Barbara, n√©e Chiffinch, the widow of the first Earl of the 1697 creation, and the other for their eldest son (who succeeded as second Earl of the 1697 creation) with the subsidiary titles Viscount Dartford and Baron Hoo. The first became extinct on the Countess's death in 1735.

History=Early years: 1996-1998 The band was formed by Miles Kurosky and Bill Swan in San Francisco in 1996, while the pair were both working in the same office. The pair discovered that they shared similar musical tastes and, disregarding some mutual dislike, decided to form a band. This early incarnation of Beulah recorded a song every 6 weeks for 16 months, on their 4-track recorder. The band received attention from The Apples in Stereo frontman and Elephant 6 member Robert Schneider, who expressed interest on releasing what was to be their first single, A Small Cattle Drive in a Snow Storm, on Elephant 6 records. Their first album, Handsome Western States, was released in the same year, also on Elephant 6 and mastered by Schneider. The record soon sold out. This association with the collective has continued throughout their career, despite the fact that they did not release anything more on the label - they are listed as being part of the close family of Elephant 6 bands, on the official Elephant 6 website, and they have toured with other collective members, such as Dressy Bessy, Ladybug Transistor, The Olivia Tremor Control and of Montreal. In order to tour in support of the album, Steve La Follette, Steve St. Cin, and Pat Noel joined the band, with the band playing their first shows in support of the Apples. Middle years: 1999-2002 Their second album, When Your Heartstrings Break, followed two years later to critical acclaim. The sound of the band had shifted ‚Äî as Kurosky put it, the band's production values had shifted \\"from lo-fi to mid-fi\\", and it incorporated a very wide range of instruments, utilising eighteen additional musicians ‚Äî strings and horns were heavily incorporated, along with more exotic instrumentation, the instruments totalling a number of several dozen. Also, at this time, the band added keyboardist Bill Evans to their line-up. Shifty Disco Records, an Oxford, UK based label, also released two UK-only singles in 1999, namely Sunday Under Glass and Score From Augusta, with Emma Blowgun's Last Stand released the following year. These singles featured b-sides culled from Handsome Western States, which remained unreleased in the UK, and had fallen out of print in the U.S., until 2000 further copies were made available by the band in 1999, with different artwork. Emma Blowgun's Last Stand was also released in Australia by Elastic Records, this time with two exclusive bonus tracks. The band continued to tour extensively throughout 1999, taking a break in 2000. Steve St. Cin left the band after this extensive touring, to be replaced by Danny Sullivan, best known from his days in Screeching Weasel. In this time, Kurosky went to Japan, staying with a friend for eight weeks, here writing the songs that would eventually turn into their third album. He then mailed demo tapes of the songs to each band member, who would in turn mail back their own versions of, and additions to, the songs. This process created interesting juxtapositions in the band's songwriting process, as Kurosky describes: \\"Bill might have heard it as a soul song and Pat might have heard it as a country song ‚Äî and I might happen to like both parts, and use them both\\". Kurosky then turned these recordings into the basis of the band's new record, The Coast Is Never Clear. During the recording process, however, Kurosky was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and took daily therapy sessions, which informed the lyrical mood of the record, which was often incredibly downbeat, very much at odds with the breezy, summery feel of the music. This also made the recording of the record difficult ‚Äî Bill Swan's studio diary often contains excerpts such as, \\"Miles threatened to hit me over the head with a mic stand. This is going to be a long record\\". To add to these personal problems, Beulah also encountered other problems with the release of the record, primarily the buy-out of Capricorn Records, which had previously signed Beulah after When Your Heartstrings Break was released, which included the purchase of all of the label's acts save Beulah and three others. In the end, the record was released on newly founded independent label Velocette Records on September 11, 2001. The record again gained a great degree of critical acclaim, and the band continued to tour, despite having to cancel their European dates in the winter of that year. Shortly after the release of the record, Steve La Follette and Bill Evans left the band, to be replaced by Eli Crews and Pat Abernathy. Later years: 2002-2004 2002 saw the then- out-of-print Handsome Western States being repressed for the third time, along with another U.S. tour, after which the band settled into rehearsing material for their next album. The period surrounding Yoko's conception and recording was one of great personal strife for the band - Kurosky separated from his longtime girlfriend, and three of the six band members went through divorce while the record was being written, rehearsed and recorded. Amid all this, the foundations of the band appeared to be shaking; rumours of a break-up were rife and well-founded. The mood of the album was certainly much darker and the band phased back much of their instrumentation, preferring to create more of a live sound than layering multiple overdubs atop the mix. The album took a much rockier direction than their previous efforts; yet, upon its release in 2003, attracted a similar lauding that had greeted their previous two records. An album of demos, appropriately titled Yoko Demos, was released in the December of this year. At this time, Beulah appeared to be falling apart. Cryptic messages alluding to a break-up appeared on the band's website, and the state of the band was in much speculation. Beulah themselves had stated that, if Yoko did not achieve gold status, the band would split. Though it received the best reviews of the band's career, scoring Universal Acclaim on Metacritic and described as a \\"career-spanning epic\\" by Dusted Magazine, the record still failed to achieve gold status, and true to their word the band, after one final tour (with the band dios malos opening for them), split up, ending with a free concert at New York's Battery Park at Castle Clinton on August 5, 2004. On August 2, 2005, a DVD chronicling their last tour in fall 2003, titled A Good Band is Easy to Kill (referring to the band's song \\"A Good Man is Easy to Kill,\\" which, in turn, references lead singer Miles's love for Flannery O'Connor) was released, again to much praise. In 2005, all four Beulah albums, as well as the single \\"My Horoscope Said It Would Be a Bad Year,\\" were released on iTunes after fans suggested they be easily accessible. However, \\"My Horoscope Said It Would Be a Bad Year\\" has since been removed and has become something of a rarity. Miles Kurosky's Desert of Shallow Effects Miles Kurosky released his first solo album (CD/digital),The Desert of Shallow Effects, on March 9, 2010 via Majordomo Records, an imprint of Shout! Factory. The EP was released January 12, 2010 on digital. Produced by Kurosky and engineered by former Beulah member Eli Crews (Deerhoof, Why?), The Desert of Shallow Effects includes a cast of more than two dozen musicians (among them several former Beulah members) playing a vast array of instruments. ‚ÄúWhen I wrote lyrics before, for Beulah, they were of an esoteric nature, but this time, I wanted them to read like stories,‚Äù says Kurosky of the compositions that populate The Desert of Shallow Effects. In late 2009, the members of Beulah reunited to perform selections from The Desert of Shallow Effects for The Bay Bridged festival. The 2009 film Youth in Revolt contained the Beulah song \\"Popular Mechanics for Lovers\\", which appears on the film's soundtrack album.

This grenade has already been detonated. A smoke grenade is a canister-type grenade used as a signaling device, target or landing zone marking device, or as a screening device for unit movements. Smoke grenades generally emit a far larger amount of smoke than smoke bombs, which are a type of fireworks typically started with an external fuse rather than a pin and are more complex. Smoke grenades often cost around compared to smoke bombs, which can often cost just a few cents. The phrase \\"to smoke\\", meaning to fake, bluff, or beat around the bush, comes from the military usage of smoke grenades to obscure and conceal movement. __TOC__  Design  Diagram and cross section of an AN M18 smoke grenade A typical design consists of a sheet steel cylinder with four emission holes on top and one on the bottom to allow smoke release when the grenade is ignited. The filler consists of 250 to 350 grams of colored smoke composition (mostly potassium chlorate, lactose, and a dye) in virtually any color. White smoke grenades typically use hexachloroethane-zinc and granular aluminum. The reaction is exothermic and though they remain intact, smoke grenade casings will often remain scalding hot for some time even after the grenade is no longer emitting smoke. Although modern smoke grenades are designed not to directly emit fire or sparks, they remain a fire hazard and are capable of igniting dry vegetation or flammable substances if used injudiciously. Another type of smoke grenade is the bursting variation. These are filled with white phosphorus (WP), a pyrophoric agent that is spread quickly into a cloud by an internal bursting charge. White phosphorus burns with a brilliant yellow flame while producing copious amounts of white smoke (phosphorus pentoxide). This type of smoke grenade is favored for its ability to produce a very dense and nearly instantaneous cloud of white concealment smoke as compared to the more common solid-filler grenades which expel a slower stream of smoke over a period of roughly 1 minute. For this reason, they are favored for use in onboard grenade launching attachments on armored vehicles, which require extremely fast concealment in the event they are targeted by laser guided anti-tank missiles and need to rapidly retreat.  Use  A violet signaling smoke grenade being used during a military training exercise Smoke grenades are used for several purposes. The primary use is the creation of smoke screens for concealment and the signaling of aircraft. If movement (such as flanking maneuvers or retreat) is necessary, smoke grenades can be thrown prior to movement in order to provide a wall of visual distraction that reduces the accuracy of enemy fire and temporarily deceives them as to the force's location. The most common color for concealment smoke is white or grey. With the advent of infrared imaging goggles which can spot troop movements through smoke screens, the newest smoke compositions now include a \\"multi-spectrum\\" component to make them IR impermeable. Smoke grenades can also be used to signal aircraft. Since locating a target from above (especially in thick forest canopy) can be nearly impossible, even with good radio contact, colored smoke grenades are often used to allow aircraft to spot them. Colored signaling smoke grenades are widely used in CASEVAC and close air support situations where quickly locating friendly ground forces is of paramount importance. Common colors are red, yellow, green and purple, and all use very brightly colored dyes to increase the likelihood of being spotted from above.  Other uses  Amphibious Assault Vehicles firing smoke grenades Smoke grenades are functionally identical to many forms of chemical grenades (such as CS gas riot control grenades) and incendiary grenades (such as thermite grenades) which use a fuse to ignite a solid filler inside a steel canister, which then slowly propels the combustion products out through holes in the canister as the contents burn. However, the smoke grenade class is restricted to signaling and concealment under the laws of war, and thus they are not considered weapons; since the vast majority are non-explosive, they remain legal for civilian use and ownership in most countries. Since the basic design of a smoke grenade (a metal canister containing a substance that burns and expels smoke when ignited) is so simple, improvised devices are ubiquitous across the world. Protestors, football spectators, and airsoft enthusiasts often create their own smoke grenades using common materials.

These are carnivorous marine gastropod molluscs in the family Muricidae, commonly called \\"murexes\\" or \\"rock snails\\".Houart, R.; Gofas, S. (2010). Murex Linnaeus, 1758. In: Bouchet, P.; Gofas, S.; Rosenberg, G. (2010) World Marine Mollusca database. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=138196 on 2011-04-09 The common name murex is still used for many species in the family Muricidae which were originally given the Latin generic name Murex in the past, but have more recently been regrouped into different newer genera. The word murex was used by Aristotle in reference to these kinds of snails, thus making it one of the oldest classical seashell names still in use by the scientific community. Fossil records This genus is known in the fossil records from the Cretaceous to the Quaternary (age range: from 125.45 to 0.0 million years ago). Fossils of species within this genus have been found all over the world. There are about 25 known extinct species.Fossilworks Murex altispira Fossil shell of Murex spinicosta from Pliocene of Italy Distribution Murex is solely an Indo-Pacific genus, as demonstrated by Ponder & Vokes (1988). The species from the western Atlantic that were formerly considered to belong in the genus Murex are now placed in the genus Haustellum. Habitat Most Murex species live in the intertidal or shallow subtidal zone, among rocks and corals. Shell description This genus includes many showy members, their elongate shells highly sculptured with spines or fronds. The inner surfaces of their ornate shells are often brightly colored. Human use Costly and labor-intensive dyes Tyrian purple (or royal purple) and Tekhelet were historically made by the ancient Phoenicians using mucus from the hypobranchial gland of two species commonly referred to as \\"murex\\", Murex brandaris and Murex trunculus, which are the older names for Haustellum brandaris (Bolinus brandaris) and Hexaplex trunculus (Phyllonatus trunculus). This dye is a rare animal-produced organobromine compound, which the snails make using a specific bromoperoxidase enzyme that operates on dissolved bromide in sea water.Jannun R., Nuwayhid N. and Coe E. (1981) Biological bromination ‚Äì bromoperoxidase activity in the Murex sea-snail. FASEB. J. 40, 1774. This dye was used in royal robes, other kinds of special ceremonial or ritual garments, or garments indicating high rank. It is hypothesised that the dye was the same dye as that which featured prominently in the ancient Temple in Jerusalem, the clothing of the High Priest (or Kohen Gadol) officiating there; it is sometimes still used by Jews today in the ritual fringes (tzitzit) on four-cornered garments.Tekhelet - Biblical Blue Dye for Tzitzit A consensus has yet to be reached regarding the Biblical source of the \\"blue\\" dye.  Species  The genus Murex, as originally defined by Linnaeus, encompassed many taxa that are now placed elsewhere in the superfamily Muricoidea. During the 19th century, the definition of Murex was restricted by Lamarck and his contemporaries first to species in the family Muricidae, and then was limited even further to the subfamilies Muricinae and Ocenebrinae. Malacologists of the 19th century including Kiener, Reeve, K√ºster & Kobelt and Sowerby treated all muricoid forms as belonging to Murex. This is the main reason why Murex has so many synonyms.

This institution gave its name to the Beaux-Arts style Beaux-arts buildings at the University of California, Berkeley designed by John Galen Howard Beaux-Arts architecture (; ) was the academic architectural style taught at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, particularly from the 1830s to the end of the 19th century. It drew upon the principles of French neoclassicism, but also incorporated Gothic and Renaissance elements, and used modern materials, such as iron and glass. It was an important style in France until the end of the 19th century. It also had a strong influence on architecture in the United States, because of the many prominent American architects who studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, including Henry Hobson Richardson, John Galen Howard, Daniel Burnham, and Louis Sullivan. History The Beaux-Arts style evolved from the French classicism of the Style Louis XIV, and then French neoclassicism beginning with Style Louis XV and Style Louis XVI. French architectural styles before the French Revolution were governed by Acad√©mie royale d'architecture (1671‚Äì1793), then, following the French Revolution, by the Architecture section of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. The Academy held the competition for the Grand Prix de Rome in architecture, which offered prize winners a chance to study the classical architecture of antiquity in Rome. The formal neoclassicism of the old regime was challenged by four teachers at the Academy, Joseph-Louis Duc, F√©lix Duban, Henri Labrouste and L√©on Vaudoyer, who had studied at the French Academy in Rome at the end of the 1820s. They wanted to break away from the strict formality of the old style by introducing new models of architecture from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Their goal was to create an authentic French style based on French models. Their work was aided beginning in 1837 by the creation of the Commission of Historic Monuments, headed by the writer and historian Prosper M√©rim√©e, and by the great interest in the Middle Ages caused by the publication in 1831 of The Hunchback of Notre-Dame by Victor Hugo. Their declared intention was to \\"imprint upon our architecture a truly national character.\\" The style referred to as Beaux-Arts in English reached the apex of its development during the Second Empire (1852‚Äì1870) and the Third Republic that followed. The style of instruction that produced Beaux-Arts architecture continued without major interruption until 1968. The Beaux-Arts style heavily influenced the architecture of the United States in the period from 1880 to 1920. In contrast, many European architects of the period 1860‚Äì1914 outside France gravitated away from Beaux-Arts and towards their own national academic centers. Owing to the cultural politics of the late 19th century, British architects of Imperial classicism followed a somewhat more independent course, a development culminating in Sir Edwin Lutyens's New Delhi government buildings. Training The Beaux-Arts training emphasized the mainstream examples of Imperial Roman architecture between Augustus and the Severan emperors, Italian Renaissance, and French and Italian Baroque models especially, but the training could then be applied to a broader range of models: Quattrocento Florentine palace fronts or French late Gothic. American architects of the Beaux-Arts generation often returned to Greek models, which had a strong local history in the American Greek Revival of the early 19th century. For the first time, repertories of photographs supplemented meticulous scale drawings and on-site renderings of details. Beaux-Arts training made great use of agrafes, clasps that link one architectural detail to another; to interpenetration of forms, a Baroque habit; to \\"speaking architecture\\" (architecture parlante) in which supposed appropriateness of symbolism could be taken to literal-minded extremes. Beaux-Arts training emphasized the production of quick conceptual sketches, highly finished perspective presentation drawings, close attention to the program, and knowledgeable detailing. Site considerations included the social and urban context. All architects-in-training passed through the obligatory stages‚Äîstudying antique models, constructing , analyses reproducing Greek or Roman models, \\"pocket\\" studies and other conventional steps‚Äîin the long competition for the few desirable places at the Acad√©mie de France √† Rome (housed in the Villa Medici) with traditional requirements of sending at intervals the presentation drawings called envois de Rome. Characteristics File:DianaAndPomona.jpgBeaux-Arts building decoration presenting images of the Roman goddesses Pomona and Diana. Note the naturalism of the postures and the channeled rustication of the stonework. File:SFCityHallExteriorKeystone.jpgAlternating male and female mascarons decorate keystones on the San Francisco City Hall Beaux-Arts architecture depended on sculptural decoration along conservative modern lines, employing French and Italian Baroque and Rococo formulas combined with an impressionistic finish and realism. In the fa√ßade shown above, Diana grasps the cornice she sits on in a natural action typical of Beaux-Arts integration of sculpture with architecture. Slightly overscaled details, bold sculptural supporting consoles, rich deep cornices, swags and sculptural enrichments in the most bravura finish the client could afford gave employment to several generations of architectural modellers and carvers of Italian and Central European backgrounds. A sense of appropriate idiom at the craftsman level supported the design teams of the first truly modern architectural offices. Characteristics of Beaux-Arts architecture included: * Flat roof * Rusticated and raised first story * Hierarchy of spaces, from \\"noble spaces\\"‚Äîgrand entrances and staircases‚Äîto utilitarian ones * Arched windows * Arched and pedimented doors * Classical details: references to a synthesis of historicist styles and a tendency to eclecticism; fluently in a number of \\"manners\\" * Symmetry * Statuary, sculpture (bas-relief panels, figural sculptures, sculptural groups), murals, mosaics, and other artwork, all coordinated in theme to assert the identity of the building * Classical architectural details: balustrades, pilasters, festoons, cartouches, acroteria, with a prominent display of richly detailed clasps (agrafes), brackets and supporting consoles * Subtle polychromy Beaux-Arts architecture by country=France File:P1020033 Paris III CNAM Galeries exposition reductwk.JPGThe Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers by L√©on Vaudoyer (1838‚Äì67) File:Biblioth√®que St Genevi√®ve Paris.jpgThe Sainte-Genevi√®ve Library by Henri Labrouste (1844‚Äì50) File:Salle de lecture Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve n01.jpgInterior of the Sainte-Genevi√®ve Library by Henri Labrouste (1844‚Äì50) File:Paris 75005 Grande Galerie de l'Evolution 20070804.jpgMuseum of Natural History, Paris by Louis-Jules Andr√© (1877‚Äì1889) File:Main entrance of Grand Palais, Paris July 2014.jpgThe Grand Palais. Paris (1897‚Äì1900) The Beaux-Arts style in France in the 19th century was initiated by four young architects trained at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, architects; Joseph-Louis Duc, F√©lix Duban, Henri Labrouste and L√©on Vaudoyer, who had first studied Roman and Greek architecture at the Villa Medici in Rome, then in the 1820s began the systematic study of other historic architectural styles, including French architecture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They instituted teaching about a variety of architectural styles at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, and installed fragments of Renaissance and Medieval buildings in the courtyard of the school so students could draw and copy them. Each of them also designed new non-classical buildings in Paris inspired by a variety of different historic styles: Labrouste built the Sainte-Genevi√®ve Library (1844‚Äì50), Duc designed the new Palais de Justice and Court of Cassation on the √éle-de-la-Cit√© (1852‚Äì68), Vaudroyer designed the Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers (1838‚Äì67), and Duban designed the new buildings of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Together, these buildings, drawing upon Renaissance, Gothic and Romanesque and other non-classical styles, broke the monopoly of neoclassical architecture in Paris.

File:Pantlind Hotel, Grand Rapids, Michigan (87936).jpgThe Pantlind Hotel, now the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was designed by Warren and Wetmore. When completed in 1913, the Pantlind Hotel featured one of the largest gold leaf ceilings in the world. The first American architect to attend the √âcole des Beaux-Arts was Richard Morris Hunt, between 1846 and 1855, followed by Henry Hobson Richardson in 1860. They were followed by an entire generation. Henry Hobson Richardson absorbed Beaux-Arts lessons in massing and spatial planning, then applied them to Romanesque architectural models that were not characteristic of the Beaux-Arts repertory. His Beaux-Arts training taught him to transcend slavish copying and recreate in the essential fully digested and idiomatic manner of his models. Richardson evolved a highly personal style (Richardsonian Romanesque) freed of historicism that was influential in early Modernism.James Philip Noffsinger. The Influence of the √âcole des Beaux-arts on the Architects of the United States (Washington DC., Catholic University of America Press, 1955). The \\"White City\\" of the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago was a triumph of the movement and a major impetus for the short-lived City Beautiful movement in the United States. Beaux-Arts city planning, with its Baroque insistence on vistas punctuated by symmetry, eye- catching monuments, axial avenues, uniform cornice heights, a harmonious \\"ensemble,\\" and a somewhat theatrical nobility and accessible charm, embraced ideals that the ensuing Modernist movement decried or just dismissed.Chafee, Richard. The Architecture of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1977. The first American university to institute a Beaux-Arts curriculum is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1893, when the French architect Constant-D√©sir√© Despradelle was brought to MIT to teach. The Beaux-Arts curriculum was subsequently begun at Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. From 1916, the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in New York City schooled architects, painters, and sculptors to work as active collaborators. Numerous American university campuses were designed in the Beaux-Arts, notably: Columbia University, (commissioned in 1896), designed by McKim, Mead & White; the University of California, Berkeley (commissioned in 1898), designed by John Galen Howard; the United States Naval Academy (built 1901‚Äì1908), designed by Ernest Flagg; the campus of MIT (commissioned in 1913), designed by William W. Bosworth; Emory University and Carnegie Mellon University (commissioned in 1908 and 1904, respectively), both designed by Henry Hornbostel; and the University of Texas (commissioned in 1931), designed by Paul Philippe Cret. While the style of Beaux-Art buildings was adapted from historical models, the construction used the most modern available technology. The Grand Palais in Paris (1897‚Äì1900) had a modern iron frame inside; the classical columns were purely for decoration. The 1914‚Äì1916 construction of the Carolands Chateau south of San Francisco was built to withstand earthquakes, following the devastating 1906 San Francisco earthquake). The noted Spanish structural engineer Rafael Guastavino (1842‚Äì1908), famous for his vaultings, known as Guastavino tile work, designed vaults in dozens of Beaux-Arts buildings in the Boston, New York, and elsewhere. Beaux-Arts architecture also brought a civic face to the railroad. (Chicago's Union Station, Detroit's Michigan Central Station, Jacksonville's Union Terminal and Washington, DC's Union Station are famous American examples of this style.) Cincinnati has a number of notable Beaux-Arts style buildings, including the Hamilton County Memorial Building in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, and the former East End Carnegie library in the Columbia- Tusculum neighborhood. An ecclesiastical variant on the Beaux-Arts style is Minneapolis' Basilica of St. Mary, the first basilica in the United States, which was designed by Franco-American architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray (1861‚Äì1917) and opened in 1914 and a Freemason temple variant, The Plainfield Masonic Temple, in Plainfield, New Jersey, designed by John E. Minott in 1927. Two of the best American examples of the Beaux-Arts tradition stand within a few blocks of each other: Grand Central Terminal and the New York Public Library. Another prominent U.S. example of the style is the largest academic dormitory in the world, Bancroft Hall at the abovementioned United States Naval Academy.National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form [page 3]. National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior, September 1977, as recorded to the Maryland State Archives, 2 December 1992. Accessed 14 January 2016. The tallest railway station in the world at the time of completion, Michigan Central in Detroit, was also designed in the style. =Architects= In the late 1800s, during the years when Beaux-Arts architecture was at a peak in France, Americans were one of the largest groups of foreigners in Paris. Many of them were architects and students of architecture who brought this style back to America.Beaux-arts Architecture in New York: A Photographic Guide Front Cover Courier Dover Publications, 1988 (page vii‚Äìviii) The following individuals, students of the √âcole des Beaux- Arts, are identified as creating work characteristic of the Beaux-Arts style within the United States: * Otto Eugene Adams * William A.

He worked as an economist, bookseller, professor of the Basque language, a publisher, and a radio scriptwriter until 1980 when he dedicated himself completely to writing. His first text was published in 1972 in an anthology of Basque authors. His first short story, Ziutateaz (\\"About The City\\"), was published in 1976. His first collection of poetry, Etiopia (\\"Ethiopia\\"), appeared in 1978. He has written plays, song lyrics, novels and short stories. His book of short stories, Obabakoak (\\"Individuals and things of Obaba\\"), published in 1988 won him much fame and several prizes, such as Spain's National Literature Prize. So far, the book has been translated into more than 20 languages. Atxaga generally writes in the Basque language, Euskara, but translates his works into Spanish as well.

Her keel was laid down on 7 September 1937 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 27 July 1938 sponsored by Mrs. Bernice F. Defrees, wife of Rear Admiral Joseph R. Defrees, Sr, Chief of Staff to the Commander, Scouting Force, US Fleet. (Their son would later lose his life on this boat. See below) The boat was commissioned on 16 January 1939, Lieutenant Warren D. Wilkin in command. Service history=Inter-war period While on her initial shakedown cruise on 23 May 1939, Sculpin was diverted to search for , which had gone missing during a test dive. Sighting a red smoke bomb and a rescue buoy from Squalus, she established communications, first by underwater telephone and then by signals tapped in Morse code on the hull. Sculpin stood by while rescued the survivors, and rendered further assistance by familiarizing the divers with the configuration of her sister ship. Sculpin aided in the salvage of the sunken vessel by sounding out the approaches to Portsmouth, New Hampshire and preparing supplementary charts of the area where Squalus was refloated. Following the assistance given in the recovery of Squalus, Sculpin engaged in type training off the Atlantic coast until transferred to the Pacific Fleet. Departing Portsmouth on 28 January 1940, she arrived at San Diego, California on 6 March. She sailed west on 1 April, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 9 March, where she was based for the next 18 months. Departing Pearl Harbor on 23 October 1941 as part of Submarine Division 22,Blair, p. 83n. she arrived at Manila on 8 November. From Cavite, she engaged in local operations and type training until war broke out. First war patrol Departing Cavite on the night of 8‚Äì9 December 1941, Sculpin ‚Äì commanded by Lucius H. Chappell ‚Äì escorted and as far as San Bernardino Strait. She then took station off Lamon Bay in the Philippine Sea north of Luzon on 10 December. \\"The weather was foul, the visibility abysmal.\\"Blair, p. 137. When Frederick W. Warder's Seawolf was moved, Sculpin took up her station off Aparri, departing 21 December. Three days later, a Japanese task force came ashore at the unguarded Lamon Bay. Off Aparri, Sculpin detected a target, but was unable to gain firing position. After was twice \\"pooped\\" by heavy seas, Sculpin requested she be moved back to Lamon Bay, where she found weather so bad, she proved unable to attack Japanese shipping going in or out. Her first patrol terminated (after a duration of 45 days)Blair, p. 902. at Surabaya, Java, on 22 January. Second war patrol Her second patrol, from 30 January-28 February, was in the Molucca Sea, east of Sulawesi. On 4 February off Kendari, Java, she fired three torpedoes at a Japanese destroyer.Blair, p. 177. Two hits inflicted heavy damage. After the war, Japanese records revealed had beached herself, and was later salvaged. Three nights later, Sculpin detected a Japanese task force (bound for Makassar City, Celebes) made up of destroyers, cruisers, and an aircraft carrier (a startling sight, as it remained for the duration). She fired on a cruiser, missed and was detected and forced to dive. She escaped four hours later after a heavy depth charge attack by six destroyers. When she got loose, she radioed a contact report, which was not received. On the night of 17 February, she was detected while making a surface attack, firing two torpedoes each at a freighter and a destroyer, all of which missed,Though she did get credit for one ship of 5,000 tons at the time, this was not confirmed by JANAC. Blair, pp. 179, 904. and she was forced to dive. During the ensuing depth charge attack, she sustained damage to her starboard main controller and starboard shaft. On 28 February, after 28 days at sea,Blair, p. 904. she arrived at Fremantle for refit, falling under the command of Admiral Charles A. Lockwood.Blair, p. 303. Third war patrol Her third patrol, from 13 March-27 April out of Fremantle, was in the Banda Sea,Blair, p. 906. again off Kendari. Codebreakers got word a Japanese carrier force, Carrier Division Five, had arrived on 24 March. Two days later, this force departed Kendari; Sculpin failed to spot them,Blair, p. 192. but did fire three torpedoes at a freighter, all of which missed. The torpedoes were last seen running straight for the target, but apparently ran deeper than set. A similar incident occurred on 1 April in a night attack, and within a week, a third attack with three more torpedoes had also failed. Sculpin, like many of her sister submarines in the early days of the Pacific War, was plagued by malfunctions of the Mark 14 torpedo, which ran erratically or too deep, or of the Mark VI exploder, which failed to detonate them correctly. The frustrated Sculpin returned to Fremantle on 27 April, after forty-five unproductive days on patrol. Fourth war patrol Sculpins fourth war patrol, from 29 May ‚Äì 17 June, was in the South China Sea. On 8 June, she was unsuccessful in an attack on a cargo ship, again due to torpedo malfunction. A vigorous depth charge attack kept Sculpin down while the cargo ship escaped. On 13 June, near Balabac Strait, she torpedoed a cargo ship which returned fire with her deck gun and commenced to limp away. Turning on two accompanying tankers astern of the cargo ship, Sculpin made an attack but was forced to dive to prevent being rammed by one of the tankers. Surfacing at dusk, Sculpin pursued the cargo ship, but was again driven away by accurate gunfire from the maru. She shifted her attack to a tanker, leaving the ship listing and making heavy smoke. However, no sinking was confirmed. Off Cape Varella, Indochina, early on the morning of 19 June, she torpedoed a cargo ship, making a hit forward of the stack. A heavy secondary explosion was heard, and the damaged vessel was last seen headed for the shore to beach, smoke pouring from her forward hatch. Sculpin returned to Australia on 17 July. She moved to Brisbane, under Ralph Waldo Christie (part of Admiral Arthur S. Carpender's 7th Fleet, and ultimately General Douglas MacArthur's South West Pacific Area command), along with the rest of Submarine Squadron Two (SubRon 2), in August. Fifth war patrol The waters of the Bismarck Archipelago were the theater of her fifth patrol, from 8 September-26 October. After reconnaissance off Thilenius and Montagu harbors of New Ireland, Sculpin commenced her search for Japanese shipping. On 28 September, she scored two hits on a cargo ship, but was forced to dive as a Japanese destroyer raced to the scene. Sculpin was under depth charge attack for three hours, during which she sustained minor damage. On 7 October, she made her first confirmed kill, Naminoue Maru, off New Ireland. Escaping the Japanese escorts' countermeasures, she remained in the general area where, a week later, she intercepted a three-ship convoy in the shipping lane between Rabaul and Kavieng. Waiting until the escorting destroyer had made a patrol sweep to the opposite side of the convoy, Sculpin fired a spread of four torpedoes at Sumoyoshi Maru. While the blazing ship lay dead in the water and sinking, Sculpin slipped away. Four days later, she inflicted minor damage on , with a hit forward of the bridge, but was driven off by the cruiser's gunfire. For the 54-day duration of her patrol,Blair, p. 913. she was credited with three ships for 24,100 tons; postwar, only two for 6,652 tons were confirmed. Sixth war patrol Departing Brisbane on her sixth war patrol, from 18 November 1942 ‚Äì 8 January 1943, Sculpin worked her way past New Britain to the rich hunting grounds off Truk. After escaping a Japanese aerial attack on 11 December, she was put on the scent of a Japanese aircraft carrier by codebreakers. On the night of 17‚Äì18 December,Blair, p. 345. she closed to . One illuminated Sculpin with a searchlight as both commenced heavy fire with deck guns. The submarine went deep as the enemy depth charge attack and prolonged sonar search continued. The following night, she scored two hits on a tanker, with no sinking credited, and none confirmed postwar. For her 52-day patrol, Sculpin had nothing to show.Blair, p. 921. Refurbishment and seventh war patrol Sculpin arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 January 1943, and sailed east to San Francisco, California, spending three months in overhaul at Mare Island. Returning to Pearl Harbor on 9 May, she departed Hawaii for her seventh war patrol on 24 May and operated off the northwest coast of Honsh≈´. Around midnight on 9 June,Blair, p. 429. three days after arriving on station off Sofu Gan (also called Lot's Wife),Blair, p. 428. she detected a Japanese task force consisting of two aircraft carriers with a cruiser escort. Sculpin rang up flank speed to close, but was outdistanced. She made a desperate shot, four torpedoes from 7,000 yd (6,400 m); one exploded prematurely, giving her away, and she was unable to make a stern tube shot. Two heavy underwater explosions were heard as the submarine submerged. On 14 June, she damaged a cargo ship but was forced to dive and run silent to avoid the vigorous countermeasures of the marus escorts. On 19 June, she destroyed two sampans by gunfire, leaving them aflame, with decks awash. During the remainder of the patrol, she spotted other possible targets, but they all hugged the shore some running inside the 10 fathom (18 m) line. The patrol terminated at Midway Island on 4 July after 41 days; she was credited with no damage.Blair, p. 931. Eighth war patrol Sculpins eighth war patrol, from 25 July‚Äì17 September, was off the Chinese coast, in the East China Sea and Formosa Strait. On 9 August, she torpedoed and sank Sekko Maru off the coast of Formosa. She evaded ASW patrol craft in the Taiwan Strait on 16‚Äì17 August. On 21 August, she intercepted an armed cargo ship and fired a spread of three torpedoes which ran \\"hot, straight, and normal\\" but did not explode. Sculpin was immediately pounced upon by escorting destroyers and was forced to dive. The cargo ship escaped in the ensuing depth charge attack. A similar torpedo malfunction occurred on 1 September, when the splash of water resulting from the torpedo striking the target's hull could be seen, but no detonation occurred. The submarine escaped the immediate counterattack of the escorts, and after reconnaissance of Marcus Island, she returned to Midway Atoll after 54 days on patrol, earning credit for one ship of 4,500 tons (reduced to 3,183 tons postwar). Ninth war patrol and loss Following a brief overhaul period at Pearl Harbor, Sculpin ‚Äì commanded by Fred Connaway ‚Äì departed Hawaii on 5 November 1943. Ordered to patrol north of Truk, she was to intercept and attack Japanese forces leaving Truk to oppose the forthcoming invasion of Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands. Sculpin and two other submarines were to form a wolf pack to make coordinated attacks on the enemy, with either or .Blair, p. 524. Captain John P. Cromwell, who had been fully briefed on the Tarawa operation and was in the picture on ULTRA, was on board Sculpin to coordinate wolf pack operations. After refueling at Johnston Island on 7 November, Sculpin proceeded to her assigned station. On 29 November, Captain Cromwell was ordered to activate the wolf pack. When the submarine failed to acknowledge, the message was repeated 48 hours later. The submarine was presumed lost on 30 December and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 March 1944. The account of Sculpins final patrol was given by the surviving members of her crew, who were liberated from Japanese prisoner of war camps after V-J Day. On 16 November, she had arrived on station and had made radar contact with a large, high-speed convoy on the night of 18 November. Making a fast end run on the surface to attack on the morning of 19 November, she was in firing position but was forced to dive when the convoy and its escorts zigged toward her. When the Japanese task force changed course, Sculpin surfaced to make another run, but was discovered by , which the convoy commander had left behind for just this eventuality, only away. Diving fast, the submarine escaped the first salvo of depth charges. A second string of \\"ash cans\\" knocked out her depth gauge and caused other minor damage. She evaded the destroyer in a rain squall and around 1200 attempted to come to periscope depth. The damaged depth gauge stuck at , so the submarine broached and was again detected. She immediately submerged and the destroyer attacked with a pattern of 18 depth charges. There was considerable damage, including temporary loss of depth control. As a result, Sculpin ran beyond safe depth so that many leaks developed in the hull. So much water entered that the submarine was forced to run at high speed to maintain depth. This made tracking easy for the Japanese sonar. A second depth charge attack knocked out Sculpins sonar. The submarine's commanding officer, Commander Fred Connaway, decided to surface and give the crew of the doomed vessel a chance for survival. With her decks still awash, Sculpins gunners manned the deck guns but were no match for the destroyer's main battery. A shell hit the conning tower and killed the bridge watch, including Connaway, and flying fragments killed the gun crew, including gunnery officer Lieutenant Joseph Defrees, the ship's sponsor's son. The ship's senior surviving officer, Lieutenant George E. Brown, ordered Sculpin abandoned and scuttled. Before he opened the vents, he informed Captain Cromwell. Fearing he might reveal the plans for the Tarawa invasion under the influence of torture or drugs, Cromwell refused to leave the stricken submarine, giving his life to escape capture. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his act of heroism and devotion to country. Sculpins diving officer, Ensign W. M. Fiedler (who failed to notice the depth gauge had stuck), along with ten others, some doubtless already dead, joined him.Blair, p. 525. Forty-two of Sculpins crew were picked up by Yamagumo. One badly wounded sailor was thrown back in the sea because of his condition. The survivors were questioned for about ten days at the Japanese naval base at Truk, then were embarked on two aircraft carriers returning to Japan. carried 21 of the survivors in her hold. On 4 December, the carrier was torpedoed and sunk by and twenty of the American prisoners perished; one man, George Rocek, was saved when he was able to grab hold of a ladder on the side of a passing Japanese destroyer and hauled himself on board. (Ironically, Sailfish ‚Äì at the time named Squalus ‚Äì was the same submarine Sculpin had helped to locate and raise some four-and-a-half years before.) The other 21 survivors arrived at ≈åfuna Camp, Japan, on 5 December and, after further questioning, were sent to the Ashio copper mines for the duration of the war. Awards Sculpin was awarded eight battle stars for her service in World War II, in addition to the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation. She ended the war with a total of three confirmed ships sunk for 9,835 tons.Blair, pp. 913, 932. The Sculpin is the subject of an episode of the syndicated television anthology series, The Silent Service, which aired during the 1957‚Äì1958 season.

Cobb is also the co-founder of Move to Amend. Cobb later became the campaign manager for fellow Green Jill Stein for her presidential run in 2016. Early life, career and political activities Cobb was born on December 24, 1962, in San Leon, Texas. After working as a crewman on a Gulf Coast shrimp boat, a construction worker and a waiter, Cobb graduated from the University of Houston Law School in 1993. After several years in private practice as a Houston, Texas, attorney, he became engaged in politics. During the 1980s, he campaigned for the Democratic presidential candidacies of Jesse Jackson and Jerry Brown. Those experiences left him disenchanted with and disaffected from the Democratic Party. Consequently, he turned his activism to broad issues of democracy and corporations, joining with citizens' groups in lectures, seminars, and workshops throughout the U.S. He sought to promote his view that corporations became unelected governing institutions, which should be overthrown by means of a nonviolent democratic revolution. In 2000, Cobb answered the call of Green presidential candidate Ralph Nader to organize Nader's Texas campaign. He coordinated a successful ballot access drive in the state. Concurrently, Cobb became Green Party of the United States General Counsel. In 2002, Cobb ran for Texas Attorney General on the Green ticket and used his candidacy to \\"barnstorm\\" Texas localities with little Green representation. His election bid was unsuccessful, winning just 0.92 percent of the vote. The Green Party of Texas lost its ballot access, which remained out of reach until 2010. In 2003, a Green committee tagged him as a possible presidential candidate. 2004 presidential campaign Cobb campaigning for President in Wisconsin in September 2004 With the announcement in late December 2003 that Nader would not seek the Green Party nomination for president in 2004, Cobb became a front-runner for the nomination. On January 13, 2004, David Cobb won the first Green primary in the nation, that of the District of Columbia, beating local activist Sheila Bilyeu and several write- in candidates and gaining an early lead in the nomination scramble. Nader eventually announced an independent campaign for president and sought the endorsement of the Green Party and other minor parties; his supporters continued to push for a Nader victory in the various Green Party primary elections in states across the country. Shortly before,Green Party Congratulates and Welcomes Presidential Nominee David Cobb, Vice Presidential Nominee Pat LaMarche , Green National Convention, Forward 2004 the Green Party presidential nominating convention, held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in June 2004, Nader selected Green Party member Peter Camejo as his running mate. On June 26, on the second ballot, the convention selected Cobb as the Green presidential candidate ‚Äì a process rocked by controversy as Nader had won the vast majority of actual Green Party votes in nearly all state primary elections (Cobb received only 12.2 percent support). The party also nominated Pat LaMarche as its candidate for vice-president. Cobb stated his intention to run a campaign focused on building the Green Party and pursuing a \\"strategic states\\" or \\"smart states\\" strategy which would take into account the wishes of Greens in each state, and which otherwise would focus on states that traditionally are \\"safely\\" won by the Democratic candidate, or \\"safely\\" won by the Republican candidate, with a large margin of victory. Such so-called \\"safe states\\" are also referred to in campaign literature as \\"neglected states\\" because the Democratic and Republican candidates traditionally put most of their campaign energy into more competitive \\"swing states.\\" Cobb's campaign said that each state's campaign would aim to follow the wishes expressed by local Greens. While some of Cobb's supporters urged swing state residents to vote for Democrat John Kerry in order to stop the re-election of President George W. Bush, other Cobb supporters encouraged votes for Cobb and LaMarche everywhere. The candidates themselves used the phrase \\"vote your conscience,\\" campaigning both in swing states such as Wisconsin and safe states such as California. On October 8, 2004, Cobb was arrested in an act of civil disobedience, breaking a police line while protesting the Commission on Presidential Debates for excluding third-party candidates from the nationally televised debates in St. Louis, Missouri. Also arrested was Libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik. In the November 2004 presidential election, Cobb placed sixth in the popular vote total nationwide, earning over 119,859 votes (0.10 percent), but received no electoral votes. This represented a decline of over 90 percent support compared to the votes garnered by Nader. 2004 Ohio recount attempt After the 2004 election, Cobb and Libertarian nominee Michael Badnarik sought a recount of the Ohio vote and announced that they would challenge the 2004 presidential voting results in Ohio, even though neither challenger was claiming to have won the election, and even though Cobb had not even been on the ballot in Ohio. The challengers explained that it was an important matter of principle to make sure all the votes were counted accurately. They pointed to alleged voting irregularities.

After moving to Eureka, California in 2003, Cobb also won a seat on the County Council of the Green Party of Humboldt County in a hotly contested election on June 6, 2006, a position he maintains.

It was founded in 1907 by then-Cleveland mayor Tom L. Johnson. Prior to 1983, it was known as Municipal Light (or \\"Muny Light\\" for short). CPP does not have sufficient capacity to compete across the entire Greater Cleveland area. Rather, it is intended to create additional capacity and to create a benchmark price in order to prevent price gouging by local private utilities. In December 1978, Mayor Dennis Kucinich refused to sell the company when a number of banks, which were heavily invested in Muny Light's largest privately owned competitor, the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (better known as CEI or The Illuminating Company) refused to roll over the city's debt, as had previously been customary. This was seen as a bad move at the time; unable to pay its debts, the city became the first since the Great Depression to enter default, which cost Kucinich his job in next year's mayoral election. However, Kucinich's decision was later vindicated by both city officials and the U.S. Senate, which found that CEI and the banks had acted improperly. In December 2006, a new commissioner for CPP, Ivan Henderson, took over the reins from the incumbent James Majer. Under the new commissioner's guidance CPP is poised to take over the streetlight maintenance from CEI.

The changes result in a new political power structure that lasts for decades, replacing an older dominant coalition. Scholars frequently invoke the concept in American elections and occasionally those of other countries. American examples include the 1896 United States presidential election, when the issues of the American Civil War political system were replaced with those of the Populist and Progressive Era, and the 1932 United States presidential election, when the Populist and Progressive Eras were replaced by the New Deal issues of New Deal liberalism and modern conservatism. Realigning elections typically separate (what are known in the field of comparative politics as) party systems‚Äîwith 1828, for example, separating the First Party System and the Second Party System in the US. It is generally accepted that the United States has had five distinct party systems, each featuring two major parties attracting a consistent political coalition and following a consistent party ideology, separated by four realignments. Political realignments can be sudden (1‚Äì4 years) or can take place more gradually (5‚Äì20 years). Most often, however, particularly in V. O. Key Jr.'s (1955) original hypothesis, it is a single \\"critical election\\" that marks a realignment. By contrast, a gradual process is called a secular realignment. Political scientists and historians often disagree about which elections are realignments and what defines a realignment, and even whether realignments occur. The terms themselves are somewhat arbitrary, however, and usage among political scientists and historians does vary. In the US, Walter Dean Burnham argued for a 30‚Äì38 year \\"cycle\\" of realignments. Many of the elections often included in the Burnham 38-year cycle are considered \\"realigning\\" for different reasons. Other political scientists and quantitative elections analysts reject realignment theory altogether, arguing that there are no long- term patterns. Political scientist David R. Mayhew states, \\"Electoral politics is to an important degree just one thing after another ... Elections and their underlying causes are not usefully sortable into generation-long spans ... It is a Rip Van Winkle view of democracy that voters come awake only once in a generation ... It is too slippery, too binary, too apocalyptic, and it has come to be too much of a dead end.\\" Sean Trende, senior elections analyst at RealClearPolitics, who argues against realignment theory and the \\"emerging Democratic majority\\" thesis proposed by journalist John Judis and political scientist Ruy Teixeira in his 2012 book The Lost Majority states, \\"Almost none of the theories propounded by realignment theorists has endured the test of time... It turns out that finding a 'realigning' election is a lot like finding an image of Jesus in a grilled-cheese sandwich ‚Äì if you stare long enough and hard enough, you will eventually find what you are looking for.\\" In May 2015, statistician and FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver argued against a blue wall Electoral College advantage for the Democratic Party in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and in post-election analysis, Silver cited Trende in noting that \\"there are few if any permanent majorities\\" and both Silver and Trende argued that the \\"emerging Democratic majority\\" thesis led most news coverage and commentary preceding the election to overstate Hillary Clinton's chances of being elected. Realignment theory The central holding of realignment theory, first developed in the political scientist V. O. Key Jr.'s 1955 article, \\"A Theory of Critical Elections\\", is that American elections, parties and policymaking routinely shift in swift, dramatic sweeps. Key, E. E. Schattschneider, James L. Sundquist, Walter Dean Burnham are generally credited with developing and refining the theory of realignment.Schafer (1991); Rosenof (2003) Though they differed on some of the details, earlier realignments scholars generally concluded that systematic patterns are identifiable in American national elections such that cycles occur on a regular schedule: once every 36-years or so. This period of roughly 30 years fits with the notion that these cycles are closely linked to generational change. Some, such as Schafer and Reichley, argue that the patterns are longer, closer to 50 to 60 years in duration, noting the Democratic dominance from 1800 to 1860, and Republican rule from 1860 to 1932. Reichley argues that the only true realigning elections occurred in 1800, 1860, and 1932. Given the much longer length of time since the last generally accepted realignment in 1932, more recent scholars have theorized that realignments don't in fact operate on any consistent time scale, but rather occur whenever the necessary political, social, and economic changes occur. The alignment of 1860, with Republicans winning a series of close presidential elections, yielded abruptly in 1896 to an era of more decisive GOP control, in which most presidential elections were blowouts, and Democratic Congresses were infrequent and brief. Thirty-six years later, that system was displaced by a cycle of Democratic dominance, lasting throughout the Great Depression until Ronald Reagan's election as president in 1980 and the House election of 1994 when Republicans regained the majority for the first time in 40 years.Sundquist (1982); Rosenof (2003) Voter realignment A central component of realignment is the change in behavior of voting groups. Realignment means the switching of voter preference from one party to another, in contrast to dealignment (where a voter group abandons a party to become independent or nonvoting). In the US and Australia, as the ideologies of the parties define many of the aspects of voters' lives and the decisions that they make, a realignment by a voter tends to have a longer-lasting effect. In Britain and Canada, on the other hand, voters have a tendency to switch parties on a whim, perhaps only for one election, as there is far less loyalty towards a particular party. United States=Political realignment in United States history Here is presented a list of elections most often cited as \\"realigning\\", with disagreements noted: * 1800 presidential election ‚Äî Thomas Jefferson ** This election completed the turnover of power in the First Party System from the Federalist Party, led by Alexander Hamilton, to Jefferson and his Republican Party. The center of power shifted from New England to the South and Jeffersonian democracy became the dominant ideology. ** Republicans gained 19.7% of House seats in 1800, 9.4% in 1802 and 9.7% in 1804, for a total gain of 38.8% in 3 elections. ** As late as 1812, the Federalists came within one state of winning. A larger shift in electoral politics arguably came in the 1812‚Äì1816 period, as the Federalists became discredited after opposing the War of 1812. * 1828 presidential election ‚Äî Andrew Jackson ** This election redefined the party system in the United States, setting up the Second Party System, which was dominated by Jacksonian democracy. The Democratic-Republicans split into two parties, later renamed as the Democratic Party and the Whig Party. The Democrats were led by Andrew Jackson of Tennessee and Martin Van Buren of New York. By 1834 the Whigs emerged as the opposition to Andrew Jackson, led by Henry Clay of Kentucky.Silbey (1991) * 1860 presidential election ‚Äî Abraham Lincoln ** After the Whigs collapsed after 1852, party alignments were in turmoil, with several third parties, such as the Know Nothings and the Opposition Party. The system stabilized in 1858 and the presidential election marked the ascendence of the Republican Party. Abraham Lincoln beat out three other contenders ‚Äî but even if they had somehow united he still had the majority of the electoral vote. The Republican party was pledged to the long-term ending of slavery, which was proximate cause of secession. Republicans rallied around nationalism in 1861 and fought the American Civil War to end secession. During the war the Republicans, under Lincoln's leadership, switched to a goal of short-term ending of slavery. By 1864, the Republicans had a coalition built around followers of the \\"free labor\\" ideology, as well as soldiers and veterans of the Union Army. (Since then, the military establishment has favored the Republicans.) *** The Republican Party went from 18.3% of the House in 1854, to 38.0% in 1856, 48.7% in 1858, and 59.0% in 1860, for a total gain of 40.7% in 4 elections.Michael F. Holt, The Political Crisis of the 1850s (1978) * 1896 presidential election ‚Äî William McKinley ** The status of this election is hotly disputed; some political scientists, such as Jerome Clubb, do not consider it a realigning election. Other political scientists and historians, such as Kleppner and Burnham consider this the ultimate realignment and emphasize that the rules of the game had changed, the leaders were new, voting alignments had changed, and a whole new set of issues came to dominance as the old Civil War-era issues faded away. Funding from office holders was replaced by outside fund raising from business in 1896 ‚Äî a major shift in political history. Furthermore, McKinley's tactics in beating William Jennings Bryan (as developed by Mark Hanna) marked a sea change in the evolution of the modern campaign. McKinley raised a huge amount of money from business interests, outspending Bryan by 10 to 1. Bryan meanwhile invented the modern technique of campaigning heavily in closely contested states, the first candidate to do so.Robert J. Dinkin, Campaigning in America: A History of Election Practices (1989) Bryan's message of populism and class conflict marked a new direction for the Democrats. McKinley's victory in 1896 and repeat in 1900 was a triumph for pluralism, as all sectors and groups shared in the new prosperity brought about by his policy of rapid industrial growth.Lewis L. Gould, \\"New Perspectives on the Republican Party, 1877‚Äì1913,\\" American Historical Review, Vol. 77, No. 4 (Oct., 1972), pp. 1074‚Äì1082Burnham (1986) ** While Republicans lost House seats in 1896, this followed a massive two-election gain: from 25.9% in 1890 to 34.8% in 1892 and 71.1% in 1894, for a total 45.2% gain. Republicans lost 13.4% in 1896, but still held 57.7% of House seats. ** In terms of correlations among counties, the election of 1896 is a realignment flop, but this is only a problem if realignment is considered to occur in single elections. Rather, if realignment is thought of as a generational or long-term political movement, then change will occur over several elections, even if there is one \\"critical\\" election defining the new alignment. So, as pointed out above, the 1896 realignment really began around 1892, and the 130 seat GOP gain (after all, this is the all-time record) in 1894 meant there were almost no seats left to pick up in 1896. However, the presidential election in 1896 is usually considered the start of the new alignment since the national election allowed the nation to make a more conscious decision about the future of industrial policy by selecting McKinley over Bryan, making this the defining election in the realignment. The election of 1876 passes the numbers test much better compared to 1896 alone, and Mayhew (2004) argues it resulted in far more drastic changes in United States politics: Reconstruction came to a sudden halt, African-Americans in the South would soon be completely disenfranchised, and politicians began to focus on new issues (such as tariffs and civil service reform). * 1932 presidential election ‚Äî Franklin D. Roosevelt ** Of all the realigning elections, this one musters the most agreement from political scientists and historians; it is the archetypal realigning election.Schafer (1991) FDR's admirers such as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. have argued that New Deal policies, developed in response to the crash of 1929 and the miseries of the Great Depression under Herbert Hoover, represented an entirely new phenomenon in American politics. More critical historians such as Carl Degler and David Kennedy see a great deal of continuity with Hoover's energetic but unsuccessful economic policies. In many ways, Roosevelt's legacy still defines the Democratic Party; he forged an enduring New Deal Coalition of big city machines, the White South, intellectuals, labor unions, Catholics, Jews, and Westerners. In 1936, African-Americans were added to the coalition (African-Americans had previously been denied the vote or voted Republican). For instance, Pittsburgh, which was a Republican stronghold from the Civil War up to this point, suddenly became a Democratic stronghold, and has elected a Democratic mayor to office in every election since this time. ** The Democrats went from controlling 37.7% of House seats in 1928 to 49.6% in 1930 and 71.9% in 1932, for a total gain of 34.2% in two elections. ** In the Senate, the Democrats went from controlling 40.6% of seats in 1928 to 49% in 1930 and 61.5% in 1932, for a total gain of 20.9% in two elections. Other possible political realignments * 1874 elections ** The 1874 elections saw a resurgence of the Democratic Party. Discontent with the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant and the economic depression known at the time as the Panic of 1873, and the slow return of disillusioned Liberal Republicans from their 1872 third party ticket, all energized the Democrats. The Democrats had not controlled either chamber of Congress since before the War. The realignment meant the Democrats generally controlled the House of Representatives from 1875 to their massive defeat in 1894. Republicans eked out very narrow wins in most of the presidential elections in that period. The Civil Rights Act of 1875, enacted in the lame-duck session of Congress following the 1874 elections, was the last major Reconstruction law, and it was chiefly of symbolic value. The new strength of the Democrats marked the end of Reconstruction legislation. With the end of Reconstruction, the 11 former states of the Confederacy became a dominant-party system known as the Solid South. The tariff and especially monetary policy emerged as the great ideological debates after 1874. Some debate exists today as to what elections (if any) could be considered realigning elections after 1932.Mayhew (2004); Rosenof (2003); Shafer (1991) Although several candidates have been proposed, there is no widespread agreement: * 1964 and 1968 presidential elections ‚Äî Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon ** The 1968 election is often cited due to the innovative campaign strategy of Nixon.; Rosenof (2003); Shafer (1991) In running against Hubert Humphrey, he used what became known as the Southern strategy. He appealed to white voters in the South with a call for \\"states' rights\\", which they interpreted as meaning that the federal government would no longer demand the forced busing of school children as ordered by federal courts. Democrats protested that Nixon exploited racial fears in winning the support of white southerners and northern white ethnics.Perlstein, Nixonland (2008); Roosevelt's New Deal coalition had lasted over 30 years but after the urban riots and Vietnam crisis of the mid 1960s one by one the coalition partners peeled away until only a hollow core remained, setting the stage for a GOP revival. Nixon's downfall postponed the realignment which came about under Reagan, as even the term \\"liberalism\\" fell into disrepute. ** Including this as a realignment preserves the roughly 30-year cyclical pattern: 1896 to 1932, 1932 to 1964, and 1964 to 1994. ** For political scientists, 1964 was primarily an issue-based realignment. The classic study of the 1964 election, by Carmines and Stimson (1989), shows how the polarization of activists and elites on race-related issues sent clear signals to the general public about the historic change in each party's position on Civil Rights. Notably, while only 50% of African-Americans self-identified as Democrats in the 1960 National Election Study, 82% did in 1964, and the numbers are higher in the 21st century. The clearest indicator of the importance of this election was that Deep Southern states, such as Mississippi, voted Republican in 1964. In contrast, much of the traditional Republican strongholds of the Northeast and Upper Midwest voted Democratic. Vermont and Maine, which stood alone voting against FDR in 1936, voted for LBJ in 1964. ** Many analysts do not consider 1968 a realigning election because control of Congress did not change; the Democrats would control the Senate until 1980 (and again from 1986 to 1994) and the House until 1994. Also missing was a marked change in the partisan orientation of the electorate. Importantly, these two elections are consistent with the theory in that the old New Deal issues were replaced by Civil Rights issues as the major factor explaining why citizens identified with each party. Other scholarsKleppner (1981) contend that this is the beginning of a thirty- year dealignment, in which citizens generally moved towards political independence, which ended with the 1994 election. * 1980 presidential election ‚Äî Ronald Reagan ** In this election, Ronald Reagan won a sweeping victory over Democrat Jimmy Carter, who won only six states (plus the District of Columbia), which accounted for just 10% of the electoral vote. Republicans also took control of the Senate for the first time in over 25 years. (See Reagan's coattails.) ** The 1980 election can be seen as an ideological realignment, as it marked the beginning of the Reagan Era and marked a realignment towards conservatism and conservative policies. In addition, Reagan Democrats are a result of his presidency and campaigns. Many scholars viewed Reagan's policies as sufficiently new to consider this a realigning election.Rosenof (2003); Schafer (1991) ** On the other hand, critics like Mayhew (2004) note that control of the House did not change, nor even come close to changing, at this time. Republicans actually held fewer House seats in 1983 than they held in 1973. In addition, the Republicans lost the Senate again only six years later, leading some to conclude that the Senators simply rode in on Reagan's coattails, and did not represent a true shift in the ideological preferences of their constituents. Also absent was a shift in partisan alignment from public opinion polls.Abramowitz and Saunders (1998) Both liberals, such as Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, and conservatives, such as MSNBC political pundit, Nixon administration political advisor and Reagan administration Communications Director Pat Buchanan, would also argue that Nixon's victory in 1968 set the stage for Reagan's victory, and the fact that Reagan did so well in Southern states, traditionally a Democratic stronghold, as well as the fact that some of Reagan's rhetoric involving law and order and states' rights seemed to mirror Nixon's Southern Strategy seem to bear this fact out.Krugman, Paul. The Conscience of a Liberal. New York City; W. W. Norton, 2007. Print. * 1992 presidential election ‚Äî Bill Clinton ** Clinton carried several states that had previously been Republican or swing states in both the Northeast and on the West Coast. Most notably, the largest state California switched from being a reliably Republican state to being consistently Democratic: it has been carried by Democratic candidates ever since. Other states that switched and have remained with the Democrats since include Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, and Vermont. In contrast, despite the fact Clinton came from the South, he only carried four of the former Confederate states: Arkansas (his home state), Louisiana, Tennessee (his vice president's home state) and Georgia, confirming it as a Republican base of support. ** Since 1992, the Democratic candidate has won the national popular vote in every presidential election except 2004, suggesting some manner of national realignment away from the Republican domination of the 1970s and 1980s. This national tendency toward Democratic presidential candidates did not necessarily translate to Democratic victories in congressional elections. However Republicans remained competitive nationally, making historic gains in the 1994 and 2010 midterms, although the composition of the electorate in presidential versus midterm elections vary significantly. * 1994 House of Representatives and Senate electionsJenkins et al. (2006) ** This election is now generally seen as a realigning election by political scientists. Republicans won majorities in both the House and the Senate, taking control of both chambers for the first time since 1954. In addition, control of the House continued until 2007. Newt Gingrich, who promoted a \\"Contract with America\\", successfully nationalized the campaign by coordinating races around the country. The overwhelming nature of the Republicans' victory points to a realignment; the party gained 54 seats (in a chamber of only 435), while neither party would gain more than a handful of seats in any election until 2006. ** The GOP gained seats in 43 of 46 state houses. These gains continued into the next decade, so that by 2002 the GOP held the majority of state legislative seats for the first time in fifty years. ** Notably, the period of party decline and mass dealignment appears to have ended in the 1990s. Strength of partisanship, as measured by the National Election Study, increased in the 1990s, as does the percentage of the mass public who perceive important differences between each party. ** This election also indicates the rise of religious issues as one of the most important cleavage in American politics. While Reagan's election hinted at the importance of the religious right, it was the formation of the Christian Coalition (the successor to the Moral Majority) in the early 1990s that gave Republicans organizational and financial muscle, particularly at the state level.Ruth Murray Brown, For a Christian America: A History of the Religious Right (2002) By 2004 the media portrayed the political nation as divided into \\"red\\" (Republican) and \\"blue\\" (Democratic) states, with reputed differences in cultural attitudes and politics between the two blocs. ** The Republicans made historic inroads in the Solid South where they picked up total of 19 House seats. Going into the election, House Democrats outnumbered House Republicans. Afterwards, the Republicans outnumbered Democrats for the first time since Reconstruction. * 2008 presidential election ‚Äî Barack Obama ** In the 2008 elections, the Democrats expanded their majorities in the Congress, and won the presidency decisively. This was due to the momentum carried over from the Democrats' 2006 successes, as well as the continued unpopularity of President George W. Bush, whose administration was now faced with a financial crisis and economic recession. Some people believe that 2008 is possibly a realigning election with a long-lasting impact, just as the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt was in 1932 and the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 were. President Obama was reelected in the 2012 election as well, becoming only the third Democrat to win an absolute majority of the popular vote more than once while losing only two entire states that he had won in 2008. ** On the other hand, the Republican Party experienced major gains two years later in 2010, retaking the house with a gain of 63 seats, the largest Republican gain in 80 years. Additionally, the Republican Party gained 6 seats in the Senate, slimming the Democratic majority. Despite Obama's reelection in 2012, the Republicans had another strong performance in the 2014 midterms; they not only increased their majority in the House and recaptured the Senate, but also made gains in the gubernatorial races and other statewide and local races, resulting in 31 Republican governorships and 68 state legislative houses under Republican control, thus increasing their influence to the largest Republican majority in the entire country in nearly a century. * 2016 presidential election ‚Äî Donald Trump ** In this election, Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, all Midwestern and/or Rust Belt states that some had previously considered safely Democratic, though those states were close in several prior elections. Trump also came close to winning New Hampshire, Minnesota and Maine and outperformed previous Republican candidates in Connecticut and Rhode Island, winning more counties and towns in the Northeast than any Republican since 1988. ** The Republican Party maintained their lead in both the House and Senate. *** The Republicans set a modern record of holding 33 governorships and fully controlling 32 state legislatures. ** However, like with the 2008 Obama election, two years later in the 2018 United States elections, the Republican Party lost control of the House in a loss of 40 seats, but gained two seats in the Senate, so the full effect of the 2016 election and Trump Presidency as a critical election remains to be seen. Canada The history of the critical realigning elections in Canada, both nationally and in the provinces, is covered by Argyle (2011).Ray Argyle, Turning Points: The Campaigns That Changed Canada - 2011 and Before (2011) excerpt and text search 441pp Behiels (2010) suggests that experts in Canadian politicsBehiels cites Tom Flanaganm Harpers Team: Behind the Scenes in the Conservative Rise to Power (2nd ed. McGill-Queens U.P. 2009); Chantal H√©bert, French Kiss: Stephen Harpers Blind Date with Quebec (Knopf Canada, 2007); William Johnson, Stephen Harper and the Future of Canada (2nd ed.

In light of the 2004, 2006, and 2008 minority government elections and the success of Stephen Harper, many journalists, political advisors, and politicians argue that a new political paradigm is emerging, and it is based on Harper's drive for a right-wing political party capable of reconfiguring the role of the state ‚Äì federal and provincial ‚Äì in twenty-first century.Michael D. Behiels, \\"Stephen Harper's Rise to Power: Will His 'New' Conservative Party Become Canada's 'Natural Governing Party' of the Twenty-First Century?,\\" American Review of Canadian Studies Vol. 40, No. 1, March 2010, 118‚Äì145 Bloomfield and Nossal (2007) suggest that the new political alignment has reshaped Canadian foreign policy, especially in improving relations with the US, taking a harder line on the Middle East conflicts, and backing away from the Kyoto Protocol on global warming.Alan Bloomfield and Kim Richard Nossal, \\"Towards an Explicative Understanding of Strategic Culture: The Cases of Australia and Canada\\", Contemporary Security Policy, (2007) 28:2, 286 - 307 online FederalParty systems model According to recent scholarship there have been four party systems in Canada at the federal level since Confederation, each with its own distinctive pattern of social support, patronage relationships, leadership styles, and electoral strategies.Alain-G. Gagnon, and A. Brain Tanguay, Canadian Parties in Transition (3rd ed. 2007) Steve Patten identifies four party systems in Canada's political historySteve Patten, \\"The Evolution of the Canadian Party System\\". in Gagnon, and Tanguay, eds. Canadian Parties in Transition pp. 57‚Äì58 * The first party system emerged from pre- Confederation colonial politics, had its \\"heyday\\" from 1896 to 1911 and lasted until the Conscription Crisis of 1917, and was characterized by local patronage administered by the two largest parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives. * The second system emerged following the First World War, and had its heyday from 1935 to 1957, was characterized by regionalism and saw the emergence of several protest parties, such as the Progressives, the Social Credit Party, and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. * The third system emerged in 1963 and had its heyday from 1968 to 1983 and began to unravel thereafter. The two largest parties were challenged by a strong third party, the New Democratic Party. Campaigns during this era became more national in scope due to electronic media, and involved a greater focus on leadership. The dominant policy of the era was Keynesian economics. * The fourth party system has involved the rise of the Reform Party, the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois, and the merger of the Canadian Alliance with the Progressive Conservatives. It saw most parties move to one-member-one-vote leadership contests, and a major reform to campaign finance laws in 2004. The fourth party system has been characterized by market-oriented policies that abandoned Keynesian policies, but maintained the welfare state. Clarkson (2005) shows how the Liberal Party has dominated all the party systems, using different approaches. It began with a \\"clientelistic approach\\" under Laurier, which evolved into a \\"brokerage\\" system of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s under Mackenzie King. The 1950s saw the emergence of a \\"pan-Canadian system\\", which lasted until the 1990s. The 1993 election ‚Äî categorized by Clarkson as an electoral \\"earthquake\\" which \\"fragmented\\" the party system, saw the emergence of regional politics within a four party-system, whereby various groups championed regional issues and concerns. Clarkson concludes that the inherent bias built into the first-past- the-post system, has chiefly benefited the Liberals.Stephen Clarkson, The Big Red Machine: How the Liberal Party Dominates Canadian Politics (2005) =1896= 1896 saw a Liberal victory; Sir Wilfrid Laurier Prime Minister. From the 1867 election until 1896, the Conservative Party of Sir John A. Macdonald had governed Canada, excepting a single term from 1873 to 1878. The Liberals had struggled to retake office, under Laurier and his predecessor, Edward Blake. 1896 was the first election held after the death of Macdonald in 1891, and the Conservatives had been in complete disarray in the ensuing years, with no less than four different leaders. The Liberals would remain in office until 1911. Beyond that, political scientists often consider this election that made the Liberal Party the dominant force in Canadian politics, holding office for more than two thirds of the time between 1896 and 2006.Ray Argyle, Turning Points: The Campaigns That Changed Canada - 2011 and Before (2011) excerpt and text search ch 4 =1984= 1984 saw the victory of the Progressive Conservatives under Brian Mulroney. The election of 1984 not only saw Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives win the largest number of seats in Canadian History (211 of 282), and the second largest majority (behind John Diefenbaker's 208 of 265 in 1958), it ended over twenty years of Liberal rule, not counting the brief 1979‚Äì1980 tenure of Joe Clark. The Liberal Party under prime minister John Turner suffered its worst defeat ever at the time, winning a mere 40 seats. At the time, it was the worst defeat of a sitting government in Canadian history. Turner had just succeeded Pierre Trudeau as prime minister when he decided to call the election, and the Liberals were losing popularity due to the downfall of the economy and Trudeau's last minute patronage appointments. The PCs' victory was aided in large part by a massive breakthrough in Quebec, winning 58 seats as compared to the one Quebec seat they won in 1980; Mulroney successfully campaigned in Quebec on a message that Trudeau's Liberals had \\"sold out\\" the province during the process of patriating the Canadian constitution in 1982, due to the fact that Quebec never formally signed on to the new constitution. The Liberals were cut down to only 17 seats, all but four of them in Montreal. Although Quebec had been a Liberal stronghold since 1896 (with the exception of 1958), from 1984 to the 2015 Canadian federal election the Liberals failed to win the most seats in the province (they came close in 2000 and took the majority by winning several by-elections), making this province the most long-lasting realignment in this election. Although Mulroney is often grouped with contemporary conservative leaders Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, and the 1984 election is seen as Canada's version of the 1979 United Kingdom and 1980 United States elections, Mulroney proved in practice to be a relatively centrist leader. =1993= 1993 saw not only the sweeping success of the Liberals under Jean Chr√©tien, but also the fracturing the Progressive Conservatives' support base to regional parties in Quebec and the western provinces; resulting in a five party political system with the Liberals as the dominant party. Throughout Canadian history two parties had taken turns in government and opposition: the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives (sometimes known as Liberal- Conservatives, Conservatives, Union and National Government). The Conservative majority election victories in 1984 and 1988 were based on a \\"Grand Coalition\\" between socially conservative populists from the West, Quebec nationalists, and fiscal conservatives from Ontario and the Maritimes, making it difficult for the Mulroney government to balance these diverse interests. During his second term, Mulroney's policies were unpopular, while the failure of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords frustrated Quebec and stirred up Western alienation. New regional parties which formed in protest to Mulroney's government, the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois in Quebec and the Reform Party in the west won many seats formerly held by the PCs despite a lack of national support. The New Democratic Party, the longtime third party in parliament, fell from 43 seats to nine. The unpopularity of the provincial NDP governments in Ontario and BC reflected badly on the federal NDP, also their endorsement of the Charlottetown Accord and Quebec nationalism cost them support among organized labour and rural voters in the West, which switched their support to Reform. Meanwhile, the Progressive Conservatives were nearly wiped out, falling from 151 seats to only two‚Äîthe worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level. The Liberals under Chr√©tien would win a further two consecutive majorities in 1997 and 2000, while never being seriously challenged as the largest party. The Progressive Conservatives never recovered, winning 20 (of 301) seats in 1997 and 12 in 2000 before merging with the Reform Party's successor, the Canadian Alliance, to form the new Conservative Party of Canada in late 2003. Due to competition with the Liberals for left-leaning voters, the New Democrats had mixed successes in the next several elections, winning 21 in 1997 but dropping back to 13 in 2000, unable to approach their high- water mark showing until 2006. =2004= While Paul Martin's Liberals retains enough seats to continue as the government, it saw the re-emergence of the Conservatives and the resurgence of Bloc Qu√©b√©cois; resulting in a four party system with the ruling party as a minority government. This was the first of three elections where no party managed a majority of seats. Martin succeeded a retiring Jean Chr√©tien in 2003 and initially polls predicted that the Liberals could expand their control of Parliament in the next election, as Martin sought inroads in Quebec and Western Canada, while the newly created Conservative Party was besought by controversy over its merger. However, the revelation of the sponsorship scandal, along with party infighting between Chr√©tien and Martin weakened the Liberals, while the reunited Conservatives became a viable governing alternative, and the rejuvenated Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. At mid-campaign, polls predicted a Conservative lead, but the Liberals regained enough support to win a plurality of seats to remain the governing party. Several trends would also begin in 2004 which signaled the Liberal party's decline; notably a high turnover of permanent party leaders (in contrast to their predecessors who usually served over two or more elections), and its inability to raise campaign funds competitively once Chr√©tien banned corporate donations, and it would gradually lose support to the Conservatives, and later to the NDP. The 2004 election paved the way for the election of 2006, which brought about the first electoral victory of a Canadian conservative party since 1988 and the first conservative government in Canada since November 1993. This ended 13 years of Liberal government, whose minority government in 2004‚Äì2006 was propped up by the New Democratic Party until they withdrew their support after fallout from the sponsorship scandal. As early as 1989, conservative Stephen Harper had theorized that a realignment would occur, pitting middle-class taxpayers against middle-class tax recipients.William Johnson, Stephen Harper and the Future of Canada (2006) pp 117‚Äì19 =2011= The election resulted in a Conservative majority victory under the leadership of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, after forming two consecutive minority governments.Ray Argyle, Turning Points: The Campaigns That Changed Canada - 2011 and Before (2011) excerpt and text search ch 1Howard Cody and Jamie Gillies. \\"The Canadian Party System and the Leadership of Stephen Harper.\\" The New England Journal of Political Science 8.1 (2015): 2+. The Liberals dropped to third party status in Parliament for the first time, having previously always been either the governing party or the official opposition, and also no longer had a significant number of seats in Quebec (their bastion of support from 1892 to 1984) or Ontario (a stronghold since 1993, especially the Greater Toronto Area). Some suggested that Rob Ford's mayoral victory in November 2010 had paved the way for the federal Conservatives' successes in Toronto, with right-of-centre politicians garnering significant support from immigrants that traditionally supported the Liberals. The New Democratic Party, led by Jack Layton, won 103 seats to become the official opposition for the first time in party history, as a late-campaign surge of support in Quebec took them from one to 59 seats at the expense of the other parties, particularly the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois which saw their 47 seats in that province reduced to a rump of four seats. The Bloc had previously won the majority of Quebec's seats from 1993 to 2008. The party leaders of the Liberals and the Bloc, Michael Ignatieff and Gilles Duceppe, respectively, were personally defeated in their own constituencies. This marked a return to the three party system in parliament which was last seen in the 1988 election. Commentators after the major shakeup in 2011 stressed the theme of a major realignment.Royce Koop, and Amanda Bittner, \\"Parties and Elections after 2011: The Fifth Canadian Party System?.\\" in Amanda Bittner and Royce Koop, eds, Parties, Elections, and the Future of Canadian Politics (2013): 308-31. The Economist said, \\"the election represents the biggest realignment of Canadian politics since 1993.\\"Economist May 3, 2011 Lawrence Martin, commentator for the Globe and Mail said, \\"Harper has completed a remarkable reconstruction of a Canadian political landscape that endured for more than a century. The realignment sees both old parties of the moderate middle, the Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals, either eliminated or marginalized.\\"Lawrence Martin, \\"Harper's triumph: a realignment of historic proportions, Globe and Mail May 4, 2011 Maclean's said, the election marked \\"an unprecedented realignment of Canadian politics\\" as \\"the Conservatives are now in a position to replace the Liberals as the natural governing party in Canada.\\" Andrew Coyne proclaimed \\"The West is in and Ontario has joined it\\", noting that the Conservatives accomplished the rare feat of putting together a majority by winning in both Ontario and the western provinces (difficult due to traditionally conflicting interests), while having little representation in Quebec.Andrew Coyne, \\"The West is in and Ontario has joined it: How the election led to an unprecedented realignment of Canadian politics.\\" Maclean's May 6 2011 =2015= After the longest campaign in modern Canadian history, the voters ousted Harper's Conservative government and elected a new national government on October 19, 2015. The new Prime Minister Justin Trudeau led his Liberal Party to a majority government. The Conservative Party fell to second place with 99 seats, marking a return to previous system with the New Democratic Party returning into a third party status after achieving Official Opposition in 2011. The Liberal Party also won a majority of seats in Quebec for the first time since 1980.Jon H. Pammett and Christopher Dornan, eds., The Canadian Federal Election of 2015 (Dundurn, 2016). Alberta * 1971 Alberta general election ‚Äì End of the 36-year unbroken rule of the Social Credit Party, in favour of the Progressive Conservatives. Peter Lougheed's Conservatives defeated the Socreds led by Premier Harry E. Strom. Although the Socreds lost only a small share of its popular vote from 1967, their support in the province's two largest cities, Edmonton and Calgary, almost disappeared. They lost all of their seats in Edmonton, and all but five seats in Calgary. ** There were ominous signs of Socreds' decline in the 1967 election, in which they failed to win 50% of the popular vote since 1955. Longtime Premier Ernest C. Manning retired a few months later. His successor Strom had been unable to revive a party that had grown tired and complacent, while the collapse of the other opposition parties made the PCs the only credible challenger to the Socreds. The Socreds sank into near-paralysis in opposition, being ill-prepared for that role after being the governing party for virtually all of its history prior to 1971. Their support collapsed in the 1975 election, in which they barely held onto official status. Although the Socreds stayed in the legislature until 1982, they were never a force Albertan politics again. ** The Progressive Conservatives won every election since 1968, prior to 2015, despite losing some luster during Don Getty's tenure of 1985‚Äì1992, they have regained strength under Ralph Klein. * 2015 Alberta general election - The 44-year unbroken rule of the Progressive Conservatives (which begun in 1971) was ended by the Alberta New Democratic Party, who won a majority government and reduced the PCs to third place in the legislature. British Columbia * 1991 British Columbia general election ‚Äì End of Social Credit as an effective political force in British Columbia politics. The Socreds under Premier Rita Johnston was reduced to third party status, while the New Democratic Party of Mike Harcourt formed the government. Liberal Party leader Gordon Wilson surprised observers by leading his party to winning one-third of the votes cast. This was enough to not only return them to the legislature, but make them the official opposition. * The Socreds had been beset by scandals during Bill Vander Zalm's last term as premier. Party control shifted from urban fiscal conservatives to social conservatives, causing the coalition to unravel and pushing many moderates to eventually switch to the Liberals. After Premier Vander Zalm resigned, Socred members voted the lesser-known Johnston, a close ally of Vander Zalm, over Grace McCarthy. Many viewed this as a mistake, as Johnston was close to the Vander Zalm legacy; even NDP leader Harcourt admitted later that he preferred Johnston over McCarthy. Wilson's party gained gradually but surged after his strong performance in the televised leaders' debates' Wilson was initially not invited and took legal action to overturn his exclusion. However, once he became opposition leader, Wilson proved unable to consolidate the party's leadership; he was eventually deposed and later became a New Democrat. * 2001 British Columbia general election - The centre- right coalesced around the BC Liberal Party, which won 77 of 79 seats and 57.6% of the popular vote. This essentially rebuilt much of the Socred coalition around the BC Liberal Party. At the same time, the NDP faced significant unpopularity after several scandals (such as the Fast Ferry Scandal), and failed to break the Liberal majority until 2017. Quebec A considerable number of Quebec general elections have been known characterized by high seat turnovers, with certain ones being considered realigning elections, notably: * The 1936 election which ended 39 years of Liberal rule, 16 of them recently under Louis-Alexandre Taschereau and saw the rise of Maurice Duplessis's Union Nationale. * The 1960 election, after the deaths of Duplessis and his successor Paul Sauv√©, which ended 15 continuous years of Union Nationale rule and precipitated its gradual decline. It also ushered in the Quiet Revolution under Jean Lesage. * The 1976 election, which saw Ren√© L√©vesque's Parti Qu√©b√©cois not only make a breakthrough in the National Assembly, it also drove Robert Bourassa's Liberals from office. It also made sovereignty the dominant political issue. * The 1985 election marked the successful political comeback of Bourassa and his Liberals, while also putting sovereignty as an issue to rest until a decade later. *The 2018 election witnessed the end of the sovereignty-federalist split in Quebec in favour of a Conservative and Nationalist Alternative The Quebec Liberal Party (unaffiliated with the federal Liberals since 1955) survived since Confederation but they have faced different opposition parties, several of which had formed the government, often alternating with the Liberals. * 2007 Quebec general election ‚Äì Ascent of the Action d√©mocratique du Qu√©bec (ADQ) to Official Opposition status ** While the federalist Liberals maintained a plurality in the National Assembly of Quebec and Jean Charest remained Premier, the conservative, Quebec nationalist ADQ successfully replaced the social democratic and sovereigntist Parti Qu√©b√©cois as the Official Opposition; prior to this election, the ADQ never had more than five Members of the National Assembly. * 2008 Quebec general election ‚Äì Return of the Action d√©mocratique du Qu√©bec (ADQ) to third party status ** The ADQ lost the great majority of the seats they had gained in the previous year. Soon after the election, leader Mario Dumont resigned and the party fell into a period of disarray. Since the 1990s, provincial elections in Quebec show increasing voter realignment and volatility in party support.James P. Allan, and Richard Vengroff. \\"Party System Change in Qu√©bec: Evidence from Recent Elections.\\" Southern Journal of Canadian Studies 6.1 (2015): 2-20. Outside of North America=Asia * 1977 Indian general election ** The left-wing Indian National Congress, which had led the country to independence from the United Kingdom in 1947 and had won every general election since the first post- independence election in 1952, lost power to the right-wing Janata Party led by Morarji Desai, after the immensely unpopular imposition of The Emergency by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi since 1975. Both Indira Gandhi and her son Sanjay lost their seats. * 1977 Israeli legislative election ** Likud defeated the Alignment, led by the Israel Labor Party, allowing Likud to lead a government for the first time ever. For the first 29 years of Israel's independence, politics had been dominated by the left-wing parties Labor and its predecessor, Mapai. Prior to this election a hypothetical bloc of right-wing and religious parties would rarely ever approach the threshold of a majority government; however since 1977, a combination of these two blocs have made up the majority of Israel's electorate since then with exceptions of a few elections but no longer running far behind in comparison to pre-1977. Due to corruption in the Labor Party, many former Labor voters defected to the new Democratic Movement for Change, which won 15 seats and finished in third place, behind the Likud with 46 seats and Alignment (Labor plus Mapam) with 32 seats. The DMC collapsed within three years, allowing Labor to rebound at the next election. Labor and Likud dominated Israeli politics until 2003 when Labor went into sudden decline due to a backlash against the failed Oslo Accords and the outbreak of the Second Intifada. * 2000 Taiwanese presidential election ‚Äî Chen Shui-bian ** Though more popular and consistently ranked higher in the polls, James Soong failed to gain the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT) nomination over incumbent Vice President Lien Chan. As a result, he announced his candidacy as an independent candidate, and was consequently expelled from the party. The split in the KMT vote resulted in a victory for Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party, even though he won only 39% of the popular vote. After the election, Soong founded the People First Party, which attracted members from the KMT and the pro-unification New Party, which was by that time beginning to fade. Angry from the defeat, the KMT expelled chairman Lee Teng-hui, who was president until 2000 and was widely suspected of causing the KMT split so that Chen would win. Lee then founded the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union. The impact of these events changed the political landscape of Taiwan. Not only did the KMT lose the presidency for the first time in half a century, but its policies swung away from Lee's influence and it began intra-party reform. The two newly founded parties became far more viable than other minor parties in the past, and the multi-party nature of Taiwan's politics was confirmed by the legislative elections of 2001. The KMT would not return to power until 2008 under the leadership of Ma Ying-jeou. * 2002 Turkish general election ‚Äî Justice and Development Party victory ** This election was notable in that every party in the previous Grand National Assembly of Turkey was ejected from Parliament, as none of them crossed the 10% threshold. This not only included the governing coalition of the Democratic Left Party, Motherland Party and Nationalist Movement Party, but the largest opposition party, the True Path Party. The AKP, which formed the government following this election, has dominated Turkish politics ever since. * 2006 Palestinian legislative election (Palestinian National Authority) ‚Äî Hamas victory; Ismail Haniyeh Prime Minister ** In January 2006 the militant Hamas organisation, classified as a terrorist group by the United States government and other groups, won a landslide victory over the ruling Fatah party which had been in power under the leadership of former PLO chairman Yasser Arafat. The Bush Administration, the Quartet, and Israel all threatened to cut off foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority if Hamas refused to abandon terrorist tactics and recognise the right of the State of Israel to exist. This concession, though discussed in Hamas circles, did not come about soon enough to prevent a serious breakdown in services under Hamas government, and Western (especially American) support of Fatah paramilitaries eventually led to the breakout of the Fatah‚ÄìHamas conflict (termed a \\"Palestinian Civil War\\" by some) in December 2006. The Hamas government was suspended by PA President Mahmoud Abbas, a member of Fatah, after some weeks of fighting, and installed a caretaker government under the leadership of Salam Fayyad. * 2020 South Korean legislative election ‚Äî Democratic victory ** The ruling liberal Democratic Party of President Moon Jae-in and its allies won a landslide victory with the largest number of seats for any political party in South Korean history with 180 of 300 seats in the National Assembly. This was also the worst showing for conservative parties in history and marked a fourth consecutive election defeat with the 2016 Assembly elections, the 2017 presidential election and 2018 local government elections. Previously, liberal administrations governed but in alliances with moderate conservatives or with a divided conservative opposition. Factors leading to this result included: the negative association of conservatives with the 2008-17 rule of Presidents Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak who were jailed for corruption and continued division over Park's impeachment between party factions. Europe * 1918 Irish general election ‚Äî Sinn F√©in victory ** For the previous four decades, Irish politics had been dominated by the moderate nationalist Irish Parliamentary Party, which sought Home Rule within the United Kingdom. The 1918 general election was a landslide victory for the republican Sinn F√©in party, which won nearly 70% of the seats. The new Sinn F√©in MPs refused to take their seats in the House of Commons, and instead set up their own republican assembly called D√°il √âireann. This assembly issued a unilateral Declaration of Independence, which led to the start of the War of Independence and eventually led to Irish independence from the United Kingdom in 1922. The Irish Parliamentary Party never recovered from this defeat. The two largest parties in Ireland, Fianna F√°il and Fine Gael, originated from splits in the Sinn F√©in party which won the election of 1918. * 1922 United Kingdom general election - Conservative victory; Bonar Law Prime Minister ** This election marked the Conservatives' first general election victory since 1900. More importantly, the Labour Party passed the two wings of the Liberals to become the Loyal Opposition for the first time ever. For over 200 years, the Liberals and Conservatives (and their antecedents; Tory and Whig parties) had been the UK's two major parties. However, the 1922 general election saw Labour overtake the Liberals in the political landscape. Labour and the Conservatives have been the UK's two major parties since then, and government has alternated only between the two parties ever since. The Liberals (now the Liberal Democrats) would not become a major force in UK politics again until 2010, when rebranded as the Liberal Democrats, they formed a coalition government with the Conservatives. However, the success proved to be an aberration and the Lib Dems were defeated in a landslide at the 2015 general election; going from 57 MPs to just 8. They were overtaken as the official UK third party by the Scottish National Party (SNP) in terms of seat numbers, following their landslide victory of 56 seats in Scotland. * 1932 Irish general election ‚Äî Fianna F√°il victory; √âamon de Valera President of the Executive Council ** This election resulted in Fianna F√°il, led by √âamon de Valera, becoming the largest party in D√°il √âireann for the first time. Fianna F√°il remained in power for the next sixteen years and remained the largest party in the lower house of the Oireachtas for the next 79 years, serving as the government more than 58 of those years. *1973 Danish general election ‚Äî Poul Hartling Prime Minister **The 1973 Danish general election is referred to as the Landslide Election (), as five new or previously unrepresented parties won seats, and more than half the members of the parliament were replaced. The Social Democratic Party, which had led a minority government until this election, lost one-third of their seats. After the election, Poul Hartling, the leader of the liberal Venstre, formed the smallest minority government in Danish history with only 22 seats, supported by the Progress Party, the Conservative People's Party, the Social Liberal Party, the Centre Democrats and the Christian People's Party. * 1979 United Kingdom general election ‚Äî Conservative victory; Margaret Thatcher Prime Minister ** This election brought the Conservatives into government where they remained for eighteen uninterrupted years. Thatcher's policies of monetarism and privatisation represented a very different strand of Conservatism to that of previous governments and a bold shift from the post-war consensus that had existed since 1945. The shockwaves led to a new centrist party being formed by some disenchanted Labour MPs (the SDP) in 1981, and a long period in opposition for Labour, during which; they abandoned many socialist policies (notably Clause IV which advocated common ownership) and were transformed into \\"New Labour\\" before they returned to government in a landslide victory at the 1997 general election under the leadership of Tony Blair. At a more base level, it led to a shift in voting patterns as the traditional class-based voting started to break down and many of the working classes (in particular skilled workers, homeowners and those in southern England) voted Conservative, whilst at the same time many public sector professionals shifted their support to Labour. * 1982 Spanish general election ‚Äî Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) victory ** This election saw the ruling Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD), the party that had shepherded the country through its transition to democracy, nearly wiped out. The UCD fell to only 11 seats, being replaced as the main non-socialist party by the People's Alliance (AP), and would dissolve itself as a party shortly after the election. The PSOE and AP‚Äîlater transformed into the People's Party (PP)‚Äîwould went on to dominate Spanish politics for the next three decades. At the same time, the PSOE would establish itself as the dominant party of Spanish politics until the 1996 general election. * 1994 Italian general election ‚Äî Forza Italia/Pole of Freedoms victory ** This election resulted in the near-destruction of the Italian People's Party (the renamed Christian Democrats), which had been the largest party in the country since 1946. The Italian Socialist Party, a major coalition partner for the last thirty years, was decimated as well. * 2005 Polish parliamentary election ** The elections resulted in a widely expected heavy defeat for the post- Communist Democratic Left Alliance government, with conservative parties such as Law and Justice and Civic Platform emerging as the dominant parties in Poland. * 2010 Hungarian parliamentary election ** The election resulted the landslide victory of the Fidesz, gaining a two-thirds majority, while long- time rival, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) had drastically weakened, ending the de facto two-party system. Two major parties of the \\"regime change\\", the MDF and the SZDSZ lost their all parliamentary seats. * 2011 Irish general election ** Fianna F√°il, who had governed Ireland for most of the post-independence era, were heavily defeated at the election following anger over the Irish financial crisis. For the first time, Fine Gael overtook Fianna F√°il to win the most votes and seats, while Fianna F√°il fell from first place to third place, in terms of both votes and seats. Fine Gael and the second largest party in the D√°il, the Labour Party formed a coalition government. * May 2012 Greek legislative election ** Greece's two main political parties since the restoration of democracy in 1974, New Democracy and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), saw a combined fall in support from nearly 80% in 2009 to just one-third for their role in supporting austerity measures to alleviate the Greek government-debt crisis. At this election, PASOK fell dramatically from first place to third place. This election also saw the shift of left-leaning support to the Eurosceptic Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) which has at been the forefront of opposition to the austerity measures and to the neoliberal economic policies of the European Union. * 2017 French presidential election ** Neither the mainstream left Socialist Party nor the mainstream right Republicans made the second round of voting, the first time since the Second World War that both of the formerly dominant strands of French politics have not been represented. Instead, the two leading candidates ‚Äì the eventual winner, centrist liberal pro-European Emmanuel Macron of En Marche and far-right Eurosceptic Marine Le Pen of the National Front ‚Äì were identified by many analysts as representing a new open‚Äìclosed political spectrum between conservative protectionism and liberal globalism. Latin America * 2002 Brazilian general election ‚Äî Lu√≠s In√°cio Lula da Silva President ** According to political theorist and former spokesman of the Brazilian Presidency (2003‚Äì2007) Andr√© Singer, the rise to power of the Worker's Party (PT) and the subsequent creation and expansion of income redistribution policies (Bolsa Fam√≠lia, minimum wage increases, etc.) has realigned the Brazilian political scene. Even in the event of an PT's electoral defeat, it is argued, no president would risk reverting Lula's programs, for fear of the reaction of the lower classes. Lula's victory in 2002 marked the beginning of the first left-wing government since 1964. * 1930 Colombian presidential election - Enrique Olaya Herrera President ** After a 44-year domination in national politics by the Conservative Party (since 1886), the division of the conservative ticket (along with the economic crisis and the Banana Massacre) caused the first victory of the Liberal Party in half a century. This was the start of the period known as \\"Liberal Republic\\", in which the liberals kept the presidency for 16 years. Furthermore, this also started a winning-strike in legislative elections that would last until 2006, with the liberals winning in all elections they participated in with either a majority or plurality, being the first force in Congress in 68 out of 75 years. * 1998 Venezuelan presidential election ‚Äî Hugo Ch√°vez Fr√≠as President **The result meant the end of the Puntofijismo that had dominated the political atmosphere of the country in the last 40 years and the beginning of the dominance of the new MVR party, later renamed PSUV. * 2018 Brazilian general election ‚Äî Jair Bolsonaro was elected President, ending 15 years of Workers Party rule. Anger over the previous administration's failure to tackle widespread corruption and other crises engulfing Brazil handed the conservative politician victory. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-presidential- candidate-181007020716337.html https://www.dw.com/en/far-right-jair-bolsonaro- wins-brazils-presidential-election/a-46065594 OceaniaAustralia= * 1910 Australian federal election ‚Äî Labor victory; Andrew Fisher Prime Minister ** The unification of the Protectionist Party and the Anti-Socialist Party (originally the Free Trade Party) into the Commonwealth Liberal Party earlier in 1909 made this election the first under what would become a two- party system. It also marked the first elected majority government federally. * 1949 Australian federal election ‚Äî Liberal victory; Robert Menzies Prime Minister ** The first time the Liberal Party won government federally (predecessors including the Commonwealth Liberal Party and the United Australia Party), and it marked the start of twenty-three years of Liberal government and sixteen years of Menzies as Prime Minister (he had earlier been PM for two years from 1939). No party has held government continuously for a longer, nor has anybody been Prime Minister for longer since then. * 1972 Australian federal election ‚Äì Labor victory; Gough Whitlam Prime Minister ** After twenty-three years of Liberal rule, the Labor Party took power in 1972, with the slogan, 'It's Time'. The significance of this election was broader than merely a change of partisan rule; new issues, such as the environment, Aboriginal affairs, abortion, multiculturalism, and a broader acceptance of state spending, resulted from the Whitlam government, which in many respects created a bipartisan consensus on major issues of social policy. Although the Whitlam government was relatively brief, its policy legacy‚Äîin creating new government policies for society and culture‚Äîlasted in many respects to the 1996 election, and even to the present day. * 1983 Australian federal election ‚Äì Labor victory; Bob Hawke Prime Minister ** Unseating the Fraser government, thirteen years of Labor government followed, marking the longest continuous Labor government and the longest period of the Coalition in opposition. * 1996 Australian federal election ‚Äì Liberal victory; John Howard Prime Minister ** The recent Australian political spectrum has consisted of two major parties, the conservative Liberal Party of Australia and the democratic socialist Australian Labor Party (ALP) although as of late Labor has been more aligned with the third way. This election followed Labor's re-election in the 1993 election which was termed the \\"unwinnable election\\" for the Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating. It marked the end of the Hawke/Keating Labor government which had been in power for 13 years. During this time the conservative Liberal party had undergone several failed leadership changes including Andrew Peacock in 1984 and 1990, John Howard in 1987 and John Hewson in 1993. The 1996 election saw the ALP lose 31 seats in the House of Representatives with a two-party-preferred result of 46.37%, the lowest for Labor since 1934. The 1996 election was significantly influenced by the demographic coined as the Howard's battlers. These were traditionally lower middle-class Labor party voters who felt that the ALP was no longer giving them the recognition they deserve. Notorious demographics which fell in 1996 were outer suburb mortgage belt areas. Howard's battlers played a part in the 2007 election where the ALP under Kevin Rudd was returned to power. Large gains made by Labor took place in many of former Liberal strongholds in the mortgage belt due to various issues common with the 1996 election in terms of general dissatisfaction as well as high interest rates. Queensland * 1915 Queensland state election ‚Äî Labor victory; T.J Ryan Premier of Queensland ** Labor forms majority government in Queensland for the first time, and would win 13 out of 14 state elections (the exception being in 1929) until the ALP-DLP split resulted in the expulsion of Labor Premier Vince Gair from the ALP in 1957. * 1957 Queensland state election ‚Äî Country/Liberal Coalition victory; Frank Nicklin Premier of Queensland ** The Country Party forms majority government in Queensland in coalition with the Liberal Party after the split of the ruling Labor Party. The Country Party would be in Government in Queensland for the next 32 years and 11 state elections during this period, with 19 years under the premiership of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen as the longest serving Premier of Queensland. The Country/National Party would even win a parliamentary majority in its own right at the Queensland state elections in 1983 and 1986, the only occasions where the party has governed a State or Territory of Australia without being in Coalition with the Liberal Party. * 1989 Queensland state election ‚Äî Labor victory; Wayne Goss Premier of Queensland. ** Labor forms majority government in Queensland for the first time since 1957, after the Fitzgerald Inquiry into police and political corruption results in the resignation of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and the collapse in support for the National Party which ruled from 1957 until 1989. Labor has won 10 out of the 11 Queensland state elections during this period, the exception being in 2012, only twice have the Liberal/National coalition formed government under Rob Borbidge (1996-1998) and Campbell Newman (2012-2015). =New Zealand= * 1890 New Zealand general election ‚Äì Liberal victory; John Ballance Prime Minister ** The coming to power of the Liberal Party is heralded as a major milestone in New Zealand history. It marked the beginning of proper party politics in New Zealand. While groupings of 'Liberal' and 'Conservative' politicians date back to the 1870s they were more akin to loose factions rather than properly organised parties. Massive economic and social reforms took place following 1890 with a progressive land tax partnered with leasehold sponsorship to stimulate agriculture which recovered the country from the Long Depression. Ballance's successor Richard Seddon carried on reforms concentrating largely on establishing welfare. Arguably the Liberal's most famous and important achievement was the enfranchisement of women, a major social upheaval which saw New Zealand become the first country in the world to allow women to vote. * 1935 New Zealand general election ‚Äì Labour victory; Michael Joseph Savage Prime Minister ** The 1935 election brought Labour to power for the first time. Huge economic change resulted from their entry into office at the height of the Great Depression which was to remain in place for half a century. A generous welfare system labeled as \\"social security\\" was instigated and the country's existing free market economy was completely abandoned in favour of a Keynesian based system with higher tariffs, guaranteed prices for producers and emphasis on local manufacturing to create jobs. The government was praised for their policies resulting in another landslide victory in 1938. The political landscape was also to change, with the three party era ending with the United and Reform parties (who had formed a coalition between 1931 and 1935) completely merging into the new National Party, who remain Labour's main rival to the present day, both occupying either government or opposition ever since. * 1984 New Zealand general election ‚Äì Labour victory; David Lange Prime Minister ** The election of the Labour Government under the leadership of David Lange and Roger Douglas, brought about radical economic reform, moving New Zealand from what had probably been one of the most protected, regulated and state-dominated system of any capitalist democracy to an extreme position at the open, competitive, free-market end of the spectrum. Social policies also took a dramatic change with New Zealand's largely socially conservative outlook being reshaped with more liberal outlooks in the Lange government's policy epitomised by policies such as the passing of anti-nuclear legislation and the legalisation of homosexuality. Foreign relations also changed dramatically with New Zealand abandoning their allegiances with the United States, largely over the issue of anti-nuclear policy, culminating in their exclusion from ANZUS by both the US and Australia. * 1996 New Zealand general election ‚Äì National‚ÄìNew Zealand First coalition victory; Jim Bolger Prime Minister ** The 1996 election was the first held under the new mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting system, introduced after two referendums in 1992 and 1993, and signalled the transition from the two-party era to a new multi-party era.

It is part of the U.S. state of Michigan. The island and the 450 surrounding smaller islands and waters make up Isle Royale National Park. Isle Royale is long and wide, with an area of , making it the fourth-largest lake island in the world. In addition, it is the largest natural island in Lake Superior, the second-largest island in the Great Lakes (after Manitoulin Island), the third-largest in the contiguous United States (after Long Island and Padre Island), and the 33rd-largest island in the United States. Isle Royale is defined by the United States Census Bureau as Census Tract 9603 of Keweenaw County, Michigan. As of the 2000 census there was no permanent population. After the island was made a national park, some existing residents were allowed to stay, and a few leases are still in effect. Geography In 1875, Isle Royale was set off from Keweenaw County, as a separate county, \\"Isle Royale County\\". In 1897, the county was dissolved, and the island was reincorporated into Keweenaw County. The highest point on the island is Mount Desor at , or about above lake level. Isle Royale is within about of the Canadian and Minnesotan shores of the lake, (near the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario), and is from the Michigan shore, on the Keweenaw Peninsula. There are no roads on the island, and wheeled vehicles or devices, other than wheelchairs, are not permitted. Rock Harbor has wheeled carts available to move personal belongings from the Rock Harbor marina to the cabins and hotel. Also, the National Park Service employs tractors and utility terrain vehicles to move items around the developed areas at Windigo, Rock Harbor, and Mott Island. Topsoil tends to be thin, which favors trees that have horizontal root patterns such as balsam fir, white spruce, and black spruce. Interior lakes Siskiwit Lake is the largest lake on the island. It has cold, clear water which is relatively low in nutrients. Siskiwit Lake contains several islands, including Ryan Island, the largest. *Chicken Bone Lake *Lake Desor *Feldtmann Lake *Intermediate Lake (Isle Royale) *Lake Ritchie *Sargent Lake Climate Source climate data for Isle Royale is lacking, particularly for the winter season, though general summaries of seasonal variations are available and data from nearby areas have been used to derive deductions for purposes of scientific study. For example, see the monthly temperature and precipitation table on the Isle Royale National Park page. Geology Isle Royale boasts the purest copper to be found anywhere in the world. A large volcanic event in the distant past twisted the copper- bearing bedrock above the water line, which permitted all sulfur impurities to burn away in the open air. Cross-section of the Lake Superior basin showing the tilted strata of volcanic rock that form Isle Royale The island is composed largely of ridges, running roughly southwest-to-northeast. The main ridge, Greenstone Ridge, is over in many places. Greenstone belts are exposed, with rounded stones of chlorastrolite, also known as greenstone, near and in the lake. MODIS image of Isle Royale According to the National Park Service, the north sides of the ridges tend to be steeper than the south sides. Coastal areas were once submerged beneath prehistoric lake waters, and contain many tumbled boulders and other large rocks. History The island was a common hunting ground for native people from nearby Minnesota and Ontario. A canoe voyage of thirteen miles is necessary to reach the island's west end from the mainland. In prehistoric times, large quantities of copper were mined on Isle Royale and the nearby Keweenaw Peninsula. The region is scarred by ancient mine pits and trenches up to 20 feet deep. Carbon-14 testing of wood remains found in sockets of copper artifacts indicates that they are at least 5700 years old. In Prehistoric Copper Mining in the Lake Superior Region, published in 1961, Drier and Du Temple estimated that over 750,000 tons of copper had been mined from the region. However, David Johnson and Susan Martin contend that their estimate was based on exaggerated and inaccurate assumptions. In 1670, a Jesuit missionary named Dablon published an account of \\"an island called Menong, celebrated for its copper.\\" Menong, or Minong, was the native term for the island, and is the basis for the name of the Minong Ridge on the island. Isle Royale was given to the United States by the 1783 treaty with Great Britain, but the British remained in control until after the War of 1812, and the Ojibwa peoples considered the island to be their territory. The Ojibwas ceded the island to the U.S. in the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe, with the Grand Portage Band unaware that neither they nor Isle Royale were in British territory. With the clarification to the Ojibwas of the 1842 Webster‚ÄìAshburton Treaty that was signed before the Treaty of La Pointe, the Ojibwas re-affirmed the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe in the 1844 Isle Royale Agreement, with the Grand Portage Band signing the agreement as an addendum to the 1842 treaty. In the mid-1840s, a report by Douglass Houghton, Michigan's first state geologist, set off a copper boom in the state, and the first modern copper mines were opened on the island. Evidence of the earlier mining efforts was everywhere, in the form of many stone hammers, some copper artifacts, and places where copper had been partially worked out of the rock but left in place. The ancient pits and trenches led to the discovery of many of the copper deposits that were mined in the 19th century. The remoteness of the island, combined with the small veins of copper, caused most of the 19th-century mines to fail quickly. Between the miners and commercial loggers, much of the island was deforested during the late 19th century. Once the island became a national park in 1940, logging and other exploitive activities ended, and the forest began to regenerate. The island was once the site of several lake trout and whitefish fisheries, as well as a few resorts. Today, it has no permanent inhabitants; the small communities of Scandinavian fishermen were removed by the United States National Park Service (NPS) after the island became a national park in the 1940s. About 12 families have lifetime leases for their cabins and claim Isle Royale as their heritage, and several descendant fishermen fish the Isle Royale waters commercially. The western tip of the island is home to several shipwrecks that are very popular with scuba divers, including the SS America. The NPS Submerged Resources Center mapped the 10 most famous of the shipwrecks contained within the park, and published Shipwrecks of Isle Royale National Park; The Archeological Survey, which gives an overview of the maritime history of the area. National Park The island and the 450 surrounding smaller islands and waters make up Isle Royale National Park. It is the least visited national park in the lower 48 states. Recreational activities Beach near mouth of Washington Creek Recreational activity on Isle Royale includes hiking, backpacking, fishing, boating, canoeing, kayaking, and observing nature. Wheeled vehicles are not permitted on Isle Royale, such as bicycles or canoe portage devices; however, wheelchairs are allowed.http://www.nps.gov/isro/faqs.htm \\"Is there off-road biking on the Isle?\\" Retrieved May 10, 2014. There are numerous campgrounds, many of which are only accessible by water. There are two small settlements on the island proper: Rock Harbor, which has a resort, a marina, and basic amenities, and Windigo, a smaller facility on the far western end of the island. Both Rock Harbor and Windigo have paid showers and provisions available. A typical National Park Service campground consists of a few shelters (cabin-like structures with one wall of mosquito-proof screen), individual tent sites with picnic table, and group camping sites. There are one or more pit toilets at each facility. Campgrounds along the shore have a boat dock and overnight boaters are a common sight at some campgrounds. Waterfront locations also attract canoeists and kayakers. No wells are available, thus all water is usually filtered or thoroughly boiled to prevent infection by parasites and bacteria. Beach at Huginnin Cove camp area View from the top of Mount Franklin looking north Hiking The island offers approximately of hiking trails for everything from day hikes to a two-week circumnavigation hike. Some of the hiking trails are quite challenging, with steep grades. \\"The most popular, best marked and longest single route ...is the 40-mile Greenstone Ridge Trail that extends down the island's backbone.\\" The trail leads to the peak of Mount Desor, at , the highest point on the island, and passes through northwoods wilderness, and by inland glacial lakes, swamps, bogs and scenic shorelines. Ecology A number of habitats exist on the island, the primary being boreal forest, similar to neighboring Ontario and Minnesota. Upland areas along some of the ridges are effectively \\"balds\\" with exposed bedrock and a few scrubby trees, blueberry bushes, and hardy grasses. Occasional marshes exist, which are typically the by-product of beaver activities. There are also several lakes, often with wooded or marshy shores. The climate, especially in lowland areas, is heavily influenced by the cold waters of Lake Superior. The island is well known among ecologists as the site of a long-term study of a predator-prey system, between moose and eastern timber wolves. L. David Mech began this study in 1958 as a graduate student at Purdue University.The Far Reach: The lifework of a Minnesota biologist circles the world by Greg Breining Pages 32-41 Minnesota Department of Resources Conservation Volunteer Magazine. January‚ÄìFebruary 2004 There is a cyclical relationship between the two animals: as the moose increase in population, so do the wolves. Eventually, the wolves kill too many moose and begin to starve and lower their reproductive rates.National Park Service. Retrieved May 10, 2014. Historically neither moose nor wolves inhabited Isle Royale. Just prior to becoming a national park the largest mammals on Isle Royale were Canadian Lynx and the Boreal woodland caribou. Archeological evidence indicates both of these species were present on Isle Royale for 3,500 years prior to being removed by direct human actions (hunting, trapping, mining, logging, fires and possibly the introduction of invasive species). The last Boreal woodland caribou documented on Isle Royale was in 1925. Though Canadian Lynx were removed by the 1930s some have periodically crossed the ice bridge from neighboring Ontario, Canada, the most recent being an individual sighting in 1980.https://www.nps.gov/isro/learn/nature/upload/Mammals_ver7.pdf Though Lynx are no longer present on the island, their primary prey, snowshoe hares, remain. Before the appearance of wolves, coyotes were also a predator on the island. Coyotes appeared around 1905 and disappeared shortly after wolves arrived in the 1950s. Four wolves were brought from Minnesota in 2018. after some debate as to whether or not the introduction was an unnatural intervention.A Reasonable Illusion by Conor Mihell Sierra Club magazine November/December 2018 issue Pages 30-35 Other common mammals are red foxes, beavers, and red squirrels. Some foxes are quite used to human contact, and can be seen prowling the campgrounds at dawn, looking for stray scraps left by unwary campers. For its part, the wolf is an elusive species which avoids human interaction. Few documented cases of direct wolf/human contact exist. Ermine have been periodically sighted around docks. Other mammals that can be seen include mink (along the various lake shores) and muskrats (occasionally at beaver ponds). Several species of bat also exist on the island. Reptiles include the eastern garter snake, painted turtle, and northern redbelly snake. Six species of frogs and three species of salamander also live on the island. Travel to Isle Royale Isle Royale Queen IV at Copper Harbor The island is accessible by private boat, seaplane, three private commercial ferries, and a National Park Service ferry. Scheduled ferry service generally runs May through September: * From Houghton, Michigan, the Ranger III, operated by the National Park Service, makes daily round trips to Rock Harbor . * From Copper Harbor, Michigan, the Isle Royale Queen IV makes daily round trips to Rock Harbor. * From Grand Portage, Minnesota: Sea Hunter III makes daily round trips to Windigo.

The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs. Creating lead guitar lines To create lead guitar lines, guitarists use scales, modes, arpeggios, licks, and riffs that are performed using a variety of techniques. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz and fusion bands and some pop contexts as well as others, lead guitar lines often employ alternate picking, sweep picking, economy picking and legato (e.g., hammer ons, pull offs), which are used to maximize the speed of their solos or riffs. Such \\"tricks\\" can employ the picking hand used in the fret area (such as tapping), and even be augmented and embellished with devices such as bows, or separate electronic devices such as an EBow (electronic bow). Some guitarists occasionally use skills that combine technique and showmanship, such as playing the guitar behind their head or picking with the front teeth. In a blues context, as well as others, guitarists sometimes create leads that use call and response-style riffs that they embellish with string bending, vibrato, and slides. Jazz guitar soloing Jazz guitarists integrate the basic building blocks of scales and arpeggio patterns into balanced rhythmic and melodic phrases that make up a cohesive solo. Jazz guitarists often try to imbue their melodic phrasing with the sense of natural breathing and legato phrasing used by horn players such as saxophone players. As well, a jazz guitarists' solo improvisations have to have a rhythmic drive and \\"timefeel\\" that creates a sense of \\"swing\\" and \\"groove.\\" The most experienced jazz guitarists learn to play with different \\"timefeels\\" such as playing \\"ahead of the beat\\" or \\"behind the beat,\\" to create or release tension. Another aspect of the jazz guitar style is the use of stylistically appropriate ornaments, such as grace notes, slides, and muted notes. Each subgenre or era of jazz has different ornaments that are part of the style of that subgenre or era. Jazz guitarists usually learn the appropriate ornamenting styles by listening to prominent recordings from a given style or jazz era. Some jazz guitarists also borrow ornamentation techniques from other jazz instruments, such as Wes Montgomery's borrowing of playing melodies in parallel octaves, which is a jazz piano technique. Jazz guitarists also have to learn how to add in passing tones, use \\"guide tones\\" and chord tones from the chord progression to structure their improvisations. In the 1970s and 1980s, with jazz-rock fusion guitar playing, jazz guitarists incorporated rock guitar soloing approaches, such as riff-based soloing and usage of pentatonic and blues scale patterns. Some guitarists used Jimi Hendrix-influenced distortion and wah-wah effects to get a sustained, heavy tone, or even used rapid-fire guitar shredding techniques, such as tapping and tremolo bar bending. Guitarist Al Di Meola, who started his career with Return to Forever in 1974, was one of the first guitarists to perform in a \\"shred\\" style, a technique later used in rock and heavy metal playing. Di Meola used alternate-picking to perform very rapid sequences of notes in his solos. When jazz guitar players improvise, they use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression. The approach to improvising has changed since the earliest eras of jazz guitar. During the Swing era, many soloists improvised \\"by ear\\" by embellishing the melody with ornaments and passing notes. However, during the bebop era, the rapid tempo and complicated chord progressions made it increasingly harder to play \\"by ear.\\" Along with other improvisers, such as saxes and piano players, bebop-era jazz guitarists began to improvise over the chord changes using scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) and arpeggios.Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians, by Robert Rawlins, Nor Eddine Bahha, Barrett Tagliarino. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2005 , . Page 141 Jazz guitar players tend to improvise around chord/scale relationships, rather than reworking the melody, possibly due to their familiarity with chords resulting from their comping role. A source of melodic ideas for improvisation is transcribing improvised solos from recordings. This provides jazz guitarists with a source of \\"licks\\", melodic phrases and ideas they incorporate either intact or in variations, and is an established way of learning from the previous generations of players Role in a band In a band with two guitars, there can be a logical division between lead and rhythm guitars although that division may be unclear. Two guitarists may perform as a guitar tandem, and trade off the lead guitar and rhythm guitar roles. Alternatively, two or more guitarists can share the lead and rhythm roles throughout the show, or both guitarists can play the same role (\\"dual lead guitars\\" or \\"dual rhythm guitars\\"). Often several guitarists playing individual notes may create chord patterns while mixing these \\"harmonies\\" with mixed unison passages creating unique sound effects with sound altering electronic special effects such as doublers or a \\"chorus\\" effect that over-pronounce the lead significantly sometimes to cut through to be heard in loud shows or throw its sound aesthetically both acoustically or electronically. Effects and equipment In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz and fusion bands and some pop contexts as well as others, the lead guitar line often involves melodies (as well as power chords from the rhythm guitars) with a sustained, singing tone. To create this tone on the electric guitar, guitarists often select certain pickups and use electronic effects such as effects pedals and distortion pedals, or sound compressors, or doubler effects for a more sustained tone, and delay effects or an electronic \\"chorus\\" effect as well as electronic reverb and echo for a reverberant sound. To attain this sustain effect guitarists often use tube amplifiers such as those from Marshall or Fender. The tube effect comes from the way amplifying tubes distort when pushed to the limits of their amplification power. As the guitar signal's waveform reaches the amplifier's limits, amplification decreases‚Äîrounding off the top of the waveform. This amounts to compression of individual wave cycles, and is pleasing to the ear. High volume can induce audio feedback, which a guitarist can control to dramatically increase sustain. By holding the guitar at a certain distance and angle from the amplifier speakers, a guitarist can create a continuous, undecaying sound. Electronic special effects that use effects loops can artificially reproduce this. Other effects that embellish lead guitar tone and pitch include the vibrato bar which physically alters string tension, slides, and wah-wah and univibe effects.

She is best remembered for playing Do√±a Clotilde \\"La Bruja del 71\\" in the sitcom El Chavo del Ocho. She was an anti-Franco refugee who remained in Mexico (in addition to a brief stint in Cuba) from 1947 until the end of her life. Career She made her acting debut in the musical comedy Carlo Monte en Monte Carlo in Isabela Garc√©s' theatre company in Madrid. She flew to Mexico in 1947 in fear for her life due to her support for the Spanish Maquis. During the Spanish Civil War, young Fern√°ndez was supportive of the Republican faction. She would remain in Mexico for the rest of her life, except for international tours and a short stint in Cuba during the late 1940s. In 1950, she returned to Mexico permanently. Angelines Fern√°ndez starred in fourteen films, including the classic El Esqueleto de la se√±ora Morales (1960). In 1964, she took the supporting role of Sara, the nemesis of Cantinflas's character Padre Sebasti√°n, in El padrecito. She starred in Cadenas de amor at the age of 37, and other telenovelas in the 1960s with the second to last one in 1970. It was not until she was hired in 1973 to play \\"La Bruja del 71\\" in El Chavo del Ocho that she cemented her status as a legend. She got that job when she asked her personal friend, Ram√≥n Vald√©s, if he knew of any acting jobs she might be able to do. She also participated in Chespiritos other show, El Chapul√≠n Colorado, years later. It was with El Chavo del Ocho and El Chapul√≠n Colorado that she achieved fame in her native Spain. The two Chespirito productions became wide international hits, reaching virtually every country in the Americas and also other, non-Spanish speaking, countries as well. The shows are still shown with re-runs in many countries. In 1974, she participated in her last telenovela and her last film and concentrated her work around Chespirito productions. After the shows ended in 1979, she continued playing \\"La Bruja\\" on the hour- long Chespirito and on public tours. Starting later in the 1980s, she began playing Ignacia Fern√°ndez \\"Do√±a Nachita\\", a second regular character on Chespirito, the gossipy neighbor in the Los caquitos sketches. She remained on the show until 1992. Death An acknowledged tobacco smoker, she died on 25 March 1994 from a tobacco related cancer (sources mention it being throat cancer without giving further details). She is buried at the Mausoleos del √Ångel in Mexico City. She was 69 years old.

The word is borrowed from Italian (an adjective meaning mandatory; from Latin obligatus p.p. of obligare, to oblige); the spelling obligato is not acceptable in British English,\\"Obbligato\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Music, Oxford University Press: Michael Kennedy (ed.), 1985 but it is often used as an alternative spelling in the US. The word can stand on its own, in English, as a noun, or appear as a modifier in a noun phrase (e.g. organ obbligato). Independence Obbligato includes the idea of independence, as in C.P.E. Bach's 1780 Symphonies \\"mit zw√∂lf obligaten Stimmen\\" (\\"with twelve obbligato parts\\") by which Bach was referring to the independent woodwind parts he was using for the first time. These parts were also obbligato in the sense of being indispensable. Continuo In connection with a keyboard part in the baroque period, obbligato has a very specific meaning: it describes a functional change from a basso continuo part (in which the player decided how to fill in the harmonies unobtrusively) to a fully written part of equal importance to the main melody part. Contradictory usage A later use has the contradictory meaning of optional, indicating that a part was not obligatory.\\"Obbligato\\" in Lectionary of Music, Nicolas Slonimsky. McGraw-Hill A difficult passage in a concerto might be furnished by the editor with an easier alternative called the obbligato; or a work may have a part for one or more solo instruments, marked obbligato (but more commonly and correctly termed an ossia), that is decorative rather than essential; the piece is complete and can be performed without the added part.\\"Obbligato\\" in Collins Music Encyclopedia, Westrup & Harrison: Collins, London, 1959 The traditional term for such a part is ad libitum, or ad lib., or simply optional, since ad lib. may have a wide variety of interpretations. Contemporary usage In classical music the term has fallen out of use by modern-day practitioners, as composers, performers and audiences alike have come to see the musical text as paramount in decisions of musical execution. As a result, everything is now seen as obbligato unless explicitly specified otherwise in the score. It is still used to denote an orchestral piece with an instrumental solo part that stands out, but is not as prominent as in a solo concerto, as in Bloch's Concerto Grosso mentioned below. The term is now used mainly to discuss music of the past. One contemporary usage, however, is that by Erik Satie in the third movement of \\"Embryons dess√©ch√©s\\" (\\"Desiccated Embryos\\"), where the obbligato consists of around twenty F-major chords played at fortissimo (this is satirising Beethoven's symphonic style). The term is also used with an entirely different meaning, signifying a countermelody. Examples=Explicit instances *J.S.

Various etymologies have been proposed for the name \\"El Tatio\\", which might mean \\"oven\\" or \\"grandfather\\". It is the third-largest geyser field in the world and the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. El Tatio lies at the western foot of a series of stratovolcanoes, which run along the border between Chile and Bolivia. This series of volcanoes is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of several volcanic belts in the Andes, and there are no recorded historical eruptions at the Tatio volcanoes. El Tatio is also part of the Altiplano‚ÄìPuna volcanic complex (APVC), a system of large calderas and associated ignimbrites, which have been the sources of supereruptions. Some of these calderas may be the source of heat for the El Tatio geothermal system. El Tatio is a geothermal field with many geysers, hot springs, and associated sinter deposits. These hot springs eventually form the Rio Salado, a major tributary of the Rio Loa, and a major source of arsenic pollution in the river. The vents are sites of populations of extremophile microorganisms and have been studied as analogs for the early Earth and possible past life on Mars. The field is a major tourism destination in northern Chile. It was prospected over the last century for the potential of geothermal power production, but development efforts were discontinued after a major incident in 2009 in which drilling well blew out, creating a steam column.  Name and research history  The term \\"tatio\\" is Kunza and means \\"to appear\\", \\"oven\\", but it has also been translated as \\"grandfather\\" or \\"burnt\\". The geyser field is also known as the Copacoya geysers. The earliest mentions of geysers in the region are from the late 19th century, and they were already well known by 1952. The first geothermal prospecting of the field occurred in the 1920s and the field was mentioned in academic literature in 1943, but more systematic research took place in 1967‚Äì1982; most research on this geothermal field was done in the context of geothermal prospecting.  Geomorphology and geography  { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Geyser El Tatio\\", \\"marker-color\\": \\"#ff0000\\", \\"marker- size\\": \\"medium\\", }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ -68.010278, -22.331389 ] } } ] }El Tatio lies in the Antofagasta Province of northern Chile close to the border between Chile and Bolivia. The field is located \\\\- north of the town San Pedro de Atacama and east of the town of Calama; Chile Route B-245 connects El Tatio to San Pedro de Atacama. Towns close to El Tatio are Toconce to the north, Caspana to the west, Machuca to the south and a workers' camp for a sulfur mine at Volcan Tatio, which was reported to exist in 1959. The old Inca trail from San Pedro de Atacama to Siloli crossed the geyser field; the Inca also operated a mountain sanctuary on Volcan Tatio. There are several unpaved roads and all parts of the field are easily accessible. El Tatio is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, a segment of the Andes between 14¬∞ and 28¬∞ southern latitude where the Andes are volcanically active. This volcanism manifests itself with about 10 silicic caldera complexes of the Altiplano‚ÄìPuna volcanic complex and more than 50 recently active volcanoes; Lascar in 1993 erupted and produced a tall eruption column. Andesitic stratovolcanoes reaching elevations of about are found at El Tatio east of the field, while the Sierra de Tucle lies to the southwest of it. From north to south the andesitic stratovolcanoes include the or high Cerro Deslinde which is the highest in the area, the high Cerro El Volcan, the high Cordillera del Tatio and the high Volcan Tatio, and they collectively form the El Tatio volcanic group. The geothermal field of El Tatio lies in a graben between the stratovolcanoes in the east and the Serrania de Tucle-Loma Lucero horst in the west. Mountains southwest of El Tatio include the Alto Ojo del Cablor, while high Cerro Copacoya is situated northwest of the geothermal field. Dacitic volcanism, older than the easterly stratovolcanoes, has occurred west of El Tatio; this volcanism was known as the \\"liparitic formation\\" and it covers large areas in the region. Firn and snow fields were reported in the middle 20th century on the El Tatio volcanic group, at elevations of . The region is too dry to support glaciers today, but in the past higher moisture allowed their formation on mountains of this part of the Andes; glacially eroded mountains and moraines testify to their existence in the form of large valley glaciers. A large moraine complex, including both terminal structures and well-developed lateral moraines, can be found north of the geyser field and reflects the existence of a long glacier, the longest valley glacier in the region. Two more moraine systems extend westward both northeast and southeast of El Tatio, and the terrain surrounding the geyser field is covered by sands that are interpreted as glacial outwash sands. Dating the moraines has yielded ages consistent with or preceding the last glacial maximum. Drainage in the area is generally from east to west down the Western Cordillera, often in form of steeply incised valleys. The Rio Salado drains most of the hot spring water and has its headwaters in the field where it is joined by the Rio Tucle. Temperature measurements of the water flowing to the Rio Salado have yielded values of , while the discharge of the Rio Salado amounts to . The Rio Salado eventually joins the Rio Loa, a major source of freshwater for the region; thus, El Tatio plays an important role in the regional water supply.  Geothermal field  El Tatio is well known as a geothermal field in Chile, and is the largest geyser field in the southern hemisphere with about 8% of all geysers in the world and is (together with Sol de Ma√±ana) the highest geyser field in the world. Only Yellowstone in the United States and Dolina Geizerov in Russia are larger and their geysers are taller than these at El Tatio. The Andes rise behind El Tatio The geothermal field covers an area of at elevations of , and is characterized by fumaroles, hot springs, steam vents known as soffioni and steaming soil. Stronger geothermal activity is located within three discrete areas covering a total of surface, and includes boiling water fountains, hot springs, geysers, mudpots, mud volcanoes and sinter terraces; further, chimneys of extinct geysers have been noted. One of these three areas lies within a valley, the second on a flat surface and the third along the banks of the Rio Salado. The first area offers a notable contrast between the snow-covered Andes, the coloured hills that surround the field and the white deposits left by the geothermal activity. Most geysers of El Tatio are found here and are particularly noticeable in cold weather. A similar landscape exists at the third (lower) area, with the presence of the Rio Salado river adding an additional element to the landscape. The second area is located between a creek and a hill and includes an artificial pool for tourists. The field once numbered 67 geysers and more than three hundred hot springs. Many vents are linked to fractures that run northwest-southeast or southwest-northeast across the field. Some geyser fountains reached heights greater than ; usually, however, they do not exceed and their activity sometimes varies over time. A few geysers have received names, such as Boiling Geyser, El Cobreloa, El Cobresal, El Jefe, Terrace Geyser, Tower Geyser and Vega Rinconada. An additional geothermal system lies southeast of and at elevations above El Tatio and is characterized by steam-heated ponds fed by precipitation water, and solfataric activity has been reported on the stratovolcanoes farther east. The sinter landscape formed at El Tatio Deposition of sinter from the waters of the geothermal field has given rise to spectacular landforms, including, but not limited to mounds, terraced pools, geyser cones and the dams that form their rims. Small scale features include cones, crusts, mollusc-shaped formations, waterfall-like surfaces and very small terraces. These sinter deposits cover an area of about and include both active and inactive deposits, both of which were emplaced on glacial sediments. High contents of silica give the waters a blueish colour, organic compounds such as carotenoids conversely often colour the sinter with orange-brown, and greenish hues are owing to iron-oxidizing bacteria. * Hot springs form pools with water temperatures of , which are often gently moving and surging and in the case of the warmer springs actively bubbling. These pools often contain ball-like rocks called oncoids and are surrounded by sinter rims, which have spicule-like textures. These sinter rims often form dam-like structures around deeper vents which are filled with water. Spherical grains develop in the hot springs as a consequence of hydrodynamic processes, and include biogenic material; during the growth of the sinter they often end up embedded in the material. * Flowing water that drains from the springs deposits sinter, which can form fairly thick deposits and large aprons when sheet flow occurs, known as \\"discharge deposits\\"; sometimes terraces are developed instead. As in springs, oncoids and spicules are observed in channels. Much of the water evaporates and its temperature drops from to less than away from the springs; the low air temperatures cause it to freeze occasionally, resulting in frost weathering. * Geysers and also water fountains discharge from up to high cones with gently sloping surfaces, which sometimes support splash mounds and are constructed by geyserite. Other geysers and fountains instead discharge from within rim-bounded pools, and some geysers are located on the bed of the Rio Salado river. The activity of geysers is not stable over time, changes in water supply or in the properties of the conduit that supplies them can cause changes in their eruptive activity. Such changes can be triggered by rainfall events or earthquakes and at El Tatio geyser behaviour changes have been linked to the 2014 Iquique earthquake and a 2013 precipitation event. The water of geysers is warm. * Mud pools are often bubbling, with the hot mud fountaining. Simmering pools of water have been recorded at El Tatio as well.

Volcanism does not occur along the entire length of the Andes; there are three volcanic zones called the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone and the Southern Volcanic Zone, all separated by areas with no recent volcanism. El Tatio and a number of other geothermal fields such as Sol de Ma√±ana are part of the Altiplano‚ÄìPuna volcanic complex. The region was dominated by andesitic volcanism producing lava flows until the late Miocene, then large scale ignimbrite activity took place between 10 and 1 million years ago. This ignimbrite volcanism is part of the APVC proper and produced about of ignimbrites, covering a surface area of . The APVC activity continued into the Holocene with the emission of voluminous lava domes and lava flows, and Tatio was one of the last volcanic centres in the APVC to erupt; the present- day uplift of the Uturunku volcano in Bolivia may signal ongoing activity of the APVC. The Laguna Colorada caldera lies east of El Tatio. The terrain at El Tatio is formed by Jurassic‚ÄìCretaceous sediments of marine and volcanic origin, Tertiary‚ÄìHolocene volcanic formations that were emplaced in various episodes, and recent sediments formed by glaciers, alluvium, colluvium and material formed by the geothermal field, such as sinter. Volcanic formations fill the Tatio graben, including the Miocene Rio Salado ignimbrite and related volcanics which reach thicknesses of in some places, the Sifon ignimbrite, the Pliocene Puripicar ignimbrite and the Pleistocene Tatio ignimbrite; the Puripicar ignimbrite crops out farther west. Active volcanoes in the area include Putana and Tocorpuri. Hydrothermal alteration of country rock has occurred at El Tatio, it has yielded large deposits of alteration minerals such as illite, nobleite, smectite, teruggite and ulexite. Likewise, the summit parts of several volcanoes of the El Tatio volcanic group have been bleached and discoloured by hydrothermal activity.  Hydrology  Most of the water that is discharged by the hot springs appears to be precipitation, which enters the ground east and southeast of El Tatio. The source of heat of the whole complex appears to be the Laguna Colorada caldera, the El Tatio volcanic group or the Cerro Guacha and Pastos Grandes calderas. The movement of the water in the ground is controlled by the permeability of the volcanic material and the Serrania de Tucle‚ÄìLoma Lucero tectonic block west of El Tatio that acts as an obstacle. As it moves through the ground, it acquires heat and minerals and loses steam through evaporation. Unlike geothermal fields in wetter parts of the world, given the dry climate of the area, local precipitation has little influence on the hot springs hydrology at El Tatio. The time the water takes to traverse the whole path from precipitation to the springs is about 15 years. The water travels through a number of aquifers that correspond to permeable rock formations, such as the Salado and Puripicar ignimbrites, as well as through faults and fractures in the rock. Magmatic brine is mixed into this water and the mixture ultimately becomes the water that emerges at El Tatio. Two separate geothermal reservoirs have been identified, one encompassing the Salado and Puripicar ignimbrites and the other a dacite, the Tucle dacite. The Puripicar ignimbrite appears to be the main hydrothermal reservoir, with temperatures reaching . The total heat output of El Tatio is about . The hydrothermal system beneath El Tatio appears to extend to the neighbouring La Torta de Tocorpuri system. Depending on the season, the hot springs yield of water at temperatures reaching the local boiling point. The water is rich in minerals, especially sodium chloride and silica. Other compounds and elements in ascending tendency are antimony, rubidium, strontium, bromine, magnesium, caesium, lithium, arsenic, sulfate, boron, potassium and calcium. Some of these minerals are toxic, especially arsenic which pollutes a number of waters in the region. Arsenic concentrations in waters at El Tatio can reach - ‚Äì among the highest concentrations found in hot springs of the whole world - and in sediments. Producing about , El Tatio is a principal source of arsenic in the Rio Loa system, and arsenic pollution in the region has been linked to health issues in the population. Composition of these hot springs is not uniform in El Tatio, with chloride content decreasing from the northern springs over the southwestern ones to the eastern springs, where sulfate is more frequent. This sulfate enrichment appears to be driven by the steam-driven evaporation of the hot spring water, with the sulfate forming when hydrogen sulfide is oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. The decreasing chloride content on the other hand appears to be due to drainage coming from the east diluting the southern and western and especially eastern spring systems.  Fumaroles  Steam vents are particularly noticeable in the morning hours when the steam columns emanating from them are particularly visible, and temperatures of have been found. Carbon dioxide is the most important fumarole gas, followed by hydrogen sulfide. The amount of water relative to these two gases is variable, probably due to condensation of water in the ground. Additional components include argon, helium, hydrogen, methane, neon, nitrogen and oxygen. Characteristically for fumarole gases on convergent plate boundaries, much of this nitrogen is non-atmospheric, although atmospheric air is also involved in generating the chemistry of the El Tatio fumarole gases.  Composition of spring deposits  Opal is the most important component of sinter associated with hot springs; halite, sylvite and realgar are less common. This dominance of opal is because usually conditions favour its precipitation from water but not of other minerals, and it occurs both in subaqueous environments and on surfaces that are only occasionally wetted. During the precipitation, the opal forms tiny spheres which can aggregate as well as glassy deposits. Halite and other evaporites are more commonly encountered on the sinter surfaces outside of the hot springs, and while opal dominates in these environments as well sassolite and teruggite are found in addition to the aforementioned four minerals in the discharge deposits. Volcanic rock fragments such as plagioclase and quartz are found within cavities of the sinter. Cahnite has also been identified in sinter deposits. Finally, antimony, arsenic and calcium form sulfidic deposits in some springs. Microorganisms and material like pollen is found integrated within the sinter deposits. The rate at which sinter is deposited has been estimated at .  Climate and biology  The climate is dry with most precipitation falling between December and March, a precipitation pattern mediated by the South American monsoon. The region is additionally rather windy with mean windspeeds of , which influence the hot springs by enhancing evaporation. The evaporation rates per month reach and they facilitate the deposition of sinters. Apart from precipitation, the area is characterized by extreme temperature variations between day and night which can reach . The Chilean Direcci√≥n General del Agua operates a weather station at El Tatio; according to data from this station air temperatures average and precipitation . El Tatio further features high ultraviolet (UV) insolation. The whole Central Andes were wetter in the past, resulting in the formation of lakes such as Lake Tauca in the Altiplano. This, and a colder climate, resulted in the development of glaciers at El Tatio, which have left moraines. Surface exposure dating indicates that some moraines were emplaced at or before the Last Glacial Maximum and others in a time period 35,000 to 40,000 years before present. Landscape of the El Tatio region The dry grassland vegetation of the region is classified as Central Andean dry puna. Tussock grasses like Anatherostipa, Festuca and Stipa occur at elevation, while rosette and cushion plants reach elevations of ; these include Azorella, Chaetanthera, Mulinum, Senecio, Lenzia, Pycnophyllum and Valeriana. Riparian vegetation occurs along the Rio Salado. Among the animals in the region are chinchillas and viscachas and llamas, mainly the vicu√±a.  Spring biology  The geothermal field El Tatio is populated by various plants, microbes and animals. The vents are an extreme environment, given the presence of arsenic, the large amount of UV radiation that El Tatio receives and its high elevation. Hot springs have characteristic microbial communities associated with them that leave characteristic fossil traces in the spring deposits; environmental conditions on the early Earth resembled these of hot springs with potentially high UV radiation exposure, as the ozone layer did not yet exist and life probably developed within such conditions. In addition, microbial metabolism of arsenic influences its toxicity and the effects of arsenic pollution.  Microorganisms  Biofilms and microbial mats are omnipresent at El Tatio, including Calothrix, Leptolyngbya, Lyngbya and Phormidium cyanobacteria, which form mats within the hot springs covering the solid surfaces, including oncoids and the sinter. In other places, the aforementioned three genera form stromatolithic structures. Chroococcidiopsis is another cyanobacterium that can be found in hot waters of El Tatio, and non-cyanobacteria bacteria have also been found in the mats and sinter. There is a thermal gradation of microorganisms, with the hottest waters supporting Chloroflexus green bacteria and hyperthermophiles, cyanobacteria at less than water temperature and diatoms at even lower temperatures. Microbial mats have been found at other hot springs in the world such as Yellowstone and Steamboat Springs, both in the United States, and New Zealand, but they are thinner at El Tatio. These mats often have their organic material replaced with opal and thus end up forming much of the sinter, which has thus characteristic biogenix textures, such as filaments and laminae. Such biogenic textures have been observed on sinter deposits around the world and are usually microbial in origin, at El Tatio they sometimes feature still living bacteria. In the case of El Tatio, these biogenic textures are particularly well preserved in the sinter deposited by water flowing away from springs. Chloroflexus is a thermophilic filamentous green bacterium found in hot waters at Yellowstone; filamentous structures within geyser cones at El Tatio may have been formed by this bacterium. In splash cones Synechococcus-like microbes are instead responsible for the structures, which resemble those of hot springs. The presence of microorganisms in sinter has been implicated in their tolerance to UV radiation, as sinter absorbs much of this incoming harmful radiation. Some microstructures found on the Home Plate landform on Mars are similar to these biogenic structures at El Tatio, but do not necessarily imply that the microstructures on Mars are biogenic. Diatoms are also found in El Tatio waters, including Synedra species, which are often found attached to filamentous substrates, and algae are found in the waters. Among bacteria identified in the somewhat colder flowing waters are bacteroidetes and proteobacteria, with Thermus species in the hot waters. Various archaeans have been cultured from El Tatio waters, with hot springs producing crenarchaea, desulfurococcales and methanobacteriales. One species, Methanogenium tatii, has been discovered at El Tatio, and is a methanogen recovered from a warm pool. The species name is derived from the geothermal field and other methanogens may be active in El Tatio.  Macroorganisms  In the upper geyser basin, vegetation has been observed to grow within thermal areas, like a thermal marsh. Animal species found at El Tatio include the snail Heleobia and frog Rhinella spinulosa. The larvae of this frog at El Tatio live in water with approximately constant temperatures of and show atypical development patterns than frogs of the same species that developed in places with more variable water temperatures.  Geological history  During the Pliocene‚ÄìQuaternary the Western Cordillera was subject to extensional tectonics. A related fault system was active and gave rise to the Tucle horst and Tatio graben; it is also linked to Sol de Ma√±ana in Bolivia and controls the position of several vents in El Tatio. Within the Tatio graben, a series of ignimbrites was emplaced. The first was the 10.5‚Äì9.3 million years old Rio Salado ignimbrite, which forms a thick layer; this might imply that the source of this ignimbrite was close to El Tatio. The Rio Salado ignimbrite elsewhere crops out as two flow units, with varying colours, and close to El Tatio it is crystalline and densely welded. It was followed by the 8.3 million years old voluminous Sifon ignimbrite, which reaches a thickness of about in the graben. The Pliocene Puripicar ignimbrite reaches a similar thickness, and it was later downwarped by faulting. This strong ignimbrite volcanism is associated with activity of the Altiplano‚ÄìPuna volcanic complex, which has produced dacite dominated large volume ignimbrites and sizable calderas, starting from the middle Miocene. Among these, Cerro Guacha, La Pacana, Pastos Grandes and Vilama produced supereruptions. The Tatio ignimbrite was emplaced less than one million years ago, while the Tucle volcanics are dated to 800,000 ¬± 100,000 years ago. The ignimbrite reaches a volume of and crops out over a surface area of . The Tatio ignimbrite contains rhyolitic pumice and crystals, while the Tucle volcanics are andesitic and include both lava and tuffs. The El Tatio ignimbrite ponded in the Tatio graben and may have originated at the Tocorpuri rhyolite dome, which is less than one million years old, in a vent now buried beneath the El Tatio volcanic group, or at the Laguna Colorada caldera. The El Tatio volcanic group has likewise been dated to be less than one million years old, and its lavas overlie the older formations. Volcan Tatio erupted mafic lavas probably during the Holocene; later this volcano was reinterpreted to be of Pleistocene age. Petrological data suggest that over time the erupted lavas of the El Tatio volcanic group have become more mafic, with older products being andesitic and later ones basaltic-andesitic. There is no recorded historical volcanism in the El Tatio area. Based on the rates of sinter precipitation and the thickness of the sinter deposits, it has been estimated that the sinters at El Tatio started to form between 4,000 and 1,500 years ago; these age estimates were not based on direct dating of the deposits, however. Later, radiocarbon dating of the sinter deposits found that their deposition began after the end of the last ice age, an observation endorsed by the presence of glacial deposits beneath the sinter. Secular variations in the deposition rate have been found, with an increase noted in the last 2,000 years.  Human exploitation  Technical equipment at El Tatio Geothermal power is the energy that comes from the internal heat of the Earth, and where the heat flow from the interior of the globe is sufficiently high it can be used both for heating purposes and for the generation of electrical power. , about 10.9 gigawatt geothermal energy are produced on Earth, not all of this production is linked to active volcanism. In the case of Chile however various legal and economic hurdles have so far prevented substantial development of geothermal energy in the country. The earliest references to geothermal power at El Tatio go back to the beginning of the 20th century, when a private society \\"Comunidad de El Tatio\\" was formed and employed Italian engineers from Larderello, which in 1921 and 1922 probed the field. Technical and economic problems prevented this first effort from further progress. Feasibility studies in northern Chile identified El Tatio as a potential site for geothermal power generation, with large scale prospecting taking place in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1973 and 1974, wells were drilled and it was estimated that if the geothermal resources were fully exploited, about electric power could be produced. Also in 1974 a desalination facility was built at El Tatio and can still be seen there today; a thermal desalination process was developed at El Tatio, which could be used both for creating fresh water and brine that could be reprocessed for valuable minerals. Drilling substantially altered the behaviour of the hot springs; already in November 1995, reports indicated that a number of geysers had disappeared or become hot springs and fumaroles. El Tatio is remote and this along with economic difficulties eventually led to the abandonment of the efforts at power generation; a bidding process for exploration rights in 1978 to attract private companies to El Tatio was interrupted by government changes. More recently in the 2000s several companies expressed interest at restarting geothermal power projects at El Tatio. A dispute over gas supplies for Northern Chile from Argentina in 2005 helped push the project forward, and after an environmental impact review in 2007 the Chilean government in 2008 granted a concession to develop geothermal resources in the field, with the expected yield being about 100, 60 or 40 megawatt. The first drilling permits were issued for the Quebrada de Zoquete area away from the main field. It progressed until 2009, when an incident at the site along with environmental issues caused it to stall again.  Controversy  Steam venting created by the geothermal well blowout On 8 September 2009, a well that was being bored in El Tatio blew out, generating a high steam fountain that was not plugged until 4 October. The operator of the geothermal project restricted access to the blow-out vent and stated through the technical manager of the El Tatio geothermal project that the blowout was neither a threat to the springs nor to tourists visiting El Tatio, and the Empresa Nacional de Geotermia company that operates it denied any responsibility for the incident. The project had earlier been opposed by the local Atacameno population, owing to concerns about environmental damage. Before the incident, an issue of the English-language newspaper The Economist had called attention to the adverse consequences of geothermal power extraction; the incident triggered a major controversy about geothermal power, with ramifications beyond Chile. The controversy gained international attention and involved public demonstrations against the project and the march of two women to the capital Santiago to defend the geothermal field. The environmental authorities of Antofagasta subsequently suspended the El Tatio geothermal project, and the Geot√©rmica del Norte company responsible for the project received strong criticism and was targeted by legal action. Both the Ministers of Mining and Energy cautioned against stigmatizing geothermal energy, however, and some local authorities disagreed with the rejection. The director of the National Geology and Mining Service (SERNAGEOMIN) stated that the company had no plans to handle such a situation. The Geot√©rmica del Norte company was fined 100 UTM for violating mitigation plans, a fine upheld in 2011 by the Court of Appeals in Santiago. Industry-community disputes have occurred before in northern Chile, typically tied to conflicts about the use of water, which was in large part privatized during the Pinochet era; during the Tatio controversy power generation also gained prominence among the disputed issues. An important factor in the Tatio controversy is the role of the tourism industry, which viewed the geothermal project as a threat; this kind of industry-industry conflict was unusual. Geothermal projects in New Zealand and the United States have resulted in the extinction of geysers, and the tourism industry of the region had been opposed to the project for a while. While the incident ultimately did not result in lasting changes to the El Tatio geysers, the widespread media attention did create adverse publicity and social opposition against geothermal energy in Chile.  Tourism  El Tatio is a tourism destination, with substantial numbers of travelers both from Chile and other countries. This tourism is an important economic resource for the region, and the site is administered by the local Atacameno population. In 2009, there were more than 400 daily visitors of the geysers, about 90 percent of all tourism of San Pedro de Atacama from where El Tatio can be reached. Aside from viewing the geysers, bathing in the hot water and watching the natural scenery are other activities possible at El Tatio. Environmental impacts such as pollution and vandalism of geothermal landforms has been documented. Safety warning sign El Tatio displays some typical hazards of geothermal areas. Exposure to the hot gases and water can result in burn injuries, and both sudden eruptions of geysers and fountains and fragile ground above vents and above boiling water, concealed beneath thin covers of solid ground, increase the risk to unwary travelers. The site lies at high altitude, frequently leading to altitude sickness, and the cold dry climate creates further danger. The Chilean government recommends that tourists take warm clothing, sunscreen and mineral water. In 2010, the El Tatio area was declared to be a protected area, with a surface area of . It was not clear at that time what the exact status would be, with the regional Secretary of Agriculture proposing that it should become a national park.

She was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the grunion. Her keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut on 1 March 1941. She was launched on 22 December 1941, (sponsored by Mrs. Stanford C. Hooper, wife of Rear Admiral Hooper), and commissioned on 11 April 1942 with Lieutenant Commander Mannert L. Abele, USNA class of 1926 in command. After shakedown out of New London, the Grunion sailed for the Pacific on 24 May. A week later, as she transited the Caribbean Sea for Panama, she rescued 16 survivors of the USAT Jack, which had been torpedoed by the , and conducted a fruitless search for 13 other survivors presumed to be in the vicinity. Arriving at Coco Solo on 3 June, the Grunion landed the survivors and continued on to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 20 June. Departing Hawaii on 30 June after ten days of intensive training, the Grunion touched Midway Island before heading toward the Aleutian Islands for her first war patrol. Her first report, made as she patrolled north of Kiska Island, stated she had been attacked by a Japanese destroyer and had fired Mark 14 torpedoes at her with inconclusive results. She operated off Kiska throughout July and sank two Japanese sub-chasers (CH-25 and CH-27) and possibly damaged a third (CH-26) as she waited for enemy shipping. On 30 July, the submarine reported intensive antisubmarine activity and was ordered back to Dutch Harbor. The Grunion was never heard from again. Air searches off Kiska were fruitless, and on 5 October the Grunion was reported overdue from patrol and assumed lost with all hands. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 November 1942. Captured Japanese records show no antisubmarine attacks in the Kiska area, and the fate of Grunion remained a mystery for 65 years, until the discovery in the Bering Sea in August 2007 of a wreck believed to be her. In October 2008, the U.S. Navy verified that the wreck is the Grunion.According to Lieutenant Commander Meiji Tagami, his I-25 submarine sank an American submarine in the Aleutians, and it must have been Grunion. The Grunion received one battle star for her World War II service.  The search for the Grunion  In 1998 Lieut. Col. Richard Lane purchased for $1 a wiring diagram from a Japanese cargo ship, the Kano Maru, which had been active during World War II.Peter F. Stevens. Fatal Dive: Solving the World War II Mystery of the USS Grunion, Regnery History, 2012 Hoping to authenticate the document, Lane posted it on a Japanese naval historical website, asking if anyone could help. He was contacted by Yutaka Iwasaki, a Japanese naval historian, who not only authenticated it, but suggested he knew what happened to the Grunion. Lane contacted ComSubPac, and their public affairs officer, Darrel Ames, posted the information on ComSubPac's Grunion Web site. When the Grunion disappeared in 1942, her captain, Lieutenant Commander Abele, left behind three sons ‚Äî Bruce, Brad, and John. For nearly 65 years, they had been searching for information about the loss of their father's boat. When the Abele brothers encountered the post, they contacted Yutaka Iwasaki. He sent them a translation of an article written by the officer who had commanded the merchant ship Kano Maru. The article described an encounter with a submarine near Kiska Island in the Aleutians about the time the Grunion was reported missing. Several years later, John Abele, cofounder of Boston Scientific, met Dr. Robert Ballard, famous for discovering the wreck of the RMS Titanic. Ballard gave him advice on how to locate a shipwreck, and Abele decided to fund an expedition to find the lost submarine Grunion. In 2006, Williamson Associates, using side-scan sonar, located a promising target almost at the exact location indicated by the commander of the Kano Maru. The sunken object had many characteristics typical of a submarine. In 2007, using a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV), DSSI/Oceaneering, returned to the site and took video recordings of the imploded remains of a submarine, which had markings in English, and propeller guards and limber holes identical to those of the Grunion. The following year, the U.S. Navy confirmed that the find was the Grunion. Although it is not absolutely certain, the evidence strongly suggests that the Grunion was lost as a result of multiple torpedo failures during her encounter with the Kano Maru. Her first torpedo ran low, but despite its magnetic pistol it failed to detonate. Two more bounced harmlessly off the Kano Maru without exploding. However, the remaining torpedo missed its target and circled back, striking the periscope supports on the submerged submarine without exploding. The damage the torpedo inflicted, combined with a jammed rear dive plane, triggered a sequence of events that caused the loss of depth control. The Grunion lunged below her maximum operational depth, and at about 1000 feet would have imploded. What remained of the ship struck the seabed, breaking off about 50 feet of her bow. The wreckage then slid two- thirds of a mile down the side of an extinct volcano, coming to rest on a notch in the underwater mountain. In 2019, the missing bow section was located a quarter mile from the rest of the submarine on a slope of an underwater volcano.

He was described as so developmentally disabled that he was unable to speak, clothe himself, or be able to express whether he was hungry or full. He was created crown prince in 387 and ascended the throne in 397. Because of his disability, the actual power was controlled by his uncle, Sima Daozi, Prince of Kuaiji. During his reign, regents and warlords dominated the Jin regime. Revolts by various governors also ravaged the land. From 398 to 403, there were constant revolts and civil war campaigns. In 403, the Jin regime was usurped by the warlord Huan Xuan, and while Emperor An was restored in 404, the Jin Dynasty was nearing its end. With the warlord Liu Yu as the actual power, Jin destroyed Southern Yan and Later Qin, greatly expanding its territory. However, with Liu Yu up in the north, the renegade governor of Guang Province (Âª£Â∑û, modern Guangdong and Guangxi), Lu Xun, rebelled and threatened the capital city Jiankang, before Liu Yu returned and crushed the revolt. In 419, Emperor An was strangled under the order of Liu Yu and replaced with his brother Emperor Gong, who would be the last emperor of the dynasty, before Liu Yu would take the throne and establish the Liu Song Dynasty.  Early life  Sima Dezong was the oldest son of Emperor Xiaowu, born of his concubine Consort Chen Guin√º in 382. It is not known when Sima Dezong's developmental disability became known, but it was likely very early in his childhood, for the degree of his disability, according to historians, was great. When he was just eight years old, in 390, his mother died. Even though he had a younger brother, Sima Dewen, born of Consort Chen as well (in 385), who was described to be intelligent and careful, and who learned to take care of him throughout the years, for reasons unknown, Emperor Xiaowu appeared to have never seriously considered making Sima Dewen his heir, and in 387, Sima Dezong was created crown prince. In 395, he was set up in his own residence, the eastern palace, as was customary for crown princes. In 396, he married the daughter of the official Wang Xianzhi, Wang Shen'ai, as his crown princess. In 397, Emperor Xiaowu was killed by his concubine Honoured Lady Zhang, after offending her. However, with the emperor's only brother Sima Daozi, Prince of Kuaiji, being incompetent and Crown Prince Dezong being developmentally disabled, no investigation into Emperor Xiaowu's death was conducted. Crown Prince Dezong succeeded to the throne as Emperor An, and Sima Daozi became regent.  Under Sima Daozi's regency  Sima Daozi, as regent, was constantly drunk and greatly trusted Wang Guobao () and Wang Xu () because of their flattery, and his regency quickly developed a reputation for being corrupt and incompetent. The provincial governor Wang Gong (), whom Emperor Xiaowu entrusted with the armies of the northeastern part of the empire, considered starting a rebellion to overthrow Wang Guobao and Wang Xu. In 397, Wang Guobao and Wang Xu suggested to Sima Daozi that the armies that Wang Gong and another provincial governor, Yin Zhongkan (), were in charge of be reduced; Wang Gong and Yin, who was in command of the western provinces, in response, mobilized their forces and declared that Wang Guobao and Wang Xu should be executed. Sima Daozi, in fear, forced Wang Guobao to commit suicide and executed Wang Xu. Wang Gong and Yin then retreated. From this point on, Sima Daozi trusted no one but his teenage heir apparent, Sima Yuanxian, and entrusted the capital guards to Sima Yuanxian. He also gave military commands to his distant relatives Sima Shangzhi () the Prince of Qiao and Sima Shangzhi's brother Sima Xiuzhi, as well as Wang Yu (), in 398. The giving of a military command to Wang Yu oddly drew a reaction from Wang Gong and Yin‚Äîas Wang Yu's command included four commanderies originally under the command of Yu Kai (), who became angry and managed to persuade Wang Gong and Yin that Sima Daozi's intention was to act against them as well. They therefore rose again, but Sima Daozi was able to persuade Wang Gong's general Liu Laozhi (), who was in command of the elite Beifu Forces (), to suddenly turn against Wang Gong, capturing and executing him. Yin, hearing of Wang Gong's death, was in fear but considered proceeding anyway‚Äîand Sima Daozi, under suggestion by Huan Xuan's cousin Huan Xiu (), managed to cause dissension between Yin and his generals Huan Xuan and Yang Quanqi () by offering Huan and Yang key posts; although Huan and Yang nominally remained Yin's allies, Yin was forced to withdraw his troops, and from that point on no longer posed a major threat, as his domain had now been divided into three, with Huan and Yang each given a third. In late 398, the magician Sun Tai (), a friend of Sima Yuanxian's, who had gathered great following due to his magic, was exposed as planning a plot to take over the central government, and Sima Daozi ordered Sima Yuanxian to trap Sun Tai and execute him. Sun Tai's nephew Sun En fled to Zhoushan Island and planned revenge. In summer 399, Sima Yuanxian, wanting even greater power, took an opportunity when his father was very drunk to have Emperor An issue an edict transferring Sima Daozi's authorities to Sima Yuanxian. When Sima Daozi awoke from his stupor, he was enraged, but after that point his power became extremely limited, even though he nominally remained regent.  Under Sima Yuanxian's regency  Sima Yuanxian's regency was one in which he became surrounded by flatterers, and he began to have unrealistic ambitions of ending the threat that various provincial warlords posed to his rule. He greatly trusted the strategist Zhang Fashun (), and also introduced many trusted associates into the administration. While he appeared to have some abilities, he also was, according to traditional historians, wasting the government's money in luxury and not paying attention to the burdens of the people. Late in 399, Sun En, seeing how the only province remaining under Jin imperial government's actual control‚ÄîYang Province (ÊèöÂ∑û, modern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) -- had been mismanaged by Sima Yuanxian, launched a major attack from Zhoushan Island, briefly taking over nearly all of Yang Province and advancing on the capital Jiankang (modern Nanjing, Jiangsu). Sun's rebellion was soon put down by Liu Laozhi, and Sun fled back to Zhoushan (but would remain a menace for several years), but Yang Province had been laid to waste. Despite this, Sima Yuanxian grew increasingly extravagant and arrogant. In late 401, apprehensive of the growing power of Huan Xuan (who had in late 399 defeated and killed Yin Zhongkan and Yang Quanqi, seizing their domains and now controlled more than two thirds of Jin territory), Sima Yuanxian declared Huan a renegade and ordered an attack against Huan. However, he was largely dependent on Liu Laozhi's army, and Liu distrusted Sima Yuanxian. Meanwhile, Huan advanced east toward the capital and, after he made overtures to Liu, Liu turned against Sima Yuanxian. Jiankang fell to Huan, and Sima Yuanxian was captured and executed, along with all of his major associates. Huan also had Sima Daozi exiled and killed and became in full control of the empire. Not trusting of the treacherous Liu, Huan stripped him of his military command, and Liu tried to rebel again‚Äîbut his own army officers were tired of repeated rebellions and deserted him, and he committed suicide.  Takeover and usurpation by Huan Xuan  Huan Xuan initially tried to institute reforms of the imperial government, and the populace and governmental officials were pleased with changes he introduced, and he also tried to make peace with Sun En's brother-in-law Lu Xun (), who replaced Sun En after Sun En committed suicide after a battlefield loss in 402, by offering Lu a commandery governorship. However, Huan Xuan soon took to living luxuriously and modifying laws at whim, and it was said that supplies to the imperial household were so reduced that even Emperor An almost suffered from hunger and cold. In fall 403, Huan Xuan had Emperor An create him the Prince of Chu and give him the nine bestowments‚Äîboth signs of an impending usurpation. In winter 403, Huan Xuan had Emperor An issue an edict (an edict that, according to traditional historians, Huan Xuan had Sima Bao () the Prince of Linchuan force Emperor An to personally write, although this account appears doubtful, as Emperor An's handicap makes it unlikely that he could personally write this edict) giving the throne to Huan Xuan. Huan then took the throne as emperor of a new Chu state. He created Emperor An as the Prince of Pinggu, but kept the emperor and his brother Sima Dewen the Prince of Langya (now reduced in rank to Duke of Shiyang) under virtual house arrest. In spring 404, Huan Xuan's general Liu Yu, seeing that Huan Xuan lacked actual talent or popular support, led an uprising of a coalition of generals against him, starting the uprising at Jingkou (‰∫¨Âè£, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) and reaching Jiankang within a few days. Huan Xuan fled, but took Emperor An and Sima Dewen with him, back to his old power base Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµ, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). Liu Yu declared the restoration of Jin, and by summer 404, forces under his confederates Liu Yi (), He Wuji (), and his brother Liu Daogui () had reached the vicinity of Jiangling and defeated Huan Xuan's troops. Huan Xuan tried to flee again, but was killed by forces of the general Mao Qu (). Emperor An was declared to be restored at Jiangling by the officials Wang Kangchan () and Wang Tengzhi (). However, Huan Xuan's nephew Huan Zhen () soon surprised Wang Kangchan and Wang Tengzhi and captured Jiangling, taking Emperor An hostage, although ostensibly honoring him as the emperor. In spring 405, Jiangling fell to Liu Yi's forces, and Huan Zhen fled. Emperor An was welcomed back to Jiankang, but at this point on, Liu Yu was largely in control of the situation.  Under Liu Yu's regency = Early years  Liu Yu, although he had ambitions to be emperor, learned from Huan Xuan's failures that he could not act too quickly, but must establish his authority through further victories first, particularly since because he led a coalition of generals and officials with different agendas in his victory over Huan. He therefore proceeded cautiously, initially sharing power with He Wuji and Liu Yi, among others. For the next few years, he also made several offers to resign his posts, judging correctly that the imperial officials would not dare to accept them, to further establish the image that he was indispensable. In spring 405, Mao Qu's soldiers, from Yi Province (modern Sichuan and Chongqing), unhappy that Mao sent them on long- distance campaigns initially against Huan Xuan and then against Huan Zhen, rebelled, supporting the military officer Qiao Zong as their leader. They defeated and killed Mao and captured Chengdu (ÊàêÈÉΩ, in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), and Qiao Zong established his independent Western Shu state there. Also in 405, Lu Xun, who had in 404 marched south and captured Panyu (Áï™Á¶∫, in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong) during the wars relating to Huan Xuan, offered peace to the imperial government by paying a tribute. Liu Yu, believing that he had no abilities to defeat Lu by this point, made Lu the governor of Guang Province (Âª£Â∑û, modern Guangdong and Guangxi) and Lu's brother-in-law and lieutenant Xu Daofu () the governor of Shixing Principality (ÂßãËàà, roughly modern Shaoguan, Guangdong). In 407, Liu Yu commissioned his friend Liu Jingxuan (ÂäâÊï¨ÂÆ£, Liu Laozhi's son) to launch a major attack on Qiao Zong's Western Shu, but in 408, Liu Jingxuan's forces became stalled against the Western Shu general Qiao Daofu () and was forced to retreat when food supplies ran out.  Campaigns against Southern Yan and Lu Xun  In 409, the Southern Yan emperor Murong Chao began a campaign of attacking and pillaging the Jin northern borders, intending to capture men and women to be trained as musicians. In response, Liu Yu decided to launch a campaign to destroy Southern Yan, over the objections of most imperial officials, but was supported by one of Liu Yu's initial allies in starting the uprising against Huan Xuan, Meng Chang (). While Liu Yu was quickly able to defeat Southern Yan main forces in late 409 and put the Southern Yan capital Guanggu (Âª£Âõ∫, in modern Qingzhou, Shandong) under siege, Guanggu did not fall quickly. While Liu Yu was sieging Guanggu, Xu Daofu persuaded a reluctant Lu Xun (who was afraid of a confrontation with Liu Yu) to attack north, reasoning that eventually when Liu Yu was ready, Liu Yu would attack first, and that with Liu Yu sieging Guanggu, they could capture the rest of the empire together. In spring 410, Liu Yu, captured Guanggu, ending Southern Yan, and considered further readying a campaign against Later Qin, was informed that Lu and Xu were attacking north, and therefore quickly returned south toward Jiankang. Meanwhile, He Wuji led a fleet against Xu at Yuzhang (Ë±´Á´†, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), but was defeated and killed by Xu. A second force commanded by Liu Yi was also defeated by Xu and Lu. However, Liu Yi's captured soldiers informed Lu that Liu Yu was on his way back to Jiankang, and Lu, intimidated, considered ending his campaign, but continued to Jiankang at Xu's insistence. A number of imperial officials, including Meng, suggested that Emperor An be taken across the Yangtze River to evade Lu's forces, but Liu Yu refused, choosing to defend Jiankang. Once at Jiankang, Lu refused several strategies that Xu offered that were risky but offered chances of success, instead trying to intimidate Liu Yu's forces into collapsing, which he could not do. Soon he ran out of food supplies and withdrew to Xunyang (Â∞ãÈôΩ, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi). Liu Yu gave chase, but also ordered his generals Sun Chu () and Shen Tianzi () to take a fleet by sea to attack Panyu, fully confident that he can defeat Lu and make it impossible for Lu to then retreat to his home base. Meanwhile, Xu attacked Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern Hubei and Hunan), but was defeated by Liu Yu's brother Liu Daogui (), and rejoined Lu, preparing for a confrontation with Liu Yu. Around the new year 411, they engaged Liu Yu at Dalei (Â§ßÈõ∑, in modern Anqing, Anhui), but Liu Yu destroyed their fleet with fire. Lu and Xu fled toward Panyu, which had however been captured by Sun at this point. Lu put Panyu under siege, but Shen, who was then trying to capture other commanderies, returned to Panyu and defeated Lu along with Sun. Lu fled toward Jiao Province (‰∫§Â∑û, modern northern Vietnam). The governor of Jiao Province, Du Huidu (), defeated Lu, and Lu killed his wife and concubines, and then committed suicide by jumping into a river.  Campaigns against Western Shu and Later Qin  With the state having been stabilized after Lu Xun's destruction, Liu Yu again turned his attention outward, hoping to use military victories to propel himself into sufficiently high public standing that he can take the throne for himself. At the same time, however, he began to remove members of his coalition who stood or might stand in his way. In 412, believing that Liu Yi, then governor of Jing Province, was about to act against him along with Liu Yi's cousin Liu Fan () the governor of Yan Province (ÂÖóÂ∑û, then modern central Jiangsu), he arrested Liu Fan and his friend Xie Hun (), and then made a surprise attack against Liu Yi, defeating Liu Yi's forces easily. Liu Yi was killed in flight. In 413, Liu Yu also surprised and killed his assistant, the general Zhuge Zhangmin (), whom he suspected of considering to act against him when he was away from Jiankang attacking Liu Yi. Meanwhile, in late 412, Liu Yu commissioned the general Zhu Lingshi () to attack Qiao Zong's Western Shu, secretly instructing him to take the long route to Qiao Zong's capital Chengdu by Min River (), rather than the short route by Fu River (). Zhu's forces were able to surprise Qiao Zong's main general Qiao Daofu and Qiao Zong himself, capturing Chengdu in 413 and annexing Western Shu back into Jin. In 414, Liu Yu began to suspect Liu Yi's replacement as the governor of Jing Province, Sima Xiuzhi (), who was a member of the imperial clan and whose son Sima Wensi () had been created the Prince of Qiao and had gathered many adventurers around him. In spring 414, Liu Yu had Sima Wensi's confederates arrested and executed, while delivering Sima Wensi to Sima Xiuzhi, intending for Sima Xiuzhi to show submission by executing Sima Wensi himself. Instead, Sima Xiuzhi only requested that Sima Wensi's princely title be stripped. In spring 415, Liu Yu arrested another son of Sima Xiuzhi, Sima Wenbao (), and Sima Xiuzhi's nephew Sima Wenzu (), ordering the two to commit suicide, and then launched an attack on Sima Xiuzhi, who was joined by Lu Zongzhi () the governor of Yong Province (ÈõçÂ∑û, then modern northwestern Hubei). Initially, Sima Xiuzhi and Lu Zongzhi enjoyed some successes, defeating Liu Yu's son-in-law Xu Kuizhi (), but after Liu Yu himself arrived, he defeated Sima Xiuzhi's forces, capturing Jiangling and forcing Sima Xiuzhi and Lu Zongzhi to flee to Later Qin. Liu Yu now no longer had significant opposition in Jin. In 416, Liu Yu launched a major attack against Later Qin, in light of the recent death of the Later Qin emperor Yao Xing, entrusting the capital to his assistant Liu Muzhi (), with his teenage heir apparent Liu Yifu being nominally in charge. In winter 416, the important city Luoyang fell to Liu Yu's general Tan Daoji (). In light of Luoyang's fall, Liu Yu had Emperor An create him Duke of Song and bestow him the nine bestowments, showing his intentions to take the throne eventually, although he declined both honors at that point. In spring 417, Tan Daoji and another general, Shen Linzi (), engaged in a major campaign with Later Qin's most prominent general, Yao Shao () the Duke of Lu, the uncle of the emperor Yao Hong. After a month of battles, Yao Shao was defeated, and he died in anger. With Yao Shao dead, the other Later Qin generals could not resist Jin forces. Liu Yu's fleet, commanded by Wang Zhen'e (ÁéãÈéÆÊÉ°, Wang Meng's grandson), advanced quickly, while Yao Hong tried to first destroy Liu Yu's flank forces, commanded by Shen Linzi's brother Shen Tianzi. Despite Yao Hong's large advantage in numbers, Shen Tianzi crushed him, forcing him to flee back to his capital Chang'an. Wang Zhen'e's fleet then arrived and defeated Later Qin's final resistance, entering Chang'an. Yao Hong surrendered, and Liu Yu had him delivered to Jiankang and executed, ending Later Qin.  Emperor An's death  With Later Qin destroyed, there was an expectation that Liu Yu would next advance northwest and either destroy or force the subjugation of the several states in the northwest still -- Xia, Western Qin, Northern Liang, and Western Liang. Indeed, at this point, Western Qin's prince Qifu Chipan, Northern Liang's prince Juqu Mengxun, and Western Liang's prince Li Gao were all sufficiently intimidated that they nominally submitted to Jin's authority. However, Liu Muzhi then died at this time, and Liu Yu, intending on taking the throne, decided to return to Jiankang himself, leaving his 11-year-old son Liu Yizhen () and the generals Wang Zhen'e, Shen Tianzi, Mao Dezu (), and the official Wang Xiu () in charge of Chang'an. With Liu Yu having left Chang'an, Xia's emperor Helian Bobo was intent on taking Chang'an himself. He had his sons Helian Gui () and Helian Chang, along with his general Wang Maide () make a three-pronged advance toward Chang'an while cutting off the supply route between Luoyang and Chang'an. Meanwhile, with Wang Zhen'e and Shen Tianzi being previously envious of each other, Shen Tianzi suspected Wang Zhen'e of being ready to rebel, and so killed him. Wang Xiu then executed Shen Tianzi, but then Liu Yizhen believed the accusations that Wang Zhen'e was in fact about to rebel and that Wang Xiu was ready to as well, and so executed Wang Xiu. Once Wang Xiu was executed, Liu Yizhen himself was without supervision, and he, in fear of Xia forces, withdrew all of his forces inside Chang'an, and Xia forces then sieged the city. Liu Yu, hearing this, sent Zhu Lingshi to replace Liu Yizhen and ordered Liu Yizhen to withdraw. Liu Yizhen's forces, however, having pillaged Chang'an, could not withdraw quickly, and they were crushed by Xia forces at Qingni (ÈùíÊ≥•, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), with nearly the entire army killed or captured. Liu Yizhen barely escaped with his life, and the Chang'an region became Xia possession, although Jin retained the Luoyang region. Meanwhile, Liu Yu, having accepted the Duke of Song title and the nine bestowments in summer 418, had Emperor An create him the Prince of Song, but then publicly declined it. Meanwhile, he became convinced of the truth of a prophecy that stated, \\"There will be two more emperors after Changming.\\" (Changming, which meant \\"dawn,\\" was the courtesy name of Emperor An's father Emperor Xiaowu.) He therefore became resolved to kill Emperor An, and he tried several times to have Emperor An's servants poison him, but because Emperor An's brother Sima Dewen continuously attended to him, the servants had no chance to poison him. However, around the new year 419, Sima Dewen was himself ill and had to be at his house.

As Sonic the Hedgehog, the player embarks on a journey to save the Flickies, birds enslaved by Doctor Robotnik. The player must guide Sonic through a series of themed levels to collect Flickies and defeat Robotnik. Though it retains game mechanics from prior Sonic games, Sonic 3D Blast is differentiated by its isometric perspective, with pre-rendered 3D models converted into sprites. The concept for Sonic 3D Blast originated during the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994). Most of the programming was outsourced to the British studio Traveller's Tales, as the Japanese Sonic Team staff was preoccupied with Nights into Dreams (1996). Development lasted eight months, and the team drew inspiration from Donkey Kong Country (1994) and Sonic Labyrinth (1995). Sonic 3D Blast was developed alongside the Saturn game Sonic X-treme. When X-treme was canceled, Sega commissioned a port of 3D Blast featuring improved graphics for the Saturn. Both versions were published by Sega in November 1996, with a Windows port released the following year. Sonic 3D Blast was the final Sonic game for the Genesis, and has been rereleased through Sonic compilations and digital distribution platforms. Though commercially successful, it received mixed reviews. Criticism was directed at its isometric gameplay, controls, and pace, although the visuals and soundtrack were praised. Journalists retrospectively consider the game one of the series' worst. An unofficial director's cut version, featuring adjusted gameplay elements and improved controls, was released by the Genesis version's lead programmer, Jon Burton, in 2017. Gameplay isometric perspective. Sonic 3D Blast is a platform game presented from an isometric perspective. Players control Sonic the Hedgehog, whose goal is to save the Flickies, collect the seven Chaos Emeralds, and defeat Doctor Robotnik and his robot army. Sonic retains most of his abilities from prior games: he can jump and spin in mid-air to defeat robots or hop on platforms, perform a spin-dash on the ground to gain speed, and collects rings as a form of health. Sonic can also collect power-ups, such as elemental shields, speed shoes, or invincibility, by breaking television monitors containing them. The game is split into several levels called zones. Every zone has three acts: two standard levels, where the player must collect Flickies by defeating robots in order to proceed; and a boss fight against Robotnik, without any Flicky-collecting involved. In normal levels, once the player collects all five Flickies from each section of an act, Sonic is either further advanced into the act, or taken to the next act. If Sonic and the following Flickies are hit by an obstacle or enemy, the Flickies and the rings Sonic collected will scatter. Each individual Flicky's color determines its behavior: blue, pink and orange Flickies make an effort to find Sonic, while green and red Flickies wander off at random; the latter even jumping about, making them harder to re-collect. Sonic starts the game with four lives; if he is hit with no Flickies or rings in his possession, he will lose a life. Losing all lives results in a game over. Lives can be replenished by collecting a 1-up, and continues are obtained by collecting ten Sonic-shaped medals. As with previous games, Sonic 3D Blast includes \\"special stages\\", in which the player collects Chaos Emeralds. Obtaining all seven Emeralds allows the player to play the final boss battle and discover the true ending of the game. To access these stages, the player must find one of Sonic's friends (either Tails or Knuckles the Echidna) hidden within a level, and stand next to them with at least 50 rings collected. Doing so allows the player to exchange the rings in order for the chance to play the game's special stage. During special stages, the camera shifts to behind Sonic as he runs down a preset path and must collect rings while avoiding obstacles that, when run into, make him lose rings. A certain number of rings need to be obtained at certain checkpoints to continue through the stage, and ultimately be able to make it to the end in order to receive a Chaos Emerald. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds also allows the \\"Final Fight\\" level to be played, consisting of a final boss fight and the good ending of the game. Plot Doctor Robotnik discovers mysterious birds called Flickies that live on an island in an alternate dimension. He learns that they can travel anywhere using large rings, so he decides to exploit them by turning them into robots to help him search for the Chaos Emeralds. Sonic arrives at the island only to discover the presence of Robotnik, and he is tasked with saving the Flickies and defeating his nemesis. Sonic travels through the island, saving the Flickies and clashing with Robotnik in his various machines. If the player collects all the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic proceeds into a black void, where he engages in a final battle with Robotnik, who pilots a large robot. Sonic manages to destroy the robot's weapons and defeats Robotnik, freeing the Flickies. If the player fails to collect the Emeralds, Robotnik escapes in their possession. Development Sonic 3D Blast was the final Sonic the Hedgehog game produced for the Sega Genesis, and was developed as a swan song for the system. Sega had discontinued official support for the Genesis in 1995, but intended to produce the game for the 16-bit console because games typically sell for one to two years after their platforms' discontinuation. The game's basic concept was conceived by members of Sonic Team during the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), but most of the programming was done by the British studio Traveller's Tales because Sonic Team was developing Nights into Dreams (1996) at the time. According to founder Jon Burton, Traveller's Tales had just finished developing a Toy Story game and wanted to start developing games for 32-bit systems such as the Saturn and PlayStation. Sega, impressed with their work on Toy Story and Mickey Mania, approached them with 3D Blast; as Sonic was extremely popular at the time, the concept \\"got their attention\\". In retrospect, Burton stated that he believed the game was commissioned because Sonic X-treme, in development for the Saturn at the time, was struggling, and Sega wanted to bring Sonic into the 3D era of gaming. The game was developed from scratch in eight months, beginning in July 1995. It was originally titled Sonic Spindrift. Burton, who served as lead programmer, implemented an exception handler where, should an error occur, the game would greet the player with a secret level select screen instead of crashing; this was done so the game could easily pass Sega's approval process for publishing games. Burton also gave the game a unique full motion video intro sequence, and used compression methods to make the video fit in the 4MB cartridge and appear higher resolution. The game makes use of some pre-rendered 3D models converted into sprites. The team decided to use 3D instead of 2D because they thought \\"it was time for something new.\\" Inspiration for the isometric viewpoint was drawn from Sonic Labyrinth (1995) and Super Mario RPG (1996). The item collection was influenced by the 1984 Flicky game, and the graphics were inspired by Donkey Kong Country (1994). Sonic Team provided Traveller's Tales with game, level, and character designs. Burton remembered the partnership with Sega fondly, recalling that he greatly enjoyed \\"making a machine do something you haven't seen it do\\". Towards the end of development, Traveller's Tales began to expand its scope, and Burton passed the rest of programming to his employees. Sega also commissioned a version of the game for the Sega Saturn in case Sonic X-treme was canceled. This cancellation did indeed occur, so Sonic 3D Blast was safely released in time for Christmas 1996 in its stead. The game was ported in seven weeks, during development of the Sega Genesis version. While it does feature graphical changes, such as weather effects and higher resolution textures, the game largely plays the same as the original version. It features a higher quality opening video and improved graphics. Sonic Team filled in for development of the special stage in the Saturn version of the game, which includes polygonal graphics as opposed to sprites only. This version is also compatible with the Saturn's analog control pad. The team attempted to rework X-treme into bonus stages in the Saturn version. However, they were unable to properly transfer Sonic's model from X-treme into 3D Blast, so the feature was scrapped. The soundtrack for the Genesis version, which features 24 tracks in total, was primarily composed by Jun Senoue and Tatsuyuki Maeda, with Masaru Setsumaru and Seirou Okamoto composing the final boss and staff roll themes, respectively. The Saturn version's soundtrack was composed and produced by Richard Jacques, and features the song \\"You're My Hero\\" performed by Debbie Morris, which is played during the credits. The musical styles on the soundtrack were described by Sega Saturn Magazine as both traditional Sonic music and \\"hardcore techno\\". Release Sonic 3D Blast was released for the Genesis in North America on November 1996, and in Europe within the same month. The Saturn version was released in North America in fall later that year and in Europe on February 1997. The Genesis version was not physically released in Japan; only the Saturn port was, on October 14, 1999. A port of the Sega Saturn version was released for Microsoft Windows in Europe on September 11, 1997, and worldwide later that year. The game's launch coincided with the release of the similarly-titled Game Gear game Sonic Blast, which also features pre-rendered 3D graphics. The Genesis version of the game is available in several Sonic-themed compilations. These include Sonic Mega Collection for the GameCube; Sonic Mega Collection Plus for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Windows; and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was also digitally rereleased for the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007 and Valve's Steam marketplace in 2010. Reception Sonic 3D Blast received mixed reviews, according to the review aggregator GameRankings. Mike Wallis, an employee of Sega at the time, recalled in an interview that the Genesis version was successful for the company, eventually selling over 700,000 copies. The Saturn version was also a commercial success and was one of the system's better-selling games, according to Wallis. Critics generally disapproved of Sonic 3D Blasts gameplay style, some finding its isometric perspective limiting. GamePros Art Angel found that it made timing jumps and spin dashes to either destroy enemies or land on moving platforms frustrating at first, and that once those techniques are mastered the game suddenly becomes too easy. Crispin Boyer of Electronic Gaming Monthly remarked that \\"The game doesn't hold nearly as many secrets [as earlier Sonic the Hedgehog games], and it gets repetitive after a while.\\" Lucas M. Thomas of IGN lamented that \\"the sense of speed and intense action that Sonic's name was built on is absent here, replaced by, essentially, a looping, lazy fetchquest\\". Austin Shau of GameSpot echoed this concern, calling the gameplay \\"an exercise in tedium\\". Besides the game's goals, Shau and Thomas criticized the controls, particularly in the area of Sonic's overly slow-paced movement and slippery deceleration. Thomas did admit that the game \\"has its moments\\" of quick-footed vigor, but characterized these as few and far between, and Shau summarized that, while not unsalvageable in isolation, the game's elements violently clashed and customers would be \\"spending 800 Wii points for a vat of oil and water\\". Damien McFerran of Nintendo Life stated that its repetition was broken only by its boss battles and special stages, the latter of which Shau wrote off as \\"childishly easy\\". However, Shawn Smith and Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly both found the gameplay formula to be well thought-out, with Smith remarking, \\"I like having to retrieve the animals in each level and the various warps make the levels seem huge.\\" Though he compared the gameplay unfavorably to previous Sonic games, Sega Saturn Magazines Lee Nutter found it had a great deal of fun to offer and praised it as being more challenging than any previous Sonic game. Despite his criticism of the isometric format, Art Angel was pleased with the game's level designs. Reflecting on its complaints years earlier upon the game's inclusion in Sonic Mega Collection Plus, Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com called the game \\"much better than you might be led to believe\\". Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame voiced a similar opinion, feeling it was a \\"nice departure\\" from the style of the side-scrolling Sonic games. Reviewers were more positive about the game's presentation. Art Angel gave it a 4.5 out of 5 for graphics, citing the large sprites, clean animations, and consistent frame rate. Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers all praised the graphics, with Shawn Smith and Dan Hsu in particular deeming it the pinnacle of the Genesis's capabilities in terms of its color palette and sense of 3D. McFerran greatly enjoyed the game's visuals: \\"the CGI visuals are stunning considering the hardware, the animation is excellent and the level design is colourful and varied\\". Thomas praised the game's \\"valiant\\" pre-rendered graphics, especially taking its limited hardware into account. Shau stated that the graphics and sound were the only areas in which the game bore a welcome resemblance to its Genesis predecessors, and particularly appreciated the return of the ring-scattering sound effect and similarly music. Game Revolution praised the rounded, cartoon-like graphics, referring to them as \\"some of the sharpest graphics we have ever seen.\\" Weiss wrote that the visuals, though not an improvement from other games artistically, were well- produced and high-quality. Thomas gave the music a subscore of 7.5/10, the highest of any element of the game, and noted that its themes would be memorable to players. McFerran welcomed the graphical improvements of the Saturn version, and GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann appreciated this version's superior handling of certain animations. Entertainment Weekly, however, noted the game's unusually similar presentation on two platforms with differing expectations, claiming that \\"while 3D Blast is super by 16-bit standards, it falls flat on Sega Saturn, where 32-bit games with far more sophisticated 3-D graphics and gameplay are the norm.\\" Smith and Hsu of Electronic Gaming Monthly agreed that the Saturn version is overly similar to the Genesis version, though Hsu added, \\"that's a compliment to the Genesis, not a rip on the Saturn\\". Hsu and Boyer both also said that the game's controls are considerably improved with the Saturn's analog controller, though Sushi-X found it of little help. The staff of GameSpot saw the PC version as similar to the others, but pointed out some slowdown effects while the camera scrolled, attributing these to its wide color palette. Electronic Gaming Monthly named Sonic 3D Blast a runner-up for Genesis Game of the Year (behind Vectorman 2). In retrospect, the game has been viewed more negatively; some journalists called one of the worst games in the Sonic franchise. USgamer and Complex wrote that the game did not feel like a true Sonic game, the latter exclaiming it was \\"offensive\\" to call it 3D. PC Gamer described it as \\"the first sign that Sonic in 3D was just plain not going to work\\". The game is remembered as a black sheep in the franchise. Legacy Archie Comics published a comic book adaptation of Sonic 3D Blast for a 48-page special in December 1996, written by Mike Gallagher. A loose adaptation of the game also appeared in issues 104 through 106 (May through July 1997) of Sonic the Comic. Senoue re-arranged two of his tracks from the Genesis version for Sonic Adventure (1998), saying he felt they were strong enough to be more widely heard, as the Genesis version was not released in Japan. He also reused an unused theme as the boss theme in Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I. A remixed version of the main Saturn theme appeared in Sonic Generations in 2011. After Sonic 3D Blast, Traveller's Tales and Sonic Team collaborated again on the Saturn racing game Sonic R (1997). Sonic 3D Blast was one of Traveller's Tales earliest games; the studio later became known for their work on video games based on the Lego toy line, through which it would revisit the Sonic franchise as part of the 2015 crossover game Lego Dimensions. In 2017, Burton released an unofficial director's cut patch for Sonic 3D Blast, with improved controls and additions such as a level editor, a password save system, time attack challenges, and the ability to transform into Super Sonic.

Caption: \\"One part of this Oath I know to be false; and another I believe to be untrue. House of Commons, May 20, 1829.\\" The Oath of Supremacy required any person taking public or church office in England to swear allegiance to the monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Failure to do so was to be treated as treasonable. The Oath of Supremacy was originally imposed by King Henry VIII of England through the Act of Supremacy 1534, but repealed by his elder daughter, Queen Mary I of England, and reinstated under Henry's other daughter and Mary's half-sister, Queen Elizabeth I of England, under the Act of Supremacy 1559. The Oath was later extended to include Members of Parliament and people studying at universities. Catholics were first allowed to become members of parliament in 1829, and the requirement to take the oath for Oxford University students was lifted by the Oxford University Act 1854. Text of the Oath as published in 1535 > I (state your name) do utterly testifie and declare in my Conscience, that > the Kings Highnesse is the onely Supreame Governour of this Realme, and all > other his Highnesse Dominions and Countries, as well in all Spirituall or > Ecclesiasticall things or causes, as Temporall: And that no forraine Prince, > Person, Prelate, State or Potentate, hath or ought to have any Jurisdiction, > Power, Superiorities, Preeminence or Authority Ecclesiasticall or Spirituall > within this Realme.

For example, Sir Thomas More opposed the King's separation from the Roman Catholic Church in the English Reformation and refused to accept him as Supreme Head of the Church of England, a title which had been given by parliament through the Act of Supremacy of 1534. He was imprisoned in 1534 for his refusal to take the oath, because the act discredited Papal Authority, and his refusal to accept the annulment of Henry‚Äôs marriage to Catherine of Aragon. In 1535, he was tried for treason, convicted on perjured testimony, and beheaded. Exceptions Under the reigns of Charles II and James II, the Oath of Supremacy was not so widely employed by the Crown. This was largely due to the Catholic sympathies and practices of these monarchs, and the resulting high number of Roman Catholics serving in official positions. Examples of officials who never had to take the Oath include the Catholic Privy Counsellors, Sir Stephen Rice and Justin McCarthy, Viscount Mountcashel. The centrality of the Oath was re- established under the reign of William III and Mary II.

Though these relations had existed in Japan for millennia, they became most apparent to scholars during the Tokugawa (or Edo) period. Historical practices identified by scholars as homosexual include , and . The Japanese term is the Japanese reading of the same characters in Chinese, which literally mean \\"male colors\\". The character (\\"color\\") has the added meaning of \\"sexual pleasure\\" in both China and Japan. This term was widely used to refer to some kind of male to male sex in a pre-modern era of Japan. The term is also used, especially in older works. During the Meiji period nanshoku started to become discouraged due to the rise of sexology within Japan and the process of westernization. Modern terms for homosexuals include , , , or , , / and .  Pre-Meiji Japan  A variety of obscure literary references to same-sex love exist in ancient sources, but many of these are so subtle as to be unreliable; another consideration is that declarations of affection for friends of the same sex were common. Nevertheless, references do exist, and they become more numerous in the Heian period, roughly in the 11th century. For example, in The Tale of Genji, written in the early 11th century, men are frequently moved by the beauty of youths. In one scene the hero is rejected by a lady and instead sleeps with her young brother: \\"Genji pulled the boy down beside him ... Genji, for his part, or so one is informed, found the boy more attractive than his chilly sister\\".The Tale of Genji. Edward G. Seidensticker (trans.) p. 48.

Nanshoku relationships inside monasteries were typically pederastic: an age-structured relationship where the younger partner is not considered an adult. The older partner, or , would be a monk, priest or abbot, while the younger partner was assumed to be an , who would be a prepubescent or adolescent boy;Childs, Margaret (1980). \\"Chigo Monogatari: Love Stories or Buddhist Sermons?\\".

Both parties were encouraged to treat the relationship seriously and conduct the affair honorably, and the nenja might be required to write a formal vow of fidelity. Outside of the monasteries, monks were considered to have a particular predilection for male prostitutes, which was the subject of much ribald humor.Pflugfelder, Gregory M. (1997). Cartographies of desire: male‚Äìmale sexuality in Japanese discourse, 1600‚Äì1950. University of California Press. p. 26, 39‚Äì42, 75, 70-71, 252, There is no evidence so far of religious opposition to homosexuality within Japan in non-Buddhist traditions.The Greenwood encyclopedia of LGBT issues worldwide, Volume 1, Chuck Stewart, p.430; accessed through Google Books Tokugawa commentators felt free to illustrate kami engaging in anal sex with each other. During the Tokugawa period, some of the Shinto gods, especially Hachiman, Myoshin, Shinmei and Tenjin, \\"came to be seen as guardian deities of nanshoku\\" (male‚Äìmale love). Tokugawa-era writer Ihara Saikaku joked that since there are no women for the first three generations in the genealogy of the gods found in the Nihon Shoki, the gods must have enjoyed homosexual relationships‚Äîwhich Saikaku argued was the real origin of nanshoku.Leupp 1997, p. 32. In contrast to the norms in religious circles, in the warrior (samurai) class it was customary for a boy in the wakash≈´ age category to undergo training in the martial arts by apprenticing to a more experienced adult man. According to Furukawa, the relationship was based on the model of a typically older nenja, paired with a typically younger chigo. The man was permitted, if the boy agreed, to take the boy as his lover until he came of age; this relationship, often formalized in a \\"brotherhood contract\\", was expected to be exclusive, with both partners swearing to take no other (male) lovers. This practice, along with clerical pederasty, developed into the codified system of age-structured homosexuality known as shud≈ç, abbreviated from wakash≈´d≈ç, the \\"way (Tao) of wakash≈´\\". The older partner, in the role of nenja, would teach the chigo martial skills, warrior etiquette, and the samurai code of honor, while his desire to be a good role model for his chigo would lead him to behave more honorably himself; thus a shud≈ç relationship was considered to have a \\"mutually ennobling effect\\". In addition, both parties were expected to be loyal unto death, and to assist the other both in feudal duties and in honor-driven obligations such as duels and vendettas. Although sex between the couple was expected to end when the boy came of age, the relationship would, ideally, develop into a lifelong bond of friendship. At the same time, sexual activity with women was not barred (for either party), and once the boy came of age, both were free to seek other wakash≈´ lovers. Like later Edo same-sex practices, samurai shud≈ç was strictly role-defined; the nenja was seen as the active, desiring, penetrative partner, while the younger, sexually receptive wakash≈´ was considered to submit to the nenja's attentions out of love, loyalty, and affection, rather than sexual desired] Among the samurai class, adult men were (by definition) not permitted to take the wakash≈´ role; only preadult boys (or, later, lower-class men) were considered legitimate targets of homosexual desire. In some cases, shud≈ç relationships arose between boys of similar ages, but the parties were still divided into nenja and wakash≈´ roles.

Note that the youth on the left is wearing a kimono whose style (furisode) and color was considered appropriate for adolescents of both sexes but not adult men, which along with the partially shaved pate denotes the boy's wakash≈´ age status while the exposed bare feet indicates the purely sexual demeanor.  Kabuki and male prostitution  Male prostitutes (kagema), who were often passed off as apprentice kabuki actors and catered to a mixed male and female clientele, did a healthy trade into the mid-19th century despite increasing restrictions. Many such prostitutes, as well as many young kabuki actors, were indentured servants sold as children to the brothel or theater, typically on a ten-year contract. Relations between merchants and boys hired as shop staff or housekeepers were common enough, at least in the popular imagination, to be the subject of erotic stories and popular jokes. Young kabuki actors often worked as prostitutes off-stage, and were celebrated in much the same way as modern media stars are today, being much sought after by wealthy patrons, who would vie with each other to purchase the Kabuki actors favors. Onnagata (female-role) and wakash≈´-gata (adolescent boy-role) actors in particular were the subject of much appreciation by both male and female patrons, and figured largely in nanshoku shunga prints and other works celebrating nanshoku, which occasionally attained best-seller status. Male prostitutes and actor-prostitutes serving male clientele were originally restricted to the wakash≈´ age category, as adult men were not perceived as desirable or socially acceptable sexual partners for other men. During the 17th century, these men (or their employers) sought to maintain their desirability by deferring or concealing their coming-of-age and thus extending their \\"non-adult\\" status into their twenties or even thirties; this eventually led to an alternate, status-defined shud≈ç relationship which allowed clients to hire \\"boys\\" who were, in reality, older than themselves. This evolution was hastened by mid-17th-century bans on the depiction of the wakash≈´'s long forelocks, their most salient age marker, in kabuki plays; intended to efface the sexual appeal of the young actors and thus reduce violent competition for their favors, this restriction eventually had the unintended effect of de-linking male sexual desirability from actual age, so long as a suitably \\"youthful\\" appearance could be maintained.

However, English translations are available for Ihara Saikaku who created a bisexual main character in The Life of An Amorous Man (1682), Jippensha Ikku who created an initial gay relationship in the post-publication \\"Preface\\" to Shank's Mare (1802 et seq), and Ueda Akinari who had a homosexual Buddhist monk in Tales of Moonlight and Rain (1776). Likewise, many of the greatest artists of the period, such as Hokusai and Hiroshige, prided themselves in documenting such loves in their prints, known as ukiyo-e \\"pictures of the floating world\\", and where they had an erotic tone, shunga \\"pictures of spring.\\" Nanshoku was not considered incompatible with heterosexuality; books of erotic prints dedicated to nanshoku often presented erotic images of both young women (concubines, mekake, or prostitutes, j≈çr≈ç) as well as attractive adolescent boys (wakash≈´) and cross-dressing youths (onnagata). Indeed, several works suggest that the most \\"envious\\" situation would be to have both many j≈çr≈ç and many wakash≈´.Mostow, Joshua S. (2003), \\"The gender of wakashu and the grammar of desire\\", in Joshua S. Mostow; Norman Bryson; Maribeth Graybill, Gender and power in the Japanese visual field, University of Hawaii Press, pp. 49‚Äì70 Likewise, women were considered to be particularly attracted to both wakash≈´ and onnagata, and it was assumed that many of these young men would reciprocate that interest. Therefore, both many practitioners of nanshoku and the young men they desired would be considered bisexual in modern terminology. Men and male youths (there are examples of both) who were purely homosexual might be called \\"woman-haters\\" (onna-girai); this term, however, carried the connotation of aggressive distaste of women in all social contexts, rather than simply a preference for male sexual partners. Not all exclusively homosexual men were referred to with this terminology.  Exclusive homosexuality and personal sexual identity  The Great Mirror of Male Love (Áî∑Ëâ≤Â§ßÈè°) by Ihara Saikaku was the definitive work on the subject of \\"male love\\" in Tokugawa Era Japan. In his introduction to The Great Mirror of Male Love, Paul Gordon Schalow writes, \\"In the opening chapter of Nanshoku Okagami, Saikaku employed the title in its literal sense when he stated ‚ÄòI have attempted to reflect in this great mirror all of the varied manifestations of male love.\\"‚Äô It was intended to be a societal reflection of all the different ways men in Tokugawa society loved other men. The most common narrative of male to male sex and/or love was what we would now consider a \\"bisexual\\" experience: the \\"connoisseur of boys\\" or shojin-zuki. This term was applied not simply to men who engaged in \\"bisexual\\" behavior, but most often to men who engaged sexually and/or romantically with boys often, but not exclusively. However, men who wished to only have sex/form relationships with boys (and men who filled the sociosexual role of \\"boy\\"): the exclusively \\"homosexual\\" \\"women haters\\" or onna-girai, were not stigmatized. In Male Colors by Leupp, he writes \\"In this brilliant, refined, and tolerant milieu, we have, not surprisingly, evidence of a self conscious sub-culture. Though the Great Mirror occasionally portrays bisexual behavior, it is noteworthy that Saikaku more often depicts devotees of male love as a class who think of themselves as exclusive in their preferences, stress this exclusiveness by calling themselves \\"women haters\\" (onna-girai) and forming a unique community‚Äîa ‚Äòmale love sect‚Äô. No other early society shows this phenomenon quite so clearly as seventeenth century Japan.\\" Paul Gordon Schalow references these concepts in his introduction to the full English translation of The Great Mirror of Male Love, writing, \\"interestingly, saikaku structured nanshoku okagami not around the \\"bisexual\\" ethos of the shojin-zuki, but around the exclusively \\"homosexual\\" ethos of the onna-girai.\\" The poem at the beginning of The Sword That Survived Loves Flame references a heroic \\"woman hater.\\" > Memories of a rice husker, a woman hater unto death, saving his birthplace > from disaster In this same story, we see a character refer to himself and a friend as \\"woman-haters\\" in good humor. \\"What a couple of woman haters we are!\\" he exclaims, after they both agree that the love of \\"beautiful youths\\" is \\"the only thing of interest in this world\\"The Love That Survived Loves Flame, The Great Mirror of Male Love. Paul Gordon Schalow (trans.) p. 138, 139. There were wakashu who would now be considered \\"homosexual,\\" wakashu who would now be considered \\"bisexual,\\" and wakashu who would now be considered \\"heterosexual,\\" as well as many who could not be easily sorted into these categories. References to wakashu exclusively interested in men were relatively common, as in the example of the popular actor described in the story Winecup Overflowing, who was sent many love letters from women, but who, \\"ignored them completely, not out of cold heartedness, but because he was devoted to the way of male love.\\"Winecup Overflowing, The Great Mirror of Male Love. Paul Gordon Schalow (trans.) p. 222. Wakashu who felt this way could simply transition to being the \\"man\\" partner to a \\"boy,\\" or, in some circumstances (of varying social acceptability), continue his life in the sociosexual role of \\"boy.\\" There is also much evidence of young men who engaged in this behavior out of duty, rather than love, or lust. Like in, The Boy Who Sacrificed His Life, where Saikaku writes, \\"it seems that Yata Nisaburo of whom you spoke to me in private is not a believer in boy love. He was not interested in the idea of having a male lover and so, though only seventeen and in the flower of youth, has foolishly cut off his forelocks. I found his profuse apologies rather absurd but have decided to let the matter drop. Last night everyone came over and we spent the whole night laughing about it....\\"The Boy Who Sacrificed His Life, The Great Mirror of Male Love. Paul Gordon Schalow (trans.) p. 168. Another Tokugawa author, Eijima Kiseki, who references exclusive homosexuality, writes of a character in his 1715 The Characters of Worldly Young Men, \\"who had never cared for women: all his life he remained unmarried, in the grip of intense passions for one handsome boy after another.\\" There is a genre of stories dedicated to debating the value of \\"male colors,\\" \\"female colors,\\" or the \\"following of both paths.\\" \\"Colors\\" here indicating a specific way of sexual desire, with the desire coming from the adult male participant, to the receiving woman or \\"youth.\\" Depending on what audience the story was written for, the answer to the preferred way of life might be that the best way is to be exclusive to women, moderately invested in both women and boys, or exclusive to boys. Although these \\"ways of loving\\" were not considered incompatible, there were people and groups who advocated the exclusive following of one way, considered them spiritually at odds, or simply only personally experienced attractions in line with one of these \\"ways.\\"  Social role play in man and boy roles  Traditional expressions of male to male sexual and romantic activity were between a man who had gone through with his coming of age ceremony, and a male youth who had not. In his introduction to The Great Mirror of Male Love, Schallow writes, \\"a careful reading of nanshoku okagami makes clear that the constraint requiring that male homosexual relations be between an adult male and a wakashu was sometimes observed only in the form of fictive roleplaying. This meant that relations between pairs of man-boy lovers were accepted as legitimate whether or not a real man and a real boy were involved, so long as one partner took the role of ‚Äòman‚Äô and the other the role of ‚Äòboy.\\"' In Two Olds Cherry Trees, the protagonists are two men who have been in love since they were youths. The \\"man\\" in this relationship is sixty-six, and the \\"boy\\" in this relationship is sixty-three.Two Old Cherry Trees Still in Bloom, The Great Mirror of Male Love. Paul Gordon Schalow (trans.) p. 181. In the realm of male kabuki (as opposed to \\"boy\\" kabuki), Saikaku writes, \\"now, since everyone wore the hairstyle of adult men, it was still possible at age 34 or 35 for youthful- looking actors to get under a man‚Äôs robe...If skill is what the audience is looking for, there should be no problem in having a 70 year old perform as a youth in long sleeved robes. So long as he can continue to find patrons willing to spend the night with him, he can then enter the new year without pawning his belongings.\\"'Kichiya Riding a Horse, The Great Mirror of Male Love. Paul Gordon Schalow (trans.) p. 215. The protagonist of Saikaku's An Amorous Man hires the services of a \\"boy\\" who turns out to be ten years his senior, and finds himself disappointed. In the Ugetsu Monogatori, written by Ueda Akinari (1734-1809), the story Kikuka no chigiri is commonly believed to be about a romantic relationship between two adult men, where neither obviously holds the sociosexual role of wakashu, though they do structure it with their age difference in mind, using the \\"male love\\" terminology \\"older brother\\" versus \\"younger brother.\\" In the story of Haemon and Takashima, two adult men, they also use this terminology, and Takashima additionally presents himself as a wakashu. Mentions of men who openly enjoy both being the penetrating and penetrated partner are not found in these works, but are found in earlier Heian personal diaries, like in the diary of Fujiwara no Yorinaga, who writes on wanting to perform both the penetrative, and the receptive, sexual role. This is also referenced in a Muromachi era poem by the Shingon priest Socho (1448-1532). This may indicate that the mores surrounding appropriate homosexual conduct for men had changed rapidly in the course of one-to-two centuries.  Meiji Japan  As Japan progressed into the Meiji era, same-sex practices continued, taking on new forms. However, there was a growing animosity towards same-sex practices. Despite the animosity, nanshoku continued, specifically the samurai version of nanshoku, and it became the dominant expression of homosexuality during the Meiji period. Nanshoku practices became associated with the Satsuma region of Japan. The reason being that this area was deeply steeped in the nanshoku samurai tradition of the Tokugawa period. Also, when the satsuma oligarchs supported the restoration of power to the emperor, they were put into positions of power, allowing nanshoku practices to be brought more into the spotlight during this time period. Satsuma also made up the majority of the newly created Japanese navy, thus associating the navy with nanshoku practices. Though during this time Japan briefly adopted anti-sodomy laws in an attempt to modernize its code, the laws were repealed when a French legalist, G. E. Boissonade, advised adopting a similar legal code to France's. Despite this, nanshoku flourished during the time of the Sino and Russo-Japanese wars. This was due to the association of the warrior code of the samurai with nationalism. This led to close association of the bushido samurai code, nationalism, and homosexuality. After the Russo-Japanese war however, the practice of nanshoku began to die down, and it began to receive pushback.  Rejection of homosexuality  Eventually Japan began to shift away from its tolerance of homosexuality, moving towards a more hostile stance toward nanshoku. The Keikan code revived the notion of making sodomy illegal. This had the effect of criticizing an act of homosexuality without actually criticizing nanshoku itself, which at the time was associated with the samurai code and masculinity. The Keikan code came to be more apparent with the rise of groups of delinquent students that would engage in so called \\"chigo\\" battles. These groups would go around assaulting other students and incorporate them into their group, often engaging in homosexual activity. Newspapers became highly critical of these bish≈çnen-hunting gangs, resulting in an anti-sodomy campaign throughout the country. Sexology, a growing pseudo-science in Japan at the time, was also highly critical of homosexuality. Originating from western thought, Sexology was then transferred to Japan by way of Meiji scholars, who were seeking to create a more Western Japan. Sexologists claimed that males engaging in a homosexual relationship would adopt feminine characteristics and would assume the psychic persona of a woman. Sexologists claimed that homosexuality would degenerate into androgyny in that the very body would come to resemble that of a woman, with regard to such features such as voice timbre, growth of body hair, hair and skin texture, muscular and skeletal structure, distribution of fatty tissues, body odor and breast development.Pflugfelder, M. Gregory. 1999. \\"Cartographies of Desire: Male-Male Sexuality in Japanese Discourse, 1600- 1950\\": 256. Homosexuality in modern Japan Despite the recent trends that suggest a new level of tolerance, as well as open scenes in more cosmopolitan cities (such as Tokyo and Osaka), Japanese gay men and lesbian women often conceal their sexuality, with many even marrying persons of the opposite sex. Politics and law Japan has no laws against homosexual activity and has some legal protections for gay individuals. In addition, there are some legal protections for transgender individuals. Consensual sex between adults of the same sex is legal, but some prefectures set the age of consent for same-sex sexual activity higher than for opposite-sex sexual activity. While civil rights laws do not extend to protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation, some governments have enacted such laws. The government of Tokyo has passed laws that ban discrimination in employment based on sexual identity. The major political parties express little public support for LGBT rights. Despite recommendations from the Council for Human Rights Promotion, the National Diet has yet to take action on including sexual orientation in the country's civil rights code. Some political figures, however, are beginning to speak publicly about they themselves being gay. Kanako Otsuji, an assemblywoman from Osaka, came out as a lesbian in 2005. She became the first elected member of the House of Councillors and of the Diet in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Before that, in 2003, Aya Kamikawa became the first openly transgender person elected official in Tokyo, Japan. Taiga Ishikawa was elected in 2019, becoming the first open gay man to sit in the Diet. He was out also during his time previously as a ward councillor for Nakano. The current Constitution of Japan, which was written during American occupation, defines marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman. In an unconventional effort to circumvent marriage restrictions, some gay couples have resorted to using the adult adoption system, which is known as futsu, as an alternate means of becoming a family. In this method, the older partner adopts the younger partner which allows for them to be officially recognized as a family and receive some of the benefits that ordinary families receive such as common surnames and inheritance. In regards to the workplace, there are no anti-discrimination protections for LGBT employees. Employers play a visible role in reinforcing the Confucian tenets of marriage and procreation. Male employees are considered ineligible for promotions unless they marry and procreate. While same-sex marriage is not legalized at the national level, the Shibuya District in Tokyo passed a same-sex partnership certificate bill in 2015 to \\"issue certificates to same-sex couples that recognize them as partners equivalent to those married under the law.\\" Similar partnerships are available in Setagaya District (Tokyo), Sapporo (Hokkaido), Takarazuka (Hyogo), and over 20 other localities, as well as one prefecture (Ibaraki). Popular cultureMass media= A number of artists, nearly all male, have begun to speak publicly about being gay, appearing on various talk shows and other programs, their celebrity often focused on their sexuality; twin pop-culture critics Piko and Osugi are an example. Akihiro Miwa, a drag queen and former lover of author Yukio Mishima, is the television advertisement spokesperson for many Japanese companies ranging from beauty to financial products. Kenichi Mikawa, a former pop idol singer who now blurs the line between male and female costuming and make-up, can also regularly be seen on various programs, as can crossdressing entertainer Peter. Singer-songwriter and actress Ataru Nakamura was one of the first transgender personalities to become highly popular in Japan; in fact, sales of her music rose after she discussed her MTF gender reassignment surgery on the variety show All Night Nippon in 2006. Masaki Sumitani Some entertainers have used stereotypical references to homosexuality to increase their profile. Masaki Sumitani a.k.a. Hard Gay (HG), a comedian, shot to fame after he began to appear in public wearing a leather harness, hot pants, and cap. His outfit, name, and trademark pelvis thrusting and squeals earned him the adoration of fans and the scorn of many in the Japanese gay community. Ai Haruna and Ayana Tsubaki, two high- profile transgender celebrities, have gained popularity and have been making the rounds on some very popular Japanese variety shows. , Hiromi, a fashion model, came out publicly as a lesbian.\\"Model Hiromi comes out as a homosexual : 'Love doesn't have any form, color and rule'\\" , February 18, 2011, Yahoo! News - Yahoo! Japan from RBB Today A greater number of gay and transgender characters have also begun appearing (with positive portrayals) on Japanese television, such as the highly successful Hanazakari no Kimitachi e and Last Friends television series. Boys' Love drama Ossan's Love aired first in 2016 as a standalone TV movie and was expanded to a TV series in 2018. The programme was so successful that a movie sequel was released the following year entitled Ossan's Love: LOVE or DEAD. In 2019 male same-sex relationships became further visible with the popular adapated drama What Did You Eat Yesterday?. =Media= The gay magazine Adonis (ja) of the membership system was published in 1952. In 1975 twelve women became the first group of women in Japan to publicly identify as lesbians, publishing one issue of a magazine called Subarashi Onna (Wonderful Women). With the rise in visibility of the gay community and the attendant rise of media for gay audiences, the Hadaka Matsuri (\\"Naked Festival\\") has become a fantasy scenario for gay videos.Male homosexuality in modern Japan: cultural myths and social realities By Mark J. McLelland, p.122; accessed through Google Books Gei-comi (\\"gay- comics\\") are gay-romance themed comics aimed at gay men. While yaoi comics often assign one partner as a \\"uke\\", or feminized receiver, gei-comi generally depict both partners as masculine and in an equal relationship. Another common term for this genre is bara, stemming from the name of the first publication of this genre to gain popularity in Japan, Barazoku. Yaoi works are massive in number with much of the media created by women usually for female audiences. In the west, it has quickly caught on as one of the most sought-after forms of pornography. There is certainly no disparity between yaoi as a pornographic theme, vs Yuri. Lesbian-romance themed anime and manga is known as yuri (which means \\"lily\\"). It is used to describe female-female relationships in material and is typically marketed towards straight people, homosexuals in general, or lesbians despite significant stylistic and thematic differences between works aimed at the different audiences. Another word that has become popular in Japan as an equivalent term to Yuri is \\"GL\\" (short for \\"Girls' Love\\" in opposite to \\"Boys' Love\\"). There are a variety of yuri titles (or titles that integrate yuri content) aimed at women, such as Revolutionary Girl Utena, Oniisama e..., Maria-sama ga Miteru, Sailor Moon (most notably the third and fifth seasons), Strawberry Shake Sweet, Love My Life, etc.; and there are a variety of yuri titles of anime such as Kannazuki no Miko, Strawberry Panic!, Simoun, and My-Hime. Comic Yuri Hime is a long-time running manga magazine in Japan that focuses solely on yuri stories, which gained merges from its other subsidiary comics and currently runs as the only Yuri Hime named magazine. Other magazines and anthologies of Yuri that have emerged throughout the early 21st century are Mebae, Hirari, and Tsubomi (the latter two ceased publication before 2014).

FitzOsbern was created Earl of Wessex, a title which his son did not inherit.The Normans: The History of a Dynasty, by David Crouch p100 He was created Earl of Hereford before 22 February 1067, one of the first peerage titles in the English peerage. He is one of the very few proven companions of William the Conqueror known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. His chief residence was Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight, one of many English castles he built. Origins William FitzOsbern was the son of Osbern the Steward, a nephew of Duchess Gunnor, the wife of Duke Richard I of Normandy. Osbern was the steward of his cousin Duke Robert I of Normandy. When Robert left the Duchy to his young son William, Osbern became one of Duke William's guardians. Osbern married Emma, a daughter of Count Rodolf of Ivry, who was a half-brother of Duke Richard I of Normandy. Through her he inherited a large property in central Normandy, including the honours of Pacy and Breteuil. Career pre-1066 William FitzOsbern was probably raised at the court of his cousin William the Bastard, and like his father, became one of the ducal stewards. He founded Cormeilles Abbey and Lyre AbbeyOrderic Vital, Histoire de Normandie, tome 2, Ed. Charles Corlet, Caen 1826-Paris 2009, p. 10 (La Vieille-Lyre), and Saint-Evroul Abbey.Orderic Vital, Histoire de Normandie, tome 2, Ed. Charles Corlet, Caen 1826-Paris 2009, p. 27 He was one of the earliest and most vigorous advocates of the invasion of England, and tradition holds that, at the Council of Lillebonne, he convinced the doubters amongst the Norman barons of the feasibility of the invasion. FitzOsbern's younger brother Osbern FitzOsbern was one of Edward the Confessor's chaplains, and possessed the rich church of Bosham in Sussex, where King Harold went to in the first scene of the Bayeux tapestry, and was well placed to pass along intelligence on the situation in England. He later became Bishop of Exeter. In England after 1066 As William the Bastard became King of England, FitzOsbern was given charge of the Isle of Wight, and then before 22 February 1067 he was created Earl of Hereford as well as Earl of Gloucester, Earl of Worcester and Earl of Oxfordshire.The Normans: The History of a Dynasty, by David Crouch p100 That western part of England was not yet fully under Norman control; the understanding must have been that FitzOsbern was to take charge of the conquest of these regions when he was able. In the summer of 1067 King William returned to Normandy and left his half-brother Bishop Odo of Bayeux and FitzOsbern in charge of England during his absence. The King was back in England in 1068 and FitzOsbern accompanied him in the subjugation of south-west England. He attended the King's Whitsun court in May 1068, and then visited Normandy, where he fell ill for some months. In February or March 1069 FitzOsbern was asked by William to oversee the peace in York, where Gilbert de Ghent was made castellan of the new castle, but FitzOsbern returned south in time to attend the King's Easter court in April 1069 before returning to York. Eadric the Wild launched a campaign of Anglo-Saxon resistance in the West Midlands, with the assistance of a number of Welsh princes (who had lately been allies of the Anglo-Saxon kings). In 1069 the revolt was crushed, and it is likely FitzOsbern played a major part in this, although the details are not certain. During this time FitzOsbern and his followers pushed on westwards into Wales, thus beginning the Norman conquest of the Welsh Kingdom of Gwent. Castle builder As part of the assertion of Norman control over England and Wales, FitzOsbern was one of the major Norman castle builders. Early castles attributed to him include Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight, Chepstow Castle (Striguil) in South Wales, Wigmore Castle and Clifford Castle in Herefordshire, Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire and Monmouth Castle in Wales. FitzOsbern also created or improved fortifications in the towns of Hereford and Shrewsbury. Distraction and death in Flanders In 1070 trouble arose in Flanders, where King William's brother-in-law Count Baldwin VI of Flanders had died, leaving his county and his young sons in the hands of his widow Richilde, Countess of Mons and Hainaut. Her control of Flanders was challenged by the brother of her late husband, Robert the Frisian. Looking for help, she offered herself in marriage to FitzOsbern. He could not resist the chance to become also Count of this rich principality close to Normandy, and hurried there with his army, where he was defeated by the Count of Flanders and killed in the Battle of Cassel on 22 February 1071. Marriages and progeny FitzOsbern married twice: *Firstly to Adeliza de Tosny, daughter of Roger I of Tosny, by whom he had three children: **William of Breteuil, who succeeded his father in Normandy. He was held captive and tortured by Ascelin Gouel de Perceval 'Lupus', Sire d'Yvry, until he finally granted his daughter Isabella de Breteuil in marriage to him.Francis Palgrave, The History of Normandy and of England... !V:398ff.Connected Blood Lines: Career of Ascelin Go√´l de Perceval, derived from Vita Domin√¶ Hildeburgis and other cited sources; accessed November 2017. **Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford, who succeeded his father in England and Wales; **Emma de Breteuil, wife of Ralph de Gael, 1st Earl of Norfolk *Secondly, it must be assumed, in 1070 he married Richilde, Countess of Mons and Hainaut shortly before the Battle of Cassel in 1071 by issuing a male descendent who was taken to the Burgundy region of Savoy. **Godfrey de Crepon Candie References *David C.

The screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows. The technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with any other animation technique, including traditional cel animation. Origin Pinscreen used for animation (Baby Screen model) The technique was invented and developed by Alexandre Alexe√Øeff and his wife Claire Parker in their own studio in Paris, between 1932 (first tests) and 1935, when Claire Parker registered in her own name the Brevet d¬¥Invention n¬∫ 792340 at the Direction de la Propri√©t√© Industrielle, Minist√®re du Commerce et de L¬¥Industrie, R√©publique Fran√ßaise, Paris 1935. They made a total of 6 very short films with it, over a period of fifty years. The films have short running time, because the device is difficult to use, and have a monochrome nature, due to the images being created using shadows over a white surface. Due to the poetic nature of the images produced and the quality of the film's animation, they won numerous awards over the years. There is no material evidence that the National Film Board of Canada was involved in the development of the technique. The National Film Board of Canada did buy one of the pinboards built by them and, as guests of the NFB, on August 7, 1972, Alexe√Øeff and Parker demonstrated the pinscreen to a group of animators at the NFB. Due to Cecile Starr (friend of Alexeieff and Parker, and distributor of their work in the US) most insisting intervention talking to Norman McLaren that the opportunity should not be missed to preserve Alexe√Øeff's knowledge, this demonstration was filmed, and later released by the NFB as Pin Screen. This film, along with \\"Pinscreen Tests\\" (1961), appear on disc 7 of the Norman McLaren: The Master's Edition DVD collection. In this film several animators can be seen in the end of the demonstration experimenting with the pinscreen board, including Caroline Leaf. Until his retirement in 2005, the National Film Board's Jacques Drouin remained involved in pinscreen animation. Drouin's pinscreen work included the 1976 film Mindscape/Le paysagiste. Mich√®le Lemieux, used the pinscreen with support of the NFB for her 2012 film Here and the Great Elsewhere. In 2015, the CNC acquired and restored the √âpinette, the last pinscreen that Alexe√Øeff and Parker built in 1977. Eight artists were invited to train on the newly restored device, under the direction of Lemieux as part of an initiative to inspire a new generation of pinscreen artists. French animator Justine Vuylsteker was one of the artists selected for the intensive four-week residency on the √âpinette. This residency led Vuylsteker to complete the short film Embraced in 2018. Ward Fleming patented the vertical three-dimensional image screen, a toy which to date has sold more than 50 million pieces worldwide. United States Patent Smaller, cheaper models have since been developed as a 5√ó7 inch toy version called \\"Pin Art\\", sometimes sold in science museums or through the Web and printed catalogs. This device, even if it might have been inspired by the pinscreen board technique, should not be called pinscreen: there are some similarities to the original pinscreen created by Alexe√Øeff and Parker but these similarities do not make it a pinscreen. It is made of freely moving nails, instead of movement resistant headless pins. The nails form some sort of image by density distribution, while in the original pinscreen the images are created with cast shadows. Without cast shadows there is no pinscreen. The pinscreen device Close-up of a Baby Screen pinscreen from aside A pinscreen is a white screen perforated with thousands of pins in small holes. Light shines from the side of the screen causing each pin to cast a shadow. Each pin, being able to slide back and forth through the holes, can cast different shadows. The pins do not move easily, presenting some resistance to movement in order to avoid unintended dislocation and thus image error. The pins' motion resistance depends on the pinscreen calibration. The white screen becomes darker the farther the pins are pushed out, protruding from the surface. The more the pins are pushed in less shadows are cast, the lighter the screen becomes, giving a grayish tone and eventually an all-white screen again. The animation technique According to Claire Parker, the images created by the pinscreen made it possible to make an animated movie which escaped from the flat, \\"comic\\" aspect of cel animation and plunged instead into the dramatic and the poetic by the exploitation of chiaroscuro, or shading effects. To obtain the desired gray tones that are cast from the shadows of the pins, several methods are used. The original pinscreens built and used by Alexe√Øeff and Parker had more than 1 million pins. Today those pinscreens are at National Center of Cinematography and the moving image, near Paris. The pinscreen currently in Montreal, at National Film Board of Canada, has 240,000 pins. The pins are usually pressed with a small tool, groups of pins at a time, or with other specialized instruments. Being so thin, it is very difficult, and actually not desirable, to manipulate individual pins: moving one pin at a time there is the risk that it bends, thus ruining the pinscreen. Furthermore, the shadow cast by one single pin is negligible, almost non perceivable; only when manipulated in groups are the pins' shadows sufficiently dense to produce the chiaroscuro effect. Groups of pins are pressed and protruded with different tools, from specially created ones to more mundane, such as lamp bulbs, spoons, forks, and even Russian Matryoshka dolls. Frames are created one at a time, each frame being the incremental modification of the previous one. After each frame has been photographed, the images are strung together to create an image without pauses. The frame assembly containing the pins was built very solidly and mounted in a secure fashion to offer a stable image to the animation camera day after day, week after week as each image of the movie was painstakingly composed. This form of animation is extremely time consuming and difficult to execute, rendering it the least popular method of animation. An additional reason for its unpopularity is its expensive nature. Individually, the pins are relatively cheap; however, it is not uncommon that a million or more may be used to complete a single screen, quickly increasing the cost for manufacture. Probably the most famous use of Pin Screen technique is Orson Welles' 1962 film of Kafka's novel The Trial; the film begins with a brief but striking memorable Pin Screen segment, elements of which reappear in a later scene projected onto and behind the actors. Digital pinscreen animation Because of the cost and labor-intensive animation process, several computer programs have been made with the goal of simulating the images generated by a physical pinscreen. One of the advantages of using digital pinscreen animation is the recovery of images. With the traditional pinscreen, there is no way to recover a previous image except for creating it all over again with no guarantee of precision. With digital pinscreen, the same image can be retrieved and altered without having to be recreated.

The game was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy consoles. Both versions were first released simultaneously in Japan on December 14, 1991, and released in all other regions the following year. In Yoshi, the player is tasked with clearing monsters from the on-screen playing field. The monsters fall in from the top of the screen to build vertical stacks; the player must prevent a stack from growing too high such that it exits the play field. In order to do so, the player swaps and moves the stacks about such that falling monsters collide with identical monsters stationed atop the stacks, causing them to be removed from play. Yoshi offers both a scoring-focused single- player mode and a competitive two-player mode. Gameplay The playing field is divided into four columns in which blocks fall from the top to the bottom. Yoshi is a falling block game in which the player is given a playing field that is divided into four columns. The objective is to match Yoshi egg shells to hatch them and prevent the four stacks, which pile up from the falling monsters, from growing too tall. The player character, Mario, swaps the stacks around such that the falling monsters will be eliminated by coming into contact with the blocks they match. Monsters, which consist of various Mario enemies, appear at the top of the screen and fall into each the columns, turning into blocks as they land and creating stacks that incrementally grow in height. The main objective is to prevent the four stacks from growing too high by eliminating blocks from the field; a game over occurs when any of the stacks crosses the black line drawn across the top of the play field. To eliminate a block from the top of a stack, it must come in contact with a falling monster that matches it. For example, if a Goomba falls directly onto a Goomba block, both will be removed. The player controls Mario, who resides below the playing field and has the ability to swap the positions of any two adjacent stacks at a time. Thus, the player is required to switch around the stacks to ensure that the monsters fall into the correct places. Points are awarded for each set of monsters that are eliminated. In addition to the four different types of monsters, two halves of a Yoshi eggshell will also fall. The bottom eggshell half behaves like a monster: it disappears when it comes into contact with another bottom half. However, if a falling top half comes into contact with a bottom half, the two will join and hatch a Yoshi, earning the player bonus points. Furthermore, if a stack of monsters grows atop a bottom half and a top half is then added, all monsters between the halves will be encased and eliminated. Larger Yoshi characters will hatch depending on the number of monsters encased, which also increases the number of bonus points awarded. If a falling top half does not have any bottom half to join to in the stack it touches, it is automatically removed and no points are awarded. The single-player mode has two variations: A-Type and B-Type. In A-Type, the game is played indefinitely until the player receives a game over. In B-Type, the player plays a series of levels in which the player is required to completely clear the playing field of all the blocks. The initial number of blocks inside the playing field grows as the player progresses. In multiplayer mode, a second player controls Luigi. The two players play simultaneously in separate playing fields using the traditional rules. A player wins the match by clearing all the blocks in the field or when the other receives a game over; the first player to win three matches wins overall. Release The NES version of Yoshi was made available for purchase on the Virtual Console service. The first one is for the Wii in 2007. The game was then re-released on September 1, 2011 as a downloadable title on the Nintendo 3DS, available only to members of the Nintendo Ambassador program. Yoshi was made available for purchase in the Nintendo eShop on August 22, 2012 in Japan, on February 21, 2013 in North America and on May 2, 2013 in Europe. It was also released for the Wii U on June 12, 2013 as the part of the 30th anniversary of the Famicom with the price of 30 cents which become the regular price starting on July 12, 2013. Yoshi was also released on Nintendo's new NES online subscription service through Nintendo Switch Online on September 18, 2018. Reception Yoshi received a mixed reception, with common criticism directed towards its perceived repetitive gameplay and dependence on luck, which led to short replay value. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame called Yoshi a \\"surprisingly dull game,\\" noting that while the game's controls are unique, \\"the novelty wears off after a while.\\" Reviews of Yoshis Virtual Console release on Wii in 2007 were also mixed. Both Frank Provo of GameSpot and Lucas M. Thomas of IGN rated Yoshi 5 out of 10. Thomas regarded the gameplay as \\"slow\\" and the controls \\"cumbersome,\\" and concluded that the game is a \\"beginner's puzzler, holding little appeal for experienced players\\". While Provo complimented both the game's graphics and music, he stated that the gameplay did not involve much strategy, inciting little reason to play more than a few minutes. Nintendo Life felt that Yoshi was \\"uninspired\\", rating the game 4 out of 10. Several websites that covered recent Virtual Console releases recommended that players refrain from purchasing Yoshi. Nintendo World Report stated that \\"there's too much luck and chance in the game to make playing it satisfying,\\" and Joystiq also stated that \\"while [the gameplay is] admittedly a pretty interesting way to spend an afternoon, it still feels like kind of a ripoff.\\" Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com stated that the gameplay in Yoshi was \\"not enough to justify the asking price [of 500 points],\\" though he later stated that, compared to the \\"uninspired\\" Yoshi's Cookie, Yoshi was \\"decent and actually had some relationship to the Mario series.\\" On the more positive side, the Europress gaming magazine N-Force stated in a preview for the game in its September 1992 issue that \\"basically [the game] is great. The fun of Tetris, but with colour and sound effects. Just as hard, maybe harder ‚Äì definitely just as addictive.\\" It later rated the game 4 out of 5 in the Buyers' Guide for its January 1993 issue, summarizing that \\"Yoshi is great fun. Gameplay's nothing new ‚Äì Tetris all over again! Graphics are a treat. Lots of fun ‚Äì in short bursts.\\" Yoshi sold 500,000 copies in Japan on its first day on sale.

Sometimes speakers fall silent when they hesitate in searching for a word, or interrupt themselves before correcting themselves. Discourse analysis shows that people use brief silences to mark the boundaries of prosodic units, in turn-taking, or as reactive tokens, e.g., as a sign of displeasure, disagreement, embarrassment, desire to think, confusion, and the like. Relatively prolonged intervals of silence can be used in rituals; in some religious disciplines, people maintain silence for protracted periods, or even for the rest of their lives, as an ascetic means of spiritual transformation. Social uses=In danger Joseph Jordania has suggested that in social animals (including humans), silence can be a sign of danger. Many social animals produce seemingly haphazard sounds which are known as contact calls. These are a mixture of various sounds, accompanying the group's everyday business (for example, foraging, feeding), and they are used to maintain audio contact with the members of the group. Some social animal species communicate the signal of potential danger by stopping contact calls and freezing, without the use of alarm calls, through silence. Charles Darwin wrote about this in relation with wild horse and cattle. Jordania has further suggested that human humming could have been a contact method that early humans used to avoid silence. According to his suggestion, humans find prolonged silence distressing (suggesting danger to them). This may help explain why lone humans in relative sonic isolation feel a sense of comfort from humming, whistling, talking to themselves, or having the TV or radio on. In spirituality \\"Silence\\" in spirituality is often a metaphor for inner stillness. A silent mind, freed from the onslaught of thoughts and thought patterns, is both a goal and an important step in spiritual development. Such \\"inner silence\\" is not about the absence of sound; instead, it is understood to bring one in contact with the divine, the ultimate reality, or one's own true self, one's divine nature.See Stephen Palmquist, Ontology and the Wonder of Silence, Part Four of The Tree of Philosophy (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 2000). See also \\"Silence as the Ultimate Fulfillment of the Philosophical Quest\\", Journal Hekmat Va Falsafeh, (Journal of Wisdom and Philosophy), Issue 6 (August 2006), pp.67‚Äì76. Many religious traditions imply the importance of being quiet and still in mind and spirit for transformative and integral spiritual growth to occur. In Christianity, there is the silence of contemplative prayer such as centering prayer and Christian meditation; in Islam, there are the wisdom writings of the Sufis who insist on the importance of finding silence within. In Buddhism, the descriptions of silence and allowing the mind to become silent are implied as a feature of spiritual enlightenment. In Hinduism, including the teachings of Advaita Vedanta and the many paths of yoga, teachers insist on the importance of silence, Mauna, for inner growth. Perkey Avot, the Jewish Sages guide for living, states that, \\"Tradition is a safety fence to Torah, tithing a safety fence to wealth, vows a safety fence for abstinence; a safety fence for wisdom ... is silence.\\" In some traditions of Quakerism, communal silence is the usual context of worship meetings, in patient expectancy for the divine to speak in the heart and mind.Britain Yearly Meeting, \\"Quaker Faith and Practice\\"Third Edition, 2005 (?), sections 2.01, 2.12‚Äì17 etc., The Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Britain, London, / Eckhart Tolle says that silence can be seen either as the absence of noise, or as the space in which sound exists, just as inner stillness can be seen as the absence of thought, or the space in which thoughts are perceived. Commemorative silence Forward Operating Base Warrior, Kirkuk, Iraq, Sept. 11. The march gave Soldiers the opportunity to reflect on the tragedy that happened eight years prior. A common way to remember a tragic incident and to remember the victims or casualties of such an event is a commemorative moment of silence. In debate Argumentative silence is the rhetorical practice of saying nothing when an opponent in a debate expects something to be said. Poorly executed, it can be offensive, like refusing to answer a direct question. However, well-timed silence can throw an opponent off and give the debater the upper hand. An argument from silence () is an argument based on the assumption that someone's silence on a matter suggests (an informal fallacy) that person's ignorance of the matter. In general, ex silentio refers to the claim that the absence of something demonstrates the proof of a proposition. In law The right to silence is a legal protection enjoyed by people undergoing police interrogation or trial in certain countries. The law is either explicit or recognized in many legal systems. In art, entertainment, and media=Film The documentary film In Pursuit of Silence (2016) portrays the spiritual and physical benefits of silence, as well as the price paid individually and collectively for a noisy world. It is narrated by authors Helen Lees (Silence in Schools), Pico Iyer (The Art of Stillness), Susan Cain (Quiet), Maggie Ross (Silence: A User‚Äôs Guide), and George Prochnik (In Pursuit of Silence). Music Music inherently depends on silence, in some form or another, to distinguish other periods of sound and allow dynamics, melodies, and rhythms to have greater impact. For example, most music scores feature rests, which denote periods of silence. In addition, silence in music can be seen as a time for contemplation. The audience feels the effects of the previous notes and melodies, and can intentionally reflect on what they have heard. Silence does not hinder musical excellence but can enhance the sounds of instruments and vocals within a given musical composition.: In his book Sound and Silence (1970), the composer John Paynter says, \\"the dramatic effect of silence has long been appreciated by composers.\\" He gives as an example \\"the general pause in the middle of the chorus ‚ÄòHave lightnings and thunders ‚Ä¶‚Äô in Bach‚Äôs St. Matthew Passion\\":Bach, \\"Sind Blitze, sind Donner\\" (chorus) from the St. Matthew Passion. \\"Sind Blitze, sind Donner\\" (chorus) from the St. Matthew Passion. After the pause, the music continues to the words: \\"Open up the fiery bottomless pit, O hell!\\" The silence is intended to communicate a momentary sensation of terror, of staring into unfathomable darkness. Another example of a dramatic silence comes in the \\"rest full of tension\\" at the climactic ending of the Hallelujah chorus in Handel‚Äôs Messiah:Handel, Hallelujah Chorus closing barsHandel, Hallelujah Chorus closing bars Musical silences may also convey humour. Haydn's Quartet in E flat, Op. 33 was nicknamed \\"The Joke\\", because of the comic timing of the pauses at the end of the last movement: The closing bars of String Quartet in E flat, Op. 33 by Haydn The closing bars of String Quartet in E flat, Op. 33 by Haydn. Taruskin (2010, p. 552) says, \\"whenever this ending is performed, it takes the audience an extra second or so to recover its wits and realize that the piece is indeed over. The result is an inevitable giggle‚Äîthe same giggle that overtakes a prestidigitator‚Äôs audience when it realizes that it has been ‚Äòhad‚Äô.\\" Barry Cooper (2011, p.38) writes extensively of Beethoven's many uses of silence for contemplation, for dramatic effect and especially for driving the rhythmic impetus of the music. He cites the start of the second movement of the Ninth Symphony, where the silences contribute to a powerful sense of propulsion: \\"The rhythm of bar 1 is incomplete and demands a note at the beginning of bar 2. The substitution of such a note by a whole-bar rest therefore gives the effect of a suppressed sound, as if one were about to speak but then refrains at the last moment. The 'suppressed sound' is then repeated in bar 4, and 'developed' (by being doubled) in bars 7 and 8.\\" writes of the \\"strange irregularity of rhythm in the sixth bar\\" of this movement.Grove, G. (1898, p.355) Beethoven and his Nine Symphonies. London, Novello. Reprinted by Dover (1962) The opening bars of the scherzo from Beethoven's ninth symphonyThe opening bars of the scherzo from Beethoven's ninth symphony. Much has been said about the harmony of the opening to Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde, which Taruskin (2010, p.540) calls \\"perhaps the most famous, surely the most commented-on, single phrase of music ever written.\\" However, Wagner‚Äôs strategic use of silences between phrases intensifies the troubled ambiguity of the music: \\"The chord that fills the ensuing silence in the listener‚Äôs inner ear‚Ä¶ is the unstated ‚Äì indeed never to be stated, and ultimately needless to be stated ‚Äì tonic of that key.\\"Taruskin, Richard (2010) The Oxford History of Western Music, Volume 3. Oxford University Press.Wagner, Tristan Prelude, openingWagner, Prelude to Tristan and Isolde, opening bars. Some of the most effective musical silences are very short, lasting barely a fraction of a second. In the spirited and energetic finale of his Symphony No. 2, Brahms uses silences at several points to powerfully disrupt the rhythmic momentum that has been building. (See also syncopation.) Brahms Symphony No. 2, finale, bars 135-142Brahms Symphony No. 2 finale, bars 135-142 During the 20th century, composers explored further the expressive potential of silence in their music.Lossef, N. and Doctor, J. (eds.) (2007) Silence, Music, Silent Music. London, Ashgate The contemplative concluding bars of Anton Webern‚Äôs Symphony (1928) and Stravinsky's Les Noces The Wedding, 1923) make telling and atmospheric use of pauses. Eric Walter White (1947, p.74) describes the ending of Les Noces as follows: \\"As the voices cease singing, pools of silence come flooding in between the measured strokes of the bell chord, and the music dies away in a miraculously fresh and radiant close.\\"White, E. W. (1947) Stravinsky: a Critical Survey. London, John Lehmann. John Paynter (1970, p. 24) vividly conveys how silence contributes to the titanic impact of the third section of Messiaen‚Äôs orchestral work Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum (1964): > Woodwinds jump, growl and shriek. Silence. Eight solemn bell strokes echo > and die. Again silence. Suddenly the brasses blare, and out of the > trombones‚Äô awesome processional grows a steady roar ‚Ä¶ the big gongs the tam- > tam beaten in a long and powerful resonance, shattering and echoing across > mountains and along valleys. This is music of the high hills, music for vast > spaces: ‚ÄòThe hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of > God‚Äô. We can feel the awe and the majesty of the High Alps and the great > churches. The instrumental sounds are vast the silences are deep. The words > of St John are alive in the music, and through these sounds Messiaen reveals > himself and his vision. An extreme example from 1952 is 4‚Ä≤33‚Ä≥, an experimental musical work by avant- garde composer John Cage, incorporating ambient sounds not foreseeable by the composer. Though first performed on the piano, the piece was composed for any instrument or instruments and is structured in three movements. The length of each movement is not fixed by the composer, but the total length of the combination of three movements is. The score instructs the performer(s) to remain silent throughout the piece.Cage, J.(1952), 4‚Äô33\\", Published by Edition Peters (PE.P06777) There are telling examples of the use of silence in jazz. A frequently used effect, known as \\"stop-time\\", places silences at moments where listeners or dancers might expect a strong beat, contributing to the syncopation. Scott Joplin's Rag-Time Dance (1902) features stop-time silences: Scott Joplin, from the Rag-Time Dance (1902) Scott Joplin, Rag-Time Dance (1902) Early recordings of the Rag Time Dance follow Joplin‚Äôs instructions as follows: \\"To get the desired effect of 'Stop Time', the pianist will please stamp the heel of one foot heavily upon the floor.\\"Joplin, S. (1971) Collected Piano Works: Rags, Waltzes and Marches. New York Public Library. However, later recordings disregard this direction ‚Äì the regular beat is implied rather than stated and the silences are more palpable. Keith Swanwick (1979, p.70) is enchanted by the \\"playfulness and humour\\" engendered by the stop-time effects in Jelly Roll Morton's solo piano recording of The Crave (1939): \\"If we listen to this, tapping or clicking along with the beat, we shalt find ourselves surprised by two patches of silence near the end. The beat goes on but the sound stops. The effect is something like being thrown forward when a car stops suddenly. It is the biggest surprise in an engaging piece of music full of little deviations (syncopations) from the repeated beat.\\"Swanwick, K. (1979) A Basis for Music Education. London, Routledge. Other examples include the closing bars of Louis Armstrong's recording of Struttin' with Some Barbecue (1928) and the hair's-breadth pause at the end of pianist Bill Evans' solo on Miles Davis' recording of On Green Dolphin Street (1959). Duke Ellington's \\"Madness in Great Ones\\", from his Shakespearean Suite Such Sweet Thunder (1957) conveys the feigned madness of Prince Hamlet through abrupt and unpredictable pauses that interrupt the flow of the music. The reggae band Black Slate had a hit in 1980 with the song Amigo. The instrumental introduction features sudden silences before the voice enters.

Character introduction Kai Lung is a Chinese storyteller whose travels and exploits serve mainly as excuses to introduce substories, which generally take up the majority of a Kai Lung book. Character sketch=Motivations Kai Lung is a man of very simple motivations; most frequently, he is animated by a desire for enough taels to be able to feed and clothe himself. Otherwise, his main motivation is love for his wife, Hwa-mei, and he seeks nothing more than a simple, sustainable lifestyle. Generally, he does not intrude in other people's affairs unless he thinks it necessary to teach them the rudiments of classical proportion with one of his fables. Conflicts This character usually comes into conflict with barbarians, bandits, and other people who are not classically educated, as well as various unscrupulous individuals who are intent on taking away his property. In other authors In The Stray Lamb by Thorne Smith, the character Mr. Lamb relaxes while reading Kai Lung. Dorothy L. Sayers mentions him in several Lord Peter Wimsey novels: * In chapter IV of Strong Poison Wimsey says that Harriet Vane's ability to quote Kai Lung is a sign that they \\"should certainly get on together.\\" * In chapter XV of Gaudy Night he tells her that Kai Lung is an author who suits his tastes: \\"My tastes are fairly catholic. It might easily have been Kai Lung or Alice in Wonderland or Machiavelli‚Äî\\". * In chapter VII of Busman's Honeymoon Peter quotes from Kai Lung's Golden Hours to Superintendent Kirk: \\"... entrancing it is to wander through a garden of bright images...\\" In 'He cometh and he passeth by' by H. Russell Wakefield, one of the principal characters reads The Wallet of Kai- Lung before retiring to bed. Ford Madox Ford repeatedly quoted the allegedly Chinese proverb \\"It would be hypocrisy to seek for the person of the Sacred Emperor in a Low Tea House.\\" It has been convincingly argued that Ford originally acquired this proverb from the Kai Lung novels of Ernest Bramah, and that Bramah had created it for Kai Lung, rather than quoting a genuine Chinese proverb.Hawthorn, Jeremy, ‚ÄòErnest Bramah: Source of Ford Madox Ford‚Äôs Chinese Proverb?‚Äô Notes and Queries, 63.2 (2016), 286-288.

Its remains were uncovered in 1916 during the construction of the New York City Subway on land that is now part of the World Trade Center complex. History In late summer of 1613, Tyger had moored in Lower Manhattan on the Hudson to trade with the Lenape Indians along with its partner Hendrick Christiaensen's Fortuyn. By November, Tyger had been filled with pelts of beaver, otter, and other skins obtained in barter. In November, an accidental fire broke out and Tyger rapidly burned to the waterline.\\"Onrust and the Voyages of Captain Adriaen Block\\", Onrust.org The charred hull was beached and all but the small section of prow and keel salvaged in 1916 (q.v.) remained in that location, buried beneath what later became the intersection of Greenwich and Dey Streets in Lower Manhattan. During the fire, the crew salvaged some sails, rope, tools and fittings. Over the winter, Block and his menpresumably with help from the Indiansbuilt Onrust (Restless), which they used to explore the East River and Long Island Sound before returning to Europe in 1614. Rediscovery In 1916, workmen led by James A. Kelly uncovered the prow and keel of Tyger while excavating an extension for the New York City Subway BMT Broadway Line near the intersection of Greenwich and Dey Streets. The ship and some related artifacts were discovered by Kelly's crew at a depth of about below the streetright where it had been beached on the shoreline of Manhattan Island at the time of the ship's burning.\\"Fragment from the Dutch ship 'Tyger'\\", Luce Center, New York Historical Society Over a period of 150 years after the vessel had been beached, approximately of silt accumulated and, in 1763, a waterfront fill-in project added another . Although the excavation crew was under great pressure to keep the pace of work on schedule, Kelly persuaded his supervisors to allow sufficient excavation to remove about of prow and keel with three of the hull's ribs.Kelly, James A. Personal relation to his grandson John L. Kelly. The timbers were placed in the seal tank of the New York Aquarium in Battery Park. In 1943, they were presented to the Museum of the City of New York for exhibition in the Marine Gallery. The remainder of the ship may still rest approximately below ground, due east of the former site of the North Tower of the World Trade Center; however, it might have been dug up in the process of building the World Trade Center.

The AS/400 version of Synon/2 was named Synon/2E. *In 1989, Synon, along with Bachman, Intersolv, KnowledgeWare and Systematica, was chosen by IBM to be at the heart of AD/Cycle, its framework for application development and CASE. IBM later acquired an equity stake in Synon. *In 1990, French Connection sold its equity stake to General Atlantic Partners and TA Associates, two US VCs. As a condition of the transaction, Synon moved its HQ to Larkspur and became a Delaware corporation, changing its name to Synon Corporation. Shortly afterwards, Chris Herron became CEO. Simon Williams, who remained based in the UK, continued as Chairman and CTO. *In 1990, Technicolor Rome following the vision of IT Director: Vincenzo Compagnoni, used Synon (at that time, a pioneer technology), to develop its entire information system (6,000 RPG programs) computerising the whole Film Laboratory supply chain and demonstrating the consistency of CASE TOOL technologies. *In 1991, Synon launched Synon Model Applications, an accounting package developed using Synon/2E. In the same year, the company won the Queen's Awards for Technology and for Export, becoming one of only a handful of companies ever to win both awards in the same year. *In 1992, Simon Williams, believing that the company was in danger of missing the client/server technology wave, left Synon together with Melinda Horton to establish Dysys, a self-funded UK start-up whose object was to develop a client/server, cross-platform successor to Synon/2E. In 1993 Williams and Horton sold Dysys to Synon, and returned to the fold. Their new product, Obsydian, was launched by Synon in 1994. *In 1994, Synon/PE (Performance Expert) was created by Lou Kurrelmeyer and added to the Synon product line as a royalty product. Synon/PE analyzed 2E design models and suggested/automatically made corrections that reduced resource utilization by up to 600% when comparing end results of the executing application with starting results. *By 1997, Synon's revenue was $80 million, with around 6,000 customers worldwide. *In 1998, Synon was acquired by Sterling Software of Plano, Texas. Sterling continued to distribute and support Synon/2E and Obsydian as COOL:2E and COOL:Plex. La Crosse Management Systems of La Crosse, Wisconsin acquired Synon Model Applications from Sterling and continues to distribute it as La Crosse Financials. *In 2000, Sterling was acquired by Computer Associates (now CA), which continues to distribute and develop Synon/2E and Obsydian as CA 2E and CA Plex. Simon Williams went on to develop the Associative Model of Data and to found Lazysoft. Technology As early as 1986, Synon pioneered the approach to development which in early 2005 became known as Architected Rapid Application Development (ARAD). Such tools use abstract patterns as building blocks to automatically generate the components of an application. In Synon/2, developers use a specialized language to define an application's data model and the rules that ensure its integrity. They then select from a set of around 30 pre-built program design templates which perform edit, display and print functions in full screen, multi-line and transaction (full screen header above a multi-line detail) modes. Developers may further specialise the procedural logic of the selected templates and link templates together by using action diagrams. The tool then automatically instantiates the specialized templates over the data model and generates high-level language code in RPG or COBOL without any further developer intervention. It also generates the SQL or DDS code to define the necessary database tables and views. Synon kept precise productivity metrics during the internal development of its SMA accounting system. In total, 2,385 days of effort were expended on development and QA over a 14-month period, which resulted in the creation of 2.42 million lines of HLL code (excluding comments) in 2,081 programs. This is equivalent to the production of 1,016 lines of fully tested and documented code per person per day. The all-in, fully loaded cost (including management, design and end-user documentation) was ¬£416 per program. Synon/2 was also ahead of its time by adopting a strictly object oriented approach to the programs that it generated. For instance, programmers could not use native HLL commands to operate on database tables: instead, all physical database creates, changes and retrievals were encapsulated within individual templates, which were in turn evoked by generated programs. Thus programs could be automatically regenerated with no manual intervention following changes to the structure of the database. In 2001, CA introduced an add-on tool to CA 2E called Web Option, which allows 2E customers to web-enable their existing applications and to run those applications (which were originally designed for an IBM 'green-screen') inside a standard web browser. Obsydian follows the same general principles as Synon/2, with the important exception that developers can create and re-use their own abstract design templates. The CA Plex toolset also operates web and client-server applications, and generates in C#, C++, Java, RPG/III and IV/ILE IBM RPG and is multi-platform.

The River Westbourne running above the platforms of Sloane Square tube station. The drain is inside the green conduit above the train. The Westbourne or Kilburn is a converted small River Thames tributary in London, rising in Hampstead and Brondesbury Park and which as a drain unites and flows southward through Kilburn and Bayswater (west end of Paddington) to skirt underneath the east of Hyde Park's Serpentine lake then through central Chelsea under Sloane Square. It passes centrally under the south side of Royal Hospital Chelsea's Ranelagh Gardens before discharging into Inner London's old-fashioned, but grandiose combined sewer system; with exceptional discharges, to be abated by a 2021-completion scheme, into the Inner London Tideway. Since the latter 19th century, the population of its catchment has risen further but to reduce the toll it places on the Beckton Sewage Treatment Works and related bills its narrow basin has been assisted by private soakaways, and public surface water drains. Its depression has been replaced with and adopted as a reliable route for a gravity combined sewer. The formation of the Serpentine relied on the water, a lake with an long, ornate footbridge and various activities associated, which today uses little-polluted water from a great depth. Names The river was originally called the Kilburn (Cye Bourne ‚Äì royal stream, 'Bourne and burn' being the Germanic word equivalent to rivulet as in the geographical term 'winterbourne') but has been known, at different times and in different places, as Kelebourne, Kilburn, Bayswater, Bayswater River, Bayswater Rivulet, Serpentine River, The Bourne, Westburn Brook, the Ranelagh River and the Ranelagh Sewer. It is of similar size to the Fleet. Course Rising from several sources in Hampstead, and Brondesbury Park,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/LondonBeforeHouses.jpg the river or drain flows south through Kilburn (also the name of the river at that point) running west along Kilburn Park Road and then south along Shirland Road. After crossing Bishops Bridge Road, the river continued more or less due south, between what is now Craven Terrace and what is now Gloucester Terrace. At this point, the river was known until the early 19th century as the Bayswater rivulet and from that it gave its name to the area now known as Bayswater. Originally Bayswater was the stretch of the stream where it crosses Bayswater Road, \\"Bayards Watering\\" in 1652 and \\"Bayards Watering Place\\" in 1654. It is said that there is a reference to Bayards Watering Place as early as 1380. There were a few houses at this spot in the eighteenth century and, it seems, a man called Bayard used or offered it as a watering place for horses on this road (formerly Uxbridge Road). The river enters Hyde Park at what is now the Serpentine and is within the park joined by a tributary, Tyburn Brook. The Serpentine was formed in 1730 by building a dam across the Westbourne at the instigation of Queen Caroline, wife of George II, to beautify the royal park. The Westbourne ceased to provide the water for the Serpentine in 1834, as the culverted Westbourne had become the most convenient main sewer and the Serpentine is now supplied from three boreholes from the upper chalk underneath Hyde Park. The Serpentine was widely imitated in parks and gardens nationwide. The Westbourne left Hyde Park (both before and after it had been dammed to form the Serpentine) at Knightsbridge which was originally a bridge over the Westbourne itself. It is recorded that, in the year 1141, the citizens of London met Matilda of England (Queen Maud) at this bridge. The river ran from Knightsbridge south under Bourne Street, SW1 and follows very closely the boundary between the City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, joining the River Thames at Chelsea.http://Londonist.com/2009/11/londons_lost_rivers_from_above_the.php Londonist.com: London's lost rivers from above (Nov 2009) The waters of the Westbourne or Bayswater were originally pure and in 1437 and 1439 conduits were laid to carry water from the Westbourne into the City of London, for drinking. In the 19th century, however, the water became foul by its use as a sewer, and the rise of the water closet as the prevailing form of sanitation. When west Belgravia, east Chelsea and Paddington were developed, it was becoming obvious the river would have to remain a combined or foul sewer, with a certain storm element until such time as surface water drains (if ever) were built upstream. Pipes were therefore wrought in the early part of the 19th century with larger successors completed in the 1850s. The Westbourne is one of the lost rivers of London. The storm drain, combined sewer, pipe of the lower course can still be seen running above the platform of Sloane Square tube station.Clayton, Antony. ( 2000) Subterranean City: Beneath the Streets of London. London: Historical Publications. p. 34. It, made in the 19th century of riveted sections is below the ceiling towards the end of the platforms closest to the exits. The station was badly bombed during the Bombing of London in November 1940 but the pipe was not damaged. After flowing beneath the eastern lands of the Royal Military Hospital Gardens and beneath a corner of Chelsea Barracks, the drain was in all but exceptional storms entirely designed to be received by the Joseph Bazelgette-designed Northern Low Level Sewer. As some of its foul content overwhelms the system with further inflows from the west, an improvement, the Thames Tideway Scheme tunnel will enable that sewer to continue to cope. A clearance in sand against the tideway is about west of Chelsea Bridge. An emergency combined sewer overflow also called the Ranelagh Sewer, is obvious except at high tide. The combined sewer aims to be caught only by two intercept sewers capable of its flow, the Middle Level Sewer and the Northern Low Level Sewer in the London sewerage system. Maps The finest and most intelligible map of the whole course of the Westbourne, superimposed over the Victorian street plan, is found in an article by J. G. Waller, published in the Transactions of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society, vol VI (1882) pp 272‚Äì279. Waller's map shows that the stream never ran further west than the easternmost extremity of Westbourne Grove, Notting Hill (an east-west road ending at Queensway where the course lay). Westbourne Grove is, as its name suggests, west of the bourne.J. G. Waller Transactions of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society, vol VI (1882) pp 272‚Äì279.

Canadian Communications Foundation. It airs weekdays starting at 8:37 a.m. local time and runs until 10 a.m., and features interview sessions and radio documentaries that typically take up a half hour each. History The program premiered in 2002, and was hosted from its inception by investigative journalist Anna Maria Tremonti.\\"Anna Maria Tremonti switches to radio\\". Toronto Star, July 24, 2002. Tremonti retired from the program in June 2019.\\"Anna Maria Tremonti leaves CBC‚Äôs The Current after 17 seasons\\". The Globe and Mail, May 27, 2019. Laura Lynch served as interim host until the end of 2019, and Matt Galloway took over as the program's new permanent host effective January 6, 2020.Abhya Adlakha, \\"CBC‚Äôs Matt Galloway leaving ‚ÄòMetro Morning‚Äô for ‚ÄòThe Current‚Äô\\". Toronto Star, October 24, 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic until May 15, 2020, The Current's runtime was extended to the rest of the morning for most of the nation to cover that issue, replacing Q (although it still had its shorter evening broadcast slot) and the various half-hour 11:30 AM shows with the host of the former show, Tom Power appearing for selected arts stories related to the pandemic. In addition, the final hour was pre-empted in most of the nation's time zones by a daily scheduled public address by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and analysis of it with the remaining time of the final hour covered by reruns of interviews earlier of that day's show. Guest hosts On Fridays during the regular season period, a guest host was often used for the broadcast, who would be introduced on the preceding Thursday to read listener correspondence with Tremonti. Guest hosts are usually CBC personalities such as Maureen Taylor, Adrienne Arsenault, Nancy Wilson, Erica Johnson, Ian Hanomansing, Piya Chattopadhyay and Anthony Germain, although other Canadian journalists, including Haroon Siddiqui, Jan Wong and David Frum, have also appeared. In 2004, the program also did a one-off joint broadcast with the American radio program Democracy Now!, with Amy Goodman acting as the guest host of The Current.\\"In U.S., she's an exception to the rule; Amy Goodman asks the tough questions\\". Toronto Star, October 13, 2004. During the summer months of July and August, the regular host is replaced as host for the entire period with guests. Season long story themes From 2007 to 2018, the series ran regular season-long arcs of stories that dealt with a particular theme. The themes that were explored have included: * 2007-08 -\\"Diet for a Hungry Planet\\": Food and world hunger * 2008-09 - \\"Watershed\\": The politics and issues dealing with water * 2009-10 - \\"Work in Progress\\": labor and employment related issues. * 2010-11 - \\"Shift\\": Population demographics and the changing nature of Canada's population * 2011-12 - \\"Gamechangers\\": People and significant events that had made a noticeable change in the world in some fashion. * 2012-13 - \\"Line in The Sand: Dilemmas that Define Us\\": moral dilemmas. * 2013-14 - \\"Project Money\\": Money and related financial issues * 2014-15 - \\"By Design\\": Design issues such as Industrial and Social * 2015-16 - \\"Ripple Effect\\": Stories of consequences of various decisions and technologies, intended or otherwise. * 2016-17 - \\"The Disruptors\\": Stories of people, ideas and things that are disrupting today's society, both negatively and positively. * 2017-18 - \\"Adaptation\\": Stories of people adapting to changing realities in the world During the network's summer schedule when The Current was shortened to an hour, selections of these features were rerun as a separate half-hour program. In 2018, The Current ran at the regular length year-round with segments over the regular season rerun during the summer period in addition to new stories. However, in 2019, a compromise in the format was reached with the series running CBC Radio One's original documentary podcasts for the summer, having new content for the first portion of the show and taking advantage of the remaining hour's time to accommodate the podcasts' irregular length. Humour Although primarily a serious news program, The Current from 2003 to 2012 began each show with a brief satirical commentary by a character credited only as The Voice. The role was performed by actor Stephen Hart.\\"The Voice\\". The Globe and Mail, November 1, 2003. The Voice also announced fictional advertisements for the \\"Ambiguous Party\\", a fictional political party. A few campaign ads were created and aired for morning show listeners' amusement in which The Voice tried to persuade listeners to vote for the Ambiguous Party. Comparisons are made between the Ambiguous Party (complete and utter fence-sitters on all issues) and the current parties of the day. On June 20, 2019, Hart returned for a guest appearance to pay tribute to Anna Maria Tremonti on her last regular appearance as the show's host. Repeat airings An abbreviated edition of each day's program is repeated at 10 p.m. under the title The Current Review. Prior to 2008, The Review aired a single feature from The Current, alongside one from Sounds Like Canada, under the title Nighttime Review. The program is also currently repeated at 3 a.m. as part of the CBC Radio Overnight schedule. Although the overnight airing uses the same abbreviated edit as the previous evening's The Current Review, it is titled as The Current.

He became emperor in 419 after his developmentally disabled brother Emperor An was killed by the regent Liu Yu, and during his brief reign, actual power was in Liu Yu's hands. In 420, under pressure from Liu Yu, he yielded the throne to Liu Yu, ending Jin's existence. Liu Yu founded Liu Song, and in 421, believing that the former Jin emperor posed a threat to his rule, had him asphyxiated with a blanket. Early life Sima Dewen was the second son of Emperor Xiaowu of Jin and his concubine Consort Chen Guin√º in 386, born four years after Consort Chen had given birth to their oldest son, Sima Dezong. Contrary to his older brother who was described as so developmentally disabled that he was unable to speak, clothe himself, or express whether he was hungry or full, Sima Dewen was described as an intelligent child. From childhood, he became accustomed to care for his brother, especially after their mother's death in 390. Their father did not have any other sons. Despite Sima Dezong's severe developmental disability, he was made crown prince in 387 at the age of five by Emperor Xiaowu. In 392, Emperor Xiaowu bestowed upon Sima Dewen the title of \\"Prince of Langya\\" ‚Äî the second most prestigious title for a prince after \\"Crown Prince\\". In 396, Emperor Xiaowu was strangled by his favorite concubine Honoured Lady Zhang after making an offensive remark about her age, and in 397 Sima Dezong succeeded the throne as Emperor An of Jin. Sima Dewen continued to care for his brother after his ascension to the throne. During Emperor An's reign Sometime during Emperor An's reign, Sima Dewen married his wife, Chu Lingyuan, who was from an aristocratic family. She bore him two daughters, Sima Maoying, later created the Princess Haiyan, and the later Princess Fuyang. Throughout Emperor An's early reign, Sima Dewen received increasingly honorific offices, but had little actual power, as the power was initially in the hands of his uncle, the regent Sima Daozi the Prince of Kuaiji, and later in the hands of Sima Daozi's son Sima Yuanxian. The situation continued after Sima Yuanxian was overthrown by the warlord Huan Xuan in 402. In 403, Huan Xuan forced Emperor An to yield the throne to him, temporarily ending Jin. Huan Xuan established a new state of Chu, and he created Emperor An the Prince of Pinggu and Sima Dewen the Duke of Shiyang, but kept them close to him to watch them. In 404, however, a rebellion by the general Liu Yu quickly led to Huan Xuan's destruction and Emperor An's restoration. When, however, later that year Emperor An and Sima Dewen fell into the hands of Huan Xuan's nephew Huan Zhen (), Huan Zhen considered executing Emperor An to avenge Huan Xuan's young son Huan Sheng (), who was killed by the rebels. It took great pleading on Sima Dewen's part, explaining that neither he nor Emperor An had had anything to do with Huan Sheng's death, for Huan Zhen to spare Emperor An. In early 405, Huan Zhen was defeated, and Emperor An and Sima Dewen returned to the capital Jiankang, but by this point power was in Liu Yu's hands, albeit in a power-sharing agreement with a number of allies whom he had had to recruit in his campaign against Huan Xuan. As the years went by, Liu Yu gradually concentrated more and more power in his hands, destroying rivals including Liu Yi (), Zhuge Zhangmin (), and Sima Xiuzhi (), while greatly showing his strength in campaigns destroying rival states Southern Yan, Western Shu, and Later Qin. Sima Dewen continued to be largely ceremonially honored but actually powerless during this period. In 416, during Liu Yu's campaign against Later Qin, Sima Dewen asked to undertake a mission in Luoyang, recently captured from Later Qin, to try to restore the imperial tombs of the early Jin emperors, but it is not known what came of the mission. He returned to Jiankang in 418 after Liu Yu destroyed Later Qin. Late that year, Liu Yu, intending to seize the throne and believing a prophecy stating, \\"There will be two more emperors after Changming\\" (Changming, which meant \\"dawn,\\" was the courtesy name of Emperor Xiaowu), became intent on killing Emperor An and replacing him with Sima Dewen. However, because Sima Dewen continuously attended to his brother, assassins whom Liu Yu sent to poison Emperor An did not have the opportunity to do so. However, around the new year 419, Sima Dewen was ill and had to be at his own house, and Liu Yu's assassin Wang Shaozhi () took the opportunity to kill Emperor An. Liu Yu then declared Sima Dewen emperor, as Emperor Gong. Reign Emperor Gong's reign was a brief and powerless one. He created his wife Princess Chu empress in spring 419. He also promoted Liu Yu, then carrying the title Duke of Song, to the Prince of Song, which Liu Yu initially declined but accepted in fall 419. In spring 420, Liu Yu, then at Shouyang sent his assistant Fu Liang to Jiankang to pressure Emperor Gong to yield the throne. Emperor Gong responded by summoning Liu Yu back to the capital in summer 419, and Fu then offered him a draft of an abdication edict, requesting that he write it personally. Sima Dewen did so, and then left the palace and went to his old house while he was Prince of Langya. Three days later, Liu Yu took the throne and established Liu Song, ending Jin. After abdication Liu Yu created Sima Dewen the Prince of Lingling and built a palace for him near Jiankang. He had the general Liu Zunkao (), a distant cousin, lead a group of guards, ostensibly to protect the prince but instead to keep him under watch. Soon, Liu Yu, still believing Sima Dewen to be a threat, sent Sima Dewen's former attendant Zhang Wei () a bottle of poisoned wine, ordering him to poison Sima Dewen. Zhang, not wanting to carry out the order, drank the wine himself and died. Meanwhile, however, in order to prevent any likelihood that Sima Dewen would have a male heir, Liu Yu ordered Princess Chu's brothers Chu Xiuzhi () and Chu Danzhi () to poison any male children that Princess Chu or Sima Dewen's concubines would bear. Sima Dewen himself feared death greatly, and he and Princess Chu remained in the same house, cooking their own meals, with Princess Chu paying for the material herself. Assassins that Liu Yu sent initially could find no chance to kill the former emperor. In fall 421, Liu Yu sent Chu Danzhi and his brother Chu Shudu () to visit their sister. As Princess Chu came out to meet her brothers in a different house, soldiers sent by Liu Yu intruded into Sima Dewen's house and ordered him to take poison. He refused, stating that Buddhist doctrines prohibit suicide and that those who commit suicide could not be reborn as humans in their next lives. The assassins therefore used a blanket to cover his head and asphyxiated him. He was buried with imperial honors.

He is noted for possibly having named Block Island, Rhode Island, and establishing early trade with the Native Americans, and for the 1614 map of his last voyage on which many features of the mid- Atlantic region appear for the first time, and on which the term New Netherland is first applied to the region. He is credited with being the first European to enter Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River, and to determine that Manhattan and Long Island are islands.History of the United States of America: from the discovery of the Continent, George Bancroft, 1886, Volume 1 p 489 Early life Though spending much of his time at sea, Block called Amsterdam his home. There, on October 26, 1603, he married Neeltje Hendricks van Gelder, with whom he would have five children between 1607 and 1615. In 1606 they moved into a house called De Twee Bontecraijen (\\"The Two Hooded Crows\\") on Amsterdam's Oude Waal street, where they would live the rest of their lives.Tom Andersen This Fine Piece of Water: An Environmental History of Long Island Sound Yale University Press, 2002, pp. 37‚Äì40. In the 1590s, Block already was active in the shipping trade, transporting wood from Northern Europe to deforested Spain. He is for example mentioned delivering Norwegian timber in April 1596 in Bilbao. From there he headed for Ribadeo to buy goods for C√°diz. In April 1601, he was part of a convoy of ships leaving Amsterdam for the Dutch East Indies, at that time probably as far as the Moluccas, returning home in 1603. In the spring of 1604, after delivering goods in Liguria, Block sailed on to Cyprus buying cargo (rice, cotton, nuts, etc.) he hoped to sell in Venice. This trade fell through, and he headed home to Amsterdam. Passing Lisbon, he came upon a L√ºbeck-based ship returning from a trip to Brazil. He had written permission from Dutch authorities to capture enemy ships, which he put to use as a privateer, taking the ship and its load to Amsterdam. Though the ship and some of its goods were returned to its owners, Block made a lot of money, with which he probably bought the house on the Oude Waal. Block's new world expeditions=Early voyages (1611‚Äì1612) Following Hudson's contact with the Native Americans in the Hudson Valley in 1609, the Dutch merchants in Amsterdam had deemed the area worth exploring as a potential source of trade for beaver pelts,\\"1614 Adriaen\\", The Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Connecticut which were a lucrative market in Europe at the time. Cornelis Rijser successfully returned in the St. Pieter in 1611, and Block and his fellow captain Hendrick Christiaensen returned the next year in 1612, bringing back furs and two sons of a native sachem in the Fortuyn and another ship outfitted by a group of Lutheran merchants. It took about ten weeks to sail to New Netherland, sometimes longer. The prospect of successful fur trade prompted the States General, the governing body of the Dutch Republic, to issue a statement on March 27, 1614, stipulating that the discoverers of new countries, harbors, and passages would be given an exclusive patent good for four voyages undertaken within three years to the territories discovered if the applicant should submit a detailed report within 14 days after his return. The 1614 expedition Replica of the Onrust. Docked in Manhattan. In 1613, Block made a fourth voyage to the lower Hudson in the Tyger accompanied by several other ships especially equipped for trading. While moored along southern Manhattan, the Tyger was accidentally destroyed by fire. Over the winter, he and his men, with help from the Lenape (La-Na-Pae), built the ship 16-ton Onrust (Dutch for \\"Restless\\").Van Dusen, Albert \\"Connecticut\\" Random House, 1961, p.19 In this later ship, he explored the East River and was the first known European to navigate the Hellegat (now called Hell Gate) and to enter Long Island Sound. Traveling along the Sound, he entered the Housatonic River (which he named \\"River of Red Hills\\") and the Connecticut River, which he explored at least as far as the site of present-day Hartford, today's capital of the state of Connecticut some sixty miles up the river.\\"Adrien Block\\", The Connecticut River, University of Massachusetts Leaving Long Island Sound, he charted Block Island, which is named for him and Narragansett Bay, where he possibly named \\"Roode Eylandt\\" after the red (Dutch rood) color of its soil.\\"Dutch Place Names, The Atlantic World On Cape Cod, he rendezvoused with one of the other ships of the expedition and left the Onrust behind before returning to Europe. Life in the colony Block's exploration would lead to the eventual colonization of Connecticut. The life was hard, as it was settled in the winter as a result of the Connecticut River turning to ice. Block sailed upstream and established the Dutch base that later became Hartford. He is credited with naming Fishers Island (Vischer's Island) after a shipmate. Though it lies physically closer to Connecticut than New York, the island is a part of Long Island's Suffolk County. New Netherland company Upon returning, Block compiled a map of his voyage together with known information of the time. The Block map was the first to apply the name \\"New Netherland\\" to the area between English Virginia and French Canada, as well as the first to show Long Island as an island. On October 11, 1614, Block, Christiaensen, and a group of twelve other merchants presented to the States General a petition to receive exclusive trading privileges for the area. Their company, the newly formed New Netherland Company, was granted exclusive rights for three years to trade between the 40th parallel north and the 45th parallel north. After his return to Amsterdam in July 1614, he would not return to the New World again. In 1615, Block was Commissary-General of three men-of-war and eleven whaleships sent to Spitsbergen by the Noordsche Compagnie. He remained sailing until his death in 1627. He was buried in Amsterdam's Oude Kerk in a grave next to his wife. Legacy A multimillion-dollar redevelopment on the Connecticut River in Hartford, Connecticut is named \\"Adriaen's Landing\\" after Block. Adriaen Block has a middle school in Flushing, Queens (NYC) named after him.

For her graduate studies, Dalby studied and performed fieldwork in Japan of the geisha community which she wrote about in her Ph.D. dissertation. Since that time, she has written five books. Her first book, Geisha, was based on her early research. The next book, Kimono is about traditional Japanese clothing and the history of the kimono. She followed that with a fictional account of the Heian era noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu, titled The Tale of Murasaki. In 2007 she wrote a memoir, East Wind Melts the Ice, which was followed two years later by a second work of fiction, Hidden Buddhas. Dalby is considered an expert in the study of the Japanese geisha community and has acted as consultant to novelist Arthur Golden and filmmaker Rob Marshall for the novel Memoirs of a Geisha and the film of the same name.  Background  As a high school student, Dalby visited Japan in a student exchange program; there she learned to play the shamisen. In 1975, she returned to Japan for a year to research the geisha community, as part of her anthropology fieldwork. Dalby's research, done as part of her Ph.D studies at Stanford University, was presented in her dissertation, and became the basis for her first book, Geisha, about the culture of the geisha community. Her study, which included interviews with more than 100 geisha, was considered to be excellent and received praise from scholars at the time of publication, although some retrospective scholarship is more critical.Bardsley, 314, 318 During her Ph.D studies about the geisha community, conducted in Pontoch≈ç, she was invited to join a house in Kyoto where she was allowed to attend banquets under the name Ichigiku‚Äîin part because she was fluent in Japanese and skilled with the shamisen. She performed at ozashiki without charging money, and, from the experience, formed friendships and relationships with geisha in the district.Nimura, Janice. \\"Lady-in-Waiting\\". January 7, 2001.

Because of her expertise in the subject, Arthur Golden asked for her to act as a consultant when he wrote Memoirs of a Geisha, and later Rob Marshall, director of the 2005 film adaptation starring Zhang Ziyi, consulted with her.Bardsley, 314\\"Ken Watanabe to Star in Memoirs of A Geisha\\" . Monsters and critics.com. August 20, 2004. Retrieved July 13, 2011. In the book she writes about the life of geisha and how the world is based on tightly knit and hierarchical society of women. She presents the history of the geisha community and explores the context in which geisha traditionally were in the forefront of fashion, which for the modern geisha is no longer true.Bardsley, 315 kimono in this 17th-century illustration by Tosa Mitsuoki Kimono Geisha was followed by a book about kimono, called Kimono: Fashioning Culture. In an interview with Salon.com, she explains that in 11th-century Japanese court literature, women authors such as Murasaki Shikibu wrote lengthy descriptions of kimono in their work. Dalby believes, that from an anthropological point of view, the dress of the period must be taken seriously and she strives to understand the symbolism represented in the layering of clothing, often described in texts such as Murasaki's The Tale of Genji. In the book Dalby presents essays about the social symbolism of the kimono, going back to the 12th century when an Empress had to choose a multi-layered kimono based on mood, season, and social event, without making a mistake in color or style, moving all to the present with an essay about modern Japanese women who wear kimono.Becker, Alida. \\"Layers of Meaning\\". New York Times Book Review. (March 1994).  The Tale of Murasaki  Heian era court life depicted in a 19th-century ukiyo-e illustration of The Tale of Genji by Hiroshige Dalby's The Tale of Murasaki, a fictional biography of Murasaki Shikibu, an 11th- century court poet, whose work The Tale of Genji is considered a classic, was published in 2000. Dalby says that she decided to write a fictional account of Murasaki's life because she \\"couldn't contribute anything scholarly\\". Fascinated by the 11th-century Heian period court culture, she wove much of it into the book: writing about the clothing the women wore; the love affairs they had; the manner in which poetry was frequently exchanged; and that women lived in seclusion, behind screens, with their faces often unseen by lovers. Dalby explains that the geisha society did not develop until at least 500 years later, and that a court lady-in-waiting such as Murasaki would not have had the temperament to be a geisha because Murasaki was reserved, whereas geisha are expected to be outgoing. East Wind Melts the Ice She then wrote a memoir, East Wind Melts the Ice: A Memoir through the Seasons, published in 2007. In the book, she follows the a system of time derived in ancient China in which a year is divided into 72 five-day periods. She claims the concept has affected her sense of time. The memoir consists of 72 vignettes, with lower case titles, such as \\"chrysanthemums are tinged yellow\\". According to The New York Times Book Review, Dalby sees herself as eccentric, reflected in her writing, where she presents unusual yet interesting material. In the book, she weaves together experiences from Japan, China and northern California, and \\"presents a wealth of information\\". Dalby received praise from Booklist for the manner in which she uses stream-of-consciousness to create a work in which the eastern concept of time is contrasted with the western; her ability to see with an anthropologist's eye and yet to bring an imaginative and creative view to this work; and in particular to bring together the various places she has lived, from Kyoto, where she was the first western woman to become a geisha in the 1970s, to northern California where she currently lives.Haggas, Carol. \\"East Wind Melts the Ice: A Memoir through the Seasons\\". (February 1, 2007). Booklist. Volume 103.  Hidden Buddhas  Dalby's second novel, Hidden Buddhas: A Novel of Karma and Chaos, was published in 2009, in which she returns to writing fiction. In this book, set in modern-day Japan, Paris, and California, she writes a story set against the backdrop of the concept of hibutsu (secret Buddha statues) in Japanese Buddhist temples.\\"Hidden Buddhas\\" Stonebridge Press.

Before the Territory was organized Proposed boundaries for the earlier federal State of New Mexico, 1850 In 1846, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the U.S. provisional government of New Mexico was established. Territorial boundaries were somewhat ambiguous. After the Mexican Republic formally ceded the region to the United States in 1848, this temporary wartime/military government persisted until September 9, 1850. Earlier in the year 1850, a bid for New Mexico statehood was underway under a proposed state constitution prohibiting slavery. The request was approved at the same time that the Utah Territory was created to the north. The proposed state boundaries were to extend as far east as the 100th meridian West and as far north as the Arkansas River, thus encompassing the present-day Texas and Oklahoma panhandles and parts of present-day Kansas, Colorado, Utah, and Arizona, as well as most of present-day New Mexico. Texas raised great opposition to this plan, as it claimed much of the same territory, although it did not control these lands. In addition, slaveholders worried about not being able to expand slavery to the west of their current slave states. Compromise of 1850 and disputes over slavery New Mexico Territory, 1852 The Gadsden Purchase, 1853 left left left The Compromise of 1850 put an end to the push for immediate New Mexico statehood. Approved by the United States Congress in September 1850, the legislation provided for the establishment of New Mexico Territory and Utah Territory. It also firmly established the disputed western boundary of Texas. The status of slavery during the territorial period provoked considerable debate. The granting of statehood was up to a Congress sharply divided on the slavery issue. Some (including Stephen A. Douglas) maintained that the territory could not restrict slavery, as under the earlier Missouri Compromise, while others (including Abraham Lincoln) insisted that older Mexican Republic legal traditions of the territory, which abolished black, but not Indian, slavery in 1834, took precedence and should be continued. Regardless of its official status, slavery was rare in antebellum New Mexico. Black slaves never numbered more than about a dozen.New Mexico Territory Slave Code (1859‚Äì1867)  The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed As one of the final attempts at compromise to avoid the Civil War, in December 1860, a U.S. House of Representatives committee proposed to admit New Mexico as a slave state immediately. Although the measure was approved by the committee on December 29, 1860, Southern representatives did not take up this offer, as many of them had already left Congress due to imminent declarations of secession by their states. On February 24, 1863, during the Civil War, Congress passed the \\"Arizona Organic Act\\", which split off the western portion of the then 12-year-old New Mexico Territory as the new Arizona Territory, and abolished slavery in the new Territory. As in New Mexico, slavery was already extremely limited, due to earlier Mexican traditions, laws, and patterns of settlement. The northwestern corner of New Mexico Territory was included in Arizona Territory until it was added to the southernmost part of the newly admitted State of Nevada in 1864. Eventually, Arizona Territory was organized as the State of Arizona. Territorial evolution The Purchase treaty defines the new border as \\"up the middle of that river (the Rio Grande) to the point where the parallel of 31¬∞ 47' north latitude crosses the same ; thence due west one hundred miles; thence south to the parallel of 31¬∞ 20' north latitude; thence along the said parallel of 31¬∞ 20' to the 111th meridian of longitude west of Greenwich ; thence in a straight line to a point on the Colorado River twenty English miles below the junction of the Gila and Colorado rivers; thence up the middle of the said river Colorado until it intersects the present line between the United States and Mexico.\\" The new border included a few miles of the Colorado River at the western end; the remaining land portion consisted of line segments between points, including at the Colorado River, west of Nogales at , near AZ-NM-Mexico tripoint at , the eastern corners of NM southern bootheel (Hidalgo County) at , and the west bank of Rio Grande at . The boundaries of the New Mexico Territory at the time of establishment (September 9, 1850) contained most of the present-day State of New Mexico, more than half of the present-day State of Arizona, and portions of the present-day states of Colorado and Nevada. Although this area was smaller than what had been included in the failed statehood proposal of early 1850, the boundary disputes with Texas had been dispelled by the Compromise of 1850. The Gadsden Purchase was acquired by the United States from Mexico in 1853/1854 (known as the \\"Venta de La Mesilla\\" or the \\"Sale of La Mesilla\\"), arranged by the then-American ambassador to Mexico, James Gadsden. This added today's southern strip of Arizona and a smaller area in today's southwestern New Mexico to the New Mexico Territory, bringing its land area to the maximum size achieved in its history as an organized territory. The land of provided a more easily constructed route for a future southern transcontinental railroad line (second of the routes) for the future Southern Pacific Railroad, constructed later in 1881/1883. The Colorado Territory was established by the \\"Colorado Organic Act\\" on February 28, 1861, with the same boundaries that would ultimately constitute the State of Colorado. This Act removed the Colorado lands from the New Mexico Territory. The creation of the Union Arizona Territory (two years after the ill-fated Confederate Arizona Territory) by the \\"Arizona Organic Act\\" on February 24, 1863, removed all the land west of the 109th meridian from the New Mexico Territory, i.e. the entire present-day State of Arizona plus the land that would become the southern part of the State of Nevada in 1864.New York Times ‚Äì The New Territory of Arizona This Act left the New Mexico Territory with boundaries identical to the eventual State of New Mexico for a half-century until admitted to the Union in 1912 as the 47th state (followed just under six weeks later by the Arizona Territory/State of Arizona, which became the 48th state, finally filling out the coast-to-coast continental expanse of the United States). American Civil War As the route to California, New Mexico Territory was disputed territory during the American Civil War. Settlers in the southern part of the Territory willingly joined the Confederate States in 1861 as the newly organized Confederate Territory of Arizona, with a representative delegate to the Confederate Congress in the capital of Richmond. This territory consisted of the southern half of the earlier Federal New Mexico Territory of 1851 and was in contrast to the later Federal Arizona Territory established by the Union in 1863, which was the western half split off from the original U.S. New Mexico Territory. The short-lived Confederate Arizona Territory was the first American territorial entity to be called \\"Arizona\\". The Battle of Glorieta Pass in May 1862, following the retreat of Texan Confederate forces back south to El Paso, placed the area of the Rio Grande valley and eastern New Mexico Territory with the capital of Santa Fe under the control of the Federals with their Union Army.National Park Service ‚Äì The Battle of Glorieta However, the government and leadership of Confederate Arizona persisted until the end of the Civil War in June 1865 with the surrender of the Trans-Mississippi Department, living in exile in El Paso, Texas with its delegate still in Richmond.

(; ) was a Jewish section of the Soviet Communist Party. These sections were established in fall of 1918 with consent of Vladimir Lenin to carry communist revolution to the Jewish masses. Pipes, Richard, Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime, New York: Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, , page 363 The Yevsektsiya published a Yiddish periodical, Emes.

The revolution did not reach the Jewish street. Everything remained as before\\".Gilboa, Jehoshua A. A Language Silenced: The Suppression of Hebrew Literature and Culture in the Soviet Union. Rutherford [N.J.]: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1982. p. 282 History The Yevsektsiya remained fairly isolated from both the Jewish intelligentsia and working class. The sections were staffed mostly by Jewish ex-members of the Bund, which eventually joined the Soviet Communist Party as the Kombund in 1921,, and the United Jewish Socialist Workers Party. The Yevsektsiya deemed Russian Zionist organisations to be counter-revolutionary, and agitated for them to be shut down. Delegates to a Zionist congress in March 1919 complained at administrative harassment of their activities - not from government agencies, but from Jewish communists. At the Yevsektsiya's second conference in July 1919, it demanded that the Zionist organizations be dissolved. After an appeal from the Zionists, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee issued a decree in that the Zionist organisation was not counter-revolutionary and its activities should not be disrupted. The campaign continued, however. In 1920, the first All-Russian Zionist Congress was disrupted by members of the Cheka and a female representative of the Yevsektsiya. At its third conference in July 1921, the Yevsektsiya demanded the \\"total liquidation\\" of Zionism. According to Richard Pipes, \\"in time, every Jewish cultural and social organization came under assault\\". Acting together with local Soviet authorities, Evsektsii organized seizures of synagogues in Gomel, Minsk and Kharkov, which were subsequently converted to clubs or Communist centers. They particularly fought against the sixth Chabad Rebbe Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn who urged his followers to resist to their last drop of blood attempts to uproot religion which went against Communist ideology, causing many of them to be arrested and sometimes killed, eventually causing the arrest of the Rebbe himself in 1927. The Yevsektsiya attempted to use its influence to cut off state funds to Habima Theatre, branding it counter-revolutionary. The theatre left Russia to go on tour in 1926, before settling in Mandatory Palestine in 1928 to become Israel's national theatre.Politzer, Heinz (August 1948). \\"Habimah in New York: A Great Theater Enters a New Period\\". Commentary Magazine. Retrieved 2017-03-06. The Yevsektsii were disbanded as no longer needed in 1929. Many leading members were murdered during the Great Purge of the late 1930s, including Chairman Dimanstein. Executed in 1938, he was posthumously rehabilitated in 1955, two years after the death of Joseph Stalin.

Specifically, oligochaetes comprise the terrestrial megadrile earthworms (some of which are semiaquatic or fully aquatic), and freshwater or semiterrestrial microdrile forms, including the tubificids, pot worms and ice worms (Enchytraeidae), blackworms (Lumbriculidae) and several interstitial marine worms. With around 10,000 known species, the Oligochaeta make up about half of the phylum Annelida. These worms usually have few setae (chaetae) or \\"bristles\\" on their outer body surfaces, and lack parapodia, unlike polychaeta. Diversity Oligochaetes are well-segmented worms and most have a spacious body cavity (coelom) used as a hydroskeleton. They range in length from less than up to in the 'giant' species such as the giant Gippsland earthworm (Megascolides australis) and the Mekong worm (Amynthas mekongianus).Blakemore, Robert J., Csaba Csuzdi, Masamichi T. Ito, Nobuhiro Kaneko, Maurizio G. Paoletti, Sergei E. Spiridonov, Tomoko Uchida & Beverley D. Van Praagh (2007). Megascolex (Promegascolex) mekongianus Cognetti, 1922: its extent, ecology and allocation to Amynthas (Oligochaeta: Megascolecidae). Opuscula Zoologica. 36: 19-30 (Aug. 2007) . Terrestrial oligochaetes are commonly known as earthworms and burrow into the soil. The four main families with large numbers of species are Glossoscolecidae, Lumbricidae, Megascolecidae and Moniligastridae. Earthworms are found in all parts of the world except for deserts. They have a requirement for moist surroundings and the larger species create burrows that may go down several metres (yards) while young individuals and smaller species are restricted to the top few centimetres of soil. The largest numbers are found in humus-rich soils and acid soils. A few species are found in trees, among damp moss and in the debris that accumulates in leaf axils and crevices; some others make their homes in the rosettes of bromeliads. The majority of aquatic oligochaetes are small, slender worms, whose organs can be seen through the transparent body wall. They burrow into the sediment or live among the vegetation mostly in shallow, freshwater environments. Some are transitional between terrestrial and aquatic habitats, inhabiting swamps, mud or the borders of water bodies. About two hundred species are marine, mostly in the families Enchytraeidae and Naididae; these are found largely in the tidal and shallow subtidal zones, but a few are found at abyssal depths. Anatomy The first segment, or prostomium, of oligochaetes is usually a smooth lobe or cone without sensory organs, although it is sometimes extended to form a tentacle. The remaining segments have no appendages, but they do have a small number of bristles, or chaetae. These tend to be longer in aquatic forms than in the burrowing earthworms, and can have a variety of shapes. Each segment has four bundles of chaetae, with two on the underside, and the others on the sides. The bundles can contain one to 25 chaetae, and include muscles to pull them in and out of the body. This enables the worm to gain a grip on the soil or mud as it burrows into the substrate. When burrowing, the body moves peristaltically, alternately contracting and stretching to push itself forward. A number of segments in the forward part of the body are modified by the presence of numerous secretory glands. Together, they form the clitellum, which is important in reproduction. Internal anatomy Most oligochaetes are detritus feeders, although some genera are predaceous, such as Agriodrilus and Phagodrilus. The digestive tract is essentially a tube running the length of the body, but has a powerful muscular pharynx immediately behind the mouth cavity. In many species, the pharynx simply helps the worm suck in food, but in many aquatic species, it can be turned inside out and placed over food like a suction cup before being pulled back in. The remainder of the digestive tract may include a crop for storage of food, and a gizzard for grinding it up, although these are not present in all species. The oesophagus includes \\"calciferous glands\\" that maintain calcium balance by excreting indigestible calcium carbonate into the gut. A number of yellowish chloragogen cells surround the intestine and the dorsal blood vessel, forming a tissue that functions in a similar fashion to the vertebrate liver. Some of these cells also float freely in the body cavity, where they are referred to as \\"eleocytes\\". Most oligochaetes have no gills or similar structures, and simply breathe through their moist skin. The few exceptions generally have simple, filamentous gills. Excretion is through small ducts known as metanephridia. Terrestrial oligochaetes secrete urea, but the aquatic forms typically secrete ammonia, which dissolves rapidly into the water. The vascular system consists of two main vessels connected by lateral vessels in each segment. Blood is carried forward in the dorsal vessel (in the upper part of the body) and back through the ventral vessel (underneath), before passing into a sinus surrounding the intestine. Some of the smaller vessels are muscular, effectively forming hearts; from one to five pairs of such hearts is typical. The blood of oligochaetes contains haemoglobin in all but the smallest of species, which have no need of respiratory pigments. The nervous system consists of two ventral nerve cords, which are usually fused into a single structure, and three or four pairs of smaller nerves per body segment. Only a few aquatic oligochaetes have eyes, and even then they are only simply ocelli. Nonetheless, their skin has several individual photoreceptors, allowing the worm to sense the presence of light, and burrow away from it. Oligochaetes can taste their surroundings using chemoreceptors located in tubercles across their body, and their skin is also supplied with numerous free nerve endings that presumably contribute to their sense of touch. Distribution and habitat Oligochaetes occur in every continent in the world occupying terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. Of the 1700 known aquatic species, about 600 are marine and 100 inhabit groundwater. Aquatic oligochaetes occur in most groups, with the Naididae being the most speciose. Locomotion Movement and burrowing of earthworms is performed by peristalsis, with the alternation of contraction and relaxation of the circular and longitudinal muscles. To move forward, the anterior portion of the worm is extended forward by the contraction of the circular muscles, while the portion just behind this is made shorter and fatter by the contraction of longitudinal muscles. Next the anterior circular muscles relax, and a wave of circular contraction moves backwards along the worm. At the same time, the cheatae expand to grip the ground as the body shortens and are retracted as it lengthens. The steps are typically long and the worm moves at the rate of seven to ten steps per minute. The worm is able to reverse its direction of travel with the tail leading. Aquatic species use a similar means of locomotion to work their way through sediment and massed vegetation, but the tiny Aeolosomatids swim by means of the cilia on their prostomia. Burrowing is performed by forcing the front end of the worm into a crevice and widening the gap by body expansion. Large quantities of soil are swallowed in the process. This is mixed with mucus as it passes through the gut, being used to plaster the tunnel walls, forming a lining. Excess material is extruded on the ground surface, forming a faecal casting. The burrow may have two entrances and several vertical and horizontal tunnels. Reproduction Whereas in general, polychaetes are marine and have separate sexes, external sperm transfer and external fertilisation, oligochaetes live on land or in fresh water, are hermaphrodites, have no external sperm transfer and fertilisation takes place in the clitellum or cocoon. However there are exceptions to this, with some polychaetes inhabiting non-marine environments and a few species of oligochaetes being marine. Development of the offspring also differs between the two subclasses. The eggs of polychaetes are deposited in the sea where they develop into trochophore larvae that disperse as part of the plankton, while the yolky eggs of oligochaetes do not have a larval stage and develop directly into juvenile worms in the cocoon. Reproduction among oligochaetes is mainly by sexual means but clonal reproduction is common in some genera, especially among aquatic species. Members of the Naididae reproduce asexually, primarily by paratomy, in which the body breaks into two pieces after the \\"pregeneration\\" of certain anterior structures by the posterior portion. Other species undergo fragmentation, in which the worm breaks into several pieces, each of which develops into a new worm. Parthenogenesis also occurs in some species. Evolution and taxonomy With their soft bodies, earthworms do not fossilize well, though they may form trace fossils. The name Protoscolex was given to a genus of segmented worms without bristles found in the Upper Ordovician of Kentucky, United States. Another species placed in the same genus was found in Herefordshire, England, but it is unclear whether these worms are in fact oligochaetes. Stephenson postulated in 1930 that the common ancestor of oligochaetes came from the primitive aquatic family Lumbriculidae. The more advanced families such as Glossoscolecidae, Hormogastridae, Lumbricidae and Microchaetidae may have evolved later than the other families. Because of its ability to colonise new areas and become dominant, the Lumbricidae has followed humans round the world and displaced many native species of earthworm. An early but now outdated classification system was to divide the oligochaetes into \\"Megadrili\\", the larger terrestrial species, and \\"Microdili\\", the smaller, mostly aquatic ones.

Traditional performances Nashid performing at the Zero Degree Atoll reunion show \\"Sound of a Nation\\" at Alimas Carnival in Male'. The most widely known form of indigenous music is called boduberu. It is also the most popular, especially in the Northern Atolls. It is said to have appeared in the Maldives in about the 11th century, and that it may have East African origins. It is a dance music, performed by about fifteen people, including a lead singer and three percussionists, as well as a bell and a small stick of bamboo with horizontal grooves called an onugandu. Boduberu songs begin with a slow beat, which eventually enters a frenetic crescendo accompanied by frenetic dancing. Lyrics can be about any number of subjects, and often include vocables (meaningless syllables). Thaara music is performed by about 22 people seated in two rows opposite each other. It is performed only by men, and is somewhat religious in nature. Like boduberu, thaara songs begin slowly and come to a peak. Thaara is said to have arrived with Arabs who came from the Persian Gulf in the middle of the 17th century. Gaa odi lava is a special type of song performed after the completion of manual labor. It was said to have been invented during the reign of Sultan Mohamed Imadudeen I (1620‚Äì1648), for the workers who built defenses for the city of Mal√©. In the early 20th century, Sultan Muhammad Shamsuddeen III ruled the Maldives and the youth developed a form of music called langiri, using thaara as the major source and modifying its performance. The bolimalaafath neshun is a dance performed by women on special occasions or when giving gifts to the sultan. These gifts, most often shells, are kept in an intricately decorated box or vase called the kurandi malaafath. About twenty-four women typically participate, in small groups of two to six. They march towards the sultan singing songs of patriotism or loyalty. Since becoming a republic in 1968, this dance is no longer performed for any sultan, since one no longer exists. Another women's dance is called maafathi neshun, which is similar to langiri. It is performed by women dancing in two rows of ten each, carrying a semi-circular string with fake flowers attached. A dance called fathigandu jehun is performed by either one person or a group of men, using two pieces of short bamboo sticks to accompany the dancers and a drummer, who also sings. These songs are typically epics, most famously one called Burunee Raivaru. Bandiyaa jehun is perhaps related to the Indian pot dance, and is performed by women. Dancers mark the beat with a metal water pot, while wearing metal rings. Modern groups perform either standing or sitting, and have added drums and harmonicas. Kulhudhuffushi (on Haa Dhaalu Atoll) is known for kadhaamaali, which is performed with numerous drums and a kadhaa, which is made of a copper plate and rod. About thirty men take part, dressed in costumes of evil spirits (maali). Kadhaamaali is associated with a traditional walk around the island late at night by the elders, in order to ward of maali. This walk lasted for three days, followed by music and dancing. Popular songs and dances Electric bulbul tarang playing Maldivians feel some affinity to Northern India through their language, which is related to the languages of North India. Most older generation or traditional Maldivians like to watch Hindi movies from the 1960s or 70s, and like to listen to the songs of those movies. The reason is that out of a similar language, similar rhythms and cadences develop. In fact, it is very easy for Maldivians to fit local lyrics to a Hindi tune because of this cultural closeness. For example, the Hindi words Ek din (\\"one day\\") are changed to E kudin (those kids) in Dhivehi, and in this manner a new local song develops. Before cable TV, the most popular radio programmes from the Voice of Maldives (VOM) were those broadcasting older Hindi songs, like Vakivumuge kurin (\\"Before the breakup\\"). On rural islands, Hindi songs are still the most popular songs, especially the older ones from Mohammed Rafi, Mukesh, Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhonsle, Hemant Kumar and Kishore Kumar. Therefore, most popular Maldivian songs are based in (or influenced by) Hindi songs. Similarly, the few popular local dances are based on North Indian dances, especially Kathak. The favorite musical instrument of Maldivians, besides the drum, is the bulbul tarang, a kind of horizontal accordion. This instrument is also used to accompany devotional songs, like Maadhaha. Singers like Naifaru Dohokko became famous through songs with bulbul music in the background. The first bulbuls were brought from Calcutta in the early 19th century. Influences from North Indian music and dances date back to that time. They didn't begin broadcasting Hindi songs by radio until the 1960s and 70s. There are also female singers producing traditional songs; among them, the most popular were Fareeda Hasan and Jƒìmuge Donkamanaa, whose songs continue to be cherished by Maldivians, although both women have died. Religious songs Formerly in the islands of Maldives, there was a festival called Maul≈´du, where religious songs were sung by groups of males within a pavilion (haruge) specially built for the occasion. When a Maul≈´d was arranged, local islanders had to build a large, open-sided pavilion with wooden poles. They would thatch it with coconut-palm fronds, and decorate it with oil lamps and special patchwork draperies. The day of the event, special food would be prepared, and beautifully displayed for the benefit of the Maul≈´d singers and a great number of guests coming from their rival island (or village), in their best dresses, on festively decorated boats. Here the host islanders had to prove themselves hospitable in the preparations and accommodation, in order to be able to compare favorably when it was their own turn to receive hospitality in the rival island on a similar occasion. Another name for religious songs is madhaha. Modern music Unoosha, Maldivian singer and songwriter. Ahmed Faseeh Performing live in Hulhumale, 2011 Hussain Shihab, formerly a musician and now the minister of state for arts, wrote a song to a foreign tune. This song was named hiy Adhu Roneeyey Nudhashey, which he admitted in a program broadcast on the anniversary of Television Maldives (TVM). Western music is more popular in the capital, as in any global city. However, popular music has shifted from plagiarizing to more original concepts. The Dhivehi band Zero Degree Atoll released an album named Dhoni (\\"Traditional Maldivian Boat\\"). This album had roots in folk and ancient arts such as Raivaru, a type of traditional poetry, where letters are swapped to be sung in a certain melody. The album was a huge success, followed by its remake with few new songs in 1997, the album titled Island Pulse recorded in France. The band had a huge impact on the local population, which unofficially claimed it as the saviors of traditional Dhivehi musical art and the pioneers of modern Dhivehi music. Another famous band is the Trio Band. Trio Band first performance on Dhanberu Live show known by Chaaley song, raarukuga and Ey manjey. Trio band has its own unique style as a young band. Lately they become boduberu style. Trio Band Lead Vocal is Moosa Shifau. Many other bands and local performers have kept up tradition. It is believed that the state sponsored radio and TV grew more in favor of foreign music, when most quintessential Dhivehi musicians started including political content in their lyrics. Such lyricists include Easa of Sea Child, who was jailed for drug related issues. Although Easa is not regarded professionally, many of his songs have been stolen and sung. While serving time at Maafushi, he is said to have written more than a hundred songs. Songs such as Jamalegge Soora (\\"face of a camel\\"), Filavalhu (\\"lesson\\"), Fangivinun (a collaboration of folk and an original Raivaru), Insaana (\\"the Human\\") and Govaali Adu are very prominent among musicians, and in the underground music scene.

They are written in Anglo-Norman and were probably composed in the late 12th century. The short, narrative poems generally focus on glorifying the concept of courtly love by the adventures of their main characters. Marie's lais are thought to form the basis for what would eventually become the genre known as the Breton lais. Despite her stature in Anglo-Norman literature and medieval French literature generally, little is known of Marie herself, but it is thought that she was born in France and wrote in England. Literary character Marie de France's lais, told in octosyllables or eight-syllable verse, are notable for their celebration of love, individuality of character, and vividness of description, hallmarks of the emerging literature of the times. Five different manuscripts contain one or more of the lais, but only one, Harley 978, a 13th-century manuscript housed in the British Library, preserves all twelve. It has been suggested that if the author had indeed arranged the Lais as presented in Harley 978, she may have chosen this overall structure to contrast the positive and negative actions that can result from love.Ferrante, Joan M. \\"A New History of French Literature,\\" p. 53, Edited by Denis Hollier. Harvard University Press, 1994 In this manuscript, the odd lais (\\"Guigemar\\", \\"Le Fresne\\", etc.) praise the characters who express love for other people. By comparison, the even lais, such as \\"Equitan\\", \\"Bisclavret\\" and so on, warn how love that is limited to oneself can lead to misfortune. The Harley 978 manuscript also includes a 56-line prologue in which Marie describes the impetus for her composition of the lais. In the prologue, Marie writes that she was inspired by the example of the ancient Greeks and Romans to create something that would be both entertaining and morally instructive. She also states her desire to preserve for posterity the tales that she has heard. Two of Marie's lais, \\"Lanval,\\" a very popular work that was adapted several times over the years (including the Middle English Sir Launfal) and \\"Chevrefoil\\" (\\"The Honeysuckle\\"), a short composition about Tristan and Iseult, mention King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. Marie's lais were precursors to later works on the subject, and she was probably a contemporary of Chr√©tien de Troyes, another writer of Arthurian tales. Influence Marie's lais were among the first works translated into Old Norse, in which they (and a number of other lais) are known as the Strengleikar.Strengleikar: An Old Norse Translation of Twenty-one Old French Lais, ed. and trans. by Robert Cook and Mattias Tveitane, Norr√∏ne tekster, 3 (Oslo: Norsk historisk kjeldeskrift- institutt, 1979).

The space enclosed may be covered or open. In St. Peter's Square in Rome, Bernini's great colonnade encloses a vast open elliptical space.

In the decades that followed the war, he was a successful merchant in Charleston, South Carolina, and in Philadelphia. He was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives in 1800 and was offered the office of Secretary of the Navy in 1801, but declined and remained in Congress to the end of his term in 1803. With the War of 1812 raging, Jones became Secretary of the Navy in January 1813. His policies contributed greatly to American success on the Great Lakes and to a strategy of coastal defense and commerce raiding on the high seas. In late 1814, near the end of his term, he made recommendations on the reorganization of the Navy Department. These led to the establishment of the Board of Commissioners system which operated from 1815 until 1842.

It consists of a hollow tube with a threaded cap at the end. The tube is inserted into the urethra, and a stem is inserted through a Prince Albert piercing and into another threaded hole on the side of the tube. The general shape is similar to a police nightstick. The little side stem holds the tube in place. The threaded cap, often just a ball, can be removed so the wearer can urinate through the hollow tube without having to remove the jewelry (from the Prince Albert piercing). Most prince's wands are held in place by a Prince Albert (PA) piercing, but any urethral piercing can be used, and some wands require no piercing. Prince's wands are somewhat uncommon, expensive to buy and relatively difficult to manufacture or procure. They are most popular among men who enjoy urethral play. Prince's wands require precision measurements of the penis and urethra both flaccid and erect, in addition to the original Prince Albert piercing. An example of an uncircumcised penis wearing a large \\"door-knocker\\" Prince's Wand Types of prince's wands There are three basic types of prince's wands. The most common, or standard type is the basic \\"policeman's nightstick\\". Ringed wands have one or more external rings that are attached to the bead on the outside stem of the wand that passes through the PA piercing, and encircle the penis. Finally, pinless wands do not require a PA piercing to wear, as they have no stem to insert through a piercing. Rarer features include more than one stem, e.g. two opposite ones for an ampallang or an apadravya or multiple stems for more than one piercing, and various attachments to the external beads.

(Milne 2007). Regular temperament is any tempered system of musical tuning such that each frequency ratio is obtainable as a product of powers of a finite number of generators, or generating frequency ratios. For instance, in 12-TET, the system of music most commonly used in the Western world, the generator is a tempered fifth (700 cents), which is the basis behind the circle of fifths. When only two generators are needed, with one of them the octave, this is called \\"linear temperament\\". The best-known example of a linear temperaments is meantone temperament, where the generating intervals are usually given in terms of a slightly flattened fifth and the octave. Other linear temperaments include the schismatic temperament of Hermann von Helmholtz and miracle temperament.  Mathematical description  If the generators are all of the prime numbers up to a given prime p, we have what is called p-limit just intonation. Sometimes some irrational number close to one of these primes is substituted (an example of tempering) to favour other primes, as in twelve tone equal temperament where 3 is tempered to 2 to favour 2, or in quarter-comma meantone where 3 is tempered to 2 to favor 2 and 5. In mathematical terminology, the products of these generators define a free abelian group. The number of independent generators is the rank of an abelian group. The rank-one tuning systems are equal temperaments, all of which can be spanned with only a single generator. A rank-two temperament has two generators. Hence, meantone is a rank-2 temperament. In studying regular temperaments, it can be useful to regard the temperament as having a map from p-limit just intonation (for some prime p) to the set of tempered intervals. To properly classify a temperament's dimensionality one must determine how many of the given generators are independent, because its description may contain redundancies. Another way of considering this problem is that the rank of a temperament should be the rank of its image under this map. For instance, a harpsichord tuner it might think of quarter-comma meantone tuning as having three generators‚Äîthe octave, the just major third (5:4) and the quarter-comma tempered fifth‚Äîbut because four consecutive tempered fifths produces a just major third, the major third is redundant, reducing it to a rank-two temperament. Other methods of linear and multilinear algebra can be applied to the map. For instance, a map's kernel (otherwise known as \\"nullspace\\") consists of p-limit intervals called commas, which are a property useful in describing temperaments.  External links  * * A.

After failure of the second fourth-stage burn, the probe assembly re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, breaking up over a 200-mile long portion of the Pacific Ocean, Chile, and Bolivia. The Mars 96 spacecraft was based on the Phobos probes launched to Mars in 1988. They were of a new design at the time and both ultimately failed. For the Mars 96 mission the designers believed they had corrected the flaws of the Phobos probes, but the value of their improvements was never demonstrated due to the destruction of the probe during the launch phase. It was, however, a very ambitious mission and the heaviest interplanetary probe launched up to that time. The mission included an orbiter, surface stations and surface penetrators. The mission included a large complement of instruments provided by India, France, Germany, other European countries and the United States. Similar instruments have since been flown on Mars Express, launched in 2003. Its project scientist was Alexander Zakharov.  Scientific goals  Mars 96 was intended to solve several problems concerning our understanding of Mars. The scientific goal of the mission was to analyze the planet's evolutionary history of its surface, atmosphere, and inner structure. Other studies during cruise, such as astrophysical studies were to be made. They can be broken down into several categories.  Martian surface  Studies of the Martian surface were to include a global topographical survey, mineralogical mapping, soil composition, and studies of the cryolithozone and its deep structure.  Atmosphere  Studies of the atmosphere were to include studies of the climate, abundance of certain elements, ions, and chemicals such as water, carbon dioxide, ozone, and others, general global monitoring, pressure variations over time, and characterization of aerosols.  Inner structure  Studies of planet structure were to find the thickness of the crust, study the Martian magnetic field, study of thermal flux, search for the possibility of active volcanoes, and study seismic activity.  Plasma studies  Plasma studies were to study the strength and orientation of the magnetic field, study of ions and energy composition of plasma during interplanetary cruise and near Mars, and the study of the magnetosphere and its boundaries.  Astrophysical studies  Astrophysical studies were to take place during interplanetary cruise. They included studies of cosmic gamma-bursts and the study of oscillations of the Sun and other stars.  Spacecraft design  Model of the Mars 96 Orbiter  Orbiter  The Mars 96 orbiter was a 3-axis sun/star stabilized spacecraft which was based on the design of the Phobos orbiters. It had a deployable high and medium gain antennae. Two large solar panels were attached to either side of the spacecraft. It also had a jettisonable propulsion unit to be separated sometime after Mars orbit insertion. Two Surface Stations were attached on top of the spacecraft. Two Penetrators were attached to the propulsion unit. It also had a MORION system which was the central interface, microprocessor, and memory system. The orbiter had a total mass, with fuel, of 6,180 kg. It had a dry mass of 3,159 kg. Mars 96 Surface Station  Surface station  Each Surface Station was contained in an aeroshell about 1 meter high and about 1 meter in diameter. Each station had a Station Data Processing Unit (SDPI) for controlling station operations, telecommunications unit with a transmitter and a receiver for data transfer, and a power supply consisting of two radio- isotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), a battery, and electronics for controlling battery charge. Each Surface Station also carried a compact disc which contained science fiction stories, sound, and art that have inspired Mars exploration. It was intended as a gift for future human explorers. The expected lifetime of each Surface Station was one year. Mars 96 Penetrator  Penetrator  Each Penetrator consisted of two major structures: The forebody and the afterbody. When the Penetrator struck the surface the forebody was designed to separate and delve 5 to 6 meters into the surface while the afterbody remained on the surface connected to the forebody by wires. The forebody contained the housekeeping equipment and part of the analysing package while the afterbody contained the rest of the analysing package and the radio equipment. Each Penetrator was powered by a radio-isotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) and a battery. The expected lifetime of each Penetrator was one year.  Scientific instruments = Orbiter  Mars 96 probe & lander engineering model at Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center Virginia, USA. ;ARGUS: The ARGUS platform consisted of two TV cameras and a mapping spectrometer. The ARGUS had its own multiprocesser control system, a navigation TV camera (not related to the other two), a data acquisition system with a 1.5 GBit memory, a thermal control system, and an in-flight calibration system. It was designed to point the instruments attached to it with high accuracy on all three axes. ;PAIS: The PAIS platform was designed to mount and point the SPICAM, EVRIS, and PHOTON instruments. ;HRSC: The High Resolution Stereoscopic TV-Camera (HRSC) was designed to make detailed topographical studies and make atmospheric studies of cloud structures, limb brightness, and terminator features. It was one of the cameras mounted to the ARGUS platform. The design was reused in the Mars Express HRSC camera. ;WAOSS: The Wide-Angle Steroscopic TV-Camera (WAOSS) was designed to globally monitor Mars over time to make studies of cloud movement, surface changes due to dust storms, and other long-term observations of the surface and atmosphere.

Planned mission = Launch  The launch was to take place on November 16, 1996 on a Proton 8K82K/11S824F rocket. This is a four-stage rocket in a configuration which had flown only twice before, both times to launch Phobos spacecraft towards Mars in 1988. The first three stages were to burn to fuel depletion. The fourth stage, called the Block D-2, would then ignite to place it and the spacecraft into a parking orbit around the Earth. Later it was to re-ignite to begin the trans-Mars injection maneuver. After the fourth stage shut-down, the spacecraft was to separate, deploy its antennae, and use its propulsion unit to complete the burn. After this was complete, the spacecraft was to deploy its solar panels and the PAIS science platform.  Interplanetary cruise  The cruise was to take about 10 months. Two course corrections were planned on the way. Astrophysical studies were also to take place during interplanetary cruise. Mars arrival was scheduled to take place on September 12, 1997.  Arrival  Four to five (preferably five) days before arrival, the spacecraft was to release both Surface Stations to land at two separate sites in the northern hemisphere. After release, the spacecraft would perform a deflection maneuver to change the orbiter's trajectory to a fly-by path in preparation for orbit insertion. At the appropriate moment, with the main engine of the propulsion unit facing the direction of flight, the spacecraft would make a burn to slow down and enter Mars orbit. Initial Mars orbit would have a periapsis of 500 km, an apoapsis of about 52,000 km, with an orbital period of 43.09 hours.  Surface Station landing  While the orbiter performed the orbit insertion burn, both Surface Stations were to make a soft landing on Mars. Both landing sequences were identical. They began with the craft being slowed down by aerodynamic pressure. At an altitude of 19.1 km, a parachute would deploy, followed by heat shield separation at 18.3 km, and inflation of the airbags at 17.9 km. When the lander, cushioned by the airbags, hit the ground, the parachute would separate. The airbag would eventually roll to a stop. After which both airbags would separate revealing the lander. The four petals would open and the lander would signal the orbiter when it passed over the landing site.  Mars orbit  The first task the orbiter would perform after achieving Mars orbit was to receive a signal from both Surface Stations to confirm landing. The window to land the Penetrators would be seven to twenty-eight days after Mars orbit insertion. The primary science phase of the orbiter could not begin until after both Penetrators were released and the propulsion unit was jettisoned.  Penetrator landing  The landing of each Penetrator would be identical. It began with the spinning up of the Penetrator for stability followed by separation from the orbiter. The Penetrator would fire a solid rocket motor which would begin to drop it from orbit. After 20‚Äì22 hours, the Penetrator would encounter the Martian atmosphere. It then deploys a braking device. When it impacts, the forebody separates and goes in deeper than the main body. It then performs a communications session with the orbiter to confirm landing.  Orbiter primary science phase  About a month after orbit insertion, after the Penetrators have been released, the orbiter would jettison its propulsion unit. The propulsion unit would get in the way of the deployment of the LWR instrument and ARGUS platform and has to be jettisoned before the primary science phase can begin. The nominal mission of the orbiter would have lasted one Earth year. After the propulsion unit was jettisoned, the orbiter had a low power thrust system for orbit maintenance. During the nominal phase a fly-by of Deimos was possible, but a fly-by of Phobos was not possible until after the nominal mission. If an extended mission were approved, aerobraking over a period of two to three months would have reduced the orbital period to around nine hours. Mars 96 on the launch pad  Mission failure  The rocket lifted off on November 16, 1996 at 20:48:53 UTC. The rocket performed properly up to parking orbit. The planned second burn of the Block D-2 fourth stage failed to take place. The spacecraft separated and then performed its engine burn automatically. Unfortunately, without the fourth stage burn, the spacecraft lowered its perigee back into the Earth's atmosphere causing reentry. The fourth stage re-entered on a later orbit. There is disagreement between American and Russian sources on the timeline.  Conclusions  A review board could not determine whether the Mars 96 crash was due to failure of the Proton rocket Block D-2 upper stage or a malfunction of the Mars 96 spacecraft itself. The failure investigation board concluded that lack of telemetry data during critical parts of the mission prevented identification of the cause of the failure. The failure occurred at the second ignition of the Proton Block D-2 upper stage, while the spacecraft was out of range of Russian ground stations. The Mars 96 spacecraft carried 200 grams of plutonium-238 in the form of small pellets. They were designed to withstand heat and impact and are thought to have survived re-entry. The Block D-2 stage carried no plutonium. The spacecraft is believed to have crashed somewhere in a 320 km long by 80 wide oval running southwest to northeast and centered 32 km east of Iquique, Chile. No parts of the spacecraft or upper stage have been recovered.Mars 96 Failure ‚Äì Timeline from launch to re-entry  Fate of the plutonium fuel  It was originally believed that the Mars 96 assembly burnt up in the atmosphere and the debris fell into the Pacific Ocean. However, in March 1997, the US Space Command admitted that it had miscalculated the satellite's path of re-entry. \\"We were aware of a number of eyewitness accounts of the re-entry event via the media several weeks after the re-entry occurred,\\" wrote Major Stephen Boylan, Chief of the Media Division at the US Space Command in Colorado Springs. \\"Upon further analysis, we believe it is reasonable that the impact was in fact on land.\\" Mars 96 carried four assemblies designed to enter the Martian atmosphere, two surface penetrators and two surface stations. These would almost certainly have survived entry into Earth's atmosphere. The two surface penetrators were designed to survive an impact with the ground. Despite this and the fact that the four assemblies carried a combined total of 200 grams of plutonium-238 for fuel, the Russians have not mounted any recovery effort to date.  Missions based on Mars 96  A number of later missions, both planned and successful, are based on the technology of Mars 96, for example ESA's Mars Express (launched in 2003), NetLander (cancelled) and its successor MetNet (proposed for launches in 2016‚Äì2019). Some of the equipment designs from Mars 96 were used for Mars 500 experiments.

He organised many tours around rural India for the promotion of scientific thinking, exposing alleged miracles and scams carried out by various charlatans, godmen, prophets etc. and spreading awareness of superstition. Premanand was the founder of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations, the convener of Indian CSICOP and the owner-publisher-editor of the monthly magazine The Indian Skeptic, which scientifically investigates paranormal occurrences in India. He was known as one of the most vocal critics of Sathya Sai Baba. Early life Premanand was born on 17 February 1930 in Kozhikode, Kerala. His parents were followers of the Theosophical Society. In the 1940s, Premanand quit school to take part in the Quit India Movement. With that his traditional schooling ended. His next seven years were spent in the newly started Sri-Steila Gurukula, where the Shantiniketan-Wardha brand of education was imparted. He was strongly influenced by Helena Blavatsky in his early years and in 1969 met the Sri Lankan skeptic Abraham Kovoor during his Miracle Exposure lecture tour in India. Since then, Premanand became a critic of Theosophy, and succeeded Kovoor after he died in 1978. Activism Around 1975 Premanand started publicly denouncing the Indian godman Sathya Sai Baba, and devoted his life to exposing godmen and paranormal phenomena. He was arrested in 1986 by the police for marching, with 500 volunteers, towards Puttaparthi, the town where the guru's main ashram is located; in the same year he sued Sai Baba for materializing gold objects in violation of the Gold Control Act. The case was dismissed, whereupon Premanand put in an appeal on the ground that spiritual power is not a defence recognised in law, which was also unsuccessful. In 1993, he published his book Murders in Sai Baba's Bedroom, about the killing of six inmates at Sai Baba's ashram, which he claimed was overlooked by the authorities. His allegations against Sai Baba further include sexual and economic offences. Premanand claimed that he survived four murder attempts and bore injuries from beatings for his activism, and was known as one of Sai Baba's most vocal critics. Premanand used his skills as an amateur magician to try to give a natural explanation for some of the alleged miracles of gurus and godmen. Guru Busters,http://www.eagletv.co.uk/projects/guru-busters.html the documentary by the British filmmaker Robert Eagle, features Premanand displaying and teaching his own interpretation and explanation for many supposedly supernatural stunts, such as levitation, flesh-piercing and live burials. He took an active part in the Vigyan Yatra (\\"Rally for Science\\") organised by Maharashtra Lok Vidnyan in 1982 to popularise science and scientific thinking, as well as in the Bharat Jan Vigyan Jatha held in 1987 espousing the same cause. He is also credited with the formation of the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (ANiS) in 1989. On 7 February 1997, Premanand founded the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations, which tours Indian villages to spread his natural explanations of gurus and fakirs whom he considered frauds or self-deceived. He was the convener of Indian CSICOP, a Tamil Nadu-based skeptic group which is an affiliate of CSICOP. He was the owner-publisher-editor of the monthly magazine The Indian Skeptic, which \\"publishes articles on the scientific investigation of apparently paranormal occurrences with a special emphasis on cases from India\\". Once referred to in a BBC anti-guru show as India's leading guru-buster, Premanand has \\"been honoured by the government with its highest award for the promotion of scientific values among the public.\\"The Telegraph, Calcutta: Sunday, 21 November 2004 The paranormal challenge In 1963, Abraham Kovoor offered an award of INR100,000 to anyone who could demonstrate supernatural or miraculous powers under foolproof and fraud-proof conditions. After Kovoor's death in 1978, Premanand continued his challenge by offering INR100,000 to any person who could demonstrate psychic, supernatural of paranormal ability of any kind under satisfactorily observed conditions. This challenge has not been contested and won. Death Premanand was diagnosed with cancer in 2006 and underwent major surgery. He died on 4 October 2009 at Podanur, Tamil Nadu and, according to his wishes,James Randi Educational Foundation Obituary his body was donated to a local medical college. He was succeeded by Narendra Nayak and his property, assets and the copyright of his 26 books were given to The Federation for Indian Rationalists Association.

This migratory bird breeds in eastern North America and winters in Central America, many Caribbean islands, Florida and northern Venezuela. Taxonomy The genus Seiurus is currently treated as monotypic, containing only the ovenbird; it is genetically distinct from all other species in the family Parulidae, probably the first genus to evolve separately from the rest of the family. Before the recent genetic studies were carried out, the waterthrushes were also included in Seiurus; these are now treated separately in the genus Parkesia as they are not very closely related to the ovenbird. The species name aurocapilla is a noun phrase, so the original spelling is retained, not changed according to the gender of the genus name; Linnaeus originally named it Motacilla aurocapilla, and the ending is not changed to -us as commonly cited in the past. [Seiurus aurocapilla, item #169, p. 38]. Etymologically aurocapilla comes from Latin and means \\"golden haired\\" and Seiurus is from Ancient Greek sei≈ç, \\"to shake\\", and oura, \\"tail\\".

Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . They tend to be heavier in winter and particularly at the start of their migration. They have olive-brown upperparts and white underparts heavily streaked with black; the flanks have an olive hue. A white ring surrounds the eyes, and a black stripe runs below the cheek. They have a line of orange feathers with olive-green tips running along the top of their head, bordered on each side with blackish-brown. The orange feathers can be erected to form a small crest. The eyes and the upper part of the thin pointed beak are dark, while the lower beak is horn-colored and the legs and feet are pinkish. Males and females look alike. Immature birds have tawny fringes to the tertiary remiges and sometimes buff-tipped outer primary wing coverts. Most conspicuously, the olive-green tips of the crown feathers, which are hardly visible in adult birds, are far larger in extent in immatures and cover the orange crown-stripe almost or completely. The main song of the ovenbird is a series of strident, relatively low-pitched, bisyallabic motives repeated without pause about eight times and increasing in volume. Usually, the second syllable in each motive is sharply accented: \\"chur-tee‚Äô chur-tee‚Äô chur-tee‚Äô chur-tee‚Äô chur-TEE chur-TEE chur-TEE!\\" Male ovenbirds utter a sweet chattering song in the air at twilight, after the manner of the skylark, incorporating portions of the main song into a jumble of sputtering notes and mimicry as they dive back to earth. The call is a variably pitched, sharp \\"chik!\\" Some variations recall the common call note of a downy woodpecker. If the bird is excited, it may repeat this call several times. The fight call is a high, rising siiii. Ovenbird song recorded in Minnesota  Range and ecology  Their breeding habitats are mature deciduous and mixed forests, especially sites with little undergrowth, across Canada and the eastern United States. For foraging, it prefers woodland with abundant undergrowth of shrubs; essentially, it thrives best in a mix of primary and secondary forest. Ovenbirds migrate to the southeastern United States, the Caribbean, and from Mexico to northern South America. The birds are territorial all year round, occurring either singly or (in the breeding season) as mated pairs, for a short time accompanied by their young. During migration, they tend to travel in larger groups however, dispersing again once they reach their destination. In winter, they dwell mainly in lowlands, but may ascend up to ASL e.g. in Costa Rica. The first migrants leave in late August and appear on the wintering grounds as early as September, with successive waves arriving until late October or so. They depart again to breed between late March and early May, arriving on the breeding grounds throughout April and May. Migration times do not seem to have changed much over the course of the 20th century. This bird seems just capable of crossing the Atlantic, as there have been a handful of records in Norway, Ireland and Great Britain. However, half of the six finds were of dead birds. A live ovenbird on St Mary's, Isles of Scilly in October 2004 was in bad condition, and died despite being taken into care.Rogers, M. J. et al. (2005). Report on rare birds in Great Britain in 2004. British Birds 98: 628‚Äì694 [Ovenbird, p. 688]. Ovenbirds forage on the ground in dead leaves, sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. This bird frequently tilts its tail up and bobs its head while walking; at rest, the tail may be flicked up and slowly lowered again, and alarmed birds flick the tail frequently from a half-raised position. These birds mainly eat terrestrial arthropods and snails, and also include fruit in their diet during winter. The nest, referred to as the \\"oven\\" (which gives the bird its name), is a domed structure placed on the ground, woven from vegetation, and containing a side entrance. The female usually lays 4-5 eggs speckled with brown or gray. Only the female incubates, for 11-14 days. Young are altricial and are fed by both parents. First flight is at 8-11 days of age. The placement of the nest on the ground makes predation by snakes, red squirrels, and chipmunks (Tamias) a greater concern than for tree-nesting birds. Chipmunks have been known to burrow directly into the nest to eat the young birds. The female can perform a distraction display, simulating a crippled bird, when a potential predator is in the vicinity of the nest. The ovenbird is vulnerable to nest parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), which is becoming more plentiful in some areas. However, the ovenbirds' numbers appear to be remaining stable. Altogether, it is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. In literature It is the subject of a poem by Robert Frost, \\"The Oven Bird\\", published in his poetry collection Mountain Interval in 1916. Robert Bly also makes reference to \\"the nimble oven bird\\" in his short poem \\"The Slim Fir Seeds.\\"  References  * Ovenbird Species Account ‚Äì Cornell Lab of Ornithology * Ovenbird ‚Äì Seiurus aurocapillus ‚Äì USGS Patuxent Bird Identification InfoCenter Ovenbird info If you would like more facts about the Ovenbird click here Category:Seiurus Category:New World warblers Category:Native birds of Eastern Canada Category:Native birds of the Eastern United States Category:Birds of the Dominican Republic Category:Birds described in 1766 Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Ovenbird"},{"id":"440778","text":"Amanita pantherina, also known as the panther cap and false blusher due to its similarity to the true blusher (Amanita rubescens), is a species of fungus found in Europe and Western Asia.

Contrary to the Amanita rubescens the panther cap does not color red/pink (\\"blush\\") when the flesh is damaged, hence its name \\"false blusher\\". This is a key feature in differentiating both species. Habitat and distribution Amanita ameripathera The panther cap is an uncommon mushroom, found in both deciduous, especially beech and, less frequently, coniferous woodland and rarely meadows throughout Europe, western Asia in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded from South Africa, where it is thought to have been accidentally introduced with trees imported from Europe, and on Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, Canada. It is an ectomycorrhizal fungus, living in root symbiosis with a tree, deriving photosynthesised nutrients from it and providing soil nutrients in return. Biochemistry and toxicity Amanita pantherina contains the psychoactive compound muscimol, but is used as an entheogen much less often than its much more distinguishable relative Amanita muscaria. Amanita pantherina var. pantherinoides is considered inedible and possibly poisonous. Varieties multisquamosa and velatipes are considered poisonous. Legal status Amanita muscaria and Amanita pantherina are illegal to buy, sell, or possess in the Netherlands since December 2008.

Tanenbaum and others at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The aim of the Amoeba project was to build a timesharing system that makes an entire network of computers appear to the user as a single machine. Development at the Vrije Universiteit was stopped: the source code of the latest version (5.3) was last modified on 30 July 1996. The Python programming language was originally developed for this platform. Overview The goal of the Amoeba project was to construct an operating system for networks of computers that would present the network to the user as if it were a single machine. An Amoeba network consists of a number of workstations connected to a \\"pool\\" of processors, and executing a program from a terminal causes it to run on any of the available processors, with the operating system providing load balancing. Unlike the contemporary Sprite, Amoeba does not support process migration.Fred Douglis, M. Frans Kaashoek, Andrew S. Tanenbaum and John Ousterhout (1991). A comparison of two distributed systems: Amoeba and Sprite. Computing Systems 4(4), pp. 353‚Äì384. The workstations would typically function as networked terminals only. Aside from workstations and processors, additional machines operate as servers for files, directory services, TCP/IP communications etc.Andrew S. Tanenbaum, M.

It offers multithreaded programs and a remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism for communication between threads, potentially across the network; even kernel-threads use this RPC mechanism for communication. Each thread is assigned a 48-bit number called its \\"port\\", which serves as its unique, network-wide \\"address\\" for communication. The user interface and APIs of Amoeba were modeled after Unix and compliance with the POSIX standard was partially implemented; some of the Unix emulation code consists of utilities ported over from Tanenbaum's other operating system, MINIX. Early versions used a \\"homebrew\\" window system, which the Amoeba authors considered \\"faster ... in our view, cleaner ... smaller and much easier to understand\\", but version 4.0 uses the X Window System (and allows X terminals as terminals). The system uses FLIP as a network protocol.

H. Tellegen as a hypothetical fifth linear element after the resistor, capacitor, inductor and ideal transformer. Unlike the four conventional elements, the gyrator is non-reciprocal. Gyrators permit network realizations of two-(or-more)-port devices which cannot be realized with just the conventional four elements. In particular, gyrators make possible network realizations of isolators and circulators. Gyrators do not however change the range of one-port devices that can be realized. Although the gyrator was conceived as a fifth linear element, its adoption makes both the ideal transformer and either the capacitor or inductor redundant. Thus the number of necessary linear elements is in fact reduced to three. Circuits that function as gyrators can be built with transistors and op-amps using feedback. Tellegen's proposed symbol for his gyrator Tellegen invented a circuit symbol for the gyrator and suggested a number of ways in which a practical gyrator might be built. An important property of a gyrator is that it inverts the current‚Äìvoltage characteristic of an electrical component or network. In the case of linear elements, the impedance is also inverted. In other words, a gyrator can make a capacitive circuit behave inductively, a series LC circuit behave like a parallel LC circuit, and so on. It is primarily used in active filter design and miniaturization.  Behaviour  Gyrator schematic labelled An ideal gyrator is a linear two port device which couples the current on one port to the voltage on the other and vice versa. The instantaneous currents and instantaneous voltages are related by :v_2 = R i_1 :v_1 = - R i_2 where \\\\scriptstyle{R} is the gyration resistance of the gyrator. The gyration resistance (or equivalently its reciprocal the gyration conductance) has an associated direction indicated by an arrow on the schematic diagram. By convention, the given gyration resistance or conductance relates the voltage on the port at the head of the arrow to the current at its tail. The voltage at the tail of the arrow is related to the current at its head by minus the stated resistance. Reversing the arrow is equivalent to negating the gyration resistance, or to reversing the polarity of either port. Although a gyrator is characterized by its resistance value, it is a lossless component. From the governing equations, the instantaneous power into the gyrator is identically zero. :P = v_1 i_1 + v_2 i_2 = (-R i_2) i_1 + (R i_1) i_2 \\\\equiv 0 A gyrator is an entirely non-reciprocal device, and hence is represented by antisymmetric impedance and admittance matrices: : Z = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -R \\\\ R & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\quad Y = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & G \\\\ -G & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\quad G = \\\\frac{1}{R} If the gyration resistance is chosen to be equal to the characteristic impedance of the two ports (or to their geometric mean if these are not the same), then the scattering matrix for the gyrator is : S = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} which is likewise antisymmetric. This leads to an alternative definition of a gyrator: a device which transmits a signal unchanged in the forward (arrow) direction, but reverses the polarity of the signal travelling in the backward direction (or equivalently, 180¬∞ phase-shifts the backward travelling signal). The symbol used to represent a gyrator in one-line diagrams (where a waveguide or transmission line is shown as a single line rather than as a pair of conductors), reflects this one-way phase shift. As with a quarter wave transformer, if one of port of the gyrator is terminated with a linear load, then the other port presents an impedance inversely proportional to that of the load, :\\\\ Z_\\\\mathrm{in} = \\\\frac{R^2}{Z_\\\\mathrm{load}} A generalization of the gyrator is conceivable, in which the forward and backward gyration conductances have different magnitudes, so that the admittance matrix is : Y = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & G_1 \\\\ -G_2 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} However this no longer represents a passive device.Theodore Deliyannis, Yichuang Sun, J. Kel Fidler, Continuous-time active filter design, pp.81-82, CRC Press, 1999 .  Name  Tellegen named the element gyrator as a portmanteau of gyroscope and the common device suffix -tor (as in resistor, capacitor, transistor etc.) The -tor ending is even more suggestive in Tellegen's native Dutch where the related element transformer is called transformator. The gyrator is related to the gyroscope by an analogy in its behaviour.Arthur Garratt, \\"Milestones in electronics: an interview with professor Bernard Tellegen\\", Wireless World, vol. 85, no. 1521, pp. 133-140, May 1979. The analogy with the gyroscope is due to the relationship between the torque and angular velocity of the gyroscope on the two axes of rotation. A torque on one axis will produce a proportional change in angular velocity on the other axis and vice versa. A mechanical-electrical analogy of the gyroscope making torque and angular velocity the analogs of voltage and current results in the electrical gyrator.Forbes T. Brown, Engineering System Dynamics, pp. 56-57, CRC Press, 2006 .  Relationship to the ideal transformer  Cascaded gyrators An ideal gyrator is similar to an ideal transformer in being a linear, lossless, passive, memoryless two-port device. However, whereas a transformer couples the voltage on port 1 to the voltage on port 2, and the current on port 1 to the current on port 2, the gyrator cross-couples voltage to current and current to voltage. Cascading two gyrators achieves a voltage-to-voltage coupling identical to that of an ideal transformer. Cascaded gyrators of gyration resistance \\\\scriptstyle{R_1} and \\\\scriptstyle{R_2} are equivalent to a transformer of turns ratio \\\\scriptstyle{R_1 : R_2}. Cascading a transformer and a gyrator, or equivalently cascading three gyrators produces a single gyrator of gyration resistance \\\\scriptstyle{\\\\frac{R_1 R_3}{R_2}}. From the point of view of network theory, transformers are redundant when gyrators are available. Anything that can be built from resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers and gyrators, can also be built using just resistors, gyrators and inductors (or capacitors). Magnetic circuit analogy In the two- gyrator equivalent circuit for a transformer, described above, the gyrators may be identified with the transformer windings, and the loop connecting the gyrators with the transformer magnetic core. The electric current around the loop then corresponds to the rate-of-change of magnetic flux through the core, and the electromotive force (EMF) in the loop due to each gyrator corresponds to the magnetomotive force (MMF) in the core due to each winding. The gyration resistances are in the same ratio as the winding turn-counts, but collectively of no particular magnitude. So, choosing an arbitrary conversion factor of r ohms per turn, a loop EMF, V, is related to a core MMF, \\\\mathcal{F}, by :V = r \\\\mathcal{F} and the loop current I is related to the core flux-rate \\\\dot{\\\\Phi} by :I = \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\Phi The core of a real, non- ideal, transformer has finite permeance \\\\mathcal{P} (non-zero reluctance \\\\mathcal{R}), such that the flux and total MMF satisfy :\\\\Phi = \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{F}}{\\\\mathcal{R}} = \\\\mathcal{P} \\\\mathcal{F} which means that in the gyrator loop :I = \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{P}}{r^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} V corresponding to the introduction of a series capacitor :C = \\\\frac{1}{r^2} \\\\mathcal{P} in the loop. This is Buntenbach's capacitance-permeance analogy, or the gyrator-capacitor model of magnetic circuits.  Application =Simulated inductor  An example of a gyrator simulating inductance, with an approximate equivalent circuit below. The two Zin have similar values in typical applications. Circuit from A gyrator can be used to transform a load capacitance into an inductance. At low frequencies and low powers, the behaviour of the gyrator can be reproduced by a small op-amp circuit. This supplies a means of providing an inductive element in a small electronic circuit or integrated circuit. Before the invention of the transistor, coils of wire with large inductance might be used in electronic filters. An inductor can be replaced by a much smaller assembly containing a capacitor, operational amplifiers or transistors, and resistors. This is especially useful in integrated circuit technology. = Operation = In the circuit shown, one port of the gyrator is between the input terminal and ground, while the other port is terminated with the capacitor. The circuit works by inverting and multiplying the effect of the capacitor in an RC differentiating circuit where the voltage across the resistor R behaves through time in the same manner as the voltage across an inductor. The op-amp follower buffers this voltage and applies it back to the input through the resistor RL. The desired effect is an impedance of the form of an ideal inductor L with a series resistance RL: Z = R_\\\\mathrm{L} + j \\\\omega L \\\\,! From the diagram, the input impedance of the op-amp circuit is: Z_\\\\mathrm{in} = \\\\left( R_\\\\mathrm{L} + j \\\\omega R_\\\\mathrm{L} R C \\\\right) \\\\ \\\\left( R + {1 \\\\over {j \\\\omega C}} \\\\right) With RLRC = L, it can be seen that the impedance of the simulated inductor is the desired impedance in parallel with the impedance of the RC circuit. In typical designs, R is chosen to be sufficiently large such that the first term dominates; thus, the RC circuit's effect on input impedance is negligible. Z_\\\\mathrm{in} \\\\approx R_\\\\mathrm{L} + j \\\\omega R_\\\\mathrm{L} R C \\\\,! This is the same as a resistance RL in series with an inductance L = RLRC. There is a practical limit on the minimum value that RL can take, determined by the current output capability of the op-amp. The impedance cannot increase indefinitely with frequency, and eventually the second term limits the impedance to the value of R. = Comparison with actual inductors = Simulated elements are electronic circuits that imitate actual elements. Simulated elements cannot replace physical inductors in all the possible applications as they do not possess all the unique properties of physical inductors. Magnitudes. In typical applications, both the inductance and the resistance of the gyrator are much greater than that of a physical inductor. Gyrators can be used to create inductors from the microhenry range up to the megahenry range. Physical inductors are typically limited to tens of henries, and have parasitic series resistances from hundreds of microhms through the low kilohm range. The parasitic resistance of a gyrator depends on the topology, but with the topology shown, series resistances will typically range from tens of ohms through hundreds of kilohms. Quality. Physical capacitors are often much closer to \\"ideal capacitors\\" than physical inductors are to \\"ideal inductors\\". Because of this, a synthesized inductor realized with a gyrator and a capacitor may, for certain applications, be closer to an \\"ideal inductor\\" than any (practical) physical inductor can be. Thus, use of capacitors and gyrators may improve the quality of filter networks that would otherwise be built using inductors. Also, the Q factor of a synthesized inductor can be selected with ease. The Q of an LC filter can be either lower or higher than that of an actual LC filter - for the same frequency, the inductance is much higher, the capacitance much lower, but the resistance also higher. Gyrator inductors typically have higher accuracy than physical inductors, due to the lower cost of precision capacitors than inductors. Energy storage. Simulated inductors do not have the inherent energy storing properties of the real inductors and this limits the possible power applications. The circuit cannot respond like a real inductor to sudden input changes (it does not produce a high-voltage back EMF); its voltage response is limited by the power supply. Since gyrators use active circuits, they only function as a gyrator within the power supply range of the active element. Hence gyrators are usually not very useful for situations requiring simulation of the 'flyback' property of inductors, where a large voltage spike is caused when current is interrupted. A gyrator's transient response is limited by the bandwidth of the active device in the circuit and by the power supply. Externalities. Simulated inductors do not react to external magnetic fields and permeable materials the same way that real inductors do. They also don't create magnetic fields (and induce currents in external conductors) the same way that real inductors do. This limits their use in applications such as sensors, detectors and transducers. Grounding. The fact that one side of the simulated inductor is grounded restricts the possible applications (real inductors are floating). This limitation may preclude its use in some low-pass and notch filters.. Carter page 1 states, \\"The fact that one side of the inductor is grounded precludes its use in low-pass and notch filters, leaving high-pass and band-pass filters as the only possible applications.\\" However the gyrator can be used in a floating configuration with another gyrator so long as the floating \\"grounds\\" are tied together. This allows for a floating gyrator, but the inductance simulated across the input terminals of the gyrator pair must be cut in half for each gyrator to ensure that the desired inductance is met (the impedance of inductors in series adds together). This is not typically done as it requires even more components than in a standard configuration and the resulting inductance is a result of two simulated inductors, each with half of the desired inductance. = Applications = The primary application for a gyrator is to reduce the size and cost of a system by removing the need for bulky, heavy and expensive inductors. For example, RLC bandpass filter characteristics can be realized with capacitors, resistors and operational amplifiers without using inductors. Thus graphic equalizers can be achieved with capacitors, resistors and operational amplifiers without using inductors because of the invention of the gyrator. Gyrator circuits are extensively used in telephony devices that connect to a POTS system. This has allowed telephones to be much smaller, as the gyrator circuit carries the DC part of the line loop current, allowing the transformer carrying the AC voice signal to be much smaller due to the elimination of DC current through it. Joe Randolph. AN-5: \\"Transformer-based phone line interfaces (DAA, FXO)\\". Gyrators are used in most DAAs (data access arrangements). \\"Gyrator - DC Holding Circuit\\" Circuitry in telephone exchanges has also been affected with gyrators being used in line cards. Gyrators are also widely used in hi-fi for graphic equalizers, parametric equalizers, discrete bandstop and bandpass filters such as rumble filters), and FM pilot tone filters. There are many applications where it is not possible to use a gyrator to replace an inductor: * High voltage systems utilizing flyback (beyond working voltage of transistors/amplifiers) * RF systems commonly use real inductors as they are quite small at these frequencies and integrated circuits to build an active gyrator are either expensive or non-existent. However, passive gyrators are possible. * Power conversion, where a coil is used as energy storage. Passive gyrators Numerous passive circuits exist in theory for a gyrator function. However, when constructed of lumped elements there are always negative elements present. These negative elements have no corresponding real component so cannot be implemented in isolation. Such circuits can be used in practice, in filter design for instance, if the negative elements are absorbed into an adjacent positive element. Once active components are permitted, however, a negative element can easily be implemented with a negative impedance converter. For instance, a real capacitor can be transformed into an equivalent negative inductor. In microwave circuits, impedance inversion can be achieved using a quarter-wave impedance transformer instead of a gyrator. The quarter-wave transformer is a passive device and is far simpler to build than a gyrator. Unlike the gyrator, the transformer is a reciprocal component. The transformer is an example of a distributed-element circuit.Matthaei, George L.; Young, Leo and Jones, E. M. T. Microwave Filters, Impedance- Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures, pp. 434-440, McGraw-Hill 1964 (1980 edition is ).  In other energy domains  Analogs of the gyrator exist in other energy domains. The analogy with the mechanical gyroscope has already been pointed out in the name section. Also, when systems involving multiple energy domains are being analysed as a unified system through analogies, such as mechanical-electrical analogies, the transducers between domains are considered either transformers or gyrators depending on which variables they are translating.Clarence W. de Silva, Mechatronics: An Integrated Approach, pp. 62-65, CRC Press, 2004 . Electromagnetic transducers translate current into force and velocity into voltage. In the impedance analogy however, force is the analog of voltage and velocity is the analog of current, thus electromagnetic transducers are gyrators in this analogy. On the other hand, piezoelectric transducers are transformers (in the same analogy).Forbes T. Brown, Engineering System Dynamics, pp. 57-58, CRC Press, 2006 . Thus another possible way to make an electrical passive gyrator is to use transducers to translate into the mechanical domain and back again, much as is done with mechanical filters. Such a gyrator can be made with a single mechanical element by using a multiferroic material using its magnetoelectric effect. For instance, a current carrying coil wound around a multiferroic material will cause vibration through the multiferroic's magnetostrictive property. This vibration will induce a voltage between electrodes embedded in the material through the multiferroic's piezoelectric property. The overall effect is to translate a current into a voltage resulting in gyrator action.Haribabu Palneedi, Venkateswarlu Annapureddy, Shashank Priya and Jungho Ryu, \\"Status and perspectives of multiferroic magnetoelectric composite materials and applications\\", Actuators, vol. 5, iss. 1, sect. 5, 2016.Nian X.

Raised on a farm in Pennsylvania, Olver graduated from college at the age of 18 and went on to earn a Ph.D. in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and later taught chemistry at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for eight years. He served in both chambers of the Massachusetts General Court, being elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1968, and the Massachusetts Senate in 1972. He ran in a 1991 special election to succeed 17-term Congressman Silvio O. Conte, who died in office. He was the first Democrat to ever represent the . Olver announced that he would not seek re-election in 2012, and retired at the end of his eleventh term in Congress after his district was dismantled in redistricting. Early life, education, and career Olver was born on September 3, 1936 in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, the son of Helen Marguerite (n√©e Fulleborn) and Thomas Horace Olver. His paternal grandparents were of English descent and his maternal grandparents were German. Olver grew up on his father's farm, where the two tended cows, while his mother ran a boarding house which served families from Philadelphia and New York City. Olver graduated from high school when he was 15 and enrolled in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in chemistry at the age of 18. After earning his undergraduate degree, Olver went on to earn a Master of Science in chemistry from Tufts University in 1956, and a Doctor of Philosophy in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1961. Olver taught chemistry at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for eight years, and later resigned to pursue a career in politics. He served two terms as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from January 1, 1969, to January 3, 1973. He later served for nine terms in the Massachusetts Senate from January 3, 1973, until his resignation in 1991 to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. House of Representatives , during the second decade of Olver's tenure. The district is a primarily rural district that makes up most of Western Massachusetts. Elections On February 18, 1991, Congressman Silvio Conte died one month after taking office for his 17th term. That June, Olver, who had been sworn in for his 10th term in the state Senate a few months earlier, in January 1991, narrowly defeated Republican Steven Pierce in a special election for the seat, becoming the first Democrat to win the seat since it changed from being the in 1893.Duncan, Philip D., and Nutting, Brian (eds.)

Olver resigned from the state Senate on June 15 and was sworn in June 18. Olver won election to a full term in 1992. In 1994, the year which Republican took control of the House for the first time in 40 years, Olver ran unopposed. In 1996, he defeated State Senator and future Lieutenant and Acting Governor Jane Swift by a 53% to 47% margin. After 1996, Olver continually won re-election with high margins above 60%. On October 26, 2011 Olver announced he would not seek re-election in 2012, clearing the way for any potential Democratic primaries due to Massachusetts losing a congressional seat after the 2010 United States Census. His district had been eliminated in redistricting. The bulk of his former territory had been merged with the 2nd district of fellow Democrat Richard Neal, while his home in Amherst was drawn into the 2nd District (the old 3rd District) of fellow Democrat Jim McGovern. Tenure CQ's Politics in America described Olver as \\"a staunch liberal who prefers to yield the spotlight to other similarly ideological members.\\" Olver has consistently high rankings from the progressive lobbying group Americans for Democratic Action, and consistently low rankings from its conservative counterpart the American Conservative Union. As a superdelegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Olver endorsed future President Barack Obama. In a tribute to an outgoing Olver and Barney Frank, Ed Markey remarked that, unlike other elected officials who embraced superficial positions to curry public favor, the two were \\"happy to tell you [they] disagree with you\\" if they believed so. ;Foreign policy Olver has been a staunch opponent of the United States involvement in Iraq, and opposed a United States military presence in Iraq since the 2002 authorization for the use of force in Iraq. Olver has advocated for the removal of U.S. troops from Iraq, and has consistently voted against proposals to increase funding for military operations and increased deployment. Olver stated that he believes that the United States should seek out a political solution in cooperation with the states neighboring Iraq, such as Iran and Syria, rather than pursuing a strategy based primarily on military means in order to create a stable and democratic Iraq. Olver has been critical of the United States lack of involvement regarding the genocide in Darfur. Olver was one of five members of Congress arrested April 28, 2006 after protesting the genocide outside the Sudanese Embassy. Olver was arrested again in front of the Sudanese Embassy during a protest in 2012 along with other members of Congress and actor George Clooney. ;Domestic policy Olver was one of thirty-one House Representatives who voted to not count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election, which would have given the presidency to John Kerry. Olver co-sponsored which would introduce a universal health insurance program with single-payer financing. In addition to supporting different pieces of healthcare reform legislation in the House, Olver has also strongly supported allowing federal funds related to health care programs to fund abortion operations. In addition to supporting the inclusion of coverage for abortions in healthcare, Olver has consistently supported pro-choice legislation in the House and has received favorable ratings from pro-choice interest groups such as the NARAL Pro-Choice America, which gave Olver a rating of 100. Olver supports efforts to reduce the number of illegal immigrants entering the United States, but also believes in immigration reform so that qualified immigrants could more easily be granted entrance. Olver also believes that illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States need to be provided with a pathway to citizenship, and that these immigrants should not have to return to their countries of origin before obtaining citizenship.

There are similarities, however, between such markings and the tattoo traditions observed in other contemporaneous cultures. In the following period (c. 300 BC‚Äì300 AD) tattoo designs were observed and remarked upon by Chinese visitors. Such designs were thought to have spiritual significance as well as functioning as a status symbol. However, evidence suggesting a lack of tattooing traditions also exists; according to the early 8th-century , no such traditions of tattooing existed on the ancient Japanese mainland, with people who were tattooed regarded as outsiders. A further record in the (sometimes translated as The Chronicles of Japan, the second-oldest book of classical Japanese history) chronicles that tattooing traditions were confined only to the Ainu people. Starting in the Kofun period (300‚Äì600 AD), tattoos began to assume negative connotations. Instead of being used for ritual or status purposes, tattoo marks began to be placed on criminals as a punishment. Ainu tattoos The Ainu people, the indigenous people of northern Japan, are known for their traditions of tattooing, though few Ainu people and people of Ainu descent have these tattoos in the modern day. These tattoos were frequently used for decorative and social purposes, with both women and men being tattooed. Japanese tattoos in the Edo period A tattooed man's back, c. 1875 by . Brooklyn Museum Until the Edo period (1600‚Äì1868 AD), the role of tattoos in Japanese society fluctuated. Tattooed marks were still used as punishment, but minor fads for decorative tattoos, some featuring designs that would be completed only when lovers' hands were joined, also came and went. It was in the Edo period however, that Japanese decorative tattooing began to develop into the advanced art form it is known as today.Mitchell, Jon, \\"Loved abroad, hated at home: the art of Japanese tattooing\\", Japan Times, 4 March 2014, p. 10 The impetus for the development of as an artform was the development of the art of woodblock printing, and the release of the popular Chinese novel in 1757 in Japan;Shirane and Brandon, Early Modern Japanese Literature, p564. though the novel dates back several centuries before this, 1757 marked the released of the first Japanese edition. , a tale of rebel courage and manly bravery, was illustrated with lavish woodblock prints showing men in heroic scenes, their bodies decorated with dragons and other mythical beasts, flowers, ferocious tigers and religious images. The novel was an immediate success, creating a demand for the type of tattoos seen in the woodblock illustrations. Woodblock artists also began to practice tattooing, using many of the same tools they used for woodblock printing. These included chisels, gouges, and, most importantly, a unique type of ink known as \\" ink\\" or \\" black\\", which turns blue-green under the skin. There is some academic debate over who wore these elaborate tattoos. Some scholars say that it was the lower classes who wore ‚Äî and flaunted ‚Äî such tattoos. Others claim that wealthy merchants, barred by law from flaunting their wealth, wore expensive under their clothes. It is known for certain that became associated with firemen, who wore them as a form of spiritual protection. Tattoos in modern Japan Following the opening of Japan's borders to the rest of the world at the beginning of the Meiji period, the Japanese government, wishing to protect its image and make a good first impression in the face of its new international status, outlawed tattooing, with soon taking on connotations of criminality. Nevertheless, many foreigners, fascinated with the unique skills of Japanese tattoo artists, travelled to Japan with the express intention of being tattooed there, and traditional tattooing continued underground. Tattooing was legalized by the occupation forces in 1948, but has retained its image of criminality. For many years, traditional Japanese tattoos were associated with the yakuza, Japan's notorious mafia, and many businesses in Japan (such as public baths, fitness centers and hot springs) still ban customers with tattoos. Although tattoos have gained popularity among the youth of Japan due to Western influence, tattoos continue to be stigmatised throughout most of Japan; unlike many other countries, even finding a tattoo shop in Japan can prove difficult, with tattoo shops primarily placed in areas that are very tourist- or US military-friendly. According to , the president of the Japan Tattoo Institute, there are an estimated 300 tattoo artists throughout the entirety of Japan.(Fulford, 2004, para 2) Tattooed Yakuza gangsters There are even current political repercussions for tattoos in Japan; in 2012, the then-mayor of Osaka, , started a campaign to rid companies of their employees with tattoos, with the aim of employees either removing their tattoos if in an obvious place, or tattooed employees finding work elsewhere.(The Economist, 2012, para 3) This campaign was largely well- received by the public, with many large companies expressing support for the plan. Modern tattoos in Japan are done mostly in a similar manner to Western tattooing. Unlike traditional , where the design is mostly left up to the artist, customers bring in a design of their choice or can decide on what they would like at the shop. Many Japanese artists are well-versed in multiple styles besides traditional Japanese tattoos, giving customers the ability to select from a wide assortment of options. Modern tattoos are also done via an electric tattoo machine, in which the ink can be inserted into the machine, or the needle tip can be dipped into ink for application. Japanese artists are widely recognised for the quality of their work, despite the relative expense of tattoos, and are highly sought-after.(Tokyo Fashion, 2009, para 1) Despite the majority of modern tattooing being done by needle and machine, is also practiced with traditional tools, though tattoo artists trained in this style can be difficult to find; unlike most Western-style tattoo artists in Japan, the majority of traditional artists are not located in the Tokyo area. Also unlike Western tattooing is the high expense of the technique, as well as the higher proportion of time required to complete one piece and the higher level of pain involved. A typical traditional body suit, covering the arms, back, thighs and chest, with a space left down the centre of he torso, can take up to five years of weekly visits to complete, and cost in excess of US$30,000. The process is also more formal than Western tattooing, with the artist having a greater level of control over the finished design.Burton, Helena. \\"Oriental Irezumi and Occidental Tattooing in Contemporary Japan\\" . BME Magazine, reproduced at www.tattoo.yoso.eu. Accessed 12 June 2013. Process=Being tattooed Tattoo artist working on a body suit The process of being tattooed in the style can be difficult and time-consuming. The first step of finding a traditional tattoo artist can be a daunting task, as many tattoo artists in Japan are somewhat secretive in their work, with introductions made by word- of-mouth only, though the advent of the Internet has made finding an artists more accessible. After an initial consultation during which the client will discuss with the tattooist the designs they are interested in, the work begins with the tattooing of the outline. This will usually be done in one sitting, often freehand (without the use of a stencil), which may require several hours to complete. When the outline is complete, the shading and colouring is done in weekly visits, whenever the client has money to spare.fragment with artist and client from documentary about irezumi (2010) When the tattoo is finished, the artist will \\"sign\\" his name in a space reserved for that purpose, most often somewhere on the back. Wearers of traditional tattoos frequently keep their art secret, as tattoos are still seen as a sign of criminality in Japan, particularly by older people and in the work place. Many yakuza and other criminals themselves now avoid tattoos for this very reason. Becoming an artist The process of training to become a traditional tattoo artist is equally as difficult and time-consuming, if not moreso; tattoo artists will train for many years under a master, sometimes living in the master's house, and may spend years cleaning the studio, observing and practicing in their own skin, making both the needles and other tools required, mixing inks, and painstakingly copying designs from the master's book before being allowed to tattoo clients. Tattoo artists must the unique styles of tattooing by hand required, and will usually be given a tattoo name by their master, most often incorporating the word (to engrave) and a syllable derived from the master's own name, or some other significant word. In some cases, the apprentice will take the master's name, and will become The Second or Third (and so on).

Since July 2015, Meehan has served as the President of the University of Massachusetts after serving as Chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Lowell since September 2007. Meehan, a Democrat, served in the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 2007 as the Representative for Massachusetts's 5th congressional district.  Early life and education  Meehan was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, one of seven children born to Martin T. Meehan (d. 2000), a compositor for The Lowell Sun, and Alice (Britton) Meehan (d. 2008). He graduated from Lowell High School in 1974. Meehan attended the University of Massachusetts Lowell, graduating cum laude in 1978 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Education and Political Science. In 1981, Meehan graduated from Suffolk University with a Master of Public Administration degree, and a Juris Doctor from the Suffolk University Law School in 1986. He has received honorary degrees from the American College of Greece, Suffolk University, Green Mountain College in Vermont, and Shenkar College of Engineering & Design in Israel.  Early career  From 1978 to 1979, Meehan served on the staff to Lowell mayor Raymond F. Rourke. He was the press assistant to Representative James Michael Shannon from 1979 to 1981 and the head research analyst for the Massachusetts Senate's joint committee on election laws from 1981 to 1984. After completing law school, Meehan served as Director of Public Affairs to the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth and Deputy Secretary of State for Securities and Corporations from 1986 to 1990. From 1987 to 1988, Meehan was a member of the faculty of the University of Massachusetts Lowell and Harvard Law School. From 1991 to 1992, Meehan was the First Assistant District Attorney for Middlesex County, where he established an innovative \\"priority prosecution\\" policy that targeted hardened criminals.  U.S. House of Representatives  President Bill Clinton in 1993 Meehan ran for the U.S. House in the 1992 election, challenging another Democrat, the 4-term incumbent Chet Atkins. Atkins had a record of weak performances in Meehan's hometown of Lowell, only winning the city by 2 votes in his close-run 1990 re-election campaign. Atkins also was caught up in the House Bank overdraft scandal, with 127 overdrafts, the second most in the Massachusetts delegation. The delegation leader in bank overdrafts, Joseph Early with 140, decided not to run for re-election. Meehan beat Atkins, receiving 50,300 votes to Atkins' 26,855. After winning the Democratic primary, Meehan was elected on November 3, 1992. He took office in January 1993.  Tenure  Meehan is generally considered to be a political liberal. Meehan is a prominent advocate for campaign finance reform and was one of the major sponsors of Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (called the \\"Shays-Meehan Bill\\" in the House and the \\"McCain-Feingold Bill\\" in the Senate). He has also been noted for his activism on gay rights issues, and was the chief sponsor of the measure repealing the don't ask, don't tell policy. Meehan successfully ran for the House in 1992 on a platform of reform, including a commitment to pushing through term limits for members of the House. As part of that platform, Meehan made a pledge not to serve more than four terms. On the House floor in 1995, he scolded members who might go back on their promise to limit their tenure in office. \\"The best test of any politicians' credibility on term limits,\\" he said, \\"is whether they are willing to put their careers where their mouths are and limit their own service.\\" Despite his pledge, Meehan again ran for Congress in the year 2000, exceeding four terms by two and a half times.Catherine Edwards, The Promise of Term Limits , June 28, 1999.

This is the result of raising more money than he spent in several campaigns since his first in 1992. In 2016, after his first year as president of UMass, Meehan closed his congressional campaign signaling an end to his political career so he could focus his energies on leading the UMass system. In the 2004 Congressional race, Meehan raised $3,170,733 and spent $459,977 of that, thus adding $2,710,756 to his cash on hand. His opponent, Tom Tierney raised $30,943 and spent $30,406.

Deval Patrick (D-MA) announced a September 4 primary and an October 16 special election to determine Meehan's successor. The winner was Niki Tsongas, the widow of Paul Tsongas, who held the seat from 1974 to 1979 before being elected to the Senate. Meehan's former chief of staff, Lori Trahan, won his former seat, now numbered as the 3rd District, in 2018.  University of Massachusetts  Meehan became the President of the University of Massachusetts, a position he assumed in July 2015, after serving as Chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Lowell since September 2007. On May 1, 2015, the University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees unanimously elected Meehan, citing his record of achievement while serving as the Chancellor at UMass Lowell, his record of public service throughout his career, and his ability to communicate and to inspire, as being among the reasons for selecting him as the 27th President of the Massachusetts University System. Meehan is the first former graduate of a UMass school to serve as President of the UMass System. Meehan was inaugurated at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate on November 12, 2015, where he vowed to fight for the University of Massachusetts, calling it \\"the most important institution in Massachusetts in the critical areas of social mobility and economic growth.\\" Meehan made raising money for scholarship funds the centerpiece of his inauguration. With an initial fundraising target of $1 million, the privately funded inauguration far exceeded its goals and generated a record $1.7 million for student scholarships. In his first year of presidency, the University's enrollment reached a record 73,744 students, and research expenditures had risen to a high of $629 million. UMass increased its own funding of financial aid by nearly $20 million during Meehan's first year, with spending rising from $236 million to a record $255 million, the highest ever. Additionally, the UMass Foundation, in part based on Meehan's recommendation, voted to divest direct investments in fossil fuels from the university's endowment, making it the first major public university in the nation to take such action. As Meehan began his second year as President of the UMass System, he announced the closing of his congressional campaign, directed that funds be transferred to an education foundation, and stipulated that a $1 million scholarship donation be made to his alma mater, UMass Lowell. During his years at UMass Lowell, the institution achieved record growth in enrollment, student retention and funding for research and scholarships. During his tenure as chancellor, UMass Lowell for the first time was named a top-tier national university. It also was the top-ranked public research institution in New England for starting salary, mid-career salary and overall return on investment for graduates according to PayScale.com. Under Meehan's leadership, UMass Lowell opened 10 new buildings over a five-year period, was named to the President's Higher Education Honor Roll for community service and campus engagement for six years in a row and made a successful transition to NCAA Division I athletics. Meehan was presented with the Association of College Unions International (ACUI) 2014 President of the Year Award at the organization's 100th anniversary celebration and conference. He was honored by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) at the annual District I program in 2012 with the Chief Executive Leadership Award.  No confidence vote  In May 2018, the faculty council at the University of Massachusetts Boston approved a vote of no confidence for president Meehan and the Board of Trustees based upon the deal for UMass Amherst to purchase Mount Ida College. In a press release, the faculty council asked for a termination of the deal to purchase the Newton college and blamed Meehan and the trustees for having \\"failed to communicate with the faculty, staff and students of the UMass Boston campus regarding such a detrimental plan and [seeking] to prioritize the interest of one campus over the well- being of another campus.\\"  Board appointments  Meehan is on the Board of Trustees at Natixis Global Asset Management and on the Board of Governors at Lowell General Hospital. Previously, he has served on the Board of Directors at Sage Bank (formerly Lowell Cooperative Bank), Qteros (formerly SunEthanol), D'Youville Foundation, and was a member of the Board of Trustees of Suffolk University.  Personal life  In 1996, Meehan married Ellen T. Murphy. They have two children together: Daniel Martin and Robert Francis. The couple divorced in 2016.

The borough's name was derived from the old Broxtowe wapentake of Nottinghamshire, which covered a larger area. The district was granted borough status in 1977. Politics The first elections to the council took place in 1973, with the Conservatives gaining control. The party held power until 1995 when it lost control to the Labour party. From 2003 no party had overall control. After the 2009 elections the Liberal Democrats led the council with Labour support. Following the 2011 elections Labour led the council with Liberal Democrat support, but the Conservatives had the largest representation on the council. In the 2015 elections the Conservatives gained a majority. Wards Since boundary changes in 2015, 44 councillors have been elected from 20 wards.

A Democrat, his district included the northern three-fourths of Boston, as well as parts of Cambridge, his hometown of Somerville, and other communities immediately north and south of Boston. Prior to being elected to Congress, he served as an Alderman and Mayor of Somerville. Capuano was born and raised in Somerville. After graduating from Dartmouth College and Boston College Law School, he worked as an attorney and Somerville alderman. After losing two mayoral elections in 1979 and 1981, he worked as legal counsel for the Massachusetts General Court. In 1989 Capuano ran for mayor a third time and won, serving from 1990 to 1999. In 1998 Capuano won a crowded Democratic primary to replace Joseph Kennedy II in Congress and was re-elected nine times. He represented the state's 8th district until it was redrawn in 2013 into the . In Congress he was a staunch liberal and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He ran in the 2010 special election to fill the seat in the United States Senate made vacant by the death of Ted Kennedy, his Congressional predecessor's uncle, but lost the primary to Martha Coakley, who in turn lost the general election to Republican Scott Brown. In 2018, he was defeated by Ayanna Pressley in a House Democratic primary. In March 2019, Capuano joined the law firm Foley & Lardner, to serve as public affairs director. The same month, he also joined Boston University to teach at the university's Initiative on Cities and help organize the program. Early life and education Capuano was born January 9, 1952 in the Spring Hill neighborhood of Somerville, Massachusetts, the son of Rita Marie (n√©e Garvey) and Andrew Capuano. His father left to serve in World War II shortly after getting married, and after returning ran for the Somerville Board of Aldermen, and became the first Italian American elected to the board. His mother was of Irish descent. Capuano graduated from Somerville High School in 1969, and later attended Dartmouth College, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1973. Capuano later went on to earn his Juris Doctor in 1977 from Boston College Law School, specializing in tax law. Early political career In 1976, Capuano was elected to the Somerville Board of Aldermen representing Ward 5, once served in by his father. Capuano served one term, stepping down in 1979 to run for Mayor of Somerville. In the 1979 mayoral election he faced Eugene Brune, Paul Haley, and incumbent, Thomas August. He lost the nomination to Brune, who went on to defeat August. Capuano ran again in 1981 to challenge Brune, placing second in a three-person runoff election. Capuano promoted his opposition to the state ballot question Proposition 2¬Ω and criticized Brune for expanding the mayoral staff in the face of tight city budgets, while Brune touted his prevention of service cuts after the proposition passed. Capuano lost in the general election with 40% of the vote. From 1978 to 1984 Capuano served as chief legal counsel for the Massachusetts General Court's Joint Committee on Taxation. Capuano left the committee in 1984 to join the Beacon Hill law firm and lobbying group Joyce & Joyce. In 1985 he returned to the Somerville Board of Aldermen as an at-large member. Mayor of Somerville In 1989 Capuano ran for mayor a third time and won. Capuano served as mayor from 1990 to 1999, where he earned a reputation as a hands-on administrator. One of his priorities was to lower the city's population density, which at time was the highest of any New England municipality, by using state grants to demolish several buildings and replace them with playgrounds and parking spaces. As mayor, Capuano oversaw the reduction of school class sizes to a maximum of 19 students. U.S. House of Representatives Capuano with actor and activist George Clooney in Darfur. Elections In 1998, Joseph Kennedy II announced his retirement after six terms in what was then the 8th District. Capuano entered a crowded 10-way Democratic primary‚Äîthe real contest in this heavily Democratic district, which was once represented by John F. Kennedy and Tip O'Neill. The early front-runner was former Boston Mayor and US Vatican Ambassador Raymond Flynn. However, Capuano won the primary with 23%, largely due to large turnout in Somerville, all but assuring him of election in November.Goldberg, Carey (September 16, 1998). \\"Mayor Wins Chance to Take Storied Kennedy House Seat.\\" The New York Times.Ferdinand, Pamela (September 17, 1998). \\"Massachusetts: Ex-Mayor Ray Flynn's Comeback Fizzles; Competitive Race For Governor Set.\\" The Washington Post. He easily won the general election in November, taking 81 percent of the vote. He was reelected nine times, never dropping below 80% of the vote in what has long been the most Democratic district in New England. Since his initial run for the seat, Capuano was unopposed in all but two reelection bids; he faced a minor-party candidate in 2006 and an independent in 2012. He faced a Republican only once, during his initial run in 1998. =2018 election= Capuano was defeated by Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley in the September 4, 2018 primary election. The Boston Globe reported that Capuano did not get the endorsement of either U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren and Edward J. Markey, nor was he endorsed by Representatives Seth Moulton and Niki Tsongas. Capuano did receive the support of the majority of the Massachusetts federal delegation, including Representatives William Keating, Katherine Clark, James McGovern, Joseph Kennedy III, Stephen Lynch, and Richard Neal. Capuano was endorsed by Congressman John Lewis (D-GA), on March 7, 2018; Lewis described Capuano as \\"a champion and fierce advocate for those who have often been forgotten or left behind\\" and \\"a leader alongside those of us opposing the unfair and immoral policies of the Trump Administration.\\" In its editorial endorsement of Pressley, the Boston Globe noted that the state Legislature had drawn the 7th district to favor minority candidates. No Republican even filed, all but assuring Pressley of being the district's next congresswoman. Tenure During his tenure, Capuano helped found five congressional caucuses, on: Community Health Centers; Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities; Sudan; and Korea; as well as one for former Mayors. Capuano voted against the War in Iraq and supported immediate withdrawal of troops. In 2005 Capuano visited Iraq and met with military leaders to assess the future of the region. Capuano is considered to be one of the biggest supporters in Congress for increasing international aid funding, and has advocated bringing attention to the crisis in Sudan and helped secure funding aimed at assisting developing African nations. Capuano is pro-choice and supports open access to abortions. In 2012 a fundraiser hosted by Pope John XXIII High School where Capuano and fellow Massachusetts Congressman Ed Markey were to receive awards was cancelled due to their \\"positions [being] inconsistent with church doctrine;\\" both were humble in response to the news. During the 2010 Senate Democratic primary Capuano criticized his opponent Martha Coakley, claiming she wouldn't have voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with Stupak‚ÄìPitts Amendment which would have barred federal funding of abortions; which Capuano said he only did to \\"keep the health care debate alive.\\" Capuano's comments were characterized by WBUR political analyst as \\"an empty charge against her since he has the same position as she does.\\" After the 2006 election that created a Democratic majority in the House, he was appointed Chairman of the Speaker's Task Force on Ethics Enforcement by Nancy Pelosi, with whom he has a close relationship. After serving as the Chairman of the Task Force on Ethics Enforcement, in 2008 Capuano introduced which established the Office of Congressional Ethics. Capuano has had a long-running relationship with former Congressman Anthony Weiner, whom he shared a Washington, D.C. apartment with for 12 years. Following Weiner's sexting scandal Capuano did not call on him to resign, saying: \\"I am not the guy who likes to judge other people. I figure that is between them and the people who are appropriately named to do that ‚Äì and that is the Ethics Committee.\\" Capuano is a strong supporter of labor rights and unions; in February 2011 during a rally at Beacon Hill in Boston, in support of the 2011 Wisconsin budget protests, Capuano told the crowd, \\"I'm proud to be here with people who understand that it's more than just sending an email to get you going. Every once and awhile you need to get out on the streets and get a little bloody when necessary\\". Following criticism, especially when such a statement was made just days after the attempted assassination of Gabrielle Giffords, Capuano expressed regret for his \\"choice of words.\\" Following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bank bailouts, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing Capuano berated the bank CEOs for their practices, saying at one point: \\"You come to us today on your bicycles after buying Girl Scout cookies and helping out Mother Teresa and telling us, 'We're sorry, we didn't mean it, we won't do it again, trust us.' Well, I have some people in my constituency that actually robbed some of your banks and they say the same thing.\\" Capuano's speech was included in the 2010 documentary film Inside Job, described by director Charles H. Ferguson as being about \\"the systemic corruption of the United States by the financial services industry and the consequences of that systemic corruption.\\" A self-described \\"fiscal conservative\\" who opposed the Bush-era tax cuts that provided tax reductions for the wealthy because they \\"created a deficit for no good reason,\\" in 2013 Capuano joined Senator Elizabeth Warren and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in a rally against the then-upcoming sequester, with Capuano calling it \\"stupid.\\" In 2012 Capuano along with fellow Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank introduced legislation to combine the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission into the \\"Securities and Derivatives Commission.\\" Capuano was a member of the Congressional Arts Caucus and the U.S.-Japan Caucus. Campaigns for higher office=1994 Secretary nomination Capuano ran for Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth in the 1994 election, running against former State Representatives Augusto Grace and William F. Galvin for the Democratic nomination. During the race he framed himself as an advocate for the poor and urban communities, and criticized aid formulas which he argued left less-wealthy municipalities with less per-capita revenue. To appear on the Democratic primary required the support of at least 15% of delegates in the state party convention. In what the Boston Globe deemed \\"an embarrassing defeat,\\" he failed to obtain the necessary delegate votes to be nominated to participate in the primary election, with only 13%. When asked why he undertook the difficult race to begin with, he responded, \\"Because I wasn't ready to run for Governor.\\" 2010 Senate campaign After the death of incumbent Senator Ted Kennedy, a special election to succeed him was scheduled. On September 8, 2009, Capuano collected nomination papers to run for the seat and on September 18, he announced his candidacy. Capuano ran as a \\"Washington insider,\\" comparing himself to Kennedy saying: \\"was [Kennedy] not the ultimate insider ... I think that's probably one of the best things that we share.\\" In his campaign Capuano received several high-profile endorsements, including House Speaker Pelosi and former Massachusetts Governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee, Michael Dukakis. Consistently polling below incumbent Massachusetts Attorney General, Martha Coakley, on December 8, 2009 Capuano lost the Democratic primary to Coakley, winning only 28% of the vote to Coakley's 47%, amongst a field of four candidates. 2014 gubernatorial election Capuano considered running for Governor of Massachusetts in 2014. On January 21, 2013, former Mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts and member of the Massachusetts Governor's Council Michael Albano endorsed Capuano to run, posting on his Facebook page: \\"while the Congressman has not made a decision to compete for the [Democratic] nomination [for Governor] at this time, it is not too early to make the case and encourage his candidacy.\\" When asked in February 2013 whether he might run for governor, Capuano responded: \\"Part of me thinks that some of the more interesting, more important fights over the next several years might be conducted at statehouses around the country and not necessarily on Capitol Hill.\\" In a statement in September 2013, Capuano announced he would not run for governor, and would instead focus on running for re-election to Congress. Personal life Capuano was named after his two grandfathers, and has seven siblings, one of whom died in infancy, and another who died of polio at the age of 5. Capuano married Barbara Teebagy in 1974, and together they have two boys, Michael and Joseph. He is the uncle of actors Chris Evans of the Captain America film series, and Scott Evans of the soap opera One Life to Live. In 2003, the City of Somerville dedicated a new school in Capuano's honor; the Michael E. Capuano Early Childhood Center officially opened in September that year. Capuano is a Roman Catholic. Before Jorge Mario Bergoglio became pope and shifted the tone of the Church, Capuano used to fear that his mother would be embarrassed if he was ever denied communion because of his support for gay marriage and abortion rights.

He is a former U.S. Representative for , serving from 1997 to 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Delahunt did not seek re-election in 2010, and left Congress in January 2011. He was replaced by Norfolk County District Attorney Bill Keating. He is currently an attorney with the firm of Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellott. Early life, education, and early career Born in Quincy, Massachusetts, Delahunt was educated at Thayer Academy, Middlebury College and Boston College Law School and later served as a radarman (RD3) in the United States Coast Guard Reserve. He served a term in the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1973‚Äì75) before serving as district attorney of Norfolk County for more than 20 years. U.S. House of Representatives=Elections In 1996, Democratic Congressman Gerry Studds decided to retire. Delahunt decided to run for Massachusetts's 10th congressional district. On September 17, 1996, Delahunt won the Democratic primary election with a plurality of 38% of the vote. He won the Plymouth County portion of the district, while losing the Norfolk County portion. He narrowly defeated state legislator Philip W Johnston of Marshfield by just 119 votes after a recount, which was conducted in a handful of contested towns. Following the recount, Delahunt sought judicial review in the Massachusetts Superior Court. After reviewing about 900 ballots, Judge Elizabeth B. Donovan declared Delahunt the victor. The case was appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which upheld the lower court ruling. The case is also noteworthy for the issue of \\"hanging chads\\" in punch-card voting machines. On November 5, 1996, Delahunt defeated Republican state Representative Edward B. Teague III 54%-42%. He won re-election six times with at least 32 percentage points. His retirement was confirmed on March 4, 2010, by The Boston Globe. Shortly before the announcement of his retirement, it was discovered that Delahunt, while serving as district attorney for Norfolk County, Massachusetts, had refused to file charges against Amy Bishop for shooting and killing her brother in 1986. On February 12, 2010, Bishop murdered three of her colleagues at the University of Alabama in Huntsville after being denied tenure. Tenure As one of his first initiatives in Congress, he created the bipartisan caucus on the United States Coast Guard, which he co-chaired with two other Coast Guard veterans, Reps. Howard Coble (R-NC) and Gene Taylor (D-MS). This benefited his district through getting the problems of outpaced resources and security recognized at the ports of Massachusetts. In November 2005, he met with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to arrange an assistance program in which Venezuela would supply winter home heating oil at a 40 percent price reduction to thousands of low-income Massachusetts residents. The program, which has since been expanded to help 500,000 people across the U.S., was carried out via the Venezuelan owned Citgo, and brought accusations that Delahunt was assisting an anti-American leader. Delahunt, however, has sometimes criticized Chavez, such as in a September 2006 letter expressing \\"profound disgust\\" at a speech given by Chavez to the United Nations, in which he personally attacked President George W. Bush. In the letter he urged that Chavez express disagreements \\"in a more constructive manner.\\" In the 110th Congress, Delahunt served as Chairman of the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight. He was a consistent opponent of the war in Iraq. However, on March 10, 2010 he voted against a measure to bring troops home from Afghanistan.

Delahunt told the Cape Cod Times that he viewed it as an extension of his work in Congress. As a legislator, he explained, he set policy at a macro level. Now, he said: \\"we're taking that and bringing it down here to the communities, to encourage implementation. We're working with the private sector and the public sector in a way that's a win-win for everyone.\\" He told the Times he is particularly interested in work that encourages regional tourism and economic development.\\" Delahunt portrait Less than two months after leaving Congress, Delahunt lobbied on behalf of the Wampanoag people in Massachusetts to help them secure Indian gaming rights with the state legislature. Delahunt filled a gap left by the Wampanoag's previous lobbyist Jack Abramoff following his conviction associated with the renowned Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. Delahunt received over $15,000 in campaign contributions from the Wampanoag and Abramoff prior to leaving office sparking criticisms from good government advocates and casino opponents. While Delahunt is precluded by law from lobbying the Congress for at least one year, rules do not preclude him from lobbying state legislatures.Tribe hires Bill Delahunt as lobbyist, replaces Abramoff , Plymouth Daily News, March 11, 2011. Delahunt formally announced his retirement from Congress in March 2010. Between March and December 2010, he made over $10,000 in campaign contributions to Massachusetts state legislators from his federal congressional PAC - a 500 percent increase from previous years' contributions.Wampanoag lobbyist Bill Delahunt campaign contributions used federal PAC, WampaLeaks, June 21, 2010. Delahunt has also established a lobbying partnership with the Washington, DC-based Prime Policy Group on ways American companies can establish themselves in foreign countries while helping foreign businesses with connections to in United States markets.Prime Policy Group partners with former congressman Bill Delahunt , Prime Policy Group press release, February 16, 2011. Prime Policy Group's clients include companies like Accenture,Prime Policy Group - Accenture , Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group, January 1, 2010. which have been criticized for moving offshore to avoid paying U.S. taxes. This partnership dovetails with Delahunt's work on behalf of the Wampanoag as their primary backers are the Malaysian gambling giant Genting Group. Genting is seeking to establish a foothold in the United States with ventures in New York, Miami and Massachusetts. The Wampanoag venture, if approved, would give Genting a tax- free foothold in Indian gaming in the United States.Who lobbied for Genting?, Eye on Miami, June 1, 2011. Medical marijuana Delahunt, the President of Medical Marijuana of Massachusetts Inc., has applied for three medical marijuana dispensary licenses from the Massachusetts state Department of Public Health. The businesses would be located in Mashpee, Plymouth and Taunton. The locations would all be in separate counties, so they will not compete with each other in the selection process. Delahunt supports the creation of medical marijuana dispensaries to thwart the rise in prescription drug abuse. He will also be significantly involved in the operations of any of the dispensaries that Medical Marijuana of Massachusetts opens. Harvard Institute of Politics In late May 2017, Delahunt became the acting director of the Harvard Institute of Politics. Personal life Delahunt's paternal grandfather immigrated to the United States from Canada and his paternal grandmother's family was Irish. He and his wife, Katharina E. Delahunt, divorced in 1986. They have one daughter, Kristin, and adopted another, Kara Mai (n√©e Nguyen Mai Tai Trang), from Vietnam in 1975. While Congress was in session, Delahunt lived in a rented house with fellow Democratic politicians George Miller, Chuck Schumer, and Richard Durbin.

It contains some of the earliest hieroglyphic inscriptions ever found. The tablet is thought by some to depict the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the king Narmer. On one side, the king is depicted with the bulbed White Crown of Upper (southern) Egypt, and the other side depicts the king wearing the level Red Crown of Lower (northern) Egypt. Along with the Scorpion Macehead and the Narmer Maceheads, also found together in the Main Deposit at Nekhen, the Narmer Palette provides one of the earliest known depictions of an Egyptian king. The Palette shows many of the classic conventions of Ancient Egyptian art, which must already have been formalized by the time of the Palette's creation.Wilkinson, Toby A.H. Early Dynastic Egypt. p.6 Routledge, London. 1999. The Egyptologist Bob Brier has referred to the Narmer Palette as \\"the first historical document in the world\\".Brier, Bob. Daily Life of the Ancient Egyptians, A. Hoyt Hobbs 1999, p.202 The Palette, which has survived five millennia in almost perfect condition, was discovered by British archeologists James E. Quibell and Frederick W. Green, in what they called the Main Deposit in the Temple of Horus at Nekhen, during the dig season of 1897‚Äì98.The Ancient Egypt Site ‚Äì The Narmer Palette accessed September 19, 2007 Also found at this dig were the Narmer Macehead and the Scorpion Macehead. The exact place and circumstances of these finds were not recorded very clearly by Quibell and Green. In fact, Green's report placed the Palette in a different layer one or two yards away from the deposit, which is considered to be more accurate on the basis of the original excavation notes.Shaw, Ian. Exploring Ancient Egypt. p.33 Oxford University Press, 2003. It has been suggested that these objects were royal donations made to the temple.Bard, Kathryn A. The Emergence of the Egyptian State, in The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt. Ed. Ian Shaw, p.61. Oxford University Press, 2000 Nekhen, or Hierakonpolis, was one of four power centers in Upper Egypt that preceded the consolidation of Upper Egypt at the end of the Naqada III period. Hierakonpolis‚Äôs religious importance continued long after its political role had declined. Palettes were typically used for grinding cosmetics, but this palette is too large and heavy (and elaborate) to have been created for personal use and was probably a ritual or votive object, specifically made for donation to, or use in, a temple. One theory is that it was used to grind cosmetics to adorn the statues of the deities.Brier, Bob.

Description Serekhs bearing the rebus symbols n'r (catfish) and mr (chisel) inside, being the phonetic representation of Narmer's name The Narmer Palette is a , shield-shaped, ceremonial palette, carved from a single piece of flat, soft dark gray-green siltstone. The stone has often been wrongly identified, in the past, as being slate or schist. Slate is layered and prone to flaking, and schist is a metamorphic rock containing large, randomly distributed mineral grains. Both are unlike the finely grained, hard, flake-resistant siltstone, whose source is from a well- attested quarry that has been used since pre-dynastic times at Wadi Hammamat.Shaw, Ian. Ancient Egypt: A Very Short Introduction. pp.44‚Äì45. Oxford University Press, 2004. This material was used extensively during the pre- dynastic period for creating such palettes and also was used as a source for Old Kingdom statuary. A statue of the 2nd dynasty pharaoh Khasekhemwy, found in the same complex as the Narmer Palette at Hierakonpolis, also was made of this material. Early hieroglyphic symbols on the Narmer plate Both sides of the Palette are decorated, carved in raised relief. At the top of both sides are the central serekhs bearing the rebus symbols n'r (catfish) and mr (chisel) inside, being the phonetic representation of Narmer's name.Wengrow, David, The Archaeology of Ancient Egypt Cambridge University Press, p.207 The serekh on each side are flanked by a pair of bovine heads with highly curved horns, thought to represent the cow goddess Bat. She was the patron deity of the seventh nome of Upper Egypt, and was also the deification of the cosmos within Egyptian mythology during the pre-dynastic and Old Kingdom periods of Ancient Egyptian history.Wilkinson, Richard H. The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt, p.172 Thames & Hudson. 2003. The Palette shows the typical Egyptian convention for important figures in painting and reliefs of showing the striding legs and the head in profile, but the torso as from the front. The canon of body proportion based on the \\"fist\\", measured across the knuckles, with 18 fists from the ground to the hairline on the forehead is also already established.Smith, W. Stevenson, and Simpson, William Kelly. The Art and Architecture of Ancient Egypt, pp. 12‚Äì13 and note 17, 3rd edn. 1998, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), Both conventions remained in use until at least the conquest by Alexander the Great some 3,000 years later. The minor figures in active poses, such as the king's captive, the corpses and the handlers of the serpopard beasts, are much more freely depicted. Recto side Narmer Palette (recto) As on the other side, two human-faced bovine heads, thought to represent the patron cow goddess Bat, flank the serekhs. The goddess Bat is, as she often was, shown in portrait, rather than in profile as is traditional in Egyptian relief carving. Hathor, who shared many of Bat's characteristics, is often depicted in a similar manner. Some authors suggest that the images represent the vigor of the king as a pair of bulls. A large picture in the center of the Palette depicts Narmer wielding a mace wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt (whose symbol was the flowering lotus). On the left of the king is a man bearing the king's sandals, flanked by a rosette symbol. To the right of the king is a kneeling prisoner, who is about to be struck by the king. A pair of symbols appear next to his head perhaps indicating his name (Wash) or indicating the region where he was from. Above the prisoner is a falcon, representing Horus, perched above a set of papyrus flowers, the symbol of Lower Egypt. In his talons, he holds a rope-like object which appears to be attached to the nose of a man's head that also emerges from the papyrus flowers, perhaps indicating that he is drawing life from the head. The papyrus has often been interpreted as referring to the marshes of the Nile Delta region in Lower Egypt, or that the battle happened in a marshy area, or even that each papyrus flower represents the number 1,000, indicating that 6,000 enemies were subdued in the battle. Below the king's feet is a third section, depicting two naked, bearded men. They are either running or are meant to be seen as sprawling dead upon the ground. Appearing to the left of the head of each man is a hieroglyphic sign, the first a walled town, the second a type of knot, probably indicating the name of a defeated town. Verso side Narmer Palette (verso) Below the bovine heads is what appears to be a procession. Narmer is depicted at nearly the full height of the register, emphasizing his god-like status in an artistic practice called hierarchic scale, shown wearing the Red Crown of Lower Egypt, whose symbol was the papyrus. He holds a mace and a flail, two traditional symbols of kingship. To his right are the hieroglyphic symbols for his name, though not contained within a serekh. Behind him is his sandal-bearer, whose name may be represented by the rosette appearing adjacent to his head, and a second rectangular symbol that has no clear interpretation, but which has been suggested may represent a town or citadel.Janson, Horst Woldemar; Anthony F. Janson History of Art: A Survey of the Major Visual Arts from the Dawn of History to the Present Day Prentice Hall 1986 p.56 Detail of the Narmar Palette showing a belt with four beaded tassels and a fringe at the back representing a lion's tail. Attached to the belt are four beaded tassels, each capped with an ornament in the shape of the head of the goddess Hathor. They also are the same heads as those that adorn the top of each side of the palette. At the back of the belt is attached a long fringe representing a lion's tail. Immediately in front of the pharaoh is a long-haired man, accompanied by a pair of hieroglyphs that have been interpreted as his name: Tshet (this assumes that these symbols had the same phonetic value used in later hieroglyphic writing). Before this man are four standard bearers, holding aloft an animal skin, a dog, and two falcons. At the far right of this scene are ten decapitated corpses, with heads at their feet, possibly symbolizing the victims of Narmer's conquest. Above them are the symbols for a ship, a falcon, and a harpoon, which has been interpreted as representing the names of the towns that were conquered. Intertwined necks of the serpopards, Mesopotamia, Uruk Period (4100 BC‚Äì3000 BC), Louvre Museum Below the procession, two men are holding ropes tied to the outstretched, intertwining necks of two serpopards confronting each other. The serpopard is a mythological creature whose name is a portmanteau of the words \\"serpent\\" and \\"leopard\\" (although the spotless beast with tufted tail more closely resembles a lioness). The circle formed by their curving necks is the central part of the Palette, which is the area where the cosmetics would have been ground. Upper and Lower Egypt each worshipped lioness war goddesses as protectors; the intertwined necks of the serpopards may thus represent the unification of the state. Similar images of such mythical animals are known from other contemporaneous cultures, and there are other examples of late-predynastic objects (including other palettes and knife handles such as the Gebel el-Arak Knife) which borrow similar elements from Mesopotamian iconography, suggesting Egypt-Mesopotamia relations.Wilkinson, Toby A.H. Early Dynastic Egypt. p.6, Routledge, London. 1999. . At the bottom of the Palette, a bovine image is seen knocking down the walls of a city while trampling on a fallen foe. Because of the lowered head in the image, this is interpreted as a presentation of the king vanquishing his foes, \\"Bull of his Mother\\" being a common epithet given to Egyptian kings as the son of the patron cow goddess.Breasted, James Henry. Ancient Records of Egypt, Chicago 1906, part Two, ¬ß¬ß 143, 659, 853; part Three ¬ß¬ß 117, 144, 147, 285 etc This posture of a bovine has the meaning of \\"force\\" in later hieroglyphics. Scholarly debate The Palette has raised considerable scholarly debate over the years.Hendrickx, Stan, 2017. ‚ÄùNarmer Palette Bibliography‚Äù In general, the arguments fall into one of two camps: scholars who believe that the Palette is a record of an important event, and other academics who argue that it is an object designed to establish the mythology of united rule over Upper and Lower Egypt by the king. It had been thought that the Palette either depicted the unification of Lower Egypt by the king of Upper Egypt, or recorded a recent military success over the Libyans,Shaw, Ian and Nicholson, Paul. The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt. p.197 Harry N. Abrams, Inc. 1995. or the last stronghold of a Lower Egyptian dynasty based in Buto.Wilkinson, Toby A.H. Early Dynastic Egypt. p. 40. Routledge, London. 1999. More recently, scholars such as Nicholas Millet have argued that the Palette does not represent a historical event (such as the unification of Egypt), but instead represents the events of the year in which the object was dedicated to the temple. Whitney Davis has suggested that the iconography on this and other pre-dynastic palettes has more to do with establishing the king as a visual metaphor of the conquering hunter, caught in the moment of delivering a mortal blow to his enemies.Shaw, Ian. & Nicholson, Paul. The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, pp. 196‚Äì197. The British Museum Press, 1995. John Baines has suggested that the events portrayed are \\"tokens of royal achievement\\" from the past and that \\"the chief purpose of the piece is not to record an event but to assert that the king dominates the ordered world in the name of the gods and has defeated internal, and especially external, forces of disorder\\".Baines, John \\"Communication and display: the integration of early Egyptian art and writing\\" Antiquity, vol. 63:240, 1989, pp. 471‚Äì482. In popular culture The Narmer Palette is featured in the 2009 film Watchmen. The Australian author Jackie French used the Palette, and recent research into Sumerian trade routes, to create her historical novel Pharaoh (2007). The Palette is featured in manga artist Yukinobu Hoshino's short story \\"The temple of El Alamein\\". The Palette is also featured in The Kane Chronicles by Rick Riordan where the palette is fetched by a magical shwabati servant. In Ubisoft‚Äôs 2017 release of Assassins Creed: Origins, the Palette is a quest item and minor plot point toward the end of the main quests storyline.

He pioneered infrared and ultraviolet photography. Wood's patents and theoretical work inform modern understanding of the physics of ultraviolet light, and made possible myriad uses of UV fluorescence which became popular after World War I.Wood, Robert W. (13 July 1920). \\"Flash-telescope.\\" . Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.Wood, Robert W. (22 May 1923). \\"Optical Method.\\" .

He published many articles on spectroscopy, phosphorescence, diffraction, and ultraviolet light.  Early life and education  Born in Concord, Massachusetts, Wood attended The Roxbury Latin School with the initial intent of becoming a priest. However, he decided to study optics instead when he witnessed a rare glowing aurora one night and believed the effect to be caused by \\"invisible rays\\". In his pursuit to find these \\"invisible rays\\", Wood studied and earned several degrees in physics from Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Chicago. From 1894 to 1896, he worked with Heinrich Rubens at the Berlin University.  Career  The Clover and the Plover, illustration and verse from How to Tell the Birds from the Flowers (1907). See nature fakers controversy Wood returned to the US, where he taught briefly at the University of Wisconsin and eventually became a full-time professor of \\"optical physics\\" at Johns Hopkins University from 1901 until his death. He worked closely with Alfred Lee Loomis at Tuxedo Park, New York. In 1903 he developed a filter, Wood's glass, that was opaque to visible light but transparent to both ultraviolet and infrared, and is used in modern-day black lights. He used it for ultraviolet photography but also suggested its use for secret communication. He was also the first person to photograph ultraviolet fluorescence. He also developed an ultraviolet lamp, which is widely known as the Wood's lamp in medicine. The slightly surreal glowing appearance of foliage in infrared photographs is called the Wood effect. In 1904, Wood disproved the existence of so-called N-rays. The French physicist Prosper-Ren√© Blondlot claimed to have discovered a new form of radiation similar to X-rays, which he named N-rays. Some physicists reported having successfully reproduced his experiments; others reported that they had failed to observe the phenomenon. Visiting Blondlot's laboratory at the behest of the journal Nature, Wood surreptitiously removed an essential prism from Blondlot's apparatus during a demonstration. The alleged effect was still reported, showing that N-rays had been self-deception on Blondlot's part. Quote: \\"After spending three hours or more in witnessing various experiments, I am not only unable to report a single observation which appeared to indicate the existence of the rays, but left with a very firm conviction that the few experimenters who have obtained positive results, have been in some way deluded. A somewhat detailed report of the experiments which were shown to me, together with my own observations, may be of interest to the many physicists who have spent days and weeks in fruitless efforts to repeat the remarkable experiments which have been described in the scientific journals of the past year.\\" Wood identified an area of very low ultraviolet albedo (an area where most of the ultraviolet was absorbed) in the Aristarchus Plateau region of the Moon, which he suggested was due to high sulfur content. The area continues to be called Wood's Spot. In 1909, Wood constructed the first practical liquid mirror astronomical telescope, by spinning mercury to form a paraboloidal shape, and investigated its benefits and limitations. Wood has been described as the \\"father of both infrared and ultraviolet photography\\". Though the discovery of electromagnetic radiation beyond the visible spectrum and the development of photographic emulsions capable of recording them predate Wood, he was the first to intentionally produce photographs with both infrared and ultraviolet radiation.Seabrook (1941) Wood took part in the investigation of several crimes, including the Wall Street bombing. Wood also authored nontechnical works. In 1915, Wood co-wrote a science fiction novel, The Man Who Rocked the Earth, along with Arthur Train.Train & Wood (1915) Its sequel, The Moon Maker, was published the next year.Train & Wood (1916) Wood also wrote and illustrated two books of children's verse, How to Tell the Birds from the Flowers (1907), and Animal Analogues (1908).  Personal life  Wood married Gertrude Hooper Ames in 1892 in San Francisco. She was the daughter of Pelham Warren and Augusta Hooper (Wood) Ames, and the granddaughter of William Northey Hooper and the Massachusetts Supreme Court justice Seth Ames. Robert Wood died in Amityville, New York.[Anon.] (1980) Contributions to ultrasound Photographs of sound waves (generated by sparks) and their reflections Sketches of wavefronts observed from photographs Although physical optics and spectroscopy were Wood's main areas of study, he made substantial contributions to the field of ultrasound as well. His main contributions were photographing sound waves and investigating high-power ultrasonics. Photography of sound waves His first contribution to the field of ultrasonics was the photography of sound waves. Wood's primary research area was physical optics, but he found himself confronted with the problem of demonstrating to his students the wave nature of light without resorting to mathematical abstractions which they found confusing. He therefore resolved to photograph the sound waves given off by an electric spark as an analogy to light waves. An electric spark was used because it produces not a wave train, but a single wavefront, making it much more intuitive to study and visualize. Although this method was first discovered by August Toepler, Wood did more-detailed studies of the shock waves and their reflections.Krehl, P. & Engemann, S. (1995) \\"Toepler, August - The First Who Visualized Shock-waves.\\" Shock waves, 5: 1-2, 1-18 High- powered ultrasound After these early contributions Wood returned to physical optics, setting aside his interest in \\"supersonics\\" for quite some time. With the entry of the United States into World War I, Wood was asked to help with the war effort. He decided to work with Paul Langevin, who was investigating ultrasound as a method for detecting submarines. While in Langevin's lab, he observed that high-powered ultrasonic waves can cause the formation of air bubbles in water, and that fish would be killed or an experimenter's hand would suffer searing pain if placed in the path of an intense sound beam. All of these observations piqued his interest in high- powered ultrasound. In 1926, Wood recounted Langevin's experiments to Alfred Lee Loomis, and the two of them collaborated on high intensity ultrasound experiments; this turned out to be Wood's primary contribution to the field of ultrasonics. The experimental setup was driven by a two kW oscillator that had been designed for a furnace, allowing for the generation of very high output power. The frequencies they used ran from 100 to 700 kHz.Wood, R. W. & Loomis, A. L. (1927) \\"The physical and biological effects of high-frequency sound- waves of great intensity.\\" Philosophical Magazine Series 7. 4(22): 416-436. When the quartz plate transducer was suspended in oil, it would raise a mound of oil up to higher than the rest of the surface of the oil. At lower powers, the mound was low and lumpy; at high powers, it would rise up to the full 7 cm, \\"its summit erupting oil drops like a miniature volcano\\". The airborne oil drops could reach heights of . Similarly, when an diameter glass plate was placed on the surface of the oil, up to of external weight could be placed on top of the glass plate, supported by the strength of the ultrasound waves alone. This was achieved by the waves reflecting and re-reflecting between the transducer and the glass plate, allowing each generated wave to impart its force to the glass plate multiple times. When attempting to take the temperature of the mound of erupting oil with a glass thermometer, Wood and Loomis accidentally discovered another set of effects. They noted that although the mercury in the thermometer only indicated , the glass felt so hot that it was painful to touch, and they noticed that the pain became unbearable if they tried to squeeze the thermometer tightly. Even if very fine thread of glass only in diameter and long was put in the oil at one end, holding a bulge in the glass at the other end still resulted in a groove being left in the skin and the skin being seared, with painful and bloody blisters forming that lasted several weeks, showing that the transmitted ultrasound vibrations generated were quite powerful. When a vibrating glass rod was placed lightly in contact with dried woodchips, the rod would burn the wood and cause it to smoke; when pressed against a woodchip it would quickly burn through the chip, leaving behind a charred hole. All the while the glass rod remained cool, with the heating confined to the tip. When a glass rod was pressed lightly against a glass plate it etched the surface, while if pressed harder it bored right through the plate. Microscopic examinations showed that the debris given off included finely powdered glass and globules of molten glass. Wood and Loomis also investigated heating liquids and solids internally using high intensity ultrasound. While the heating of liquids was relatively straightforward, they were also able to heat an ice cube such that the center melted before the outside. The ability to heat or damage objects internally is now the basis of modern therapeutic ultrasound. Turning their attention to the effects of high- intensity ultrasound on living matter, Wood and Loomis observed ultrasound tearing fragile bodies to pieces. Cells were generally torn apart at sufficiently high exposure, although very small ones like bacteria managed to avoid destruction. Frogs, mice, or small fish were killed after one to two minutes of exposure, replicating Langevin's earlier observation. Wood and Loomis also investigated the formation of emulsions and fogs, crystallization and nucleation, chemical reactions, interference patterns, and standing waves in solids and liquids under high-intensity ultrasound. After completing this broad array of experiments, Wood returned to optics and did not return to ultrasonic work. Loomis would go on to advance the science further with other collaborators.Graff, K.

Best known for his scenes of the Civil War, he studied under inventor Samuel F. B. Morse, who pioneered the daguerreotype technique in America. Brady opened his own studio in New York in 1844, and photographed Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and Abraham Lincoln, among other public figures. When the Civil War started, his use of a mobile studio and darkroom enabled vivid battlefield photographs that brought home the reality of war to the public. Thousands of war scenes were captured, as well as portraits of generals and politicians on both sides of the conflict, though most of these were taken by his assistants, rather than by Brady himself. After the war, these pictures went out of fashion, and the government did not purchase the master-copies as he had anticipated. Brady's fortunes declined sharply, and he died in debt. Early life Lithograph of Brady, Brady left little record of his life before photography. Speaking to the press in the last years of his life, he stated that he was born between 1822 and 1824 in Warren County, New York, near Lake George. He was the youngest of three children to Irish immigrant parents, Andrew and Samantha Julia Brady. In official documents before and during the war, however, he claimed to have been born himself in Ireland. Career At age 16, Brady moved to Saratoga, New York, where he met portrait painter William Page and became Page's student. In 1839, the two traveled to Albany, New York, and then to New York City, where Brady continued to study painting with Page, and also with Page's former teacher, Samuel F. B. Morse. Morse had met Louis Jacques Daguerre in France in 1839, and returned to the US to enthusiastically push the new daguerreotype invention of capturing images. At first, Brady's involvement was limited to manufacturing leather cases that held daguerreotypes. But soon he became the center of the New York artistic colony that wished to study photography. Morse opened a studio and offered classes; Brady was one of the first students.The tuition was fifty dollars, which Brady earned by working as a clerk for department store tycoon Alexander Turney Stewart. In 1844, Brady opened his own photography studio at the corner of Broadway and Fulton Street in New York, and by 1845, he began to exhibit his portraits of famous Americans, including the likes of Senator Daniel Webster and poet Edgar Allan Poe. In 1849, he opened a studio at 625 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., where he met Juliet (whom everybody called 'Julia') Handy, whom he married in 1850 and lived with on Staten Island.The couple had no children, but lavished their attention on Julia's nephew, Levin Handy, who would continue to run Brady's studio until after Brady's death.Wilson, Robert. Mathew Brady: Portraits of a Nation Bloomsbury, 2014, pp. 27, 117, 241 Brady's early images were daguerreotypes, and he won many awards for his work; in the 1850s ambrotype photography became popular, which gave way to the albumen print, a paper photograph produced from large glass negatives most commonly used in the American Civil War photography. In 1850, Brady produced The Gallery of Illustrious Americans, a portrait collection of prominent contemporary figures. The album, which featured noteworthy images including the elderly Andrew Jackson at the Hermitage, was not financially rewarding but invited increased attention to Brady's work and artistry. In 1854, Parisian photographer Andr√©-Adolphe-Eug√®ne Disd√©ri popularized the carte de visite and these small pictures (the size of a visiting card) rapidly became a popular novelty; thousands were created and sold in the United States and Europe. In 1856, Brady placed an ad in the New York Herald offering to produce \\"photographs, ambrotypes and daguerreotypes.\\" This inventive ad pioneered, in the US, the use of typeface and fonts that were distinct from the text of the publication and from that of other advertisements.Emergence of Advertising in America, 1850‚Äì1920 ‚Äì Duke Libraries . Library.duke.edu (March 16, 2010). Retrieved September 2, 2011 Civil War documentation Portrait of Brady by Charles Loring Elliott, 1857 Brady, upon his return from the First Battle of Bull RunUnder the long coat, he is wearing a saber awarded to him by the New York Fire Zouaves. Although Brady was photographed wearing a sword under his linen duster and claimed to have received the weapon at First Bull Run from the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment‚Äîsee Miller's Photographic History of the Civil War Vol 1 p. 31‚Äîthere is doubt as to whether he took pictures at the battle. See Frassantito's Antietam. Picture of alleged \\"Confederate dead on Matthews Hill, Bull Run\\" Brady Handy Collection Pickets cooking their rations. Reserve picket fort near Fredericksburg, December 9, 1862 At first, the effect of the Civil War on Brady's business was a brisk increase in sales of cartes de visite to departing soldiers. Brady readily marketed to parents the idea of capturing their young soldiers' images before they might be lost to war by running an ad in The New York Daily Tribune that warned, \\"You cannot tell how soon it may be too late.\\" However, he was soon taken with the idea of documenting the war itself. He first applied to an old friend, General Winfield Scott, for permission to have his photographers travel to the battle sites, and eventually, he made his application to President Lincoln himself. Lincoln granted permission in 1861, with the proviso that Brady finance the project himself. His efforts to document the American Civil War on a grand scale by bringing his photographic studio onto the battlefields earned Brady his place in history. Despite the dangers, financial risk, and discouragement by his friends, Brady was later quoted as saying \\"I had to go. A spirit in my feet said 'Go,' and I went.\\" His first popular photographs of the conflict were at the First Battle of Bull Run, in which he got so close to the action that he barely avoided capture. While most of the time the battle had ceased before pictures were taken, Brady came under direct fire at the First Battle of Bull Run, Petersburg, and Fredericksburg. He also employed Alexander Gardner, James Gardner, Timothy H. O'Sullivan, William Pywell, George N. Barnard, Thomas C. Roche, and seventeen other men, each of whom was given a traveling darkroom, to go out and photograph scenes from the Civil War. Brady generally stayed in Washington, D.C., organizing his assistants and rarely visited battlefields personally. However, as author Roy Meredith points out, \\"He [Brady] was essentially the director. The actual operation of the camera though mechanical is important, but the selection of the scene to be photographed is as important, if not more so than just 'snapping the shutter.'\\" This may have been due, at least in part, to the fact that Brady's eyesight had begun to deteriorate in the 1850s. Many of the images in Brady's collection are, in reality, thought to be the work of his assistants. Brady was criticized for failing to document the work, though it is unclear whether it was intentional or due simply to a lack of inclination to document the photographer of a specific image. Because so much of Brady's photography is missing information, it is difficult to know not only who took the picture, but also exactly when or where it was taken. In October 1862 Brady opened an exhibition of photographs from the Battle of Antietam in his New York gallery, titled The Dead of Antietam. Many images in this presentation were graphic photographs of corpses, a presentation new to America. This was the first time that many Americans saw the realities of war in photographs, as distinct from previous \\"artists' impressions\\". Mathew Brady, through his many paid assistants, took thousands of photos of American Civil War scenes. Much of the popular understanding of the Civil War comes from these photos. There are thousands of photos in the US National Archives and the Library of Congress taken by Brady and his associates, Alexander Gardner, George Barnard and Timothy O'Sullivan. The photographs include Lincoln, Grant, and soldiers in camps and battlefields. The images provide a pictorial cross reference of American Civil War history. Brady was not able to photograph actual battle scenes, as the photographic equipment in those days was still in the infancy of its technical development and required that a subject be still for a clear photo to be produced. Following the conflict, a war-weary public lost interest in seeing photos of the war, and Brady's popularity and practice declined drastically. Later years and death During the war, Brady spent over $100,000 to create over 10,000 plates. He expected the US government to buy the photographs when the war ended. When the government refused to do so he was forced to sell his New York City studio and go into bankruptcy. Congress granted Brady $25,000 in 1875, but he remained deeply in debt. The public was unwilling to dwell on the gruesomeness of the war after it had ended, and so private collectors were scarce. Depressed by his financial situation and loss of eyesight, and devastated by the death of his wife in 1887, he died penniless in the charity ward of Presbyterian Hospital in New York City on January 15, 1896, from complications following a streetcar accident. Brady's funeral was financed by veterans of the 7th New York Infantry. He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery, which is located in Barney Circle, a neighborhood in the Southeast quadrant of Washington, D.C. Levin Corbin Handy, Brady's nephew by marriage, took over Brady's photography business after his death. Ironically although Brady's own account admitted that he was unable to take any pictures at First Bull Run, One picture in the collection was titled: \\"Confederate Deaths at Matthews Hill\\". There are doubts that the picture was taken 1861 by Brady; the \\"dead\\" soldiers were found to be very much alive in a pictureSee William Frassanito's \\"Antietam\\" pp.30-31 Likewise a picture of the same soldiers in greatcoats was identified as being taken in 1862! (90 cents, issue of 1869) based on a Brady portrait photo. Legacy Brady photographed 18 of the 19 American presidents from John Quincy Adams to William McKinley. The exception was the 9th President, William Henry Harrison, who died in office three years before Brady started his photographic collection. Brady photographed Abraham Lincoln on many occasions. His Lincoln photographs have been used for the $5 bill and the Lincoln penny. One of his Lincoln photos was used by the National Bank Note Company as a model for the engraving on the 90c Lincoln Postage issue of 1869.Smithsonian National Postal Museum. Arago.si.edu (May 16, 2006). Retrieved September 2, 2011 The thousands of photographs which Mathew Brady's photographers (such as Alexander Gardner and Timothy O'Sullivan) took have become the most important visual documentation of the Civil War, and have helped historians and the public better understand the era. Brady photographed and made portraits of many senior Union officers in the war, including: * Ulysses S. Grant * Nathaniel Banks * Don Carlos Buell * Ambrose Burnside * Benjamin Butler * Joshua Chamberlain * George Custer * David Farragut * John Gibbon * Winfield Hancock * Samuel P. Heintzelman * Joseph Hooker * Oliver Otis Howard * David Hunter * John A. Logan * Irvin McDowell * George McClellan * James McPherson * George Meade * Montgomery C. Meigs * David Dixon Porter * William Rosecrans * John Schofield * William Sherman * Daniel Sickles * Henry Warner Slocum * George Stoneman * Edwin V. Sumner * George Thomas * Emory Upton * James Wadsworth * Lew Wallace On the Confederate side, Brady photographed: Jefferson Davis, P. G. T. Beauregard, Stonewall Jackson, Albert Pike, James Longstreet, James Henry Hammond, Henry Hopkins Sibley, and Robert E. Lee.Lee's first session with Brady was in 1845 as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, his final after the war in Richmond, Virginia. Brady also photographed Lord Lyons, the British ambassador to Washington during the Civil War. Photojournalism and honors Brady is credited with being the father of photojournalism. He can also be considered a pioneer in the orchestration of a \\"corporate credit line.\\" In this practice, every image produced in his gallery was labeled \\"Photo by Brady\\"; however, Brady dealt directly with only the most distinguished subjects and most portrait sessions were carried out by others. As perhaps the best-known US photographer in the 19th century, it was Brady's name that came to be attached to the era's heavy specialized end tables which were factory-made specifically for use by portrait photographers. Such a \\"Brady stand\\" of the mid-19th century typically had a weighty cast iron base for stability, plus an adjustable-height single-column pipe leg for dual use as either a portrait model's armrest or (when fully extended and fitted with a brace attachment rather than the usual tabletop) as a neck rest. The latter was often needed to keep models steady during the longer exposure times of early photography. While Brady stand is a convenient term for these trade- specific articles of studio equipment, there is no proven connection between Brady himself and the Brady stand's invention circa 1855.Macy, et al., \\"Macy Photographic Studio's Dispatch, The\\", Northampton MA, Spring‚ÄìSummer 1913, pp. 2‚Äì3 In 2013, Brady Street in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was officially renamed \\"Mathew Brady Street.\\" The original namesake Brady was W. Tate Brady, a prominent businessman in Tulsa's early history, who had connections to the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations. Following considerable controversy, the City Council of Tulsa, OK on August 15, 2013, voted to retain the name Brady for the street, but that it would now refer to and honor Mathew B. Brady instead. Mathew Brady never visited Tulsa in his lifetime. Books and documentaries Brady and his Studio produced over 7,000 pictures (mostly two negatives of each). One set \\"after undergoing extraordinary vicissitudes,\\" came into U.S. government possession. His own negatives passed in the 1870s to E. & H. T. Anthony & Company of New York, in default of payment for photographic supplies. They \\"were kicked about from pillar to post\\" for 10 years, until John C. Taylor found them in an attic and bought them; from this they became \\"the backbone of the Ordway‚ÄìRand collection; and in 1895 Brady himself had no idea of what had become of them. Many were broken, lost, or destroyed by fire. After passing to various other owners, they were discovered and appreciated by Edward Bailey Eaton,\\" who set in motion \\"events that led to their importance as the nucleus of a collection of Civil War photos published in 1912 as The Photographic History of the Civil War.\\"The Photographic History of the Civil War, in Ten Volumes\\", Francis Trevelyan Miller, editor-in-chief, and Robert S. Lanier, Managing Editor, The Review of Reviews Co., New York, 1912, p. 52 Some of the lost images are mentioned in the last episode of Ken Burns' 1990 documentary on the Civil War. Burns claims that glass plate negatives were often sold to gardeners, not for their images, but for the glass itself to be used in greenhouses and cold frames. In the years that followed the end of the war, the sun slowly burned away their filmy images and they were lost.Kinship of the soul ‚Äì 1993 Commencement address by filmmaker Ken Burns, University of Delaware Messenger.

He was the chairman and CEO for Europe and Asia of News Corporation until 2013 when it was split into News Corp and 21st Century Fox. He was formerly a director of News Corp and was a member of the office of the chairman. Until April 2012, he was the chairman and CEO of Sky plc, Europe and Asia, where he oversaw assets such as News International (British newspapers; publisher of The News of the World newspaper), Sky Italia (satellite television in Italy), Sky Deutschland, and STAR TV (satellite television in Asia). He was executive chairman of News International from 2007 until February 2012. He previously held a non- executive chair at British Sky Broadcasting, in which News Corp has a controlling minority stake. In April 2012, he was forced to resign as chairman of BSkyB in the wake of the ongoing phone hacking scandal, in which he was implicated.Murdoch steps down as BSkyB chairman Dan Sabbagh, 3 April 2012, The Guardian (London) He was reappointed chairman of the company following its merger with its Italian and German sister companies to form Sky plc. He was formerly an executive vice-president of News Corporation (the controlling shareholder of BSkyB) and served on the board of directors of News Datacom and of News Corporation. In May 2012, a highly critical UK Parliamentary report said that Murdoch \\"showed wilful ignorance of the extent of phone-hacking\\" and found him \\"guilty of an astonishing lack of curiosity\\" over the issue. It went on to say that both Murdoch and his father, Rupert, \\"should ultimately be prepared to take responsibility\\" for wrongdoing at the News of the World and News International.Culture, Media and Sport Committee, 11th report, News International and phone-hacking SMS Select Committee Report, phone-hacking, May 2012 Murdoch is a British citizen by birth and a naturalised US citizen. He lost Australian citizenship when his father became a US citizen, but he is eligible to reclaim it. Early life Murdoch was born in Wimbledon, London, England. He is the fourth child of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch's six children, and the third with Scottish-born journalist and author Anna Murdoch Mann (n√©e Torv). As a youngster James was regarded as the brightest of the Murdoch children, but also considered something of a rebel. He first came to public notice as a 15-year-old intern at the Sydney Daily Mirror but made headlines in the rival The Sydney Morning Herald after he was photographed asleep on a sofa at a press conference. Murdoch attended Horace Mann School in New York City and graduated in 1991. He then studied film and history at Harvard University, where he was a member of the Harvard Lampoon. He dropped out of university in 1995 without completing his studies. With university friends Brian Brater and Jarret Myer, he backed the establishment of Rawkus Records, an independent hip hop record label. The company was bought by News Corporation in 1998. Business career In 1996 Murdoch joined News Corporation and was appointed chairman of Festival Records. He took charge of News Corporation's internet operations, where he invested in a series of ventures, including financial website TheStreet and the short-lived online music site Whammo, with mixed results. He also continued to contribute cartoons to US magazine Gear. He is credited with sparking his father's interest in the internet, and he reportedly tried to persuade his father to buy internet company Pointcast for US$450 million. It was subsequently sold to another company for $7 million. After installing a new management team at Festival, Murdoch purchased the controlling 51% share of Mushroom Records in 1999, and the merged group was rebranded as Festival Mushroom Records (FMR). It was at first thought that News Corporation might use FMR as the foundation of a new international entertainment company, but FMR struggled while Murdoch was in charge and after his departure its fortunes declined rapidly. FMR was closed in late 2005 and its remaining assets were sold: the recording catalogue was sold to the Australian division of Warner Music for A$10 million in October 2005, and the publishing division was sold to Michael Gudinski a month later, for an undisclosed sum. In May 2000, Murdoch was appointed chairman and chief executive of News Corporation's ailing Asian satellite service Star Television, which at the time was losing ¬£100 million a year, and he moved to Hong Kong. In February 2003, Murdoch became a director of BSkyB. Later that year, he controversially became CEO of BSkyB, in which News Corporation owns a controlling minority stake. His appointment sparked accusations of nepotism, with some commentators and shareholders feeling that the job had not been opened to outsiders and that Murdoch was too young and inexperienced to run one of the UK's top companies (upon appointment he was by far the youngest chief executive of a FTSE 100 company). Following the surprise resignation of his brother Lachlan Murdoch from his executive positions at News Corporation in July 2005, James was viewed as his father's heir-apparent.James Robinson \\"James Murdoch hits out at BBC and regulators at Edinburgh TV festival\\", The Guardian, 28 August 2009 Murdoch at a digital media conference in 2006 In December 2007, Murdoch stepped down as CEO from BSkyB and was appointed non-executive chairman of the company (a position formerly held by his father, Rupert). In a related announcement, Murdoch also took \\"direct responsibility for the strategic and operational development of News Corporation's television, newspaper, and related digital assets in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\\" This included holdings such as News International, SKY Italia, STAR Group ltd and possibly other News Corporation related assets. He was based at News International's headquarters in Wapping, East London. In February 2009, Murdoch was appointed a non-executive director with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. In August 2009, Murdoch delivered the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, in which he attacked the BBC and UK media regulator Ofcom calling the BBC's expansion \\"chilling\\" and also said: \\"In this all-media marketplace, the expansion of state-sponsored journalism is a threat to the plurality and independence of news provision, which are so important for our democracy.\\"Murdoch's Son: BBC Expansion Is \\"Chilling,\\" A Threat To Independent Journalism. The Huffington Post. 29 August 2009. The BBC chairman, Sir Michael Lyons officially responded, \\"We have to be careful not to reduce the whole of broadcasting to some simple economic transactions. The BBC's public purposes stress the importance of the well-tested principles of educating and informing, and an impartial contribution to debate in the UK.\\" In April 2010, Murdoch and his associate Rebekah Brooks entered the offices of The Independent to complain about an advertisement campaign by the newspaper. The advertisement read, \\"Rupert Murdoch won't decide this election‚Äîyou will.\\" In April 2014, it was announced that Murdoch would join the board of advertising start-up True[X] Media. In June 2015, his father, Rupert, announced Rupert would be leaving his position as CEO of 21st Century Fox and James would take over the position. In January 2016, Murdoch became the chairman of Sky, Britain's subscription broadcaster. In July 2017, Murdoch became an independent director on the board of Tesla. In October 2018, Murdoch left Sky after Comcast took the majority control of the company. In March 2019, 21st Century Fox was sold to The Walt Disney Company, ending Murdoch's tenure as CEO. In July 2020, Murdoch resigned from the board of directors of News Corp. His resignation letter stated that his resignation was \\"due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company‚Äôs news outlets and certain other strategic decisions\\". Phone hacking scandal and aftermath On 7 July 2011, James Murdoch announced the closure of the British tabloid newspaper the News of the World in the wake of a phone hacking scandal. On 19 July 2011, along with his father, Rupert, he appeared at a hearing of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee. He appeared once again before the same committee on 10 November 2011. James maintained that until late in 2010 he was unaware that more than one \\"rogue reporter\\" from the News of the World tabloid had been involved in phone hacking. This statement was challenged by the formal legal manager and editor for the newspaper, who claimed they had informed James of the \\"Transcript for Neville\\" email, a potential \\"smoking gun\\" indicating several of the newspaper's journalists may have been involved, during the settlement negotiations with Gorden Taylor in 2008 and alerted him to the potential liability if this document became public. On 22 July 2011, Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, said that Murdoch has \\"questions to answer in Parliament,\\" a day after former top executives of the News of the World accused the News Corporation executive of giving \\"mistaken\\" evidence. In November 2011, British newspapers reported that Murdoch had resigned as chairman of News Group Newspapers, the holding company above The Sun, News of the World and Times Newspapers Ltd, itself owner of The Times and The Sunday Times. News Group Newspapers is the company subject to a series of lawsuits, all related to the phone hacking scandal. James Murdoch's resignation was also said to be related to the 12 October 2011 resignation of another Dow Jones executive, Andrew Langhoff, after a company whistleblower revealed an editorial scam and questionable circulation dealings at The Wall Street Journal Europe. In February 2012, News Corp announced that Murdoch would be stepping down as executive chairman of its British newspaper arm. The company said he would remain deputy chief operating officer of News Corp and focus on the company's international TV business,\\"James Murdoch resigns from News International\\", The Associated Press via CBCnews, 29 February 2012.

Personal life Murdoch married Kathryn Hufschmid Murdoch in 2000; the couple have three children, Anneka (born 2003), Walter (born 2004), and Emerson (born 2008). Kathryn works for the Clinton Climate Initiative, a charitable foundation set up by the former U.S. President, Bill Clinton in 2006. In 2013, the couple launched Quadrivium Foundation.

It usually denotes a helicopter operated by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) \\"Nighthawks\\", consisting of either the large Sikorsky VH-3D Sea King or the newer, smaller VH-60N \\"White Hawk\\". Both helicopters are called \\"White Tops\\" because of their livery. Any Marine Corps aircraft carrying the vice president has the call sign Marine Two.  History  The first use of a helicopter to transport the president was in 1957, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower traveled on a Bell UH-13J Sioux. The president wanted a quick way to reach his summer home, in Pennsylvania. Using Air Force One would have been impractical over such a short distance, and there was no airfield near his home with a paved runway to support fixed-wing aircraft, so Eisenhower instructed his staff to investigate other modes of transport and a Sikorsky UH-34 Seahorse helicopter was commissioned. The early aircraft lacked the amenities of its modern successors, such as air conditioning and toilets for use in flight. A former Marine One at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library In 1958, the H-13 was replaced by the Sikorsky H-34, which was succeeded in 1961 by the VH-3A. Not long after helicopters for presidential transport were introduced, presidential aides asked the Marine Corps to investigate using the White House South Lawn for landing. There was ample room, and the protocol was established. Until 1976, the Marine Corps shared the responsibility of helicopter transportation for the president with the United States Army. Army helicopters used the call sign Army One while the president was on board. President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan board Marine One, 1987 The VH-3D entered service in 1978. The VH-60N entered service in 1987 and has served alongside the VH-3D.\\"VH-71 Officially Dead.\\" AIR International, 4 June 2009. Accessed 9 September 2013. Improvements were made to both models of helicopter after their introduction, to take advantage of technological developments and to meet new mission requirements. By about 2001, it was clear that so much extra weight had been added to the helicopters that mission capability was reduced and few new improvements could be made.GAO-11-380R, \\"Defense Acquisitions: Application of Lessons Learned and Best Practices in the Presidential Helicopter Program\\", p. 2. Government Accountability Office. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 25 March 2011. Accessed 9 September 2013. By 2009, there were 11 VH-3Ds and eight VH-60Ns in service for the president and other important persons. On 16 July 2009, Marine One flew with an all female crew for the first time. This was also the final flight of Major Jennifer Grieves, who was the first woman pilot to fly the president. Inside a VH-3D Marine One transporting President Barack Obama (seated with back to camera) As of 2009, Marine One had never had an accident or been attacked. However, in 2006, President George W. Bush boarded Marine One with his departing press secretary, but the helicopter \\"would not work\\", so the president left the White House in a car.  Replacement  The September 11 attacks on the United States led to widespread agreement that the Marine One helicopter fleet needed significant upgrades to its communication, transportation, and security systems. But weight limitations prevented the changes. In April 2002, the Department of Defense began the VXX program, which assigned the U.S. Navy to design new presidential helicopters by 2011.Aitoro, Jill R. \\"Failed Helicopter Program, Revisited.\\" Washington Business Journal, 28 March 2011. Accessed 9 September 2013. In November 2002, the White House asked the Secretary of Defense to accelerate the development of the new aircraft; the Defense Department said a new helicopter would be ready by the end of 2008, and asked companies bidding on the project to begin development and production simultaneously. Many specifications for the new aircraft were secret. Industry publications and testimony at congressional briefings revealed that it was to be long, carry 14 passengers, be able to carry several thousand pounds of baggage and gear, and have a range greater than those of the VH-3D and the VH-60N. The helicopter's defenses were to include radar jamming and deception, to ward off anti-aircraft missiles; protection of key electronics against nuclear electromagnetic pulse; and an encrypted telecommunications system and videoconferencing. The only competitors for the contact were Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky Aircraft. Lockheed joined with AgustaWestland, a British and Italian aircraft company, to offer a version of the AgustaWestland AW101. Sikorsky proposed using its S-92.\\"Obama Mulls Chopping Costs On Helicopter Fleet\\". Agence-France Presse, 24 February 2009. Accessed 9 September 2013. The Navy awarded the contract to Lockheed Martin in January 2005,GAO-11-380R, Defense Acquisitions: Application of Lessons Learned and Best Practices in the Presidential Helicopter Program, p. 3. Government Accountability Office. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 25 March 2011. Accessed 9 September 2013. to develop and build 28 helicopters. The helicopter was designated VH-71 Kestrel. Five of the initial, less sophisticated version of the VH-71 were due for delivery in 2010, with 23 of the upgraded version due for delivery in 2015. The goal was to retire all VH-3Ds and VH-60Ns along with the five initial VH-71s in 2015, leaving the Marine One fleet with 23 helicopters. By March 2008, the previously estimated $6.1-billion cost of the 28 helicopters had increased to $11.2-billion. Government officials were surprised to discover that each VH-71 would cost $400-million‚Äîmore than the cost of a single Air Force One Boeing VC-25 airplane. Lockheed Martin blamed the Navy for the cost overruns, saying that more than 1,900 extra requirements were added to the project after the contract was signed. The Navy said no extra requirements were added. The company also cited the need to redesign the VH-71 to Navy standards, and an incomplete understanding by the Navy and Lockheed Martin of how much retrofitting the civilian aircraft would need to meet the White House's specifications.Baker, Peter. \\"Cost Nearly Doubles For Marine One Fleet.\\" Washington Post, 17 March 2008. Accessed 9 September 2013. In June 2009, the VH-71 program was canceled because of these cost overruns, which had grown to more than an estimated $13-billion. A Government Accountability Office report issued in March 2011 named three sources of cost overruns. First, asking for development at the same time as production led to extensive retrofitting of models that had just been built. Second, a complete review of the system's requirements was not made until four months after production started, and only then was it discovered that the VH-71's design could not meet the program's needs. Third, the Defense Department and the White House asked for excessive combat and communications capabilities. A developmental VH-92A helicopter conducts landing and take-off testing at the White House South Lawn in September 2018. Shortly after the program's cancellation, the Marine Corps restarted the program. This time, instead of running development and production concurrently, the Corps created an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), which more clearly outlined the aircraft's requirements. The Department approved the ICD in August 2009, naming it the VXX Helicopter Replacement Program. In February 2010, the Navy (of which the Marine Corps is a part) asked private industry for input in an Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) to meet the project's needs. Among the options the Navy suggested was purchasing a single aircraft but developing two versions on it. Another option raised by the AOA was to buy two different aircraft‚Äîa \\"civilian\\" version, with a bathroom, executive suite, and galley, and a \\"military\\" version, with complete command and control capabilities. The AOA drew interest from more than two companies. These included Boeing, which told the press that either its CH-47 Chinook or its Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey could meet the AOA's requirements. Because the AOA contemplated a much longer process of design and production, the Navy said it intended to spend $500-million to keep the VH-3Ds and VH-60s flying.Trimble, Stephen. \\"New VXX Competition Reveals Changes for US Presidential Helicopter.\\" Flight International, 18 February 2010.

More than 800 Marines supervise the operation of the Marine One fleet, which is based in MCAF Quantico, Virginia, with an additional operating location at Naval Support Facility Anacostia in the District of Columbia, but is more often seen in action on the South Lawn of the White House or at Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility in Maryland. At Andrews, the helicopter is sometimes used to connect to Air Force One for longer journeys. Marine One is met on the ground by at least one Marine in full dress uniform (most often two, with one acting as an armed guard). According to a story told by Bruce Babbitt, President Clinton, in his final days of office, while flying over and landing in a remote area near the Grand Canyon, found a Marine waiting on the rock ready to salute him.Speech by Bruce Babbitt.

It is located near the commune of Vallon- Pont-d'Arc on a limestone cliff above the former bed of the Ard√®che River, in the Gorges de l'Ard√®che. Discovered on December 18, 1994, it is considered one of the most significant prehistoric art sites and the UN‚Äôs cultural agency UNESCO granted it World Heritage status on June 22, 2014.France 24. \\"UNESCO grants heritage status to prehistoric French cave\\" , June 2014. The cave was first explored by a group of three speleologists: Eliette Brunel-Deschamps, Christian Hillaire, and Jean-Marie Chauvet for whom it was named six months after an aperture now known as \\"Le Trou de Baba\\" (\\"Baba's Hole\\") was discovered by Michel Rosa (Baba). At a later date the group returned to the cave. Another member of this group, Michel Chabaud, along with two others, travelled further into the cave and discovered the Gallery of the Lions, the End Chamber. Chauvet has his own detailed account of the discovery. In addition to the paintings and other human evidence, they also discovered fossilized remains, prints, and markings from a variety of animals, some of which are now extinct. Further study by French archaeologist Jean Clottes has revealed much about the site. The dates have been a matter of dispute but a study published in 2012 supports placing the art in the Aurignacian period, approximately 32,000‚Äì30,000 years BP. A study published in 2016 using additional 88 radiocarbon dates showed two periods of habitation, one 37,000 to 33,500 years ago and the second from 31,000 to 28,000 years ago, with most of the black drawings dating to the earlier period.  Features  The cave is situated above the previous course of the Ard√®che River before the Pont d'Arc opened up. The gorges of the Ard√®che region are the site of numerous caves, many of them having some geological or archaeological importance. Based on radiocarbon dating, the cave appears to have been used by humans during two distinct periods: the Aurignacian and the Gravettian.See the section on Dating. Most of the artwork dates to the earlier, Aurignacian, era (32,000 to 30,000 years ago). The later Gravettian occupation, which occurred 27,000 to 25,000 years ago, left little but a child's footprints, the charred remains of ancient hearths, and carbon smoke stains from torches that lit the caves. The footprints may be the oldest human footprints that can be dated accurately. After the child's visit to the cave, evidence suggests that due to a landslide which covered its historical entrance, the cave remained untouched until it was discovered in 1994.Curtis, Gregory (2006). The Cave Painters: Probing the Mysteries of the World's First Artists. New York: Knopf, pp. 215‚Äì16. The soft, clay-like floor of the cave retains the paw prints of cave bears along with large, rounded depressions that are believed to be the \\"nests\\" where the bears slept. Fossilized bones are abundant and include the skulls of cave bears and the horned skull of an ibex. A set of foot prints of a young child and a wolf or dog walking side by side was found in this cave. This information suggests the origin of the domestic dog could date to before the last ice age.  Paintings  Replica of Paintings in the Chauvet Cave Image of Steppe Wisent (Bison priscus). Paintings in the Chauvet Cave on Post stamp of Romania 2001 Replica of Painting of Lions A Group of Rhinos Painting of Deer Hundreds of animal paintings have been catalogued, depicting at least 13 different species, including some rarely or never found in other ice age paintings. Rather than depicting only the familiar herbivores that predominate in Paleolithic cave art, i.e. horses, aurochs, mammoths, etc., the walls of the Chauvet Cave feature many predatory animals, e.g., cave lions, leopards, bears, and cave hyenas. There are also paintings of rhinoceroses. Typical of most cave art, there are no paintings of complete human figures, although there is one partial \\"Venus\\" figure composed of what appears to be a vulva attached to an incomplete pair of legs. Above the Venus, and in contact with it, is a bison head, which has led some to describe the composite drawing as a Minotaur. There are a few panels of red ochre hand prints and hand stencils made by blowing pigment over hands pressed against the cave surface. Abstract markings‚Äîlines and dots‚Äîare found throughout the cave. There are also two unidentifiable images that have a vaguely butterfly or avian shape to them. This combination of subjects has led some students of prehistoric art and cultures to believe that there was a ritual, shamanic, or magical aspect to these paintings.See, for example, Lewis-Williams (2002). One drawing, later overlaid with a sketch of a deer, is reminiscent of a volcano spewing lava, similar to the regional volcanoes that were active at the time. If confirmed, this would represent the earliest known drawing of a volcanic eruption. The artists who produced these paintings used techniques rarely found in other cave art. Many of the paintings appear to have been made only after the walls were scraped clear of debris and concretions, leaving a smoother and noticeably lighter area upon which the artists worked. Similarly, a three- dimensional quality and the suggestion of movement are achieved by incising or etching around the outlines of certain figures. The art is also exceptional for its time for including \\"scenes\\", e.g., animals interacting with each other; a pair of woolly rhinoceroses, for example, are seen butting horns in an apparent contest for territory or mating rights.  Dating  The cave contains some of the oldest known cave paintings, based on radiocarbon dating of \\"black from drawings, from torch marks and from the floors\\", according to Jean Clottes. Clottes concludes that the \\"dates fall into two groups, one centered around 27,000‚Äì26,000 BP and the other around 32,000‚Äì30,000 BP.\\" As of 1999, the dates of 31 samples from the cave had been reported. The earliest, sample Gifa 99776 from \\"zone 10\\", dates to 32,900 ¬± 490 BP.Clottes (2003b), p. 33. See also Chauvet (1996), p. 131, for a chronology of dates from various caves. Bahn's foreword and Clottes' epilogue to Chauvet (1996) discuss dating. Some archaeologists have questioned these dates. Christian Z√ºchner, relying on stylistic comparisons with similar paintings at other well-dated sites, expressed the opinion that the red paintings are from the Gravettian period (c. 28,000‚Äì23,000 BP) and the black paintings are from the Early Magdalenian period (early part of c. 18,00010,000 BP). Clottes (2003b), pp. 213‚Äì14, has a response by Clottes. Pettitt and Bahn also contended that the dating is inconsistent with the traditional stylistic sequence and that there is uncertainty about the source of the charcoal used in the drawings and the extent of surface contamination on the exposed rock surfaces.Pettitt, P. (2008). \\"Art and the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition in Europe: Comments on the archaeological arguments for an early Upper Paleolithic antiquity of the Grotte Chauvet art\\". Journal of Human Evolution, 2008 Aug 2. (abstract)Bahn, P., P. Pettitt and C. Z√ºchner, \\"The Chauvet Conundrum: Are claims for the 'birthplace of art' premature?\\" in An Enquiring Mind: Studies in Honor of Alexander Marshack (ed. P. Bahn), Oxford 2009, pp. 253‚Äì78. Stylistic studies showed that some Gravettian engravings are superimposed on black paintings proving the paintings' older origins.Guy, Emmanuel (2004). The Grotte Chauvet: a completely homogeneous art? , paleoesthetique.com, February 2004. By 2011, more than 80 radiocarbon dates had been taken, with samples from torch marks and from the paintings themselves, as well as from animal bones and charcoal found on the cave floor. The radiocarbon dates from these samples suggest that there were two periods of creation in Chauvet: 35,000 years ago and 30,000 years ago. This would place the occupation and painting of the cave within the Aurignacian period. A research article published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in May 2012 by scientists from the University of Savoy, Aix-Marseille University and the Centre National de Prehistoire confirmed that the paintings were created by people in the Aurignacian era, between 30,000 and 32,000 years ago. The researchers‚Äô findings are based on the analysis using geomorphological and dating of the rock slide surfaces around what is believed to be the cave‚Äôs only entrance. Their analysis showed that the entrance was sealed by a collapsing cliff some 29,000 years ago. Their findings put the date of human presence in the cave and the paintings in line with that deduced from radiocarbon dating, i.e., between 32,000‚Äì30,000 years BP. A 2016 study in the same journal examining 259 radiocarbon dates, some unpublished before, concluded that there were two phases of human occupation, one running from 37,000 to 33,500 years ago and the second from 31,000 to 28,000 years ago. All but two of the dates for the black drawings were from the earlier phase. The authors believe that the first phase ended with a rockfall that sealed the cave, with two more rockfalls at the end of the second occupation phase after which no humans or large animals entered the cave until it was rediscovered.Anita Quiles, H√©l√®ne Valladas, Herv√© Bocherens, Emmanuelle Delqu√©-Kolic, Evelyne Kaltnecker, Johannes van der Plicht, Jean-Jacques Delannoy, Val√©rie Feruglio, Carole Fritz, Julien Monney, Michel Philippe, Gilles Tosello, Jean Clottes, and Jean-Michel Geneste \\"A high-precision chronological model for the decorated Upper Paleolithic cave of Chauvet-Pont d‚ÄôArc, Ard√®che, France\\" PNAS 2016 113 (17) 4670‚Äì75; In an email to the Los Angeles Times two of the authors explained, In 2020, researchers used the new IntCal20 radiocarbon calibration curve to estimate that the oldest painting in the cave was created 36,500 years ago. Cave hyena (Crocuta crocuta spelaea) painting  Preservation  The cave has been sealed off to the public since 1994. Access is severely restricted owing to the experience with decorated caves such as Altamira and Lascaux found in the 19th and 20th century, where the admission of visitors on a large scale led to the growth of mold on the walls that damaged the art in places. In 2000 the archaeologist and expert on cave paintings Dominique Baffier was appointed to oversee conservation and management of the cave. She was followed in 2014 by Marie Bardisa. Caverne du Pont-d'Arc, a facsimile of Chauvet Cave on the model of the so-called \\"Faux Lascaux\\", was opened to the general public on 25 April 2015. It is the largest cave replica ever built worldwide, ten times bigger than the Lascaux facsimile. The art is reproduced full-size in a condensed replica of the underground environment, in a circular building above ground, a few kilometres from the actual cave.

Its natural range extends from southeastern Canada, southwest to the edge of the Rocky Mountains, as far east as Nova Scotia and Florida. The three species of Chelydra and the larger alligator snapping turtles (genus Macrochelys) are the only extant chelydrids, a family now restricted to the Americas. The common snapping turtle, as its name implies, is the most widespread. The common snapping turtle is noted for its combative disposition when out of the water with its powerful beak-like jaws, and highly mobile head and neck (hence the specific name serpentina, meaning \\"snake- like\\"). In water, they are likely to flee and hide themselves underwater in sediment. Snapping turtles have a life-history strategy characterized by high and variable mortality of embryos and hatchlings, delayed sexual maturity, extended adult longevity, and iteroparity (repeated reproductive events) with low reproductive success per reproductive event. Females, and presumably also males, in more northern populations mature later (at 15‚Äì20 years) and at a larger size than in more southern populations (about 12 years). Lifespan in the wild is poorly known, but long-term mark-recapture data from Algonquin Park in Ontario, Canada, suggest a maximum age over 100 years. Anatomy and morphology Close-up in Taum Sauk Mountain State Park Head Skull Holbrook's North American Herpetology, 1842 C. serpentina has a rugged, muscular build with a ridged carapace (upper shell), although ridges tend to be more pronounced in younger individuals. The carapace length in adulthood may be nearly , though is more common. C. serpentina usually weighs . Per one study, breeding common snapping turtles were found to average in carapace length, in plastron length and weigh about .Iverson, J.B.; Higgins, H.; Sirulnik, A.; Griffiths, C. (1997). \\"Local and geographic variation in the reproductive biology of the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina)\\". Herpetologica 53 (1): 96-117. Males are larger than females, with almost all weighing in excess of being male and quite old, as the species continues to grow throughout life. Any specimen above the aforementioned weights is exceptional, but the heaviest wild specimen caught reportedly weighed . Snapping turtles kept in captivity can be quite overweight due to overfeeding and have weighed as much as . In the northern part of its range, the common snapping turtle is often the heaviest native freshwater turtle.Virginia Herpetological Society: Eastern Snapping Turtle Chelydra serpentina serpentina right Ecology and life history Common habitats are shallow ponds or streams. Some may inhabit brackish environments, such as estuaries. Common snapping turtles sometimes bask‚Äîthough rarely observed‚Äîby floating on the surface with only their carapaces exposed, though in the northern parts of their range, they also readily bask on fallen logs in early spring. In shallow waters, common snapping turtles may lie beneath a muddy bottom with only their heads exposed, stretching their long necks to the surface for an occasional breath (their nostrils are positioned on the very tip of the snout, effectively functioning as snorkels). Snapping turtles consume both plant and animal matter, and are important aquatic scavengers, but they are also active hunters that prey on anything they can swallow, including many invertebrates, fish, frogs, reptiles (including snakes and smaller turtles), unwary birds, and small mammals. In some areas adult snapping turtles can be incidentally detrimental to breeding waterfowl, as they will occasionally take ducklings and goslings, but their effect on such prey is frequently exaggerated.Hammer, D.A. (1972). Ecological relations of waterfowl and snapping turtle populations. Ph.D. dissertation, Utah State University, Salt Lake City, UT. 72 pg. Eggs Common snapping turtles have few predators when older, but eggs are subject to predation by crows, American mink, skunks, foxes, and raccoons. As hatchlings and juveniles, most of the same predators will attack them as well as herons (mostly great blue herons), bitterns, hawks, owls, fishers, American bullfrogs, large fish, and snakes. There are records during winter in Canada of hibernating adult common snapping turtles being ambushed and preyed on by northern river otters.Brooks, R.J.; Brown, G.P.; Galbraith, D.A. (1991). \\"Effects of a sudden increase in natural mortality of adults on a population of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina)\\". Canadian Journal of Zoology 69 (5): 1314-1320. Other natural predators which have reportedly preyed on adults include coyotes, American black bears, American alligators and their larger cousins, alligator snapping turtles.Ernst, C.H., & Lovich, J. E. (2009). Turtles of the United States and Canada. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Large, old male snapping turtles have very few natural threats due to their formidable size and defenses, and tend to have a very low annual mortality rate. These turtles travel extensively over land to reach new habitats or to lay eggs. Pollution, habitat destruction, food scarcity, overcrowding, and other factors drive snappers to move; it is quite common to find them traveling far from the nearest water source. Experimental data supports the idea that snapping turtles can sense the Earth's magnetic field, which could also be used for such movements (together with a variety of other possible orientation cues). This species mates from April through November, with their peak laying season in June and July. The female can hold sperm for several seasons, using it as necessary. Females travel over land to find sandy soil in which to lay their eggs, often some distance from the water. After digging a hole, the female typically deposits 25 to 80 eggs each year, guiding them into the nest with her hind feet and covering them with sand for incubation and protection. Incubation time is temperature-dependent, ranging from 9 to 18 weeks. In cooler climates, hatchlings overwinter in the nest. The common snapping turtle is remarkably cold-tolerant; radiotelemetry studies have shown some individuals do not hibernate, but remain active under the ice during the winter. Hibernating snapping turtles do not breathe for, in the northern part of their range, more than six months since ice covers their hibernating site. These turtles can get oxygen by pushing their head out of the mud and allowing gas exchange to take place through the membranes of their mouth and throat. This is known as extrapulmonary respiration. If they cannot get enough oxygen through this method they start to utilize anaerobic pathways, burning sugars and fats without the use of oxygen. The metabolic by-products from this process are acidic and create very undesirable side effects by spring, which are known as oxygen debt. Although designated as \\"least concern\\" on the IUCN redlist, the species has been designated in the Canadian part of its range as \\"Special Concern\\" due to its life history being sensitive to disruption by anthropogenic activity. Systematics and taxonomy Currently, no subspecies of the common snapping turtle are recognized. The former Florida subspecies osceola is currently considered a synonym of serpentina, while the other former subspecies Chelydra rossignonii and Chelydra acutirostris are both recognized as full species.Chelydra, Reptile Database  Behavior  In their environment, they are at the top of the food chain, causing them to feel less fear or aggression in some cases. When they encounter a species unfamiliar to them such as humans, in rare instances, they will become curious and survey the situation and even more rarely may bump their nose on a leg of the person standing in the water. Although snapping turtles have fierce dispositions,Snapping Turtle, Encyclopedia.com when they are encountered in the water or a swimmer approaches, they will slip quietly away from any disturbance or may seek shelter under mud or grass nearby.Common Snapping Turtle, Nature.ca Relationship with humans=As food The common snapping turtle is a traditional ingredient in turtle soup; consumption in large quantities, however, can become a health concern due to potential concentration of toxic environmental pollutants in the turtle's flesh. Captivity The common snapping turtle is not an ideal pet. Its neck is very flexible, and a wild turtle can bite its handler even if picked up by the sides of its shell. The claws are about as sharp as those of dogs, but cannot be trimmed as can dog claws. Despite this, a snapping turtle cannot use its claws for either attacking (its legs have no speed or strength in \\"swiping\\" motions) or eating (no opposable thumbs), but only as aids for digging and gripping. Veterinary care is best left to a reptile specialist. A wild common snapping turtle will make a hissing sound when it is threatened or encountered, but they prefer not to invoke confrontations. It is a common misconception that common snapping turtles may be safely picked up by the tail with no harm to the animal; in fact, this has a high chance of injuring the turtle, especially the tail itself and the vertebral column. Lifting the turtle with the hands is difficult and dangerous. Snappers can stretch their necks back across their own carapace and to their hind feet on either side to bite. When they feel stressed, they release a musky odor from behind their legs. It may be tempting to rescue a snapping turtle found on a road by getting it to bite a stick and then dragging it out of immediate danger. This action can, however, severely scrape the legs and underside of the turtle and lead to deadly infections in the wounds. The safest way to pick up a common snapping turtle is by grasping the carapace above the back legs. There is a large gap above the back legs that allows for easy grasping of the carapace and keeps hands safe from both the beak and claws of the turtle. It can also be picked up with a shovel, from the back, making sure the shovel is square across the bottom of the shell. The easiest way, though, is with a blanket or tarp, picking up the corners with the turtle in the middle. Snapping turtles are raised on some turtle farms in China.Fang Anning (ÊñπÂÆâÂÆÅ), \\"‚ÄúÂ∞èÂ∫≠Èô¢‚ÄùÂÖªÊÆñÈæüÈ≥ñÂ§ßÊúâËµöÂ§¥ \\" (Small-scale turtle farming may be very profitable). Zuojiang Daily (Â∑¶Ê±üÊó•Êä•) (with photo) In politics Political cartoon depicting merchants attempting to dodge the \\"Ograbme\\" The common snapping turtle was the central feature of a famous American political cartoon. Published in 1808 in protest at the Jeffersonian Embargo Act of 1807, the cartoon depicted a snapping turtle, jaws locked fiercely to an American trader who was attempting to carry a barrel of goods onto a British ship. The trader was seen whimsically uttering the words \\"Oh! this cursed Ograbme\\" (\\"embargo\\" spelled backwards, and also \\"O, grab me\\" as the turtle is doing). This piece is widely considered a pioneering work within the genre of the modern political cartoon. In 2006, the common snapping turtle was declared the state reptile of New York by a sweeping vote of the New York Legislature after being popularly chosen by the state's public elementary school children. Reputation While it is widely rumored that common snapping turtles can bite off human fingers or toes, and their powerful jaws are more than capable of doing so, no proven cases have ever been presented for this species, as they use their overall size and strength to deter would-be predators. Common snapping turtles are \\"quite docile\\" animals underwater that prefer to avoid confrontations rather than provoke them. In 2002, a study done in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology found that the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) registered between 208 and 226 Newtons of force when it came to jaw strength. In comparison, the average bite force of a human (molars area) is between 300 and 700 Newtons. Another non-closely related species known as the alligator snapping turtle has been known to bite off fingers, and at least three documented cases are known. Invasive species In recent years in Italy, large mature adult C. serpentina turtles have been taken from bodies of water throughout the country. They were most probably introduced by the release of unwanted pets. In March 2011, an individual weighing was captured in a canal near Rome;\\"Una \\"azzanatrice\\" catturata fuori Roma\\". (March 17, 2011). Corriere della Sera. Milan. another individual was captured near Rome in September 2012. In Japan, the species was introduced as an exotic pet in the 1960s; it has been recorded as the source of serious bite injuries. In 2004 and 2005, some 1,000 individuals were found in Chiba Prefecture, making up the majority of individuals believed to have been introduced. Conservation The species is currently classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, but has declined sufficiently due to pressure from collection for the pet trade and habitat degradation that Canada and several U.S. states have enacted or are proposing stricter conservation measures. In Canada, it is listed as 'Special Concern' in the Species at Risk Act in 2011 and is a target species for projects that include surveys, identification of major habitats, investigation and mitigation of threats, and education of the public including landowners. Involved bodies include governmental departments, universities, museums, and citizen science projects.

The headquarters are in Los Angeles, California, United States. History Angelus Temple, built by Aimee Semple McPherson and dedicated January 1, 1923. The temple is opposite Echo Park, near downtown Los Angeles, California. In 1922, Aimee Semple McPherson (1890‚Äì1944), an evangelist known as \\"Sister Aimee\\", explained for the first time her definition of the term Foursquare Gospel (similar to the Pentecostal and Charismatic Christian theological concept of the \\"Full Gospel\\"). What is Foursquare?, International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, Accessed September 11, 2016 According to chapter 1 of Book of Ezekiel, Ezekiel had a vision of God as revealed to be four different aspects: a man, a lion, an ox and an eagle. It also represents the four aspects of the Department of Christ; Savior, Baptizer with the Holy Spirit, Healer and Soon-coming King. This was the vision and name she gave at Foursquare Church, founded in 1923 in Los Angeles,Edith Waldvogel Blumhofer, Aimee Semple McPherson: everybody's sister, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, USA, 1993, page 246‚Äì247 which became her center of operations, and where she also opened in 1923 Angelus Temple, seating 5,300 people, in Echo Park.Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2002, page 295 The attendance has become a megachurch with 10,000 people.Thomas, Lately Storming Heaven: The Lives and Turmoils of Minnie Kennedy and Aimee Semple McPherson, Ballantine Books, USA, 1970) page 32 McPherson was a flamboyant celebrity in her day, participating in publicity events, such as weekly Sunday parades through the streets of Los Angeles, along with the mayor and movie stars, directly to Angelus Temple. She built the temple, as well as what is now known as Life Pacific University adjacent to it, on the northwest corner of land that she owned in the middle of the city. McPherson's celebrity status continued after her death, with biopics such as the 1976 Hallmark Hall of Fame drama The Disappearance of Aimee depicting her life, as well as the 2006 independent film Aimee Semple McPherson, which particularly focused on her month-long disappearance in May‚ÄìJune 1926 and the legal controversy that followed.Epstein, Daniel Mark, Sister Aimee: The Life of Aimee Semple McPherson (Orlando: Harcourt Brace & Co., 1993) pp. 296, chapter \\"Kidnapped\\"Matthew Avery Sutton, Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2007)p90, chapters \\"Kidnapping the Bride of Christ and p119, \\"Unraveling the Mystery\\"Cox, Raymond L.

McPherson became president and leader of the church, a position he held for 44 years.J. Gordon Melton and Martin Baumann, Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, page 1461 The Foursquare Church formed the \\"Pentecostal Fellowship of North America\\" in 1948 in Des Moines, Iowa, in an alliance with the Assemblies of God, the Church of God, the Open Bible Standard Churches, the Pentecostal Holiness Church, and others. In 1994, 46 years after the founding of the Pentecostal Fellowship, it was reorganized as the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America after combining with African-American organizations, most significantly the Church of God in Christ. On May 31, 1988, John R. Holland became the Church's third President, a position he held until July 1997. Harold Helms served as interim president from July 1997 until July 1998; he was followed by Paul C. Risser, who became the president on April 16, 1998, at the church's 75th annual convention. In October 2003, under Risser's tenure, the church sold Los Angeles radio station KFSG-FM to the Spanish Broadcasting System for $250 million. Risser's leadership led to another high-profile controversy for the church, when, without the involvement of the denomination's board of directors and finance council, church funds were invested in firms that targeted the \\"close-knit evangelical community\\" but turned out to be Ponzi schemes. Risser resigned his leadership position under fire in March 2004. Jack W. Hayford, founder of The Church On The Way in Van Nuys, California served as the president of the Foursquare Church from 2004 to 2009. Hayford along with Pastors Roy Hicks Jr. in Eugene, Oregon, Jerry Cook in Gresham, Oregon, Ronald D. Mehl of the Beaverton Foursquare Church in Beaverton, Oregon, and John Holland in Vancouver, British Columbia, have been credited by the church with setting a plan for the denomination's continued survival despite its staggering financial losses estimated at $15 million under the failed leadership of Paul Risser. The Foursquare denomination, under Hayford's leadership, is in \\"Missional Conversation\\" with the emerging church movement, claimed to be part of a \\"Church Multiplication\\" effort. \\"Church Multiplication\\" also supports the house church movement through resources that support the expansion of \\"Foursquare Simple Church Networks.\\" In 2020, Randy Remington became the President of The Foursquare Church.

Accessed January 11, 2013. McPherson also authored a shorter, more concise creedal statement.Creedal Statements of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. Accessed January 11, 2013. The church believes in the verbal inspiration of the Bible, the doctrine of the Trinity, and the deity of Jesus Christ.ICFG Creedal Statements 1‚Äì3 It believes that human beings were created in the image of God but, because of the Fall, are naturally depraved and sinful.III. The Fall of Man, ICFG Declaration of Faith. It believes in the substitutionary atonement accomplished by the death of Christ. The church teaches that salvation is by grace through faith and not by good works.ICFG Creedal Statements 9. Believers are justified by faith and born again upon repentance and acceptance of Christ as Lord and king.VI. Repentance and Acceptance and VII. The New Birth, ICFG Declaration of Faith. Consistent with its belief in human free will, the Foursquare Church also teaches that it is possible for a believer to backslide or commit apostasy.ICFG Creedal Statements 24. The Foursquare Church teaches that sanctification is a continual process of spiritual growth.VIII. Daily Christian Life, ICFG Declaration of Faith. Christian perfection and holiness can be attained through surrender and consecration to God. This spiritual growth is believed to be promoted by Bible study and prayer.ICFG Creedal Statements 25‚Äì27. The Foursquare Church believes in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an event separate from conversion that empowers the individual and the wider church to fulfill the church's mission of evangelization. The Foursquare Church expects Spirit baptism to be received in the same manner as recorded in the Book of Acts, namely that the believer will receive spiritual gifts, possibly (though not necessarily) including speaking in tongues.X. The Baptism of the Holy Spirit, ICFG Declaration of Faith. The evidence of the Spirit-filled life is the Fruit of the Spirit. The church believes that spiritual gifts continue in operation for the edification of the church.XII. The Gifts and Fruit of the Spirit, ICFG Declaration of Faith. The Foursquare Church believes that divine healing is a part of Christ's atonement. It teaches that the sick can be healed in response to prayer.XIV. Divine Healing, ICFG Declaration of Faith. The Foursquare Church anticipates a premillennial return of Christ to earth.ICFG Creedal Statements 36. It believes that there will be a future final judgment where the righteous will receive everlasting life and the wicked everlasting punishment. The Foursquare Church observes believer's baptism by immersion and the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion as ordinances.IX. Water Baptism and the Lord's Supper, ICFG Declaration of Faith. Open communion is practiced.ICFG Creedal Statements 14 and 23. Anointing of the sick and tithing are practiced as well.ICFG Creedal Statements 10, 11, 21. Structure The denomination's church government has an \\"episcopal character\\" that dates back to its founder. McPherson had veto power over church decisions, appointed all officers, and hired all employees. The Foursquare Convention is the chief decision making body of the Foursquare Church. Meeting regularly every year, the convention's voting membership includes international officers and licensed ministers. Each Foursquare church located in the United States has the right to send one voting delegate per every 50 church members.Foursquare Church Bylaws 2012 edition, Article V 5.5, p. 7. National Foursquare Churches outside of the United States may send one official delegate to the convention.Foursquare Church Bylaws, Article XVIIII, p. 46. A board of 12 to 20 directors manages the Foursquare Church. In addition to overseeing the Church's activities, the board of directors appoints officers and is responsible for licensing and ordaining ministers. Members of the board include the president, vice presidents, and at least nine ministers representing geographic regions. Church members in good standing may also be appointed to the board.Foursquare Church Bylaws, Article VI, pp. 9‚Äì12. Local Foursquare churches are subordinate parts of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel and are operated according to the bylaws of the international church. There are two categories of Foursquare churches.Foursquare Church Bylaws, Article III 3.3, p. 3. A \\"charter member church\\" is a member church that has no legal existence apart from the international church and whose property is owned by the international church. The second category is \\"covenant member church\\", which include \\"pioneer churches\\" and previously non-member churches. Pioneer churches are recently established church plants that have not been upgraded to charter member status. Covenant member churches might also be previously non-member churches that join the Foursquare Church but choose not to transfer their real property to the international church.Foursquare Church Bylaws, Article III 3.8 A‚ÄìB, p. 4. Non-member churches may choose to affiliate with the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel without becoming a full member of the international church. These \\"community member churches\\" retain their separate legal identities and autonomy.Foursquare Church Bylaws, Article III 3.8 C, p. 5. North America Two colleges are affiliated with the Foursquare Church: Life Pacific College, formerly \\"L. I. F. E. Bible College,\\" in San Dimas, California, and Pacific Life Bible College in Surrey, British Columbia. In 2006, membership in the United States was 353,995 in 1,875 churches. While congregations are concentrated along the West Coast, the denomination is well distributed across the United States. The states with the highest membership rates are Oregon, Hawaii, Montana, Washington, and California. Controversies In 2014, facts came to light that under Burris' leadership, the Church lost yet another $2 million in a failed investment of a Broadway play based on the life of Aimee McPherson.

Born in 1922, Baskeyfield was called up to the army in 1942. He served with the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment, an airlanding unit of the 1st Airborne Division, in Sicily and Italy in 1943 before returning to the United Kingdom. The division was next deployed in Operation Market Garden and fought in the subsequent Battle of Arnhem. While defending the Oosterbeek perimeter three days into the battle, Baskeyfield commanded a pair of anti-tank guns that destroyed several enemy tanks before the crews were killed. Baskeyfield subsequently fired the guns alone before he too was killed. His body was not identified after the war and he has no known grave. Early life John Baskeyfield was born on 18 November 1922 in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, England, the son of Daniel and Minnie Baskeyfield. He trained and worked as a butcher during the early years of the Second World War, until he received his call up papers in February 1942 at the age of 19. Early military service Baskeyfield joined the South Staffordshire Regiment and served with the 2nd Battalion's anti-tank platoon. The 2nd Battalion was part of 1st Airlanding Brigade, itself part of the 1st Airborne Division and Baskeyfield accompanied them to North Africa, from where they took part in Operation Ladbroke, the glider-borne element of the Invasion of Sicily in 1943. The division then landed in Italy as part of Operation Slapstick and spent some weeks fighting their way through the country before sailing back to England. Battle of Arnhem The Battle of Arnhem was part of Operation Market Garden, an attempt to secure a string of bridges through the Netherlands. At Arnhem the British 1st Airborne Division and Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade were tasked with securing bridges across the Lower Rhine, the final objectives of the operation. However, the airborne forces that dropped on 17 September were not aware that the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer divisions were also near Arnhem for rest and refit.Middlebrook, p. 67 Their presence added a substantial number of Panzergrenadiers, tanks and self- propelled guns to the German defences and the Allies suffered heavily in the ensuing battle. Only a small force managed to hold one end of the Arnhem road bridge before being overrun on 21 September. The rest of the division became trapped in a small pocket west of the bridge and had to be evacuated on 25 September in Operation Berlin. The Allies failed to cross the Rhine, which remained under German control until Allied offensives in March 1945.Kershaw, p. 303 South Staffordshire's advance Men of the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment advance toward Arnhem, towing a 6 pounder anti‚Äìtank gun with them, 18 September. Owing to a shortage of aircraft, the Allies planned to fly the entire division to Arnhem over three days.Waddy, p. 38 The South Staffordshire Battalion was split between the lifts on day one and day two; most of the unit arrived on day one, with the remaining balance arriving with the second lift. The battalion's anti-tank guns were flown from RAF Manston on day one.Middlebrook, p. 76 Major General Roy Urquhart's original plan envisaged the 1st Airlanding Brigade securing the drop zones for subsequent lifts,Middlebrook, p. 31 but by the end of day one the Allied advance into Arnhem had stalled. Only a small group of the 1st Parachute Brigade, mainly elements of Lieutenant Colonel John Frost's 2nd Battalion, were able to reach the bridge.Waddy, p. 65 The 1st and 3rd Battalions were unable to penetrate the outer suburbs of the city and their advance stalled, so in order to support them the first lift of the South Stafford's were sent forward on the morning of 18 September.Waddy, p. 79 When the second lift arrived later that day they too were sent forward and arrived at the outskirts of Arnhem that night.Middlebrook, p. 188 The South Staffordshire's anti-tank platoon was kept in the divisional area.Middlebrook, p. 212 In the early hours of the morning of 19 September, an attack was launched on a narrow front between the river and the railway line, in order to force a passage through to the bridge.Middlebrook, p. 191 Most of the support weapons were left in the rear, as they were unable to suitably deploy in the dark and in the narrow confines of the urban surroundings.Middlebrook, p. 200 However, in the face of strong enemy positions and armour, the attack faltered and the British routed.Middlebrook, p. 216 Withdrawal to Oosterbeek A 6 pounder anti‚Äìtank gun of the Border Regiment engages enemy armour on the western perimeter of Oosterbeek, on the same day as Baskeyfield's action. The remnants of the four battalions fell back in disarray to the main divisional positions at Oosterbeek. Here they were gathered into defensive units by Lieutenant Colonel Sheriff Thompson, Commanding Officer of the 1st Airlanding Light Artillery Regiment, who forcibly stopped many of the panicked troopsMiddlebrook, p. 326 and had Major Robert Cain form them into a defensive screen half a mile in front of his own 75 Millimetre Howitzers positions. The sector was designated \\"Thompson Force\\", but Thompson actually sent Major Richard Lonsdale forward to take command of these outlying troops later in the day.Middlebrook, p327 The German forces made determined attacks against Lonsdale's force on 20 September, starting soon after dawn.Middlebrook, p. 332 Baskeyfield was in charge of two 6 pounder anti‚Äìtank guns defending a T junction on the Benedendorpsweg, the southernmost road between Arnhem and Oosterbeek.Steer, p. 53 Baskeyfield's guns faced up the Acacialaan, which joined the Benedendorpsweg from the north, and covered the likely enemy approach along this road and from open ground to the north east. His right flank ‚Äì to the east ‚Äì was covered by another anti-tank gun commanded by Lance- Sergeant Mansell.Steer, p. 54 In an initial German assault, Baskeyfield and his gun crews destroyed two tanks and a self-propelled gun as they advanced down the Acacialaan.Middlebrook, p. 333 Baskeyfield allowed the armour to come within 100 yards of his positions before ordering his crews to fire, while paratroopers of the 11th Battalion in nearby houses dealt with attacking infantry.Waddy, p. 134 In the course of this action, Baskeyfield's crew was killed or wounded and Baskeyfield himself was badly injured. However he refused to be evacuated and in a later German attack he worked his gun alone, loading, laying and firing it himself. He fired round after round until enemy fire put his gun out of action, and crawled to the second gun, whose crew had similarly been disabled. From here he engaged another self-propelled gun, dispatching it with two rounds, but was killed shortly afterwards by fire from another German tank. Lonsdale's men fell back to new positions later that day and \\"Thompson Force\\" was renamed \\"Lonsdale Force\\" when Thompson was wounded on 21 September.Middlebrook, p. 336 The force continued to hold the Oosterbeek perimeter until the Allies withdrew in Operation Berlin on the night of 25 September.Middlebrook, p. 335 Victoria Cross A Victoria Cross The full citation for Baskeyfield's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette on 23 November 1944, reading: Legacy Festival Heights in Stoke-on-Trent After Arnhem was liberated in April 1945, Grave Registration Units of the British 2nd Army moved into the area and began to locate the Allied dead.Waddy, p. 190 Over 1700 men were buried in the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery, but Baskeyfield's body was never identified. Although several hundred burials in the cemetery are unidentified, there are no records of any unidentified soldiers being exhumed from Acacialaan.Steer, p. 56 Instead Baskeyfield's name is inscribed on the Groesbeek Memorial which commemorates all those Allied servicemen killed between August 1944 and the end of the conflict who have no known grave. Four more VCs were awarded after the battle, including one for Major Robert Cain, commander of B Company, 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment.Middlebrook, p. 445 The 2nd Battalion thus became the only British battalion to receive two VCs during one engagement in the Second World War. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Staffordshire Regiment Museum in Whittington, Staffordshire. A twice life size memorial statue of him was erected in 1990 at Festival Heights in Stoke-on-Trent, by sculptors Steven Whyte and Michael Talbot. The John Baskeyfield V.C. Church of England Primary School in Burslem was named after him but was renamed Saint Nathaniel's Academy on 1 March 2014. The artist Terence Cuneo made a painting of Baskeyfield's action, and in 1969 a Staffordshire filmmaker spent three years making a short film about his role in the battle, entitled Baskeyfield VC. A tree on the site of Baskeyfield's second gun, on the corner of Benedendorpsweg and Acacialaan, has been named the Jack Baskeyfield Tree.Steer, p. 52 See also *List of Second World War Victoria Cross recipients Four other men were awarded the Victoria Cross at Arnhem: *Major Robert Henry Cain, 2nd Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment. *Lieutenant John Hollington Grayburn, 2nd Battalion Parachute Regiment. *Flight Lieutenant David Samuel Anthony Lord, 271 Squadron, Royal Air Force. *Captain Lionel Ernest Queripel, 10th Battalion Parachute Regiment.

The E-4 series are specially modified from the Boeing 747-200B for the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP) program. The E-4 serves as a survivable mobile command post for the National Command Authority, namely the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and successors. The four E-4Bs are operated by the 1st Airborne Command and Control Squadron of the 595th Command and Control Group located at Offutt Air Force Base, near Omaha, Nebraska. An E-4B when in action is denoted a \\"National Airborne Operations Center\\". Development A right front view of an E-4 advanced airborne command post (AABNCP) on the nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) simulator for testing. Two of the original 747-200 airframes were originally planned to be commercial airliners. When the airline did not complete the order, Boeing offered the airframes to the United States Air Force as part of a package leading to a replacement for the older EC-135J National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP). Under the 481B NEACP program the Air Force Electronic Systems Division awarded Boeing a contract in February 1973 for two unequipped aircraft, designated E-4A, powered by four P&W; JT9D engines, to which a third aircraft was added in July 1973. The first E-4A was completed at the Boeing plant outside Seattle, Washington in 1973. E-Systems won the contract to install interim equipment in these three aircraft, and the first completed E-4A was delivered in July 1973 to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. The next two were delivered in October 1973 and October 1974. The third E-4 differed by being powered by the GE F103 engine, which was later made standard and retrofitted to the previous two aircraft. The A-model effectively housed the same equipment as the EC-135, but offered more space and an ability to remain aloft longer than an EC-135.Michell 1994, p. 265. In November 1973, it was reported that the program cost was estimated to total $548 million for seven 747s, six as operational command posts and one for research and development. In December 1973, a fourth aircraft was ordered; it was fitted with more advanced equipment, resulting in the designation E-4B. On 21 December 1979, Boeing delivered the first E-4B (AF Serial Number 75-0125), which was distinguished from the earlier version by the presence of a large streamlined radome on the dorsal surface directly behind the upper deck. This contains the aircraft's SHF satellite antenna.Bowers 1989, p. 528. By January 1985 all three E-4As had been retrofitted to E-4B models. The E-4B offered a vast increase in communications capability over the previous model and was considered to be 'hardened' against the effects of nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from a nuclear blast. Hardening the aircraft meant that all equipment and wiring on board was shielded from EMP. The E-4B fleet has an estimated roll-out cost of approximately US$250 million each. In 2005 the Air Force awarded Boeing a five-year, US$2 billion contract for the continued upgrade of the E-4B fleet. In addition to the purchase and upgrade costs, the E-4 costs nearly $160,000 per hour for the Air Force to operate. Design National Emergency Airborne Command Post internal configuration, April 1976 The E-4B is designed to survive an EMP with systems intact. and has state-of-the-art direct fire countermeasures. Although many older aircraft have been upgraded with glass cockpits, the E-4B still uses traditional analog flight instruments, as they are less susceptible to damage from an EMP blast.\\"American Doomsday\\" overview , video clip . National Geographic. The E-4B is capable of operating with a crew up to 112 people including flight and mission personnel, the largest crew of any aircraft in US Air Force history. With in-flight aerial refueling it is capable of remaining airborne for a considerable period, limited only by consumption of the engines' lubricants. In a test flight for endurance, the aircraft remained airborne and fully operational for 35.4 hours, however it was designed to remain airborne for a full week in the event of an emergency. It takes two fully loaded KC-135 tankers to fully refuel an E-4B. The E-4B has three operational decks: upper, middle, and lower. Middle and upper decks KC-10 Extender of Travis AFB in preparation for aerial refueling The flight deck contains stations for the pilot, co-pilot, and flight engineer, plus a special navigation station not normally found on commercial Boeing 747s. A lounge area and sleeping quarters for flight and maintenance crews are located aft of the flight deck. The flight crew consists of an aircraft commander, co-pilot, navigator, and flight engineer. The middle deck contains the conference room, which provides a secure area for conferences and briefings. It contains a conference table for nine people. Aft of the conference room is a projection room serving the conference room and the briefing room. The projection room had the capability of projecting computer graphics, overhead transparencies, or 35 mm slides to either the conference room or the briefing room either singularly or simultaneously. The projection screens have since been replaced with flat screen displays. The battle staff includes various controllers, planners, launch system officers, communications operators, a weather officer, administrative and support personnel, and a chief of battle staff. The Operation Looking Glass missions were commanded by a general officer with two staff officers, while the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) may rendezvous and embark a member of the National Command Authority (NCA) from an undisclosed location. There are at least 48 crew aboard any E-4B mission. Behind the projection room is the operations team area containing the automatic data processing equipment and seats and console work areas for 29 staff members. The consoles are configured to provide access to or from the automated data processing, automatic switchboard, direct access telephone and radio circuits, direct (\\"hot\\") lines, monitor panel for switchboard lines, staff, and operator inter-phone and audio recorder. The aft compartment at the end of the main deck is the Technical Control (Tech Control) area. This area was the nerve center for all communications and communications technicians. Typically 3 of the 6 crew positions were occupied here by specialized US Air Force technicians that were responsible for the proper monitoring and distribution of all communications power, cooling, and reliability. The Technical Controller No. 1 (Tech 1, TC1) was the direct interface with the aircraft Flight Engineer and Flight Crew. This position was also the main focal point for all communications related issues. The Technical Controller No. 2 (Tech 2, TC2) was responsible for maintaining all ultra high frequency communications between the aircraft and the Nightwatch GEP (Ground Entry Points). These GEP's provided 12 voice lines to the aircraft which were used in the day-to-day operations of the mission. Secure Voice was also provided. The SHF Operator (or technician) maintained the SHF satellite link and provided other worldwide communications services probably having replaced a lot of the UHF capabilities. The rest area, which occupies the remaining portion of the aft main deck, provides a rest and sleeping area for the crew members. The rest area contains storage for food and is also used for religious ceremonies. Within the forward entry area is the main galley unit and stairways to the flight deck and to the forward lower equipment area. This area contains refrigerators, freezers, two convection ovens, and a microwave oven to give stewards the capability to provide more than 100 hot meals during prolonged missions. Additionally, four seats are located on the left side of the forward entry area for the security guards and the stewards. Behind the forward entry area is the National Command Authority (NCA) area, which is designed and furnished as an executive suite. It contains an office, a lounge, a sleeping area, and a dressing room. Telephone instruments in this area provide the NCA with secure and clear worldwide communications. The briefing room contains a briefing table with three executive seats, eighteen additional seats, a lectern, and two 80-inch flat screen LED monitors flush mounted to the partition. The communications control area is divided into a voice area and a data area. The voice area, located on the right side of the compartment, contains the radio operator's console, the semi-automatic switchboard console, and the communication officer's console. The data area, located on the left side of the area, contains the record communications console, record data supervisor's console, high speed DATA/AUTODIN/AFSAT console, and LF/VLF control heads. The E-4B can communicate with the ground over a wide range of frequencies covering virtually the entire radio communications spectrum from 14 kHz to 8.4 GHz. Ground stations can link the E-4B into the main US ground- based communications network. The flight avionics area contains the aircraft systems power panels, flight avionics equipment, liquid oxygen converters, and storage for baggage and spare parts. Lower Lobe The forward lower equipment room contains the aircraft's water supply tanks, 1200 kVA electrical power panels, step down transformers, VLF transmitter, and SHF SATCOM equipment. An AC/DC powered hydraulic retractable airstair is located in the forward right side of the forward lower equipment area, installed for airplane entry and exit. In the event of an emergency, the air stair can be jettisoned. The aft lower lobe contains the maintenance console and mission specific equipment. The lower trailing wire antenna (TWA) area contains the aircraft's TWA reel ‚Äì which is used by up to 13 communications links ‚Äì the antenna operator's station, as well as the antenna reel controls and indicators. Much attention has been given to hardening this area against EMP, especially as the TWA, essential for communicating with Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines, is also particularly effective in picking up EMP. Operational history An E-4 at El Dorado International Airport in Bogot√°, Colombia The E-4 fleet was originally deployed in 1974, when it was termed National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP) (often pronounced \\"kneecap\\"). The aircraft was to provide a survivable platform to conduct war operations in the event of a nuclear attack. Early in the E-4's service, the media dubbed the aircraft as \\"the doomsday planes\\". The E-4 was also capable of operating the \\"Looking Glass\\" missions of the Strategic Air Command (SAC).Alwin 1999, p. 608. The aircraft were originally stationed at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, so that the U.S. president and secretary of defense could access them quickly in the event of an emergency. The name \\"Nightwatch\\" originates from the richly detailed Rembrandt painting, The Night Watch, that depicts local townsfolk protecting a town; it was selected by the Squadron's first commanding officer. Later, the aircraft were moved to Offutt Air Force Base where they would be safer from attack. Until 1994, one E-4B was stationed at Andrews Air Force Base at all times so the President could easily board it in times of world crisis. The NEACP aircraft originally used the static call sign \\"Silver Dollar\\"; this call sign faded from use when daily call signs were put in use. When a President boards the E-4, its call sign becomes \\"Air Force One\\". The E-4B also serves as the Secretary of Defense's preferred means of transportation when traveling outside the U.S.Gilmore, Gerry J. \\"Rumsfeld Uses 'Flying Pentagon' To Communicate During Trips\\" . US Department of Defense, 1 August 2005. The spacious interior and sophisticated communications capability provided by the aircraft allow the Secretary's senior staff to work for the duration of the mission. With the adoption of two highly modified Boeing 747-200Bs (Air Force designation VC-25A) to serve as Air Force One in 1989 and the end of the Cold War, the need for NEACP diminished. In 1994, NEACP began to be known as NAOC, and it took on a new responsibility: ferrying Federal Emergency Management Agency crews to natural disaster sites and serving as a temporary command post on the ground until facilities could be built on site. Evidently no E-4B was employed during the Hurricane Katrina disaster of 2005, though one E-4B was used by FEMA following Hurricane Opal in 1995.. C-32s at Defence Establishment Fairbairn, Canberra, Australia during bilateral defense talks, February 2008 The \\"cocked\\" or \\"on alert\\" E-4B is manned 24 hours a day with a watch crew on board guarding all communications systems awaiting a launch order (klaxon launch). Those crew members not on watch would be in the alert barracks, gymnasium, or at other base facilities. The 24-hour alert status at Andrews AFB ended when President Clinton ordered the aircraft to remain at Offutt unless needed, though relief crews remain based at Andrews and Wright- Patterson Air Force Base. One E-4B is kept on alert at all times. September 2001 to present An E-4 on landing approach at Tinker AFB. On 11 September 2001, an aircraft closely resembling an E-4B was spotted and filmed orbiting the Washington, D.C., area by news outlets and civilians, after the attack on the Pentagon. In his book Black Ice, author Dan Verton identifies this aircraft as an E-4B taking part in an operational exercise, and the exercise was canceled when the first plane struck the World Trade Center.Verton 2003, p. 144. Air traffic control recordings and radar data indicate this E-4B call sign VENUS77 became airborne just before 9:44 am, circled north of the White House during its climb, and then tracked to the south of Washington, D.C., where it held in a holding pattern. In 2008 Brent Scowcroft explained in a book, that he was on this plane to go on an inspection tour to one unspecified nuclear weapons site as chairman of a DoD team called ‚Ä≥End to End review‚Ä≥. Zbigniew Brzezinski, Brent Scowcroft: America and the World. Conversations on the future of American Foreign Policy. Basic Books, New York NY 2008, . In January 2006, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced a plan to retire the entire E-4B fleet starting in 2009. This was reduced to retiring one of the aircraft in February 2007. The next Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, reversed this decision in May 2007.Francillon 2008, p. 37. This is due to the unique capabilities of the E-4B, which cannot be duplicated by any other single aircraft in Air Force service, and the cancellation in 2007 of the E-10 MC2A, which was considered as a successor to the EC-135 and E-8 aircraft, and could also perform many of the same tasks of the E-4B. As of the 2015 federal budget there were no plans for retiring the E-4B. The E-4B airframe has a usable life of 115,000 hours and 30,000 cycles, which would be reached in 2039; the maintenance limiting point would occur sometime in the 2020s. All four produced are operated by the U.S. Air Force, and are assigned to the 1st Airborne Command Control Squadron (1ACCS) of the 595th Command and Control Group at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Operations are coordinated by the United States Strategic Command. When the President travels outside of North America using a VC-25A as Air Force One, an E-4B will deploy to a second airport in the vicinity of the President's destination, to be readily available in the event of a world crisis or an emergency that renders the VC-25A unusable. When President Barack Obama visited Honolulu, Hawaii, an E-4B was often stationed 200 miles away at Hilo International Airport on Hawaii Island. In June 2017, two of the aircraft were damaged by a tornado that struck Offutt AFB, having been struck by falling debris after the tornado damaged the hangar the aircraft were stationed in. They were out of service for eleven weeks while repairs took place.

Specifications (E-4B)Notable appearances in media The E-4B plays a prominent role in two motion pictures. In the 1990 HBO film By Dawn's Early Light, following a nuclear strike by the Russians, the aircraft serves as a flying platform for the presumed president, the ex‚ÄìSecretary of the Interior, who is played by Darren McGavin. The aircraft is pursued by a Boeing EC-135 \\"Looking Glass\\", which successfully intercepts it. In the 2002 motion picture The Sum of All Fears, the president and his staff travel on an E-4B following the detonation of a nuclear weapon by terrorists. In the novel, the Vice President and his family are aboard the NEACP after terrorists detonate a nuclear bomb in Denver while the President and his National Security Advisor are stuck at Camp David during a blinding snowstorm. The E-4's program, Project Nightwatch, was referenced in the book The Fallout, by S. A. Bodeen. National Geographic produced a television special on doomsday planning of the United States which includes footage from inside an E-4 during a drill.

It is part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series and the sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994). Players control Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles the Echidna in their quests to save Angel Island; Sonic tries to prevent Doctor Robotnik from relaunching his orbital weapon, the Death Egg, while Knuckles scuffles with Robotnik's minion, EggRobo. The game takes place across six levels in which the player collects rings and fights bosses. Sega Technical Institute developed Sonic & Knuckles simultaneously alongside Sonic 3. The two were intended to be released as a single game, but time constraints and small cartridge sizes forced Sega to split the project in two. The Sonic & Knuckles cartridge features \\"lock-on technology\\" that allows the game to connect to the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or Sonic the Hedgehog 3 cartridges, combining elements from both games. This feature was implemented so the game could be experienced as intended. Sonic & Knuckles was released for the Sega Genesis on October 18, 1994. It sold 1.24 million copies and received positive reviews; critics were impressed with the replay value and lock-on technology despite its similarity to Sonic 3. Alongside Sonic 3, a Windows port was released through the Sonic & Knuckles Collection (1997). It has also been rereleased through various compilations and on digital platforms such as Xbox Live Arcade and the Wii's Virtual Console, while it was bundled with Sonic 3 on Steam.  Gameplay  Knuckles explores Mushroom Hill, the first zone of Sonic & Knuckles Since Sonic & Knuckles and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 were initially developed as one game, their gameplay is similar: both are 2D side-scrolling platformers with similar level design, graphics, and game mechanics. However, in Sonic & Knuckles, unlike in Sonic 3, the player chooses either Sonic or Knuckles at the title screen, Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower is not available to select, and the player cannot control two characters together. There is also no multiplayer mode or save feature. The player character moves through six levels, each divided into two acts.Sonic & Knuckles (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 12‚Äì15. The first act of each level ends with a miniboss fight with one of Dr. Robotnik's robots,Sonic & Knuckles (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 9. while the second ends with a regular boss fight with Robotnik (or EggRobo in Knuckles' campaign).Sonic & Knuckles (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 15. Sonic and Knuckles traverse levels differently; Sonic can jump slightly higher and has access to unique shield abilities, whereas Knuckles can glide and climb most walls. The levels also include cutscenes that differ based on the character selected, as Sonic and Knuckles are opponents for most of the game. The game contains two types of bonus stages accessed by passing a checkpoint with at least 20 rings. The first type has Sonic or Knuckles orbit floating, glowing spheres, jetting off each one when a button is pressed, while a fence of light approaches from the bottom and will remove the player from the stage if touched. Collecting 50 rings in this stage earns the player a continue. The second type involves bouncing around a room with a slot machine in its center with the intention of winning extra lives and power-ups.Sonic & Knuckles (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 16‚Äì18. Special Stages are entered by finding giant rings hidden in secret passageways: the player is placed in a 3D environment and must turn all of a number of blue spheres red by running through them, but must avoid all red spheres, including formerly blue ones. Yellow spheres bounce the player long distances, and white spheres with red stars on them make the player walk backwards in the opposite direction. Completing a Special Stage earns the player a Chaos Emerald; collecting all seven Emeralds allows the player to turn into Super Sonic or Super Knuckles, more powerful versions of the characters.  Lock-on technology  Sonic & Knuckles features \\"lock-on technology\\" that allows players to open the hatch on the cartridge and insert a second cartridge. When Sonic 3 is inserted, the player can play through both games as one, Sonic 3 & Knuckles. This features several changes to the games, such as slightly altered level layouts,Sonic & Knuckles (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 22. the ability to play through Sonic 3 levels as Knuckles or Sonic & Knuckles levels as Tails, and the ability to save progress in Sonic & Knuckles levels.Sonic & Knuckles (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 22‚Äì24. Additionally, combining the cartridges is the only way to collect \\"Super Emeralds\\", earned by accessing Special Stages in the Sonic & Knuckles levels after collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds from Sonic 3. When all Super Emeralds have been collected, Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails can transform into Hyper Sonic, Hyper Knuckles, and Super Tails respectively, each with unique abilities. Inserting Sonic 2 unlocks Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, wherein the player can play Sonic 2 using Knuckles' abilities. If the player attaches any other Genesis game released prior to Sonic & Knuckles, a screen with Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Robotnik stating \\"No Way!\\" is displayed. From here, the player can also access a minigame based on Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles Chaos Emerald Special Stages. The attached cartridge determines the Special Stage layout. If the player attaches the original Sonic the Hedgehog, they are able to access all of the possible variations of the special stages, each with a unique level number and corresponding password. This game is named Blue Sphere in Sonic Mega Collection.  Plot  The story begins immediately after the events of Sonic 3, where Dr. Robotnik's orbital weapon, the Death Egg, is damaged in a battle with Sonic and crash-lands back onto Angel Island. Sonic travels through each zone looking to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to defeat Robotnik, and once again comes into conflict with Knuckles, who believes Sonic is trying to steal the Emeralds for himself. In Hidden Palace Zone, Sonic fights and defeats Knuckles. The two hear a disturbance outside of the chamber, and go out to find Dr. Robotnik stealing the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Knuckles attempts to attack Robotnik, but is electrically shocked in the process, and is trapped with Sonic in an underground passage. Knuckles, realizing Sonic is on his side, shows him a portal that leads them to Sky Sanctuary, where the Death Egg is relaunching. Sonic proceeds to infiltrate the Death Egg, and defeats Robotnik as Super Sonic. Knuckles' story, which takes place after the events of Sonic's campaign, begins in Mushroom Hill, where he is relaxing with his animal friends but is interrupted by a bomb dropped by EggRobo. This prompts Knuckles to chase after him, leading him through more difficult versions of most of the same zones Sonic went through. The chase ends at the damaged remains of Sky Sanctuary, where a robot called Mecha Sonic attacks Knuckles but accidentally destroys EggRobo instead. After a short fight, Mecha Sonic uses the power of the Master Emerald to achieve a Super form similar to Sonic's. Knuckles manages to defeat Super Mecha Sonic, who explodes. Sonic flies in piloting the biplane Tornado and Knuckles hitches a ride to return the Master Emerald to Angel Island. If all the Chaos Emeralds are collected, Angel Island rises upwards, into the sky. However, if the player has not collected all the Chaos Emeralds, Knuckles cannot redeem the Master Emerald, and Angel Island plummets into the ocean.  Development and release  The Sonic & Knuckles cartridge features a \\"lock-on\\" adapter that allows it to be physically attached to other Genesis cartridges. Sonic & Knuckles was developed in California by the Japanese members of Sega Technical Institute (STI). Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles were originally planned as a single game; according to designer Takashi Iizuka, the team \\"really wanted to hit a home run\\", with larger stages that took longer to develop. As ROM cartridges were too small to contain the game and publisher Sega wanted it released in time for a promotional deal with McDonald's, Sonic 3 was split in two, with Sonic & Knuckles as the second part. Despite the split, the developers wanted the games to feel like a single experience. According to Roger Hector, vice president and general manager of STI, the lock-on technology was conceived two and a half years before the release of Sonic & Knuckles, between the releases of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The team explained their situation to Sega's hardware division, which gave them the lock-on adapter. The team knew that players would likely use the adapter to insert games beside Sonic 3, so they implemented the Blue Sphere minigame for most games. They made Knuckles playable in Sonic 2 if that game was inserted because the team found his playstyle suited its levels. However, the team did not implement the same feature for the original Sonic the Hedgehog as it \\"didn't really feel right\\". Sonic & Knuckles was released worldwide on October 18, 1994. The game was backed by a $45 million marketing campaign; at the time, video games typically had a marketing budget of $5 million. It was released around the same time as Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country for the Genesis's competitor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Industry figures called the coinciding releases a \\"battle\\" as both advertised revolutionary technological advances (lock-on technology for Sonic & Knuckles and 3D-rendered graphics for Donkey Kong). Blockbuster Video and MTV co- sponsored a tournament in which children were allowed to play Sonic & Knuckles. The final tournament was held at Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, California, with a prize of $25,000 and the title \\"The World's Most Hardcore Gamer\\". Two finalists were also awarded a copy of every Sega product released for the next year. MTV broadcast the tournament finale along with footage of the game as \\"MTV's Rock the Rock\\".  Rereleases  Sonic & Knuckles has been released as part of numerous compilations of Sega games including Sonic Jam (1997) for the Sega Saturn; Sonic & Knuckles Collection (1997) and Sonic & Garfield Pack (1999) for the PC, Sonic Mega Collection (2002) for the Nintendo GameCube; Sonic Mega Collection Plus (2004) for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC; Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (2009) for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3; and Sonic Classic Collection (2010) for the Nintendo DS. Sonic Jam, in addition to featuring the original release, included some new \\"remix\\" options to modify the game: \\"Normal\\" mode alters the layout of rings and hazards and \\"Easy\\" mode removes certain acts entirely from the game. The version in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection does not retain the lock-on feature included in other versions of the game, because of \\"tight development times\\". The game has been re-released through the Wii's Virtual Console and Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade. Both releases are programmed such that, if any of the \\"Lock-on\\" games are also downloaded on the same account, the \\"connected\\" versions of the game are also available. For example, if one downloads Sonic & Knuckles and Sonic 2, they have the option to play the corresponding Knuckles in Sonic 2 game. When the PC version was released via the Steam software, the games were released together as Sonic 3 & Knuckles as originally intended, with the player (even if playing as Tails) simply continuing at the beginning of Sonic & Knuckles after finishing Sonic 3.  Reception  Critics praised Sonic & Knuckles, despite its similarity to its predecessor. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly named it their \\"Game of the Month\\". They lauded the lock-on technology and remarked that despite that being \\"more of the same, it still is an exceptional game.\\" A reviewer of GamePro, who gave it a perfect score, commented that the ability to play as Knuckles makes it essentially two games on a single cartridge, the game is more challenging than Sonic 3, and the ability to hook the cartridge up to Sonic 2 and 3 makes those games \\"worth playing again.\\" Next Generation called it \\"the same Sonic game that Sega has sold for the last three years, just wrapped up better and with a prettier ribbon.\\" Critics praised the lock-on technology the game offered. Lucas Thomas of IGN said it was \\"a great game on its own\\", but the lock-on feature completely revamped the overall experience. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer preferred Sonic & Knuckles to Sonic 3, stating that he could not fully appreciate its predecessor without its \\"companion piece\\". Sega Power review praised the game's harder difficulty in comparison to its predecessor and the new expansion of levels, admitting that the expansion would not have been possible had Sonic 3 been a single game. Sega Magazine review similarly praised the lock-on technology and the new innovation the unique cartridge offered, adding that Sonic & Knuckles hidden stages and bosses would strongly add to the replay value of the combined game. Reviewing the Virtual Console release, Nintendo Life writer James Newton praised its support for the old lock-on feature of the original release, claiming that the game does not truly shine without having purchased Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3 to activate this feature. Thomas praised the game for \\"impressive visuals that pushed the Genesis to its limits\\" and for the value added in the content unlocked with the lock-on technology. The Genesis version sold 1.24 million copies in the United States.  Legacy  For the series' twentieth anniversary in 2011, Sega released Sonic Generations, a game that remade aspects of various past games from the franchise. A remake of the Sky Sanctuary stage was made for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC versions of the game, while the Mushroom Hill level was remade for the Nintendo 3DS version of the game. Sonic & Sega All- Stars Racing features a track inspired by the Death Egg as downloadable content along with the Metal Sonic character. The sequel, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, featured the same race course, and an additional new one inspired by the Sky Sanctuary stage. Re-imagined versions of the Flying Battery and Lava Reef stages, along with the Blue Sphere bonus game, appear in the 2017 game Sonic Mania.

Seiches and seiche-related phenomena have been observed on lakes, reservoirs, swimming pools, bays, harbours and seas. The key requirement for formation of a seiche is that the body of water be at least partially bounded, allowing the formation of the standing wave. The term was promoted by the Swiss hydrologist Fran√ßois-Alphonse Forel in 1890, who was the first to make scientific observations of the effect in Lake Geneva, Switzerland. The word originates in a Swiss French dialect word that means \\"to sway back and forth\\", which had apparently long been used in the region to describe oscillations in alpine lakes. According to Wilson (1972), this Swiss French dialect word comes from the Latin word ‚Äúsiccus‚Äù meaning \\"to dry\\", i.e. as the water recedes, the beach dries. The term is probably also related to the French word \\"s√®che\\". Seiches in harbours can be caused by long period or infragravity waves, which are due to subharmonic nonlinear wave interaction with the wind waves, having periods longer than the accompanying wind-generated waves. A standing wave (black) depicted as a sum of two propagating waves traveling in opposite directions (blue and red). Causes and nature Seiches are often imperceptible to the naked eye, and observers in boats on the surface may not notice that a seiche is occurring due to the extremely long wavelengths. The effect is caused by resonances in a body of water that has been disturbed by one or more factors, most often meteorological effects (wind and atmospheric pressure variations), seismic activity, or tsunamis.Tsunamis are normally associated with earthquakes, but landslides, volcanic eruptions and meteorite impacts all have the potential to generate a tsunami. Gravity always seeks to restore the horizontal surface of a body of liquid water, as this represents the configuration in which the water is in hydrostatic equilibrium. Vertical harmonic motion results, producing an impulse that travels the length of the basin at a velocity that depends on the depth of the water. The impulse is reflected back from the end of the basin, generating interference. Repeated reflections produce standing waves with one or more nodes, or points, that experience no vertical motion. The frequency of the oscillation is determined by the size of the basin, its depth and contours, and the water temperature. The longest natural period of a seiche is the period associated with the fundamental resonance for the body of water‚Äîcorresponding to the longest standing wave. For a surface seiche in an enclosed rectangular body of water this can be estimated using Merian's formula: : T = \\\\frac{2L}{\\\\sqrt{g h}} where T is the longest natural period, L is the length, h the average depth of the body of water, and g the acceleration of gravity.As an example, the period for a seiche wave in a body of water 10 meters deep and 5 kilometers long would be 1000 seconds or about 17 minutes, while a body about 300 km long (such as the Gulf of Finland) and somewhat deeper has a period closer to 12 hours. Higher order harmonics are also observed. The period of the second harmonic will be half the natural period, the period of the third harmonic will be a third of the natural period, and so forth. Occurrence Seiches have been observed on both lakes and seas. The key requirement is that the body of water be partially constrained to allow formation of standing waves. Regularity of geometry is not required; even harbours with exceedingly irregular shapes are routinely observed to oscillate with very stable frequencies. Lake seiches Low rhythmic seiches are almost always present on larger lakes. They are usually unnoticeable among the common wave patterns, except during periods of unusual calm. Harbours, bays, and estuaries are often prone to small seiches with amplitudes of a few centimetres and periods of a few minutes. The original studies in Lake Geneva by Fran√ßois-Alphonse Forel found the longitudinal period to have a 73-minute cycle, and the transversal seiche to have a period of around 10 minutes. Other lakes well known for their regular seiches is New Zealand's Lake Wakatipu, which varies its surface height at Queenstown by 20 centimetres in a 27-minute cycle. Seiches can also form in semi-enclosed seas; the North Sea often experiences a lengthwise seiche with a period of about 36 hours. Differences in water level caused by a seiche on Lake Erie, recorded between Buffalo, New York (red) and Toledo, Ohio (blue) on November 14, 2003 The National Weather Service issues low water advisories for portions of the Great Lakes when seiches of 2 feet or greater are likely to occur. Lake Erie is particularly prone to wind-caused seiches because of its shallowness and its elongation on a northeast-southwest axis, which frequently matches the direction of prevailing winds and therefore maximises the fetch of those winds. These can lead to extreme seiches of up to between the ends of the lake. The effect is similar to a storm surge like that caused by hurricanes along ocean coasts, but the seiche effect can cause oscillation back and forth across the lake for some time. In 1954, the remnants of Hurricane Hazel piled up water along the northwestern Lake Ontario shoreline near Toronto, causing extensive flooding, and established a seiche that subsequently caused flooding along the south shore. Lake seiches can occur very quickly: on July 13, 1995, a large seiche on Lake Superior caused the water level to fall and then rise again by three feet (one metre) within fifteen minutes, leaving some boats hanging from the docks on their mooring lines when the water retreated.Ben Korgen. Bonanza for Lake Superior: Seiches Do More Than Move Water. Retrieved on 2008-01-31 The same storm system that caused the 1995 seiche on Lake Superior produced a similar effect in Lake Huron, in which the water level at Port Huron changed by over two hours. On Lake Michigan, eight fishermen were swept away from piers at Montrose and North Avenue Beaches and drowned when a seiche hit the Chicago waterfront on June 26, 1954.Illinois State Geological Survey. Seiches: Sudden, Large Waves a Lake Michigan Danger. Retrieved on 2008-01-31. Lakes in seismically active areas, such as Lake Tahoe in California/Nevada, are significantly at risk from seiches. Geological evidence indicates that the shores of Lake Tahoe may have been hit by seiches and tsunamis as much as high in prehistoric times, and local researchers have called for the risk to be factored into emergency plans for the region. Earthquake-generated seiches can be observed thousands of miles away from the epicentre of a quake. Swimming pools are especially prone to seiches caused by earthquakes, as the ground tremors often match the resonant frequencies of small bodies of water. The 1994 Northridge earthquake in California caused swimming pools to overflow across southern California. The massive Good Friday earthquake that hit Alaska in 1964 caused seiches in swimming pools as far away as Puerto Rico. The earthquake that hit Lisbon, Portugal in 1755 caused seiches away in Loch Lomond, Loch Long, Loch Katrine and Loch Ness in Scotland and in canals in Sweden. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake caused seiches in standing water bodies in many Indian states as well as in Bangladesh, Nepal and northern Thailand.In fact, \\"one person drowned in a pond as a result of a seiche in Nadia, West Bengal\\". Seiches were again observed in Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal in India as well as in many locations in Bangladesh during the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. The 1950 Assam‚ÄìTibet earthquake is known to have generated seiches as far away as Norway and southern England. Other earthquakes in the Indian sub-continent known to have generated seiches include the 1803 Kumaon-Barahat, 1819 Allah Bund, 1842 Central Bengal, 1905 Kangra, 1930 Dhubri, 1934 Nepal-Bihar, 2001 Bhuj, 2005 Nias, 2005 Teresa Island earthquakes. The February 27, 2010 Chile earthquake produced a seiche on Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana with a height of around 0.5 feet. The 2010 Sierra El Mayor earthquake produced large seiches that quickly became an internet phenomenon. Seiches up to at least 1.8 m (6 feet) were observed in Sognefjorden, Norway during the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake in Japan.Fjorden svinga av skjelvet Retrieved on 2011-03-17. Sea and bay seiches Seiches have been observed in seas such as the Adriatic Sea and the Baltic Sea. This results in the flooding of Venice and St. Petersburg, respectively, as both cities are constructed on former marshland. In St. Petersburg, seiche-induced flooding is common along the Neva River in the autumn. The seiche is driven by a low pressure region in the North Atlantic moving onshore, giving rise to cyclonic lows on the Baltic Sea. The low pressure of the cyclone draws greater-than-normal quantities of water into the virtually land-locked Baltic. As the cyclone continues inland, long, low- frequency seiche waves with wavelengths up to several hundred kilometres are established in the Baltic. When the waves reach the narrow and shallow Neva Bay, they become much higher ‚Äî ultimately flooding the Neva embankments.This behaves in a fashion similar to a tidal bore where incoming tides are funneled into a shallow, narrowing river via a broad bay. The funnel-like shape increases the height of the tide above normal, and the flood appears as a relatively rapid increase in the water level. Similar phenomena are observed at Venice, resulting in the MOSE Project, a system of 79 mobile barriers designed to protect the three entrances to the Venetian Lagoon. Nagasaki Bay is a typical area in Japan where seiches have been observed from time to time, most often in the spring ‚Äî especially in March. On 31 March 1979, the Nagasaki tide station recorded a maximum water-level displacement of , at that location due to the seiche. The maximum water-level displacement in the whole bay during this seiche event is assumed to have reached , at the bottom of the bay. Seiches in Western Kyushu ‚Äî including Nagasaki Bay ‚Äî are often induced by a low in the atmospheric pressure passing South of Kyushu island. Seiches in Nagasaki Bay have a period of about 30 to 40 minutes. Locally, is called . The word of abiki is considered to have been derived from , which literally means: the dragging-away () of a fishing net (). Seiches not only cause damage to the local fishery but also may result in flooding of the coast around the bay, as well as in the destruction of port facilities. On occasion, tsunamis can produce seiches as a result of local geographic peculiarities. For instance, the tsunami that hit Hawaii in 1946 had a fifteen-minute interval between wave fronts. The natural resonant period of Hilo Bay is about thirty minutes. That meant that every second wave was in phase with the motion of Hilo Bay, creating a seiche in the bay. As a result, Hilo suffered worse damage than any other place in Hawaii, with the combined tsunami and seiche reaching a height of 26 feet along the Hilo Bayfront, killing 96 people in the city alone. Seiche waves may continue for several days after a tsunami. Tide-generated internal solitary waves (solitons) can excite coastal seiches at the following locations: Magueyes Island in Puerto Rico, Puerto Princesa in Palawan Island, Trincomalee Bay in Sri Lanka, and in the Bay of Fundy in eastern Canada, where seiches cause some of the highest recorded tidal fluctuations in the world. A dynamical mechanism exists for the generation of coastal seiches by deep-sea internal waves. These waves can generate a sufficient current at the shelf break to excite coastal seiches. Illustration of the initiation of surface and subsurface thermocline seiches. Underwater (internal) waves Seiches are also observed beneath the lake surface acting along the thermoclineThe thermocline is the boundary between colder lower layer (hypolimnion) and warmer upper layer (epilimnion). in constrained bodies of water. In analogy with the Merian formula, the expected period of the internal wave can be expressed as:Mortimer, C. H. (1974). Lake hydrodynamics. Mitt. Internat. Verein. Limnol. 20, 124‚Äì197. : T = \\\\frac{2L}{c} with c^2 = g \\\\frac{\\\\rho_2-\\\\rho_1}{\\\\rho_2} \\\\frac{h_1 h_2}{h_1+h_2} where T is the natural period, L is the length of the water body, h_1, h_2 the average thicknesses of the two layers separated by stratification (e.g. epilimnion and hypolimnion), \\\\rho_1, \\\\rho_2 the densities of these two same layers and g the acceleration of gravity. As the thermocline moves up and down a sloping lake bed, it creates a 'swash zone' on the lake bed where temperatures can rapidly vary, potentially influencing fish habitat usage. As the thermocline rises up a sloping lake bed, it can also cause enhance benthic turbulence by convective overturning, whereas the falling thermocline experiences greater stratification and low turbulence at the lake bed. Internal waves can also degenerate into non-linear internal waves on sloping lake-beds. When such non- linear waves break on the lake bed, they can be an important source of turbulence and have the potential for sediment resuspension Engineering for seiche protection Engineers consider seiche phenomena in the design of flood protection works (e.g., Saint Petersburg Dam), reservoirs and dams (e.g., Grand Coulee Dam), potable water storage basins, harbours and even spent nuclear fuel storage basins.

It is a successor to the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America (PFNA). PCCNA headquarters are in Los Angeles, California. History=Pentecostal Fellowship of North America The Pentecostal Fellowship of North America was formed by eight Pentecostal denominations in 1948 at Des Moines, Iowa. Before the Des Moines meeting, a rally was held in Washington, D.C., and plans for a constitution were formulated. Two of the leading figures of the Washington meeting were Bishop Joseph A. Synan and Oral Roberts. The following were charter members of the PFNA: *Assemblies of God USA *Church of God (Cleveland) *International Church of the Foursquare Gospel *International Pentecostal Holiness Church *Open Bible Standard Churches Racial reconciliation and inclusion of charismatics The Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America was formed as part of a unification of charismatic and Pentecostal bodies and a movement toward racial reconciliation. Whereas the PFNA was formed to help bridge doctrinal divisions, the PCCNA set a broader goal of also the racial and cultural gaps. At a meeting in 1994 in Memphis, Tennessee, the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America was dissolved, and the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America was formed. We are gathered here in Memphis, Tennessee, to return to our roots and to recapture the initiative of the Spirit. This will be a time of repentance for the sins of the past. This will be a time of forgiveness as we rely upon the wonderful grace of our loving Heavenly Father and mirror that grace in our relationships with one another. The time has come for reconciliation! The time has come to recapture our heritage! We gather here as the children of God and heirs of the twentieth century Pentecostal/charismatic renewal of the church. Our Father has called us to unity. - from an address of Bishop B. E. Underwood, Chairman of the PFNA, October, 1994 PURPOSES #To relate to one another as members of the body of Christ. #To demonstrate the essential unity of Spirit-filled believers in answer to the prayer of Jesus in John 17:21, ‚ÄúThat they all may be one.‚Äù #To foster the evangelization of the world through the preaching of the gospel, with signs and wonders and the demonstration of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, by presenting Jesus Christ as the only Savior, Baptizer in the Holy Spirit, Healer, and Coming King.

The program originated on MS-DOS, then ported to the Atari ST, Linux, and Macintosh. During the early 1990s, Fractint was the definitive fractal generating program for personal computers. The name is a portmanteau of fractal and integer, since the first versions of Fractint used only integer arithmetic (also known as fixed-point arithmetic), for faster rendering on computers without math coprocessors. Since then, floating-point arithmetic and arbitrary-precision arithmetic modes have been added. Features FractInt can draw most kinds of fractals that have appeared in the literature. It also has a few \\"fractal types\\" that are not strictly speaking fractals, but may be more accurately described as display hacks. These include cellular automata. History A Mandelbrot fractal with Fractint's colour palette editor (version 20.0 in DOSBOX 0.72 on Vista). contains near copies of itself. Fractint originally appeared in 1988 as FRACT386, a computer program for rendering fractals very quickly on the Intel 80386 processor using integer arithmetic. Most 386 processors of the era did not come with floating point units (Intel 80387), so the integer approach was much faster. The early versions of FRACT386 were written by Bert Tyler, who based it on a Mandelbrot generator for a TI-based processor that used integer math and decided to try programming something similar for his 386 machine.Tyler, Bert and Wegner, Timothy, Fractal Creations, 2nd edition, Waite Group Press, 1993, , p. 461 In February 1989, the program was renamed Fractint. In July 1990, it was ported to the Atari ST with the math routines rewritten in Motorola 68000 assembly language by Howard Chu.

Much of the mountain is designated a national park, and is a protected habitat for wildfowl, first created in 1961. The summit is located 18 km north of Acharnae and about 30 km north of Athens city centre, while the mountain covers approximately 250 km¬≤ of land. Other peaks include Mavrovouni (ŒúŒ±œÖœÅŒøŒ≤ŒøœçŒΩŒπ), Ornio (1,350 m), Area (1,160 m), Avgo or Avgho (1,150 m), and Xerovouni (ŒûŒµœÅŒøŒ≤ŒøœçŒΩŒπ, meaning \\"dry mountain\\": 1,120 m). It also has two shelters Mpafi and Flampouri.Parnitha National park, official site. The name of the mountain dates back to ancient times, when it was under the ancient demes of Acharnae and Decelea.  Geography  A satellite view of Parnitha along with most of Attica, the boundary is marked in light blue Towns surrounding the mountain include Aspropyrgos, Fyli, Acharnes, Varymbombi, Thrakomakedones, Dekeleia, Avlona and Agios Stefanos as well as the settlement of Agios Merkourios. The highway GR-1 (E75) surrounds the northern and eastern part of the mountain along with the Cephissus river, while the Attiki Odos motorway (GR-6) runs to its south. The mountain offers panoramic views of the mountains northeast of Parnitha, Penteli to the east, the Ymittos to the southeast, the Aigaleo to the south and another to the west; from its summit, one can also see the Thriasian Plain, the Saronic Gulf including the islands of Salamina, Aigina and the North, the South Euboean Gulfs and island of Euboea, and most of central and northern Greater Athens. The view during clear days can extend to northern Boeotia and the Peloponnese. The mountain was also affected by several major blizzards, including two in 2005 and 2006, stranding cars and closing roads, as well as the cable car. Ecology Forests of Aleppo Pine cover all slopes beneath 1,000 m altitude, and are often threatened by forest fires, such as happened in 2005 and 2007. Above 1,000 m it is covered principally in Greek Fir, grasses and shrubbery, and beneath 300 m mainly farmlands and suburban housing to the east. About 1,000 species of plants can be found on the mountain, including crocus and tulips, and the mountain also provides a native habitat to its red deer (Cervus elaphus), which were known in ancient times. After the traumatic fire in 2007 (see below), they are even scarcer. Several large mines lie to the northwest, and the ore from them was shipped to a nearby factory in industrial areas. Historical monuments and places of interest Monastery of Kleiston in Parnitha Parnitha has many places with archaeological interest. Most usual ancient buildings in Parnitha are the fortresses. In antiquity, many fortresses had been built on the mountain, for the Athenian defense against the Boeotians and others enemies from the north. Today some fortresses are kept in good condition such as the Phyle fortress, at a height of 687 meters in the west of Parnitha. Other notable fortresses are the Panakton, in the area of Dervenochoria and Eleutherae fortress near Mount Cithaeron. A notable monument of later periods is the Monastery of Kleiston. It is a Byzantine monastery dated from 13th century. It is mentioned by Pope Innocent IV in 1209 with the name Monastery of Kyras. Southeast of Parnitha, in a dense forest, is Tatoi Palace. It was the palace of the Greek royal family and it was built in 19th century. Today it is abandoned. Beletsi Lake on the east slopes of Parnitha Parnitha has also natural monuments. The cave of Panas is on the west slopes of the mountain at a height of 750 meters. It was a worship site in antiquity. Near the cave there is the steep gorge of Gouras and the gorge of Keladonas river. A beautiful site of the mountain is Beletsi Lake, on the east slopes of the mountain, near Afidnes, and it is important place for migratory birds. Modern facilities A casino, the Mont Parnes Casino, is located near the top of the mountain and is served by a suspended cable car. Two shelters are also on Parnitha, the most known of which is Mpafi. A series of trails are found around the mountain as well as forest roads, and also on the mountain is Athens' second transmitter, broadcasting radio and television since the mid-1950s, across the range of television channels from ERT, ANT1, Mega, Alter and more, to satellite, including Super Sport, Seven X and Filmnet, and a multitude of radio including ERA Radio, Klik FM, ANT1 Radio, Ciao FM, Rhythmos, Super Sport FM, Top FM and others. The supporting road connection was paved in the mid-20th century.  2007 wildfire View of the fire from the East Parnitha during 2007 wildfire A very small part of the burned area Parnitha suffered extensive damage from a wildfire on Thursday, 28 June 2007 around the morning and noon hours, continuing for several days and burning approximately 56 km¬≤ of land; one of the worst recorded wildfires in the prefecture after that of Penteli. The magnitude of the devastation was unforeseen. A smaller fire had, however, taken place in the 1960s. The fire consumed forests in two prefectures. Firefighters, helicopters, and planes were brought into action across the mountain area and its edges fighting the enormous blaze, which took days to contain. It spread rapidly with the help of intense winds, and intensified into the northwestern edges of Greater Athens, including both Ano Liosia and towns and villages such as Fyli, near Thrakomakedones, Pyli and both Skoura and Schimatari north of the mountain. From Athens, inhabitants could see the mountainside burning throughout the night. In Schimatari in Boeotia, it ruined several acres of forest and businesses. The fire claimed 80% of the rare Greek Fir and Aleppo Pine forest, 150 animals of the red deer population (an endangered species), birds, and other rare animals. The remains of the green firs and pines are scattered around its edges. The smoke from the massive destruction formed a line that traveled east over Attica, southern Euboea, Chios, to the edge of Turkey, approximately 350 km away. On June 30, the fire was mostly contained and warnings of new fires were reduced, as only a few fires were slowly burning sporadically in separate parts of the mountain. The main blaze was completely put out on July 1. At the edges of the burnt parts, several fires slowly continued to burn in sections after June 30, with a slow expansion. Scientists estimate that the area's recovery time may be as long as a century. They predict the effect of the loss will only begin to be felt in the coming years; the air may become a little stale and the already known problems of air pollution and smog in Athens may reappear and intensify. Temperatures could also rise and flooding may become a problem for several years. The Ministry of Environment is currently considering a conclusive reforestation program, while many citizens plan to march on the streets of Athens to express their disapproval of the handling of the situation. More recently, forestation has been underway, and the government will be receiving tens of thousands of trees to be planted around the mountains, most of them from outside the country. Investigations are still underway as to the fire's cause. One scenario suggests a transformer belonging to a major power line exploded due to overuse and overheating by the 47C heatwave, some days before the fire. Another holds that this was one of the many arson attacks that have claimed forested land in Greece over recent decades.

Some simply refer to it as a case of not being moral or immoral. Amoral should not be confused with immoral, which refers to an agent doing or thinking something they know or believe to be wrong. Morality and amorality in humans and animals is a subject of dispute among scientists and philosophers. If morality is intrinsic to humanity, then amoral human beings either do not exist or are only deficiently human. If morality is extrinsic to humanity, then amoral human beings can both exist and be fully human, and as such be amoral by default. There is a position that claims amorality is just another form of morality or a concept that is close to it, citing the cases of moral naturalism, moral constructivism, moral relativism, and moral fictionalism as varieties that resemble key aspects of amorality.  Rocks  Any entity that is not sapient may be considered categorically amoral. For example, a rock may be used (by rational agents) for good or bad purposes, but the rock itself is neither good nor bad. In ontological philosophy, the ancient gnostic concept that the material world was inherently evil applied morality to existence itself and was a point of concern in early Christianity in the form of Docetism, as it opposed the notion that creation is good, as stated in The Book of Genesis. In modern science, however, the matter of the universe is often observed amorally for objective purposes.  Animals  Animals have long been thought to be amoral entities. However, research into the evolution of morality, including sociality and altruism in animals, has sparked new debate amongst many philosophers. Many animals display behavior that is analogous to human moral behavior, such as caring for the young, protecting kin, and sharing the spoils of the hunt. Generally speaking, if this behavior is a voluntary response to ethical norms, then animals do have morality. If animals are involuntarily following innate instinct, then they are amoral.  Legal entities  Corporations to some, are thought to be amoral entities. This can refer to the \\"ethical numbness\\" of these organizations' executives and managers especially when approached from the view that corporations can be considered moral agents as well as a kind of legal person.

The prosecution is the legal party responsible for presenting the case in a criminal trial against an individual accused of breaking the law. Typically, the prosecutor represents the government in the case brought against the accused person.  Prosecutor as a legal professional  Prosecutors are typically lawyers who possess a law degree, and are recognized as legal professionals by the court in which they intend to represent society (that is, they have been admitted to the bar). They usually only become involved in a criminal case once a suspect has been identified and charges need to be filed. They are typically employed by an office of the government, with safeguards in place to ensure such an office can successfully pursue the prosecution of government officials. Often, multiple offices exist in a single country, especially in those countries with federal governments where sovereignty has been bifurcated or devolved in some way. Since prosecutors are backed by the power of the state, they are usually subject to special professional responsibility rules in addition to those binding all lawyers. For example, in the United States, Rule 3.8 of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct requires prosecutors to \\"make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense.\\" Not all U.S. states adopt the model rules; however, U.S. Supreme Court cases and other appellate cases have ruled that such disclosure is required. Typical sources of ethical requirements imposed on prosecutors come from appellate court opinions, state or federal court rules, and state or federal statutes (codified laws). Directors of public prosecutions In Australia, Canada, England and Wales, Hong Kong, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Trinidad & Tobago, Guyana, Kenya, and South Africa, the head of the prosecuting authority is typically known as the director of public prosecutions (DPP) and is appointed, not elected. A DPP may be subject to varying degrees of control by the attorney general, usually by a formal written directive which must be published. In Australia, the Offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions institute prosecutions for indictable offences on behalf of the Crown.See Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth). At least in the case of very serious matters, the DPP will be asked by the police, during the course of the investigation, to advise them on sufficiency of evidence, and may well be asked, if he or she thinks it proper, to prepare an application to the relevant court for search, listening device or telecommunications interception warrants. More recent constitutions, such as South Africa's, tend to guarantee the independence and impartiality of the DPP. Common law jurisdictions=Australia Prosecutors in Australia come in a few distinct species. Prosecutors of minor criminal cases in lower courts, are usually Police Sergeants with a traineeship in prosecution and advocacy lasting approximately 1 year in duration, although they may hold law degrees. Crown Prosecutors are always lawyers, and typically barristers, and they represent the State or Commonwealth in serious criminal cases in higher courts, County Court and above. Aside from Police prosecutors and Crown prosecutors, government agencies usually have the authority to appoint non- lawyers to prosecute on their behalf, such as the RSPCA Inspectors. Canada In Canada, public prosecutors in most provinces are called Crown Attorney or Crown Counsel. They are generally appointed by the provincial Attorney-General. Scotland Though Scots law is a mixed system, its civil law jurisdiction indicates its civil law heritage. Here, all prosecutions are carried out by Procurators Fiscal and Advocates Depute on behalf of the Lord Advocate, and, in theory, they can direct investigations by the police. In very serious cases, a Procurator Fiscal, Advocate Depute or even the Lord Advocate, may take charge of a police investigation. It is at the discretion of the Procurator Fiscal, Advocate Depute, or Lord Advocate to take a prosecution to court, and to decide on whether or not to prosecute it under solemn procedure or summary procedure. Other remedies are open to a prosecutor in Scotland, including fiscal fines and non-court based interventions, such as rehabilitation and social work. All prosecutions are handled within the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. Procurators fiscal will usually refer cases involving minors to Children's Hearings, which are not courts of law, but a panel of lay members empowered to act in the interests of the child. United States The United States is the only country in the world where citizens elect prosecutors. The original argument for elected prosecutors was to prevent governors and legislators from using the appointment system for political patronage. But not long after prosecutors started to become elected (mostly between 1832 and 1861), they became involved in and co-opted by partisan politics. The Origins of the Elected Prosecutor by Michael J. Ellis. Yale Law Journal. 01/2012 According to critics, elections subject prosecutors to political influence, lead them to concentrate on high-profile investigations to win favorable media coverage, have the potential to corrupt prosecutors with campaign contributions, and result in them seeking higher conviction rates. Elections place pressure on prosecutors to deliver convictions instead of primarily seeking justice, i.e., elections favor candidates that promise to be tougher on crime, which sounds good to almost all voters because they see themselves primarily as possible victims of crime rather than as potential defendants.A Pendulum Swung Too Far: Why the Supreme Court Must Place Limits on Prosecutorial Immunity by Malia N. Brink. Charleston Law Review. Volume 4, Fall 2009, Number 1, p. 13 This also results in systemic racism because 95% of elected prosecutors are white so that non whites are not only overrepresented in the prison population but also underrepresented among prosecutors.It‚Äôs Too Dangerous to Elect Prosecutors The director of a prosecution office is known by any of several names depending on the jurisdiction, most commonly district attorney. Other names include state's attorney, state attorney, and commonwealth's attorney. The prosecution is the legal party responsible for presenting the case against an individual or a corporation suspected of breaking the law, initiating and directing further criminal investigations, guiding and recommending the sentencing of offenders, and are the only attorneys allowed to participate in grand jury proceedings. Standards on Prosecutorial Investigations The titles of prosecutors in state courts vary from state to state and level of government (i.e. city, county, and state) and include the terms District Attorney in New York, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Wisconsin, Oregon, and Oklahoma;See: :Category:District attorneys. City Attorney in California cities (typically prosecute only minor and misdemeanor offenses) Commonwealth's Attorney in Kentucky and Virginia; County Attorney in Nebraska, Minnesota, and Arizona; County Prosecutor in New Jersey, Ohio, and Indiana; District Attorney General in Tennessee; Prosecuting Attorney in Arkansas,See, e.g., Ark. Const. amdt. 21, ¬ß 1 (offenses may be prosecuted by an \\"information filed by the Prosecuting Attorney\\"), and amdt. 80, ¬ß 20 (\\"A Prosecuting Attorney shall be elected by the qualified electors of each judicial circuit.\\"); Ark. Code Ann. ¬ß¬ß 16-21-101 et seq. (provisions concerning \\"prosecuting attorneys\\"). Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Washington, and West Virginia (as well as in Missouri where cities additionally use \\"City Attorneys\\" to prosecute on their behalf); State's Attorney in Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, North Dakota, and Vermont; State Prosecutor; Attorney General in Delaware and Rhode Island; and Solicitor in South Carolina. Prosecutors are most often chosen through local elections, and typically hire other attorneys as deputies or assistants to conduct most of the actual work of the office. United States Attorneys are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. They represent the federal government in federal court in both civil and criminal cases. Private attorneys general can bring criminal cases on behalf of private parties in some states. Prosecutors are required by state and federal laws to follow certain rules. For example, the government must disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense;. must disclose matters affecting the credibility of prosecution witnesses, such as an agreement to dismiss the witness's own charges in exchange for her testimony;. must not destroy potentially useful evidence in bad faith;. and must not use false testimony to secure a conviction.. Failure to follow these rules may result in a finding of prosecutorial misconduct, although a 2013 investigation found that actual discipline for prosecutorial misconduct was lacking.Who Polices Prosecutors Who Abuse Their Authority? Usually Nobody . ProPublica. Prosecutors are also tasked with seeking justice in their prosecutions. \\"The United States Attorney,\\" explained the U.S. Supreme Court, > is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a > sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its > obligation to govern at all, and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal > prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. > As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, > the two-fold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence > suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor‚Äîindeed, he should do so. > But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul > ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to > produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to > bring about a just one.. Prosecutors in some jurisdictions have the discretion to not pursue criminal charges, even when there is probable cause, if they determine that there is no reasonable likelihood of conviction.See . Prosecutors may dismiss charges in this situation by seeking a voluntary dismissal or nolle prosequi. In Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the Commonwealth. In California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, and New York, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the People. In the remaining states, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the State.  Civil law jurisdictions  Prosecutors are typically civil servants who possess a university degree in law and additional training in the administration of justice. In some countries, such as France and Italy, they belong to the same corps of civil servants as the judges.  Belgium  In Belgium, the Senior Crown prosecutor (Procureur du Roi/Procureur des Konings in trial courts and Procureur G√©n√©ral/Procureur-Generaal in appellate courts) is supported by subordinate Crown prosecutors (substituts/substituten). They open preliminary investigations and can hold a suspect in custody for up to 24 hours. When necessary, a Crown prosecutor will request an examining judge (juge d'instruction/onderzoeksrechter) be appointed to lead a judicial inquest. With a judge investigating, Crown prosecutors do not conduct the interrogatories, but simply lay out the scope of the crimes which the judge and law enforcement forces investigate (la saisine). Like defense counsel, Crown prosecutors can request or suggest further investigation be carried out. The Crown prosecutor is in charge of policy decisions and may prioritize cases and procedures as need be. During a criminal trial, prosecutors must introduce and explain the case to the trier of fact, i.e., judges or jury. They generally suggest a reasonable sentence which the court is not obligated to follow; the court may decide on a tougher or softer sentence. Crown prosecutors also have a number of administrative duties. They may advise the court during civil actions. Under Belgian law, judges and prosecutors are judicial officers with equal rank and pay. The Minister of Justice can order a criminal investigation but cannot prevent one (droit d'injonction positive/positief injunctierecht).  Brazil  In Brazil, the public prosecutors form a body of autonomous civil servants‚Äîthe Public Ministry (Minist√©rio P√∫blico)‚Äîworking both at the federal and state level. Federal prosecutors (procuradores da Rep√∫blica) are divided in three ranks, according to the jurisdiction of the courts before which they officiate. Procuradores da Rep√∫blica officiate before single judges and lower courts, procuradores regionais da Rep√∫blica before federal appellate courts, and subprocuradores gerais da Rep√∫blica before the superior federal courts. The Procurador Geral da Rep√∫blica heads the federal body, and tries cases before the Supremo Tribunal Federal. At the state level, the career is usually divided in promotores de Justi√ßa who practice before the lower courts and procuradores de Justi√ßa who practice before the state courts of appeals. There are also military prosecutors whose career, although linked to the federal prosecutors, is divided in a manner similar to state prosecutors. In Brazil the prosecutors' main job is to promote justice, as such they have the duty of not only trying criminal cases, but, if during the trial, they become convinced of a defendant's innocence, requesting the judge to acquit him. The prosecutor's office has always the last word on whether criminal offenses will or will not be charged, with the exception of those rare cases in which Brazilian law allows for private prosecution. In such cases, the prosecutor will officiate as custos legis, being responsible to ensure that justice is indeed carried out. Although empowered by law to do so, prosecutors conduct criminal investigations only in major cases, usually involving police or public officials' wrongdoings. Also, they are in charge of external control over police activity and requesting the initiation of a police investigation.Article 129, preamble paragraphs VII and VIII of the (\\"S√£o fun√ß√µes institucionais do Minist√©rio P√∫blico: . . . (VII) exercer o controle externo da atividade policial, na forma da lei complementar mencionada no artigo anterior [Art. 128¬∞]; (VIII) requisitar dilig√™ncias investigat√≥rias e a instaura√ß√£o de inqu√©rito policial, indicados os fundamentos jur√≠dicos de suas manifesta√ß√µes processuais; . . . .\\"). The power of individual prosecutors to hold criminal investigations is still controversial and, although massively supported by judges, prosecutors and the general population, it is being contested before the Supremo Tribunal Federal. According to a 2012 law, the chief of police (delegado de pol√≠cia), as the police authority, is responsible for conducting the criminal investigation in Brazil by means of a police investigation (inqu√©rito policial) or other procedure provided by law that has the purpose of ascertaining the circumstances, materiality, and authorship of criminal offenses.. Similar provisions are found in the Code of Criminal ProcedureArticle 4 of the (\\"A pol√≠cia judici√°ria ser√° exercida pelas autoridades policiais no territ√≥rio de suas respectivas circunscri√ß√µes e ter√° por fim a apura√ß√£o das infra√ß√µes penais e da sua autoria.\\"). and in article 144 of the federal constitution. (\\"√Äs pol√≠cias civis, dirigidas por delegados de pol√≠cia de carreira, incumbem, ressalvada a compet√™ncia da Uni√£o, as fun√ß√µes de pol√≠cia judici√°ria e a apura√ß√£o de infra√ß√µes penais, exceto as militares.\\"). Beside their criminal duties, Brazilian prosecutors are among those authorized by the Brazilian constitution to bring action against private individuals, commercial enterprises, and the federal, state and municipal governments, in the defense of minorities, the environment, consumers, and the civil society in general.  France  In France, the Office of the Prosecutor includes a Chief Prosecutor (Procureur de la R√©publique in trial courts and procureur g√©n√©ral in appellate courts or the Supreme Court) and his deputies and assistants (avocats g√©n√©raux and substituts). The Chief Prosecutor generally initiates preliminary investigations and, if necessary, asks that an examining judge (juge d'instruction) be assigned to lead a formal judicial investigation. When an investigation is led by a judge, the prosecutor plays a supervisory role, defining the scope of the crimes being examined by the judge and law enforcement forces. Like defense counsel, the chief prosecutor may petition or move for further investigation. During criminal proceedings, prosecutors are responsible for presenting the case at trial to either the bench or the jury. Prosecutors generally suggest advisory sentencing guidelines, but the sentence remains at the court's discretion to decide, to increase or reduce as it sees fit. In addition, prosecutors have several administrative duties. Prosecutors are considered magistrates under French law, as in most civil law countries. While the defense and the plaintiff are both represented by common lawyers, who sit (on chairs) on the courtroom floor, the prosecutor sits on a platform as the judge does, although he doesn't participate in deliberation. Judges and prosecutors are trained at the same school, and regard one other as colleagues.  Germany  In Germany, the Staatsanwalt (\\"state attorney\\") is a life-tenured public official in the senior judicial service belonging to the same corps as judges. The Staatsanwalt heads pre-trial criminal investigations, decides whether to press a charge or drop it, and represents the government in criminal courts. He not only has the \\"professional responsibility\\" not to withhold exculpatory information, but is also required by law to actively determine such circumstances and to make them available to the defendant or his/her defense attorney. If he is not convinced of the defendant's guilt, the state attorney is required to plead against or in favor of the defendant according to the prosecutor's own assessment.RiStBV, No. 138/139. Prosecution is compulsory if the prosecutor has sufficient evidence to convict.  Italy  In Italy, a Prosecutor's Office is composed of a Chief Prosecutor (procuratore capo) assisted by deputies (procuratori aggiunti) and assistants (sostituti procuratori). Prosecutors in Italy are judicial officers just like judges and are ceremonially referred to as Pubblico Ministero (\\"Public Ministry\\" or P.M.). Italian Prosecutors officiate as custos legis, being responsible to ensure that justice is indeed carried out. They are obligated under the Constitution to initiate preliminary investigations once they are informed or take personal notice of a criminal act‚Äînotitia criminis‚Äîor receive a bill of complaint. They can direct investigations or conduct them through orders and directives given to (judicial) police detectives, who can make their own parallel investigations in coordination with the Prosecutor. If enough evidence has been gathered in order to proceed, the prosecution is compulsory and it must move from preliminary investigations to initiate trial proceedings. At trial, the prosecuting attorney has to handle the prosecution but has an overarching duty to promote justice. In practice, this duty means that prosecutors are prohibited from withholding exculpatory evidence and must request that the judge acquit the defendant if, during the trial, the prosecutor becomes convinced of the defendant's innocence, or agrees that there is no evidence that proves his guilt beyond any reasonable doubt. In appellate courts, the Office of the Prosecutor is called Procura Generale and the Chief Prosecutor the Procuratore Generale (PG). The Procuratore Generale presso la Corte di Cassazione is the Chief General Prosecutor before the Corte di Cassazione, the Supreme Court of Italy. Prosecutors are allowed during their career to act in the other's stead, but a recent ruling by the Italian Constitutional Court stated that prosecutors, who wish to become judges, must relocate to another region and are prohibited to sit or hear trials that they themselves initiated.  Japan  In Japan, public prosecutors are professional officials who have considerable powers of investigation, prosecution, superintendence of criminal execution and so on. Prosecutors can direct police for investigation purposes, and sometimes investigate directly. Only prosecutors can prosecute criminals in principle, and prosecutors can decide whether to prosecute or not. High-ranking officials of the Ministry of Justice are largely prosecutors. Poland The highest ranking prosecutor office of the Prokuratura in Poland is the Prokurator Generalny (General Prosecutor)‚Äîchief of the Prokuratura Generalna (General Prosecutor Office). The GP has 5 deputies. Structure of Public Prosecutor in Poland is 4-level: General Prosecutor Office --> Appellation Prosecutor Offices (11) --> District Prosecutor Offices (46) --> Regional Prosecutor Offices (326).  South Korea  Prosecutors are the public officials who are members of the Ministry of Justice. Prosecutors can conduct crime investigations directly or indirectly. They are responsible for the entire process of investigations and court prosecutions. Since Korean modern law was designed after continental system, the role of Korean prosecutors is similar or identical to that of European equivalents in commanding investigations, determining indictable cases and prosecuting process. Korean prosecutors take pride in successful prosecutions of former presidents(1995) and sons of the incumbent presidents(1997 and 2002). Besides, they have made important contributions to convicting many corrupt high-ranking officials and business leaders. A prosecutor has the power to prohibit a defendant or an accused individual from departing the Republic of Korea via an \\"international hold\\". Sweden In Sweden, public prosecutors are lawyers who work out of the Swedish Office of Public Prosecutions (√Öklagarmyndigheten) and direct police investigations of serious crimes. For all criminal cases, public prosecutors decide arrests and charges on behalf of the public and are the only public officers who can make such decisions. Plaintiffs also have the option of hiring their own special prosecutor (enskilt √•tal). The exception is cases concerning crimes against the freedom of the press for which the Attorney General acts as the prosecuting attorney. In court, the prosecutor is not necessarily in an adversarial relationship to the defendant, but is under an obligation to investigate and present information which may incriminate or exhonerate the defendant. The prosecutor is not a judicial officer, nor do they participate in the private deliberations of the court. Public prosecutors are the only public officers who can decide to appeal cases to appellate courts (hovr√§tter). Otherwise, appeals are initiated by defense counsel, the plaintiff, their representatives, and other parties to the case (m√•ls√§ganden). When a case has been decided by an appellate court, the right to appeal to the Supreme Court passes from the case's prosecutor to the Director of Public Prosecutions (Riks√•klagaren).  Socialist law jurisdictions  A Public Procurator is an office used in Socialist judicial systems which, in some ways, corresponds to that of a public prosecutor in other legal systems, but with more far-reaching responsibilities, such as handling investigations otherwise performed by branches of the police. Conversely, the policing systems in socialist countries, such as the Militsiya of the Soviet Union, were not aimed at fulfilling the same roles as police forces in Democratic countries.  People's Republic of China  A Public Procurator is a position in the People's Republic of China, analogous to both detective and public prosecutor. Legally, they are bound by Public Procurators' Law of the People's Republic of China. According to Article 6, the functions and duties of public procurators are as follows: #Supervise the enforcement of laws according to law. #Public prosecution on behalf of the State. #Investigate criminal cases directly accepted by the People's Procuratorates as provided by law. #Other functions and duties as provided by law. Vietnam The Supreme People's Procuracy is the highest office of public procurators in Vietnam.  Institutional independence  In many countries, the prosecutor's administration is directly subordinate to the executive branch (e.g., the US Attorney General is a member of the President's cabinet). In some other countries, such as Italy or Brazil, the prosecutors are judicial civil servants, so they have the same liberties and independence that judges traditionally enjoy. In other countries, a form of private prosecution is available, meaning persons or private entities can directly petition the courts to hold trial against someone they feel is guilty of a crime, should the prosecutor refuse to indict. Private prosecution In the early history of England, victims of a crime and their family had the right to hire a private attorney to prosecute criminal charges against the person alleged to have injured the victim. In the 18th century, prosecution of almost all criminal offences in England was private, usually by the victim. In Colonial America, because of Dutch (and possibly French) practice and the expansion of the office of attorney general, public officials came to dominate the prosecution of crimes. However, privately funded prosecutors constituted a significant element of the state criminal justice system throughout the nineteenth century. The use of a private prosecutor was incorporated into the common law of Virginia, but is no longer permitted there. Private prosecutors were also used in North Carolina as late as 1975. Private prosecution has been used in Nigeria, but the practice is being phased out.. Bruce L. Benson's To Serve and Protect lauds the role of private prosecutors, often employed by prosecution associations, in serving the needs of crime victims in England. Radical libertarian theory holds that public prosecutors should not exist, but that crimes should instead be treated as civil torts. Murray Rothbard writes, \\"In a libertarian world, there would be no crimes against an ill-defined 'society,' and therefore no such person as a 'district attorney' who decides on a charge and then presses those charges against an alleged criminal.\\" See also * Public procurator * Magistrats Europ√©ens pour la D√©mocratie et les Libert√©s (European Association of Judges and Public Prosecutors).

It is the premier earldom recorded on the Union Roll.Whitaker's Almanack The title has a very complex history. Early history Sir David Lindsay, who married a daughter of Robert II, was the 10th baron of Crawford, Lanarkshire. In 1398 he was given the title of Earl of Crawford, along with Crawford Castle, by Robert.See p.61, English translation of the Latin text of the Blaeu Atlas of Scotland, 1654 in the digital library of the National Library of Scotland at . According to the translator, the original text's reference to \\"James\\" Lindsay is a mistake for David Lindsay. The title descended to the first Earl's descendants without much incident, until the death of David Lindsay, 8th Earl of Crawford, in 1542. The eighth Earl had a son, Alexander, commonly called the Wicked Master, who frequently quarreled with his father and even tried to murder him. The Wicked Master was sentenced to death for his crime, and the eighth Earl conveyed his title to a cousin, also called David Lindsay, a descendant of the third Earl of Crawford, and excluded from the succession all of the Wicked Master's descendants. However, the ninth earl, although he had his own sons, named the Wicked Master's son David as his heir; thus, in 1558, at the ninth Earl's death, the earldom returned to the main branch of the family. The ninth Earl is frequently referred to as an interpolated Earl, as are the 17th-22nd Earls. Later history At the death of Ludovic Lindsay, 16th Earl of Crawford, the title was passed, despite senior heirs, to a cousin, John, who had already been created Earl of Lindsay. The earldoms of Crawford and Lindsay continued to be united until the 22nd earl died unmarried in January 1808. The two earldoms then became dormant until the respective heirs could prove their claims to the titles. In 1843, James Lindsay, 7th Earl of Balcarres put forward his claim to the Earldom of Crawford; in 1848, the House of Lords allowed it. The claim was based on the extensive research of his son Lord Lindsay.Barker, Nicolas (1978) Bibliotheca Lindesiana: the Lives and Collections of Alexander William, 25th Earl of Crawford and 8th Earl of Balcarres, and James Ludovic, 26th Earl of Crawford and 9th Earl of Balcarres. London: for Presentation to the Roxburghe Club, and published by Bernard Quaritch It was held that the seventh Earl's father, the sixth Earl, was the lawful successor to the earldom of Crawford (though he did not claim it); therefore, the sixth Earl of Balcarres was posthumously declared the 23rd Earl of Crawford, and his son, the seventh Earl of Balcarres, became the 24th Earl of Crawford. Thereafter, these two earldoms have remained united (but the Earldom of Lindsay is separate). The Earl of Crawford was mentioned in an episode of Keeping Up Appearances, when Hyacinth Bucket insisted that her milk be sourced from the \\"very attractive herd\\" on his estate. The subsidiary titles associated with the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres are: Lord Lindsay of Crawford (created 1398), Lord Lindsay and Balniel (1651) and Baron Wigan of Haigh Hall (1826). The former two subsidiary titles, as well as the two Earldoms, are in the Peerage of Scotland. The Barony is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. By virtue of the title of Baron Wigan of Haigh Hall, the Earls of Crawford and Balcarres sat in the House of Lords until the passage of the Peerage Act 1963. The present Earl sits in the House of Lords as Baron Balniel, a life peerage conferred on him in 1974 after he left the House of Commons and before the death of his father. The Earl of Crawford is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Lindsay. Family seat The family seat is Balcarres House in Colinsburgh, Fife. Until the 1940s they were also seated at Haigh Hall, Lancashire.

She fought mainly in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Pictou, Nova Scotia. Background Flower-class corvettes like Pictou serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Pictou was ordered on 22 January 1940 as part of the 1939‚Äì1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down by George T. Davie & Sons Ltd. at Lauzon on 12 July 1940 and launched on 5 October 1940. She was commissioned into the RCN on 29 April 1941 at Quebec City, Quebec. During her career, Pictou had several periods in the dockyard. The first took place after being sent back three times during convoy duties with mechanical problems. The repairs began at Halifax Dockyard and were completed at Liverpool, Nova Scotia. The second period in refit was due to a collision. Repairs began in August 1942 and were completed in September. Her third major period of overhaul began in December 1942 after developing serious mechanical issues while on convoy escort. She needed emergency repairs at Halifax before heading to Liverpool to commence a serious refit. The final period of yard work of Pictous career took place from January to 31 March 1944 at New York during which her fo'c'sle was extended. Service history After completing workups, Pictou was assigned to the Newfoundland Escort Force. She was one of the first two corvettes to become trans-Atlantic Ocean escorts. She spent the rest of 1941 as an ocean convoy escort. She was sent back to port three times with mechanical difficulties which led to her being sent for major repairs. In June 1942 she joined the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) as part of escort group C-4. On 5 August 1942, Pictou was rammed in fog by the Norwegian merchant SS Hindanger near St. John's. She suffered severe damage to her stern and was sent back to port for repairs. After workups she joined MOEF escort group C-2. In December 1942 she developed severe mechanical problems again and departed for repairs and then refit, not returning to service until May 1943. In May 1943 Pictou joined MOEF escort group C-3 and remained with them until departing for refit in January 1944. After workups in Bermuda she joined the Western Local Escort Force escort group W-5 in June 1944 and remained with them until the end of the war. Pictou was paid off from the RCN on 12 July 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. She was sold for mercantile conversion and in 1950 reappeared as the whalecatcher Olympic Chaser. She was renamed in 1956 as Otori Maru No. 7. In 1963 she was converted to a barge.

Modern standards, as outlined in the Geneva Conventions of later centuries, assume that captives will be held and cared for by their captors. One primary difference in the 18th century was that care and supplies for captives were expected to be provided by their own combatants or private resources. American prisoners The Jersey Prison Ship as moored at the Wallabout near Long Island, in 1782 Middle Dutch Church near Nassau and Cedar streets is where the enlisted men captured at the Battle of Long Island were imprisoned. The Sugar House also became a prison as the Redcoats captured more of Washington's soldiers during the retreat from New York. The site today is the location of One Chase Manhattan Plaza. (Image from about 1830.) King George III of Great Britain had declared American forces traitors in 1775, which denied them prisoner of war status. However, British strategy in the early conflict included pursuit of a negotiated settlement and so officials declined to try or hang them, the usual procedure for treason, to avoid unnecessarily risking any public sympathy the British might still enjoy.West, Charles E., \\"Horrors of the prison ships: Dr. West's description of the wallabout floating dungeons, how captive patriots fared.\\" Eagle Book Printing Department, 1895. Great Britain's neglect resulted in starvation and disease. Despite the lack of formal executions, neglect achieved the same results as hanging.Andros, Thomas. \\"The old Jersey captive: Or, A narrative of the captivity of Thomas Andros...on board the old Jersey prison ship at New York, 1781.

Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Fort Greene Park American prisoners of war tended to be accumulated at large sites, which the British were able to occupy for extended periods of time. New York City, Philadelphia in 1777, and Charleston, South Carolina, were all major cities used to detain American prisoners of war. Facilities there were limited. The occupying army could sometimes be larger than the total civilian population. The surgeon in charge of the New York hospitals housing American prisoners, Francis Mercier, was accused of killing them by poisoning and by assault, and he was ultimately executed for an unrelated murder. The loyalist stronghold of St. Augustine, Florida, was also used by the British to detain patriot prisoners. Notable prisoners included Brigadier General Griffith Rutherford of the Salisbury District Brigade. Prison ships The British solution to this problem was to use obsolete, captured, or damaged ships as prisons.Dring, Thomas and Greene, Albert. \\"Recollections of the Jersey Prison Ship\\" (American Experience Series, No 8). Applewood Books. November 1, 1986. Conditions were appalling, and many more Americans died of neglect in imprisonment than were killed in battle.Banks, James Lenox. \\"Prison ships in the Revolution: New facts in regard to their management.\\" 1903. While the Continental Army named a commissary to supply them, the task was almost impossible. Elias Boudinot, as one of the commissaries, was competing with other agents seeking to gather supplies for Washington's army at Valley Forge. Historian Edwin G. Burrows writes that \\"by the end of 1776, disease and starvation had killed at least half of those taken on Long Island and perhaps two-thirds of those captured at Fort Washington ‚Äì somewhere between 2,000 and 2,500 men in the space of two months.\\"Burrows, Edwin G. (2008). Forgotten Patriots: The Untold Story of American Prisoners During the Revolutionary War. Basic Books, New York. . p. 64. During the war, at least 16 hulks, including the infamous HMS Jersey, were placed by British authorities in the waters of Wallabout Bay off the shores of Brooklyn, New York as a place of incarceration for many thousands of American soldiers and sailors from about 1776 to about 1783. The prisoners of war were harassed and abused by guards who, with little success, offered release to those who agreed to serve in the British Navy.Taylor, George. \\"Martyrs To The Revolution In The British Prison-Ships In The Wallabout Bay.\\" (originally printed 1855) Kessinger Publishing, LLC.

Over 10,000 American prisoners of war died from neglect. Their corpses were often tossed overboard but sometimes were buried in shallow graves along the eroding shoreline. Many of the remains became exposed or were washed up and recovered by local residents over the years and later interred nearby in the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument at Fort Greene Park, once the scene of a portion of the Battle of Long Island. Survivors of the British Prison Ships include the poet Philip Freneau, Congressmen Robert Brown and George Mathews. The latter was involved in extensive advocacy efforts to improve the prison conditions on the ships. The American Revolution was an expensive war, and lack of money and resources led to the horrible conditions of British prison ships. The climate of the South worsened the difficult conditions. The primary cause of death in prison ships was diseases, as opposed to starvation. The British lacked decent and plentiful medical supplies for their own soldiers and had even less reserved for prisoners. Offshore in the North, conditions on prison ships caused many prisoners to enlist in the British military to save their lives. Most American POWs who survived incarceration were held until late 1779, when they were exchanged for British POWs. Prisoners who were extremely ill were often moved to hospital ships, but poor supplies precluded any difference between prison and hospital ships.Ranlet, Philip. Prison laborers and other prisoners of the British American prisoners were housed in other parts of the British Empire. Over 100 prisoners were employed as slave laborers in coal mines in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia - they later chose to join the British Navy to secure their freedom.Thomas, Evan. John Paul Jones: Sailor, Hero, Father of the American Navy. Simon and Schuster, pages 67,74 Other American prisoners were kept in England (Portsmouth, Plymouth, Liverpool, Deal, and Weymouth), Ireland, and Antigua. By late 1782 England and Ireland housed over 1,000 American prisoners, who, in 1783, were moved to France prior to their eventual release.Lindsay, William R. Treatment of American Prisoners During the Revolution. Emporia State Research Studies Kansas State Teachers College, Volume 23, Number 1 Continental Army prisoners of war from Cherry Valley were held by Loyalists at Fort Niagara near Niagara Falls, New York and at Fort Chambly near Montreal.Campbell, William W.: Annals of Tyron County; or, the Border Warfare of New-York during the Revolution, J. & J. Harper, New York (1831) pp. 110‚Äì11, 182, regarding prisoners (i.e., Lt. Col. William Stacy) held at Fort Niagara.McHenry, Chris: Rebel Prisoners at Quebec 1778-1783, Being a List of American Colonists were Held by the British during the Revolutionary War, Lawrenceburg, Indiana (1981). British, Hessian, and Loyalist prisoners=American laws of war During the American Revolution, George Washington and his Continental Army put the laws of war into practice regarding prisoners of war, unlike their British opponents. The Americans believed that all captives should be taken prisoner. On September 14, 1775, Washington, commander of the Northern Expeditionary Force, at camp in Cambridge, Massachusetts, wrote to Colonel Benedict Arnold: \\"Should any American soldier be so base and infamous as to injure any [prisoner]... I do most earnestly enjoin you to bring him to such severe and exemplary punishment as the enormity of the crime may require.\\"The torture report represents a heartbreaking decline in America's values After winning the Battle of Trenton on the morning of December 26, 1776, Washington found himself left with hundreds of Hessian troops who had surrendered to the Americans. Washington ordered his troops to take the prisoners in and \\"treat them with humanity,\\" which they did. \\"Let them have no reason to complain of our copying the brutal example of the British army in their treatment of our unfortunate brethren who have fallen into their hands,\\" Washington said. The official stance in the capturing of enemy troops was one of mercy. Grievances Edward G. Burrows remarks that although British and Hessian captives did \\"fare better on the whole than their American counterparts,\\" there were nevertheless \\"instances of outrageous cruelty\\" against them,Burrows, Edward G. (2008). Forgotten Patriots, p. 190. that \\"certain state governments had particularly bad records of prisoner abuse\\",Burrows, Edward G. (2008). Forgotten Patriots, p. 188. and that there were \\"numerous... complaints over the years from enemy prisoners about bad food, squalor and physical abuse.\\" Burrows, Edward G. (2008). Forgotten Patriots, p. 187. The treatment of prisoners of war varied from state to state. Provisions among the prisoners also varied but generally ranged from mediocre to bad in the last years of the war. British and German prisoners The British and the Germans shared similar and differing experiences as POWs. The Continental Congress' policies on the treatment of POWs remained the same for all enemy combatants and so the prisoner system was generally the same for the two nationalities. However, the British troops were valued more than the German mercenaries and so there are much more examples of British prisoner exchanges than German prisoner exchanges. Americans grew to hate the British more than the Germans, who were much less ill-behaved than the British. The British were more likely to cause disturbances, get into fights, and oppose the guards and the militia since they had become more invested in the defeat of the Americans than the Germans were.Dabney, William M. (1954). After Saratoga: The Story of the Convention Army. The University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque. p. 39-46. Loyalists Loyalists were the most hated POWs. The Continental Congress took the stance that since prisoners of war were enemy combatants, not criminals, the treatment of POWs differed from criminals. However, depending on the state, Loyalists were often treated more like criminals than POWs. Debate waged throughout the colonies whether to treat Loyalists as enemy soldiers or treasonous citizens.Metzger, Charles H. (1962). The Prisoner in the American Revolution. Loyola University Press, Chicago. . p. 31-63. Prison towns There were very few federal prisons as the Thirteen Colonies, and the Continental Congress were not in a position to create new ones to imprison British and German soldiers. Instead, Congress sent most British and Hessian prisoners to local American towns and ordered local officials to hold them under strict parole. The Continental Congress had the sole authority to decide where the prisoners went, and the local towns had little forewarning and no say in the matter. Prison towns found themselves with the burden of providing for hundreds or thousands of prisoners at a time. In towns that could not afford to feed prisoners, the prisoners were put to work to feed themselves. British and German prisoners cultivated gardens and worked for farms, craftsmen, and other forms of unskilled labor. Local communities attempted to make prison towns as profitable as possible and often helped prisoners find jobs or sent them to other towns and states for work. The more useful the prisoners of war were, the less of an economic burden they were on the town. A town unable to erect barracks for the prisoners was forced to house them in community churches and even citizens' homes. The Continental Congress' forcing Americans to quarter prisoners was a major source of contention among the people. Even when British and Hessian prisoners of war were not being held in individual houses, they were still in public view, which caused general fear, resentment, and anger. Prisoners were generally not confined to their quarters and could remain in public for the duration of the day. Security proved to be a problem for prison towns. With no official police force and the military being preoccupied with war, local militias and volunteers generally guarded the prisoners of war. Protests in prison towns were common, and people who denied prisoners entry were punished for disobeying the Continental Congress in the form of fines, jail time, and even property expropriation. The reception prisoners received varied from place to place. Overall, the prisoners staying in Boston were in relative peace. The prisoners remarked that the general population of Boston was civil and tolerant of the prisoners. In Virginia and other southern states, wealthy planters and plantation owners were happy to have prisoners in Albemarle County because they could count on an even greater abundance of free or cheap labor. In contrast, the lower class in the South was generally much less tolerant to sharing residence with abundant prisoner populations. In Maryland, the state militia directly and aggressively challenged the Continental Army when it attempted to escort the prisoners of war into the state. The South had a collective fear of insurrection that emerged because of the slave population. Convention Army On October 17, 1777, nearly 6,000 British and Hessian soldiers of the Convention Army surrendered to the Americans. That put the Continental Congress in the position of holding a massive number of prisoners of war on American soil, something that not happened much until then. It was already having trouble providing for the Continental Army, and after Saratoga, it also had to provide for enemy combatants. Surrender of General Burgoyne by John Trumbull, 1822; this painting hangs in the United States Capitol Rotunda A 1789 etching depicting the encampment of the Convention Army at Charlottesville, Virginia Background After British, German, and Canadian troops were defeated, General Burgoyne and General Gates were unable to agree in regard to the 5,900 prisoners. In the Convention of Saratoga, the terms were that the troops were going to be sent back to Europe and would never wage war with North America again. Congress saw that condition as an abysmal treaty for one of their greatest victories in the American Revolution and delayed its ratification repeatedly. General Burgoyne grew frustrated with Congress and openly condemned its actions. Congress used Burgoyne's words as evidence that he was planning to renounce the convention and suspended it until Great Britain recognized American independence.Dabney, William M. (1954). After Saratoga, p. 7-26. The Americans ended up holding the Convention Army for the duration of the war. Marches \\"After spending the next year in camps near Cambridge and Rutland, Massachusetts, they were sent by Congress on an overland odyssey that, by the end of the war, took them down to Virginia, then up to Maryland, into Pennsylvania again, and finally back to Rutland. Almost every step of the way they contended with meagre rations, shortages of fuel, inadequate accommodations, and physical violence.\\"Burrows, Edward G. (2008). Forgotten Patriots, p. 188. Over the course of the revolution, the Convention Army was marched across the colonies. First, it was marched to Massachusetts and remained there for a year, and in 1778, it was moved to Virginia, where it remained for two years. In 1780, it was moved north and gradually dispersed to different states, cities, and towns for the rest of the war. The marches themselves were brutal on the soldiers, but their lives generally improved once they got to their destinations. The main reasons for the marches across America were security and finance. Once resources became scarce in Massachusetts, Congress ordered the army to be moved South. The war effort was very different in the North from the South. In 1780, it had become difficult to provide British and German prisoners of war and their guards with food in the South, where their presence had become a security risk. The British had started their official campaigns in the South, which brought the risk of insurrections. The Convention Army was thus ordered to march back North and was dispersed.Dabney, William M. (1954). After Saratoga, p. 27-78. Freedom There were three ways for a prisoner of war to achieve freedom after being captured: desertion, exchange, or parole. Most of the time, a small militia-hired guard was tasked to supervise the imprisonment of captured British and German soldiers. Their ability to watch over their prisoners efficiently was constantly tested. The Convention Army initially took their POW status gracefully but only because they were under the assumption that they would be sent home within a year. When it became clear that the Americans had no intention of allowing the British to return to Great Britain until the war ended, tensions between the soldiers and the guard escalated and desertions rose rapidly. Propaganda was used by Americans and by high-ranking captured British officials to dissuade troops from deserting, but it largely failed.Dabney, William M. (1954). After Saratoga, p. 39-40. Many of the prisoners who escaped captivity took American women with them and reared families. A large number of Hessians remained in the US after the war was over because they married American women.Daniel Krebs (1974). A Generous and Merciful Enemy: Life for German Prisoners of War during the American Revolution. University of Oklahoma Press: Norman . . Between the time of the Siege of Yorktown (1781) and the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1783), many of the convention troops, by then mostly Germans, escaped and took up permanent residence in the United States. The American government did not have the means to prevent this.Dabney, William M. (1954). After Saratoga, p.77. The two other official forms of reaching freedom (parole and exchange) was common among high-ranking officers. Parole specifically dealt with individual prisoners of war and so the process of being removed from imprisonment or house arrest and placed on parole was a very simple and speedy process. Most British and German prisoners of war thus sought after parole, but the breaking of parole was common, as many used it just to make desertion easier. Some British and Hessian prisoners of war were paroled to American farmers. Their labor made up for shortages caused by the number of men serving in the Continental Army. Exchange, however, was a very complex and slow process because it involved negotiation and diplomacy between a new and inexperienced nation and a state that absolutely refused to recognize American independence. A major hindrance to exchange was the reluctance of the British to concede non-rebel status to its adversaries. The British perception of the Americans being rebels prevented exchange. A degree of mutual acceptance between Congress and the States of the principle of exchange and procedure in its implementing must have been attained by the end of March 1777. Exchange was handled primarily by Congress, instead of state powers.Metzger, Charles H. (1962). The Prisoner in the American Revolution, p. 191-232. While state and local government had considerable power over parole, the federal government had power of negotiating exchanges. Reaction and impact The capture of thousands of British prisoners of war in the hands of the Americans had the effect of further dissuading British officials from hanging colonial prisoners, despite the abandoned hopes of a settlement by this stage, as they feared reprisals on prisoners being held by the Americans.West, Charles E. Horrors of the Prison Ships. After the Convention Army was captured, the rate of prisoner exchanges increased dramatically as a result. During the first years of the revolution, the Continental Congress tried to give prisoners of war the same amount of provisions as the soldiers guarding them. However, after the capture of the Convention Army resources turned scarce and the federal government had to rely on state governments to provide for prisoners of war. From 1777 to 1778, General Clinton was providing food for the Convention Army, but he eventually decided to end his assistance and to place the full economic burden of providing for the prisoners on the US government. In order to compensate for its lack of resources that Congress could give to the British and German prisoners, they were moved from state to state. The marches were largely a result of diminishing provisions.Dabney, William M. (1954). After Saratoga, p. 27-78. Aside from the official marching of the Convention Army, captured prisoners were paraded through cities after military victories as a form of celebration for the Americans and humiliation for their enemies. The parades were done to boost morale among Americans. The Revolutionary War had devastating effects on communities and to see clear examples of US progress and victory helped gain support for the war effort.Dabney, William M. (1954).

The phenomenon is temperature-dependent. There is disagreement about the parameters required to produce the effect and about its theoretical basis. The Mpemba effect is named after Tanzanian schoolboy Erasto Bartholomeo Mpemba (born 1950) who discovered it in 1963. There were preceding ancient accounts of similar phenomena, but these lacked sufficient detail to attempt verification.  Definition  The phenomenon, when taken to mean \\"hot water freezes faster than cold\\", is difficult to reproduce or confirm because this statement is ill-defined. Monwhea Jeng proposes as a more precise wording: > There exists a set of initial parameters, and a pair of temperatures, such > that given two bodies of water identical in these parameters, and differing > only in initial uniform temperatures, the hot one will freeze sooner. However, even with this definition it is not clear whether \\"freezing\\" refers to the point at which water forms a visible surface layer of ice; the point at which the entire volume of water becomes a solid block of ice; or when the water reaches . A quantity of water can be at and not be ice; after enough heat has been removed to reach more heat must be removed before the water changes to solid state (ice), so water can be liquid or solid at . With the above definition there are simple ways in which the effect might be observed. For example, if the hotter temperature melts the frost on a cooling surface and thus increases the thermal conductivity between the cooling surface and the water container. On the other hand, there may be many circumstances in which the effect is not observed.  Observations = Historical context  Various effects of heat on the freezing of water were described by ancient scientists such as Aristotle: \\"The fact that the water has previously been warmed contributes to its freezing quickly: for so it cools sooner. Hence many people, when they want to cool water quickly, begin by putting it in the sun. So the inhabitants of Pontus when they encamp on the ice to fish (they cut a hole in the ice and then fish) pour warm water round their reeds that it may freeze the quicker, for they use the ice like lead to fix the reeds.\\" Aristotle's explanation involved antiperistasis, \\"the supposed increase in the intensity of a quality as a result of being surrounded by its contrary quality.\\" Early modern scientists such as Francis Bacon noted that, \\"slightly tepid water freezes more easily than that which is utterly cold.\\"Bacon, Francis; Novum Organum, Lib. II, L In the original Latin, \\"aqua parum tepida facilius conglacietur quam omnino frigida.\\" Ren√© Descartes wrote in his Discourse on the Method, \\"One can see by experience that water that has been kept on a fire for a long time freezes faster than other, the reason being that those of its particles that are least able to stop bending evaporate while the water is being heated.\\"Descartes, Ren√©; Les M√©t√©ores This relates to Descartes' vortex theory. The Scottish scientist Joseph Black investigated a special case of this phenomenon comparing previously-boiled with unboiled water; the previously-boiled water froze more quickly. Evaporation was controlled for. He discussed the influence of stirring on the results of the experiment, noting that stirring the unboiled water led to it freezing at the same time as the previously-boiled water, and also noted that stirring the very-cold unboiled water led to immediate freezing. Joseph Black then discussed Fahrenheit's description of supercooling of water (although the term supercooling had not then been coined), arguing, in modern terms, that the previously-boiled water could not be as readily supercooled.  Mpemba's observation  The effect is named after Tanzanian Erasto Mpemba. He described it in 1963 in Form 3 of Magamba Secondary School, Tanganyika, when freezing ice cream mix that was hot in cookery classes and noticing that it froze before the cold mix. He later became a student at Mkwawa Secondary (formerly High) School in Iringa. The headmaster invited Dr. Denis Osborne from the University College in Dar es Salaam to give a lecture on physics. After the lecture, Mpemba asked him the question, \\"If you take two similar containers with equal volumes of water, one at and the other at , and put them into a freezer, the one that started at freezes first. Why?\\", only to be ridiculed by his classmates and teacher. After initial consternation, Osborne experimented on the issue back at his workplace and confirmed Mpemba's finding. They published the results together in 1969, while Mpemba was studying at the College of African Wildlife Management. republished as Mpemba and Osborne describe placing samples of water in beakers in the ice box of a domestic refrigerator on a sheet of polystyrene foam. They showed the time for freezing to start was longest with an initial temperature of and that it was much less at around . They ruled out loss of liquid volume by evaporation as a significant factor and the effect of dissolved air. In their setup most heat loss was found to be from the liquid surface.  Modern experimental work  David Auerbach describes an effect that he observed in samples in glass beakers placed into a liquid cooling bath. In all cases the water supercooled, reaching a temperature of typically before spontaneously freezing. Considerable random variation was observed in the time required for spontaneous freezing to start and in some cases this resulted in the water which started off hotter (partially) freezing first. In 2016, Burridge and Linden defined the criterion as the time to reach , carried out experiments and reviewed published work to date. They noted that the large difference originally claimed had not been replicated, and that studies showing a small effect could be influenced by variations in the positioning of thermometers. They say, \\"We conclude, somewhat sadly, that there is no evidence to support meaningful observations of the Mpemba effect\\". In controlled experiments the effect can entirely be explained by undercooling and the time of freezing was determined by what container was used. Experimental results confirming the Mpemba effect have been critized for being flawed, not accounting for dissolved solids and gasses and other confounding factors. A reviewer for Physics World writes, \\"Even if the Mpemba effect is real ‚Äî if hot water can sometimes freeze more quickly than cold ‚Äî it is not clear whether the explanation would be trivial or illuminating.\\" He pointed out that investigations of the phenomenon need to control a large number of initial parameters (including type and initial temperature of the water, dissolved gas and other impurities, and size, shape and material of the container, and temperature of the refrigerator) and need to settle on a particular method of establishing the time of freezing, all of which might affect the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect. The required vast multidimensional array of experiments might explain why the effect is not yet understood.Ball, Philip (April 2006). Does hot water freeze first?. Physics World, pp. 19‚Äì26. New Scientist recommends starting the experiment with containers at to maximize the effect.How to Fossilize Your Hamster: And Other Amazing Experiments for the Armchair Scientist, In a related study, it was found that freezer temperature also affects the probability of observing the Mpemba phenomenon as well as container temperature. Theoretical explanations While the actual occurrence of the Mbempa effect is a matter of controversy , several theoretical explanations could explain its occurrence. In 2017, two research groups independently and simultaneously found a theoretical Mpemba effect and also predicted a new \\"inverse\\" Mpemba effect in which heating a cooled, far- from-equilibrium system takes less time than another system that is initially closer to equilibrium. Lu and Raz yield a general criterion based on Markovian statistical mechanics, predicting the appearance of the inverse Mpemba effect in the Ising model and diffusion dynamics. Lasanta and co-workers predict also the direct and inverse Mpemba effects for a granular gas in a far-from- equilibrium initial state. In this last work, it is suggested that a very generic mechanism leading to both Mpemba effects is due to a particle velocity distribution function that significantly deviates from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. James Brownridge, a radiation safety officer at the State University of New York, has said that he believes that supercooling is involved. Several molecular dynamics simulations have also supported that changes in hydrogen bonding during supercooling takes a major role in the process. Tao and co-workers proposed yet another possible explanation in 2016. On the basis of results from vibrational spectroscopy and modeling with density functional theory-optimized water clusters, they suggest that the reason might lie in the vast diversity and peculiar occurrence of different hydrogen bonds. Their key argument is that the number of strong hydrogen bonds increases as temperature is elevated. The existence of the small strongly- bonded clusters facilitates in turn the nucleation of hexagonal ice when warm water is rapidly cooled down.  Suggested explanations  The following explanations have been proposed: * Evaporation: The evaporation of the warmer water reduces the mass of the water to be frozen. Evaporation is endothermic, meaning that the water mass is cooled by vapor carrying away the heat, but this alone probably does not account for the entirety of the effect. * Convection: Accelerating heat transfers. Reduction of water density below tends to suppress the convection currents that cool the lower part of the liquid mass; the lower density of hot water would reduce this effect, perhaps sustaining the more rapid initial cooling. Higher convection in the warmer water may also spread ice crystals around faster.CITV Prove It! Series 1 Programme 13 * Frost: Has insulating effects. The lower temperature water will tend to freeze from the top, reducing further heat loss by radiation and air convection, while the warmer water will tend to freeze from the bottom and sides because of water convection. This is disputed as there are experiments that account for this factor. * Solutes: The effects of calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate among others. * Thermal conductivity: The container of hotter liquid may melt through a layer of frost that is acting as an insulator under the container (frost is an insulator, as mentioned above), allowing the container to come into direct contact with a much colder lower layer that the frost formed on (ice, refrigeration coils, etc.) The container now rests on a much colder surface (or one better at removing heat, such as refrigeration coils) than the originally colder water, and so cools far faster from this point on. *Dissolved gases: Cold water can contain more dissolved gases than hot water, which may somehow change the properties of the water with respect to convection currents, a proposition that has some experimental support but no theoretical explanation. * Hydrogen bonding: In warm water, hydrogen bonding is weaker. * Crystallization: Another explanation suggests that the relatively higher population of water hexamer states in warm water might be responsible for the faster crystallization. * Distribution function: Strong deviations from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution results in potential Mpemba effect showing up in gases.  Similar effects  Other phenomena in which large effects may be achieved faster than small effects are: * Latent heat: Turning ice to water takes the same amount of energy as heating water from to ; * Leidenfrost effect: Lower temperature boilers can sometimes vaporize water faster than higher temperature boilers.

The poem is typical of Paterson, offering a romantic view of rural life, and is one of his best-known works. The poem is written in eight stanzas of four lines, lines one and three in a two-feet anapaest with a feminine internal rhyme, and lines two and four in trochaic octameter with masculine rhymes: AA‚ÄìB‚ÄìCC‚ÄìB. History The poem is written from the point of view of a city-dweller who once met the title character, a shearer and drover, and now envies the imagined pleasures of Clancy's lifestyle, which he compares favourably to life in \\"the dusty, dirty city\\" and \\"the round eternal of the cashbook and the journal\\". And the bush hath friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet him In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars, And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended, And at night the wond'rous glory of the everlasting stars. The poem is possibly based on Paterson's own experience. The introduction to Banjo Paterson's Images of Australia by Douglas Baglin quotes Paterson as saying that he was working as a lawyer when someone asked him to send a letter to a man named Thomas Gerald Clancy, asking for a payment that had not been received. Paterson sent the letter to \\"The Overflow\\", a sheep station 100 kilometres south-west of Nyngan, and received a reply that read: Clancy's gone to Queensland droving, and we don't know where he are. The letter looked as though it had been written with a thumbnail dipped in tar and it is from this that Banjo Paterson found the inspiration for the poem, along with the meter. The poem was well-received and raised much curiosity about the identity of \\"The Banjo\\". Soon after its publication, Rolf Boldrewood, author of Robbery Under Arms (1882), wrote in his literary column for The Australasian that \\"Clancy of the Overflow\\" was \\"the best bush ballad since Gordon\\".The Australasian, 8 January 1890. Clancy makes a cameo appearance in another popular Banjo Paterson poem, \\"The Man from Snowy River\\", which was first published the following year. There are claims that Clancy was based on a man called Thomas Michael MacNamara, who described the ride with the \\"Man from Snowy River\\" (his brother in law Jim Troy) in an article in The Courier-Mail in 1938 The Courier-Mail, Brisbane, 21 December 1938, \\"Stockman of whom Poet Sang\\" In 1897, Thomas Gerald Clancy wrote a poem in reply to \\"Clancy of the Overflow\\", entitled \\"Clancy's Reply\\", which paints a far less romantic picture of the life of a drover.\\"Clancy's Reply\\" by Thomas Gerald Clancy There had also been a parody in 1892, \\"The Overflow of Clancy\\". In other media Clancy was portrayed by Jack Thompson in the movie The Man from Snowy River, and Clancy is mentioned in the musical theatre production The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular ‚Äì during the recitation of the poem, Clancy is mentioned by Steve Bisley in his role of Banjo Paterson while the poem is being re-enacted in the show. Contemporary recordings of the poem include Jack Thompson's recitation on Jack Thompson, The Bush Poems of A.B.

(Banjo) Paterson, 2008 , Fine Poets, accessed 12 May 2011 The poem \\"Clancy of the Overflow\\" has also been set to music and recorded several times, including: * John Cameron's recording of Albert Arlen's setting, with an orchestra conducted by George S. English (1955); * Peter Dawson's recording of the same setting, with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Charles Mackerras (4 May 1955); * In 1980 the Australian folk group Wallis and Matilda recorded a popular song version of the poem, eventually peaking at 30 on the ARIA charts; * John Schumann of Redgum recorded it on his 1993 album True Believers; * Tenor Australis included a musical arrangement of the poem on their 1999 album Under an Australian Sky; * Comedian Adam Hills performed it on his ABC show Adam Hills Tonight in July 2013 as a mashup with Ali McGregor singing The Church hit \\"Under the Milky Way\\". * Melbourne-based production company Yut Art produced a contemporary version in 2013. Proposed film In 2004, there were plans to make a movie of \\"Clancy of the Overflow\\", a sequel to the 1982 film The Man from Snowy River, but this fell through due to financial reasons. The director was to have been Simon Wincer, who was a co- producer for The Man from Snowy River.\\"Simon heads for the Overflow\\" by Garry Maddox, The Sydney Morning Herald (1 April 2004) Bruce Rowland (who composed the music for both the 1982 film The Man from Snowy River and its 1988 sequel film The Man from Snowy River II, as well as composing music for The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular, was to compose the music for the film.

She was launched in Glasgow, in December 1917, and scuttled in July 1944 off the Normandy beaches as part of the Arromanches Breakwater. History=Pre World War II Dragon and the tanker War Angler at Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, March 1918 One of the fastest-built ships of the time, Dragon (pennant number D46)At this time, the Royal Navy used the letter D for major warships, not destroyers was laid down on 24 January 1917 in Glasgow. She was launched on 29 December that year. However, it was not until 10 August 1918 she was finally commissioned at Harwich Dockyard by the Royal Navy as HMS Dragon, commanded by Capt. A. H. Allington. Armed with six 6-inch guns, the light cruiser was commissioned late during World War I and a Daily Mirror article of 1934 credits Maurice Green a South African of firing the last shot of the war at sea when HMS Dragon engaged German seaplanes off Heligoland Bight on 9 November 1918. She carried the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) to Canada in August 1919 to begin a royal tour. She then took part in the Russian Civil War as part of a task force aiding independent Latvia and Estonia against the Bolsheviks and German Freikorps forces in October and November 1919, as part of the British intervention in the Baltic. On 17 October 1919 Dragon was hit by three shells fired from a shore battery while taking part in operations against German forces attacking Riga, suffering nine killed and five wounded. Crew members from Dragon pose for a photo at the stern of the ship during a harbour visit in the 1920s. From 1920, she was part of the First Light Cruiser Squadron in the Atlantic Fleet. She recommissioned 8 May 1923 and 2 February 1926 at Chatham. In the interbellum, in 1924, she was part of the First Cruiser Squadron, Atlantic. During 1924, she was attached to a task force with , , , (which would later replace Dragon in the Polish Navy) and for a variety of tasks around the world. Dragon was stationed in Zanzibar, Ceylon, New Zealand, Fiji, Canada, and Jamaica, and took part in visits to the United States, Dutch Antilles, and Australia. On 20 December 1928, she was withdrawn from service and underwent a major refurbishment in Great Britain. Among other changes, the hangar for her seaplane was dismantled. 15 November 1929, she was given to Commander P. W. Nelles, RCN. On 22 January 1930, the refit was completed and Dragon entered commission once more, and after undergoing trials at Chatham acted as tender to Pembroke. She was commissioned a number of times during the 1930s on 30 May 1933 No√´l Coward the well-known playwright, composer, director, actor and singer who had arrived at Bermuda on 28 May on SS Roma found his way on board HMS Dragon commanded by Captain Philip Louis Vian whose first words were on his discovery were \\"What the hell are you doing on board this ship?\\" but after having some gin in the Captain‚Äôs cabin Coward was allowed to stay for a cruise on the ship ending on the Pacific side of the Panama canal, HMS Dragon headed out into the Pacific for the China Station. In 1935 Dragon was attached again to the America and West Indies station. In 1934, she was involved in a collision with a ship in the harbour of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, which resulted in an Admiralty action against her captain at the time, Frederic Wake-Walker. The Canadian courts found him liable for the collision. That finding of liability was upheld on appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for the British Empire and Commonwealth. In late October 1936 HMS Dragon attempted several times to tow the large Spanish cruise liner Cristobal Colon which had struck a reef north of Bermuda, these recovery attempts were not successful and the remains of Cristobal Colon still lie at the reef. She recommissioned with a reserve crew 16 July 1937, serving as a tender to , and in 1938-9 she formed part of the Reserve Fleet based at The Nore. Wartime career HMS Dragon in the 1920s During World War II, the ship was initially attached to the 7th Cruiser Squadron of the Northern Patrol,in the Shetland area. In November 1939, she took part in pursuit of the . In February 1940, HMS Dragon crossed the Mediterranean and returned to the Atlantic. On 16 September 1940 she scored her first victory after capturing the French steamer Touareg. On 23 September of the same year she reached the area of the port of Dakar, where she took part in Operation Menace against the French fleet stationed there. Together with and , she sank the Vichy France submarine and took part in shelling the port. HMS Dragon moved to Freetown, from where she operated against the in December. Until November 1941 Dragon served as an escort ship of various convoys in the Atlantic, after which she was moved to Asia. Following commencement of hostilities with Japan in December, she served with the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command forces, escorting convoys to Singapore, HMS Dragon was the last warship to leave Singapore before it surrendered.file:///C:/Users/alter/AppData/Local/Temp/142952-379876-1-SM.pdf On 20 January 1942, she was attached to the Western task force operating in the Java Sea, which included HMAS Hobart, HMS Danae, HMS Tenedos and HMS Scout. After the fall of Java, she joined and the Dutch cruiser , and operated from Ceylon. In May she was moved to Madagascar. The following month, most of the crew of the ship was landed and moved to other units, while Dragon started her voyage back to Britain for refurbishment. Since the rump crew could not operate the ship independently, she had to be attached to various convoys and it took almost half a year before she finally reached Liverpool via Cape Town, Chatham and Durban. Transferred to the Polish Navy On 15 January 1943 she was handed over to the Polish Navy, renamed ORP Dragon and manned by a Polish crew. While the name of the ship remained the same it took on a new meaning. Dragon in Polish is smok, while \\"Dragon\\" in Polish means Dragoon (a mounted infantry soldier) although the latter still comes in a roundabout way from dragon. Modernized in the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead, she was refitted with new electric plant and installation, radar and armament. The refurbishment was finished on 23 August 1943 and the ship was moved to Scapa Flow. From there she operated as part of various convoy escorts. On 20 February 1944 she was joined by and and escorted the JW.57 convoy part way to Murmansk. Upon her return she was attached to various larger ships for training of sea to land operations before the Battle of Normandy. Finally on 2 June she was attached to a flotilla composed of , , , , , Danae and 24 smaller vessels and headed for Normandy. The ship saw action at the Normandy Landings as part of Operation Neptune, shelling German shore batteries at Colleville- sur-Orne and at Trouville (Sword Beach) from a distance of four kilometres. A near miss by a German shore battery gun wounded three sailors. She withdrew under cover of Ramillies and , whose fire destroyed the battery. In the evening of D-Day she moved to Juno Beach sector, to support the advancing Allied troops. The following day the ship shelled German positions in and around the town of Caen. However, on 8 June a communication systems failure prevented the ship from further bombardment and it was not until late at night that she again opened fire against the German 21st Panzer Division near Varaville. The following day she took part in an artillery duel with a shore battery at Houlgate, after which she returned to Portsmouth for refuelling and supplies. Between 12 June and 17 June she again shelled German positions near Caen, Gouneville, L√©bisey and Varaville. During that time she also evaded a torpedo attack by an unknown submarine. On 18 June she was bound for Portsmouth escorting which had been struck by a mine. Damage and scuttling On 7 July 1944 Dragon returned to the area off Caen, where she was to take part in the final artillery preparations for capturing the city after a month-long siege. At 5:40 am the following day, while waiting for the order to open fire at , the Dragon was hit by a German Neger manned torpedo, thought to be piloted by Walther Gerhold, and 26 men were lost. A book published in London by William Kimber in 1955 provides a different pilot responsible for the attack. According to \\"K-Men: The Story of the German Frogmen and Midget Submarines\\" (author C.D. Bekker, with a preface by Hellmuth Heye, formerly Admiral of the K-Force), the pilot was Midshipman Potthast. Potthast's first person account of the attack on Dragon is described. On 13 June, a week after the Normandy landings, 40 Neger human torpedoes and their personnel, many new recruits, began a journey from Italy to Normandy. They travelled to Paris by train and then road to Normandy. Allied fighter bomber activity made it difficult to travel during daylight hours and the flotilla leader, Lieutenant Johann-Otto Krieg, was seriously wounded in one attack. Potthast, as the next most experienced pilot, took command and they finally met with Captain Friedrich B√∂hme, a former destroyer commander, who had been sent ahead to the Bay of the Seine to make facilities for the K-flotilla's arrival. According to Potthast's report, 20 Negers set sail in the early hours of 7 July. (Potthast had aborted a mission two nights previously due to mechanical problems.) At 03:00 a line of small patrol vessels passed by Potthast but \\"I had no intention of wasting my torpedo on them.\\" Some 45 minutes later he let merchant ships pass as \\"I was determined to bag a warship\\". Around 04:00 he sighted a , but she turned away when some 500 yards from him so he was forced to wait. In the moonlight he then saw several warships in quarter-line formation crossing his path and he steered to attack the rear ship, which seemed larger than the others. At a distance of 300 yards Potthast pulled the torpedo firing lever and he actioned a post-attack escape. The explosion, so close by, almost \\"hurled his neger out of the water\\". \\"A sheet of flame shot upwards from the stricken ship. Almost at once I was enveloped in thick smoke and I lost all sense of direction. When the smoke cleared I saw that the warship's stern had been blown away.\\" Other vessels counterattacked, firing wildly as they could not see Potthast, but he managed to evade them. Later, two frigates passed close by Potthast but they did not spot him. After more than six hours in his cramped cockpit Potthast was severely fatigued. He eventually dozed and in the morning light a corvette attacked with gunfire from around 100 yards off. Potthast managed to get out of the neger as the gunfire disabled the craft. With blood pouring from an arm wound he collapsed, but the corvette crew rescued him with a boathook and rope looped under his arms. He was taken to the sick-bay and given tea and biscuits. Later flown to an English hospital, Potthast was interrogated by military intelligence and although confronted with maps and details of K-flotilla deployments he refused to confirm or deny anything. \\"After six weeks they gave up, then suddenly told him that he had himself been responsible for the sinking of the 5,000-ton cruiser Dragon. ...All this cheered up the prisoner, who felt that his arduous training had not been wasted after all,\\" wrote Bekker. The explosion caused a fire in the 3rd magazine, which had to be filled with water, and the 3rd engine was also hit. The ship started to sink on her port side and the angle of list reached 9¬∞, but the situation was stabilized by the captain, who ordered all the turrets to train their barrels to starboard. Although an additional 11 sailors died of wounds, the situation was stabilized and the ship was moved to shallows, where she was to await the ebb tide. After the water was pumped out of the flooded engine room, it was discovered that the hull was pierced across two sections and the hole was approximately by . Although still afloat and repairable, it was decided that the ship be abandoned. On 10 July, aided Dragon by transporting 17 of her officers and 320 of her enlisted men from Normandy to England. Until 15 July the remaining rump crew dismantled the armament. An additional two bodies were found in the ship, and the dead were buried at sea. On 16 July she was decommissioned and then towed to Mulberry \\"B\\", where on 20 July she was scuttled to form part of the artificial breakwater near Courseulles. On 4 October 1944, she was replaced in Polish service with ORP Conrad, formerly HMS Dragon sister ship .

The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, driving two shafts, which produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by 20 Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers and six cylindrical boilers. The ship carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for at a speed of . The ship's complement was 789 officers and enlisted men.Parkes, p. 442 Armament Her main armament consisted of six BL Mark X guns in single turrets. The guns were distributed in two centerline turrets (one each fore and one aft) and four turrets disposed in the corners about the funnels. Her secondary armament of ten BL 6-inch Mk XI guns was arranged in single casemates. They were mounted amidships on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather. Twenty Vickers quick-firing (QF) three-pounders were fitted, six on turret roofs and fourteen in the superstructure. The ship also mounted three submerged torpedo tubes.Parkes, pp. 442‚Äì43  History  Duke of Edinburgh was ordered under the 1902/1903 naval construction programme as the lead ship of her class.

When the Royal Navy's cruiser squadrons were reorganized in 1909, Duke of Edinburgh rejoined the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet.Parkes, p. 444 On 13 August 1910 Duke of Edinburgh ran aground on Atherfield Ledge, Isle of Wight. She was successfully refloated, but in the resulting Court-martial to investigate the incident, the ship's Captain and Navigating Officer were severely reprimanded and the latter dismissed from the ship. She helped to rescue the survivors of the SS Delhi which ran aground off the coast of Morocco in December 1911. From 1913 to 1914 she served with the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. When the British began to prepare for war in July 1914, the ship was refitting at Malta. Her refit was cut short and she joined the rest of her squadron in the southern approaches to the Adriatic.Corbett, I, pp. 33, 35 She was involved in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser Goeben and light cruiser Breslau at the outbreak of World War I, but was ordered not to engage them.Gardiner and Gray, p. 13 On 10 August Duke of Edinburgh and her sister ship were ordered to the Red Sea to protect troop convoys arriving from India.

The ship then landed a demolition party, which blew the fort up on 10 November; she then rejoined the convoy.Corbett, I, pp. 377‚Äì79 Duke of Edinburgh rejoined the 1st Cruiser Squadron, which had been transferred to the Grand Fleet in the meantime, in December 1914. In March 1916 the ship had her main deck 6-inch guns removed and the openings plated over. Six of the guns were remounted on the upper deck, three on each side, between the wing turrets, protected by gun shields. At the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, the 1st Cruiser Squadron was in front of the Grand Fleet, on the right side. At 5:47 p.m.The times used in this article are in UTC, which is one hour behind CET, which is often used in German works. The two leading ships of the squadron, the flagship, , and , spotted the German II Scouting Group and opened fire. Their shells felt short and the two ships turned to port in pursuit, cutting in front of the battlecruiser , which was forced to turn away to avoid a collision. Duke of Edinburgh could not follow the first two ships and turned to port (northeast).Marder, pp. 97‚Äì98 The ship spotted the disabled German light cruiser at 6:08 and fired twenty rounds at her. By about 6:30 she had steamed to a position off the starboard bow of , the leading ship of the 2nd Battle Squadron, where her funnel smoke obscured the German ships from the foremost dreadnoughts of the 2nd Battle Squadron.Campbell, pp. 122, 150, 152 A torpedo attack by German destroyers on Admiral Beatty's battlecruisers, failed, but forced Duke of Edinburgh to evade one torpedo at 6:47. The ship reported a submarine sighting at 7:01, although no German submarines were operating in the area. She fired at another false submarine contact between 7:45 and 8:15.Campbell, pp. 161, 164, 250 After the battle, Duke of Edinburgh was attached to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron and remained at sea until 2 June, searching for disabled ships. She arrived in Scapa Flow on the afternoon of 3 June.Newbolt, IV, p. 1 On the evening of 18 August 1916, the Grand Fleet, including Duke of Edinburgh, put to sea in response to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet, minus the II Battle Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The Germans planned to bombard the port of Sunderland on 19 August, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Germans broke off their planned attack to pursue a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans then set course for home. After Jutland the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, now including Duke of Edinburgh, was ordered to reinforce the patrols north of the Shetland Islands against German blockade runners and commerce raiders.Newbolt, IV, pp. 36, 192 The ship's foremast was converted to a tripod to support the weight of a fire- control director in May 1917, but when the director was actually fitted is not known. Two more 6-inch guns were added in embrasures on the forecastle deck during that same refit. She was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in August 1917 for convoy escort duties,Newbolt, V, p. 135 where she remained for the duration of the war. Upon her return, Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the Humber, before she was sold for scrap on 12 April 1920 and broken up at Blyth in Northumberland.

Launched in 1852, she was symptomatic of an era of rapid technological change in the navy, being powered both by sail and steam. An early steam-powered ship, she was still fitted with towering masts and trim square-set yards, and was the flagship of Sir Charles Napier. Design and construction launch that year. The ship later was renamed HMS Duke of Wellington. First christened HMS Windsor Castle, she was the first of a class of four that represented the ultimate development of the wooden three-decker ship of the line which had been the mainstay capital ship in naval warfare for 200 years. She was originally ordered in 1841 to a design of Sir William Symonds, the Surveyor of the Navy, but was not laid down until May 1849 at Pembroke Dock by which time Symonds had resigned and the design had been modified by the Assistant Surveyor John Edye. At this stage the ship was still intended as a sailing vessel. Although the Royal Navy had been using steam power in smaller ships for three decades, it had not been adopted for ships of the line, partly because the enormous paddle-boxes required would have meant a severe reduction in the number of guns carried. This problem was solved by the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s. Under a crash programme announced in December 1851 to provide the navy with a steam-driven battlefleet, the design was further modified by the new Surveyor, Captain Baldwin Walker. The ship was cut apart in two places on the stocks in January 1852, lengthened by 30 feet (9.1 m) overall and given screw propulsion. She received the 780 hp engines designed and built by Robert Napier and Sons for the iron frigate Simoon, which had surrendered them on conversion to a troopship. The ship was launched on 14 September 1852. On that day the Duke of Wellington died, and she was subsequently re-named in his honour and provided with a new figurehead in the image of the duke. HMS Duke of Wellington in 1853, running under steam and sail - smoke may be seen issuing from her central funnel. Service history When completed on 4 February 1853, HMS Duke of Wellington was, on paper at least, the most powerful warship in the world (and would remain so until the completion of the French Bretagne in 1855) and the largest yet built for the Royal Navy, twice the size of Nelson's Victory and with a far bigger broadside. She was 240 feet (73.1 m) long, displaced 5,892 tons, and carried 131 cannon, weighing a total of 382 tons and mainly firing 32 lb balls. After service in the Western Squadron of the Channel Fleet, she was designated the flagship of the fleet that Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Napier was to lead to the Baltic on the outbreak of the war with Russia (later known as the Crimean War). Duke of Wellington served as his flagship throughout the Baltic campaign of 1854 and returned to the Baltic the following year as the flagship of Napier‚Äôs successor in the command, Rear- Admiral Richard Saunders Dundas, being present at the bombardment of Sveaborg. HMS Duke of Wellington firing a gun salute in Portsmouth Harbour during her time as flagship there. Under trials on 11 April 1853 she had made 10.15 knots under steam, and she proved a magnificent sailing ship, but the second-hand engines turned out distinctly unsatisfactory, and the hurried conversion had compromised her structural strength; she thus saw no active service after the Crimean War and paid off in 1856. She served as guard ship of sailing ordinary at Devonport from 1860 to 1863, then as a receiving ship at Portsmouth from 1863, where she became a familiar and much-photographed sight, always described on postcards as \\"the flagship of Sir Charles Napier\\". She replaced as flagship of the Port Admiral at Portsmouth from 1869 to 1891 (with Victory becoming her tender), firing salutes to passing dignitaries, such as Queen Victoria on her way to Osborne House. She served as flagship for the Commander-in-Chief from 24 October 1884 to 1886 and for Victoria's birthday celebration and fleet review at Portsmouth in 1896 \\"dressed smartly for the occasion\\" (despite having been paid off on 31 March 1888). Fate The personnel stationed on her eventually moved into RN Barracks Portsmouth in 1903 and she was finally sold to be broken up in 1904. Ship's timbers discovered on the Thames foreshore at Charlton have been identified as being from the Duke of Wellington. Sister ships Of her three sisters, all of which received more powerful machinery specially designed for them: *HMS Marlborough was completed to a modified design and served as flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet from 1858‚Äì64; thereafter she too was a receiving ship at Portsmouth, renamed Vernon II, surviving until broken up in 1924. *HMS Prince of Wales was completed to the same design as Marlborough in 1860 but saw no sea service; in 1869 she was renamed Britannia and became the stationary training ship for officer cadets on the River Dart. *HMS Royal Sovereign was completed to the same design as the Duke of Wellington but was cut down to the lower deck and converted in 1862-4 into the first British turret ship to try out the ideas of Captain Cowper Phipps Coles. She was fitted with four turrets mounting 9 inch muzzle-loading rifled guns. She was regarded as primarily experimental and her longest voyage was to Cherbourg in 1865 before becoming the tender to the gunnery school HMS Excellent. She was scrapped in 1885. The Imperial Russian Navy built a ship of its own based on the Duke of Wellington, the Imperator Nikolai I.

Since 1848, the title has been held jointly with the Earldom of Crawford, and the holder is also the hereditary clan chief of Clan Lindsay. The first earl's father was created Lord Lindsay of Balcarres on 27 June 1633. He was the grandson of the 9th Earl of Crawford. The second Lord Lindsay succeeded his father in 1642. A prominent supporter of Charles I, he was further elevated as Earl of Balcarres and Lord Lindsay of Balneil in 1651. During the rule of Oliver Cromwell, the first earl died in exile in Breda in 1659. He was succeeded by Charles, his third but first surviving son, who in turn was succeeded by his younger brother, the third earl. In his youth, the third earl was a courtier of King Charles II after the restoration of the monarchy, but later became devoted to King James VII. He fled to Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye after the Glorious Revolution when it was discovered he was part of a plot to restore James to the English throne. He returned to Scotland around 1701 and was received at the court of Queen Anne. He was stripped of his annuity during the revolution, but not his titles. In January 1808, the ancient Earldom of Crawford, held by members of another branch of the Lindsay family since 1398, became dormant after the death of the George Lindsay-Crawford, 22nd Earl of Crawford. In 1843, James Lindsay, 7th Earl of Balcarres, put forward his claim, based on the research of his eldest son Alexander.Barker, Nicolas (1978) Bibliotheca Lindesiana: the Lives and Collections of Alexander William, 25th Earl of Crawford and 8th Earl of Balcarres, and James Ludovic, 26th Earl of Crawford and 9th Earl of Balcarres. London: for Presentation to the Roxburghe Club, and published by Bernard Quaritch In 1848, the House of Lords allowed the claim. It was held that the seventh Earl's father, the sixth Earl, was the lawful (de jure) successor to the earldom of Crawford (though he did not claim it). Therefore, the sixth Earl of Balcarres was posthumously declared the twenty-third Earl of Crawford, and his son, the seventh Earl of Balcarres, became the twenty-fourth Earl of Crawford. Thereafter, the two earldoms have remained united. The family seat is Balcarres House, near Colinsburgh, Fife.

A former Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), McCallum was the Canadian Ambassador to China from 2017 to 2019. He was asked for his resignation by Prime Minister Trudeau in 2019.Canada‚Äôs new ambassador to Beijing says Ottawa open to ‚Äòmore, more, more‚Äô. Toronto Star, 29 March 2017. As an MP, he represented the electoral district of Markham‚ÄîThornhill, and had previously represented Markham‚ÄîUnionville and Markham. He is a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. A veteran federal politician who began his political career in 2000, McCallum has served in the governments of Liberal prime ministers Jean Chr√©tien, Paul Martin, and Justin Trudeau. McCallum has previously been Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Minister of National Defence, Minister of Veterans Affairs, and Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship.  Early life and education  McCallum was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Joan (Patteson) and Alexander Campbell McCallum. He received his secondary education at Selwyn House School and Trinity College School. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Queens' College, Cambridge University, a dipl√¥me d'√©tudes sup√©rieures from Universit√© de Paris I and a PhD degree in economics from McGill University.  Academic career (1976‚Äì1994)  McCallum was a professor of economics at the University of Manitoba from 1976 until 1978, Simon Fraser University from 1978 until 1982, the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al from 1982 until 1987, and McGill University from 1987 until 1994. He is an honorary member of the Royal Military College of Canada, student . He was also Dean of the Faculty of Arts at McGill University, when his future boss, Justin Trudeau was a student there. He then became Senior Vice-President and Chief Economist of the Royal Bank of Canada. One of his most influential academic contributions was an article in The American Economic Review, which introduced the concept of the home bias in trade puzzle. It has spawned an ongoing international debate on whether trade within a nation state is greater than trade among nations, as compared with the predictions of standard economic models. As McGill University's Dean of Arts, McCallum secured a $10 million contribution from Charles Bronfman for the establishment of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada.\\"McGill gets $10 million for studies on Canada\\". The Gazette (Montreal), 16 June 1993, p. A4. He also participated in the national unity debates of the early 1990s, editing the Canada Round Series of the C. D. Howe Institute and engaging in debate with then Opposition Leader Jacques Parizeau at Quebec's National Assembly.\\"Anti-Quebec vitriol aids PQ: economist McGill professor, Pequiste chief Parizeau wage war of charts\\". The Gazette (Montreal), 5 December 1991, p. A9.  Private sector career (1994‚Äì2000; 2019 onward)  McCallum was the Royal Bank of Canada's chief economist for six years. He consistently achieved the highest media coverage of bank chief economists, making regular appearances on CBC's The National as an economics panellist. He also engaged in social issues, notably a 1997 Royal Bank conference designed to align the business community with the recommendations of the 1996 Report on the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. His paper at that conference, \\"The Cost of Doing Nothing\\", was highlighted ten years later in the Aboriginal Times magazine.Aboriginal Times, Vol. 12, Issue 4, May‚ÄìJune 2007. In July 2020, McCullum's employment by the Wailian Group, a Chinese company that assists with immigration to Canada, sparked calls from oppositions MPs and Democracy Watch for McCullum to be investigated by the Ethics Commissioner for potential breaches of the Conflict of Interest Act.  Political career = Member of Parliament (2000‚Äì2017)  McCallum successfully nominated Nelson Mandela as the second honorary citizen in Canadian history.\\"Nelson Mandela, Citizen\\". Toronto Star, 14 June 2001, p. A32. McCallum was quite vocal in Canada's debate on same-sex marriage. He told the Edmonton Sun in August 2003, \\"If people want to do something and it doesn't hurt other people, doesn't reduce other people's rights, we should let them do it. Why not?\\"Edmonton Sun, 13 August 2003. He also significantly contributed to the final debate before the vote on same-sex marriage on 21 March 2005 saying: > I believe we should always seek to expand the rights of our fellow citizens > as long as we do not thereby reduce the rights of others. We should seek to > ensure that no group is denied full participation in society.

The > essence of my message today is that we cannot do both. We cannot have it > both ways. We must make a choice between traditional marriage and the > protection of minority rights.  Defence Minister (2002‚Äì2003)  As Defence Minister under Jean Chr√©tien, McCallum achieved what was then the largest increase in the annual defence budget ($1 billion) in more than a decade in return for offering up $200 million in savings from reducing low priority spending.The Budget Plan 2003, p. 163. He also retroactively reversed an inequity which awarded up to $250,000 to military personnel who lost their eyesight or a limb while on active service - but only to those with the rank of colonel or above. Now all Canadian Forces members are covered by the plan regardless of rank.Bill C-44, An Act to compensate military members injured during service, 37th Parliament, 2nd session. Working with Germany, he successfully persuaded NATO to take control over the security mission in Kabul, Afghanistan, while also ensuring that the mission was led by Canada.Canadian troops to be deployed to Afghanistan: 2,000 soldiers to join NATO force in Kabul; National Post 6 May 2003, p. A4. He also determined that the army, rather than the navy or air force, was to be the top priority in budget allocations.McCallum sets top priorities; Hill Times, 8 September 2003, p 1. He became widely known and criticized in 2002 when he admitted, while serving as the Minister of National Defence, that he had never heard of the 1942 Dieppe raid, a fateful and nationally significant operation for Canadian Forces during the Second World War. Ironically, he wrote a letter to the editor of the National Post in response, but committed a further gaffe, confusing Canadian participation in the 1917 Battle of Vimy Ridge in France with Vichy France from 1940 to 1944. Response at the continued historical ignorance prompted outrage and humour among the press. In November 2002, while still serving as Defence Minister, McCallum encountered further controversy when officials refused to allow him to board an Air Canada flight because his breath smelt heavily of alcohol. McCallum announced soon thereafter that the incident prompted him to abstain completely from alcohol consumption. He reportedly also intended to lose weight and give up smoking. In January 2003, McCallum suggested Canadian troops could avoid so-called \\"friendly fire\\" incidents by wearing some of female Conservative MP Elsie Wayne's clothes. McCallum later apologized both inside and outside the House of Commons for using inappropriate language, blaming the excitement of the moment, and had his apologies accepted by Wayne. Veterans Affairs Minister (2003‚Äì2004) Under Paul Martin, McCallum introduced a new charter for younger, postwar veterans who have been physically or mentally injured while serving in the Canadian Forces. This charter, which became law in 2005, is modelled on the range of services provided for returning veterans after World War II. This \\"new model\\" stripped veterans of a monthly pension opting for a lump sum payment.  Revenue Minister (2004‚Äì2006)  As Minister of National Revenue and Chair of the Cabinet's Expenditure Review Committee, McCallum achieved in 2005 expenditure reductions of $11 billion over the next five years.\\"McCallum on the hunt for $1-billion more in savings\\". Hill Times, 5 March 2005, p. 56.  Shadow Cabinet Immigration Critic (2006‚Äì2015)  When the Conservatives came to power in January 2006 under Stephen Harper, McCallum was appointed as the Immigration Critic.  Immigration Minister (2015‚Äì2017)  On 4 November 2015, he was appointed the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship in the newly elected 29th Canadian Ministry of Justin Trudeau. As a senior cabinet minister, McCallum was then fourth in line in case of the PM's incapacity. As Immigration Minister, he oversaw the intake of Syrian refugees during the Syrian refugee crisis.  Ambassador to China (2017‚Äì2019)  On 10 January 2017, it was announced that McCallum would be appointed as Canada's Ambassador to China. This resulted in a cabinet reshuffle as he stepped down from his position as the Minister of Immigration and Citizenship to pursue his new post. McCallum expressed eagerness to take on the posting in Beijing, citing his strong personal connections to China, as his former riding Markham has primarily Chinese constituents and both his wife and children are of Chinese ethnicity. On 23 January 2019, McCallum spoke to Chinese-language Canadian and state-owned Chinese media in Markham, Ontario, concerning the detainment and extradition request by the United States, which resulted in the arrest of Huawei deputy chairwoman Meng Wanzhou, who was awaiting court judgement. The United States alleges that Meng Wanzhou is in violation of the United States Sanctions against Iran and the Canadian Federal government reaffirms that they are obligated to follow judicial protocol and that the arrest is not political in nature. McCallum shared his thoughts with the media by restating public facts that could make Meng's legal defence case strong against this extradition request. This included President Donald Trump's political intrusion, which undermined the integrity of the Canadian judicial protocol, thereby contradicting Canada's stance by making it political in nature. Furthermore, McCallum re-stated other well-reported motives the United States could have, citing the alleged intent of the arrest by the United States was to attempt to obtain trade concessions from China. McCallum withdrew his comments, saying he \\"misspoke\\" and that they did \\"not accurately represent position on this issue\\". That week, McCallum is further quoted as later telling a Toronto Star journalist it \\"would be great for Canada\\" if the US extradition request were dropped, conditional on release of Canadians since detained in China. On 26 January 2019, McCallum submitted his resignation as ambassador to China, at the request of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who did not disclose the reasoning behind this decision.  Family  He is married to Malaysian Chinese Nancy Lim () and has three sons (Andrew, Jamie, and Duncan).

A spin-off from the Sonic the Hedgehog series, it features Knuckles the Echidna and four other characters known as the Chaotix, who must prevent Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic from obtaining six magic rings and conquering a mysterious island. Gameplay is similar to previous Sonic games: players complete levels while collecting rings and defeating enemies. Knuckles' Chaotix introduces a partner system whereby the player is connected to another character via a tether; the tether behaves like a rubber band and must be used to maneuver the characters. While Sonic Team is sometimes credited with creating Knuckles' Chaotix, it was developed by another Sega team. Production began with Sonic Crackers, a 1994 prototype for the Sega Genesis which experimented with the tethering system and featured Sonic and Tails. The game was intended for release as a mainline Sonic entry for the Sega Saturn, but transitioned to the 32X when it could not be completed in time. Sonic and Tails were replaced by Knuckles and a group of mostly pre-existing characters; Mighty the Armadillo first appeared in the arcade game SegaSonic the Hedgehog (1993). Knuckles' Chaotix was released in North America and Japan in April 1995, and in Europe in June 1995. It received mixed reviews and failed commercially. Reviewers found the tethering physics cumbersome, although some appreciated it as an attempt to innovate. The level design and low difficulty level were also criticized. Journalists have described Knuckles' Chaotix as the last of the \\"classic\\" 2D Sonic games before the series moved to 3D. Some characters and concepts it introduced feature in later Sonic games and media. Despite interest from fans, it has not been rereleased beyond a brief period through GameTap in the mid-2000s. Gameplay The player (left) builds tension in the tether while anchoring the partner (right) to perform a speed boost. Knuckles' Chaotix is a side-scrolling platform game similar to earlier entries in the Sonic series. Unlike other Sonic games, players are tethered to a computer or human-controlled partner; the tether behaves like a rubber band and must be properly handled to maneuver through stages. There are five playable characters, each with their own unique abilities. Knuckles the Echidna can glide and climb walls; Mighty the Armadillo can perform a wall jump; Espio the Chameleon can run along walls and ceilings; Vector the Crocodile can boost through the air and climb walls; and Charmy Bee can fly and hover. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players' progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story takes place on a mysterious island and follows the group's efforts to stop Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic from harnessing the power of the island's mythical Chaos Rings to satisfy their evil deeds. The game takes place over six levels called attractions. Each attraction is divided into five acts; the fifth ends in a boss fight with Robotnik and one of his large robots. Each act has a different time of day decor, such as morning, noon, evening, and night. Like earlier Sonic games, players collect rings, jump to perform a spin attack to defeat enemies, and can perform a spin dash on the ground to gain speed. Power-ups include rings, shields, and speed shoes. The partner system enables players to perform actions not seen in earlier Sonic games. Players can call their partner if they are separated, which reunites them with the main character but costs 10 rings, or throw their partner to reach far platforms. If the partner is computer-controlled, the player can stop and anchor the partner to perform special moves such as \\"snapping\\" to a higher ledge or thrusting to gain speed. Before entering a stage, the player begins in a hub world where they choose a partner and level. Bonus stages are hidden throughout attractions, and can also be triggered by obtaining 20 or more rings and finding one of the giant golden rings hidden away in each level. In the bonus levels, the player is free-falling and picks up power-ups. Special stages are reached by finishing a level with 50 or more rings. In these stages, the player collects blue spheres in a forward- scrolling platformer to earn a Chaos Ring. Collecting all Chaos Rings unlocks the \\"good\\" ending, in which Sonic and Tails are seen with the Chaotix, who have freed the island from Robotnik. Development The tethering system in Sonic Crackers was the basis for the gameplay in Knuckles' Chaotix. Development on Knuckles' Chaotix began around April 1994 as an engine test for the Sega Genesis dubbed Sonic Crackers. Although Sonic Team is sometimes credited for developing the game, it was developed by another internal Sega development team including young members of the staff who had worked on Sonic CD (1993). Developed as an idea for the next Sonic game, the prototype featured Sonic and Tails joined together by an elastic band of energy.Fahs, Travis. \\"Sonic X-Treme Revisited\\". IGN UK. May 29, 2008. 1 Retrieved on February 13, 2010. \\"There was the experimental multiplayer Sonic Crackers, eventually to become Knuckles Chaotix.\\" According to journalist Ken Horowitz, Sonic Crackers was most likely a submission ROM shown to management to demonstrate new concepts. Some would go onto be used in Sonic 3D Blast (1996), while the level design, tethering, and some music resurfaced in Knuckles' Chaotix. Sega eventually moved development to the Genesis' more powerful 32X add-on. While Horowitz wrote this was because the 16-bit era of consoles was coming to an end, former Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske recalled in a July 2011 interview that Knuckles' Chaotix had been intended for release on the Genesis' successor, the Sega Saturn, as a mainline Sonic game. According to Kalinske, development moved to the 32X when it became clear that the game was not going to be ready for the Saturn in time, saying \\"it was too big, it was taking too long, it was over budgeted, it was behind schedule\\". Because Sega needed new 32X games, \\"the decision was made to cut it into parts and introduce it quickly on 32X\\". By December 1994, the game had been reworked to center around Knuckles the Echidna, who had been introduced in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), and Sonic and Tails were removed. The project had the working title Knuckles' Ringstar. Along with Knuckles in a starring role, the game includes Mighty the Armadillo, who had previously appeared in the arcade exclusive SegaSonic the Hedgehog (1993). Many of Sonic's animations from Crackers were repurposed for Mighty. Vector the Crocodile, created for the original Sonic the Hedgehog (1991) but scrapped before release, also made his debut. The game also features two other new characters: Espio the Chameleon and Charmy Bee, the latter of whom originally appeared in the Sonic the Hedgehog manga. In a retrospective interview, Sonic co-creator Naoto Ohshima recalled he was responsible for repurposing Vector and Charmy, but otherwise had no direct involvement with Knuckles' Chaotix. Espio was the only original character, designed by manga artist Takumi Miyake. A leaked prototype lists Espio as the featured character on the title screen instead of Knuckles, suggesting he was once featured more prominently, possibly in a starring role. The 32X's processing power allowed for dynamic sprite-scaling effects, and 3D polygons in the special stages. A complex palette system allowed each level to load its own unique colors. The music was composed by Junko Siratsu and Mariko Nanba. Knuckles' Chaotix was released in North America in April 1995, in Japan on April 21, 1995, and in Europe in June 1995. According to Horowitz, the game was rushed to help boost sluggish 32X sales. It quickly faded into obscurity, and is now considered a valuable collector's item due to the 32X's commercial failure. The game's only rerelease was in 2005, when it was briefly made available for Mac OS X and Windows computers via the subscription service GameTap. The Sonic Crackers prototype ROM was also leaked online by a Belgian hacking group in June 1995 and can be played with emulators. Cartridge versions are also known to exist; one was auctioned for $146.50 in 2001. While some fans speculate that the Sonic Crackers ROM was an April Fools' Day hoax, its authenticity has been corroborated by multiple sources, including references in an internal Sega design document and text found in a later Knuckles' Chaotix prototype. Reception Knuckles' Chaotix received mixed reviews, and failed commercially, as did the 32X. The game's presentation divided critics. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) praised its graphics and believed the game was one of the best for the 32X, and GameFan considered Knuckles' Chaotix the best entry in the franchise since Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992). On the other hand, a reviewer from Next Generation found the graphics garish, and felt that the game made \\"unimpressive attempts to show off\\". GamePro, Game Players, and IGN believed the game failed to push the 32X to its limits, citing the lack of graphical effects and Genesis-quality audio, though IGN felt some elements, such as several musical tracks, were highlights. In 2008, GamesRadar wrote that Knuckles' Chaotix was the best game for the 32X and was underrated, though it still considered the game a \\"wasted opportunity\\". The \\"rubber band\\" multiplayer system was criticized, despite being acknowledged as an effort to innovate. Though IGN admired the attempt to \\"breathe life into a series that was running out of steam\\" and fix the lopsided multiplayer of Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 (1994), whereby Tails would get lost off-screen, they felt the physics were \\"clunky\\" and unorthodox.Fahs, Travis. \\"Knuckles Chaotix Review\\" IGN. Ziff Davis. March 26, 2008. Retrieved on June 9, 2011. EGM felt the system was original, but slowed down the gameplay, as did GamesRadar. Next Generation felt the bond was tiring and not truly innovative, and GamePro called it Knuckles' Chaotixs biggest flaw, finding it frustrating and choppy. The reviewer also found that the bond complicated gameplay and compared it to being handcuffed. The level design and low difficulty were also criticized. GamePro wrote that the levels, while fairly large, were not populated with enough enemies or secrets, a sentiment echoed by IGN and Mean Machines Sega. IGN considered the boss design simplistic and the level design bland and seemingly unfinished, and Mean Machines Sega thought that, without enemies, \\"this is just not half the game it could have been\\". Game Players criticized the game's lack of replay value, saying the game's simplicity made secrets in levels impossible to miss. However, IGN, GameFan, and EGM praised the number of playable characters, and IGN felt the game's \\"marvelous\\" fully 3D special stages were the best of the Sonic series. Overall, IGN described Knuckles' Chaotix as \\"a bad game with a good foundation\\", and in another article, concluded that the game was interesting, if flawed. EGM felt the game was the best for the 32X but failed to live up to previous games in the Sonic series. Game Players found the game a major disappointment, saying \\"other than a few color-enhanced backgrounds, you're gonna wonder why this isn't a Genesis title\\". Some journalists have referred to Knuckles' Chaotix as the series' declining point, and AllGame and Complex both wrote that it was among the worst games in the series. Legacy Knuckles' Chaotix is considered the last of the \\"classic\\" Sonic games before the 3D game Sonic Adventure (1998) took the series in new gameplay directions. Several of its concepts were re-used in later Sonic games. A similar partner system features in the Game Boy Advance game Sonic Advance 3 (2004), and IGN noted similarities between the game's auto-running special stages and Sonic and the Secret Rings (2007). Two tracks from Knuckles' Chaotix, \\"Tube Panic\\" and \\"Door Into Summer\\", appear in Sonic Generations (2011). The \\"Hyper Ring\\" power-up re-appeared in Sonic Mania (2017) and a recreation of Knuckles' Chaotixs final boss fight was added in a 2018 update. With the exception of Mighty, all Chaotix members have become recurring characters in the Sonic series. The characters initially did not reappear until Sonic Heroes in 2003. Director Takashi Iizuka said that Sonic Team revived the Chaotix because the studio thought they were unique and had never used them. Iizuka considers the Heroes version of the characters different from the 32X one, claiming to have created new characters simply using the same designs. The group had storylines in the Sonic the Hedgehog comic series produced by Archie Comics and Sonic the Comic by Fleetway Publications, as well as in the anime series Sonic X. While Game Informer considered the Chaotix to be among the best characters of the franchise and are underutilized, GamesRadar considered the introduction of the Chaotix a negative turning point for the series as it \\"diluted the Sonic-verse by introducing tons of shitty characters\\". Jim Sterling felt that all the Chaotix lacked redeeming qualities, calling Vector \\"Idiot the Crocodile\\" and Espio \\"Generic Brooder the Chameleon\\". He singled out Charmy for particular ridicule, feeling he was annoying and noting his high-pitched voice. Mighty would eventually return as a playable character in Sonic Mania Plus in 2018. In 2011, Sega noted fans frequently requested Knuckles' Chaotix as a game desired to be rereleased. 1UP.com and GameSpy expressed disappointment the 2005 compilation Sonic Gems Collection did not include the game. In 2010, Sonic Team head Iizuka, expressed interest in developing a sequel. Also expressing interest was Christian Whitehead, the developer of the mobile versions of Sonic CD, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, saying in 2014 that he would be open to remaking Knuckles' Chaotix using the Retro Engine.

The word ambigram was coined by Douglas Hofstadter, an American scholar of cognitive science. Etymology The word ambigram was coined by Douglas Hofstadter, an American scholar of cognitive science, best known as the Pulitzer Prize winning author of the book G√∂del, Escher, Bach. Douglas Hofstadter describes an ambigram as a \\"calligraphic design that manages to squeeze two different readings into the selfsame set of curves.\\" Different ambigram artists (sometimes called ambigramists) may create distinctive ambigrams from the same words, differing in both style and form. History Rotational ambigram Puzzle / the end by Peter Newell, 1893 Although the term is recent, the existence of mirror ambigrams has been attested since at least the first millennium. They are generally palindromes stylized to be visually symmetrical. In ancient Greek, the phrase \\"ŒΩŒπœàŒøŒΩ Œ±ŒΩŒøŒºŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒ± ŒºŒ∑ ŒºŒøŒΩŒ±ŒΩ ŒøœàŒπŒΩ\\" (wash the sins, not only the face), is a palindromeBarry J. Blake, Secret Language: Codes, Tricks, Spies, Thieves, and Symbols, Oxford University Press, 2010, , p. 15. found in several locations, including the site of the church Hagia Sophia, in Istanbul, Turkey. It is sometimes turned into a mirror ambigram when written in capital letters with the removal of spaces, and the stylization of the letter N (Õ∂). The first sator square palindrome was found in the ruins of Pompeii, that means it was created before 79 AD. A sator square using the mirror writing for the representation of the letters S and N was carved in a stone wall in Opp√®de (France) between the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages A boustrophedon is a type of bi-directional text, mostly seen in ancient manuscripts and other inscriptions. Every other line of writing is flipped or reversed, with reversed letters. Rather than going left-to-right as in modern European languages, or right-to-left as in Arabic and Hebrew, alternate lines in boustrophedon must be read in opposite directions. Also, the individual characters are reversed, or mirrored. It was a common way of writing in stone in Ancient Greece. Ottoman mirror ambigram panel depicting the phrase ÿπŸÑŸä ŸàŸÑŸä ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá (Ali is the vicegerent of God, in Arabic), between 1720 and 1730 Mirror writing in Islamic calligraphy flourished during the early modern period, but its origins may stretch as far back as pre-Islamic mirror-image rock inscriptions in the Hejaz. The earliest known non-natural rotational ambigram dates to 1893 by artist Peter Newell. Although better known for his children's books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of reversible illustrations, in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when flipped upside down. The last page in his book Topsys & Turvys contains the phrase THE END, which, when inverted, reads PUZZLE. In Topsys & Turvys Number 2 (1902), Newell ended with a variation on the ambigram in which THE END changes into PUZZLE 2. In March 1904 the Dutch-American comic artist Gustave Verbeek used ambigrams in three consecutive strips of The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins. His comics were ambiguous images, made in such a way that one could read the 6 panel comic, flip the book and keep reading. In The Wonderful Cure of the Waterfall:c:File:Ambigrams by Gustave Verbeek (1904) - comics The Upside Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo - The wonderful cure of the waterfall.jpg () an indian medicine man says 'Big waters would make her very sound', while when flipped the medicine man turns into an Indian woman who says 'punos dery, eay apew poom, serlem big'.:c:File:Ambigrams by Gustave Verbeek (1904) - comics The Upside Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo - The wonderful cure of the waterfall (panel 4).jpg Which is explained as, 'poor deary' several foreign words that meant that she would call the 'Serlem Big'. The next comic called At the House of the Writing Pig (), where two ambigram word balloons are featured. The first features an angry pig trying to make the main protagonist leave by showing a sign that says; 'big boy go away, dis am home of mr h hog', up side down it reads 'Boy yew go away. We sip. Home of hog pig.'.:c:File:Ambigrams by Gustave Verbeek (1904) - comics The Upside Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo - At the house of the writing pig (panel 4).jpg The protagonist asks the pig if it wants a big bun, upon which it replies 'Why big buns? Am mad u!', which flips into 'In pew we sang big hym'.:c:File:Ambigrams by Gustave Verbeek (1904) - comics The Upside Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo - At the house of the writing pig (panel 5).jpg Finally in The Bad Snake and the Good Wizard:c:File:Ambigrams by Gustave Verbeek (1904) - comics The Upside Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo - The bad snake and the good wizard.jpg () there are two more ambigrams. The first turns 'How do you do' into the name of a wizard called 'Opnohop Moy', the second features a squirrel telling the protagonist 'Yes further on' only to inform it that there are 'No serpents here' on his way back.:c:File:Ambigrams by Gustave Verbeek (1904) - comics The Upside Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo - The bad snake and the good wizard (panel 5).jpg These ambigrams are all relatively simple compared to contemporary designs, but given the constraints that Verbeek had due to the drawing and story they are impressive nevertheless. In a 2012 Swedish remake of the book, the artist Marcus Ivarsson redraws The Bad Snake and the Good Wizard in his own style. He removes the squirrel, but keeps the other ambigram. 'How do you do' is replaced by 'Nejnej' (Swedish for no no) and the wizard is now called 'Laulau'. From June to September 1908, the British monthly The Strand published a series of ambigrams by different people in its \\"Curiosities\\" column. Of particular interest is the fact that all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words. Mitchell T. Lavin, whose \\"chump\\" was published in June, wrote, \\"I think it is in the only word in the English language which has this peculiarity,\\" while Clarence Williams wrote, about his \\"Bet\\" ambigram, \\"Possibly B is the only letter of the alphabet that will produce such an interesting anomaly.\\" Rotational faces as optical illusion are very old, since metal coins with reversible figures were produced in 1550, and maybe earlier. In this perspective, a 180¬∞ rotational ambigram \\"¬°OHO!\\" was published in 1946 for the cover of a book gathering reversible drawings by Rex Whistler. Popularity Rotational ambigram logo New Man created by Raymond Loewy in 1969 In 1969, Raymond Loewy designed the rotational ambigram logo, which is still in use in 2020. The mirror ambigram DeLorean Motor Company logo was first used in 1975. In 1977, only the single 1975 prototype existed. Note that there are multiple visible differences between the prototype vehicle and later production models, including the design of the front end. John Langdon and Scott Kim also each believed that they had invented ambigrams in the 1970s. Langdon and Kim are probably the two artists who have been most responsible for the popularization of ambigrams. John Langdon produced the first mirror image logo \\"Starship\\" in 1975. Robert Petrick, who designed the invertible Angel logo in 1976, was also an early influence on ambigrams. The earliest known published reference to the term ambigram was by Hofstadter, who attributed the origin of the word to conversations among a small group of friends during 1983‚Äì1984. The original 1979 edition of Hofstadter's G√∂del, Escher, Bach featured two 3-D ambigrams on the cover. Ambigrams became more popular as a result of Dan Brown incorporating John Langdon's designs into the plot of his bestseller, Angels & Demons, and the DVD release of the Angels & Demons movie contains a bonus chapter called \\"This is an Ambigram\\". Langdon also produced the ambigram that was used for some versions of the book's cover. Brown used the name Robert Langdon for the hero in his novels as an homage to John Langdon. In music, the Grateful Dead have used ambigrams several times, including on their albums Aoxomoxoa and American Beauty. In the first series of the British show Trick or Treat, the show's host and creator Derren Brown uses cards with rotational ambigrams. These cards can read either 'Trick' or 'Treat'. Although the words spelled by most ambigrams are relatively short in length, one DVD cover for The Princess Bride movie creates a rotational ambigram out of two words: \\"Princess Bride,\\" whether viewed right side up or upside down. In 2015 iSmart's logo on one of its travel chargers went viral because the brand's name turned out to be a natural ambigram that read \\"+Jews!\\" upside down. The company noted that \\"...we learned a powerful lesson of what not to do when creating a logo.‚Äù Types ambigram ¬´ Upside Down ¬ª Biden USA Harris‚Äù with rotational symmetry of 180 degrees, created and drawn by Douglas Hofstadter for the 2020 United States presidential election. Ambigrams are exercises in graphic design that play with optical illusions, symmetry and visual perception. Some ambigrams feature a relationship between their form and their content. Ambigrams usually fall into one of several categories: ; 3-Dimensional : A design where an object is presented that will appear to read several letters or words when viewed from different angles. Such designs can be generated using constructive solid geometry. ; Chain :A design where a word (or sometimes words) are interlinked, forming a repeating chain. Letters are usually overlapped meaning that a word will start partway through another word. Sometimes chain ambigrams are presented in the form of a circle. ; Dihedral: A natural mirror-image ambigram consisting of numerical digits. ; Figure-ground :A design in which the spaces between the letters of one word form another word. ; Fractal : A version of space-filling ambigrams where the tiled word branches from itself and then shrinks in a self-similar manner, forming a fractal. See Scott Kim's fractal of the word \\"TREE\\" for an animated example. ; Mirror-image :A design that can be read when reflected in a mirror, usually as the same word or phrase both ways. Ambigrams that form different words when viewed in the mirror are also known as glass door ambigrams, because they can be printed on a glass door to be read differently when entering or exiting. ; Multi-Lingual : An ambigram that can be read one way in one language and another way in a different language. Multi-lingual ambigrams can exist in all of the various styles of ambigrams, with multi-lingual perceptual shift ambigrams being particularly striking. The name sinosign has been proposed for the case of the shift being between Latin script and Chinese script. ; Natural :A natural ambigram is a word that possesses one or more of the above symmetries when written in its natural state, requiring no typographic styling. For example, the words \\"dollop\\", \\"suns\\" and \\"pod\\" form natural rotational ambigrams. In Korean, Í≥∞ (bear) and Î¨∏ (door) form a natural rotational ambigram. In some fonts, the word \\"swims\\" forms a natural rotational ambigram. The word \\"bud\\" forms a natural mirror ambigram when reflected over a vertical axis, as does \\"ŸÑŸäÿ®Ÿäÿß\\", the name of the country Libya in Arabic. The words \\"CHOICE\\" and \\"OXIDE\\", in all capitals, form natural mirror ambigrams when reflected over a horizontal axis. The longest such word is CHECKBOOK. The word \\"TOOTH\\", in all capitals, forms a natural mirror ambigram when its letters are stacked vertically and reflected over a vertical axis. See the article transformation of text for a discussion of letter symmetry. ;Perceptual Shift (Oscillation) :A design with no symmetry but can be read as two different words depending on how the curves of the letters are interpreted. ; Rotational : A design that presents several instances of words when rotated through a fixed angle. This is usually 180 degrees, but rotational ambigrams of other angles exist, for example 90 or 45 degrees. The word spelled out from the alternative direction(s) is often the same, but may be a different word to the initially presented form. A simple example is the lower-case abbreviation for \\"Down\\", dn, which looks like the lower-case word up when rotated 180 degrees. ; Strobogrammatic: A natural rotational ambigram consisting of numerical digits. ; Space-Filling : Similar to chain ambigrams, but tile to fill the 2-dimensional plane. ; Spinonym : An ambigram in which all the letters are made of the same glyph, possibly rotated and/or inverted. WEB is an example of a word that can easily be made into a spinonym. Previously called rotoglyphs or rotaglyphs.See Hofstadter, Ambigrammi, p. 48. ; Symbiotogram : An ambigram that, when rotated, can be read as a different word than the original, e.g., \\"LIFE\\" would read as \\"DEATH\\". Creating ambigrams=Handmade designs Handmade ambigram for a tattoo ¬´ New York / Rich Man ¬ª There are no universal guidelines for creating ambigrams, and there are different ways of approaching problems. A number of books suggest methods for creation (including WordPlay and Eye Twisters). Ambigram generators Computerized methods to automatically create ambigrams have been developed. Most of them function on the simplified principle of mapping a single letter to another single letter. Because of this weakness, most of them can only map a word to itself or to another word that is the same length and do not combine letters. Thus, the generated ambigrams are in general of poor quality when compared to hand made ambigrams. More sophisticated techniques employ databases of thousands of curves to create complex ambigrams. Most ambigram generators are free, while some others require payment.

It is a type of welding that uses a welding power supply to create an electric arc between a metal stick (\\"electrode\\") and the base material to melt the metals at the point of contact. Arc welders can use either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) current, and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. The welding area is usually protected by some type of shielding gas, vapor, or slag. Arc welding processes may be manual, semi-automatic, or fully automated. First developed in the late part of the 19th century, arc welding became commercially important in shipbuilding during the Second World War. Today it remains an important process for the fabrication of steel structures and vehicles. Power supplies Engine driven welder capable of AC/DC welding. A diesel powered welding generator (the electric generator is on the left) as used in Indonesia. To supply the electrical energy necessary for arc welding processes, a number of different power supplies can be used. The most common classification is constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the voltage is directly related to the length of the arc, and the current is related to the amount of heat input. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance. The direction of current used in arc welding also plays an important role in welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In general, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration (around 60%). \\"Note that for stick welding in general, DC+ polarity is most commonly used. It produces a good bead profile with a higher level of penetration. DC- polarity results in less penetration and a higher electrode melt-off rate. It is sometimes used, for example, on thin sheet metal in an attempt to prevent burn-through.\\" \\"With few exceptions, electrode-positive (reversed polarity) results in deeper penetration. Electrode-negative (straight polarity) results in faster melt-off of the electrode and, therefore, faster deposition rate.\\" Non-consumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current (DC), as well as alternating current (AC). With direct current however, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, eliminating low-voltage time after the zero crossings and minimizing the effects of the problem. Duty cycle is a welding equipment specification which defines the number of minutes, within a 10-minute period, during which a given arc welder can safely be used. For example, an 80 A welder with a 60% duty cycle must be \\"rested\\" for at least 4 minutes after 6 minutes of continuous welding.What does welder \\"duty cycle\\" mean? http://www.zena.net/htdocs/FAQ/dutycycle.shtml Failure to observe duty cycle limitations could damage the welder. Commercial- or professional-grade welders typically have a 100% duty cycle. Consumable electrode methods Shielded metal arc welding One of the most common types of arc welding is shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), which is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMAW) or stick welding. An electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and a consumable electrode rod or stick. The electrode rod is made of a material that is compatible with the base material being welded and is covered with a flux that gives off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and provide a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary. The process is very versatile, requiring little operator training and inexpensive equipment. However, weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though specialty electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminium, copper and other metals. The versatility of the method makes it popular in a number of applications including repair work and construction. Gas metal arc welding (GMAW), commonly called MIG (for metal/inert-gas), is a semi-automatic or automatic welding process with a continuously fed consumable wire acting as both electrode and filler metal, along with an inert or semi-inert shielding gas flowed around the wire to protect the weld site from contamination. Constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current alternating current are used as well. With continuously fed filler electrodes, GMAW offers relatively high welding speeds; however the more complicated equipment reduces convenience and versatility in comparison to the SMAW process. Originally developed for welding aluminium and other non-ferrous materials in the 1940s, GMAW was soon economically applied to steels. Today, GMAW is commonly used in industries such as the automobile industry for its quality, versatility and speed. Because of the need to maintain a stable shroud of shielding gas around the weld site, it can be problematic to use the GMAW process in areas of high air movement such as outdoors. Flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) is a variation of the GMAW technique. FCAW wire is actually a fine metal tube filled with powdered flux materials. An externally supplied shielding gas is sometimes used, but often the flux itself is relied upon to generate the necessary protection from the atmosphere. The process is widely used in construction because of its high welding speed and portability. Submerged arc welding (SAW) is a high-productivity welding process in which the arc is struck beneath a covering layer of granular flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself and, combined with the use of a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes since the flux hides the arc and no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products. As the arc is not visible, it is typically automated. SAW is only possible in the 1F (flat fillet), 2F (horizontal fillet), and 1G (flat groove) positions. Non-consumable electrode methods Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), or tungsten/inert-gas (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a non-consumable electrode made of tungsten, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material. Especially useful for welding thin materials, this method is characterized by a stable arc and high quality welds, but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished at relatively low speeds. It can be used on nearly all weldable metals, though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and marine applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method can be used on a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium; automated welding of stainless steel is one important application of the process. A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, carbon arc welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding. Corrosion issues Some materials, notably high-strength steels, aluminium, and titanium alloys, are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. If the electrodes used for welding contain traces of moisture, the water decomposes in the heat of the arc and the liberated hydrogen enters the lattice of the material, causing its brittleness. Stick electrodes for such materials, with special low-hydrogen coating, are delivered in sealed moisture-proof packaging. New electrodes can be used straight from the can, but when moisture absorption may be suspected, they have to be dried by baking (usually at ) in a drying oven. Flux used has to be kept dry as well.Drive Off Moisture and Get Better Welds Some austenitic stainless steels and nickel-based alloys are prone to intergranular corrosion. When subjected to temperatures around for too long a time, chromium reacts with carbon in the material, forming chromium carbide and depleting the crystal edges of chromium, impairing their corrosion resistance in a process called sensitization. Such sensitized steel undergoes corrosion in the areas near the welds where the temperature-time was favorable for forming the carbide. This kind of corrosion is often termed weld decay. Knifeline attack (KLA) is another kind of corrosion affecting welds, impacting steels stabilized by niobium. Niobium and niobium carbide dissolves in steel at very high temperatures. At some cooling regimes, niobium carbide does not precipitate, and the steel then behaves like unstabilized steel, forming chromium carbide instead. This affects only a thin zone several millimeters wide in the very vicinity of the weld, making it difficult to spot and increasing the corrosion speed. Structures made of such steels have to be heated in a whole to about , when the chromium carbide dissolves and niobium carbide forms. The cooling rate after this treatment is not important.Intergranular Corrosion Filler metal (electrode material) improperly chosen for the environmental conditions can make them corrosion- sensitive as well. There are also issues of galvanic corrosion if the electrode composition is sufficiently dissimilar to the materials welded, or the materials are dissimilar themselves. Even between different grades of nickel-based stainless steels, corrosion of welded joints can be severe, despite that they rarely undergo galvanic corrosion when mechanically joined.Galvanic Corrosion Safety issues Welding safety checklist Welding can be a dangerous and unhealthy practice without the proper precautions; however, with the use of new technology and proper protection the risks of injury or death associated with welding can be greatly reduced. Heat, fire, and explosion hazard Because many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns from heat and sparks is significant. To prevent them, welders wear protective clothing in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat, flames, and sparks. The use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes also pose an explosion and fire risk; some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace. Eye damage Auto darkening welding hood with 90√ó110 mm cartridge and 3.78√ó1.85 in viewing area Exposure to the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding goggles and helmets with dark face plates‚Äîmuch darker than those in sunglasses or oxy-fuel goggles‚Äîare worn to prevent this exposure. In recent years, new helmet models have been produced featuring a face plate which automatically self-darkens electronically.http://ohsonline.com/articles/2005/10/through-a-glass- darkly.aspx To protect bystanders, transparent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc. Inhaled matter Welders are also often exposed to dangerous gases and particulate matter. Processes like flux-cored arc welding and shielded metal arc welding produce smoke containing particles of various types of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, many processes produce various gases (most commonly carbon dioxide and ozone, but others as well) that can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Interference with pacemakers Certain welding machines which use a high frequency alternating current component have been found to affect pacemaker operation when within 2 meters of the power unit and 1 meter of the weld site. History Nikolay Benardos While examples of forge welding go back to the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, arc welding did not come into practice until much later. In 1800 Humphry Davy discovered the short pulsed electric arcs.Hertha Ayrton. The Electric Arc, pp. 20 and 94. D. Van Nostrand Co., New York, 1902. Independently a Russian physicist Vasily Petrov discovered the continuous electric arc in 1802 and subsequently proposed its possible practical applications, including welding. Arc welding was first developed when Nikolai Benardos presented arc welding of metals using a carbon electrode at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris in 1881, which was patented together with Stanis≈Çaw Olszewski in 1887. In the same year, French electrical inventor Auguste de M√©ritens also invented a carbon arc welding method, patented in 1881, which was successfully used for welding lead in the manufacture of lead-acid batteries. The advances in arc welding continued with the invention of metal electrodes in the late 19th century by a Russian, Nikolai Slavyanov (1888), and an American, C. L. Coffin. Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger released in Britain a coated metal electrode which gave a more stable arc. In 1905 Russian scientist Vladimir Mitkevich proposed the usage of three-phase electric arc for welding. In 1919, alternating current welding was invented by C.J. Holslag but did not become popular for another decade. Competing welding processes such as resistance welding and oxyfuel welding were developed during this time as well; but both, especially the latter, faced stiff competition from arc welding especially after metal coverings (known as flux) for the electrode, to stabilize the arc and shield the base material from impurities, continued to be developed. A young woman arc welding in a munitions factory in Australia in 1943. During World War I welding started to be used in shipbuilding in Great Britain in place of riveted steel plates. The Americans also became more accepting of the new technology when the process allowed them to repair their ships quickly after a German attack in the New York Harbor at the beginning of the war. Arc welding was first applied to aircraft during the war as well, and some German airplane fuselages were constructed using this process. In 1919, the British shipbuilder Cammell Laird started construction of a merchant ship, the \\"Fullagar\\", with an entirely welded hull;Royal Naval & World Events time line she was launched in 1921.Case Studies on Shipbuilding During the 1920s, major advances were made in welding technology, including the 1920 introduction of automatic welding in which electrode wire was continuously fed. Shielding gas became a subject receiving much attention as scientists attempted to protect welds from the effects of oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Porosity and brittleness were the primary problems and the solutions that developed included the use of hydrogen, argon, and helium as welding atmospheres. During the following decade, further advances allowed for the welding of reactive metals such as aluminum and magnesium. This, in conjunction with developments in automatic welding, alternating current, and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and then during World War II. During the middle of the century, many new welding methods were invented. Submerged arc welding was invented in 1930 and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric arc welding. Gas tungsten arc welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941 and gas metal arc welding followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Using a consumable electrode and a carbon dioxide atmosphere as a shielding gas, it quickly became the most popular metal arc welding process. In 1957, the flux-cored arc welding process debuted in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds. In that same year, plasma arc welding was invented. Electroslag welding was released in 1958 and was followed by its cousin, electrogas welding, in 1961.

Through his daughters, for whom he arranged excellent dynastic marriages, he is an ancestor of several members of European royal houses today, including the reigning monarchs King Harald V of Norway, King Philippe of Belgium, and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg. Early life Prince Carl of Sweden and Norway as a child, 1869 Carl was the third son and child of King Oscar II of Sweden-Norway by his wife, Sophia of Nassau. He was known as \\"the Blue Prince\\" (Bl√• Prinsen) because he often wore the blue-coloured uniform of the Life Regiment, to which he belonged in a ceremonial manner.http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l√•ng/bl√•-prinsen Marriage and children King Oscar II of Sweden and his son Carl, Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland, 1879. Portrait of the Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland, 1882. In May 1897, Prince Carl was engaged to Princess Ingeborg of Denmark, the second daughter of King Frederick VIII of Denmark. Ingeborg's mother, Louise of Sweden, was a first cousin of Prince Carl. Nevertheless, in 1947, on the occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary, Carl admitted that their marriage had been completely arranged by their respective fathers, and Ingeborg herself added : \\"I married a complete stranger!\\". The couple were married on 27 August 1897 at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen and spent their wedding trip (honeymoon) in Germany. The marriage, arranged by their fathers and completely conventional in every way, was entirely harmonious. The couple had four children: # Margaretha (1899‚Äì1977), who married Prince Axel of Denmark # M√§rtha (1901‚Äì1954), wife of Crown Prince Olav of Norway and mother of Harald V of Norway # Astrid (1905‚Äì1935), wife of Leopold III of Belgium and mother of kings Baudouin and Albert II of Belgium, as also of Grand Duchess Jos√©phine Charlotte of Luxembourg. # Carl, Duke of √ñsterg√∂tland, known as Carl Jr., later Prince Bernadotte (1911‚Äì2003). Growing up in a conventional and harmonious family, and inculcated with traditional family values in their childhood, all of Carl's children grew up to be happy and constructive adults, healthy in mind and body. While all three daughters made dynastic marriages that were encouraged by their parents, and became the matriarchs of their own successful families, the couple's only son gave up his (highly improbable) chance of succeeding to the throne to marry a noblewoman, with whom he did have a successful marriage. Candidate for the Norwegian throne In 1905, during the political struggle in which Norway obtained its independence from Sweden, Prince Carl was seriously considered as a candidate for the Norwegian crown. It was thought that electing a Swedish prince as king was a less radical way for Norway to secede from the union, and hence a more peaceful approach. Carl was chosen because his eldest brother would inherit the Swedish throne, and his second brother had renounced his royal status to make an unsuitable marriage. However, Carl's father King Oscar II of Sweden did not approve of the proposal, as he saw the whole \\"riot\\" which precipitated the Norwegian crisis as a conspiracy and a betrayal against his rights as King of Norway, and he did not want any of his sons to be involved with people who he considered his enemies. Therefore, Prince Carl never became King of Norway. Instead, Prince Carl of Denmark was elected after some diplomatic turbulence, taking the name Haakon VII. As history turned out however, Prince Carl's daughter, Princess M√§rtha, married Haakon VII's son, the later King Olav V. The present King Harald V of Norway is hence a grandchild of Prince Carl, Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland. Legacy Prince Carl has the distinction of being a grandfather of three reigning European monarchs: King Harald V of Norway (son of his daughter, Princess M√§rtha), the late King Baudouin of Belgium and his brother, King Albert II of Belgium (sons of his daughter, Princess Astrid). He is also a great-grandfather of King Philippe of Belgium and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg.

Yglesias traveled to the United States and to Europe to further his education. He also studied law at the university of Santo Tomas, but was unable to complete his studies due to his parents' economic difficulties at the time. He went into business, but did not meet with much success in that arena. He got married in a civil ceremony to Rosa Banuet Ross, in the capital of Cartago. They had two girls, Berta and Rosa (*official records of this marriage were destroyed in the earthquake of Cartago in 1910). He served as Minister of War (1890-1894). Yglesias and Rosa were divorced due to family pressure, and he married Manuela Petronila de la Trinidad Rodr√≠guez Alvarado, daughter of president Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Rodr√≠guez Zeled√≥n (1890-1894). She was a private woman, and did not share his enthusiasm for the political arena. They had a happy domestic partnership, and produced eleven children; Miguel, Eduardo, Luisa, Eudoxia, Bernardo Rafael, Margarita, Maria de los Angeles, Manuel, Jose Maria and Rafael. Presidency In 1894, at the age of 33, Yglesias was elected president by a majority of 23,000, and his election was marked with by largest voter turnout to date. Upon his election, he made official visits to Paris and London. He had an audience with Queen Victoria, for whom he had great respect. Duly impressed by the technological advancements he saw in Europe, he decided to return to Costa Rica and usher his country into the 20th century. Yglesias's substantial progress was due mostly to his indefatigable energy and determination, and to the world's enthusiasm as it stood on the brink of a new century. Yglesias's presidency can be characterized as the bridge between the old world and the new. His accomplishments were evident in every area; finance, health, education, politics, industry and the arts. He completed the construction of a national theater (Teatro Nacional), and was present at its inauguration, the opera \\"Faust\\", presented by a French company under the auspices of Frederic Aubrey. He established the colon as the unit of currency, and put Costa Rica on the gold standard. He completed the Atlantic to Pacific railway, and built up the coastal town of Puerto Limon. In addition, he set up a department of sanitation in the city. He oversaw the building of an electric tram, and brought municipal electricity to the city of Heredia. He established a house of correction for minors. He also instituted educational reforms, establishing a precedent for text books to be authored by Costa Rican citizens. A firm believer in public education, he founded a school for the arts (Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes) in 1897. Yglesias was ahead of his time in terms of the environment, and was the first president to send a scientific expedition to Isla del Coco. Hearing of its rich natural resources, Yglesias closed the penal colony that was there, and decreed the island a nature preserve. Ever conscious of health issues, Yglesias established a system of emergency health care in the provinces. In 1895, Congress approved a measure to create a board of medicine, surgery and pharmacy, composed of all the doctors, surgeons and pharmacists that had been nationally certified. In 1902, he established the pharmaceutical college (Instituto de Farmacia). He tried to amend the constitution to allow for a third term, but was defeated. He ran for president again in 1909 and 1913, but was never re-elected. Later life and death Yglesias still kept his hand in politics, and served, in 1919, as Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Guatemala. Yglesias died in San Jose in 1924, and was buried in the Cementerio General de San Jose. In 1981 he was awarded \\"Benemerito de la Patria\\" for his years of service.

He authored many books (primarily in Swedish) as Prins Wilhelm. Personal life King Gustaf V at 1912 Summer Olympics Wilhelm was born at Tullgarn Palace, the second son of King Gustaf V of Sweden and his wife Victoria of Baden. Marriage and divorce On 3 May 1908, in Tsarskoye Selo, Wilhelm married Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, a daughter of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia by his first wife Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark. The bride was a cousin of the reigning Russian tsar, Nicholas II. The couple had only one son: Prince Lennart, Duke of Sm√•land and later Count of Wisborg (1909‚Äì2004). The marriage was unhappy. Their son, Lennart, later wrote an autobiography in which he revealed several details of the Swedish royal family. The autobiography tells of how Maria, like her aunt and namesake the duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, felt that she had married beneath herself in marrying a younger son of the King of Sweden, and this caused problems of ego between the couple. Maria insisted that the servants address her by her correct style Your Imperial and Royal Highness, to the chagrin of her husband, who was merely a Royal Highness. When apprised of the matter, Wilhelm's father King Gustav V had no choice but to acquiesce with his daughter-in-law's wish, which was perfectly valid in law, and ordered that the imperial style be used invariably for Maria. Maria sought a divorce because of what she described as the horror she then felt toward the Swedish royal family, due to their unlimited support of their official physician, Axel Munthe, who had accosted her sexually.Lennart Bernadotte in K√§re prins, godnatt! pp. 155-158 The divorce was granted in 1914, and Maria returned to Russia. Later life Wilhelm had a relationship, which was not publicly known, with Jeanne de Tramcourt which lasted from around 1914 (starting date unknown) until Jeanne's death in 1952. They lived together for more than 30 years on the estate Stenhammar near Flen. This was at a time when cohabitation was very unusual and not officially allowed to occur among royalty. Jeanne de Tramcourt was therefore called his \\"hostess\\" at Stenhammar. On 2 January 1952 she died in a car accident in a snowstorm near Stj√§rnhov in S√∂dermanland, when they were on their way to Stenhammar after visiting Wilhelm's son Lennart. Wilhelm was driving when the accident took place. After this tragedy, he is said never to have recovered. Career and interests Wilhelm was a noted photographer and the author of several books written in Swedish under the nom de plume Prins Wilhelm.Amerika fr√•n estraden 1928K√§nner du landet 1950 In keeping with protocol demanded of royalty in modern democracies, Wilhelm kept studiously away from politics. One of his rare forays into the political sphere happened during the Second World War, following the murder of the Danish playwright and Lutheran pastor Kaj Munk on 4 January 1944. It was alleged, perhaps correctly, that the occupying German forces (specifically the Gestapo) were behind the murder, and the Danish resistance newspaper De frie Danske carried condemnatory reactions from numerous influential Scandinavians. Wilhelm was one of those who condemned the murder. Death The simple grave of Prince Wilhelm and his first daughter-in-law Karin (Nissvandt) Bernadotte in Flen Wilhelm died in his sleep, from a heart attack, in Flen, just 12 days before his 81st birthday.

He studied law at the University of San Carlos of Guatemala, but owing to family matters and economic circumstances he had to break off his studies and return to Costa Rica. However, he did eventually graduate with a law degree from the Universidad de Santo Tom√°s in San Jos√©. He was a prestigious lawyer who had never made any active forays into the country's politics, but he had distinguished himself as the Magistrate of the Supreme Court of Justice (Corte Suprema de Justicia). For a short time he also occupied the post of Secretary of State in Bernardo Soto's government. He attained the presidency by being elected with a considerable majority, ushering in a new era for the country that would end with imposed governments. Rodr√≠guez sought the clergy's support to be able to govern. The liberals became alarmed and decided to support the president, who accepted this group's collaboration, succeeding in beating the Catholic Party in the midterm elections for deputies. In 1892, he dissolved the Congress, and even as dictator kept the title President. In 1893 he established once again individual guarantees so that voting for his successor could go ahead with greater freedom. The winner was the Minister of War and the Navy, Don Rafael Yglesias Castro, the Civil Party candidate. Rodr√≠guez had to govern during a time of great conflict and his main preoccupation was his homeland's welfare. His methods of keeping order have been censured by the citizenry. Among his successes are his measures favouring education. He established night schools for adults in the national capital and provincial cities. He hailed the contract to establish the telephone service in the capital and the provinces. He started construction on the National Theatre. Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Rodr√≠guez Zeled√≥n died on 30 November 1917.  Personal life  Rodr√≠guez's parents were Sebasti√°n Rodr√≠guez Mora and Francisca Zeled√≥n Aguilar. His wife was Luisa Alvarado Carrillo. They had several children together and, coincidentally, one of them, Manuela Rodr√≠guez Alvarado, married Rodr√≠guez's successor, Rafael Yglesias Castro.  Rodr√≠guez's main successes  * He signed contracts to establish Costa Rica's first telephone service in 1891. * He favoured education and created night schools for adults. * He started construction on the National Theatre in 1890. * He promoted European immigration for the country's colonization and agricultural development.

He was chairman of the parliamentary club of the Civic Platform party from 2003 to 2005. Biography Jan Rokita was born as a son of Tadeusz Rokita and Adela Wajdowicz. His maternal grandmother, Maria Meder, was Austrian.Wybierzmy przesz≈Ço≈õƒá!, Rafa≈Ç Ple≈õniak Rokita graduated from the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w with a degree in law. He joined the dissident organisation \\"Freedom and Peace\\". He also took part in the Independent Students Union and was active as a member of the academic branch of Solidarity. For his activity in the opposition, he was banned from becoming an apprentice attorney, despite his excellent examination record. In 1989, he was elected an MP as a Solidarity candidate. He was appointed the president of a special parliamentary commission for the investigation of the Security Service (S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa). In 1991, he joined Democratic Union (UD) party. He was a member of the party's right wing. In Hanna Suchocka's government, he was the chief of the Council of Ministers office. In 1995, he was the co-founder of the \\"3/4 initiative\\" ‚Äì a movement created in order to prevent Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski from winning the presidential elections and refused to support his party's candidate Jacek Kuro≈Ñ. In 1997, he left Freedom Union (successor of the UD) and joined another political party ‚Äì Conservative People's Party. He was elected to the Sejm for the fourth time from Solidarity Electoral Action coalition list, becoming chairman of the parliamentary Interior Affairs Committee. In 2000 he was elected leader of the SKL. When the Civic Platform was formed in January 2000, Rokita was reluctant to ally SKL with it, but a steady trickle of members to the new center right party forced him to. In 2001, Rokita was elected to the Sejm for the fifth time, as a PO candidate. In 2002, he ran for office to be Mayor of Krak√≥w, but without success. In 2003, he was elected to Sejm's special investigative committee for the Lew Rywin affair. His participation in the committee has given him a tough inquisitor image and made him very popular, effectively resurrecting him as an active politician. In consequence, PO's opinion polls ratings skyrocketed. When the negotiations for the future European constitution started in the end of 2003, he coined the slogan: \\"Nicea o muerte ‚Äì Nicea albo ≈õmierƒá\\" ((Treaty of) Nice or death), which was more or less the official position of the Polish delegation. He later softened his position on the constitution. His first wife was Katarzyna Zimmerer, Polish-Jewish journalist. Now Rokita is married to his second wife Nelly Rokita, an ethnic German from Chelyabinsk, Russia. Nelly has a daughter from her first marriage. In July 2007, he was sentenced to pay a fine for calling Grzegorz Wieczerzak \\"a very famous criminal\\". On 14 September 2007, Rokita announced he would not be seeking re-election in the 2007 Polish elections. Officially, he claimed it was because of his wife Nelly's decision to enter Polish politics as an advisor to President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski (affiliated with the right-wing Law and Justice Party). However, it was well documented that in the run up to the elections he and his supporters within the Civic Platform had become increasingly marginalised, and he claimed he could not communicate with section of Civic Platform in Krak√≥w. Despite this, he did not leave Civic Platform and went on record that he would cast his vote for the party.

It can trace its origins to 1865, when it was founded as the Oxford School of Art. It became a university in 1992 and was renamed to honour its former principal, John Henry Brookes. Oxford Brookes University is spread across four campuses, with three primary sites based in and around Oxford and the fourth campus located in Swindon. In 2020 Oxford Brookes University won its appeal against the local council to demolish its Wheatley campus and build houses on the site. Brookes has approximately 18,000 students, 2,800 staff and over 130,000 alumni in over 189 countries. The university is divided into four faculties: Oxford Brookes Business School, Health and Life Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, and Technology, Design and Environment. Oxford Brookes University's partnership with the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) allows ACCA students to earn a BSc (Hons) in applied accounting with the submission of a research and analysis project work while taking their ACCA examinations. The university also has schools of architecture and law. Brookes is a member of the University Alliance mission group. History Oxford Brookes University started in 1865 as the Oxford School of Art, located in a single room on the ground floor of the Taylor Institution at St Giles', Oxford. In 1870 the School of Science was added and in 1891, under the administration of the City Council's Technical Instruction Committee, it was renamed the Oxford City Technical School, incorporating the School of Art, which remained distinct. Plans were made to relocate to the former Blue Coat School for Boys on St. Ebbes. In 1934 the School of Art and the Technical School were merged and John Henry Brookes, head of the School of Art and vice-principal of the Technical School, was appointed the first principal of the merged institution. By 1950 the college had 4,000 students. A new campus was built on a site offered by the local Morrell brewing family. Renamed \\"Oxford College of Technology\\", it opened on the new site in 1956. Its first residence hall was established in 1960 and the college relocated to Headington in 1963. In 1970, it became Oxford Polytechnic. In 1976, it took over the former Lady Spencer-Churchill College, which had been founded in Wheatley in August 1965. In 1992 it incorporated the Dorset House School of Occupational Therapy, the first school of occupational therapy in the UK. Later in 1992, following enactment of the Further and Higher Education Act, it became Oxford Brookes University, the only one of the new universities to be named after its founder. In 2000, it took over the site of Westminster College, Oxford, basing its education and theological activities on the site, although theology was withdrawn in 2015. In October 2003, Oxford Brookes University became the first university in the world to be awarded Fairtrade status. Baroness Kennedy served as the university's chancellor from 1994 to 2001. In 2007, Graham Upton retired as vice-chancellor and his successor, Janet Beer, was inaugurated in September. In July 2008, Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, replaced Jon Snow as chancellor. In March 2015, Alistair Fitt was inaugurated as vice-chancellor, replacing Janet Beer. Dame Katherine Grainger, a former British Olympic rower, replaced Shami Chakrabarti as chancellor. Grainger is Britain's most decorated female Olympic athlete and the first British woman to win medals at five successive games (Rio 2016, London 2012, Beijing in 2008, Athens in 2004 and Sydney in 2000). She was made a dame for her services to rowing and charity in the 2017 New Years Honours. In 2015, Oxford Brookes University celebrated its 150th anniversary. A range of events and activities took place, including celebrations recognising John Henry Brookes, the university's modern founder. The first founder's day was held in May 2016. Campuses Oxford Brookes University has three main campuses and a fourth in Swindon. ;Headington Campus 250x250px 250x250px The Headington campus is in a residential area of Oxford. The campus is made up of three sites; the main site on Gipsy Lane, home to a number of departments from across the university's four academic faculties and the ¬£132m John Henry Brookes Building which opened in 2014. Across the road is the Headington Hill Hall site, home to the School of Arts and School of Law, and a short walk from main site is the Marston Road site a dedicated space for the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences and home to subjects including nursing, midwifery and occupational therapy. Located on the campus are the main halls of residence, including Crescent Hall, Cheney Student Village, Clive Booth Hall, Clive Booth non-en suite (formerly Morrell Hall), Warneford Hall and Paul Kent Hall. ;Wheatley Campus The Wheatley campus is near Wheatley in the Oxfordshire countryside, seven miles south-east of the city centre. It is where information technology, mathematics and engineering are taught. The tall tower block can be seen from the A40 dual carriageway. The top four floors of the tower were initially closed in the early 2000s following the suicide of a student from the top. Five years later the rest of the tower was shut after asbestos was found and the building was deemed unsafe to house students. The campus is set for closure in 2021, when the subjects taught at Wheatley are due to be moved to the Headington campus. ;Harcourt Hill campus The Harcourt Hill campus is situated on Harcourt Hill on Oxford's western perimeter, two and a half miles from the city centre. Education, philosophy, religion, theology, media and communication, and other subjects are taught here. It has two halls of residence: Harcourt Hill Hall and Westminster Hall. A regular devoted bus service links the campus to other campuses at Headington and Wheatley. It is also home to the university's leisure centre. The campus was formerly the site of Westminster College, Oxford, an independent Methodist higher education institution which specialised in teacher training and theology. The campus was leased to Brookes by the Methodist Church, and Westminster College became the Westminster Institute of Education of Oxford Brookes University, located at the Harcourt Hill campus. ;Swindon campus Oxford Brookes University opened its Swindon campus in August 2016. The university moved from the former Ferndale campus in Swindon to a new and larger campus situated to the west of the town centre at the Delta Business Park. The building is named the Joel Joffe Building after Lord Joel Joffe, long-time Swindon resident and former human-rights lawyer. Adult nursing, operating department practice (ODP) and a range of continuing professional development (CPD) courses are taught there. The campus features a 185-seat lecture theatre, library and social learning spaces, teaching rooms and three clinical skills suites.250x250pxOxford Brookes University partners with Swindon College as part of its Associate College Partnership to deliver foundation and degree courses, provides widening participation activity with local schools. Redevelopment In recent years the university has seen major redevelopments including the opening of the ¬£132 million John Henry Brookes Building, named after the University's spiritual leader, which opened on the Headington campus in 2014. It brings together the library and teaching spaces with student support services and the Students' Union (Brookes Union), who were formerly housed in the Helena Kennedy Centre on the Headington Hill site. The building has won multiple awards including a Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) National Award; three RIBA regional awards; Oxford Preservation Trust Award and the Student Experience category of the 2014 Education Estates Awards.The former main reception in 2013 In 2013 the redeveloped Abercrombie Building opened on the Headington campus, offering facilities for architecture students with design studios and collaborative learning spaces. In October 2014 it won the Architects' Journal Retrofit Award. In January 2015 Oxford Brookes University announced a major estates investment for the next 10 years, with ¬£13 million per year to be spent on redevelopment across all its campuses. This is to include additional building on the Headington and Harcourt campuses as well as a new campus in Swindon. Part of this investment will see all activity moved from the Wheatley campus by 2021/22. The Oxford Brookes Business School moved from the Wheatley campus to refurbished buildings at Headington campus in 2017 with other departments to move to new buildings on the Headington Hill site in 2020. The university's original redevelopment proposals were vigorously opposed by local residents in 2009 when presented to the local planning committee, with many undesirable aspects of the large student population in Oxford being discussed. However, the plans for the new building were eventually approved and building work began in 2010.

The region includes 21 counties west of the Tennessee River. It consists primarily of flat lands that have rich soil and vast floodplain areas for the Mississippi River. Of the three regions, West Tennessee is the most sharply defined geographically. It is bounded by the Mississippi River and the western Tennessee River Valley and is the lowest-lying of the three divisions. This region's boundaries have been expanded slightly to include all of Hardin County, which is bisected by the Tennessee River. The states of Kentucky and Mississippi provide the respective northern and southern boundaries, with the exception of a portion of Lauderdale County, Alabama, which lies southeast of Hardin County. As part of the Mississippi River basin, West Tennessee enjoys rich soil that led to large-scale cotton farming during the antebellum period and remains agriculturally significant today. The Grand Divisions, consisting of West Tennessee, Middle Tennessee, and East Tennessee, are also legally distinct. The earliest mention of this comes in the 1835-36 Acts of Tennessee, which states that the Supreme Court would hold one session each year in East Tennessee (Knoxville), Middle Tennessee (Nashville), and West Tennessee (Jackson). According to the State Constitution, no more than two of the Tennessee Supreme Court's five Justices can be residents of any one Grand Division and the Supreme Court rotates meeting in courthouses in each of the three divisions. The Supreme Court building for West Tennessee is in Jackson. Similar rules apply to certain other state commissions and boards, as well, to prevent them from showing any geographical biases. In 1883 when the federal government established time zones, a further division emerged as most of East Tennessee became part of the Eastern Time Zone while the rest of the state was assigned to Central. Though some counties on the borders occasionally change sides (Marion County has been part of both East and Middle Tennessee and is currently part of East Tennessee), the divisions remain a key part of what makes Tennessee unique. West Tennessee is less populous and smaller in land area than the other two Grand Divisions. As of 2016, estimates indicate that West Tennessee had 1,560,000 inhabitants, a decline of 1,200 residents in the six years since the 2010 U.S. Census. At the time of the 2000 U.S. Census, West Tennessee had 1,499,802 inhabitants living in its 21 counties, and these have a combined land area of approx. 27,582 km¬≤ (10,650 square mi). West Tennessee's population was about 26.4 percent of the state's total, and its land area is about 25.8 percent of the state's land area. West Tennessee's population density was about 140 persons per square mile (54.4 persons per square kilometer) at the time of the 2000 United States Census. Of the nearly 1.5 million persons living in West Tennessee at the time of the 2000 Census, approximately 650,000 of those lived in Memphis, or about 43.3% of the grand division's population. History While the region of Tennessee west of the Tennessee River was, on paper, part of Tennessee at its statehood in 1796, it had been recognized as Chickasaw territory by the 1786 Treaty of Hopewell, and it did not come under actual American control until it was obtained in a series of cessions by the Chickasaw in 1818, an acquisition known as the Jackson Purchase, and named for Andrew Jackson, one of the officials involved. The purchase also included the westernmost area of Kentucky as well as a part of northern Mississippi. Although the vast majority of the purchases lie in Tennessee, the term \\"Jackson Purchase\\" is used today mostly to refer solely to the Kentuckian portion of the acquisition. This term is also somewhat misleading. Jackson, a military officer at the time, was one of several federal treaty commissioners. He did not personally negotiate the whole land cession, nor was it done in a single treaty. Geography Low's Map of Kentucky and neighboring Territories did not yet include West Tennessee, controlled by the Chickasaw Nation until 1818. From Low's Encyclopaedia West Tennessee is located within the Mississippi Embayment, part of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Because of this, the terrain is flatter than the eastern parts of the state. Areas right along the Mississippi River are located within the alluvial floodplain. However, much of the western counties of the region are protected from flooding by the Chickasaw Bluffs, ridges of loess rising 50‚Äì200 feet above the floodplain. Although the land is lower and flatter than Middle and East Tennessee, some hilly terrain exists, especially along the bluffs bordering the Mississippi River and the land bordering the Tennessee River (known as the West Tennessee Highlands). Hilly land in these areas is forested. Otherwise, most of the land in West Tennessee is used as farmland. The soil in this part of the state comes from when a prehistoric sea dried up and left sediment in its place. Unlike in the rest of the state, bedrock is buried a few thousand feet below the surface. Hydrology Several rivers and streams, besides the Mississippi and Tennessee, exist in West Tennessee. All of them were originally slowly moving swamps or low-gradient meandering streams before nearly all of them were channelized in the 20th century. Rivers that empty into the Mississippi River include the Obion River, Forked Deer River, Hatchie River (which has not been channelized), Loosahatchie River, Wolf River, and Nonconnah Creek. Rivers that empty into the Tennessee River include the Big Sandy River and Beech River. Aquifer West Tennessee sits on top of an artesian aquifer. This aquifer is the main source of water for Memphis and Shelby County, as well as many other communities. In the Memphis area and areas along the bluffs, the loess and gravel serves as a cap over the sand making up the aquifer. The rest of West Tennessee serves as a recharge area for the aquifer. This aquifer provides some of the cleanest water in the United States. Earthquake risk The entire West Tennessee region, especially the area closest to the Mississippi River, lies in a zone of fairly high estimated risk for earthquakes. This area is at the edge of the New Madrid Seismic Zone. In 1811 and 1812, three of the largest quakes in American history hit this region back when it had few European settlers. By some reports, the earthquakes briefly reversed the flow of the Mississippi River.Feldman, Jay. When the Mississippi Ran Backwards : Empire, Intrigue, Murder, and the New Madrid Earthquakes New York: Free Press, 2005. A lasting legacy of the earthquakes is the Reelfoot Lake, a large but shallow body of water in northwestern Tennessee that was created by the earthquakes. Counties There are 21 counties in West Tennessee: *Benton *Carroll *Chester *Crockett *Decatur *Dyer *Fayette *Gibson *Hardeman *Hardin *Haywood *Henderson *Henry *Lake *Lauderdale *Madison *McNairy *Obion *Shelby *Tipton *Weakley Cities ;Cities and towns with 10,000+ population (2010 Census)U.S. Census Bureau State & County QuickFacts http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/47/4775940.html Seven of the thirteen cities in West Tennessee with a population greater than 10,000 are located within Shelby County, which comprises Memphis and its six suburbs. *Memphis (662,897) *Jackson (65,211) *Bartlett (54,613) *Collierville (43,965) *Germantown (38,844) *Dyersburg (17,145) *Lakeland (12,430) *Arlington (11,517) *Martin (11,473) *Union City (10,895) *Brownsville (10,292) *Millington (10,176) *Paris (10,156) Demographics West Tennessee is by slight amounts less populous and smaller in land area than the other two Grand Divisions. At the time of the 2000 U.S. Census West Tennessee had 1,499,802 inhabitants living in its 21 counties, and these have a combined land area of approx. 27,582 km¬≤ (10,650 square mi). West Tennessee's population was about 26.4 percent of the state's total, and its land area is about 25.8 percent of the state's land area. West Tennessee's population density was about 140 persons per square mile (54.4 persons per square kilometer) at the time of the 2000 United States Census. West Tennessee registered a population growth rate significantly below the state and national average (11.5% and 9.7% respectively) from 2000 to 2010, significantly less than that of Middle and East Tennessee (18.0% and 10.4%). West Tennessee's population grew only 4.2 percent during the 10-year period; predominantly black Haywood County was the most rapidly diminishing county in the state, losing 5.1% of its population. Only three counties (Chester, Fayette, and Tipton, all increasingly playing a role as bedroom suburbs of metropolitan areas) recorded a growth rate of more than 10 percent from 2000 to 2010. Many West Tennessee counties are not on the state's major transportation routes (railroads or highways) and have no air transport to speak of; and rely heavily on agriculture. With fewer farms and farmers, and the continuing decline of manufacturing, economic opportunities diminish in these counties, and young residents look outside the area for jobs, leading to substantial out-migration. Thus, the population in West Tennessee is increasingly older, with median ages above the state average in most counties; and the over-65 age group constitutes a larger percentage of the total population than the state average, leading in turn to a below- replacement-rate birth/death ratio, and economic decline, including empty and neglected housing and business structures.Moser, H. Ronald and John, Horace E. \\"Tennessee Population Growth 2000-2010\\" Tennessee Business October 2011 Congressional Districts West Tennessee is represented by part of the 7th district, and all of the 8th and 9th districts. The 7th district covers Benton, Decatur, Henderson, Hardeman, Chester, McNairy, and Hardin counties. The 8th district represents the remaining counties except for Memphis and Millington, which are represented by the 9th district. Area codes Until the year 2001, West Tennessee, including all of Hardin County, was in the area code 901. After a large amount of population growth necessitated two area codes for West Tennessee, Memphis, its northern and eastern suburbs, as well as Fayette and Tipton counties, retained the 901 area code, with the remainder of West Tennessee being placed into area code 731. The Memphis area is one of the largest metropolitan areas that does not require 10-digit dialing, and it is anticipated it will remain this way for many years to come. Transportation=Roads and highways West Tennessee currently has four interstate highways running through it. The longest one is Interstate 40, which runs for from the Mississippi River in Memphis, passes south of Brownsville, north of Jackson, and crosses the Tennessee River in Benton County. Interstate 240 is a bypass route of I-40 and runs to the south of Memphis. Interstate 55 runs for from the Mississippi state line to the Mississippi River, all of which are within southwest Memphis. Interstate 155 is located in the northwestern part of West Tennessee. It runs from the Mississippi River to Dyersburg. Future Interstate 69 will go from South Fulton and pass through Union City, Dyersburg, Ripley, Covington, Millington, and Memphis. Interstate 269 will serve as an outer beltway for Memphis running to the east of it. The U.S. Highways that travel through West Tennessee are: *U.S. Route 45 *U.S. Route 51 *U.S. Route 61 *U.S. Route 64 *U.S. Route 70 *U.S. Route 72 *U.S. Route 78 *U.S. Route 79 *U.S. Route 412 *U.S. Route 641 Rail transport Freight railways crisscross West Tennessee. Norfolk Southern maintains a line running through the southern counties from Memphis to the shoals area of Alabama. They also maintain a line which runs from South Fulton through Martin, Milan, Jackson, and Selmer crossing into Mississippi. Canadian National runs a line from South Fulton, through Union City, Dyersburg and Memphis. From here the line splits into two: one runs through the Mississippi Delta and the other one runs through the center of Mississippi. BNSF runs through Memphis from Mississippi to downtown Memphis, crossing the River on the Frisco Bridge. Union Pacific maintains a short line through Memphis crossing the river on the Harahan Bridge and connects with other lines in the area. CSX runs a line from Memphis through Memphis, Brownsville, Humboldt, Milan, McKenzie, and Camden, then crossing the Tennessee River. Many other short line railroads exist scattered throughout the region. There are three intermodal facilities around the Memphis area. One is operated by Norfolk Southern in Rossville, one operated by BNSF in Southeast Memphis, and one operated by Canadian National in Southwest Memphis. Amtrak runs the City of New Orleans passenger rail service along the CN rail line. There are two stops in West Tennessee along this route, which are in Downtown Memphis at Central Station and in Newbern north of Dyersburg. Airports West Tennessee has one international airport, Memphis International Airport. This is the largest freight airport in the United States and the second largest in the world. Two regional airports exist: McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport is located outside of Jackson and Dyersburg Regional Airport southwest of Dyersburg. In addition to these, several general aviation exist along with two former military airstrips. Arnold Field in Lauderdale County maintains an airstrip and Millington Regional Jetport serves as a backup landing strip for FedEx. Universities and colleges The public universities and colleges in West Tennessee are the University of Memphis, the University of Tennessee at Martin, Dyersburg State Community College, Jackson State Community College, Southwest Tennessee Community College, and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, which has state medical, dental, nursing, and pharmacy schools, as well as a graduate program in health sciences. The University of Memphis has a branch campus in Jackson after taking over the former Lambuth University campus. Private institutions of higher education located in the region include Christian Brothers University, LeMoyne‚ÄìOwen College, and Rhodes College in Memphis. Jackson is the home of Union University and Lane College. A few other private institutions of higher education lie in other areas of West Tennessee, such as Bethel University and Freed-Hardeman University. Discovery Park of America in Union City, Tennessee.  Museums  West Tennessee is home to over 80 public and private museums, including such renowned institutions as Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, Graceland, and Discovery Park of America.

Madero: Apostle of Democracy, esp. chap. XII \\"The White President\\" pp. 188-202. New York: Columbia University Press 1955 p. 188 BiographyEarly Career Le√≥n de la Barra was the son of a Chilean immigrant to Mexico. He obtained a degree in law in Quer√©taro before entering politics as a federal deputy in 1891. In 1892, he attended the Ibero-American Judicial Conference held in Madrid on the occasion of the four hundredth anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America. In 1896, Le√≥n de la Barra entered the Mexican diplomatic corps, serving as envoy to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States (1909‚Äì11). He was Mexico's representative at The Hague peace conference in 1907. During this time, he earned a reputation as an authority on international law. When the Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910, he was Ambassador to the U.S. Following the fraudulent elections of 1910, revolutionary forces rose up against Porfirio D√≠az (r. 1876-80; 1884-1911), defeating the Federal Army and forcing his resignation as President. In the 21 May 1911 Treaty of Ciudad Ju√°rez, Le√≥n de la Barra was selected to be interim president, until elections could be held in the autumn of 1911. He was not a politician or a member of D√≠az's Cient√≠ficos, but rather a diplomat and lawyer. President of Mexico He served as president until November 6, 1911, when Madero took office 6 November 1911 as the duly-elected president. Although considered by conservatives the benign \\"White President,\\" the German ambassador to Mexico, Paul von Hintze, who associated with the Interim President, said of him that \\"De la Barra wants to accommodate himself with dignity to the inevitable advance of the ex-revolutionary influence, while accelerating the widespread collapse of the Madero party....\\"quoted in Friedrich Katz, The Secret War in Mexico. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1981, pp. 40-41. There were pressures for Le√≥n de la Barra to run for the presidency himself, but he resisted. He did promote democracy and the elections that brought Madero to the presidency were considered free and fair. There was a controversy during the summer of 1911 when fighting broke out in the streets of Puebla between federal soldiers and irregulars who supported Madero. President Le√≥n de la Barra blamed his Minister of the Interior, Emilio V√°zquez G√≥mez, the brother of Madero's vice presidential running mate, Francisco V√°zquez G√≥mez for the violence and its mishandling. Madero replaced his running mate with Jos√© Mar√≠a Pino Su√°rez.Henderson, 1997, p. 397. In his inauguration address to the nation, Le√≥n de la Barra had three stated goals: the restoration of order, bringing about free and fair elections, and the continuation of reforms promised at the end of the D√≠az presidency.Henderson 1997, p. 396. Since Madero had called on his revolutionary followers to lay down their arms, despite their having brought about conditions forcing D√≠az's resignation, there was continuing turmoil in areas where they had mobilized. He sought to disarm the irregular forces, remove them from the army payroll, and send them home. In Morelos, Emiliano Zapata and his followers resisted demobilization, and Le√≥n de la Barra sent troops under General Victoriano Huerta to put down the rebellion. Huerta failed to do that, but did wreak havoc in Morelos, burning villages and attacking the local population. Rebellions in other parts of the country, in Baja California, Oaxaca, and Chiapas were successfully repressed.Henderson, 1997, p. 397. During his presidency, he did implement some reforms, including improved funding for rural schools; promoting some aspects of agrarian reform to increase the amount of productive land; labor reforms including workman's compensation and the eight-hour day; but also the right of the government to intervene in strikes. According to historian Peter V.N. Henderson, Le√≥n de la Barra's and congress's actions \\"suggests that few Porfirians wished to return to the status quo of the dictatorship. Rather, the thoughtful, progressive members of the Porfirian meritocracy recognized the need for change.\\"Henderson, 1997, p. 397. Subsequent career Le√≥n de la Barra ran for the Mexican Congress in 1912 and was elected a senator, aligned with the Cient√≠ficos and the National Catholic Party.Womack, John Jr. \\"The Mexican Revolution\\" in Mexico Since Independence, ed. Leslie Bethell. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 138. Le√≥n de la Barra colluded with U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Henry Lane Wilson to oust Madero from the presidency.Womack, \\"The Mexican Revolution\\", p. 139. During the Ten Tragic Days of February 1913, Madero resigned and was then assassinated. During the regime of Victoriano Huerta he served briefly as Foreign Minister and then was appointed ambassador to France (1913-14). He retired to Europe and became president of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, located in The Hague. He participated in various international commissions after World War I and wrote many works on judicial and administrative affairs. In early 1939, Le√≥n de la Barra was used by the French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet as an unofficial diplomat to begin talks with General Francisco Franco for French recognition of the Spanish Nationalists as the legitimate government of Spain. The Spanish Nationalists overthrew the Second Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War, allying with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. As a result of the talks Le√≥n de la Barra began, France recognized the Spanish Nationalists in February 1939. Anyone associated with the Huerta regime has been tainted in modern Mexican history by the association, including Francisco Le√≥n de la Barra. Personal life and death He married Mar√≠a Elena Barneque, and when she died he married her sister, Mar√≠a del Refugio Barneque. He died in Biarritz on September 23, 1939, without ever returning to Mexico.

This poem is carefully built upon a palindromic structure and uses lines with slightly changed variants and exact repetitions.

It was created circa 1230 for William de Moravia and is the premier earldom in the Peerage of Scotland. The Earl or Countess of Sutherland is also the Chief of Clan Sutherland. The original line of earls of Sutherland had the surname \\"de Moravia\\" although they sometimes used the surname \\"Sutherland\\", taken from their hereditary title. The name de Moravia meant \\"of Moray\\" or \\"of Murray\\". The de Moravias who were Earls of Sutherland and chiefs of Clan Sutherland, arguably shared their early paternal ancestry with the chiefs of Clan Murray through their shared progenitor Freskin de Moravia. Various branches of the Murray Clan claim descent from Freskin, including those who were Earls and later Dukes of Atholl. Current research is underway via male line Y-DNA studies in collaboration with both branches of these clans in order to determine if any modern branches share an early medieval ancestor . Elizabeth de Moravia, 10th Countess of Sutherland, married Adam Gordon, a younger son of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly, chief of Clan Gordon. Their first son is Alexander Gordon, Master of Sutherland, whose descendants were several of the next Earls of Sutherland, who all used the surname Gordon. The title was again held by a long string of men, until the death of William Gordon, 18th Earl, without sons, when the title passed to his daughter Elizabeth. Elizabeth, 19th Countess of Sutherland then married George Granville Leveson-Gower in 1785; he inherited the title of Marquess of Stafford from his father in 1803. The Marquess held vast lands and wealth, having inherited from his father, the first Marquess of Stafford, from his maternal uncle, the second Duke of Bridgewater, and also holding much property associated with the Earldom of Sutherland, which belonged to his wife. He was made Duke of Sutherland in 1833. The Duke's son, also named George, inherited the Earldom of Sutherland from his mother and the Dukedom of Sutherland from his father. The two titles continued united until the death of the fifth Duke in 1963. The Earldom passed to his niece Elizabeth, while the Dukedom had to pass to a male heir. The subsidiary title associated with the Earldom is Lord Strathnaver (created 1230), which is used as a courtesy title by the Earl's or Countess's eldest son and heir. The family seat is Dunrobin Castle, near Golspie, Sutherland in Scotland. Ancestors of the Earls of Sutherland Lozenge-shaped arms of the Countess of Sutherland Sources give different accounts of the ancestors of the Earls of Sutherland. The generally published ancestry is that William de Moravia (William Sutherland), 1st Earl of Sutherland in the peerage of Scotland (died 1284) was the son of Hugh de Moravia, who in turn was a grandson of Freskin, a Flemish knight.Sutherland, Malcolm. (1996). A Fighting Clan, Sutherland Officers: 12501850. Page 3. Avon Books. . Sir Robert Gordon, 1580-1656 and Historian, House of Sutherland, a younger son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, states that William de Moravia (William Sutherland), 1st Earl of Sutherland (died 1284) was the son of Hugh, Earl of Sutherland who was nicknamed Hugh Freskin, who was in turn son of Robert Sutherland (Earl of Sutherland and founder of Dunrobin Castle), who was son of Walter Southerland (Earl of Sutherland), who was son of Alane Southerland, Thane of Sutherland. Accordingly, this line of Sutherlands believed themselves to be descended from native residents of Southerland, and not Freskin, an early medieval Flemish resident of Moray.

Earls of Sutherland Dunrobin Castle has similar architecture and partly exposed semi-green foundations as some medieval French castles such as Josselin Castle but is of the pan-19th century Scottish Baronial architecture with a formal french garden and is the seat of the Earls or Countesses of Sutherland - a title which passes to eldest female heirs on lack of male heirs. Although the original line of Earls had the surname \\"de Moravia\\" in the direct male line, historian Sir Robert Gordon, who was a younger son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, states in his book A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland that the original line in fact used the surname \\"Sutherland\\".Gordon, Sir Robert.

With roughly 63,000 species in thousands of genera, the group is currently recognized as the largest extant family of organisms. It is an ancient group, with fossilized rove beetles known from the Triassic, 200 million years ago, and possibly even earlier if the genus Leehermania proves to be a member of this family. They are an ecologically and morphologically diverse group of beetles, and commonly encountered in terrestrial ecosystems. One well-known species is the devil's coach horse beetle. For some other species, see list of British rove beetles. Anatomy As might be expected for such a large family, considerable variation exists among the species. Sizes range from <1 to , with most in the 2‚Äì8 mm range, and the form is generally elongated, with some rove beetles being ovoid in shape. Colors range from yellow and red to reddish-brown to brown to black to iridescent blue and green. The antennae usually have 11 segments and are filiform, with moderate clubbing in some genera. The abdomen may be very long and flexible, and some rove beetles superficially resemble earwigs. Some members of Paederina (specifically the genus Paederus), a subtribe of Paederinae, contain a potent vesicant in their haemolymph that can produce a skin irritation called dermatitis linearis,, also known as Paederus dermatitis. The irritant pederin is highly toxic, more potent than cobra venom. Image:Ocypus spec.jpgOcypus sp.

Most rove beetles are predators of insects and other invertebrates, living in forest leaf litter and similar decaying plant matter. They are also commonly found under stones, and around freshwater margins. Almost 400 species are known to live on ocean shores that are submerged at high tide, including the pictured rove beetle, although these are much fewer than 1% of the worldwide total of Staphylinidae. Other species have adapted to live as inquilines in ant and termite colonies, and some live in mutualistic relationships with mammals whereby they eat fleas and other parasites, benefiting the host. A few species, notably those of the genus Aleochara, are scavengers and carrion feeders, or are parasitoids of other insects, particularly of certain fly pupae. Although rove beetles' appetites for other insects would seem to make them obvious candidates for biological control of pests, and empirically they are believed to be important controls in the wild, experiments using them have not been notably successful. Greater success is seen with those species that are parasitoids (genus Aleochara). Rove beetles of the genus Stenus are very interesting insects. They are specialist predators of small invertebrates such as collembola. Their labium can shoot out from the head using blood pressure. The thin rod of the labium ends in a pad of bristly hairs and hooks and between these hairs are small pores that exude an adhesive glue-like substance, which sticks to prey.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. Systematics Classification of the 63,650 (as of 2018) staphylinid species is ongoing and controversial, with some workers proposing an organization of as many as 10 separate families, but the current favored system is one of 32 subfamilies, about 167 tribes (some grouped into supertribes), and about 3,200 genera. About 400 new species are being described each year, and some estimates suggest three-quarters of tropical species are as yet undescribed. References * Ross H. Arnett, Jr. and Michael C.

He was the power behind the throne during the very short presidency of his conspirator Bruno Carranza, whom he replaced after a period of three months. The following year he enacted Costa Rica's 1871 Constitution, which remained in force until 1948. On 8 May 1876 he surrendered the presidency to Aniceto Esquivel. He continued to pull the strings of power during Esquivel's short term in office and that of Esquivel's successor Vicente Herrera, before reassuming the presidency himself on 11 September 1877. He abolished the death penalty later that year. He remained in office until his death.
